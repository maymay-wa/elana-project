a single round of treatment with an experimental 
new medicine appears to be highly effective against a rare form of 
leukemia and may help fight other kinds of blood cancer as well 
says a study published today 
the new drug was developed at scripps clinic and research 
foundation in la jolla calif where doctors tested it on patients 
with hairy cell leukemia in almost every case the medicine erased 
all signs of the disease 
hairy cell leukemia affects the white blood cells that make 
diseasefighting antibodies doctors are also testing the drug 
against chronic lymphocytic leukemia nonhodgkins lymphoma and 
cutaneous t cell lymphoma 
the scripps doctors concluded that the medicine called 
2chlorodeoxyadenosine or 2cda may well be the drug of choice 
in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia 
the study was directed by dr lawrence d piro and published in 
the new england journal of medicine 
in their study doctors gave the drug to 12 patients of these 
11 have remained completely free of all signs of the disease for 
periods up to four years 
the doctors cautioned that longer followup will be necessary 
before they can be sure they have actually cured the disease 
two other treatments for hairy cell leukemia have been developed 
in recent years they are interferon and deoxycoformycin a drug 
that is similar to 2cda however interferon is less effective 
and both of those treatments produce serious side effects 
by contrast the only unwanted effect of 2cda was a few days of 
fever patients experienced no nausea hair loss rashes or other 
symptoms typical of cancer therapy also unlike other treatments 
this one appears to work after a single sevenday course of therapy 
the scripps clinic reached an agreement recently with johnson amp 
johnsons ortho pharmaceuticals to produce the drug which is not 
yet approved for routine use

poor patients cost hospitals more to treat than 
affluent ones a study today concludes 
the study conducted in massachusetts found that poor patients 
were hospitalized 3 percent to 30 percent longer than betteroff 
patients depending on the hospital and their bills were 1 percent 
to 18 percent higher 
the researchers did not attempt to learn why the poor needed to 
stay in the hospital longer 
medicare already pays more to hospitals that take care of large 
numbers of poor people the researchers said their work suggests 
that all hospitals not just those with high numbers should get 
extra for their poor patients 
medicare pays hospitals flat fees for specific illnesses but it 
does not give more money if patients are unusually sick and need 
longer stays 
the doctors whose findings were published in the new england 
journal of medicine based their conclusions on a review of the 
cases of 16908 people admitted to five massachusetts hospitals in 
1987 
the study was directed by dr arnold m epstein of brigham and 
womens hospital in boston

leo lemay thinks he knows what ben franklin 
would do if he returned to his adopted city and saw the hoopla 
surrounding the 200th anniversary of his death 
first of all hed have a good time said the university of 
delaware professor of english and an organizer of a scholarly 
conference thats one of several events this week marking april 17 
1790 
it was on that date that the 84yearold franklin weakened by 
gout and kidney stones died succumbing to a fever and an abscess 
in his left lung 
he knew it was coming as early as 1786 he wrote having seen 
during a long life a good deal of this world i feel a growing 
curiosity to be acquainted with some other 
the outpouring of grief at the april 21 funeral included a 
halfmilelong procession watched by throngs that filled streets 
and rooftops 
come saturday a more joyful parade will celebrate his full life 
we dont want anyone standing on the curb watching this parade 
we want everyone in it said hobart cawood superintendent of 
independence national historical park 
among the invited participants are those whose lives or 
professions were touched by franklins legacy and since he was a 
printer publisher journalist builder folk philosopher patriot 
inventor scientist diplomat and politician thats a lot of 
lives touched 
weve got many other groups that are associated with 
franklin cawood said such as the first insurance company 
which he founded pennsylvania hospital which he founded the us 
postal service since he was the first postmaster general the fire 
department which he started all of these have units in the 
procession 
of course all americans have been touched by the declaration of 
independence and the constitution in which franklin had a hand 
ask someone who do you associate with philadelphia more 
than anyone else even though hes been dead 200 years people will 
say ben franklin throughout the world cawood said 
were not celebrating his funeral but after he died he left 
something very important behind he left institutions and 
organizations and a reputation and so many things that continue 
right up to this year 
franklin also bequeathed 1000 pounds sterling to pennsylvania 
and philadelphia in trust to provide lowinterest loans to young 
married artificers meaning apprentices starting their own 
businesses 
he made a similar bequest to massachusetts and boston the 
hometown he left as a 17yearold runaway 
franklin directed that the fund be dissolved 200 years after his 
death and split between city and state now comes the question of 
what to do with the money which today is worth about 45 million 
in massachusetts and 2 million in pennsylvania 
philadelphias share 520000 will be used to help students in 
the trades crafts and applied sciences a special commission 
announced tuesday 
franklin said laborers and handicraftsmen are the wealth and 
support of the nation and we are hoping that by these grants we 
may increase the number of competent handicraftsmen in 
philadelphia said whitfield bell commission chairman 
as for pennsylvanias share the state senate has passed a bill 
that would give the states 15 million to the franklin institute 
a philadelphia museum devoted to science and franklin in 
pennsylvania until now the franklin fund has been used to make 
mortgage loans at below market rates to low and moderateincome 
workers 
to lemay who has written several books on franklin he is one 
of the very greatest geniuses of the 18th century 
you can be interested in him as a great scientist probably 
the second greatest in the 18th century after newton and you can 
be interested in him as certainly the greatest writer of colonial 
america lemay said 
lemay helped bring together historians and professors from 
around the country as well as from france england and germany 
to discuss the great man at a conference reappraising benjamin 
franklin a bicentennial perspective 
among the topics eat not to dulness drink not to elevation 
franklins journalistic writings on drunkards and drinking 
franklin as crime reporter and benjamin franklin as founding 
father of american humor 
and of course the ageold debate was franklin too french

a teacher strike that has closed hundreds 
of schools since monday entered its fourth day today with 
oklahomas senate deadlocked on education spending 
organizers said they expected their largest demonstration of the 
week at the capitol today in part because teachers from oklahoma 
city the states secondlargest school district and lawton the 
thirdlargest are joining the strike 
at least 12000 teachers parents and students picketed at the 
capitol on wednesday elsewhere students staged walkouts at their 
open schools 
teachers are demanding more pay and higher school spending 
their 31000member union the oklahoma education association says 
oklahoma teachers rank 48th in pay among the states making 22000 
a year compared with the national average of 29648 
weve waited long enough was the message on stickers worn 
by many of the teachers referring to an 8monthold special 
session and the failure of the legislature to enact a 230 million 
school reform and tax bill 
the bill stalled in the senate last week when 13 of the 14 
republicans present and seven of the senates 33 democrats voted 
against a provision to make the bill effective immediately upon 
signing by republican gov henry bellmon 
many of the protesters have focused their lobbying efforts on 
the 20 senators who voted against the provision 
union president kyle dahlem said the walkout continues to gain 
momentum its incredible the broad support from the teachers 
parents and children dahlem said im at a loss for words 
the union which called for a fiveday walkout last week said 
at least 125 of oklahomas 606 school districts were closed 
wednesday about 60 percent or 343200 of the states 572000 
students have been affected 
more than 20000 of oklahoms estimated 35000 teachers have 
been off the job at various times the union said 
despite the walkout leaders of the democratic majority in the 
senate said nothing had developed in negotiations with republicans 
on a compromise that could lead to enactment of the school bill 
republican sen charles ford said he offered a compromise that 
pared the tax increase from about 230 million to 170 million 
deleting the sales tax proposal the proposal would raise personal 
and corporate income taxes 
senate president pro tempore bob cullison a democrat said the 
ford plan drew no support in a caucus of democrats 
education secretary sandy garrett said she thinks the public 
wants the school issue settled soon i think the public does not 
like strikes but wants the legislature to act she said

scientists say its only coincidence that 
earthquakes rocked and rolled asia indiana and three parts of 
california this week 
you do get the impression these things are related when they 
happen over a large area at about the same time said 
geophysicist don anderson of the california institute of technology 
in pasadena but when you do the statistics after the fact a 
link between these quakes never holds up 
they do seem to be happening at random 
scientists also dismiss as pure coincidence that tuesdays 
quakes happened exactly six months after the jolt that killed 
nearly 70 people in the san francisco bay area oct 17 and that 
wednesdays shakers happened on the anniversary of san franciscos 
catastrophic quake of 1906 
most also believe its only by chance that so many quakes 
happened during a twoday period this week 
if you look up history this kind of coincidence happens many 
times said caltech seismologist hiroo kanamori i dont think 
it is really statistically significant 
but anderson said its conceivable the temblors in three regions 
of california are linked by a gradual buildup of stress as the 
pacific plate of earths crust moves past the north american plate 
along the san andreas and related faults 
on tuesday a quake estimated at 62 to 64 on the richter scale 
rocked chinas northwest border with the soviet union in the los 
angeles basin seismologists recorded a magnitude46 aftershock 
and several smaller aftershocks of the magnitude55 upland quake 
of feb 28 a temblor of magnitude 25 to 3 jostled rural eastern 
indiana 
on wednesday about 75 quakes including one measuring 54 
shook watsonville a farming community south of san francisco bay 
that was hardhit by the oct 17 disaster scientists called the 
quakes aftershocks of the earlier temblor 
we figured it was all over said robert holleson a former 
watsonville resident who was visiting wednesday but the powers 
off the phones dead helicopters are flying all over its like 
its starting all over again 
also wednesday a major quake measuring 75 rocked the celebes 
sea between indonesia and the philippines and small quakes rattled 
southern californias desert near indio 
the national earthquake information center in golden colo 
reports 1200 to 1500 earthquakes of magnitude 4 or larger 
worldwide every month said pat jorgenson us geological survey 
spokeswoman in menlo park 
its not unusual two or more moderate to large earthquakes 
would occur on the same day she said 
the entire earth wobbles as it rotates because of tides 
atmospheric pressure wind friction and changes in the planets 
molten core 
most scientists believe such forces are too small in any local 
area to cause quakes but anderson said in places where earths 
crust is very close to the breaking point they might be just 
enough to trigger earthquakes 
he also said a longterm buildup of stress on the boundary 
between the pacific and north american plates could cause widely 
separated clusters of quakes in california 
kanamori countered that no one has documented a widespread 
stress buildup in californias crust

a pornographyfighting christian group is 
blanketing congress with envelopes it says contain filthy 
pictures of homosexual acts from a taxpayerfunded art exhibit 
each envelope marked extremely offensive material enclosed 
holds explicit photographs and drawings from the david 
wojnarowicz tongues of flame show mounted with a 15000 federal 
grant 
the american family association hopes a good look at 
reproductions of 14 images displayed at the university galleries at 
illinois state university will convince lawmakers to kill funding 
for the national endowment for the arts 
were spending 175 million in this area that benefits 
primarily the rich and the perverted the rev donald wildmon 
founder and director of the tupelo missbased association said 
wednesday 
but barry blinderman director of the galleries said the 
exhibitions beneficiaries were the 6000 students and middleclass 
residents of normal ill who turned up 
the show received excellent local coverage and the support of 
a supposedly conservative media here he said 
wildmon said he resorted to pictures to show congressmen just 
how taxpayer money was being spent 
someone once said that a picture is worth a thousand words 
wildmon said that sheet contained 14000 words what i sent to 
those congressmen is as filthy as anything ive ever seen 
wildmon also objected to a wojnarowicz collage that included an 
image of christ with a hypodermic needle 
blinderman defended the christ image as purely symbolic 
in no way is the artist trying to say christ was a heroin 
user its a poetic image thats placing the redeemer of mankind 
with a very contemporary issue blinderman said metaphor can 
be understood by common taxpayers christ himself spoke in parables 
so everybody could understand him clearly 
blinderman said the artists sexual images are presented as if 
the viewer is peering through a telescope 
the point of the work is that there is no one kind of 
sexuality in our country and they address the surveillance of what 
should be private activity he said 
some lawmakers say wildmons campaign is having an effect 
weve received 270 to 300 postcards or letters in the last 
month as a result of don wildmon writing to the constituents 
said an aide to rep james saxton rnj 
at this point its going to be very difficult for us to vote 
to fund the nea said aide jeff de korte 
although saxton supported endowment funding last year he voted 
to withhold 45000 for controversial exhibits of photographs by 
the late robert mapplethorpe which included explicit images of 
homosexual acts and by andres serrano which depicted a crucifix 
immersed in urine 
those works sparked criticism of the endowment which also 
provides seed money for mainstream artistic activities from opera 
to dance nationwide 
rep dean gallo another new jersey republican fired off a 
letter to endowment chairman john e frohnmayer on wednesday 
contending the agency showed poor judgment in supporting the 
illinois exhibit 
what is so unfortunate is that these few decisions could put 
many worthy local projects in jeopardy gallo wrote 
frankly support for the nea is fast disintegrating among members 
of congress and our constituencies 
frohnmayer and president bush have strongly opposed government 
censorship of the arts while saying taxpayers have no place 
financing obscenity 
wildmon said he also was sending the package of pictures to 
editors of daily newspapers nationwide 1000 christian radio 
stations 100 christian television stations and 3200 clergymen 
asked whether sending potentially obscene materials through mail 
might be illegal wildmon said he had consulted with the us 
postal service 
they told us that it could leave us open to prosecution 
but they doubted very seriously if there would be any government 
agency that would prosecute us the contradiction is this is 
governmentfunded material 
lawrence maxwell manager of the fraud and prohibited mailings 
branch of the us postal inspection service in washington said 
the courts have jurisdiction in determining what is pornographic 
anne murphy executive director of the american arts alliance a 
lobbying group for the arts pointed out that some of the most 
respected art has been shocking such as a goya altarpiece 
depicting christ with syphilis 
i think there are many people who are outraged by these pieces 
of art she said but for every one of those citizens who are 
outraged by the content of the art there is another citizen who is 
outraged by the idea that one minister will set the standards for 
the rest of the country

soon after security forces unleashed the 
bloodiest crackdown in nepals modern history bijay bahadur yanked 
a picture of king birendra from his paint shop wall and threw it in 
the attic 
the same day he also took a handful of rice from his meager 
lunch and placed it on a rectangular metal plate as part of a 
ritual to feed the king and his forefathers 
his actions highlight a contradiction in nepal the worlds only 
hindu kingdom the monarchy is losing power in a groundswell for 
democracy but for many people the king remains a living god 
bahadur said he pulled down the portrait because he was angry 
with the king for the april 6 crackdown 
it was a matter of respect which had vanished he said 
on that day security forces fired into a crowd of 200000 
protesters calling for democracy witnesses said police killed 
about 200 people the government claimed only 10 died 
while gunfire was still echoing through the city garment seller 
nima churing his wife and their four children gathered under 
birendras picture lit incense sticks filled seven small glasses 
with holy water and bowed their heads 
churing who like bahadur also lives in the narrowlaned 
chatrapati area of katmandu repeated the prayers the next morning 
as soldiers with shootonsight orders patrolled the curfewbound 
capital 
we have done these prayers all our lives our forefathers did 
it throughout their lives how can we stop it asked churing 
the belief that the king is a living god was propagated early in 
the 18th century when snakes prevented king pratap malla from going 
to a temple of the hindu god vishnu 
court astrologers explained the incident by saying pratap was 
the reincarnation of vishnu and the holy snakes did not want the 
king to pray to himself 
the tradition continued after birendras ancestor prithvi 
narayan shah vanquished the malla dynasty and set up his kingdom 
encompassing most of presentday nepal in 1769 
even today many people especially in remote villages believe 
that seeing the king can wash away their sins 
but while a majority of nepals 17 million people 75 percent 
of whom are illiterate worship the king as a god the educated 
and urban population is tearing itself away from the belief 
when i worship the king it is an inadvertent reaction of my 
psyche said bahadur but i certainly do not believe that the 
king is a god 
it was this educated and urban elite that led the seven weeks of 
prodemocracy protests that forced birendra to lift a 29year ban 
on political parties this week the king agreed to accept his 
kingdoms first oppositionled government in nearly three decades 
during the demonstrations slogans and graffiti were directed 
against birendra and the royal family for the first time 
birendra was depicted as a weak leader dominated by his wife 
aishwarya 
birendra hides behind the queens petticoat was one chant 
that was often heard birendra thief leave the throne was 
another 
many intellectuals believe members of the royal family are 
involved in antique and gold smuggling queen aishwarya is often 
referred to as nepals imelda marcos a reference to the wife of 
the late philippine president 
there has been little effort to prove the accusations because 
criticizing the royalty is illegal 
despite the discontent political observers and newly legalized 
political parties agree that the monarchy will remain intact and 
that the king will most likely become a constitutional monarch 
it will be a long time before the institution of the monarchy 
goes away the nepalese people are not ready to sever a part of 
their lives suddenly said former foreign minister dilli raj 
regmi 
arbinda shrestha a bank clerk who took part in prodemocracy 
demonstrations calls birendra a symbol of unity 
my political feelings may be there but i still want the king 
to stay he said 
many others support birendra and blame his cabinet ministers for 
the crackdown and mass arrests 
the king was ok only his government was bad said shiva 
manda a film magazine reporter 
the peoples feelings are echoed by the nepali congress party 
which is to head an interim government and its junior partner the 
sevenparty united left front coalition 
with the fronts taking part in the government nepal becomes 
the only country in the world where communists have joined hands 
with a monarchy

soaring health care costs could bankrupt the 
medicare trust fund that pays for hospital care before the turn of 
the century the funds board of trustees says 
in its annual report to congress the board said early 
corrective action is essential in order to avoid the need for 
later potentially precipitous changes 
the hospital insurance trust fund is financed with payroll 
taxes while currently more than four covered workers support each 
beneficiary that ratio will start slipping early in the next 
century by the middle of the next century there will be just two 
covered workers supporting each beneficiary 
not only are the anticipated reserves and financing of the 
hospital insurance program inadequate to offset this demographic 
change the trust fund is projected to become exhausted even before 
the major demographic shift begins to occur said the report 
released wednesday 
if economic growth is moderate the medicare hospital insurance 
trust fund will run out of money between 2003 and 2005 the board 
said 
under optimistic economic assumptions funds would be exhausted 
in 2018 but under a pessimistic scenario the fund could run dry 
in 1999 the board said 
these findings underline the urgency of our task in containing 
health care costs and spending our health care dollars more 
effectively and efficiently health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan said 
the projected bankruptcy date is a staple of the boards annual 
reports in the early 1980s it predicted bankruptcy in the 1990s 
but the date slipped back as cuts were made in the medicare program 
and more optimistic forecasts were used later in the decade 
medicares other trust fund the supplemental medical insurance 
trust fund is actuarially sound that is it should have 
enough money to meet its obligations the board said but the 
trustees said they were concerned about the soaring costs of the 
program which pays medicare part b expenses physician and 
outpatient services 
growth rates have been so rapid that outlays have nearly 
doubled in the last five years the board said 
about 75 percent of the money in the supplemental medical 
insurance trust fund comes from general federal revenues and 25 
percent comes from premiums paid by beneficiaries 
the medicare program provides medical benefits to about 30 
million americans age 65 and older and 3 million disabled 
individuals 
the board also reported that the social security trust funds 
that support benefits for the elderly survivors and the disabled 
will remain financially sound well into the next century 
trustees estimated the next costofliving benefit increase for 
social security recipients would be 45 percent this would be 
considered the 1990 increase though it would not be paid until 
beginning in january 1991 the last increase for 1989 was 47 
percent reflected in checks last january 
the old age and survivors insurance and disability insurance 
trust funds will take in more money than they pay out for the next 
several decades 
those two trust funds are taking in 316 billion and paying out 
254 billion in the current fiscal year the hospital fund will 
take in about 803 billion and pay 638 billion the supplemental 
fund will take in 462 billion and pay 444 billion 
based on intermediate assumptions total income to the two 
social security trust funds over the next 75 years is estimated to 
cover about 935 percent of the total amount paid out 
because the trust funds are projected to remain solvent for the 
next 20 to 30 years the trustees recommended no changes in either 
financing or benefits in the social security programs 
the voting members of the social security board of trustees 
include the secretaries of treasury labor and hhs as well as two 
public members for which nominations are pending

financier charles h keating jr ended eight 
days on the witness stand by rejecting a government lawyers 
suggestion that he tried to have every savings and loan regulator 
who challenged him removed or fired 
however keating acknowledged wednesday that he pursued his 
complaints about one top official as high as thenwhite house chief 
of staff donald regan 
had i been listened to this country would be 500 billion 
better off keating told james murphy attorney for the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision who is defending the 
governments april 1989 seizure of keatings lincoln savings and 
loan association in irvine calif 
keating denied a suggestion by murphy representing the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision that he regarded 
regulators who had confronted him as motivated by animosity and had 
tried to have them fired or removed from his case 
but asked if he had tried to get edwin gray fired as chairman of 
the federal home loan bank board predecessor of the thrift office 
keating replied i spoke with the administration about it yes i 
thought he was wrecking the industry 
in response to a question by us district judge stanley 
sporkin keating identified regan as the administration official 
with whom he spoke he told reporters later he did not believe the 
meeting at regans office influenced the chief of staff who he 
said had been unhappy with gray long before 
gray has said regan tried to force him to resign before his term 
expired at the end of june 1987 
the meeting with regan is only one example of keatings 
political reach five senators who accepted political contributions 
from him are under investigation by the senate ethics committee for 
meeting with regulators on his behalf in april 1987 
earlier wednesday keating testily rejected murphys suggestion 
that he had used lincoln in an attempt to entice saudi arabian 
investors into supporting his arizona real estate ventures 
murphy introduced documents showing that keating tried in 
february and march 1989 to obtain a 375 million loan from the 
saudi european bank on behalf of american continental corp 
lincolns parent firm 
at the same time lincoln put up more than 13 million in two 
other deals with the saudis in one lincoln paid 576 million to 
buy the saudis interest in a california real estate development 
in the other lincoln provided 75 million of an 8 million loan 
from the saudis to a holding company in the dutch antilles 
the contention that keating used the federally insured deposits 
in lincoln to benefit american continental his phoenixbased 
holding company is a key point in the governments justification 
for seizing lincoln 
officials say the sampls collapse will cost taxpayers an 
estimated 2 billion to cover federally insured deposits 
keating said he had no knowledge of the deals between lincoln 
and the saudis and that his own efforts to obtain a loan from the 
saudis were unrelated 
wednesdays testimony marked the 25th day of hearings on the 
governments motion to dismiss keatings suit sporkin said he 
would give the government through friday to present any rebuttal 
witnesses he eventually could decide to uphold the seizure find 
it invalid or order a full trial of the matter

nearly onethird of the 350 subsidized housing 
projects held by a prominent democratic fundraiser have financial 
or physical problems a top federal housing official says 
francis a keating general counsel of the department of housing 
and urban development defended on wednesday the departments 
suspension last january of a bruce rozet from hud contracts over 
concerns about management of a handful of projects with which he 
was connected 
keating acknowledged to a house subcommittee that hud took the 
action based on evidence involving only a small number of 
properties 
but he said the troubled projects were symptomatic of larger 
problems involving rozets web of affiliated corporate entities 
and that more than 100 of the properties in his portfolio were 
classified as financially or physically troubled 
the overriding concern from huds perspective is that because 
of abuse of the system and misuse or misappropriation of federal 
government resources thousands of families are forced to live in 
shameful conditions keating said 
rozet has been engaged in a dispute with hud and secretary jack 
kemp who in january suspended rozet and his corporations from any 
new department contracts 
hud acted after alleging that housing resources management an 
affiliate of rozets associated financial corp misused government 
and tenant funds at developments in oklahoma and washington dc 
rozet is appealing the suspension before an administrative law 
judge 
rozet in a telephone interview from california defended his 
companies handling of housing projects and said keatings comments 
reflected a failure to understand how subsidized housing operates 
he said that one washington dc project his firm managed 
remains in bad condition a year after it was turned over to hud he 
said keating failed to mention that hud has taken no steps to begin 
asbestos removal a costly procedure that prompted the owners to 
give up the project 
they are clearly the slum landlords they are clearly the ones 
who are perpetuating the conditions and imposing them on the 
tenants rozet said they are doing exactly what they 
accused us of doing 
rozet has been a major fundraiser for prominent democratic 
officials and candidates including sen alan cranston dcalif 
and jesse jackson 
keating appeared before the house banking finance and urban

the state departments deputy chief of 
protocol drew a 648 fine for trying to evade duties on two furs 
she purchased during an official trip to argentina a customs 
service spokesman says 
jennifer fitzgerald a longtime friend of president bush paid 
the fine to customs for misdescribing the value of a furlined 
raincoat and for failing to declare a silver fox cape spokesman ed 
kittredge said wednesday 
state department spokesman margaret tutwiler said customs and 
the departments inspector general began a joint investigation 
following an anonymous phone call to a complaint hot line in 
january 
fitzgerald had traveled to argentina as a member of the us 
delegation to the inauguration of president carlos menem six months 
earlier she was summoned in march with her coats to the customs 
service office in baltimore 
government aircraft used by state department delegations fly 
from andrews air force base in maryland 
one coat was a raincoat that she had listed on her declaration 
as valued at 300 but actually it was lined with nutria fur 
said kittredge that changes the situation nutria is similar 
to beaver fur 
kittredge said customs officials valued the coat at 1100 and 
fined fitzgerald 440 for violating the services fraud statute 
she also was fined 208 for failing to declare the cape valued 
at 1300 said kittredge 
duties are not normally collected on furs from argentina he 
said but fitzgerald was penalized because she had reported her 
purchases inaccurately 
efforts to reach fitzgerald by telephone for comment were 
unsuccessful 
the case was referred to the us attorneys office in 
baltimore where prosecutors decided against further action 
thats routine said kittredge 
fitzgerald whom bush appointed to the protocol job first 
worked as an aide to the president in 1970 when he was us envoy

the supreme court is arming law enforcement 
officials with a powerful new weapon to wipe out child pornography 
and its contemptible exploitation of children antipornography 
groups say 
the court in a 63 ruling wednesday said states may make it a 
crime to possess or look at child pornography even in ones home 
while the dissenters said the decision tramples on rights of 
free expression and privacy others were jubilant and predicted 
states will follow the courts blueprint and enact tough new laws 
beverly lahaye of concerned women for america said every state 
should take advantage of this decision and immediately begin to 
crack down on this depraved and contemptible exploitation of 
children 
this decision will help state law enforcement officials 
throughout america shut down highly organized private networks of 
pedophiles who trade pictures of their victims said jerry kirk 
head of the national coalition against pornography its vital 
that we realize that there is no child pornography without there 
first being the tragic molestation of a young child 
in other rulings the court 
said federal judges may order local officials to raise property 
taxes to pay for the racial desegregation of public schools while 
ruling unanimously in a kansas city mo case that judges 
themselves generally may not impose such tax increases the court 
voted 54 to empower judges to tell school officials to do so 
decided 72 that an overnight guest in a private home enjoys 
the same privacy protection as the homeowner against unreasonable 
police arrests and searches the decision struck down the murder 
conviction of a minnesota man staying at a home raided by police 
without a court warrant 
in a separate issue involving children several justices voiced 
concern wednesday that societys desire to protect children could 
deny fair trials to people charged with child abuse 
the court heard arguments in cases from maryland and idaho and 
is expected to announce rulings in both by july at issue is 
whether defendants in child abuse cases are entitled to at least 
one facetoface confrontation with their young accusers 
some states use closedcircuit television or permit experts to 
testify for the children 
justice antonin scalia said a court appearance might well be 
something of an emotional trauma for a child but added that 
must be weighed against the years in prison faced by a defendant if 
convicted 
in the child pornography ruling the justices upheld an ohio law 
said to be the toughest of its kind in the nation eighteen other 
states also have laws against possessing such material 
the laws are aimed at stamping out socalled kiddie porn by 
punishing those who buy the material not only those who sell it 
justice william j brennan leading the courts dissenters said 
the ohio law is so vague and so sweeping that it might ban the 
engravings of nude children that adorn our courtroom 
at bottom the court today is so disquieted by the possible 
exploitation of children in the production of the pornography that 
it is willing to tolerate the imposition of criminal penalties for 
simple possession he said 
sexually explicit photos of children may be distasteful he 
said but the constitution guarantees both the right to possess 
them privately and the right to avoid punishment under an 
overbroad law 
a more liberal supreme court invoked free speech and privacy 
rights in 1969 when it barred states from outlawing athome 
possession of obscene materials 
but the court said wednesday that such protection applies only 
to obscenity depicting adults athome possession of sexually 
explicit material depicting children is not protected even if the 
material is not obscene it said 
the justices in 1982 carved out a major exception to freespeech 
rights when they let states outlaw the sale and distribution of 
material depicting children in sexual performances or poses even 
if not obscene 
the court for more than 30 years has allowed states to outlaw 
the sale and distribution of obscene material ruling in a series 
of cases that such material is not constitutionally protected 
justice byron r white writing for the court wednesday said 
ohio legitimately seeks to destroy a market for the exploitative 
use of children by making possession of child pornography a crime 
given the importance of the states interest in protecting the 
victims of child pornography we cannot fault ohio for attempting 
to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain 
he said

a gaping hole in internal revenue service 
procedures could allow millions of taxpayers to claim falsely that 
they applied for an automatic extension of time to file their tax 
returns congressional investigators say 
irs currently has no way of determining whether the extension 
was actually requested the general accounting office said in a 
report to irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr 
the irs estimates that 6 million couples and individuals who 
were unable to meet this weeks deadline for filing incometax 
returns submitted a form 4868 to get an automatic fourmonth 
extension they were required to submit with the form a check for 
estimated taxes owed 
by filing form 4868 taxpayers avoid a failuretofile penalty 
that is 5 percent of tax due for each month or part of a month that 
a return is late the maximum penalty is 25 percent 
in a report on irs policies for forgiving or abating 
penalties the gao found that the tax agency is not nearly so 
forgiving as raw statistics indicate in fact it said 29 percent 
of the abatements of the most common penalties in 1988 were 
necessary to correct irs errors in assessments 
one of the major causes of such errors the report said was 
that in many cases the irs had no record of taxpayers application 
for a delayed filing deadline although many of them later 
produced a copy of the application that they purportedly submitted 
on time 
because the irs has no way of determining whether such a 
taxpayer actually filed for an extension the gao said as a 
matter of policy it records these as assessment errors 
in such cases the failuretofile penalty could be wiped out 
such an adjustment is one of only several types of 
computergenerated changes to taxpayer accounts that the irs 
records as penalty abatements in another example the agency could 
penalize a taxpayer for late payment then discover a credit on the 
taxpayers account that would prompt a reduction in penalty 
these adjustments may overstate the number of abatements by 
almost 80 percent and their dollar value by almost 40 percent 
the gao said 
the study concentrated on the two most common penalties imposed 
by the irs the penalty for failure to pay taxes on time was 
imposed on 84 million taxpayers in 1988 the penalty for failure 
to file a return was imposed 29 million times that year 
the irs reported it forgave 25 million of those 113 million 
penalties or 22 percent however the gao found that 80 percent of 
the abatements actually were computer adjustments worth about 954 
million 
the remaining 500000 abatements worth about 1 billion were 
taxpayerrequested abatements which required irs personnel to make 
a decision regarding whether to reverse or forgive the penalty 
assessment on the basis of information supplied by taxpayers 
the report said 
it said the irs agreed with its recommendation that the 
computergenerated adjustments not be reported as abatements 
irs errors in making penalty assessment and abatement 
decisions can increase taxpayer frustration and generate an 
additional administrative burden for irs the gao said this is 
of particular concern in todays environment of growing taxpayer 
dissatisfaction and limited irs resources 
the irs also agreed with a gao recommendation that tax auditors 
be required to fully document reasons for forgiving penalties gao 
inspectors found that in many cases justifications for abatements 
were inadequate to help in finding and correcting problems in 
processing returns

little brother can play big brother with a toy 
longrange microphone complains a childrens advocacy group that 
says the toy encourages illegal eavesdropping by children 
but the manufacturer of the spy tech longrange microphone 
says theres only a remote possibility the toy could be used 
for eavesdropping 
weve developed a toy line that is totally nonviolent its 
safe its fun and nonviolent said jim alley senior vice 
president for marketing at tyco industries inc the nations 
fifthlargest toymaker 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
said wednesday the group would ask the federal communications 
commission to investigate the toy 
we want them to investigate the legality of selling a 
listening device to children said charren 
act said it also would ask the federal trade commission to 
review print and broadcast advertisements for the microphone 
tycos spytech toy line includes the microphone an 
undercover vest binoculars an intruder alert periscope 
fingerprint kit walkie talkies and a hidden camera the toys each 
sold separately are designed for children 8 years and older 
part of it is just a pretend spy kit said charren 
explaining the group doesnt object to the complete line the 
problem is that the listening device works it is not then a toy 
it is an eavesdropping device 
such criticism is amazing alley said the television 
commercial for the toy does not depict children using any of the 
spy tech toys in any antisocial behavior he said 
the advertisement shows two children using the microphone to 
hone in on the sound of a mans whistling but charren warned it 
could be used for other listening 
that message of listening to somebody when he doesnt know 
youre listening is one anybody can get from the advertisement 
she said 
the company is providing the means and encouragement to young 
children to surreptitiously spy on their unsuspecting playmates 
friends families and neighbors said rudolph brewington a 
privacy advocate and washingtonbased freelance journalist in an 
april 10 letter to tyco president richard grey 
brewington contends the device violates both us criminal law 
and postal regulations that prohibit the manufacture distribution 
or mailing of devices that are primarily useful for the purpose 
of the surreptitious interception of wire or oral communications 
alley said there is little chance the microphone which sells 
for under 20 could be used for eavesdropping 
its a toy its not a hightech listening device he said 
noting it works only in line of sight and not through walls 
windows or doors he also said it could not be concealed because of 
its size and bright red coloring 
the device is small enough to be hidden in a book bag 
countered charren saying it could be used in a schoolroom to 
hear another child being disciplined 
an aide to rep ronald dellums said the device would be illegal 
under a bill proposed by the california democrat 
if a child was listening in on three of its playmates across 
the playground that would be illegal said george withers 
legislative director for the congressmans capitol hill office 
the proposal the privacy assurance act of 1989 would require 
that all participants in a conversation consent to its interception 
by listening or recording devices in instances not involved in law 
enforcement 
the bill which has been referred to the house judiciary 
subcommittee on crime would also require that sound or 
voiceactivated recorders emit an audible beeptone to alert a 
speaker that his communication is being recorded

the usmexican border has become a zone of 
violence because of rockthrowing mexican bandits who prey on 
countrymen trying to enter the united states illegally a former 
us border patrol agent says 
james r dorcy who also worked for the justice departments 
inspector generals office on wednesday defended the patrol 
against allegations of human rights abuses 
he told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on human rights 
and international organizations that some people wanted to believe 
that the border patrol has institutionalized unlawful violence 
and deprivation against aliens 
i come here to tell you that it is not true he said any 
lapses he said are investigated thoroughly 
but the american friends service committee a quaker 
humanitarian organization released a report in which it said it 
documented 380 cases of alleged human rights violations against 
aliens between may 1988 and may 1989 
they occurred near san diego rio grande texas tucson ariz 
el paso texas and florida 
the violations involved physical abuse denial of constitutional 
rights arrest shooting seizure of property and verbal abuse 
said maria jimenez director of the committees immigration law 
enforcement monitoring project 
particularly alarming is the increasing use of deadly force in 
border policing which in at least one instance in each of the four 
southern border areas have led to death or serious injury she 
said 
agents have used guns and cars to run down aliens trying to 
flee she said 
in one case luis eduardo hernandez 14 was run over and killed 
by a border patrol vehicle just a few feet from the border as he 
attempted to run back into mexico through the fence in august 1989 
said roberto martinez who works with jimenez 
but dorcy said the agents are the ones at risk 
the rockthrowing incidents that our border patrol agents 
daily face are perpetuated by none other than members of the 
criminal element at the border who also prey on their own 
countrymen trying to cross the border illegally he said 
steven garcia who represents the border patrol agents 
bargaining unit said the patrol is understaffed and often harassed 
by those desperate to cross the border 
hostile crowds of people hurl rocks bottles and insults at 
border patrol agents who venture close to the border he said 
moreover he said the border patrol is understaffed and unable 
to handle the thousands of people who want to get into the united 
states a single agent may handle as many as 40 people at one time 
he said 
rep jim bates dcalif said the situation is deteriorating 
i wish i could say that violent confrontations between 
americans and undocumented immigrants are isolated but 
unfortunately they are not he said

a new economic analysis by the agriculture 
department says this years wheat harvest could increase sharply if 
current prospects hold up 
the wheat inventory on march 1 was the smallest in 15 years and 
could be down to 442 million bushels by the start of the new 
marketing year june 1 according to usda estimates that would be 
the smallest june 1 wheat reserve since 1975 
analysts said wednesday that despite the tight supply situation 
1990 wheat prices through midmarch dropped about 10 percent 
reflecting prospects for a larger harvest this year 
winter wheat acreage seeded last fall was up nearly 4 percent 
from a year earlier and 71 percent of the crop was reported in 
good or excellent condition as of midapril the report said 
farmers who normally plant spring wheat indicated in a survey 
announced by usda on march 30 that they intend to reduce their 
acreage this year 
as a result the new report said the total wheat acreage may be 
up only 12 percent from last year 
but some of last years wheat area was counted twice because 
farmers reseeded damaged winter wheat acreage with spring wheat 
the report said thus this years area increase is understated 
additionally the report said winter wheat states say that 
this seasons winterkill has been lower so harvested area may 
post larger gains than planted area 
the larger harvested acreage assuming peracre yields recover 
points to a 1990 us wheat crop substantially larger than last 
years 204 billion bushels production dropped to about 18 
billion bushels in 1988 largely reflecting drought losses 
wheat market prices in the 198990 marketing year that soon will 
end are forecast by usda to average in the range of 370 to 375 
per bushel compared with 372 in 198889 and 257 in 198788

a government index that measures drought 
severity over the long haul shows that much of the midwest and 
great plains has recovered from the moisture deficits of the late 
1980s 
the socalled palmer index used by the national weather service 
shows huge areas of moist conditions east of the rocky mountains 
and relatively small areas of severe and extreme drought remaining 
in north dakota and adjacent parts of south dakota minnesota iowa 
and nebraska and the southern part of florida 
most of the west however is still gripped by severe and 
extreme longterm drought 
according to the agency the index depicts prolonged abnormal 
dryness or wetness over periods of months and years the index 
changes little from week to week and reflects the longterm runoff 
recharge and deep percolation of moisture into the subsoil 
the index was used in a weekly report by the governments joint 
agricultural weather facility operated by the agriculture and 
commerce departments 
weather analysts said the overall indications from the index and 
state reports are that moisture supplies are abundant in the 
central and eastern corn belt adequate to short in the western 
corn belt and mostly short in the spring wheat region 
in ohio and indiana for example topsoil moisture was reported 
to be 48 percent and 65 percent in surplus respectively the cold 
wet soils have limited fieldwork in indiana and caused 
unhealthylooking stands of wheat and oats in ohio 
conditions improve to the west with about onefifth of 
illinois topsoils rated either short or surplus and 28 percent of 
iowa rated short and 72 percent adequate the report said this 
contrasts favorably with the situation 12 months ago when topsoils 
rated 81 percent short in iowa and 44 percent short in illinois 
but the report said subsoil moisture remains surprisingly low 
in the western corn belt with iowa reporting 76 percent short and 
nebraska 88 percent short 
th report showed that it would take up to seven inches of 
additional precipitation to restore subsoil moisture reserves 
although most parched areas of the northern plains would need less 
than that 
for north dakota the nations most important spring wheat 
state all indicators show that drought remains a concern the 
report said a dry march following the driest winter on record 
did nothing to remove the lingering effects of the 1988 drought 
although north dakota is most affected right now surrounding 
states also are of concern and the area clearly bears close 
watching in coming weeks the report said

discount stores would find it easier to sue 
manufacturers who refuse to sell to them at the behest of 
highprice retailers under a bill approved by the house 
challenging the threat of a veto by president bush the house 
voted 235157 wednesday for legislation restoring discounters 
ability to win jury trials for suits alleging that their 
competitors and manufacturers conspired to keep retail prices from 
falling below a fixed level 
consumers must now buy highbrow fashions at ritzyglitzy 
prices because highbrow and ritzyglitzy suppliers can discuss 
price ranges and still be exempt from antitrust laws said rep 
lawrence j smith dfla 
and they can shut out rockbottom discounters who want to sell 
the same thing to a consumer at a lower price 
the legislation was introduced following the justice 
departments refusal to pursue any vertical pricefixing cases 
under the nations antitrust laws since 1981 when republicans 
assumed control of the white house 
compounding the problem according to consumers groups were 
supreme court decisions in 1984 and 1988 that dismissed private 
suits because discounters had not shown that their supplies were 
cut off because they were charging prices below those suggested by 
a manufacturer 
the legislation was supported by 42 of the nations 50 state 
attorneys general who contend that such price collusion often is 
done with a nod and without a paper trail of written formal 
agreements 
the result according to consumers union is that larger dealers 
are coercing manufacturers to terminate contracts with rival 
discounters and various brand names are disappearing from the 
shelves of discount stores 
kristin rand a lawyer for the consumer group cited a suit 
dismissed by a federal judge in new york in january in which kids 
r us a nationwide discounter of childrens clothing accused 
macys of pressuring two manufacturers of childrens swimwear to 
stop supplying it 
although the judge found evidence of coercion on the part of 
macys she said there was no automatic presumption of an 
antitrust violation because there was no agreement on a specific 
price or price level 
price fixing is now proliferating because of the lax 
enforcement of our antitrust laws said the bills chief sponsor 
rep jack brooks dtexas 
brooks chairman of the house judiciary committee has estimated 
that consumers are paying an extra 20 billion as a result of a 
combination of the court rulings and the reluctance of the justice 
department to pursue antitrust violations 
democrats beat back three republican amendments to weaken the 
bill however on a voice vote the house did approve an amendment 
by rep carlos moorhead rcalif to not apply the new evidentiary 
standards retroactively 
similar legislation has been approved by senate judiciary 
committee although republican sens strom thurmond of south 
carolina and orrin hatch of utah have threatened to mount a 
filibuster if its brought to the senate floor 
attorney general dick thornburgh and the white house office of 
management and budget have said they would recommend that bush veto 
the bill 
omb said in a statement of administration policy that the bill 
would interfere with manufacturers rights to determine who will 
distribute their products and expressed fears that juries would 
misinterpret lawful business decisions as pricefixing 
conspiracies

the bush administration is determined to stop 
congress from imposing economic sanctions on iraq although it is 
worried about alleged iraqi attempts to build a nuclear and 
chemical weapons arsenal 
some us officials also oppose a proposed congressional 
resolution condemning iraqs consistent pattern of human rights 
violations said a congressional source who asked not to be 
identified 
the nonbinding resolution faced a vote today in the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on human rights it cites among other 
violations iraqs use of chemical weapons against its kurdish 
minority in 1988 and persistent repression of all political 
opposition 
the administration is mainly concerned however with draft 
legislation being sponsored by rep howard berman dcalif that 
would ban all us aid to iraq 
the administration is particularly opposed to a provision in the 
draft bill that would ban credits and loans by the governments 
exportimport bank for iraqi agriculture said edward gnehm deputy 
assistant secretary of state in charge of persian gulf affairs 
gnehm speaking at a seminar on wednesday said the 
administrations policy on sanctions is to oppose them and he 
added our objective will be to see that it the bill doesnt 
pass 
iraq he said is an important country with an important role 
to play in the region we hope this role will be a constructive 
one 
the administration believes that sanctions would antagonize 
iraqi president saddam hussein and reduce us influence over his 
policies 
iraq has the worlds secondlargest proven oil reserves and 
us dependence on imported oil from the persian gulf region is 
growing iraq also has the regions biggest military force 
battletried during its nineyear war with iran 
but ties with the united states have been strained in recent 
weeks over a series of disclosures about iraqi actions 
gnehm cited a warning by saddam that his country would use 
chemical weapons against israel if attacked which he called 
inflammatory last months exposure of an iraqi ring allegedly 
trying to smuggle nuclear triggers for atomic bombs and an alleged 
plot by an iraqi diplomat at the united nations to kill two 
political opponents 
recent iraqi actions have raised serious questions in our mind 
about iraqi intentions he said iraq cannot flout our laws and 
act in ways which call its international commitments into question 
with impunity 
he urged the iraqi government to take early action to allay 
the concerns we have about its recent behavior 
although saddam has denied he intends to develop nuclear arms 
gnehm said iraq continues to try and develop nuclear chemical and 
biological weapons

in testimony wednesday to the house appropriations subcommittee 
on transportation representatives of the general accounting office 
cited fundamental weaknesses in the procurement process 
those weaknesses have resulted in expensive inadequately 
justified procurements continued delays in the development and 
delivery of important elements of air traffic control modernization 
and increased risk that some air traffic control systems will be 
stressed beyond their capacities a gao report said 
it recommended that the transportation department reevaluate 
the 17 billion mode s transponder program in the overhaul plan 
and consider all alternatives including terminating the 
contract in whole or in part 
and it said the federal aviation administration an agency of 
the transportation department should cancel its 15 billion 
computer resources nucleus project which is largely unrelated to 
the air traffic overhaul 
a transponder is a device used to signal an airplanes identity 
to a traffic control radar the mode s makes it possible to 
read an airplanes altitude in addition to its location the 
first fully capable mode s system out of 396 the faa plans to 
purchase wont be delivered until april 1993 five years late the 
gao said 
it said the program also is mired in contract disputes 
additionally the gao said there have been delays in shipping 
critical parts for the 5 billion advanced automation system for 
air traffic control this increases the burden on terminal radar 
approach control facilities or tracons a critical element in 
maintaining the safe separation of aircraft gao said 
the transponder system and the automation system are part of the 
national airspace plan the governments blueprint since 1981 for 
modernizing the air transportation network it was originally 
estimated to take 10 years and cost nearly 12 billion 
critics say the technology for the program has become obsolete 
while delays and new projects have added to its completion date and 
overall cost 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn said the agency was studying the 
gaos recommendations and would prepare a response that would be 
part of a formal report 
the agency has defended its program elsewhere blaming problems 
on the unprecedented growth in air traffic 
the national airspace system plan will develop the technology 
and expertise that american companies will sell all over the 
world transportation secretary samuel skinner said in a speech 
earlier this year 
the faa is requesting 25 billion for fiscal 1991 for the plan 
that represents a 45 percent increase over the previous years 
funding

the bush administration which is pushing 
japan to lower its barriers to the sale of american and other 
foreign goods is launching talks on another product amorphous 
metals 
us trade representative carla hills said wednesday the united 
states and japan have agreed to negotiate in an effort to resolve 
allegations of unfair trade practices being brought by a new 
jerseybased company allied signal inc 
hills said that while negotiations are under way she will delay 
action for five months on a petition the company filed seeking 
economic retaliation against japan 
the dispute because it involves a hightechnology product with 
the potential for big sales is considered a major test case in the 
administrations new efforts to break down trade barriers in japan 
allied signal headquartered in morristown nj filed its 
petition with hills office on march 5 alleging that it has been 
unfairly blocked from selling its invention in japan for more than 
a decade marketed under the name metglas the product is used in 
electric transformers where it cuts energy transmission losses 
the company contends that the potential worldwide market for the 
product is 1 billion annually and that it has been barred from 
japan because the japanese government wanted to foster development 
of a rival amorphous metal product 
in announcing her decision hills said she would expedite review 
of a new petition from allied signal seeking retaliation if the 
talks over the next 150 days fail to resolve the dispute 
allied signal chairman edward l hennessy jr said he accepted 
the administrations decision to negotiate in light of recent 
actions by japan to lower barriers to foreign products 
the recently announced progress in the trade talks between the 
united states and japan holds out the promise that trade issues 
between the two nations can be resolved in a more businesslike and 
less confrontational manner he said in a statement 
sen john danforth a leading congressional critic of japan 
said the administration would have to be dogged in its pursuit 
of a successful resolution of the dispute 
the bottom line has to be results in the form of export sales 
for a us firm that is being shut out by japan danforth rmo 
said in statement

in the harsh world of the louisiana state 
penitentiary wilbert rideau can do pretty much what he wants 
except get out 
in prison for murdering a woman by slitting her throat and 
stabbing her in the heart he has become a prizewinning journalist 
in his 29 years behind bars 
but his high profile has led authorities to keep him locked up 
says rideau who claims hed be a free man if he had spent his time 
making license plates instead 
ive tried to make amends the best i could in the only ways 
available to me ive done things that counted over the last 29 
years rideau said in a telephone interview wednesday that was 
the only violent act of my life done when i was a wild teenager 
if i could change it i would 
on wednesday the louisiana pardon board recommended for the 
fourth time in six years that rideau be set free gov buddy 
roemer said he is inclined to reject the unanimous recommendation 
to commute rideaus life sentence 
rideau is serving time for the 1961 murder of bank teller julia 
ferguson during a robbery in the southwest louisiana town of lake 
charles then 19 he got away with 14279 stuffed in a suitcase 
wielding his pistol he forced two tellers and the branch manager 
into a car 
he drove them to a deserted road and shot all three when mrs 
ferguson begged for her life rideau killed her the two others 
survived 
rideau 48 who fancies designer jeans and cowboy boots as his 
prison gear has been called a model inmate by prison officials 
the editor of the prison magazine the angolite he also gives 
lectures to youth groups and gets out to go on national speaking 
tours on prison reform over the years rideau who works out of 
the magazine office has had a literary agent and written 
freelance articles for up to four figures for publications such as 
penthouse 
rideau has won the robert f kennedy journalism award the 
american bar associations silver gavel award and the george polk 
award for special interest reporting 
the polk award came on two articles in the angolite prison a 
sexual jungle dealing with homosexual rape and the other side 
of murder which told of the aftermath of a killing 
the angolite which has carried stories on inmate suicides 
prison riots prisoner rights executions prison sports and 
special events was featured in the new york times sunday magazine

columbia journalism review 
rideau has appeared on national tv including abcs 
nightline on which he was on a fiveman panel with former 
chief justice warren e burger in a discussion of prison reform 
and that is why rideau thinks hes still in prison 
lets face it theyve released thousands of murderers since 
ive been in prison ive watched them come in and go out all 
anonymous he said 
the governor hasnt searched out the families of their victims 
to talk to theyve managed to get out because their greatest 
achievement as a prisoner was that they remained anonymous 
of the 31 prisoners sentenced to either death or life in prison 
sent to louisiana state penitentiary in 1962 only rideau remains 
behind bars 
its not like im asking for special treatment or 
consideration not when the system has released everybody else 
routinely convicted of the same or worse crimes the system exists 
for everybody else in the state but wilbert rideau he said 
wednesday was the seventh time rideau has applied for clemency 
he initially was sentenced to death but that was commuted to life 
in 1973 when the us supreme court overturned the death penalty 
he must wait one year to reapply 
ill try again next year he said what choice do i have 
i cant sit down and talk to the governor so the only hope i have 
is to go to the pardon board

a twoday conference on global warming brought 
to the surface the polarization between much of europe and the 
united states over the question of global warming and the need for 
action 
the conference produced little to indicate the bush 
administration will abandon its goslow cautious policy and adopt 
the more aggressive posture held by many of the european countries 
president bush in closing the international conference 
wednesday declared his commitment to action to sound analysis 
and sound policies in tackling the problem of manmade pollution 
that scientists say is causing a warming of the earth 
the climate change debate is not about research versus 
action for we have never considered research a substitute for 
action he told the delegates from 18 nations 
but neither bush nor other senior administration officials 
suggested that the administration is prepared to embrace the 
aggressive response strategies discussed by some european delegates 
no one at the white house discussed possible timetables for 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions allan bromley the presidents 
science adviser and cochairman of the conference repeatedly 
emphasized the session was aimed at dealing with unresolved 
scientific issues and economics not response or policy issues 
the president did not mention action plans when he welcomed the 
delegates on tuesday prompting criticism from the european 
delegations environmentalists contended bush allowed the 
leadership mantle to fall into european hands on the global warming 
issue 
worldwide action is urgently needed even if all the complex 
scientific causal relationships of climate changes have not been 
firmly established klaus topfer the west german environment 
minister told the delegates 
the europeans argue enough already is known to launch prudent 
plans for cutting carbon dioxide which comes largely from the 
burning of fossil fuels and accounts for half of the global warming 
problem 
the dutch favor a commitment as soon as possible by the 
industrial countries to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions by the 
year 2000 the european community may well make such a commitment 
without us participation this summer 
west germany informed the delegates it plans to draft a proposal 
for a 25 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions in germany by the 
year 2005 the canadians also said they plan to develop carbon 
dioxide reduction goals 
the bush administration however has made no indication it will 
join soon in taking similar actions suggesting instead that the 
global warming threat and the economic impact must still be better 
understood 
european delegates scoffed at those statements 
a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions is not a matter of 
economic constraints but it is a matter of political will hans 
alders the dutch environmental minister told the delegates 
within the bush administration there appears to be no similar 
sense of urgency asked about a timetable energy secretary james 
watkins suggested in an interview that a plan for specific carbon 
dioxide controls might not be prudent until the middle of the 
decade 
epa administrator william reilly suggested it could be 
considerably sooner he said the united states still hopes to join 
negotiations late this year or early in 1991 on developing a 
framework that would eventually be the basis for an international 
treaty to cut global warming pollutants 
meanwhile the white house tried to put its own spin on the 
global warming issue during the conference according to an 
internal document that found its way to environmental activists 
who provided it to reporters 
the guidelines presumably for administration officials 
attending the conference included a section on debates to 
avoid it wasnt clear who drew up the talking points 
although administration officials said they were authentic 
the document warned against discussions of whether there is too 
much warming of the earth because in the eyes of the public we 
will lose this debate 
other things not to do according to the white house guidelines 
dont get into an advocacy position of the merits of the 
various policy proposals 
dont use specific numbers degrees dollars rates etc 
when discussing how the conference is accelerating the 
international discussion and understanding of these issues 
finally dont let reporters position this conference as an 
attempt to delay serious decisions on this issue 
william reilly head of the environmental protection agency and 
one of the administrations leading spokesmen on global warming 
issues said he was aware of the document but that he frequently 
talks about many of the subjects outlined in the dont section

even the safety and health hazards at the top 
of 1986 fixup lists for the governments nuclear weapons plants 
hadnt been fixed at the beginning of 1990 says a report to 
congress 
as of january the government and its contractors had taken care 
of just 41 percent of the highest priority problems in the weapons 
complex and overall had resolved just 34 percent of the health and 
safety problems identified since 1986 the general accounting 
office said 
it is shocking that nuclear hazards requiring immediate 
attention got no attention at all said sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio who released the report wednesday with rep george miller 
dcalif 
our work raises questions about the energy departments 
commitment to resolving its problems in a timely manner said the 
report by the gao congress investigative arm 
the department refused to comment on the report before officials 
got a chance to review it however the reports authors got their 
data from the departments computers and discussed the data with 
doe officials 
it would seem to us unlikely that it would reveal anything we 
werent already aware of doe spokesman robert griffin said 
certainly admiral watkins secretary james d watkins is aware 
of the magnitude of the environmental problems faced by the 
department 
according to the report the energy department has logged 113 
radiation and other problems that posed a clear and present 
danger to workers or the public 
there were 36 such problems at the rocky flats plant in 
colorado of which 23 were resolved 33 at savannah river sc of 
which one was resolved 30 at the y12 plant in tennessee of which 
12 were resolved 14 at the lawrence livermore laboratory in 
california of which 10 were resolved 
when all types of safety and health problems were added up the 
hanford nuclear reservation in washington state had the largest 
total 294 of which 89 had been taken care of rocky flats total 
was 262 with 142 problems resolved and the feed material 
production center at fernald ohio was ranked third with 186 
problems 46 of which were resolved 
data on environmental hazards showed fernald had more problems 
than any other plant 68 in all among the other major plants 
savannah river and lawrence livermore were second with 65 
environmental problems los alamos nm and idaho lab each had 
59 hanford and y12 each had 58 pantex in amarillo texas had 
56 and portsmouth ohio had 55 
at 31 energy departmentowned nuclear weapons plants and 
research laboratories 1277 environmental problems were logged 
including 44 radioactive contamination problems the report said 
all of these problems are considered by doe to be 
unresolved it said 
the department told the gao none of those 1277 problems pose an 
immediate health threat however 192 of those problems involve a 
high risk for a threat to health and fernald had 31 problems in 
that category more than any other plant 
the government has acknowledged the environmental problems at 
the plants but the report criticized the slow pace at which it has 
drawn up plans to fix the problems nine plants dont have such 
plans and where the plans have been completed they were on 
average six months late 
we know the problems are complex but that is no excuse for 
does failure even to come with plans to clean up the hundreds of 
nuclear hazards metzenbaum said in a statement

easy listening music can do more 
to put people on edge than silence can researchers say 
music fans eager to relax should simply reach for the type of 
music they already enjoy the researchers said 
some people dont relax to certain types of music because they 
dont like it said valerie stratton a penn state university 
assistant professor of psychology 
the subject might even become more tense than without music 
said annette zalanowski an assistant professor of music 
the pair exposed dozens of people to a variety of music and 
polled them on how relaxed they felt during each piece 
atonal music from 20th century composers and nonwestern music 
billed as relaxing fared the worst stratton said rock n roll 
wasnt used because lyrics could skew a persons true response to 
the music she said 
music from india was panned because the 84 collegeage people 
tested were unaccustomed to it the researchers said 
no single type of music was most effective in aiding 
relaxation and no significant differences were found between 
soothing and stimulating music the researchers said

west german industry is urging us companies 
to join in a morethemerrier spirit and invest in east germany and 
elsewhere in eastern europe 
there are vast opportunities for western business ludolf 
von wartenberg president of the federation of german industries 
bdi said wednesday in a speech to the american institute for 
contemporary german studies 
von wartenberg said west german subsidiaries of american 
companies like ford general moters and ibm are actively looking 
for investment opportunities like major west german and other west 
europeanowned firms but he said he came to the united states in 
part to encourage us companies without a foothold in europe to 
join in 
japan is very interested he said noting that it has set up 
an office in berlin and is looking to move into east germany 
von wartenberg acknowledged that west german companies have a 
competitive advantage but said he expected 30 percent of firms in 
east germany eventually would be foreignowned the same percentage 
as in west germany 
enormous investments are necessary in infrastructure above 
all telecommunications where the current standards are deplorable 
but also roads railroads the vast area of financial and 
consulting services and to some extent tourism 
east german industry will have to undergo a drastic 
transformation because it is so inefficient and polluting he said 
many plants will have to be rebuilt from the ground up and the 
workforce will have to become much more productive

several universities are telling the pentagon 
a military policy barring homosexuals from service is generating 
pressure to oust rotc from their campuses 
the contradiction between the universitys principle of 
nondiscrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual 
orientation and the presence of an rotc that does discriminate 
cannot exist on the campuses indefinitely john m deutch 
provost of the massachusetts institute of technology said in a 
letter to defense secretary dick cheney 
many universities will withdraw from the rotc program 
deutch wrote 
the department of defense has declined to comment on the campus 
challenges on grounds the homosexual ban is being challenged in 
court 
the department has limited responses to a written statement 
outlining its grounds for barring homosexuals that homosexuality 
is incompatible with military service because of the close quarters 
in which people of the same sex must live and because of the 
security risk posed by the possibility of a homosexual officer 
being blackmailed 
top administrators faculty groups and students from mit the 
university of wisconsin university of minnesota northwestern 
university and others have actively campaigned against the reserve 
officer training corps policy 
no rotc program has been removed from a campus as a result of

an electrically powered car in recognition of consumer demand for a 
cleaner environment says gm chairman roger b smith 
the nations largest automaker intends to be the first to 
massmarket the vehicle smith said in a speech wednesday to the 
national press club gm unveiled a prototype vehicle the impact 
in january 
he refused to say when or where the car would be built or to 
reveal technical information about the vehicle saying he did not 
want to tip off competitors in the 1970s gm announced it would 
produce a 1985model electric car but it dropped that project long 
before production 
smith said the goal is to manufacture a car that would match 
todays safety and performance standards without the air pollution 
of an internal combustion engine generation of the electricity of 
course would create other pollution if fossil fuels were used in 
the power plant 
we have set an aggressive schedule for ourselves in order to 
pull along the technological developments that we still need 
smith said 
still needed is a better battery and smith said that may 
require joint development by automakers utilities battery 
manufacturers and the federal government 
though obstacles remain when we look at the strict cleanair 
legislation thats now being proposed for many areas of the

translated from arabic into english by the associated press 
the organization of islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine persists in the struggle to accomplish its sacred 
objectives 
in order to achieve the aims for which the hostages have been 
held and since the issue of the hostages has been set at a 
positive course toward the useful solution for all sides and after 
the consensus among people with foresight and those concerned in 
this crisis that convincing and meaningful formulas should be 
reached the organization of islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine announces the following

leaders and in response to the emphatic behest of the officials of 
the islamic republic of iran to initiate a goodwill gesture to 
begin closing this case and without forgetting the constant syrian

forward by releasing an american hostage within 48 hours on the 
basis of reciprocal move to accomplish what is required to 
accelarate the happy ending 
second we want the humanitarian move to be balanced between 
both sides this is a condition to move forward otherwise there is

behests hoping to reach a solution as proposed and on the basis of 
the verbal message that will be conveyed to president bush we are 
ready to reciprocate or escalate the other side has to choose

a supreme court ruling allowing judges 
to order schools to raise taxes for desegregation wouldnt have 
come about if lawmakers and the public had met their 
responsibility says the head of kansas citys schools 
the high court ruled 90 wednesday that judges cannot directly 
impose a tax increase as us district judge russell clark did in 
the kansas city case in 1987 but in a 54 vote it upheld a federal 
appeals court decision that clark could instead order the school 
board to raise taxes 
julia hill newly elected school board president said the issue 
wouldnt have even been before the court if voters hadnt turned 
down school tax increases time and again 
i would have loved for the previous tax levies to pass when 
they were presented to the public sometimes three times she 
said at a news conference 
when democracy fails sometimes people have to pay and 
democracy failed here in kansas city and it also failed at the 
state level 
all of this could have been alleviated by changing some 
boundary lines 20 years ago but nobody did anything so were at a 
state now where were under a federal court order 
before 1954 missouri law required schools to be racially 
segregated in the following 35 years the percentage of black 
students in kansas citys school district rose from 225 percent to 
about 75 percent 
black parents sued in 1977 over the decline of what had become 
predominantly black schools alleging black students were being 
denied equal educational opportunities 
clark ruled in 1987 that the schools have literally rotted 
and ordered state and district officials to upgrade them he 
ordered the state to pay threefourths of the remedial costs and 
the school district the rest 
district voters had rejected six proposals since 1970 to raise 
taxes for education 
clark had nearly doubled the local property tax from 205 to 4

the peep shows and xrated theaters of times 
square will give way to four new office towers now that the state 
has won the right to demolish 34 buildings in a longdelayed 25 
billion renewal project 
state and city officials hope that replacing the sex shops and 
other rundown buildings will revitalze the area and rout the 
prostitutes drug pushers and muggers that give times square its 
seedy reputation 
state supreme court justice stanley j parness signed an order 
wednesday giving the state urban development corp title to the 34 
properties 
the project first approved in 1984 is the nations largest 
urban redevelopment project 
after seven years after 48 lawsuits we are finally taking 
possession of the property said state director of economic 
development vincent tese we now own it 
the tenants will be moved out and demolition could begin as 
early as summer he said 
critics charge that the towers are too big the tax abatements 
granted to builders too large and the real estate market too soft 
to warrant the new office space 
but backers say the project will create 16000 construction jobs 
and 20000 permanent jobs when the towers are completed in four 
years 
the buildings will be glitzed up with neon signs lights and 
mirrors to preserve the areas character the developers also plan 
to renovate the dilapidated times square subway station and nine 
theaters 
the idea is to discourage drug dealers muggers con artists and 
prostitutes in an area where 2246 felonies were reported on 42nd 
street between broadway and eighth avenue in 1988 
this is a milestone for the economy of new york gov mario 
cuomo said it will make 42nd street a safe productive part of 
the citys entertainment district 
the projects developers prudential insurance co and park 
tower realty have put up 241 million to compensate the landowners 
gary rosenberg lawyer for the durst organization which filed 
three lawsuits against the project said his organization had 30 
days to decide whether to appeal the condemnation order 
in the last year durst acquired 70year leaseholds for eight 
theaters despite the threat of condemnation it is renovating the 
theaters and has spent more than 3 million so far to repair roofs 
and facades 
a hotel and merchandise mart are also on the drawing board tese 
said wednesdays decision also should spur action on those plans

women who sought to have baby girls have been 
impregnated with female embryos selected from a test tube 
scientists reported today 
the results obtained by way of a new embryoscreening procedure 
designed to prevent genetic diseases are the first reported 
pregnancies using embryos tested to reveal gender researchers said 
in the british journal nature 
two of three pregnant women expect twins this summer study 
coauthor alan handyside said in a telephone interview the third 
expects one child he said 
the laboratory test identified the sex of the microscopic 
embryos only three days after fertilization he said 
the women were at risk of transmitting serious genetic diseases 
to a male child handyside said the test also could be used 
without a medical justification to select the sex of a child but 
handyside said he would consider that unethical 
further research might provide a way to screen out embryos that 
would develop serious genetic diseases thereby removing the 
prospect of abortions in those cases researchers said 
the work was reported by handyside and colleagues at the royal 
postgraduate medical school at hammsmith hospital in london 
lab techniques have been used before to determine a babys sex 
in 1986 a new orleans fertility institute announced the birth of a 
boy whose sex had been selected during in vitro fertilization 
which is done in the laboratory that case involved selecting sperm 
to produce a boy 
but sperm selection has not proved reliable said dr maria 
bustillo of the genetics and ivf institute in fairfax va and it 
does not hold the promise of diagnosing genetic diseases before an 
embryo is implanted as embryo analysis does she said wednesday 
it is not clear how many couples would choose the embryo 
analysis which requires in vitro fertilization rather than 
conceiving naturally and then considering an abortion after 
undergoing a standard genetic analysis of the fetus she said 
but it may be possible someday to allow a woman to conceive 
naturally and then flush out the embryo for analysis she said 
then reimplant it if desired 
some 200 genetic diseases that typically affect only boys have 
been identified including the most severe form of muscular 
dystrophy hemophilia and a form of mental retardation handyside 
said 
the embryo analysis involves collecting eggs from a woman 
fertilizing them in a test tube and letting them grow to eightcell 
embryos a single cell is removed from each embryo to see if it 
contains a bit of genetic material that indicates the presence of a 
y chromosome which would mean the embryo is destined to become a 
boy 
the three pregnant women were each given two embryos to increase 
the chance of pregnancy handyside said 
for families that risk passing on serious genetic disease to 
males the embryo procedure should be less emotionally trying than 
an abortion said pediatrician and ethicist dr kathleen nolan at 
the hastings center in briarcliff manor ny 
she and ethicist arthur caplan at the university of minnesota 
said the technique is probably too cumbersome and costly to make it 
widely popular for choosing a babys sex without any medical reason 
but they said thorny issues could arise if researchers find an 
easier way to analyze genetic traits of an embryo and learn to 
predict a variety of diseases and personal traits 
many people would oppose using embryo analysis to pick a childs 
hair color or sex for no medical reason just as many would support 
use of the technique if the embryo were certain to develop a 
serious disease nolan said 
but between those two extremes lies a huge gray zone in 
terms of how to decide an embryo isnt good enough for 
implantation she said 
some might consider it socially very undesirable for a woman 
to take a 50 percent chance of having a child who is going to be 
obese since those children are likely to get into more medical 
problems and cost the society she said

prices on the tokyo stock exchange soared thursday 
while the dollar closed sharply lower against the yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which rose 78746 points on 
wednesday added another 69635 points or 238 percent to end the 
day at 2994541 
the dollar closed at 15775 yen down 212 yen from wednesdays 
close of 15987 yen the currency opened at 15835 yen and ranged 
between 15760 yen and 15850 yen 
traders attributed the nikkei indexs surge largely to the yens 
strength against the dollar 
inspired by the yens recovery market players started buying 
issues to which they have been paying little attention said a 
trader with yamaichi securities co speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
he said the market appears to have entered a rising phase after 
a series of plunges earlier this year 
currency dealers said the dollars slide followed its downswing 
in new york wednesday despite a report of a sharp improvement in 
the us merchandise trade figures for february 
japanese investors had bought the dollar earlier expecting the 
improvement in the us trade deficit and they started selling the 
dollar before the figure actually came out yesterday said minori 
takeuchi a dealer with chemical bank in tokyo 
the trade deficit narrowed to 649 billion in february its 
lowest level in six years from a revised 932 billion in january 
largely because of a sharp drop in oil imports past improvements 
in the trade deficit have usually helped the dollar but some 
analysts suggested that the latest improvement may not last 
many market players are still doubtful that the decrease in 
the us deficit will continue ms takeuchi said 
she said investors are trying to test the dollars bottom and 
added the dollar will slide as low as 157 yen 
the price of the benchmark no 119 10year japanese government 
bond was quoted at 8626 points up from wednesdays close of 
8614 that dropped the yield to 731 percent from 7335 percent

heres a look at what is at stake economically for 
lithuania and the soviet union if the baltic republic is isolated 
 
in the soviet economic arsenal 
lithuania receives all of its oil gas and diesel fuel from 
the soviet union paying subsidized prices at world market prices 
lithuania would run a deficit of 700 million for oil alone 
it also receives all of its metals cotton tractors and 
automobiles from the soviet union 
it receives 58 percent of its sugar from cuba via the soviet 
union 
it receives 37 percent of its concentrated fertilizer from the 
soviet union cotton 100 percent 
it received 400000 tons of grain from the soviets in 1989 
it has only four to five days supply of newsprint and the 
soviets could cut off the supply thus shutting down its newspapers 
 
in lithuanias economic arsenal 
the republic sends to the soviet union 15 percent of the 
nations total production including household electrical meters 
100 percent television set components 70 percent and tractor 
components 30 percent 
it produces much more meat 530000 metric tons in 1987 eggs 
12 million metric tons in 1987 milk 31 million metric tons in 
1987 and other dairy products than it consumes so it could cut 
off the rest of the soviet union from its surplus 
textile products are shipped to factories in the soviet union 
including one plant in leningrad that employs 18000 workers 
the shutdown of the pipeline to the mazeikiai refinery also 
means a curtailment of supplies to the republics of estonia latvia 
and byelorussia a shutdown of a natural gas pipeline would 
interrupt the flow of gas to kaliningrad part of the russian 
republic west of lithuania 
lithuania could demand world prices for exporting soviet 
products through its baltic ports including klaipeda

eight more sheriffs officers have been 
suspended in an internal investigation into skimming of drug money 
in the departments narcotics bureau bringing to 27 the number 
relieved of duty 
the seven deputies and one sergeant suspended wednesday were 
summoned to city hall in suburban santa fe springs relieved of 
their weapons and badges and questioned the department said they 
were suspended with pay 
they joined 18 other officers from the narcotics bureau and 
another officer outside the unit who have been suspended in the 
18monthold probe 
sheriff sherman block declined to elaborate on why the eight 
were suspended but the inquiry has focused on allegations officers 
skimmed money seized from suspected drug dealers 
ten deputies suspended earlier and one of their wives were 
indicted on charges of stealing more than 14 million and using it 
to buy cars homes and stocks 
although we are saddened by the necessity for this action the 
more than 11000 honest and hard working men and women of the 
sheriffs department will continue as they have to do their jobs 
within integrity said sheriff block who is up for reelection 
this year 
about two years ago the narcotics bureau had 120 deputies and 
sergeants current numbers were not released 
the inquiry has hurt at least a dozen drug prosecutions most 
recently a convicted dealer serving a fiveyear sentence was freed 
from prison in december after the judge learned sheriffs 
investigators may have falsified evidence 
prosecutors said deputies may have lied about the circumstances 
that led to a search of trosper paries apartment and discovery of 
more than 11 pounds of cocaine

the exclusive province of mexican authorities to fight narcotics 
trafficking in all its forms within its own territory the 
government said in a statement 
if it is proved that the suspect was kidnapped and illegally 
taken to the united states by authorities of that country it

the dollar took a nosedive against the japanese yen 
today contributing to a surge on the tokyo stock exchanges chief 
index as market players actively bought issues 
the dollar closed at 15775 yen down 212 yen from wednesdays 
close at 15987 yen the currency opened at 15835 yen and ranged 
between 15760 yen and 15850 yen 
the amount of decline in the dollar today was the largest since 
aug 1 when it lost 245 yen overnight to 13665 yen 
dealers said the dollars slide in tokyo followed its overnight 
downswing in new york despite a report wednesday of a sharp 
improvement in the us merchandise trade figures for february 
japanese investors had bought the dollar earlier based on 
their expectation that the us trade deficit would largely 
improve and then they dumped the currency when the figure actually 
came out said mitsuhiko kinugasa a dealer with daiwa bank 
he said the market did not react to wednesdays us trade 
report because it had already taken into account the expected 
decline in the trade deficit 
in an attempt to take profits many market players sold the 
dollar regardless of the figure he said 
the us commerce department said the nations trade deficit 
narrowed in february to a sixmonth low of 649 billion from a 
revised 932 billion deficit the previous month 
the dollars decline after the 15850 yen line is not because 
of position adjustments he said 
he said life insurance firms selling dollars were in part trying 
to get enough money for the may us bond auction 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average which 
rose 78746 points wednesday posted another 69635 points or 238 
percent ending the day at 2994541 in heavy trading volume 
traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billion shares up 
from wednesdays 450 million 
traders attributed the indexs surge largely to the yens sharp 
recovery 
market players now believe that they have gotten over with all 
the negative elements as the yen and bond prices started 
recovering said yoshio shimoyama a senior trader with nikko 
securities co 
the price of the benchmark 10year japanese government bonds was 
changing hands at 8638 points as of 4 pm up from wednesdays 
8614point close 
their yield was quoted at 7285 percent down from 7335 percent 
the previous day 
shimoyama said the market is recovering by itself after a series 
of plunges the market has lost 897046 points or 231 percent 
from its yearend recordhigh close at 3891587 
because the index has lost so much and also from our past 
experiences we believe the market had bottomed out he said but 
added that some uncertainties remain 
a trader with yamaichi securities co speaking on condition of 
anonymity said inspired by the yens recovery market players 
started buying issues to which they had been paying little 
attention

ceasefire talks involving the contra 
rebels the sandinista government and the incoming administration 
are on the verge of a breakdown according to a source close to the 
negotiations 
the parties were optimistically described as being near 
agreement on tuesday but on wednesday became bogged down in 
disputes the talks dragged on nine hours with no success reported 
suspicion remains high after nine years of civil war 
the contras said wednesday they were willing to negotiate an 
immedaite ceasefire but they said they would not disarm until the 
sandinistacontrolled army is under the control of violeta barrios 
de chamorros civilian government which takes over from president 
daniel ortega next wednesday 
the sandinistas have warned that a failure by the contras to 
disarm could endanger a peaceful transfer of power 
an observer from the organization of american states said late 
wednesday that the talks were very delicate and on the edge of 
breaking down the observer spoke on condition of anonymity and 
gave no further details 
chief contra negotiator oscar sovalbarro said earlier that the 
rebels want to avoid the continued shedding of blood but 
expressed distrust for the sandinistas main objective to see the 
rebels disarmed before inauguration day 
he said there were 15000 rebels in the nicaraguan countryside 
most estimates put the number at 9000 the fighters recently began 
infiltrating back into nicaragua from border camps in honduras 
their base in waging war against the sandinistas with us support 
suspicion on both sides remains high and the sandinista party 
newspaper barricada accused the contras of playing a double game 
of promises of demobilization and threats to the contrary 
they are all working toward the same tactical objective 
gaining time so the demobilization does not start before april 25 
while at the same time recently infiltrated troops occupy 
advantageous military positions in the mountainous zones it said 
in an editorial wednesday 
barricada demanded mrs chamorros coalition the united 
national opposition abide by its promise to respect the 
integrity and professionalism of the army in exchange for 
officers giving up leadership positions in any political party 
sandinista party officials now control the force 
on wednesday evening about 200 people demanding the immediate 
dismantling of the contras surrounded the organization of american 
states building where the talks were being held 
were not leaving until they sign to demobilize said a 
young woman who gave only her first name carla 
the group threatened representatives of the contras and mrs 
chamorros advisers said antonio lacayo head of mrs chamorros 
transition team no police were present 
ortega called on the negotiators to contribute patriotically 
to reach an accord that sets the exact date for the demobilization 
and disarming of the contras 
the contras stance increases the chance that mrs chamorro who 
defeated ortega in feb 25 elections could face a threat of 
protest strikes and other actions by sandinistadominated labor 
groups 
at a news conference the contras said they wanted to clarify a 
series of contradictory statements issued since their arrival 
tuesday morning from the honduran capital of tegucigalpa 
we want to be clear that the resistance maintains its 
position as long as the destiny of the sandinista army is not 
known which cadres are going to control the army of nicaragua we 
cannot take the next step aristides sanchez said 
the three parties concluded a rough draft of a 12point document 
dealing with the ceasefire and five security zones in which the 
contras are to gather before turning in their weapons 
we have had promises from the presidentelect that the 
necessary reforms will be made reforms that can bring the 
reconciliation of the nicaraguan people sanchez said

gov joseph adas chief counsel contends in 
court papers that the 1973 us supreme court decision guaranteeing 
the right to an abortion does not apply to this us territory 
the memorandum argued that roe vs wade and webster v 
reproductive health services the july decision giving states more 
authority to restrict abortion without overturning the earier 
ruling are not in force in guam because it is a territory 
ada signed the nations most restrictive antiabortion measure 
into law last month enforcement remains on hold pending a hearing 
in federal court may 8 on a challenge brought by a woman who wants 
an abortion 
katherine maraman the governors legal counsel and attorney 
monessa lujan argued that many of the constitutions due process 
and equalprotection provisions do not fully apply to guam in 
recognition of its traditions 
the new law if upheld by the court would make it a felony for 
doctors to perform abortions and a misdemeanor for women to have 
abortions except in cases where the pregnancy would endanger the 
mothers life 
the measure also makes it a misdemeanor to solicit women to have 
an abortion

a study of more than 1000 people who had 
skincancer surgery found that nearly half continued to stay in the 
sun in the belief that cancer was not enough of a problem to give 
up a tan 
still a leading dermatologist sees the sun setting on 
sunbathing 
im encouraged in the way attitudes are changing said dr 
howard k koh chairman of the american academy of dermatology 
committee coordinating its annual effort to encourage skin cancer 
prevention and detection 
i think the message is out that the deep tan is unhealthy 
the study found 44 percent had not changed their habits 
concerning outdoor activities one year after removal of their 
cancers despite a doctors repeated counseling 
thirtyeight percent said they still werent using sunscreens 
despite their doctors advice said the study published in the 
april issue of the american medical associations archives of 
dermatology 
though giving up sunbathing was the most common behavior among 
subjects after surgery 24 percent admitted they were still 
suntanning a year later 
the attitude of these noncompliant individuals who were 
usually women was that skin cancer was not enough of a problem to 
give up a tan said the studys author dr june k robinson a 
dermatologist at northwestern university medical school in chicago 
the patients who disregarded their doctors advice said a tan 
made them feel good and that the sunscreens have an 
objectionable sticky feeling wrote ms robinson 
all subjects underwent surgery between 1983 and 1987 they were 
counseled before and after by ms robinson and a nurse who told 
them they could reduce their risk for subsequent cancers by 
reducing sun exposure wearing protective clothing and using 
sunscreens 
the study focused on nonmelanoma skin cancer because its known 
cause is the builtup effect of sun exposure over several years 
koh said 
though rarely fatal nonmelanoma skin cancer will strike an 
estimated 600000 americans this year the american cancer society 
says 
in contrast melanoma skin cancer is expected to strike 27600 
americans in 1990 and kill 5300 
its cause is less certain but is believed to be partly 
intermittent harsh sun exposure particularly during adolescence 
koh said 
skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the united 
states with the number of cases of malignant melanoma doubling 
each decade according to the american academy of pediatrics 
ms robinson wrote that of the 1042 patients who answered 
anonymous questionnaires 56 percent said they had changed their 
outdoor activities

china said today it cannot tolerate support 
for a radio ship that plans to transmit prodemocracy messages into 
the country and did not rule out the use of force to stop the 
broadcasts 
the activities of this ship are aimed at subverting the 
peoples government and are against the norms of international 
relations foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua told a news 
conference 
therefore we cannot tolerate the support of that ship 
the 1200ton goddess of democracy left france on march 17 
for international waters off the chinese coast where it plans to 
broadcast music news and prodemocracy reports to the mainland 
the converted trawlers mission is sponsored by a coalition of 
groups headed by the french magazine actuel and with the 
cooperation of the federation for a democratic china a parisbased 
chinese dissident organization 
china has formally protested to the french government about the 
boat and sponsors have charged that the ship has been under 
constant surveillance and intimidation by the chinese 
authorities since it left port 
actuel on monday said its editorial offices in paris were broken 
into over the weekend with documents and computer disks related to 
the ship stolen a reporter for the magazine said the disks were 
returned on wednesday in a nonstamped envelope carried to the 
magazines offices by a postman 
the goddess of democracy is named after the statue erected 
by prodemocracy students in tiananmen square last spring before 
chinese troops crushed the movement for a freer china killing 
hundreds of people 
li refused to answer several questions on whether china would 
resort to force to stop the broadcasts saying only that she had 
nothing to offer on that question 
she said the radio ship is a tool of the reactionary 
organization front for democracy in china federation for a 
democratic china we are resolutely opposed to the provision of 
support or facilities to it by any state region organization or 
individual 
chinese authorities have protested the mission to france as 
gross interference in chinas internal affairs the french 
government says it is not involved in the project 
the ship which is equipped with one television and two radio 
studios is now in the indian ocean headed for singapore it plans 
to begin broadcasting into the mainland by the end of april 
sponsors say the ship suffered 10 days of administrative hassles 
in the port of djibouti on the horn of africa

charges including murdering a foreign official 
fbi agents arrested suarez on april 11 in st petersburg fla 
he had been a fugitive since his indictment in 1978 with seven 
other people in the 1976 bomb blast that killed letelier as he was 
driving along washingtons embassy row a woman aide also was 
fatally injured 
a former chilean diplomat jose miguel barros testified in a 
chilean court last year that leteliers assassination was ordered 
by chilean army gen juan manuel contreras sepulveda who headed 
the chilean national intelligence agency 
contreras is one of three men sought in the case and us 
attorney jay stephens said he has not given up hope of having them 
brought to justice the recently replaced military government of

anticastro group was drawn into the murder by officials of chile 
letelier had been ambassador to the united states from 1970 to 1973 
under the marxist government of salvador allende his killing

intelligence agency and served a prison term in the case said

attorney general yosef harish today ordered 
police to remove 150 jewish settlers from a building complex in the 
christian quarter of jerusalems old city 
the jews occupation of a 72room building complex in the 
christian area on april 11 set off a week of angry protests by 
christian clerics and palestinians both christian and moslem 
about 30 police and border guards were stationed outside the 
four 100yearold buildings owned by the greek orthodox church just 
after the order was issued 
asked if the settlers would be ejected today police spokesman 
uzi sandori said its almost certain but not sure 
ben elon one settler said the group had not yet received 
harishs eviction order asked if they would comply with the order 
elon said we will honor all legal decisions 
harishs order said the settlers have not proved the right to 
occupy the complex he said he took the action to prevent further 
deterioration of relations between the christian and jewish 
communities in jerusalem 
if the jews are removed from the building it would be the first 
time settlers have been dislodged since april 1982 when israeli 
soldiers evacuated 3000 settlers from yamit in the sinai 
peninsula ceded to egypt under its peace treaty with israel 
abdul wahab daroushe an arab member of israels parliament 
visited the jerusalem site and told the settlers the jews should 
leave 
i dont think there are any lack of apartments for these 
people to live in they are a provocation here he said 
the jews move into the christian quarter upset a tradition in 
which religious communities in the old city live in separate and 
jealously guarded neighborhoods 
the settlement also has political implications since the old 
city is part of the area captured from jordan in the 1967 middle 
east war israel annexed the area to its capital but most 
countries including the united states do not recognize israels 
claim to sovereignty 
the settlement led to court action by the greek orthodox church 
to dislodge the settlers 
the church maintained a former tenant acted illegally when he 
sold his rights to live in the building leading to establishment 
of the jewish settlement the settlers argued they had a legal 
contract from a panamanian company to sublet

the bush administration responding to a 
lessening of tensions in europe is indefinitely postponing the 
production of new shortrange nuclear missiles that were to be 
deployed in west germany us officials said today 
the 88 new launchers 36 of which were to be controlled by the 
united states and the others by west germany britain and the 
netherlands were designed for targeting on east germany 
the tentative us goal was to begin deploying them in 1995 to 
replace the current mixture of nucleararmed and conventional lance 
missiles 
but east germany is rapidly moving out of the soviet sphere and 
preparing for union with west germany it is no longer perceived as 
a threat to the north atlantic treaty organization countries 
the current arsenal of lances will remain in west germany 
however those with nuclear warheads have a range of about 75 
miles and the nonnuclear weapons are designed to hit targets 
within 45 miles 
the new launchers were intended to have a greater range of about 
280 miles just below the level of intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles that were banned in a ussoviet treaty in 1987 
the present system is a viable deterrent through the year 
2000 even though the army would have liked to start deployment of 
new lances in 1995 a us official said 
the current lances recently were touched up with new fuel for 
their rockets the replacement of wornout components and other 
maintenance

two hollywood studios that banned onscreen 
advertisements at theaters showing their movies have come under 
investigation by the federal trade commission according to 
published reports 
fred haynes chief of the ftc antitrust divisions motion 
picture section revealed the probe of walt disney studios and 
warner bros at a recent board meeting of the national association 
of theater owners in washington the los angeles times reported 
today 
the ftc would neither confirm nor deny the existence of the 
investigation first reported wednesday in the entertainment trade 
paper daily variety the times said 
justice department spokesman joe krovinsky said wednesday that 
officials there were aware of the ftc probe because the agencies 
check with each other to avoid duplicating efforts 
officials with disney and warner said the studios had not been 
contacted by the ftc and they would not comment on the reports the 
times said 
disney and warner have said many moviegoers dislike the 
commercials and the studios feared the bad feelings could extend to 
their feature films 
some theater owners have said the policy infringes on their 
right to offset costs by showing commercials before movies 
the ftc enforces laws governing restraint of trade which is the 
restriction or prevention of business competition 
both disney and warner have said they will allow theaters 
existing advertising contracts to expire before they impose the 
bans

all the new lances were supposed to be nucleararmed 
their potential deployment had stirred opposition among west 
german groups eager to promote disarmament and concerned that 
deploying new weapons on their territory could make west germany a 
more inviting target in the event of a war 
as eastwest tensions eased support for the missiles declined 
in the west german government and among several of the north 
atlantic treaty organization allies 
still the reagan and bush administrations resisted efforts led 
by west germany for negotiations to eliminate both nato and warsaw 
pact shortrange missiles until a treaty to cut back troops tanks 
and other weapons in europe is concluded 
the accord is still not finished but the officials said the 
bush administration has decided not to have the army missile 
command solicit proposals from munitions makers for manufacturing 
new lance missiles 
the project has been put on indefinite hold said a us 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the current lance arsenal would serve as a deterrent 
through the rest of the century

area code 212s number is up and that means 
new york could have three area codes in a few years

new york telephone expects to run out of numbers for that area code 
in manhattan and the bronx in 1993 company spokesman peter muller 
said 
muller said the companys best guess is that it will add an 
area code that year new york telephone has reserved 917 for future 
use 
the state public service commission voted wednesday to begin 
looking at the issue and to solicit comments 
one option would be to assign the new area code to cellular and 
pager numbers said commission spokesman edward collins no area in 
the country has a special area code for portable phones and 
beepers he said 
the five boroughs that make up new york city used to have one 
area code 212 in 1985 the numbers in that area code were used up 
and the 718 area code was created for brooklyn staten island and 
queens 
new york and los angeles are the nations only two cities with 
two area codes los angeles county is getting a third area code in 
1992 that pacific bell says will include parts of the city

the gap between federal income taxes owed and 
paid is about 100 billion a year and growing and internal revenue 
service enforcement efforts are likely to cut it by only about 
onefourth congress was told today 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr said the tax gap was as 
much as 968 billion in 1988 and predicted it will rise to 127 
billion in 1992 the figure includes only the federal income taxes 
owed on legal income the total gap including taxes on illegal 
earnings and social security and estate taxes has been estimated 
unofficially at 200 billion a year or more 
the tax gap does not include about 87 billion of accounts 
receivable which are taxes assessed by the irs but still unpaid 
over several years 
a 100 billion shortfall is certainly a cause for concern 
particularly in todays world of sizable deficits goldberg told 
the house ways and means oversight subcommittee he noted however 
that last year the irs collected over 1 trillion all but 25 
billion of it paid through selfassessment by the taxpayers 
the plain fact is that voluntary compliance has been and 
remains the backbone of our tax system goldberg said although 
tougher enforcement efforts are essential he added we cannot 
lose sight of the fact that a 1 percent swing in voluntary 
compliance will increase or decrease revenues each year by more 
than 5 billion 
his prescription for the problem simplified tax laws a 
modernized computer system and better quality assistance to 
taxpayers taxpayers are willing to pay what they owe they 
cannot abide complexity uncertainty administrative burdens and 
hassles with the irs that may take months or years to resolve 
goldberg said 
since the irs began tracking the tax gap voluntary compliance 
by individual taxpayers has remained fairly constanty as high as 
83 percent in 1973 827 percent in 1988 and a forecast of 836 
percent in 1992 corporate compliance estimated at 866 percent in 
1973 has risen to 881 percent 
in 1987 the lastest year for which complete figures are 
available 258 percent of the tax gap was attributed to informal 
supplies such as roadside vendors and homerepair workers 
underreporting income large corporations were next at 178 percent 
individuals who did not bother to file a return accounted for 
76 percent of the gap failure to report capital gains was 
responsible for 71 percent miscellaneous business income 
including rent and partnership income accounted for 67 percent 
the irs found that 99 percent of wages interest and dividends 
was reported the remainder accounted for 46 percent of the gap 
goldberg estimated that 505 billion of income taxes were due in 
1987 and that 411 billion was paid voluntarily leaving a gross 
tax gap of 94 billion irs enforcement efforts including audits 
and collection initiatives brought in 22 billion leaving a net 
gap of 72 billion

nepals first independent government in 
almost three decades took office today less than two weeks after 
the king lifted a ban on political parties 
king birendra swore in nepali congress party president krishna 
prasad bhattarai a former political prisoner as prime minister 
and leader of an interim coalition government until elections 
promised for within a year 
after taking the oath of office at the royal palace in central 
katmandu bhattarai swore in nine ministers at the government 
secretariat one member of the 11minister cabinet was to arrive in 
the capital later bhattarai said 
four ministers including bhattarai belong to the nepali 
congress three to the united left front two are birendras 
nominees and two are independents 
the responsibility weighs very heavy on my shoulders 
bhattarai said after the swearingin ceremony hundreds of people 
packed the conference hall where the ministers took their oaths in 
a private ceremony 
bhattarai said his governments first priority will be to try 
to lessen the economic difficulties of the people and make life 
easier and less expensive than what it is today 
nepal is one of the worlds poorest countries its 17 million 
people have an average annual income of 150 dollars a year and 75 
percent of them are illiterate 
nepali congress leader ganesh man singh who declined birendras 
proposal to become prime minister because of poor health said 
economic reforms were important but cannot be achieved in a day 
and people should not have unwarranted aspirations 
the swearingin capped the prodemocracy movement that started 
feb 18 with a series of marches and strikes that spawned a popular 
groundswell in this remote himalayan monarchy where political 
activity had been forbidden since 1961 
on april 6 police opened fire on 200000 demonstrators marching 
on birendras palace killing 200 according to witnesses the 
government claims no more than 10 died 
two days later the king yielded to the mass movement led by the 
nepali congress and the united left front and lifted a 29year ban 
on political parties 
on april 16 birendra dissolved the partyless legislature and 
announced the resignation of his governments prime minister 
lokendra bahadur chand 
those had been the main conditions of the nepali congress and 
the united left front for joining a palaceproposed interim 
government 
the ministers oath called for allegiance to nepals present 
constitution which gives nearabsolute powers to the king 
but bhattarai has said a proposed constitutional reforms 
commission would draft a new constitution reducing the kings 
powers and possibly make nepal a constitutional monarchy 
the new government has also promised to hold multiparty 
elections within a year 
the nepali congress formed the countrys first democratically 
elected government in 1959 but it lasted only 20 months before 
birendras father king mahendra dismissed it accusing it of 
corruption and poor administration 
bhattarai was parliament speaker in the 195960 government he 
was jailed for nine years immediately after mahendra dissolved that 
government and spent five more years in jail at different times for 
political agitation

officers killed four blacks 
today just hours after president fw de klerk ordered an 
investigation into the police shooting of 11 unarmed blacks who 
were protesting high rents 
police said officers shot and killed four youths and wounded 
another at the rammulotsi black township near viljoenskroon in the 
orange free state police opened fire during a demonstration but 
officials declined to give any details 
earlier de klerk appointed a judicial commission to investigate 
the march 26 police action in the black township of sebokeng the 
african national congress had pulled out of peace talks with the 
government over the killings judge richard goldstone will head the 
inquiry the government said 
in other developments police said five more people died in 
black factional fighting in natal province including a black 
police officer who was stabbed they said a 14yearold boy and a 
9yearold girl were burned to death in necklace killings 
blazing tires were put around their necks 
police said a police barracks in the black township of soweto 
outside johannesburg was attacked wednesday with grenades but 
there were no injuries 
the government also announced that military reservists would be 
required to do 60 days duty a year instead of 30 days because of 
growing unrest 
de klerk made the decision to appoint a judicial commission to 
look into the police action in sebokeng which is outside 
johannesburg after meeting late wednesday with his cabinet judge 
richard goldstone will head the inquiry 
anc leader walter sisulu welcomed de klerks decision saying 
police actions must be investigated 
a judicial commission is important in our situation because it 
is able more or less to sift through things not depend on 
opinions he said 
police said they were forced to open fire when protesters 
threatened officers blocking the march 
defense minister magnus malan said military service for army 
reservists had to be increased to 60 days because of unrest in 
natal and other parts of the country 
this situation as well as the potential for unrest elsewhere 
in the country make an extension of the service period 
unavoidable as a temporary measure he said in a statement 
malan challenged the anc to drop its support for armed 
resistance to the white government he said all responsible groups 
had to help end the wave of unrest that has claimed more than 500 
lives this year 
no peace process can in reality take place if violence 
continues or when violence is held out as an option he said 
revolutionary intimidation and mobilization of people is 
taking place on a wide scale and is connected with the ancs links 
to the continuation of the armed struggle 
de klerk earlier this week demanded the anc formally renounce 
its armed struggle the anc has refused to renounce violence even 
though its guerrilla forces are virtually inactive 
de klerk legalized the anc and freed nelson mandela in february 
to try and clear the way for talks on ending whiteminority rule 
and sharing power with the countrys black majority 
much of the violence sweeping south africa has involved rival 
black political factions the worst bloodshed has been in natal 
where hundreds have died in black faction fights

the sandinista government and the 
usbacked rebels signed a ceasefire agreement early today that 
calls on the contras to begin laying down their arms next week and 
to disband by june 10 
the ceasefire which began at noon today will be verified by 
un forces and nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
the document was signed by nicaraguas minister of defense gen 
humberto ortega rebel commanders oscar sovalbarro and aquilino 
ruiz robleto and representatives of presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
with this accord we conclude the peace process started with 
the elections said antonio lacayo chief of the chamorro 
transition team 
the yatama miskito indian group fighting alongside the contras 
on the atlantic coast reached a separate but similar disarmament 
agreement that establishes a ceasefire in the eastern half of the 
country at midnight today 
the accords appeared to end a tense standoff among the 
sandinista government chamorros incoming administration and the 
contras that had threatened to derail the transfer of power in 
nicaragua 
the signing came after lengthy negotiations including an 
allnight session that ended this morning the talks began on 
tuesday 
the agreement says the rebel forces should begin disarming on 
wednesday the day the chamorro government is inaugurated 
demobilization of the contra forces is to be completed by june 10 
at the latest 
the leftist sandinistas had demanded that the contras disarm 
before they handed power to the new civilian government but gen 
ortega said today that it was more important that peace be reached 
as soon as possible 
we all made an effort so that it the dismantling would have 
been on the 25th but technical hurdles made that impossible 
gen ortega said 
he said the delay was nothing if we compare it to the tragedy 
and suffering that we have had during these years of war 
the accord says the contras weapons will be surrendered in a 
voluntary form in the presence of un forces and obando y bravo 
it also establishes security zones for the rebels inside 
nicaragua so they can begin regrouping immediately in preparation 
for demobilization and disarmament during the decadelong war 
between the contras and the sandinista government many of the 
contras were based in honduras 
under the accord signed today sandinista forces are to start 
withdrawing immmediately from the five security zones and complete 
the withdrawal by saturday the sandinista forces are required to 
stay at least 12 miles from the zones and are prohibited from 
conducting flights over the zones 
the government has guaranteed the safety of the rebels and their 
families and said it will respect their civil liberties 
the agreement calls for roman catholic monitors to provide 
transportation for the rebels and their families to the security 
zones and give them humanitarian aid 
the contras had said on wednesday they were willing to negotiate 
an immediate ceasefire but would not disarm until the 
sandinistacontrolled army was brought under the control of the new 
civilian government 
sandinista president daniel ortega had warned that if the 
contras failed to disarm the peaceful transfer of power could be 
endangered 
there are at least 9000 rebels in the nicaraguan countryside 
the fighters recently began returning to nicaragua from border 
camps in honduras 
the talks began on tuesday lasted for six hours and then 
resumed again on wednesday afternoon lasting until about 530 this 
morning 
the negotiations were the first involving the opposition 
coalition backing chamorro known as uno the contras and the 
sandinistas since mrs chamorros 14party coalition defeated the 
sandinistas in feb 25 elections 
mrs chamorro will take office for six years and her 
administration is counting on a peaceful nicaragua to deliver on 
her key campaign promise of reviving the economy 
ortega and mrs chamorro had called on the contras to disband 
however as soon as uno won the elections most of the contras 
slipped across the border into nicaragua leaving behind in 
honduras only the wounded the crippled and a few old guns 
that reduced the effectiveness of a unocontra accord of march 
23 under which contra forces in honduras were to disarm the accord 
set no firm date 
washington backed the contras in their nineyear war with the 
sandinistas that cost 57000 lives but supported mrs chamorros 
call for their dissolution fighting between the contras and 
sandinista forces had slowed to a virtual standstill in recent 
months with only sporadic fighting

attorney general dick thornburgh today 
confirmed that his chief spokesman had declined to steer a cbs 
reporter off a story about a criminal investigation involving rep 
william h gray iii dpa 
thornburgh who ordered an intensive criminal investigation of 
unauthorized disclosures about the case said in a statement that 
press secretary david runkel was following his standing 
instructions by declining to wave cbs reporter rita braver off the 
story 
thornburgh said runkel did not violate any department rules 
because he had not intended to confirm the story by refusing to 
deny information ms braver had obtained from other sources 
several days after cbs reported that gray was a subject of the 
probe the justice department issued a statement that the 
congressman was not a target of the investigation 
the department said at the time that gray was cooperating with 
the investigation of alleged financial irregularities in his 
congressional office 
thornburgh said that runkel in refusing to deny that a probe of 
gray was underway was following my standing instruction that no 
one in the department mislead the media 
unfortunately there are circumstances where a statement of 
the kind likely made here by mr runkel may be used by a reporter 
as confirmation of a story the attorney general said 
the attorney general who was attending a hemispheric drug 
enforcement conference in mexico issued the statement in response 
to a story in todays editions of the new york times that runkel 
had played a role in confirming the story reported by ms braver 
last spring 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian who read the 
attorney generals statement to reporters refused to comment on 
the times account that runkel had failed a lie detector test 
during the leak investigation conducted by federal prosecutors and 
the fbi 
thornburgh said that a refusal to deny or wave a reporter off 
a story with which he is confronted by the reporter does not in my 
view constitute misconduct 
a real distinction must be made i believe between an 
unsolicited and affirmative unauthorized disclosure and such a 
confirmation by one responsible for dealing with the media 
the cbs story produced a storm of indignation from democrats on 
capitol hill because it broke as gray was seeking election as house 
majority whip 
democrats charged the leaks from the justice department were 
politically inspired 
thornburgh ordered the justice department to conduct a criminal 
investigation in which more than 100 people were questioned and 
asked to make sworn statements 
runkel has refused to say if he was among those who took lie 
detector tests but has confirmed that he had given testimony before 
a federal grand jury that investigated the matter 
in december thornburgh reported to congress that the 
investigation has not produced sufficient evidence to enable me 
to ascertain that any present employee of the department of justice 
was responsible for the disclosure 
the attorney general responding to pressure from democratic 
lawmakers agreed recently to turn over the report of the 
investigation to the justice departments office of professional 
responsibility 
that unit conducts investigations of misconduct by justice 
department employees and can recommend to the attorney general that 
disciplinary action be taken against individuals 
eramian said the opr review has been completed and the 
attorney general has received that offices advice he declined 
to say what opr had advised

president bush met with french president 
francois mitterrand at a florida keys resort today to discuss the 
future of nato and how to respond to soviet pressure on the 
breakaway republic of lithuania 
were still trying to get verification of the exact situation 
there white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of the 
developing lithuanian crisis as bush flew to the florida keys for 
his meeting with mitterrand 
the kremlin sharply curtailed supplies of natural gas to 
lithuania today hours after it halted the flow of crude oil to the 
republic for refusing to scrap laws promoting independence 
lithuanian officials said 
president bush has begun a series of consultations with our 
allies on appropriate responses fitzwater said he telephoned 
german chancellor helmut kohl yesterday on this matter he will 
discuss it with president mitterrand this afternoon and we will be 
in touch with all of the allies either directly or through 
diplomatic channels in the next few days 
asked if joint nato or western action was being considered 
fitzwater said i wouldnt put it in that category i think its 
more a consultation about what individual countries might do what 
their approach might be 
were still trying to get dialogue trying to get both sides 
to use whatever maneuvering room they have said fitzwater 
the spokesman also said the us government had received a 
message from syria wednesday saying it appears an american hostage 
would be released as the islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine said earlier 
we have statements of imminent release from islamic jihad and 
from syria but theres no way for us to know conclusively that 
its going to happen fitzwater said 
he said the state department has dispatched a reception team to 
wiesbaden west germany but cautioned that the reception team has 
been sent there before on rumors of a hostage release that never 
happened 
our position is that we want the unconditional release of all 
hostages we will not deal or negotiate for hostage release but 
were hopeful this could be real fitzwater said 
todays meeting of bush and mitterrand is the seventh time the 
two leaders have met since bush became president 15 months ago 
after flying across the atlantic in a concorde jet the french 
leader joined bush at the exclusive ocean reef club the two 
leaders went to the private waterfront estate of ohio businessman 
and friend richard farmer to begin eight hours of talks 
heading into the meeting bush waved off reporters questions 
about lithuania saying well answer all questions later 
the president said earlier he hoped the session with mitterrand 
will narrow any differences that might exist between france and 
the united states on the postcold war role of the north atlantic 
treaty organization the wests political and military alliance 
there have been reports that there was a little drift and a 
little separation between the two allies on the future of nato 
bush said in an interview monday the best way to find that out 
is simply to sit and talk 
fitzwater said that in addition to nato and german unification 
bush and mitterrand will discuss the may 30 ussoviet summit as 
well as the presidents recent talks with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze 
bush who met last week with canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney in toronto and british prime minister margaret thatcher in 
bermuda said ive tried hard as president to stay in close 
touch with our alliance leaders and these talks given the 
rapidity of change in eastern europe seemed very timely 
france has enjoyed a special independent status within nato 
ever since the late charles de gaulle pulled french forces out of 
the alliances integrated military structure in 1966 de gaulle was 
unwilling to cede control of french forces to natos supreme 
commander an american general 
now as the two germanys head toward unification bush and the 
entire nato alliance have insisted that the new germany must be a 
full member of nato including its military arm the soviet union 
has dropped its insistence that germany be neutralized but has 
suggested overlapping nato and warsaw pact membership 
mitterrand planned to fly back to paris aboard the supersonic 
jet tonight after eight hours of private meetings a news 
conference and dinner with his american host 
for bush it was the prelude to an outdoorsy earth day weekend 
that he will spend fishing in the everglades off islamorada fla 
after side trips to republican fundraisers in birmingham ala and 
orlando fla on friday

mayor federico pena has ordered an investigation 
into the denver coroners office following questions about its 
handling of the deaths of two small children 
pena on wednesday asked the denver department of health and 
hospitals to conduct a thorough review he said he specifically 
wants an analysis of the working relationship between the coroners 
office the district attorneys office the police department and 
other city agencies 
attorneys and medical experts have questioned the competence of 
a pathologist dr robert deters who was temporarily hired by the 
coroners office during a staff shortage the offices of the 
colorado public defender and the denver district attorney 
separately have requested second opinions on deters rulings in the 
deaths of two children 
the district attorney is questioning the case of 16monthold 
salvador rodriguez of denver who was hospitalized jan 17 and died 
three days later several doctors at the hospital said he showed 
signs of having been hit on the ear but deters ruled that the 
child had died of complications resulting from an ear infection 
in another case involving a 2monthold boy allegedly starved 
to death by his mother the public defenders office accused the 
coroners office of withholding autopsy reports and failing to 
perform required tests 
questions also have been raised about deters findings in other 
cases 
deters on wednesday said his work had remained topquality 
despite a caseload of more than 500 autopsies in 16 months 
i worked hard i put in some long hours and i devoted whatever 
time was required to the job thoroughly he said 
john fairman manager of the denver health department said the 
coroners office turned to deters head of the pathology department 
at mckee medical center in loveland for a few months help after 
its fulltime pathologist resigned and the parttime pathologist 
was transferred 
but the contract period grew to 10 months during which time 
deters performed 390 autopsies for denver plus others for mckee 
and for counties in northern colorado and wyoming deters says he 
has worked as much as 80 hours a week during the past 10 months 
with few days off 
he was paid 234000 for the autopsies performed for denver 
at a news conference at denver general hospital wednesday 
deters initially declined to discuss the cases in which his rulings 
have been challenged because of possible litigation 
but he later stood by his decision in the rodriguez case 
also at the news conference officials with the denver 
department of health and hospitals the coroners office and mckee 
defended deters work 
he stepped forward voluntarily and has worked extremely hard 
to provide competent highquality work said dr ben galloway 
acting director of forensic pathology at the denver coroners 
office 
denver this month hired a new fulltime pathologist which is 
expected to ease the crisis in the coroners office fairman said 
deters remains on contract but can now reduce his workload

the 1990 census could cost an extra 100 
million or more census director barbara e bryant said today as 
she urged americans who have not returned their forms to do so 
it could cost the bureau an extra 10 million to count each 1 
percent of citizens who dont mail back their forms she told the 
house census subcommittee currently the response rate is 7 percent 
below plan 
asked if the total shortfall would be close to 100 million 
bryant said it could be more than that 
some 48 million census forms have been returned by the post 
office as undeliverable detailed plans exist to send workers out 
to count people on their doorsteps 
we plan to follow up on every housing unit for which a 
questionnaire was not returned and we have the workforce to do 
it she said 
the census is not over bryant emphasized calling on americans 
to mail back their forms workers will begin visitimg homes next 
week but the bureau is always happy to get mailedback forms she 
said 
currently 63 percent of households have mailed back their 
census forme she said the bureau had hoped for a 70 percent mail 
response 
census workers have been handdelivering forms to many of the 
missed blocks and buildings a process that has delayed response in 
many areas thus the bureau continues to urge people to fill out 
the forms and send them back although the count officially took 
place on april 1 
the updated figures show wisconsin as the most responsive state 
with 745 percent of households having sent back their forms 
alaska is trailing at 471 percent 
among major cities columbus ohio was leading with a 719 
percent response rate 
other major cities with high return rates included indianapolis 
686 percent minneapolisst paul 662 percent el paso 649 
percent kansas city 644 percent and seattle 642 percent 
boston was last at 454 percent and new orleans was also low at

rembrandts night watch 
masterpiece will go back on display may 1 less than one month 
after being sprayed with sulfuric acid by a man believed to be 
mentally disturbed officials said thursday 
no extra security will be introduced to protect the painting 
despite the fact the april 6 attack was the third against the 
rembrandt this century said det de beus spokeswoman for the 
rijksmuseum 
the huge 1642 painting will be returned to its customary 
centerstage spot in the main gallery in the rijksmuseum the 
nations largest treasure trove of art 
a protective veneer layer prevented any damage to the work of 
art according to ms de beus 
the painting can withstand an attack as it is she told the 
associated press adding its not as if it is attacked every 
day the last one was 15 years ago 
in 1975 a dutch schoolmaster claiming to be on a divine mission 
slashed the painting with a knife he was sent to a psychiatric 
hospital where he committed suicide 
during world war i a jobless shoemaker slashed the canvas to 
protest his inability to find work 
in the latest attack a 31yearold dutchman squirted sulfuric 
acid onto the canvas he is undergoing psychiatric treatment 
the acid ate away at the veneer layer leaving several dozen 
white streaks over a onesquareyard area of the canvas the 
painting measures 12by145 feet 
but the paint layer was not harmed at all said ms de beus 
adding that restorers were able to begin refinishing the painting 
last week without having to retouch the paintwork 
working in a dustfree room in the museum the restorers will 
apply the second and final veneer coat friday it is expected to 
dry by may 1 
the protective veneer layer was put on the painting during the 
lengthy restoration that followed the 1975 attack 
night watch a group portrait of 17thcentury dutch 
militiamen draws far more museum viewers than any other painting 
in the netherlands 
the priceless painting renowned for rembrandts mastery of 
light and dark is not insured in line with dutch government policy 
two guards are stationed by the night watch during museum 
hours one of them sprayed a neutralizing agent over the painting 
after the acid attack 
a kneehigh steel barrier keeps viewers approximately two yards 
away from the painting

krishna prasad bhattarai a leader of the 
prodemocracy movement who spent 14 years in jail on thursday 
became prime minister of nepals first independent government in 
almost three decades 
king birendra administered bhattarais oath of office at the 
royal palace embarking on a new political course for the himalayan 
monarchy where birendra once wielded absolute power 
after the ceremony at narayanheti palace bhattarai drove to 
the government secretariat where he swore in nine ministers his 
10th minister missed the ceremony because of a flight delay the 
prime minister said 
the responsibility weighs very heavy on my shoulders 
bhattarai said after the swearingin ceremony which was attended 
by government officials and hundreds of supporters 
bhattarai president of the nepali congress party now heads a 
coalition interim government composed of democrats communists 
royalists and independents 
four ministers including bhattarai belong to the nepali 
congress three are members of the sevenparty united left front 
two are birendras nominees and two are independents 
bhattarai said his government would like to lessen the 
economical difficulties of the people and make life easier and 
less expensive than what it is today 
nepal has a per capital annual income of 150 and is one of the 
worlds poorest countries seventyfive percent of its 17 million 
people are illiterate 
the palace ceremony was closed to the public and press hundreds 
of people packed the secretariat conference hall the size of a 
hockey field where the ministers were sworn in 
the prodemocracy movement led by nepali congress and the 
united left front started feb 18 with a series of demonstrations 
and strikes in this remote mountain kingdom where political protest 
was forbidden 
on april 8 birendra bowed to protesters demands and lifted a 
29yearold ban on political parties 
the surprising announcement followed an april 6 crackdown on 
demonstrators that witnesses called a massacre authorities said 10 
people were killed and 107 injured that day throughout the country 
witnesses said 200 died in katmandu alone when police fired on 
marchers 
on april 16 birendra dissolved the nonpartisan national 
assembly and announced the resignation of the government meeting 
major opposition demands 
the two cabinet members nominated by birendra are achyut raj 
regmi a minister in the former cabinet and a former nepali 
congress member and keshar jung rayamajhi a former nepal 
communist party member 
the ministers oath called for allegiance to nepals present 
constitution which gives nearabsolute powers to the king but 
bhattarai has said a new constitution will be drafted to reduce the 
kings powers 
the new government has promised to hold multiparty elections 
within a year 
the nepali congress formed the countrys first democratically 
elected government in 1959 it lasted only 20 months before 
birendras father king mahendra dismissed it accusing it of 
corruption and poor administration 
mahendra introduced a new constitution and ruled the country 
through the national assembly and the submissive government 
bhattarai was the parliament speaker in the 195960 government 
he was jailed for nine years immediately after mahendra dissolved 
that government and spent a total of five more years in jail at 
different times for political agitation

the kremlin sharply curtailed supplies of natural 
gas to lithuania today hours after it halted the flow of crude oil 
to the republic for refusing to scrap laws promoting independence 
lithuanian officials said 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said moscows economic 
embargo was tantamount to it recognizing his baltic republics 
independence 
a soviet energy official however said the lithuanians got what 
they deserved for defying president mikhail s gorbachev who on 
friday threatened to cut off supplies unless they rescinded their 
independenceoriented laws 
a lithuanian government spokesman appealed over vilnius radio 
today for fuel conservation and maybe we will not be intimidated 
by these sanctions 
as the events in lithuania unfolded gorbachev met in the 
kremlin today with leaders of latvia and estonia and offered 
concessions and made threats in an effort to keep them in the 
soviet union participants said 
gorbachev offered both republics special status in the 
soviet union if they drop their attempts to follow lithuania into 
independence said raymond lochmelis of the latvian popular front 
and other officials present 
the soviet leader also proposed a loose confederative system 
instead of a union tightly controlled by the center he also 
reportedly threatened to end the talks unless estonia rescinded its 
claim that it is an occupied independent state and latvia canceled 
its plan to declare independence on may 3 
the flow of natural gas to lithuania was shut off in three 
pipelines two from latvia and one from minsk in byelorussia 
reducing supplies to lithuania by more than 80 percent lithuanian 
lawmakers said 
a fourth pipeline from slonim in byelorussia that supplies 
lithuania continued to provide 35 million cubic meters of gas to 
the republic guaranteeing a normal supply of gas for residents 
and communal domestic use in the lithuanian ssr parliamentary 
officials quoted the byelorussian gas concerns telegram as saying 
that leaves lithuania with only 16 percent of the gas it needs 
per day lithuania uses an average of 18 million cubic meters daily 
for industrial and domestic use 
lithuanian officials estimate the republic has enough oil to 
last six weeks to three months 
juozas martusevicius a lithuanian electrical official said 
moscow officials guaranteed that enough natural gas would be 
supplied to keep lithuanias elektrenai power plant functioning 
the plant also serves customers in the neighboring russian republic 
territory of kaliningrad lithuanias sole nuclear power station 
in ignalina is shut down for repairs 
lithuania is entirely dependent on moscow for oil and gas and 
the embargo was the toughest action gorbachev has taken in his 
effort to force the republic of 38 million people to rescind its 
march 11 declaration of independence 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said today 
that moscow might have some other restrictions to impose on 
lithuania but he refused to elaborate 
late wednesday night the oil to lithuanias only refinery 
stopped flowing through a pipeline feeding the plant from the 
russian city of polotsk according to bronius vainoras director of 
the facility 
vainoras told the british broadcasting corp that the refinery 
will have to close if supplies are not restored half of the 
refinery was working but at a reduced capacity he said 
landsbergis speaking after lithuanias parliament had refused a 
kremlin ultimatum and instead offered to negotiate said 
gorbachevs move represented economic coercion and economic 
warfare against a neighboring country 
truly this is recognition of the independence of lithuania 
he said it is hard to imagine why the people of lithuania 
irrespective of nationality and creed are being punished what was 
their crime 
in moscow deputy oil minister lev dmitrievich churilov said his 
department cut off the oil mostly siberian crude after 
receiving a decree from the soviet council of ministers ordering 
the shutdown until further special notice 
lithuanias mazhiekiai refinery processes about 12 million tons 
of petroleum products a year lithuania uses about a quarter of the 
output journalists quoted lithuanian government officials as 
saying 
neighboring baltic states latvia and estonia themselves moving 
along a slower path toward independence wont be hurt by the 
cutoff to lithuania churilov said lithuanias supplies will now 
go to the republics of byelorussia the ukraine and russia as well 
as eastern europe he said 
noting that he was expressing his personal opinion churilov 
told the associated press that the cutoff might teach the 
lithuanians a lesson 
maybe this measure can make them think a little he said 
they should not respond to appeals from the president and 
government with ultimatums 
lithuanian officials met today to discuss the cuts in energy 
supplies said spokesman ceslovas jursenas with the priority being 
given to the power industry bakeries and the food industry 
he said that in the areas of fuel and power lithuanians would 
be put on a starvation diet 
where we can give up the use of gas petrol any heating or 
lighting let us do this and then we will be able to survive 
longer and maybe we will not be intimidated by these sanctions 
jursenas said in his appeal 
sales of gasoline in lithuania tripled this week as motorists 
reacted to gorbachevs threat with panicbuying said lithuanian 
energy minister leonas asmantas 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene was in norway 
today seeking oil to help offset the embargo norwegian prime 
minister jan p syse said his country has not promised oil supplies 
to lithuania 
we dont expect the world to give us any concrete goods at the 
moment all we are after is moral support mrs prunskiene 
said we believe lithuania will survive without natural gas but 
life will be reduced cut off from normal possibilities 
the white house said today that president bush was consulting 
with us allies on appropriate responses to the lithuanian 
crisis 
prior to the cutoff secretary of state james a baker iii said 
action against lithuania could destroy commercial relations between 
the soviet union and the united states 
its very difficult to see some of the commercial aspects of 
our relationship surviving the use of force or coercion he said 
gorbachev has declared unconstitutional lithuanias moves to 
curtail the spring draft into the soviet army give residents 
lithuanian identity cards and seize the property of the communist 
party on lithuanian territory 
lithuania was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 along 
with the fellow baltic states of latvia and estonia

a top bush administration official said today 
that the us trade deficit could worsen this year and warned that 
japans closed markets pose important risks for the world 
economy 
treasury undersecretary david mulford said that there is more at 
stake than reducing americas huge trade imbalance he said growing 
protectionist threats could imperil world prosperity 
if we are going to preserve the global trading system we are 
going to have to insist that japan and others who share the 
benefits do their part mulford said clearly japan has not 
done its part 
mulfords comments were part of the administrations continuing 
campaign to pressure japan to open its markets further for foreign 
trade many have grown concerned that a big decline in the value of 
the yen in recent months threatens to worsen the 49 billion trade 
deficit between the two nations 
a weaker yen would make japanese products less expensive in this 
country while making american goods more costly in japan 
the depreciation of the yen and japans relatively closed 
markets are not sustainable over time as their continuation would 
pose important risks for the world economy mulford said in 
testimony before a senate banking subcommittee 
mulford said that any further improvement in americas broadest 
measure of trade the current account was likely to be very 
modest and the possibility of deterioration in the current account 
cannot be excluded 
mulfords comments echoed the outlook in a new adminisration 
assessemnt prepared by the treasury department which said further 
improvement in the trade balance this year would be modest at 
best 
while this forecast is in line with the view of many private 
economists it poses a threat to the optimistic economic 
assumptions underlying president bushs 1991 budget 
a widening of the trade deficit would worsen the slump in 
manufacturing as companies found it harder to sell their products 
overseas further weakness in manufacturing could seriously depress 
overall economic growth 
the broadest measure of us trade the current account posted 
a deficit of 1059 billion in 1989 it had posted an alltime high 
of 1437 billion in 1987 the current account measures both trade 
in merchandise and services a category that primarily reflects 
investment flows between countries 
so far this year the merchandise portion of the trade deficit 
has been on a roller coaster surging to 932 billion in january 
only to drop to 649 billion in february as oil imports retreated 
from a record high set the month before 
many private economists look for americas oil dependence to 
deepen in coming months as domestic production slumps further 
another negative factor on the trade front is the recent strength 
of the us dollar especially against the japanese yen 
a stronger dollar makes us goods less competitive on overseas 
markets and makes foreign imports cheaper for american consumers 
the united states has often joined with other leading industrial 
countries in coordinated efforts to keep currency rates in line as 
a way at attacking trade imbalances 
the group of seven nations the united states japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy last met in paris 
earlier this month they promised then to continue their 
coordination efforts but rejected petitions by japanese officials 
for stronger action to bolster the sagging yen 
in the trade assessment the administration declared that the 
yens weakness is a matter of concern with undesirable 
consequences for the global adjustment process 
treasury secretary nicholas brady gave a similar view in 
congressional testimony but did not offer any specific actions the 
administration was willing to take 
the us trade deficit with japan widened to 312 billion in 
february from 286 billion in january 
the administrations trade report said the dramatic political 
changes occurring in eastern europe had the potential of easing 
global trade imbalances 
the report said the unification of west and east germany should 
help lower west germanys large trade surpluses because the united 
country would have more demand for imported products however it 
said the prime beneficiaries of this development were likely to be 
other countries in europe not the united states 
on another point the report said taiwan and south korea had 
made progress in liberalizing their currency exchangerate policies 
but that both nations need to make further progress 
the two countries had been cited in previous reports for 
manipulating their currencies in order to bolster their export 
sales particularly with the united states their primary foreign 
market

the united states risks erosions of central 
americas recent democratic progress if it fails to fulfill aid 
commitments to honduras and its neighbors honduran president 
rafael callejas said thursday 
callejas said he encountered a lot of good will in 
discussions with administration and congressional officials this 
week on us plans to provide 80 million in economic aid to his 
country in the 1991 fiscal year 
but he also was realistic about the political unpopularity of 
foreign aid in the united states and the increased competition for 
aid dollars from emerging democracies in eastern europe 
we understand the difficulties in the united states and the 
new perspectives in eastern europe callejas said at a news 
conference 
without economic support the central american region will 
again have social unrest and its consequences will be a 
weakening of the democratic system 
us aid is the only source of shortterm financing for the 
countrys balance of payment needs he said 
he added the environment for government is not easy citing 
a decade of economic reversal in his country he said would take two 
decades to overcome 
but callejas said a 247 million international loan to pay off 
pastdue debts to international financial institutions will help 
honduras begin an economic turnaround by the end of next month 
since he was sworn in on jan 27 the 46yearold useducated 
president has launched sweeping economic reforms including raising 
taxes and cutting his governments budget to reduce the deficit 
increasing the regions political stability will help warm the 
climate for international investment callejas said specifically 
mentioning development of the tourism and agricultural sectors 
in the long run the vital element is not foreign aid but 
trade he said during his visit he sought to open talks about 
possible future opening of us markets to his countrys sugar 
coffee textiles and footwear said callejas 
he conceded those goods are politically subject to very 
intense dialogue because of protectionist sentiments in the 
united states and said no opening was likely in the next two years 
achieving perfection is very complex he said were 
looking for a political will demonstration that trade for central 
america will be opened 
on other subjects callejas said 
he welcomed news of a truce in nicaragua between the sandinista 
government and the usbacked contra rebels this implies that 
there is a guaranteed transition of the presidency in nicaragua and 
a willingness to dialogue in the search for solutions he said 
an informal congressional delegation from honduras is visiting 
cuba but there is no intent to formalize diplomatic relations 
it is the only hispanic nation in the hemisphere that is not 
democratic there is a requirement that they change their political 
attitudes he said 
it is too soon to talk about economic integration for central 
america until peace is achieved in el salvador and the new 
nicaraguan government can be solidified but an economic summit in 
june or july that will include belize and panama will be a forum 
for discussion of such issues he said

with eastwest tensions in decline the bush 
administration is postponing indefinitely the development of new 
shortrange nuclear missiles that were to be based in west germany 
us officials said thursday 
the 88 new launchers 36 of which were to be controlled by the 
united states and the others by west germany britain and the 
netherlands were designed for targeting on east germany they 
would have been capable of launching about 1600 missiles 
the tentative us goal had been to begin deploying the missiles 
in 1995 to replace the current mixture of nucleararmed and 
conventional lance missiles with an allnuclear force and an 
expanded range 
but east germany is rapidly moving out of the soviet orbit and 
preparing for union with west germany it is no longer perceived as 
a threat to the north atlantic treaty organization countries 
the current arsenal of lances will remain in west germany about 
700 carry nuclear warheads and have a range of about 75 miles the 
900 or so nonnuclear missiles in the arsenal are designed to hit 
targets within 45 miles 
the new launchers were intended to have a range of about 280 
miles just below the level of intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
that were banned in a ussoviet treaty in 1987 
sen sam nunn dga and chairman of the armed services 
committee called the decision sensible and in line with what he 
had advocated the move for some time 
in a speech nunn also called for sharp reductions in us 
forces in europe beyond the 225000 level proposed by the bush 
administration and tentatively approved by the soviet union which 
would cut back to 195000 troops beyond its border 
we should start planning on a residual force in europe on the 
order of 75000 to 100000 troops within five years nunn said 
he also suggested cutting the navys 14 carrier battle groups to 10 
to 12 
congress appropriated 32 million last year to develop the new 
lance missiles the pentagon has requested 112 million for this 
year overall the program would have cost more than 1 billion 
dunbar lockwood of the private arms control association estimated 
pete williams the pentagon spokesman said the future of the 
lance was a decision for the north atlantic treaty organization 
he said however that the army missiles command had put a hold 
on plans to issue a formal request for contractors proposals for 
building the new weapons 
the army has delayed the release of the final request for 
proposals on the followon to lance he said 
another us official told the associated press that the 
present system is a viable deterrent through the year 2000 even 
though the army would have liked to start deployment of new lances 
in 1995 
the current lances recently were touched up with new fuel for 
their rockets the replacement of wornout components and other 
maintenance 
all the new lances were supposed to be nucleararmed 
their potential deployment had stirred opposition among west 
german groups eager to promote disarmament and concerned that 
deploying new weapons on their territory could make west germany a 
more inviting target in the event of a war 
as eastwest tensions have eased support for the missiles has 
declined in the west german government and among several of the 
north atlantic treaty organization allies 
still the reagan and bush administrations resisted efforts led 
by west germany for negotiations to eliminate both nato and warsaw 
pact shortrange missiles until a treaty to cut back troops tanks 
and other weapons in europe is concluded 
the accord is still not finished but the officials said the 
bush administration has decided not to have the army missile 
command solicit proposals from munitions makers for manufacturing 
new lance missiles 
the project has been put on indefinite hold said a us 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the current lance arsenal would serve as a deterrent 
through the rest of the century

the senate agriculture committee voted 
thursday to increase spending for research on organic farming 
nearly tenfold 
conventional farming methods promoted by the federal government 
over the last several decades have involved a growing use of 
chemical fertilizers pesticides and herbicides which 
environmentalists and many farmers are beginning to consider 
detrimental 
the committee voted to increase the 45 million being spent 
this year on organic farming to 40 million annually it also 
authorized 10 million a year to train thousands of extension 
agents in nonchemical farming methods 
the authorization is the first major step the government has 
taken to get farming out of the chemical business 
the legislation approved on voice vote also would establish a 
groundwater office in the agriculture department to determine the 
extent of damage to drinking water caused by agriculture chemicals 
and how to correct it 
the proposals were among the provisions of the committees 
agricultural research section or title of its 1990 farm bill 
another provision requires usda to study the effects of climate 
change on food crops and forests 
many scientists believe that a four degree rise in average 
temperature could halve the worlds production of rice the staff 
of life for 70 percent of the worlds population said sen 
patrick leahy dvt chairman of the committee 
federal agriculture officials would be required to integrate 
global warming concerns into plant and forestry research planning 
and decisionmaking and to establish an office of climate change if 
the legislation is adopted 
both the senate and house agriculture committees have been 
working since january on the 1990 farm bill which will set policy 
for virtually all federal agriculture programs during the next five 
years 
the panels are in different stages of completion on the various 
parts of the legislation which they hope to have before the full 
congress by summer 
the senates section on research would authorize an 
unprecedented 400 million over the life of the bill for research 
grants to companies institutions and individuals studying plants 
animals nutrition and health natural resources and the 
environment new products and marketing and trade 
the bill also creates partnerships among researchers state and 
local governments private businesses and the federal government 
for developing and selling industrial products made from farm and 
forest crops 
progress is being made for example in using corn and wheat to 
make biodegradable plastic bags and diapers soybeans are being 
experimented with in the manufacture of lubricants and printing 
ink sunflowers in fuel and red dye meadowfoam in cosmetics and 
milkweed in pillow stuffing and backpacking equipment

the census bureau remains determined to count 
americans but the bureau director said thursday that lagging 
public response means it will take more people and money to do it 
we plan to follow up on every housing unit for which a 
questionnaire was not returned and we have the workforce to do 
it bureau director barbara e bryant told the house census 
subcommittee 
the only thing that has changed is that our workload of 
personalvisit followup will be larger than originally planned 
to date 63 percent of households have returned the forms the 
bureau had hoped for a 70 percent return by this time 
bryant said it would take an extra 5300 workers and cost an 
additional 10 million to count each percentage point below the 70 
percent level 
a 63 percent mail response is by no means a disaster she 
said 
rep tom sawyer dohio said he was deeply troubled by the 
low level of participation so far public confidence he said may 
be shaken by reports of millions of forms that could not be 
delivered for various reasons 
we have had some operational problems and our mailresponse 
came in lower than expected we remain convinced we will have 
an accurate census bryant said 
rep thomas ridge rpa said the bureau does have problems 
but its not a crisis its not a disaster 
you cannot conclude that we will not have an accurate 
census ridge said what you can conclude is that it will cost 
a lot more money 
bryant said the low response rate could boost the cost by 70 
million the bureau has already taken a 60 million cut in general 
government budget trimming 
asked if her agency would be asking for about 100 million in 
added money she declined to be specific 
it could be more than that she said 
the overall cost of the 1990 national head count spread over 10 
years is expected to total about 25 billion 
asked about problems in large buildings and whole towns and zip 
codes being missed bryant said about 5 million forms were mailed 
late because addresses were added for new developments and for 
places not included earlier 
in late summer there will be a followup to reach people who 
were missed and local governments will check the counts for 
accuracy she said 
about 48 million forms were returned to the bureau as 
undeliverable a rate bryant said was well below that of the 1980 
census she said that occurred in many cases because some people 
get their mail in post office boxes while the census uses street 
addresses 
the street addresses are needed to design political districts 
about 18 million of the returned forms have been delivered by 
hand of the remaining 3 million she said most will turn out to be 
vacant homes and apartments all locations will be visited 
people who have not received forms she said should call the 
bureau at 18009991990 
the bureau will begin sending out about 330000 workers april 26 
to visit homes where people did not respond bryant said

eastern airlines said today it would not appeal 
a federal bankruptcy judges appointment of a trustee to take 
control of the airline a move that ousts boss frank lorenzo from 
that role 
although we did not feel a trustee is warranted we are 
gratified judge burton lifland has indicated the airline will be 
reorganized and not broken into pieces said spokesman bob hunter 
in miami 
lifland late wednesday granted the request of easterns 
unsecured creditors who sought a trustee because of frustration 
over the carriers mounting losses and its plans to cut payments to 
creditors sharply 
the flying publics interest must at all times be taken into 
account lifland told a packed courtroom adding later its 
time to change the captain of easterns crew 
the head of easterns machinists while welcoming the move said 
today the action would not mean a quick end to his unions yearold 
strike 
it will not happen immediately eastern machinists president 
charles bryan told a news conference in miami obviously we have 
no interest in going back and sacrificing working very hard and 
bringing it out of bankruptcy only to still have frank lorenzo own 
all the common stock 
the judge appointed as trustee martin shugrue a pilot and 
airline executive who formerly worked for lorenzo chairman of 
eastern parent texas air corp 
shugrue a former president of continental airlines resigned 
last year under pressure from lorenzo texas air also is the parent 
of continental 
lorenzo left the courtroom without comment before the decision 
hunter said today that the company welcomed shugrues arrival 
there are no changes its business as usual hunter said 
his appointment does send a very clear message of judge liflands 
confidence in the companys future he said he would appoint a 
trustee to operate the airline not to liquidate it 
miamibased eastern has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization since march 1989 after a strike by its pilots 
machinists and flight attendants crippled its operations 
the unions had sought a trustee from the start claiming that 
lorenzo was bleeding eastern by transferring its assets to 
nonunion continental and texas air and they had heaped 
practically all their hostility on him alone 
dick nellis a representative of easterns pilots union said he 
was overjoyed at the ruling but added it is really very sad 
that it has taken so long for the system to recognize why the real 
eastern employees left the property in the first place 
literally there have been thousands of careers that have been 
shattered and billions of dollars of eastern airlines assets 
wasted he said 
earlier eastern president phil bakes testified that appointment 
of a trustee would prompt employees to quit hurt business further 
and heighten the chance eastern eventually would have to be 
liquidated 
ej breen a spokesman for the pilots union in miami said the 
appointment of shugrue would give eastern another chance to succeed 
the appointment of a trustee in a bankruptcy case is rare legal 
experts observed 
lifland said naming a trustee is an extraordinary remedy 
but he cited easterns staggering losses of more than 12 billion 
since the bankruptcy filing which he said had wiped out the 
parents equity 
the judge also noted numerous instances where the company had 
projected overly optimistic results and then cut the amount it 
proposed to repay creditors in successive reorganization plans 
the unsecured creditors who are owed 980 million had 
repeatedly emphasized that they did not seek a liquidation of the 
airline instead they asked for a trustee to operate eastern and 
perhaps seek a buyer for it 
lifland also said during the fourday hearing which began 
friday that if a trustee were appointed it would be someone to 
operate rather than liquidate the airline 
in closing statements easterns courtappointed bankruptcy 
examiner used strong language to describe the carriers losses and 
lorenzos management style although he did not formally take a 
position on the trustee request 
examiner david i shapiro told the court that other companies in 
chapter 11 had never been allowed to continue operating with such 
big losses and with such a total lack of confidence from creditors 
can mr lorenzo now be allowed to wipe out the creditors 
interest can anyone blame the creditors for being outraged he 
said mr lorenzo only starts negotiating at the very last 
minute hes just a tough guy to make a deal with 
because of lorenzos style shapiro added it would be easier to 
sell eastern under a trustee than under current management

east germanys prime minister on thursday 
said the germanys may merge their economies within eight weeks but 
he demanded that west germany pay a bigger price for unification 
lothar de maiziere also said east germany would defend the 
military interests of the soviet union but still would pursue the 
quick path to unification that moscow opposes 
de maiziere in his first speech to the freely elected 
parliament said a final plan for a single germany could be in 
place before parliament breaks for the summer 
in the next eight to 10 weeks we will lay the foundations for 
the economic monetary and social union so that this union can 
enter into force before the summer break he said 
he said east germany must be an equal partner in the talks and 
that the nations must agree on conditions that ensure east 
germans do not get the feeling of being secondclass german 
citizens 
while a single currency and shared social and economic 
institutions could be in place long negotiations are expected on 
the process of fully unifying the governments and creating a single 
nation the process is not expected to be completed until next year 
de maiziere reiterated that most east german marks which are 
virtually worthless must be traded at a 11 rate to the powerful 
west german mark when a single currency is created 
but the vice president of the west german central bank helmut 
schlesinger was quoted as saying a 11 exchange could lead to 
higher inflation in west germany 
de maiziere said he was concerned there was less willingness to 
help among west germans fearful that inflation and higher taxes may 
be the price for bailing out the collapsing east german economy 
we are not demanding sacrifices from you he said what we 
expect is togetherness and solidarity the division of germany can 
only be lifted by sharing 
de maiziere chosen as prime minister last week also said most 
of the remaining sections of the berlin wall would be torn down to 
symbolize the end of 40 years of oppression 
he said one piece would stand as a historical monument 
the wall and east germanys other border controls were opened in 
november during the prodemocracy revolt that toppled the former 
hardline communist regime 
he also said he expected the germanys would field a single team 
in the 1992 olympics 
de maiziere in a wideranging speech also sought to ease 
soviet objections to quick unification 
he said east germany now a member of the warsaw pact would 
protect the interests of the sovietled alliance when it negotiates 
unification 
he avoided direct reference to nato last week his coalition 
government said a unified germany could be part of the western 
military alliance until a new european security system is formed 
the soviet union opposes nato membership for a united germany 
but west german chancellor helmut kohl says the merged country must 
remain part of the alliance 
the west german television network zdf said wednesday that a 
letter from soviet officials to de maiziere outlined moscows 
opposition to quick unification because it would lead to rapid 
integration into nato 
de maiziere favors a form of unification in which the west 
german constitution would become the constitution of east germany 
some german politicans in both states favor a slower pace that 
would require a new constitution to be written

a film script about a private eye who joins 
forces with a former football star to solve a murder sold for a 
record 175 million 
the last boy scout could have fetched 2 million but 
28yearold screenwriter shane black said he preferred to sign with 
the david geffen co an independent producer he worked with 
previously 
its become almost routine to ask 1 million for prized 
screenplays in recent months but industry executives said 
tuesdays sale price far exceeded previous highs 
black who wrote lethal weapon declined to comment on his 
latest sale 
geffen who produced beetlejuice said he wanted the script 
because i can see a movie in it its not maybe a movie its 
definitely a movie and those arent easy to find 
a bidding war has broken out during the past year for spec 
scripts screenplays written without having been commissioned by 
a producer or studio 
the boom fed in part by a push by 20th century fox walt disney 
co and columbia pictures to expand their slates ended the 
300000 benchmark price for top scripts barely a year ago 
blacks script apparently attracted the studios because it is 
actionoriented and crafted well enough to lure a prominent 
director and actors and it promises to launch sequels 
fox opened the bidding at 850000 on monday the los angeles 
times reported thursday universal pictures dropped out when the 
price topped 1 million while warner bros and a partnership 
between tristar and carolco pictures continued in pursuit 
the partnership had bid 2 million by late tuesday before black 
chose geffen the times said 
some studio executives say script auctioning has become too 
costly 
to get 1 million it used to have to be a damned good script 
now you practically pay that for the idea alone and wind up with a 
lot of rewrites said david hoberman head of disneys touchstone 
unit which has stayed out of the auctions 
others like the change 
i dont know of anything that generates the excitement of the 
chase after a big script said john goldwyn executive vice 
president of worldwide production at mgmua communications co 
screenwriters increasingly are auctioning their work as the 
studios turn away from the development process in which executives 
pay writers to write and rewrite ideas discussed in advance 
about 83 percent of hollywood scripts sold last year were made 
by the development process down from 91 percent in 1986 according 
to partially complete figures from the writers guild of america 
west

yugoslavias two most liberal 
republics hold elections sunday whose results could jeopardize the 
countrys fragile federation 
in croatia more than 30 parties are vying for parliamentary 
seats in the republics first multiparty elections in 50 years 
in slovenia a centerright coalition advocating independence 
hopes to consolidate power by winning the republics presidency it 
already won legislative elections 
the coalitions candidate jose pucznik faces a tough battle 
against milan kucan kucan is a popular reform communist who won 
445 percent of the vote in the first round pucnik got 266 
percent in that vote 
in croatia surveys suggest the party for democratic change 
the reformed communist party is in the lead for the legislature 
but nearly a third of the voters are undecided according to the 
polls 
if proindependence forces win in both elections it could 
exacerbate the tension with serbia that threatens to pull apart the 
country yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous regions simmering with ethnic and ideological tensions 
slovenia and croatia already pushing for closer ties with the 
west would move further away from the hardline communist 
leadership of serbia it is the largest of yugoslavias republics 
and the only one besides montenegro still following a oneparty 
system 
croatia and slovenia have liberal judiciaries and media and 
their communist parties no longer consider their supremacy 
guaranteed in hardline serbia there is a strong communist 
influence in the press judiciary and all other aspects of life 
last week the communistdominated yugoslav military which has 
forged close ties with serbian leader slobodan milosevic warned it 
would prevent anticommunist parties in slovenia and croatia from 
assuming power 
franjo tudjman leader of the conservative croatian democratic 
union which wants radical reshaping of yugoslavia dismissed the 
statement as irrational and insane 
polls show tudjmans party in second place behind the reformed 
communists under tudjmans formula yugoslavias republics would 
be independent states that would establish relations only if common 
interests were involved 
the reform communists are more cautious they say the federation 
model is fine for now but if it fails to reflect the republics 
needs in the future yugoslavia should become a confederation 
without central rule 
the 66yearold tudjman once was the yugoslav armys youngest 
general but later spent almost five years in jail for 
counterrevolutionary activities his bid for power is fueling 
the fierce rivalry that has existed between serbia and croatia 
since yugoslavia was created in 1918 
serbias communists brand tudjman a fascist and a secessionist 
they have orchestrated several rallies of croatias 450000 serb 
minority which is haunted by memories of mass extermination in the 
croatian puppet state set up by nazi germany 
the serbs in croatia seek autonomy from the republic but all 
croatian parties oppose it 
tudjman is predicting victory but his two main rivals are also 
optimistic and appear unwilling to consider establishing a 
coalition with him if no party wins a majority 
mika tripalo a senior member of the coalition for national 
accord says tudjman is too extreme to win 
the coalition embraces five traditional croatian parties 
emerging for the first time since world war ii and almost a dozen 
other movements it has broad support 
tripalo wants some change in yugoslavias complex multiregional 
system for instance he said croatia cannot continue to spend 
vast sums on poorer regions such as serbias strifetorn province 
of kosovo 
but the coalition like the reformed communists stops short of 
advocating croatian independence both seek greater autonomy for 
the republics and a leaner federal government strictly limited to 
conducting foreign and defense policies 
ivica racan the party of democratic change leader who over the 
past six months has steered croatia to a multiparty democracy 
virtually rules out coalition with tudjman 
many voters are skeptical any party has the answer in a key area 
the economy 
all want to privatize property nationalized by the communists 
and introduce a market economy none says exactly how 
all their economic programs are vague consisting mainly of 
wishful thinking about the possibilities of huge infusions of 
foreign capital after the vote said economist tomica sohinger 
everybody seems to think that westerners have nothing better 
to do with their money than to give it to us he added

visitors to four of the countrys most popular 
national parks will be asked to recycle glass plastic and aluminum 
trash in a program sponsored by two chemical companies and the 
interior department 
recycling will start next month at great smoky mountains 
national park in north carolina and tennessee the first site of 
the recycling education program launched by dow chemical co 
huntsman chemical corp and the department 
acadia in maine and grand canyon in arizona will be added by 
june with plans to expand the program to californias yosemite by 
fall officials said they hoped eventually to add paper to the list 
of recycled materials 
it is time to recognize that recycling is a standard of good 
citizenship frank popoff chief executive officer of dow said 
at an openair news conference near the lincoln memorial 
bill snodgrass recycling project manager with dow said the 
first four parks were chosen for their volume of visitors a 
combined total of 18 million to 20 million a year 
its our best chance to reach the public he said we 
think americans are willing to recycle when we see people in a 
national park we think their environmental mood has to be 
fantastic 
park visitors will find special plastic bins in which to deposit 
aluminum glass and plastic trash popoff said its hoped that 
local entrepreneurs will start businesses to collect the materials 
haul them to nearby separation centers and sell them to recyclers 
where possible he said dow will arrange to have the recycled 
plastics converted and returned to the parks in the form of picnic 
tables park benches sign posts guard rails car stops and other 
products 
snodgrass said the program will cost the companies 500000 per 
park this year but the costs will decrease after the first 
startup year he said about 2 million pounds of recyclable waste 
should be recovered in the programs first year 
interior secretary manuel lujan said recycling has not been 
feasible in the past because of inadequate collection systems 
this is an experiment he said of the dowhuntsman project 
we think it will work we think its the answer 
both dow of midland mich and huntsman of salt lake city 
have inhouse recycling programs that company officials said save 
millions of dollars a year popoff said dows recycling practices 
reduce the companys wastes by 88 million pounds a year and saved 
30 million in 1988

the white house said today it had 
dispatched a hostage reception team to wiesbaden west germany 
after hearing statements of imminent release of an american 
hostage in lebanon 
but proiranian kidnappers in beirut said they have postponed 
the release because the united states failed to meet their demand 
to send a senior state department official to syria 
the handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture 
of robert polhill one of three us educators held by the group 
since jan 24 1987 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the release 
statements came from both the islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine which is holding several american hostages and from 
syria 
were hopeful this could be real fitzwater said as the 
president flew to florida for a meeting with french president 
francois mitterrand 
fitzwater said the state department had dispatched a reception 
team to wiesbaden where they have the medical facilities to 
receive any hostage that might be released 
we have statements of imminent release from islamic jihad and 
from syria fitzwater told reporters but he cautioned 
theres no way for us to know conclusively that its going to 
happen 
he said the hostage reception team has been sent there before on 
rumors of a hostage release that never happened 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine said on 
wednesday it would release one hostage this week it did not 
identify the hostage but the statement was accompanied by an 
instant photograph of jesse turner of boise idaho the group also 
holds alann steen and robert polhill 
fitzwater said the syrian government sent word through 
diplomatic channels wednesday that it appears a hostage would be 
released it is a little more significant that we have a 
statement from the syrian government but it by no means makes it a 
certainty he said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
the message from syria was the first official word to the us 
government that a hostage may be released 
she also ruled out any deals and said the united states had 
had no contact with iran directly or indirectly about the captive 
americans 
ms tutwiler said edward djerejian the us ambassador 
damascus had returned to his post in syria after attending a 
meeting of us diplomats in bonn west germany she said assistant 
secretary of state john kelly who also attended did not plan to 
goto syria as demanded by the islamic jihad 
eight americans are among the western hostages held in lebanon 
by proiranian groups the longestheld is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press kidnapped march 
16 1985 
turner steen and polhill were taken from the campus of beirut 
university college in beirut on jan 24 1987 
asked if the administration was concerned that sending kelly to 
damascus might be viewed as negotiating with terrorists fitzwater 
said we certainly dont want any question about negotiations to 
be raised by his going 
our position is that we want the unconditional release of all 
hostages we will not deal or negotiate for hostage release but 
were hopeful this could be real fitzwater said

cervical cancer deaths have dropped 11 percent in 
seven years but the death rates for black women remain more than 
twice as high as those for white women federal cancer specialists 
reported thursday 
the racial disparity is substantial and persistent the 
centers for disease control reported though black women may have 
surpassed white women in getting cervical cancer screening 
us deaths from cervical cancer dropped from 5537 in 1980 to 
4951 in 1987 the latest year for which detailed analysis is 
available the atlantabased agency said 
thats primarily from the increased use of screening said 
cdc cancer researcher eddas bennett virtually all cervical cancer 
deaths are preventable with early detection chiefly through pap 
test screening and treatment when necessary the cdc said 
overall annual cervical cancer death rates declined from 42 
deaths per 100000 women in 1980 to 34 in 1987 but while the 
rate among black women fell from 101 per 100000 in 1980 to 76 in 
1987 it remains more than twice the white rate which dropped from 
36 to 29 
the cdc attributed the racial disparity in death rates to 
generally lower socioeconomic status among blacks as well as a 
higher incidence rate of cervical cancer regardless of outcome 
preliminary cdc reports indicate that black women actually are 
more likely than whites to undergo cancerscreening pap smears 
a higher proportion of black women report having been 
screened the cdc said citing an unpublished study whose details 
are not yet publicly available 
lower screening rates for black women in previous years may be 
contributing now to higher death rates in older black women 
bennett said 
previously black women were screened less frequently than 
white women and it takes some years for it to catch up she said 
but for younger black women who were screened more frequently 
than their white counterparts disparities in followup and 
treatment may have contributed to excess cervical cancer 
mortality the cdc said 
if youre screened it often comes down to a question of 
whether you actually received the appropriate followup bennett 
said

the solidarity trade union under the gavel 
of chairman lech walesa launched its second national congress 
thursday celebrating its past triumphs while facing deep questions 
about its future 
in an emotional opening speech prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki invoked the memory of the unions long painful struggle 
to survive after the shock of martial law in 1981 
solidarity is alive poland is alive free and independent 
proclaimed the prime minister interrupted by cheers from the 487 
delegates 
walesa looked more to the future 
solidarity has had great achievements but expectations are 
even higher and we have to live up to them he told the congress 
before turning control of the meeting over to a 10member presidium 
the scheduled sixday meeting takes place in the same olivia 
sports hall where the union met for 18 stormy days in september and 
october 1981 
communist authorities declared military rule to crush solidarity 
only two months later forcing the union into an eightyear battle 
to regain legal status and worker rights 
the union finally triumphed at talks one year ago leading to 
the swift toppling of communist rule after elections in june 
within months communist monopolies were broken in the five other 
east bloc countries 
solidarity now faces new difficulties 
the union has managed to regain only 22 million of the 10 
million members it had in 1981 opinion polls show confidence in 
solidarity dropping as the public undergoes economic hardships 
associated with the strict austerity program pursued by 
mazowieckis solidaritycreated government 
economic restructuring is forcing plant closures and raising 
joblessness among the industrial workers who are the backbone of 
solidaritys support 
walesa meanwhile has criticized the pace of political reforms 
saying mazowieckis team is not moving quickly enough to dislodge 
communists from power in stateowned enterprises and government 
ministries 
before a backdrop upon which the red union solidarnosc logo 
was silkscreened walesa stood alone on the dais thursday morning 
and pounded his gavel three times to bring the congress to order 
delegates and hundreds of international guests and observers 
applauded with some union members raising their arms in the 
traditional solidarity vforvictory sign 
a symbolic procession of workers including blackuniformed 
miners in tall feathered caps and shipyard workers in blue 
worksuits and yellow hardhats took up positions on the side of 
the hall 
after leading the singing of the national anthem walesa 
announced that the congress had ended the underground and 
provisional phase of the unions activity 
he asked for a moment of silence for the people who died that 
we might live a dignified life 
during the congress the union will elect new leaders and accept 
a program for the future 
walesa appeared all but certain to win another term as chairman 
but rumors circulated that he would be challenged 
at least one solidarity region upper silesia is on record as 
proposing alternative candidates 
a draft prepared for the congress urges solidarity to 
concentrate more on traditional union issues while not resigning 
entirely from being a broadbased political movement 
one option to be discussed is creation of a separate solidarity 
political party 
the congress first day was mainly given over to ceremony 
procedural details and speeches from invited guests such as 
mazowiecki 
the prime minister whose economic policies are likely to come 
under harsh criticism at the congress stressed his roots in 
solidarity in an emotional speech to the congress 
i am one of you i remain one of you he said i want to 
remain faithful to this 
while acknowledging the difficult painful problems that have 
appeared unemployment hard living conditions mazowiecki 
called attention to signs of success for his economic policies 
including smothering of inflation and more goods in stores 
he said entirely free local elections scheduled across poland on 
may 27 will have a profound effect in increasing democracy in 
poland 
today he concluded 
we can say we have won this fight against totalitarianism and 
we shall will this fight for democracy 
as mazowiecki stepped away from the podium half the hall stood 
to applaud the other half remained seated until a smiling walesa 
went over to vigorously shake the prime ministers hand

the nations chief accident investigator asked 
on thursday for more power to examine mishaps on cruise ships that 
sail under foreign flags but work out of us ports and carry 
mostly americans 
complaining that international owners have thwarted efforts at 
investigating offshore accidents involving foreignflag cruise 
ships national transportation safety board chairman james l 
kolstad encouraged congress to expand the powers of us 
authorities 
had the scandinavian star been carrying hundreds of us 
passengers off the florida coast instead of europeans in the north 
sea neither the national transportation safety board nor the us 
coast guard would have been able to investigate this accident 
without the owners permission kolstad said 
kolstad was referring to the shipboard fire a more than a week 
ago in the north sea in which more than 160 people died 
the ntsb had investigated a major fire aboard the same ship two 
years ago in the gulf of mexico and identified some of the very 
problem areas survivors have reported this past week he told the 
house merchant marine subcommittee 
kolstad pointed to another thwarted effort at an offshore 
investigation the february 1989 collision between the celebration 
owned by miamibased carnival cruise lines and operating under 
liberian registry and a cuban bulk carrier 
not only cruise ships but also cargo ships operate under 
socalled flags of convenience such as those of panama or 
liberia allowing them to avoid higher taxes and wages the flag 
state rules govern the ship on the high seas while port 
state rules govern it within the port states territory 
but kolstad and members of congress say the burgeoning cruise 
industry has exploited the law of the seas critics say the 
businesses are american in everything except flag and many ships 
go on short excursions known as cruises to nowhere to escape 
onshore gambling laws 
unions are using the same argument to push for putting the crews 
of these ships under jurisdiction of us labor law 
opponents say that us efforts to extend regulation would 
violate longestablished international law and would drive cruise 
operators to base their ships in the bahamas and offer cheap 
flyandcruise packages 
kolstad argued that the international mechanism for addressing 
safety issues and accident investigations is too slow and 
cumbersome 
the united states is host nation to more than 80 percent of the 
worlds large passenger vessels some now capable of carrying 2600 
passengers 
coast guard rear admiral joel d sipes disputed kolstads 
assertions about the lack of international cooperation and said his 
agency prefers working within international agreements 
that is the experience that ntsb has had that we have not

proiranian kidnappers said thursday they 
postponed indefinitely the release of an american hostage because 
the united states refused to send a senior state department 
official to syria 
the announcement came in an arabiclanguage statement delivered 
by islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine it was delivered 
to the independent beirut newspaper annahar and a western news 
agency 
the handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture 
of robert polhill one of us educators held by the group since 
jan 24 1987 
the kidnappers on wednesday said john kelly us assistant 
secretary of state for near eastern affairs should fly to damascus 
to coordinate some final steps to guarantee success within 48 
hours they said a hostage would be freed within that time frame 
the white house refused to dispatch kelly doing so would either 
have engaged the united states in negotiations over the hostages or 
given that appearance a senior us official explained wednesday 
night 
the groups statement thursday reiterated the demand that kelly 
be sent to damascus 
as for the release of the american hostage arrangements had 
been under way on the basis that they would be concluded and 
finalized the statement said 
but kellys failure to respond has so far frustrated the 
release which made us postpone this operation until the picture is 
cleared it added 
the kidnappers said wednesday they were freeing one of the three 
americans in response to requests from iran and syria whose 
leaders have encouraged an end to the hostage crisis the group 
implied that some sort of exchange was involved 
on thursday morning white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the united states had dispatched a hostage reception team to west 
germany after hearing statements of imminent release of an 
american hostage 
the group did not say which of the three would be freed only 
that the release would occur within 48 hours or by friday evening 
that statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of jesse 
turner of boise idaho the first photo of him alone since three 
months after his abduction the group also holds alann steen 
steen polhill and turner were abducted from the campus of 
beirut university college on jan 24 1987 
turner 42 taught mathematics and computer science at beirut 
university polhill 55 of new york was a lecturer in accounting 
steen a journalism professor born in arcata calif and a former

the democraticcontrolled house budget 
committee on thursday approved a plan to slash president bushs 
defense spending proposal and shift billions of dollars to domestic 
programs 
the 124 trillion budget for fiscal 1991 was approved on a 
2114 partyline vote debate in the full house was scheduled for 
next week 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said there was 
good common sense behind the democratic version of the fiscal 
1991 budget he described it as a sharp departure from the status 
quo 
republicans portrayed the plan as an embodiment of the same old 
liberal democratic priorities with irresponsible defense cuts and 
loose reins on domestic spending but they expressed little 
concern calling the committee action just an early step in the 
long budget process 
we believe the sooner we get this exercise over the sooner 
we can actually begin writing the bill in bipartisan talks 
involving the president said rep bill frenzel of minnesota 
senior republican on the committee 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
president had no plans for a summit at this time on the budget 
the democratic budget envisions 295 billion in military 
spending next year about 1 billion less than in the current year 
and 8 billion less than requested by bush 
threefourths of the defense savings would be shifted 
immediately into domestic accounts that include medicaid food 
stamps education aids and antidrug abuse programs 
liberals on the committee failed thursday in their attempt to 
cut defense spending even further next year however they said 
they were satisfied with the longterm blueprint in the budget for 
squeezing the pentagon by 25 percent over the next five years 
the democratic budget is structured to force the pentagon to 
abandon procurement of expensive weapons systems although it 
avoids specifics the b2 stealth bomber is an obvious target 
the longterm focus also would help congress avert troop 
cutbacks before the november election 
the senate budget committee was scheduled to begin its 
budgetdrafting next week its chairman sen james sasser 
dtenn has suggested military spending be cut even more deeply 
next year than it would under the house plan 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga has 
balked at that suggestion 
the democratic defense cut proposal in the house is higher 
than mine would be but it is within the range of responsibility 
nunn said thursday he said he would submit his own figures late 
this week or early next week 
he proposed thursday that us troop strength in europe should 
be cut well below the 225000 baseline proposed by bush 
we should start planning on a residual force in europe on the 
order of 75000 to 100000 troops within five years he said in a 
speech 
in the house committee thursday democrats describe their fiscal 
blueprint as a turning point 
it recognizes the realities of a changing world in which our 
leadership will be tested not by the threat of nuclear war but by 
the challenge of reversing a legacy of debt and unmet needs within 
our society said budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
the defense number is the fulcrum of the budget said rep 
charles schumer dny 
republicans he said wanted to maintain it to fight the last 
war the new war we must fight is the economic war 
but republicans and some democrats criticized the plan for 
adding new domestic spending when federal deficits are still in the 
100 billion a year range 
if you liked the dukakis economic program youll love this 
budget said rep hal rogers rky 
the defense number is scary said rep jim mccrery rla 
why couldnt the peace dividend from defense cuts be 
translated into a deficit reduction dividend or a tax reduction 
dividend asked rep bill schuette rmich 
schuette also voted against bushs budget when it was defeated 
in committee when offered as a substitute to the democratic plan 
the democratic budget envisions 139 billion in new taxes next 
year the same amount requested by bush in his budget the plan 
does not specify where those revenues might be found and like bush 
the word taxes is avoided 
the taxes help the plan achieve its goal of reducing the federal 
deficit by about 36 billion next year the governments red ink 
would be reduced to about 64 billion as figured under the 
grammrudman budget law 
those figures include the surplus in the social security trust 
fund as part of the governments revenue stream but panetta said 
that even if that influx wasnt counted his committees plan would 
balance the budget by fiscal 1995 
sen pete v domenici of new mexico senior republican on the 
senate budget committee called thursday for a bipartisan budget 
summit to develop a major longterm plan to restore fiscal balance 
panetta sought to put the onus on the bush 
it would be in the best interest of the country if the 
president and the congress worked together to resolve their 
differences and develop a strong deficit reduction package he 
said 
in the absence of that kind of cooperation however the 
budget committee must proceed with the budget process

syrian soldiers tamed street battles 
between rival shiite militiamen thursday after four hours of 
fighting left four people dead and 10 wounded police said 
the syrians apparently were dispatched to prevent clashes from 
hindering the promised release of an american hostage held by a 
proiranian group later in the day however the group announced 
the release had been postponed 
the group islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
released a statement saying that the release of one of three 
american educators had been delayed by the united states refusal 
to send a senior state department official to syria the three 
americans were seized jan 24 1987 
also thursday israeli warplanes twice raided a tunnel complex 
used by syrianbacked palestinian guerrillas near a seaside village 
south of beirut two people were wounded 
the raids were launched three days after guerrillas in southern 
lebanon fired katyusha rockets into northern israel they exploded 
in a field and caused no casualties 
the syrian soldiers moved into the capitals western and 
southern zones to separate gunmen of the iranianbacked hezbollah 
or party of god and the syrianbacked amal militia about 12500 
syrian troops are stationed in beiruts moslem sector as a 
peacekeeping force 
the fighting had raised fears that it could jeopardize the 
hostages release most of the 18 westerners missing in lebanon 
including eight americans are believed held by groups linked to 
hezbollah in the southern slums a shiite stronghold 
tension resulting from intrashiite clashes could block 
efforts to release a hostage a police spokesman said speaking 
on condition of anonymity the syrian command is obviously keen 
on facilitating a hostage release 
the appearance of syrian patrols armed with automatic weapons 
machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades ended four hours of 
clashes between the rival factions 
for more than two years the two groups have fought sporadically 
for control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest 
sect 
the fighting flared after islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine issued its statement wednesday saying that it would 
release a hostage within 48 hours 
the kidnappers said the release would be in response to requests 
from iran and syria whose leaders have sought to end the hostage 
crisis hostages freed in beirut are usually taken by the syrians 
to damascus where they are handed to representatives of their 
governments 
the kidnappers statement wednesday did not name the hostage to 
be released it was accompanied by a photograph of captive jesse 
turner 42 of boise idaho 
turner a professor of mathematics and computer science was 
kidnapped with three colleagues from the usaffiliated beirut 
university college campus jan 24 1987 one of the educators 
nithileshwar singh was freed oct 3 1988 
the group also still holds journalism professor alann steen of 
boston who turns 51 sunday and robert polhill 55 an accounting 
lecturer from new york 
the hostage held the longest in lebanon is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was seized 
march 16 1985 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine threatened march 
15 to kill its three hostages unless the united states met 
unspecified demands it also threatened to attack airlines flying 
soviet jewish emigrants to israel 
the group previously offered to trade the professors for 400 
arab inmates held in israel the israelis rejected the swap 
the last american hostage released in lebanon was david 
jacobsen former director of the american university hospital in 
beirut he was kidnapped may 28 1985 by another proiranian 
shiite group islamic jihad or islamic holy war he was freed nov 
2 1986 under a clandestine armsforhostages deal between 
washington and tehran

scientists and teachers complained before a 
senate panel thursday that a bill created to boost math and science 
achievement fails to put enough money behind the ambitious goals 
the money is minuscule compared to the problem charles 
hollister marine geologist and vice president of an oceanographic 
center in woods hole mass told the senate labor and human 
resources committee 
none of us really can get too excited about cranking up our 
enthusiasm for something thats so small 
the bill the excellence in mathematics science and engineering 
education act recently was introduced by sens edward kennedy 
dmass and claiborne pell dri to help reach the national 
education goal of making america no 1 in math and science by the 
year 2000 
about 125 million would be pumped in increments of a few 
million dollars into wideranging programs designed to tackle a 
variety of problems in the disciplines as well as provide 
incentives to minorities and women 
hollister explained it takes as much as 30000 a year to train 
a graduate student just for stipend alone when the research 
costs are added in its between 250000 to 500000 just for 
one doctoral student 
my sense of the bill is that the blueprint is pretty good i 
was alarmed at the low numbers i dont think you could possibly 
have an impact with 2 million to 3 million with todays money 
especially with the goal being what it is he said estimating 
the appropriation should be closer to 1 billion 
shirley malcom of the american association for the advancement 
of science agreed that the size of the authorization is not on a 
scale with the size of the problem 
even if we assume that programs can be devised that have 
higher leverage over state local and private funds as well as the 
voluntary efforts of thousands the level of support currently 
proposed is not in keeping with the scale of the problem said 
ms malcom 
hans andersen president of the national science teachers 
association said the bill should double to about 10 million the 
amount slated to assess student achievement in each of the programs

the state department called on israelis on 
thursday to choose a government capable of saying yes to us 
proposals for negotiations with palestinian arabs 
its our view that progress at this point depends on the 
emergence of a government that is capable of making decisions and 
willing to move forward on peace spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said 
the statement reflected barely concealed resentment that prime 
minister yitzhak shamir had not pushed through a formula by 
secretary of state james a baker iii for negotiations 
israel has been in the throes of trying to form a new government 
to replace the ruling coalition headed by shamir that fell apart 
over the baker plan 
shamir objected to provisions for participation in the 
negotiations by palestinians expelled from the west bank or having 
had homes there 
the us has worked very hard to move the peace process 
forward ms tutwiler said reading from a prepared statement 
we have made important progress by getting to the point where 
palestinians from the territories were prepared to engage in a 
dialogue with israel about elections 
the us official added what is needed now to get to such a 
dialogue is for an israeli government to emerge that is capable of 
saying yes to the proposals put forward by secretary baker 
jerusalem said the statement portions of which were given to 
israeli reporters on wednesday was improper 
foreign ministry spokesman yosef amihud said usisraeli 
relations were characterized by a long tradition of 
noninterference in internal political processes 
the process of forming a new government is currently under way 
in israel it is therefore to be expected that another country be 
it as friendly as it may be will not interfere he added 
shamir who remains prime minister in a caretaker government 
was asked by reporters in jerusalem if he would accept the baker 
formula it is selfunderstood that i cannot say this he said 
meanwhile senate republican leader bob dole said thursday that 
a senate resolution recognizing jerusalem as israels capital has 
damaged middle east peace efforts and is an example of increasingly 
hasty actions by the chamber on sensitive matters 
these kinds of resolutions hastily prepared and even more 
hastily passed are nonsense dangerous nonsense and we ought to 
do something about it said dole who was one of 84 sponsors of 
the measure that was approved in march 
the state department meanwhile took another slap at the 
continuing settlement of jews on the west bank and in gaza 
ms tutwiler said it was disappointing that a leadership that 
was not prepared to go forward on peace would be prepared to take 
steps on settlements which in our view make it more difficult to 
develop a meaningful peace process 
at the same time the state department praised a ruling by an 
israeli court ordering the ouster of jews who had moved into a 
building complex in the christian quarter of jerusalem 
we are pleased that the court has so promptly made its 
decision ms tutwiler said we believe it would be in the best 
interest of reducing tensions for this matter to be concluded as 
quickly as possible 
however the state department declined to follow the lead of the 
carter administration and declare settlements on land held by the 
arabs from 1948 to 1967 to be illegal 
us policy calls on israel to withdraw from the west bank and 
from gaza as part of an overall settlement that would involve arab 
recognition of the jewish state

police arrested five teenagers and charged them 
with starting a fire at a tire dump that burned for 17 days 
spewing toxic smoke into the air and forcing 600 people from their 
homes officials said thursday 
the teenagers ranging in age from 15 to 17 were arrested 
thursday and late wednesday police said the young offenders act 
prohibits disclosing the identitities of those charged 
the arrests were made after tips from the public police in 
ontario said on condition of anonymity 
investigators had said arson was the cause of the fire at tyre 
king recycling the dump is in hagersville 12 miles north of lake 
erie and 60 miles north of erie ohio 
the fire fed by 14 million tires broke out early feb 12 
forcing the evacuation of hundreds living in a twomile radius 
around the blaze 
the environment ministry declared tyre king ontarios largest 
tire dump an illegal waste site in december 1985 
the fire was initially described as a major environmental 
disaster and officials had feared the oily runoff created by the 
melted tires might have contaminated drinking water in local wells 
but experts said recently that damage from both the oil and 
smoke was less than had been expected

an autopsy indicated that he had suffocated on his own blood after 
ripping a tracheal tube from his throat while waiting for a cat 
scan 
but pathologists hired by archies family said their autopsies 
found little blood in archies lungs and a great deal of evidence 
that he had been beaten to death he had a cracked skull a crushed 
larynx a shattered face and had been hit too many times to count 
said attorney mary howell 
an autopsy also was performed for the fbi but us attorney 
john volz has said results cannot be released while the

attorney general dick thornburgh said thursday 
that his chief spokesman unintentionally confirmed to a reporter 
that there was a criminal investigation involving rep william h 
gray iii 
thornburgh said press secretary david runkel was following my 
standing instruction not to mislead the media when he did not 
steer cbs reporter rita braver off the story last spring 
the attorney general who launched a criminal investigation of 
the unauthorized disclosure of the investigation said runkels 
failure to deny information ms braver had obtained from other 
sources was not misconduct 
a refusal to deny or wave a reporter off a story with which he 
is confronted by the reporter does not in my view constitute 
misconduct thornburgh said in a statement 
unfortunately there are circumstances where a statement of the 
kind likely made here by mr runkel may be used by a reporter as 
confirmation of a story thornburgh said 
a real distinction must be made i believe between an 
unsolicited and affirmative unauthorized disclosure and such a 
confirmation by one responsible for dealing with the media 
thornburgh said 
the cbs story aired while gray dpa was seeking election as 
house majority whip produced a storm of indignation from democrats 
in congress who accused the justice department of a politically 
inspired leak 
the justice department took pains a few days later to correct 
the impression left by the cbs story that gray was under 
investigation in an unusual statement thornburghs office said 
the pennsylvania democrat was not a target of the investigation 
the attorney general who is in mexico attending a drug 
enforcement conference issued the statement in response to a story 
published thursday in the new york times which also said that 
runkel failed a lie detector test during the leak investigation 
department spokesman daniel eramian who read the statement to 
reporters refused to comment on the times account of the lie 
detector test 
but runkel who was traveling with thornburgh and unavailable 
for comment has previously refused to say whether he was one of 
the 10 people who took polygraph tests during the leak 
investigation 
runkel has acknowledged that he testified before a grand jury 
about the case 
under routine investigative procedures a subject who fails a 
polygraph test is summoned for questioning before a grand jury 
thornburgh has been an outspoken opponent of unauthorized leaks 
about pending criminal investigations making it a hallmark of his 
tenure as attorney general 
the attorney general has repeatedly cited the gray leak as an 
egregious example 
eleven fbi agents who conducted the leak investigation took 
sworn statements from 109 people 
in a letter to congress in december thornburgh reported that 
investigation has not produced sufficient evidence to enable me 
to ascertain that any present employee of the department of justice 
was responsible for the disclosure 
i have determined that no termination of employment or other 
disciplinary action is justified in this matter at this time the 
attorney general had said in his letter to congress

norway said thursday that lithuania is free 
to buy its oil but it urged moscow to lift an energy embargo 
against the baltic republic before outside supplies are needed 
a lithuanian delegation led by prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene sought support from norwegian leaders but there were no 
immediate contracts or offers of government aid said foreign 
minister kjell magne bondevik 
norway has not used and will not use oil as a foreign policy 
tool bondevik said adding that it was up to the oil companies 
to decide whether to sell to lithuania 
the oslo trip planned weeks ago coincided with the decision by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to close the tap of crude oil 
and restrict natural gas supplies to lithuania for refusing to 
scrap proindependence laws 
we were expecting this mrs prunskiene said when told by 
reporters of the cutback on natural gas we believe lithuania 
will survive without natural gas but life will be reduced cut off 
from normal possibilities 
norway pumps 15 million barrels a day from north sea fields 
making it the secondlargest exporter outside the opec oil cartel 
it also exports natural gas but it has no way to deliver it to 
lithuania 
bondevik said he summoned soviet ambassador alexandre teterine 
to express norways opposition to the use of economic pressure to 
thwart lithuanias independence drive 
he said norway favored flexibility by both moscow and lithuania 
and urged negotiations without pressure or preconditions before 
the conflict threatened eastwest relations 
in the talks with mrs prunskiene we made it clear that the 
lithuanians are free to contact the suppliers of petroleum he 
said we will not step in much less hinder this 
the state oil company statoil has said it was willing to sell 
oil to lithuania at market prices for hard currency but lithuania 
has little hard currency a second potential supplier is norsk 
hydro company which is 51 percent stateowned 
mrs prunskiene said she hoped to meet with directors of both 
companies friday she said she did not expect to secure future 
supplies during the threeday visit but to establish contacts that 
might lead to later contracts she said lithuania also would need 
credit 
she acknowledged that the soviet navy could easily blockade 
lithuanias harbors but said it would be an unthinkable thing if 
the soviet union stops oil delivery from other sources 
after meeting bondevik teterine said moscow would handle the 
question if it arises of norway supplying lithuania but he noted 
recent legal reforms allowing the baltic republics to deal with 
their own economic affairs 
perhaps it is up to the leadership of each republic to decide 
on how they will get petroleum supplies and sell their products 
he said 
mrs prunskiene said the energy squeeze would not force the 
republic to withdraw its march 11 declaration of independence 
there is no question of retreating from our position she 
said the fate of lithuania will to a high degree define the 
future of western europe 
her visit put prime minister jan p syses government in the 
awkward position of being in front of its nato allies in responding 
to the lithuanian crisis syse has been under pressure from 
opponents on the left and right to come to lithuanias aid even at 
the risk of rousing moscows ire 
the lithuanians came to norway at the invitation of the three 
parties in the ruling coalition to discuss political ideology not 
aid syse insisted he met the delegation in his role as 
conservative party chairman rather than head of government 
the lithuanian delegation flew from the republics capital to 
moscow on the soviet carrier aeroflot then transferred to another 
aeroflot flight for a flight to copenhagen denmark in copenhagen 
they then boarded a scandinavian airlines system airplane and flew 
on to oslo

a new jetliner full of passengers flew 
intentionally too close to a small plane on thursday in a 
demonstration of the first collisionavoidance system to be 
approved for a commercial airliner fleet 
in a change that the airline industry says will cost it nearly 
1 billion airlines must install the traffic alert and collision 
avoidance system tcas ii in all their large jets before the end 
of 1993 
climb climb climb said an emphatic male voice generated 
by the tcas ii built into the first of 100 usair jetliners to be 
equipped this year 
a small screen in the cockpit showed a red dot indicating that 
another plane was dangerously close 
with a series of maneuvers between the small plane and the 
boeing 737400 carrying industry and government officials and 
several reporters and photographers pilots demonstrated the tcas 
ii system 
congress has ordered that onefifth of each carriers airliners 
must have the tcas ii units installed before the end of this year 
at a cost of about 125000 each 
the bill for the whole us fleet is expected to exceed 450 
million airlines put the cost at closer to 1 billion figuring in 
labor and lost profits during installation which takes about five 
days 
smaller passenger planes are required to have a less 
sophisticated version tcas i which emits traffic warnings when 
other planes come too near but does not tell the pilot what to do 
time after time the small plane came on a collision course with 
the usair jet each time the tcas screen showed the location of 
the intruding aircraft and a voice from a speaker in the cockpit 
ceiling gave quick precise instructions to the pilot beginning 
with traffic and ending with clear of conflict as 
passengers watched the small plane whiz by within a few hundred 
feet of the airliner 
if two tcas computers meet in the sky they communicate with 
each other and one pilot is told to climb and the other to 
descend said ace card bendixking program manager for tcas 
an even more sophisticated third generation of the system tcas 
iii is being developed to give pilots horizontal instructions as 
well 
honeywell has been testing such a system on an faa airliner but 
it is not expected to be approved for installation on commercial 
planes for several years 
the tcas system gives the pilot a miniature air traffic control 
system in the sky showing aircraft within a 40mile radius it can 
only detect planes with transponders that emit radar signals all 
but the smallest private planes have them 
usair officials said their 737 is the first commercial airplane 
to be equipped and certificated by the faa with the tcas unit 
northwest united and piedmont each equipped a plane with test 
versions of tcas when the system was being evaluated by the faa 
three companies manufacture tcas systems that meet faa 
specifications the ones being put on usairs fleet are made by 
alliedsignal aerospaces bendixking air transport avionics 
division 
other manufacturers are the air transport systems division of 
honeywell inc and the collins divisions of rockwell international 
the system was required as an added measure of safety for air 
travelers 
tom mcsweeney an faa official who was on the demonstration 
flight said the system would have the added benefit of making it 
easier for pilots to maintain proper separation from other aircraft 
during landings and giving them more information when they are in 
areas not covered by air traffic controllers 
the system however is seen only as a backup to faa controllers 
who monitor all flights and have responsibility for maintaining 
safe distances between aircraft particularly those the pilots 
cannot see out of the cockpit window

a vaccine created by a pharmaceutical 
company appears to protect human immune cells from infection by the 
aids virus when the cells are in mice but a yale researcher 
cautions it may not work with people 
the vaccine called vaxsyn hiv1 was developed by microgenesys 
inc of west haven 
it has been able to defend human immune cells transplanted into 
specially bred mice while mice injected with cells from 
unvaccinated people were vulnerable to the virus officials at the 
company said wednesday 
the company said tests on people could begin soon 
dr anthony s fauci director of the national institutes of 
health aids program called the vaccine potentially a very 
important finding the test is the first evidence of protective 
immunity in humans he said 
francis black professor of epidemiology and microbiology at the 
yale school of medicine called the experiment ingenious 
saying it marks an important step toward a vaccine to prevent 
infection by the deadly virus 
but he cautioned that it does not prove that the microgenesys 
vaccine will work in people 
in humans there would be other cells that doubtless play a 
role in the progress of aids black said there are a lot of 
other differences between mice and men 
the experiment was designed to test the vaccine on cells living 
in mice to avoid the danger of infecting healthy people 
the microgenesys vaccine is composed of the outer protein coat 
of the aids virus it is made by altering the genes of caterpillar 
cells to make the protein which by itself is not dangerous or 
infectious 
franklin volvovitz president of microgenesys said healthy test 
subjects were first injected with the vaccine a type of 
infectionfighting white blood cell then was taken from the people 
and transplanted into mice bred to lack a strong immune system 
after the human immune cells called peripheral blood 
leukocytes grew in the mice the rodents were exposed to the aids 
virus volvovitz explained 
in one test 11 of the 12 mice tested were protected against the 
virus volvovitz said however all the mice given white blood 
cells from volunteers not injected with the vaccine succumbed to 
the aids virus 
the study which was reported at a symposium on acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in colorado earlier this month was performed 
at the medical biology institute in la jolla calif a nonprofit 
laboratory funded by the federal government 
black said many scientists consider an aids vaccine impossible 
because of the complex ways in which the virus and the human immune 
system work 
i remain very optimistic that a vaccine will be developed 
he said i think they microgenesys are fairly close to a 
clinical trial 
the vaccine probably would be given to members of a population 
at high risk for aids and then rates of the disease would be 
analyzed black said 
the study would be complicated and expensive because it would 
require participation of large numbers of people he said 
the vaccine is being tested both as a measure to prevent 
infection by the aids virus and as a treatment for those already 
infected

the bush administration told congress on 
thursday that the us trade deficit after narrowing for the last 
two years could worsen in 1990 and an administration official said 
japan must do more to lower its huge trade surplus 
treasury undersecretary david mulford said japans closed 
markets pose important risks for the world economy and added 
that nations such as japan need to protect the trading system from 
protectionist onslaughts 
clearly japan has not done its part mulford told a senate 
banking subcommittee reviewing a new administration report on the 
outlook for world trade in 1990 
the report said any improvement in the trade deficit would be 
at very best modest and there was a distinct possibility the 
deficit could actually widen this year 
the report which the treasury department must prepare under the 
1988 trade law noted that the dollar has risen in value against 
the japanese yen by almost 20 percent over the last year 
a stronger dollar threatens to widen the trade deficit by making 
us goods less competitive on overseas markets and allowing 
foreign producers to lower prices to american consumers 
sen alan dixon dill said that executives of the caterpillar 
company had told him that all their efforts to improve their 
international competitiveness had been wiped out by the recent 
currency changes 
if the yen keeps falling against the dollar i dont see how 
our trade performance can be improved dixon said 
mulford said that the weakness of the yen was of a concern to 
the united states and its allies in the group of seven japan 
west germany britain france italy and canada and would be a 
primary topic on the agenda when the group next meets in early may 
in washington 
however sen paul sarbanes dmd questioned whether the g7 
countries would be able to come up with any stronger coordinated 
effort to stabilize currency rates than the bland statement issued 
when the group met earlier this month in paris 
mulford said that while exchange rates should be monitored he 
believed it was more important mow for the united states to push 
ahead with its efforts to dismantle japans structural barriers to 
foreign products including american goods 
simply depreciating the dollar against the yen is not going to 
do what is necessary to solve the usjapan trade deficit he 
said 
the bush administration has been seeking to remove a variety of 
japanese trade barriers the broadest effort involves the 
structural impediments initiative aimed at eliminating broadbased 
barriers to trade

proiranian kidnappers today indefinitely 
postponed the release of an american hostage because the united 
states failed to meet their demand to send a senior state 
department official to syria 
president bush said this afternoon in response to the news that 
the united states has been disappointed before by dashed hopes 
for the release of us hostages in lebanon and repeated he will 
not meet the demands of kidnappers 
the announcement of the postponement came in an arabiclanguage 
statement delivered by islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine to the independent beirut newspaper annahar and a 
western news agency 
the handwritten statement was accompanied by an instant picture 
of robert polhill one of three us educators held by the group 
since jan 24 1987 
the kidnappers had said wednesday that they would freeing one of 
the three american educators within 48 hours or by friday evening 
the other two are jesse turner and alann steen 
the group had said that it was acting in response to requests 
from iran and syria whose leaders have encouraged an end to the 
hostage crisis the group implied that some sort of exchange was 
involved 
bush in key largo fla told a news conference i would add 
that we are not talking to the hostageholders 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine had demanded 
that john kelly us assistant secretary of state for near eastern 
affairs fly to damascus to coordinate some final steps leading 
to the release 
it did not specify what they expected of kelly the us 
ambassador to lebanon from 1983 to 1988 he was in bonn west 
germany on wednesday 
secretary of state james a baker iii had cautiously welcomed 
the reports but said kelly had no plans to fly to the middle east 
at the present time 
as for the release of the american hostage arrangements had 
been under way on a basis that they would be concluded and 
finalized but kellys failure to respond has so far frustrated the 
release which made us postpone this operation until the picture is 
clearerd todays statement said 
although the bush administration refused to send kelly it 
dispatched a hostage reception team to west germany after hearing 
statements of imminent release of an american hostage the 
white house said 
the latest statement reiterated a threat the group made last 
month to attack jetliners airlines and airports used to transport 
soviet jewish emigrants to israel 
the organization serves this final warning on all those 
participating in this matter especially those countries offering 
transit facilities the statement said 
this is the last warning all civilians should stay away from 
the airports airlines and jetliners that will be the targets for 
operations mounted at times we deem adequate 
earlier today shiite militiamen clashed in west beirut and the 
citys southern slums prompting fears that that would delay the 
hostage release 
many of the 18 western hostages in lebanon including eight 
americans are believed held in south beirut 
police in beirut said foot patrols of syrias 12500strong 
force in the citys moslem sector moved in to contain the fighting 
between the proiranian hezbollah and syrianbacked amal 
you cant expect a hostage to be freed in such risky 
conditions a police spokesman said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
also israeli warplanes attacked palestinian guerrilla bases 10 
miles south of beirut targeting tunnel bases manned by guerrillas 
of capt ahmed jibrils popular front for the liberation of

the agriculture department said thursday a 
food company in puerto rico is voluntarily recalling three canned 
turkey products because food spoilage organisms had been found in 
one of the products 
all of the suspected food was said to have been distributed to 
schools and other institutions in puerto rico there was no 
estimate of the quantity of products distributed 
the department said federal packing co inc of carolina pr 
also reports the isolation of the bacterium clostridium botulinum 
in samples of its products tested by a private laboratory 
according to usda references these organisms can cause 
botulism a deadly form of food poisoning 
the food spoilage organisms were detected when the departments 
food safety and inspection service tested some of the companys 
canned boned turkey in bouillon officials said no botulinum was 
detected by usda but the agency said it is continuing the tests 
both of the products were produced for the puerto rico 
department of education and were distributed to public and private 
schools churches charitable organizations and the head start 
program in puerto rico 
the products are not officially distributed in us locations 
outside of puerto rico the announcement said

seal on the label and the wording packed for ajm meat packing 
inc appears on the bottom of the label 
ronald j prucha associate administrator of the departments 
food safety and inspection service said there have been reports 
of seven unconfirmed illnesses that may have been associated with 
consumption of the canned boned turkey in bouillon

the united states plans to withdraw more than 
12000 of its troops in asia over the next three years and 
additional cuts are possible as the soviet threat diminishes 
administration officials said thursday 
paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense for policy detailed 
the planned changes in us forces as he presented a report 
required by congress on military strategy in the pacific 
the report reiterated many of the proposals defense secretary 
dick cheney unveiled in february during his twoweek visit to the 
pacific rim 
under the administration plan 10 percent of the 120000 
american forces based in asia would be withdrawn some 7000 
military personnel of the 44000 us forces in korea and 5000 to 
6000 of the 50000 in japan 
since our forward deployments have been most commonly 
justified as a deterrent to soviet expansionism our presence in 
the region is now seen as less relevant in light of domestic 
changes with the soviet union and prospects for ussoviet arms 
control negotiations the report said 
it said further reductions could be considered in later years 
however the report stresses threats to us economic and 
political interests in the pacific remain despite the dramatic 
changes overseas 
the communist government of north korea is still pursuing 
reunification with south korea and in other southeast asian nations 
us interests are vulnerable to terrorism 
our deterrence posture and forward presence in east asia have 
been successful and it remains in our interest to maintain a 
forward deployed strategy including a military presence on the 
korean peninsula and elsewhere in east asia and the western 
pacific the report said 
the united states will also push for asian nations to share a 
larger portion of the financial burden for defense 
in his meeting with japanese officials in february cheney 
sought increases in the 24 billion annual support toward the 7 
billion cost of the american deployment in japan 
it is appropriate to expect our prosperous asian allies 
japan and korea to assume greater responsibility for their own 
defense and by so doing to contribute more directly to the 
stability of the region the report said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services panel 
stressed the need for the us allies to foot more of the defense 
bill and noted the strong congressional support for such action 
i believe that almost everybody i know on capitol hill both 
political parties believes south korea ought to contribute more 
to offset nunn said 
wolfowitz said south korea has tripled its defense budget in 
recent years allowing the united states to consider reductions

the farm price of milk has dropped sharply 
from the record highs of last winter but consumers may have to 
wait a while longer to see much effect an agriculture department 
report said thursday 
analysts said there are conflicting indications of the 
supplydemand balance in the dairy markets 
milk production has resumed expansion and falling 
international prices of nonfat dry milk have demolished 
opportunities for commercial exports the report said 
but domestic demand has been strong both commercially and to 
rebuild depleted inventories 
milk prices at the farm probably will slip in the coming months 
and the onset of seasonal increases may be delayed the report 
said overall the farm price of milk in 1990 may average 4 percent 
to 9 percent below last years allmilk price of 1351 per 
hundredweight 
consumer prices of dairy products as a group in early 1990 had 
risen more than 10 percent from a year earlier greatly exceeding 
the overall increases in retail food and consumer prices 
retail dairy prices probably will trend down in coming months 
although any signs of strength in wholesale prices will tend to 
lessen and delay retail price declines the report said

czechoslovakia restored diplomatic relations 
with the vatican on thursday sweeping away a remnant of 40 years 
of churchstate hostility before a historic papal visit this 
weekend 
czechoslovakia joined a growing list of eastern european 
countries forging ties with the holy see in an expansion of the 
churchs influence in the once communistdominated region 
the prague government interrupted diplomatic relations in march 
1950 when it gave the papal envoy three days to leave the country 
said the vatican in a statement 
the vatican hailed the resumption of ties as bringing an end to 
the sad parenthesis of these last 40 years 
pope john paul iis visit saturday and sunday to czechoslovakia 
will be his first to a warsaw pact country other than his native 
poland 
the trip symbolizes everything that has happened in the 
countries of what is by now the excommunist world said the 
vatican newspaper losservatore romano 
under a succession of hardline communist regimes that ruled 
until czechoslovakias peaceful revolution last november such a 
visit was unthinkable 
as elsewhere in the soviet bloc organized religion in 
czechoslovakia was rigidly controlled believers were repressed and 
religious education was severely restricted 
in his inauguration speech dec 29 president vaclav havel who 
had been jailed by the communist regime asked the pope to visit 
prague as a goodwill gesture to support the democratic changes 
sweeping eastern europe 
poland last year reestablished diplomatic relations with the 
vatican followed by hungary in february a month ago the vatican 
and the soviet union established official ties for the first time 
since the russian revolution although they fall short of full 
diplomatic relations 
the vatican has also restored the leadership of the church in 
romania and diplomatic ties with bucharest are believed not far off 
the announcement at the vatican and in prague said relations 
were being renewed on the level of a czechoslovak embassy and an 
apostolic nunciature 
the envoys were not immediately named 
the vatican estimates that a little more than half of 
czechoslovakias 155 million people are roman catholics 
on several occasions john paul had deplored the sad state 
of the church in czechoslovakia where up to 10 of the countrys 13 
dioceses were left without bishops the church is led by 
90yearold cardinal frantisek tomasek who long struggled for 
church freedoms 
soon after the regime led by milos jakes was toppled relations 
with rome warmed in recent months the vatican has returned the 
church hierarchy to full strength 
millions of catholics are expected to attend the papal events in 
prague the shrine city of velehrad and bratislava during the 
twoday visit the first by a pope to czechoslovakia 
the trip will be the 46th foreign tour of john pauls papacy 
trips by john paul to poland and hungary are scheduled next year

two major japanese electronics firms said thursday 
they will increase their purchases of foreign products to reduce 
trade friction with the united states 
the government also adopted a new set of procedures for 
procurement of supercomputers by staterun agencies and 
universities and said it would open talks with washington on 
amorphous metals another contentious trade issue 
sony corp and matsushita electric industrial co said they will 
boost their purchases of foreignmade semiconductors from 14 
percent and 13 percent respectively to 20 percent by next year 
matsushita sells under the national panasonic and quasar brand 
names 
we are making an earnest effort by setting the 20 percent 
target sony spokesman koichi izukura said 
sony will allow foreign chip makers to develop more 
semiconductors for future products starting at the product design 
stage izukura said 
us semiconductor makers have complained that they frequently 
are not given information by japanese companies about future 
products that would allow them to design new computer chips for 
those products 
sony uses 20002500 types of new chips each year in its audio

be developed for new products izukura said 
in 1986 the united states and japan set a goal for the foreign 
share of the japanese chip market to be 20 percent by july 1991 
foreign chips accounted for 129 percent of the market during the 
last three months of 1989 
meanwhile nissan motor co japans secondlargest automaker 
said it will increase its chip imports to a level higher than its 
import target for fiscal 1992 of 740 million 
nissan said as a result of meetings with 26 us parts suppliers 
this month it would place orders for 53 items made by the 
suppliers it did not identify the companies 
in supercomputer trade us officials say japan discriminates 
against foreign suppliers because purchasing procedures are unclear 
and japanese makers are allowed to sell at sharply lower academic 
discounts 
the new procedures include a ban on unfair academic discounts 
and shorten the period for procurement to 130 days from 180 days 
an official in the prime ministers office said 
the new process will be implemented may 1 said the official

climbing toward your home wearing hardhats welders jackets and 
chainsawproof leggings and carrying badminton rackets 
if youre a great horned owl you back off thats what a pair 
of tree service men arrayed in that manner discovered as they 
climbed warily to an owls nest to offer them up an orphan owl 
found on the ground 
an owl has to be brought up where it can see other owls 
otherwise it thinks its a human and can never be released said 
sherri smith a volunteer who found the new nest atop a 60foot 
white oak in scio township 
the adoptive father wasnt around and the mother flew away as 
brad burton owner of an ann arbor tree service and employee bill 
guy scaled the tree tuesday afternoon to place the baby owl in its 
new home 
a canadian wildlife authority had warned that adult owls might 
attack humans venturing near the nest so burton and guy brought 
along all the protective garb they could find not to mention the 
badminton rackets

ground where it was put in a sack and hoisted back home the 
second time it stayed 
and on wednesday smith said a telescope caught up with the 
mother and two babies all three were preening their feathers and 
happy in the sun so everything is fine

city health officials hope an inquiry into the 
denver coroners office will end controversy that developed after 
lawyers questioned autopsy findings in the deaths of three children 
we are going to try to do what we can as soon as possible so 
we can put to sleep the rumors and unanswered questions said vi 
swenson chairwoman of the board of the denver department of health 
and hospitals 
i cant say weve drawn a conclusion certainly there are some 
questions that have to be answered but i cant say there is 
something wrong in the coroners office swenson said wednesday 
certainly there may be some things that people are not 
comfortable with 
mayor federico pena on wednesday ordered the board of the 
department of health and hospitals to investigate the office after 
attorneys and medical experts raised questions about the competence 
of dr robert deters of loveland who has been under contract to 
perform autopsies for denver 
in the past year the coroners office operated without a 
fulltime pathologist turning its work over to deters who 
performed 390 autopsies for denver in 10 months 
in addition deters has carried a full load of responsibilities 
as head of the pathology department at mckee medical center in 
loveland in that capacity he has done 110 autopsies in the past 
16 months 
the national association of medical examiners recommends that a 
coroner carry an annual caseload of 250 
in the past month prosecutors and defense attorneys concerned 
about deters competence have sought second opinions in three 
childdeath cases 
a 16monthold boy died jan 17 at a hospital three days after 
he was admitted exhibiting what doctors said were symptoms of 
having been hit on the ear the boyfriend of the childs mother was 
arrested for investigation of childabuse charges but released 
after deters ruled the boy died of complications from an ear 
infection the district attorneys office requested a second 
opinion 
a 2yearold child died in august after falling in his home 
deters ruled there was no evidence of foul play and police closed 
an investigation of childabuse allegations the district attorney 
requested a second opinion 
a 2monthold boy died feb 6 and his mother is accused of 
starving him to death a public defender sought a second opinion 
after criticizing the coroners office for withholding autopsy 
reports and failing to perform required tests 
in addition a defense attorney has challenged deters findings 
in the case of a 13monthold fort collins girl who was fatally 
beaten in august 1988 the attorney claims deters authorized the 
removal of the victims organs before vital tests were done 
at a news conference wednesday officials at the denver 
coroners office defended deters saying he provided competent 
highquality work during a crisis at the office 
deters too stood by his work 
i worked hard i put in some long hours i dedicated 
however much time was required to do the job thoroughly he said 
people have alleged shortcuts were taken no shortcuts were 
taken the job was done right

president bush said thursday he declined 
to send a senior state department official to syria as demanded by 
the holders of an american hostage because the united states does 
not knuckle under to demands 
we have a perfectly capable accredited diplomat on the scene 
in syria the president said 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine cited us 
refusal to send john kelly assistant secretary of state for middle 
eastern affairs as the reason for not releasing one of three 
hostages held by the group in lebanon 
the group had said it wanted kelly to coordinate some final 
steps for the release 
speaking to reporters after his meeting with french president 
francois mitterrand bush said he had not heard of the kelly 
connection to the kidnappers refusal 
we are not talking to the hostage holders the president 
said 
we do not meet demands our ambassador to syria is back in 
syria we have been disappointed before hopes raised only to have 
them dashed by excessive speculation he said 
bush said he was grateful to syria for trying to play a 
constructive role in the matter 
a reporter said france had been more successful in gaining 
freedom for its hostages and asked bush whether the two presidents 
had discussed that bush turned the question over to mitterrand 
after saying the matter had been discussed by staff members 
the freeing of the hostages in the early period in 1988 took 
place in somewhat different circumstances and under different 
conditions the french president said each individual case of 
hostages is in fact a different and separate case 
the kidnappers said on wednesday they would free one of the 
three american educators they are holding within 24 hours or by 
friday evening the three are robert polhill jesse turner and 
alann steen but the kidnappers did not say who was to be released 
the group said at the time that it was acting in response to 
requests from iran and syria whose leaders have encouraged an end 
to the hostage crisis 
it did not specify what they expected of kelly the us 
ambassador to lebanon from 1983 to 1988 he was in bonn west 
germany on wednesday 
as for the release of the american hostage arrangements had 
been under way on a basis that they would be concluded and 
finalized but kellys failure to respond has so far frustrated the 
release which made us postpone this operation until the picture is 
clearer said a statement thursday from the group

ladybugs honey bees and crickets are 
dropping like flies in medflyinfested regions of southern 
california soaked in pesticide leaving gardeners to battle aphids 
thriving with their natural enemies gone 
its gross its sickening said san gabriel valley 
homeowner peggy watson whose orange trees are covered with aphids 
frustrated gardeners are making a bee line for pesticide shelves 
at nurseries and garden centers where there has been a run on 4 
tubes containing 1000 ladybugs 
we have people calling us up asking to reserve ladybugs 
said henrick mar manager of the san gabriel nursery 
pesticides sprayed by helicopters were intended to rid the 
region of the mediterranean fruit fly 
the medfly thought to enter the country in illegally imported 
fruit threatens part of the states 16 billion a year farm 
economy because it feeds on and lays eggs in more than 200 
varieties of cash crops 
gov george deukmejian said thursday there was no alternative to 
spraying he said it would continue despite vocal protests and 
attempts by municipalities to stop what they view as a potential 
health menace 
the department of agriculture is pursuing what is a 
timetested method of eradicating the medfly deukmejian told 
reporters we cannot give up on this we have to eradicate it 
deukmejian said if eradication efforts fail there will be higher 
food prices quarantines on california fruit by foreign 
governments loss of jobs and even placement of maggotinfested 
fruit on supermarket shelves 
the blossomdevouring aphid has flourished because the pesticide 
malathion has killed off its predators ladybugs lacewings and 
tiny wasps they have been all but eliminated within the nearly 400 
square miles of quarantine and spray zones 
wild honeybees which pollinate fruit trees also have fallen 
victim to malathion spraying its as if they drop dead in 
midflight said watson 
medfly spraying also has robbed spring of one of its traditional 
sounds the chirping of crickets 
aphids leafscales and whiteflies survive the sprayings because 
they live close to petals or beneath leaves shielding them from 
the pesticide droplets 
malathion spraying causes an imbalance said lester ehler 
an entomologist at the university of california davis he said 
seven or eight sprays over an urban area is enough to kill off 
beneficial insects 
the aphid enjoying a backyard garden feast without reprisal 
leaves disfigured rosebuds wilted orchids and moldcoated leaves 
there are aphids on my violets aphids covering my herbs its 
horrifying said marty asolas 42 of bellflower i have just 
decided not to plant anything else because i cant bear to see my 
flowers attacked 
the aphid infestation was expected by state officials 
we knew this was going to happen but it is infinitely 
preferable to what the medfly can do to the state said robert 
dowell senior economic entomologist for the state department of 
food and agriculture 
aphids have become a hot topic among members of the pacific rose 
society said the organizations president bartje miller but 
members also blame prime aphid breeding weather a dry winter 
followed by warm spring showers 
its a whole combination of factors i think mother nature is 
just throwing us a curve said miller who is also chairwoman of 
wrigley gardens in pasadena 
the aphids are the worse ive seen in the eight years ive 
been here said clair g martin iii curator of roses at the 
huntington library art collections and botanical gardens in san 
marino 
it could take up to a year or longer after malathion spraying 
ends for gardens to become home again to beneficial insects we 
dont know what the long term effects are on plant life ehler 
said 
entomologists advise gardeners to control aphids and other pests 
by handwashing leaves with soap and water using more pesticide 
will only prolong the time it takes beneficial bugs to return and 
could burn leaves 
malathion spraying in southern california began in force last 
summer and was recently ordered over a wide area of riverside 
county that includes a commercial citrus grove

french president francois mitterrand on 
thursday proposed to president george bush that the 16 nato allies 
hold a summit before years end to discuss the changing face of 
europe 
mitterrand emerging from several hours of talks with bush at a 
seaside resort said bush agreed with the idea 
the summit would discuss the requirements of the new times 
head mitterrand said 
but although both men stressed the importance of maintaining 
cohesion within nato and maintaining us troops in europe 
mitterrand appeared to place more emphasis on european 
selfreliance 
nato must coordinate more closely with the other bodies within 
which the allies find themselves together in europe including 
the 12nation european economic community and the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe the french 
president said 
and i would add a very important additional note on this to 
prepare the europeans for the idea of playing an increased role in 
working for their own defense said mitterand 
and with that in mind i suggested to president bush and he 
agreed that we propose to our allies to hold a summit of the 
alliance before the end of the year he said 
mitterand said europeans should also speed up their economic and 
political union 
he cited a joint letter issued earlier thursday in europe by 
france and west german chancellor helmut kohl saying the first 
concrete steps toward economic and political union in the eec 
should be in place by jan 1 1993 
mitterrand also said he had emphasized the importance of the 
csce which takes in nato and warsaw pact nations we must always 
remember that the csce is and has been in the past the only place 
where all european countries can meet he said 
asked whether he believed greater european selfreliance could 
split the united states from its european allies bush said i 
dont see any danger of such division he added his views of 
europes future security were very close to those of the french 
bush said he had stressed to mitterrand the key role of the 
north atlantic treaty organization in the fall of communist 
governments in eastern europe the alliance must remain vigorous 
in this critical period of transition he said 
i told the president that the us will retain militarily 
significant nuclear and conventional forces in western europe as 
long as our allies desire our presence as part of a common security 
effort said bush and he indicated strong french support for 
the continued us presence

the nations factories released 46 billion 
pounds of toxic chemicals including scores of carcinogens in 
1988 the environmental protection agency reported thursday more 
than half of the pollutants went into the air 
the pollution emitted from 19762 industrial plants nationwide 
was 9 percent less than a year earlier but the epa said the 
decline may be a result of better record keeping 
epa officials cautioned that they are unable from the raw 
figures the latest available to assess the health risks to 
individuals the data do not take into account levels of toxicity 
release concentrations and actual exposure 
nevertheless federal officials have been surprised at the high 
volume of releases of toxic chemicals in both 1987 when 5 billion 
pounds of pollution was reported and 1988 the reporting 
requirement covers 332 toxic chemicals 
the figures are absolutely shocking declared rep gerry 
sikorksi dminn who along with several other members of congress 
obtained a special computer run on the epa figures and provided 
additional details about the releases 
among the chemicals routinely emitted from industrial sources 
were 77 carcinogens the most widely released cancercausing 
chemical 115 million pounds was dichloromethane a chemical 
often used as an industrial solvent and paint stripper 
industry released a total of 281 million pounds of carcinogens 
including chemicals such as arsenic benzene and vinyl chloride 
weve got to bring these pollution numbers down epa 
administrator william reilly said as he released the latest data 
cleanair legislation that already has passed the senate and is 
being considered in the house would impose stringent controls on 
toxic industrial chemicals and require companies to use the best 
available technology to curb releases 
under current law the epa is required to deal with each 
chemical separately in more than a decade it has placed controls 
on only eight of the hundreds of toxic chemicals in use many of 
the chemicals however are subject to local and state regulation 
the releases reported by industry however are legal and within 
federal standards officials said 
chemical and allied industries accounted for about half of the 
total releases two states with a concentration of petrochemical 
plants louisiana and texas accounted for more than onefourth 
of the pollution totals 
the toxic pollution figures reflect data provided the epa by 
19762 industrial plants nationwide it is the second year such 
reports have been provided under a new citizen righttoknow law 
the epa announcement provided only general release statistics 
and no information on specific plants 
but information released by sikorski from data contained on epa 
computer tapes showed that amax magnesium co of rowley utah had 
by far the highest volume of releases into the air nearly 110 
million pounds 
amax was followed among the top five industrial air polluters in 
1988 by tennessee eastman co kingsport tenn 40 million pounds 
avtex fibers in front royal va 34 million pounds triad 
chemical donaldsonville la 27 million pounds and eastman kodak 
co rochester ny 216 million pounds 
the avtex fibers plant in virginia closed last november after a 
lengthy battle with the state over pollution issues 
the states with the largest volume of toxic chemical releases 
overall were louisiana 716 million pounds texas 596 million 
pounds ohio 229 million pounds florida 226 million pounds 
indiana 213 million pounds and tennessee 203 million pounds 
according to the epa 
more than half of the toxic releases 243 billion pounds went 
into the air while the remainder was disposed of in surface water 
stored in landfills or injected into underground wells more than 
half of the air pollutants were reported by the petrochemical 
rubber plastics and primary metals industries 
industrial plants released 360 million pounds of toxic chemicals 
into lakes streams and rivers and disposed of 560 million pounds 
in onsite landfills about 122 billion pounds of chemicals were 
injected deep into underground wells for storage 
another 570 million pounds of toxic chemicals were transferred 
to municipal wastewater treatment plants for processing and an 
additional 11 billion pounds of chemicals were turned over for 
treatment and disposal at special offsite facilities or storage 
sites the epa said 
neither the chemicals sent to the municipal plants nor those 
sent elsewhere for treatment and disposal were counted by the epa 
in its overall release figure agency spokesman sean mcelheny said 
it is assumed most of those chemicals are treated and not released 
into the environment 
however the epa has in the past criticized many municipal 
treatment facilities for not adequately ensuring that industrial 
wastes are kept from being released into surface waters neither 
the private or municipal treatment facilities subject to the toxic 
release reporting requirements

french president francois mitterrand on 
thursday defended his countrys diplomatic ties to libya and iran 
saying both countries have denied responsibility for hostagetaking 
mitterrand said france maintains relations with many regimes 
we do not like 
at a news conference with president bush the french president 
said its very difficult to draw the line in deciding when a 
country deserves to be ostracized 
both iran and libya have always said that they were not at the 
origin of the hostagetaking said mitterrand 
the united states has drawn the line against relations with the 
two regimes accusing both of sponsoring international terrorism 
including in irans case influence over the terrorists holding 
american hostages in lebanon 
as you know we have a different situation in terms of 
relations with iran and libya said bush 
but on a day when the islamic jihad said in beirut it was 
reneging on its offer to release an american hostage bush said 
let me just take this opportunity to repeat what i said when i 
first became president goodwill begets goodwill and i link that 
to the release of american hostages 
we cant have normal relations when hostages are held he 
said adding that in libyas case a verifiable renunciation of 
terror is terribly important if we are to have better relations 
there 
the lawyerly mitterrand said its always a very difficult 
question 
he cited frances decision to maintain ties with chile during 
the bloody dictatorship of augusto pinochet which recently 
ended he said the french embassy became a useful point of 
transit for those working in the chilean resistance 
i think its probably a good idea to try to use those 
relations with iran and libya to try to help to get the 
release of the hostages said mitterrand the french president 
drew criticism at home last week when he praised libya for its role 
in securing the release of a french woman her belgian companion 
and their child who had been held hostage in lebanon 
mitterrand said most western countries do business with these 
countries and often on a large scale 
at any rate what is clear is that any country that would be 
directly involved in hostagetaking or that would be a clear 
accomplice in hostagetaking should be set outside the pale of the 
civilized world community mitterrand said 
on the middle east mitterrand said it was unacceptable to 
place conditions on where jewish refugees from the soviet union can 
settle but he also cautioned israel against further settlements on 
the west bank saying it is not wise to multiply such 
settlements because they give rise to a climate of uncertainty 
that could undermine peace efforts

president bush said thursday there are 
limits to us patience for soviet coercion of lithuania but 
refused to say when or how he might respond 
as moscow imposed new pressure on the breakway baltic republic 
by curbing oil and natural gas supplies bush said i am greatly 
concerned by this escalation in terms of using energy to push the 
lithuanians into line 
bush asked the extent of his patience said yes there are 
limits and having said that i am convinced that mr gorbachev 
knows there are limits 
bush made his comments at a news conference following a day of 
talks with french president francois mitterrand at a plush 
oceanside resort 
with palm trees and sparkling waters as the backdrop for an 
outdoor news conference the two leaders met for reporters for 78 
minutes 
the session was prolonged by translation of all the remarks into 
french bush appeared impatient at times looking around rubbing 
his chin and grimacing during lengthy statements by mitterrand 
on various subjects 
bush when asked about a report that mideast extremists had 
postponed a plan to release an america hostage in lebanon said 
weve been disappointed before hopes raised only to have them 
dashed by excessive speculation 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine said the 
release of a hostage was postponed because of us refusal to send 
john kelly assistant secretary of state for middle eastern 
affairs to syria to take part 
the united states does not knuckle under to demands said 
bush when asked why he did not dispatch kelly as demanded by the 
group 
the president said he was grateful to syria for trying to play 
a constructive role regarding the hostages 
mitterrand defending his countrys ties with libya and iran 
said he could not judge whether they were responsible for 
hostagetaking bush noted that the united states does not have 
ties with either country and said we cant have normal relations 
when hostages are held 
mitterrand said he had proposed a summit of the 16 nato allies 
before the end of the year to discuss the changing face of europe 
and that bush had concurred in the idea 
on lithuania bush and mitterrand joined in calling for dialogue 
to end the confrontation between soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the leaders of the breakaway baltic republic 
bush said he was deeply disturbed by soviet threats to cut 
off natural resources from the baltic republic 
lithuania said the cutoff had been put into action thursday but 
bush said the united states had not been able to confirm oddly 
the exact extent of a soviet crackdown 
there is a real need for a dialogue said mitterrand who 
noted that france like the united states has never accepted the 
incorporation of lithuania into the soviet union 
bush said secretary of state james a baker had discussed 
lithuania on wednesday with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
it was the second time in a week that bush had met with a 
western leader to discuss developments in eastern europe he 
traveled to bermuda to talk with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher last friday 
asked about a us response to soviet pressure against 
lithuania bush said i cant tell you when the us might do 
something but my reluctance stems from trying to keep open a 
dialogue and discussion that affects many many countries 
and im talking about arms control im talking about 
solidifying the democracies in eastern europe bush said 
he said he was confident that gorbachev understood there were 
limits to what would be tolerated concerning lithuania 
i dont think there is any danger that there will be a 
misunderstanding on this point said the president none at 
all 
bush had earlier warned moscow not to apply economic pressure 
against the baltic state saying the united states would react with 
appropriate responses 
on another front thursday anticipation about a possible hostage 
release had been fueled when syria sent word that one appeared to 
be imminent 
syrias message added weight to a similar report by the islamic 
jihad for the liberation of palestine the radical group holding 
three americans in lebanon the groups message was accompanied by 
a photograph of hostage jesse turner of boise idaho 
bush has tried to entice the kidnappers to release americans by 
pledging repeatedly that goodwill begets goodwill 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush had 
dispatched a hostage reception team to west germany to be on hand 
at the sprawling us air base at wiesbaden likely the first stop 
for any hostage freed in the middle east 
as for the situation in lithuania fitzwater said bush was 
consulting with major allies about possible responses to moscows 
actions in addition to the meeting with mitterrand bush talked by 
telephone wednesday with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
we will be in touch with all of the allies either directly or 
through diplomatic channels in the next few days fitzwater said 
asked if joint action was being considered fitzwater said i 
wouldnt put it in that category i think its more a consultation 
about what individual countries might do what their approach might 
be 
he said the best guide to a us response was bakers statement 
about possible restrictions of bilateral commercial contacts 
with moscow 
baker testifying before congress on wednesday indicated 
armscontrol negotiations and ussoviet talks about regional 
conflicts would not be affected 
fitzwater said there was some uncertainty about what was 
happening in lithuania and were still trying to get 
verification of the exact situation there 
bushs florida visit marked the seventh time he has met with

the government won a surprisingly easy victory 
thursday night in a crucial vote on a bill to give british 
passports and citizenship to an estimated 225000 hong kong 
residents 
the 650seat house of commons approved the measure by a vote of 
313216 despite rare opposition from both rightwingers in the 
governing conservative party opposed to increased immigration and 
from the socialist labor party which called the bill elitist 
the measure now goes to committee for possible amendments and 
then back to the house of commons where political observers say its 
passage is virtually assured it then must pass the unelected house 
of lords 
the government says it hopes the bill will become law by summer 
the 97vote margin of victory in the latest vote was far higher 
than political commentators predicted 
home secretary david waddington had argued that giving british 
citizenship to 50000 key hong kong residents and their families 
would prevent a braindrain and maintain confidence in the colony 
before it reverts to china in 1997 
the vote on the british nationality hong kong bill was seen as 
one of the toughest tests for prime minister margaret thatcher 
since she took power nearly 11 years ago because of the prospect 
of a conservative revolt and labor opposition 
the opposition labor party told its members to vote against it 
on grounds that only hong kongs elite will be given passports 
smaller opposition parties were divided on the bill 
an initial analysis of the vote showed 44 conservatives voting 
against the government and one labor member voting for the 
government the number of labor lawmakers voting against the 
government was not immediately available 
the voting capped an acrimonious and noisy debate in the commons 
under the bill 50000 hong kong residents in good jobs 
earning good salaries would be selected on a point system from a 
wide variety of fields to receive british passports waddington 
said 
first and foremost this is not an immigration bill he 
said this is a nationality bill designed to anchor people to 
hong kong rather than to encourage them to come here 
in an angry retort former conservative party chairman norman 
tebbit called for the bill to be thrown out he warned that it 
could lead to rising racial tension and accused the thatcher 
government of reneging on election pledges against largescale 
immigration 
these pledges were made because these islands of ours are 
already overcrowded and in the belief that great waves of 
immigration by people who do not share our culture our language 
our ways of social conduct in many cases who owe no allegiance to 
our culture was and is a destablizing factor in society he 
said 
labors deputy leader roy hattersley objected to the bill 
saying the only solution that meets the needs of all the people 
is to make major progress toward democracy in the colony 
but paddy ashdown leader of the centrist liberal democrats 
asked whether hattersley had not learned anything from the chinese 
government crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing last 
spring 
what democracy needs to be supported by is the right of 
those people to leave if they wish with a british passport and come 
to britain 
about 325 million hong kong chinese now hold a special category 
of british passport that do not confer a right to residence in 
britain

a klansman who is challenging a state 
law banning public wearing of masks and hoods testified thursday 
that he wore a mask during a oneman protest because he feared for 
his life 
i could lose my job my family might be in danger if 
people knew i was a klansman shade miller jr said during a 
hearing in gwinnett county state court 
miller said he was willing to challenge the 1951 law publicly 
because i felt it was my freedom of speech i feel this is 
wrong 
representatives of black and jewish advocacy groups testified 
that the antimask law has helped reduce klan violence 
the threat of the klan is the threat of violence and 
terrorism thats why the mask is offensive said charles 
wittenstein southern counsel for the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith 
earl shinhoster southeastern regional director for the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said georgians 
know the klan wardrobe represents harassment intimidation or 
carrying out acts of violence 
after the testimony state court judge howard cook said he will 
rule in about a month on millers legal challenge miller was 
arrested in february on a misdemeanor charge of wearing a mask and 
hood in downtown lawrenceville 
miller of calhoun asserted that a proper ku klux klan uniform 
includes the hood 
its one thing its like a suit and tie he said 
supporters of the law including civil rights groups say that 
without it the klan would be free to anonymously terrorize blacks 
and other minorities 
david fuller gwinnett countys chief assistant solicitor 
questioned millers assertion that he feared for his job pointing 
out that miller was unemployed at the time 
miller said his boss at his previous truckdriving job had 
warned him he would be in bad trouble if he joined the klan he 
testified he joined the invisible empire of the knights of the ku 
klux klan in july 1988 
millers attorney michael hauptman also called as a witness 
edward k fields a former klan organizer who said he believed the 
use of masks and hoods helped people overcome fears of joining the 
kkk 
in his crossexamination of wittenstein hauptman asked the 
bnai brith representative if people would feel threatened by 
masked gay rights demonstrators wittenstein replied that gay 
people do not have the klans history of violence 
hauptman has argued that the law is too broad covering people 
who would not be perceived as threats

the chief of the world health organization on 
thursday hailed a new eased us visa policy for participants at a 
world aids conference in san francisco but again asked washington 
to drop all travel restrictions on carriers of the aids virus 
who director general hiroshi nakajima also made plain his 
concern over us reaction if next months annual who assembly 
approves a plo bid to have the state of palestine join who as a 
member 
washington has threatened to cut off funds to any un agency 
admitting the palestine liberation organization as a fullfledged 
member arguing that the selfdeclared state does not meet 
internationally accepted norms of statehood 
the united states contributes 78 million or 25 percent to the 
1990 regular who budget 
under a new visa policy announced last week foreigners coming 
to attend certain professional conferences in the united states 
will be granted special 10day visas without having to reveal 
whether they are infected with the hivvirus that causes aids 
nakajima told a news conference that who cosponsor of the san 
francisco conference in june welcomes the new procedures 
however he added in a statement he read before a 
questionandanswer session who views the situation as not 
completely satisfactory and strongly urges the united states to 
continue its efforts to drop all travel restrictions against 
hivinfected persons 
the us policy was relaxed after several countries and 
organizations including france and switzerland said they would 
boycott the san francisco gathering the european parliament also 
asked scientists not to attend 
nakajima also cautioned on thursday that he was sure the united 
states would cease its contributions to the who regular budget if 
next months assembly accepts the plo as a a state member 
he said such a cutoff would force reduction of all important 
programs operated by who 
more than 100 countries have recognized the state of 
palestine since it was proclaimed by the plos legislative body 
in tunis in 1988 
last year the who assembly voted to defer a decision until 1990 
nakajima said it was his understanding that a decision by the 
us congress to stop payments to any un agency granting full plo 
membership would not apply to voluntary contributions such as to 
the who global program on aids 
that program which has a 1990 budget of 78 million is 
exclusively financed by grants the united states which leads the 
world in the number of aids cases has pledged to contribute 25 
million 
nakajima was pressed repeatedly to elaborate on his comments on 
the resignation of the american head of the program dr jonathan 
mann 
mann told nakajima in a letter last month he was not renewing 
his contract because of a great variance between our positions on 
a series of issues he considered critical for the global aids 
strategy 
nakajima reiterated there had been no differences on basic 
strategy questions he declined to go into detail saying entering 
into polemics would not be in the interest of the aids program 
he said he personally had very good relations with mann

senate republicans said on thursday they would 
write their own campaign finance reform bill to reduce the ability 
of labor unions and other groups to spend money on political 
activities including voter registration 
republicans however were divided on how far to go beyond 
democrats in restricting how much money candidates can take from 
labor corporate and trade association political action committees 
that rely on voluntary contributions 
there was no resolution sen john danforth of missouri said 
upon emerging from an hourlong meeting among more than half of the 
senates 45 republicans in gop leader bob doles office 
in a bill scheduled to be brought to the senate floor next week 
democrats would retain the current 5000 limit a pac can 
contribute to a candidate for each primary runoff and general 
election but impose a ceiling on the total pac contributions a 
candidate can receive 
president bush wants an outright abolition of pacs which in 
recent elections have overwhelmingly favored incumbent lawmakers 
since democrats hold majorities in both the senate and house they 
have enjoyed pac largesse more than republicans 
we spent a lot of time talking about the pac issue and how far 
to go kentucky sen mitch mcconnell who will manage the 
republican side of the debate said of the meeting in doles 
office we disagree on just a very few things such as how far to 
go in bashing pacs 
mcconnell said republicans are divided into three camps 
those who want to go along with bush and abolish pacs outright 
those who would reduce the amount a pac can contribute to a 
candidate for each primary runoff and general election to 1000 
and those who want to abolish labor and corporate pacs but only 
reduce to 1000 the contribution that issueoriented unconnected 
pacs such as those of the national rife association environmental 
groups and both sides of the abortion debate 
an overwhelming majority of the republicans in the meeting 
opposed provisions in the democratic bill that would basically 
impose spending ceilings of 400000 on house candidates and 
950000 to 55 billion for senate candidates depending on the 
population of a state mcconnell said 
however he said republicans endorsed the idea of socalled 
flexible ceilings that would place no limits on how much a 
candidate can raise from homestate residents but would cap 
contributions from outofstate donors 
i still believe that the president a former chairman of the 
republican national committee will veto a bill that has spending 
limits in or out of state said mcconnell one of the most 
vociferous opponents of ceilings 
republicans he said are united on abolishing the use of 
socalled soft unreported money by unions and other taxexempt 
organizations for voter registration drives 
academic experts have estimated that unions spent up to 45 
million of such money in the 1988 election almost all of it 
benefitting democrats 
and it was through a taxexempt california voter registration 
project headed by the son of senate democratic whip alan cranston 
that phoenix savings and loan operator charles h keating jr gave 
850000 of the total 13 million contributed to five senators 
if youre taxexempt you shouldnt be playing the political 
game said dole if were really concerned about cleaning up 
the campaign sewer money then its about time to spray the sewer 
stench with a big can of legislative lysol

a teargas grenade exploded thursday night 
outside a religious meeting in an ultraorthodox jewish town 
injuring at least nine people witnesses and police said 
an anonymous caller said a jewish extremist organization carried 
out the attack in the tel aviv suburb of bneibrak 
officials said the attack came in response to an orthodox 
political partys support to the leftleaning labor party which is 
trying to form israels next government 
an israel television report showed the site surrounded by dozens 
of ultraorthodox jews in traditional long black coats police vans 
and ambulances with wailing sirens were transporting the injured 
the television said 11 people were injured by gas inhalation and 
one was hit in the head in the scuffle that followed the attack 
but bneibrak mayor moshe irenstein reported only nine injured 
the grenade exploded outside a hall where hundreds of religious 
jews gathered for a special ceremony to celebrate the end of their 
studies of a portion of talmud the body of jewish law and 
rabbinical commentaries 
a police spokeswoman ahuva ivri said an anonymous caller told 
israel army radio the attack was carried out by the sicarites a 
radical jewish group believed responsible for a series of arson 
attacks and death threats against leftist and liberal israelis 
advocating peace talks with palestinians 
the sicarites who take their name from a radical sect that 
assassinated opponents in roman times claimed responsibility for 
the april 1989 shooting outside jerusalems walled old city that 
left one arab dead and three wounded 
the gathering in bneibrak was organized by the ultraorthodox 
agudat israel party which supports the leftleaning labor in its 
attempts to form israels next coalition government 
labor advocates territorial concessions in peace negotiations 
with the arabs 
the attack came shortly after a defecting agudat israel member 
abraham verdiger announced that he decided to return to his party 
and support labor 
it is possible that the attack came in response said 
witness eliezer steizberg an agudat official 
the defection of verdiger and another party member last week 
prevented labor from forming a new government in the 120member 
parliament 
irenstein the mayor denounced the attack 
we condemn it such a thing has never happened at a gathering 
devoted to torah 
irenstein said threats will not deter his political party and 
their pledge to form a new government with labor 
now with gods help we have to succeed

the environmental protection agency on 
thursday rejected a petition from environmentalists asking that any 
pesticide that poses even a slight cancer risk be prohibited for 
use on processed foods 
the epa affirmed its intention not to use the zerotolerance 
standard in cases where the cancer risk is considered negligible 
several suits are pending before various federal courts challenging 
the epa position 
under a provision of the federal pesticide laws a 
cancercausing pesticide must be prohibited for use on processed 
food products if even the slightest residue levels are found the 
zero tolerance standard is called the delaney clause after the 
congressman who pushed for its enactment 
the epa in 1988 concluded that because of modern techniques that 
can discern even exceedingly small amounts of pesticide residue it 
would not invoke the delaney clause in cases where residue levels 
were negligible 
that prompted several environmental groups including the 
natural resources defense council to file a petition challenging 
the epa policy 
the epa said thursday it was denying the petition and would 
continue to disregard the delaney principle in cases where residue 
levels are negligible agency lawyers have argued that the 
government is not legally required to comply with the delaney 
provision in all cases 
at the same time however the epa acknowleged for the first 
time that it would apply the delaney priciple for socalled old 
pesticides those that have been approved and later found to cause 
cancer as long as the residue levels are more than negligible 
most pesticides found on processed foods are old pesticides 
so environmentalists characterized that epa decision to apply the 
delaney principle even to a limited extent as somewhat of a 
victory 
if properly implemented todays decision will lead to a far 
safer food supply said al meyerhoff an attorney for the nrdc

no one knows how much radioactive material is 
buried on us military bases sen john glenn said thursday as he 
released an investigative report with more questions than answers 
none of the three services has a complete grip on what type 
and how much lowlevel radioactive waste it has generated said 
glenn dohio who made public a report prepared at his request by 
the general accounting office 
glenn said he wanted the auditors to figure out how much it will 
cost the military to deal with its waste but they didnt have 
enough information even to attempt an estimate all they could say 
with certainty was that the cost of disposing of the waste is going 
to skyrocket 
the army has found that surcharges tacked onto the cost of 
disposing of its lowlevel radioactive waste over the next few 
years will be higher than the actual disposal cost and we cant 
even take a guess as to what the navy and air force may have to pay 
because they dont have accurate records glenn said 
glenns interest in the radioactive waste on military bases was 
triggered by a 1986 spill at wrightpatterson air force base near 
dayton ohio that cost the government more than 1 million to 
clean up 
unmarked drums of radioactive americium241 which had been 
brought illegally onto the base were accidentally opened 
contaminating a building and exposing some workers 
after that episode the navy and air force initiated surveys to 
discover how much and what kind of waste was stored at each 
installation but the gao report said those surveys werent 
completed just under half of the installations returned their 
survey questionnaires the report said 
the air force is scheduled this year to begin excavating 
lowlevel radioactive waste buried in the early 1950s after the 
air force stopped burying that waste it failed to provide 
instructions on maintaining the sites or recordkeeping the report 
said 
as a result the air force is facing a cleanup situation of 
unknown proportions he said 
the air force referred a request for comment to capt sig adams 
who did not return a telephone message the gao report said the 
facts in the report were discussed with officials in all three 
military branches and they generally agreed with the facts 
glenn said hes considering various legislative options but 
he wants the pentagon to get a fix on the problem and put a 
radioactive waste disposal program in place without having 
this points out the problem its up to them to do 
something he said

a majority of large banks responding to a 
survey said they had tightened their lending practices for real 
estate loans in the last six months federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said 
greenspan said the federal reserve which regulates bank holding 
companies had surveyed 60 of the countrys largest banks in 
january to determine whether it was easier or harder for businesses 
to obtain credit 
a large majority of the banks said they had become less 
willing to make construction and land development loans during the 
past six months greenspan said in written responses released 
thursday by the senate banking committee 
greenspan did not provide a specific percentage figure but said 
that most banks responding to the survey also had tightened 
standards for making mergerrelated loans or loans to businesses 
with lower credit ratings 
onefifth of the banks said they were less willing to make 
general business loans greenspan said 
the banks blamed the tighter credit policies primarily on the 
economys weakness late last year which made them scrutinize loan 
requests more carefully other factors cited by the banks were 
rising numbers of bad loans and closer scrutiny by banking 
regulators 
many small and mediumsized businesses have complained they are 
facing a severe credit crunch at present as financial institutions 
are forced to tighten credit practices under pressure from federal 
regulators who have become more strict in the wake of the giant 
savings and loan bailout 
greenspans comments came in response to a question submitted by 
sen john f kerry dmass who said many businesses in his state 
were complaining about their inability to get credit 
greenspan said the fed was aware that banks in new england and 
other areas of the country had tightened their lending standards 
he said such a development could have an impact on overall economic 
activity in a region 
but he said for the lending slowdown to pose serious threats to 
the health of the economy it would need to be more severe than what 
the fed has detected and extend for a longer period of time 
greenspan said it was essential for banks to meet the financing 
needs of their communities but in a prudent manner 
as recent experience has shown there are substantial costs 
associated with both too much restraint and with too little he 
said we federal regulators are attempting to strike the proper 
balance

when imelda marcos visited new york in 1983 she 
put 1 million toward a michelangelo painting and spent millions 
more on jewelry documents in evidence at her fraud trial show 
during a visit a year later she spent 55 at mcdonalds other 
expenses included a 19400 order of nightgowns towels 
tablecloths and bedsheets and a hotel bill at the waldorf astoria 
for 18401 
the purchases were logged in stenographer notebooks kept by mrs 
marcos personal secretary fe roa jimenez during mrs marcos 
trips to the united states in the early 1980s 
the notebooks entered in evidence tuesday were found in the 
philippine presidential palace in 1986 after mrs marcos husband 
ferdinand e marcos was ousted as president and they fled to 
hawaii 
mrs marcos 60 is on trial on charges she and her late husband 
bought four new york properties and financed a lavish lifestyle 
between 1981 and 1983 with more than 160 million allegedly 
embezzled from their homelands treasury 
many of ms jimenezs handwritten entries were for jewelry 
purchases such as a 200000 diamond bracelet and 360000 for 
antique jewelry 
the biggest single expenditure during the may 1983 trip was the 
1 million payment toward the unidentified michelangelo painting 
leaving a 25 million balance 
during a 1984 visit to new york mrs marcos spent 13284 in a 
single day at bloomingdales department store according to a 
ledger food expenses ranged from 5595 for hamburgers and fish 
fillets at mcdonalds to 305 for lunch at a manhattan restaurant 
two days later 
in testimony thursday a former philippine banking official said 
the marcoses worried about their countrys diminished us dollar 
reserves while they allegedly bought manhattan real estate with 
embezzled government funds 
jaime laya who served as governor of the philippine central 
bank from 1981 to 1984 testified that he discussed with president 
marcos in september 1983 ways to obtain private loans to replenish 
the treasury because banks were reluctant to lend the country money 
marcos also was charged in the 1988 indictment along with his 
wife he died last september in exile in hawaii 
another witness former philippine national bank official oscar 
carino said that jimenez asked him for as much as 500000 in cash 
during each of mrs marcos trips to new york prosecutors have 
described the banks new york office as mrs marcos own personal 
piggy bank 
the notebooks revealed bits and pieces of mrs marcos social 
activities including broadway shows and contained references to 
numerous celebrities such as singer julio iglesias actor george 
hamilton and industrialist armand hammer 
one notation concerned a request by former philippine sen 
benigno aquino jr to meet with mrs marcos in new york on may 12 
1983 aquino a marcos foe then living in exile in the united 
states was murdered at the manila airport when he returned home 
three months later 
in his testimony thursday laya said he attended a meeting at 
the marcoses official residence in manila at which mrs marcos 
asked prominent filipino businessmen to use their contacts abroad 
to help the philippines in its time of crisis 
the meeting resulted in marcos decision to issue treasury bonds 
in us dollar denominations that would be repaid with interest in 
two years laya said 
when the treasury bonds did not immediately spur investments 
laya said he asked marcos for help and a few days later three 
foreign banks bought bonds worth 75 million 
the witness said 15 million came from banque paribas a swiss 
institution where prosecutors claim the marcoses held secret 
accounts for funds allegedly stolen from their homelands treasury 
laya who testified with immunity for the prosecution served on 
marcos cabinet as minister of education culture and sports from 
1984 until february 1986 when marcos was ousted from power 
in his position as the central banks governor laya supervised 
the regulation of the countrys money supply

the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine said wednesday 
that it would release one of the three us educators it has held 
since 1987

about 9000 contras fighters are in nicaragua 
an addendum said the contras will start turning in their weapons 
on wednesday afternoon april 25 after mrs chamorro takes office 
from president daniel ortega with the contra fighting force to be 
disbanded completely by june 10 
missions from the united nations and the organization of 
american states as well as roman catholic cardinal miguel obando 
y bravo were charged with supervising the ceasefire and 
demobilization 
the accord completed after 14 hours of negotiations does not 
meet the sandinista fronts demand that the contras disband by 
april 25 
but it also makes no mention of what had been a key contra 
demand that the sandinista peoples army be neutralized as a 
condition for the rebels to surrender their weapons 
mrs chamorros united national opposition alliance clearly 
gained the most from the agreement the opportunity to start its 
government in peace instead of in the middle of civil war bitter 
recriminations or antigovernment strikes as had been feared 
after nine years of civil war that cost 30000 people their 
lives in a country of 3 million each side was suspicious of the 
others motives and neither wanted to be the first to put down its 
weapons 
the army is controlled by the sandinista party and the contras 
insisted that they wouldnt disarm until they were sure mrs 
chamorro had full control of the government and it was safe for 
them to return home 
under a protocol with mrs chamorros coalition the sandinistas 
agreed to depoliticize the army and reduce its size in exchange 
the incoming government promised to respect the integrity and 
professionalism of the army 
some sandinistas appeared disappointed the accord did not call 
for the immediate disbanding of the contras and a mob of youths 
chanting anticontra slogans surrounded a car carrying aronson 
hours after the agreement was signed 
the us embassy vehicle was ringed as it left managuas 
airport the mob beat on the cars windows but was startled by a 
loud bang like a firecracker and the vehicle was able to leave 
aronson later met with ortega and mrs chamorro for several 
hours each but commented only after talking with mrs chamorro 
saying they had discussed economics the transition the peace 
process and president bushs proposed 300 million aid package 
washington backed the contras in their war but supported mrs 
chamorros call for their dissolution 
sandinista army gen humberto ortega the defense minister and 
brother of the president said he was satisfied with what he called 
a peace effort reached in a profound serious way with a great 
spirit of responsibility 
let it be clear that what has been signed here is something 
serious something formal and i think that we all have the good 
will to fulfill this signed document said oscar sovalbarro the 
contras senior negotiator 
lacayo gen ortega and sovalbarro along with obando y bravo 
the archbishop of managua signed the main contra agreement 
a separate accord was reached between the sandinista army and 
the yatama atlantic front the miskito indian rebel contingent 
fighting the sandinistas in nicaraguas atlantic coast region 
the yatama accord calls for a ceasefire covering the sparsely 
populated eastern half of nicaragua to start at midnight thursday 
the rebel indians have two separate security zones and they are to 
disband by may 18 
gen ortega said technical and operational hurdles made it 
logistically impossible to meet an april 25 deadline for disbanding 
the contras 
making the contras disarm by inauguration day had become nearly 
an obsession with the sandinistas who were trounced in the feb 25 
election however gen ortega dismissed the failure to have the 
contras disarm immediately 
the delay is nothing if we compare it to the tragedy and 
suffering that we have had to endure during these years of war 
he said

president carlos salinas de gortari on 
thursday warned the united states against actions such as the 
alleged abduction of a mexican doctor for trial in the murder of a 
us drug agent enrique camarena 
salinas said his nation has joined the battle against drug 
trafficking in good faith but we will not permit anybody not 
drug traffickers nor their pursuers to violate mexican rights 
dr humberto alvarez machain a suspect in the 1985 
tortureslaying of camarena was arrested april 3 in el paso 
texas his us lawyer robert steinberg said alvarez was 
kidnapped at his office in guadalajara the previous day 
in the fight against drugs the law is rendered useless by 
illegal actions or by trying to measure justice with a ruler of 
one country in foreign territory salinas told an international 
conference on drug trafficking 
mexico has asked the united states to explain how alvarez got to 
el paso and us attorney general richard thornburgh said an 
investigation is being conducted 
mexican attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said 
wednesday the incident might hinder usmexico cooperation in the 
drug war 
thornburgh and his mexican counterpart met privately thursday 
and a us justice department statement said without elaborating 
that the two nations would continue working together 
the los angeles times on wednesday quoted unidentified mexican 
sources as saying agents in the drug enforcement administrations 
los angeles office arranged to kidnap alvarez without the knowledge 
of their superiors in washington 
a senior salinas administration official told the associated 
press that mexican officials believe alvarez was abducted by bounty 
hunters and that mexican police were not involved 
alvarez 42 is one of 19 mexicans indicted by a us grand jury 
in los angeles on charges of kidnapping torturing and killing 
camarena in 1985 he was arraigned earlier this month and pleaded 
innocent 
in mexico two drug lords rafael caro quintero and ernesto 
fonseca have been convicted and sentenced to long terms in the 
camarena killing 
although salinas mentioned neither the united states nor alvarez 
by name in his speech to an international antidrug conference at 
this coastal resort his meaning was clear 
the fight against drug trafficking cant be used as an excuse 
to violate the law in a countrys own territory and much less so 
in a foreign nations territory said salinas 
mexico fights drug trafficking because it considers it a 
menace to the security of the state and a threat to the health of 
our families and our youth salinas told the conference which 
drew representatives from 32 nations 
the alvarez arrest has drawn protests from mexicans who cite it 
as an example of us highhandedness opponents have tried to rally 
nationalist sentiment by saying salinas is letting the united 
states take advantage of mexico on trade drugs and other issues 
in his speech to the conference thornburgh made no mention of 
the alvarez incident but praised the salinas administrations 
commitment to the war on drugs 
we have demonstrable proof of the mexican authorities resolve 
to deal with these problems mexico has brought to justice several 
of the worlds most notorious drug kingpins mexico has become a 
leader in promoting international cooperation thornburgh said 
in a written statement thornburgh said his office has begun a 
full investigation 
until i have received that report it would be premature to 
comment thornburgh added in a brief interview with reporters 
asked how alvarez appeared in the united states a member of the 
american delegation said an answer would have to await the report 
to thornburgh 
all we know is that a plane arrived in el paso and the dea 
met the plane said the official

federal officials thursday proposed 64 million 
in fines against phillips 66 co and a contractor in connection 
with a texas chemical plant explosion that killed 23 workers and 
injured 124 last october 
the proposed fines of 567 million against phillips and 
729600 against fish engineering and construction inc would be 
the second largest for a single inspection by the federal 
occupational health and safety administration 
osha accused phillips of 566 willful violations and nine serious 
violations at the houston chemical complex in suburban pasadena 
the agency accused fish engineering a maintenence contractor at 
the plant of 181 willful violations 12 serious violations and one 
of mismanaging records 
a series of explosions oct 23 destroyed the section of the 
plant that makes polyethylene which is used to make plastics 
twentythree workers were killed and 124 were hurt 
we conducted an extensive investigation of what caused this 
catastrophe said gilbert saulter oshas southwest regional 
administrator 
he said the agency determined that the explosion would not have 
occurred had phillips provided a safe workplace by following 
osha and industry standards 
phillips and fish engineering have 15 days to contest the fines 
at no time has phillips ever compromised the safety of its 
employees the company said in a statement based on 
preliminary information we do plan to contest a number of the 
citations and we do take issue with osha characterizing any of the 
violations as willful acts 
phillips 66 is the chemical production and marketing arm of 
phillips petroleum co 
fish engineering said in a statement that it also would contest 
the fines 
however the statement said oshas investigation confirmed 
that the houston contractor did not cause or contribute to the 
explosion 
saulter said one of the major problems at the plant included the 
lack of a doublevalve system as a failsafe on gas emissions 
phillips officials have said the explosion occurred after a seal 
on a polyethylene reactor ruptured leaking highly flammable 
ethylene and isobutane gas from a pipeline it was unclear what 
ignited the gas 
workers reported that only a few seconds elapsed between the 
time they spotted a cloud of gas heard warning sirens and were 
rocked by explosions 
saulter said the deficiencies described as willful violations 
fell into three categories failure to prevent the release of 
flammable vapors failure to minimize or mitigate the consequences 
of a release and failure to provide adequate fire protection 
the serious violations include inadequate emergency exits and 
emergency planning inaudible emergency alarm sire and deficiencies 
in hazard communications and respiratory protection programs 
phillips petroleum president glenn cox said the companys 
investigation showed the explosion was the result of a departure 
from established routine procedures 
we are thoroughly evaluating our procedures and training to 
determine how the possibility for error can be further minimized 
cox said in a statement issued from company headquarters in 
bartlesville okla 
saulter said phillips officials already have contacted osha 
about the reconstruction of the plant and possible modifications at 
the site but declined to give specifics of the talks 
he said labor secretary elizabeth dole is expected to give 
president bush a report in the coming weeks about the accident 
what should be done at the new plant and what changes might be 
needed at other plants across the country 
the largest fine ever sought by osha was proposed last november 
when the government said it was seeking 73 million from usx corp 
for 2000 alleged safety violations at a steel plant near 
pittsburgh and another on the pennsylvania side of the delaware 
river near trenton nj usx has contested the fine

the son of a former panamanian president 
said thursday that he was joking when he told a pawnbroker he had 
a bullet with bushs name engraved on it 
but the secret service took otto lakas at his word and he was 
being held without bail on a federal charge of threatening to kill 
the president 
i was not serious not at all otto lakas said in an 
jailhouse interview i didnt do anything i am very confused 
all i know is that i am in jail 
lakas a 21yearold architecture student at lubbock christian 
university was arrested tuesday after a secret service 
investigation police said lakas had no previous record 
according to court documents from the secret service lakas 
tried to buy a 357 colt revolver at the exect pawn shop and told 
clerk stacy nichols i have a 223caliber rifle at home and a 
bullet with bushs name engraved on it 
bush is coming to lubbock and i will blow his head off 
the white house has announced no plans for a bush visit to 
lubbock although bush is scheduled to visit dallas houston and 
austin in may 
federal agents say lakas was upset over last decembers us 
invasion of panama which resulted in the arrest of panamas 
leader gen manuel noriega on drug charges 
the us got a bad guy but a lot of good people were hurt a 
secret service affidavit quoted lakas as saying to nichols who 
twice refused to sell him a gun 
lakas father demetrio b lakas was figurehead president of 
panama from 1972 to 1978 during the time panama was ruled by gen 
omar torrijos 
noriega was a disciple of torrijos and gained ascendancy in the 
military after the popular leader died in a 1981 plane crash 
lakas brother basilio on wednesday told the texas tech 
student newspaper the university daily that the whole thing is 
a misunderstanding and there is no reason to blow it out of 
proportion 
in the affidavit for a search warrant the secret service said 
lakas tried on april 2 to buy a colt revolver at the pawnshop but 
was turned away by nichols because he did not have a texas drivers 
license or a state identification card 
on april 4 lakas went back to the same pawnshop produced a 
texas identification card and told nichols he wanted to send the 
weapon to his father in panama according to the affidavit 
when nichols told lakas that he could go to jail for making a 
threat against bush lakas said they will not mess with me 
because of his family connections in panama according to the 
secret service 
nichols told lakas to think about buying the gun and return 
later lakas did not return but called nichols later to say he no 
longer wanted to buy the gun court documents said 
most pawnbrokers would not have thought twice about taking 
850 for the gun which is what he offered to pay for it nichols 
said thursday but i said no i was just doing my civic duty 
nichols said he waited two weeks to tell federal agents about it 
because he feared reprisals by lakas he notified authorities on 
monday 
the secret service said agents searched lakas house tuesday and 
found a stun gun and a bbgun

state lawmakers broke a deadlock thursday 
on school financing that would raise teachers salaries ending a 
strike that idled classes for more than 300000 students this week 
as striking teachers crowded the halls of the capitol and 
thousands more rallied outside senators approved an emergency 
clause on a 230 million education reform and tax bill shortly 
before 6 pm the bill was sent to gov henry bellmon who said he 
would sign the bill at an undetermined date 
the emergency clause which allows the bill to become law as 
soon as it is signed had been a stumbling block to the package 
the senate failed last week to pass it prompting the oklahoma 
education association to call for a fiveday teacher walkout 
the bill calls for spending 681 million to raise minimum 
teacher salaries by 1500 a year for four years the bill would 
not increase the salaries of teachers above the minimums but 212 
million budgeted for schools could be used for teacher salaries and 
other items 
oklahoma teachers rank 48th in pay among the states making an 
average of 22000 a year the national average is 29648 in 
oklahoma the minimum beginning teachers salary with a bachelor 
degree is 15060 
a new day is dawning for education in oklahoma bellmon said 
after the vote oklahoma will no longer take a back seat among 
the states where education is concerned from now on others can 
look to oklahoma for leadership in education 
union officials said the passage would end the walkout which 
was in its fourth day thursday it was unclear if regular classes 
would held friday 
teachers in districts already closed for the week planned to 
hold a thank you rally at the capitol on friday said nancy 
jewell spokeswoman for the oklahoma education association 
thousands of teachers as well as some administrators parents 
and students protested earlier thursday over the legislative 
stalemate on a bill that calls for raising the state sales tax and 
increasing personal and corporate income taxes to pay for the 
education reforms 
a halfcent increase in the 4cent state sales tax increase 
would raise 104 million as would a 10 percent increase in 
personal income taxes an increase in the corporate tax from 5 
percent to 6 percent would produce 22 million 
a compromise that would give tax rebates to lowincome families 
led to the passage of the emergency clause as the vote on the 
clause was announced shortly before 6 pm a loud cheer broke out 
in the senate gallery 
the need to resolve the stalemate had taken on an added urgency 
after senate president pro tempore bob cullison a democrat said 
he might adjourn the special session thursday effectively killing 
the measure 
senate appropriations chairman stratton taylor a democrat 
earlier brought cheers from protesting teachers when he told a 
rally of more than 10000 that democratic senators were meeting and 
might have a solution after a day of closed caucuses 
the oklahoma education association which called for the walkout 
last week said 145 school districts in the state were closed 
thursday among those were tulsa oklahoma city and lawton the 
three largest districts in the state with about 95000 students 
state education officials have said the walkout has affected 
about 60 percent or 343200 of the states 572000 students have 
been affected the state has 606 school districts 
some schools have remained open throughout the week while 
others have been closed the entire time in some instances parents 
and businessmen have made the trek to the capitol while teachers 
have stayed in the classroom 
the oea represents 31000 of the states estimated 35000 
teachers 
the democratic majority apparently was not involved in any 
negotiations with republicans who voted against the education 
reform and tax bill earlier causing the stalemate 
thursdays demonstrators undaunted by rain and soggy grounds 
staged the most boisterous rally of the week 
sen taylor touched off a round of chants that echoed through 
the capitol area when he proposed a new motto never last again 
i dont believe the people of oklahoma want to be at the 
bottom of the heap in salaries or educational funding said 
house speaker steve lewis who is the principal author of the 
education package

soaring health care costs could bankrupt the 
medicare trust fund that pays for hospital care before the turn of 
the century the funds board of trustees says 
in its annual report to congress the board said early 
corrective action is essential in order to avoid the need for 
later potentially precipitous changes 
the hospital insurance trust fund is financed with payroll 
taxes while currently more than four covered workers support each 
beneficiary that ratio will start slipping early in the next 
century by the middle of the next century there will be just two 
covered workers supporting each beneficiary 
not only are the anticipated reserves and financing of the 
hospital insurance program inadequate to offset this demographic 
change the trust fund is projected to become exhausted even before 
the major demographic shift begins to occur said the report 
released wednesday

a government plan to give the roman 
catholic church a television channel has created strong opposition 
in a nation where the church worked closely with a halfcentury 
dictatorship overthrown 16 years ago 
prime minister anibal cavaco silvas plan would provide the 
church not just a platform for religious opinions but a full 
commercial franchise for one of two private channels that are to 
end a 26year state monopoly on television 
it has provoked heated debate of the churchs place in a society 
that still retains considerable anticlerical feeling from the 
revolution by leftist military officers on april 25 1974 
conservative businessmen among the centerright premiers 
staunchest supporters have joined the left against the plan 
even the church is not happy the catholic bishops conference 
also wants control of evening programming on one of the two state 
channels and extended air time on weekends 
the debate has split cavaco silvas social democratic party 
which faces elections next year to preserve its parliamentry 
majority 
i think it is immoral to grant a channel without a public 
tender said franciso pinto balsemao once a social democratic 
premier and now a media executive his company is a leading 
contender for one of the private channels 
leftists and liberals worry about the political impact of church 
television and recall the roman catholic hierarchys close 
cooperation with the dictatorial regime founded by antonio oliveira 
salazar 
salazar granted the church a radio station radio renascenca in 
1936 the stations management is leading the church campaign for a 
television channel 
when cavaco silva liberalized radio broadcasting last year he 
restricted private stations to local transmission but left 
renascenca as portugals only national station not under state 
control 
renascenca has very strong political views and they interfere 
a lot pinto balsemao the former prime minister told the 
associated press we cannot say it is an independent project 
since the 1974 revolution the church has entered politics in 
unsuccessful efforts to stop leftist governments from liberalizing 
divorce laws and legalizing abortion 
church leaders organized a long and emotional campaign against 
abortion in the early 1980s with the support of the social 
democrats and conservative parties a parliamentary majority of 
socialists and communists legalized abortion in 1984 
moises espirito santo a sociologist at lisbons new university 
specializing in religious affairs said he doubted the church could 
enlist as much support for the television channel as it had against 
abortion 
the church today has more political power than it had under 
salazar but this lacks the emotion of the abortion issue he 
said in an interview 
more than 96 percent of portuguese are roman catholic but 
figures published recently in the newspaper o jornal indicate only 
27 percent attend mass regularly 
strength of religious feeling varies widely the report said 
about 65 percent of people in northern minho province go to church 
regularly but the number dips below 5 percent in the southern 
alentejo the rural stronghold of the communist party 
espirito santo said much of portugals popular religious 
feeling particularly in the countryside is based on traditional 
beliefs and less influenced by teachings of the bishops in the 
cities 
efforts by clerics to sway votes may have helped thwart 
communist ambitions immediately after the revolution but increased 
political awareness after 16 years of democracy means few people 
now follow their priests political guidance he said 
the church no longer has any electoral weight espirito 
santo declared its influence lies in the links the bishops have 
with politicians 
some catholics wonder whether the church will compromise its 
moral standards by entering the materialistic world of tv 
advertising and competition with the racy brazilian soap operas 
portuguese viewers enjoy 
what sort of commercial television can they have pinto 
balsemao asked what sort of advertising can they accept are 
they going to have dallas and dynasty and the brazilian 
telenovelas soap operas which are full of sex and beautiful 
almostnaked girls 
fernando magalhaes crespo director of radio renascenca said 
moral standards would be maintained 
it will be a television with programs parents wont be ashamed 
to watch with their children he told balsemaos weekly newspaper 
expresso 
magalhaes crespo said dallas and falcon crest britains 
benny hill and many of the brazilian soaps were not likely to 
appear on the catholic channel 
espirito santo said the argument over telvision is the latest in 
a long line of disputes dating to the 19th century when conflicts 
between clerical and secular political groups sometimes became 
bloody 
roman catholicism was the state religion until 1910 when an 
anticlerical revolution overthrew the monarchy and founded the 
republic

us foreign policy is gaining support at 
the united nations and there is less emphasis on linking foreign 
aid to how a recipient country votes the american ambassador says 
some arab envoys however expect the bush administration and 
congress to put pressure on recipients of american aid to rescind a 
general assembly resolution adopted in 1975 that equates zionism 
and racism 
ambassador thomas r pickering the us permanent 
representative told reporters recently the idea of linking us 
foreign aid to supportive un votes never rose to massive 
proportions and the fact is that there is less focus now on 
scorecarding in aid than there was before 
i dont think at this stage one can say this is completely a 
dead letter but i dont see it rising to high prominence i 
dont believe there is such overwhelming interest in it 
i think we in fact should give assistance where we believe 
it is in our broad foreign policy interests to do so all factors 
considered 
the ambassador said nothing of the zionismracism resolution and 
arab statements made later that some members of congress wanted 
to penalize nations that did not follow the us line 
in decemb is 
chairman 
we have a list of who the aid recipients are and how the vote 
was and do they understand their aid is in jeopardy moynihan 
said i mean enough is enough 
the soviet union no longer rewards that behavior have 
they learned it and do they know that this country is angry about 
that because they have put peace in jeopardy in a place they had no 
business bothering in 
what does it mean to chile what does it mean to sri lanka 
whose business is it in the ivory coast to cause instability in the 
middle east 
moynihan called the document a low point in un behavior 
and an attempt to politicize the general assembly 
nearly 70 percent of political resolutions received unanimous 
support in the 44th general assembly last year according to the 
latest voting report that compares with 64 percent in 1988 60 
percent in 1987 and 58 percent in 1986 
it said other un members voted with the united states 233 
percent of the time on the 16 issues which ranged from the 
invasion of panama to the annual question of accepting israels 
credentials when all general assembly votes are examined the 
figure declines to 169 percent 
some un diplomats say voting the same way does not guarantee 
an identical point of view they also suggest that if more 
countries are voting with the united states changes in us policy 
may be the reason

when dawn breaks over the alleghany 
mountains and shines dimly on stonewall jackson barracks cadets in 
gray and black uniforms march to the mess hall in a cadence 
unchanged by the passing of 150 years 
tradition is the lifeblood of virginia military institute a 
small public college defending its maleonly admissions policy from 
a lawsuit by the federal government what some graduates call the 
second war of northern aggression 
the first skirmish in the sexdiscrimination lawsuit will be may 
4 in us district court in roanoke 
the us justice department claims vmis admissions policy is a 
chauvinistic anachronism that is unconstitutional and violates the 
civil rights act 
we believe the justice department is wrong and we intend to 
fight said maj gen john knapp vmi superintendent 
the vast majority of cadets and alumni believe admitting women 
to the corps would ruin the schools mission of producing 
citizensoldiers 
the academic training and the strict honor code would remain 
they say but the camaraderie achieved through living in close 
quarters and surviving a grueling physical and psychological 
freshman year would be changed forever 
the 1300 cadets all live in a threestory fortresslike 
dormitory the spartan rooms have no telephones posters 
television sets curtains or locks on the doors and the 
standardized cots shelves and desks are made of bare wood 
the cadets awake to reveille at 655 am and head to communal 
showers 
women they say just wouldnt fit in 
how could a cadet bust into the room of a lady at any time and 
order her to do pushups asked antonio zang a cadet from 
fairfax were taught here to be gentlemen how can you yell at a 
lady and still be a gentleman 
the lawsuit was prompted by a letter from a northern virginia 
teenage girl who complained that she could not attend the school 
vmi and the citadel in charleston sc are the only 
statesupported military schools in the nation that refuse to admit 
women the justice department is investigating the citadel for a 
possible sexdiscrimination case 
ironically virginias first female attorney general mary sue 
terry is defending vmi in the lawsuit which also names as 
defendants gov douglas wilder the nations first black elected 
governor and the state system of higher education

it is a safe bet that on sunday youre not going 
to see a starstudded special called just say no to rain 
forests 
this is because sunday is earth day an army of ecologyminded 
celebrities will be on tv then earnestly urging you to save the 
planet and to fight pollution global warming and maybe even bad 
breath 
as you may have noticed though earth day warmups already are 
under way today for example the scheduled guests on geraldo 
riveras syndicated talk show include noted ecocelebs olivia 
newtonjohn and john denver 
denver a spokesman says will sing his new song ravens 
child described as dedicated to saving the earth 
tonight at 1130 pm edt cbs has save the planet a cbshard 
rock cafe special in which katey sagal bobcat goldthwait and 
assorted rock stars gather to joke sing and ponder the environment 
an advance tape of that show wasnt available for screening 
neither was one for abcs twohour ecoextravaganza the earth 
day special which features more than 40 stars ranging from jane 
fonda to the toxic rappers 
however an abc spokeswoman describes that show airing sunday 
at 9 pm edt as an ecological fable in it bette midler plays an 
abused mother earth who collapses in a town square during an earth 
day celebration 
midler chastizes robin williams cast as an everyman for not 
taking better care of her then shes whisked to a hospital where 
the staff includes the compassionate dana delany of china beach 
and so it will go with song comedy and vignettes all aimed at 
raising the viewers consciousness about the environment and 
showing possible solutions for that which threatens the earth 
cable tv also has a number of earth dayrelated shows afoot 
among them the discovery channels amazonia about the 
brazilian rain forest that airs tonight when the baby boomer vh1 
channel also starts a series of programs on environmental issues 
that will continue through sunday 
the arts amp entertainment cable network will have a onehour 
sunday special challenge of the seas with hostnarrator ted 
danson the show starts a 26part weekly documentary series about 
the ocean 
danson of course is a costar of cheers it sure would be 
nice if some day an oceanographer got to host and narrate that 
show 
as youd expect ted turners cable empire perhaps the only tv 
giant with a vice president for environmental policy also is 
noting earth day 
it has four environmental specials scheduled sunday two of them 
reruns on his tnt network and two new shows a national geographic 
special and a cousteau society special to be shown by his tbs 
superstation 
and his cable news network world report on sunday will 
feature an ambitious twohour collection of reports on 
environmental issues in more than 40 countries 
the news divisions of abc nbc and cbs which have given 
extensive coverage to environmental issues this week will again be 
rife with earth day reports on sunday starting with their morning 
programs 
local stations will be active too although not on as large a 
scale as nbc affiliate krontv in san francisco it has put 
together an earth day weekend network of 120 stations to carry two 
specials 
the first is the taped onehour earth day 1990 a users guide 
to saving the environment hosted by dennis weaver 
the second fed live to participating east coast stations at 
1130 pm edt sunday is earth day tonight a halfhour wrapup 
of earth day doings around the nation that show will be anchored 
by linda ellerbee 
unlike some reporters who may be cynics she takes a benign view 
toward all those hollywood ecological stars wholl be all over tv 
on sunday 
i suppose its easy to make fun of the whole notion of the 
celebrities who are joining in she says but this is one of 
those situations where i guess as loud a noise as can be made is 
good 
the best thing that can be said for them is that by making 
such a loud noise theyre helping create a climate where some 
things can be done

dean kahler hugged the grass of the practice 
football field bullets were ricocheting off the blacktop road no 
more than 40 feet away 
oh my god theyre firing he said to himself 
then a sudden sting not much more than a pin prick at his back 
it was the only pain he felt he would never walk again 
a bullet fired through jeffrey millers mouth and skull slammed 
him to the ground as his blood pooled along a concrete curb a 
14yearold runaway knelt over him in anguish her arms flung 
skyward her face contorted in bewildered terror 
a 13second fusillade by national guardsmen turned antiwar 
dissent into disaster on a may monday 20 years ago at kent state 
university 
four students were killed and nine others wounded stunning a 
nation already fragmented by five years of a distant conflict 
by april 1970 more than 100 young americans and probably 
thousands of vietnamese north and south were dying each week in 
distant jungles and rice paddies but now the war had claimed 
victims at home four kids on a bluecollar campus amid the 
pancakeflat farmfields of ohio 
even so a gallup poll taken for newsweek within days of the 
shootings indicated that 58 percent of the public blamed the 
demonstrators and backed the ohio guardsmen the mourning parents 
received hate mail 
almost three more years would pass before the united states 
ended its military role in vietnam although some families of the 
dead believe the kent state killings hastened that end 
i believe the war in vietnam was brought to a quicker close 
because of it said florence schroeder of lorain ohio whose 
19yearold son william died that day that is our only reason 
to have ever filed the lawsuits to make sure the event gets its 
proper historical significance 
the significance of dead students on american soil was powerful 
dissent against us involvement in vietnam had built slowly since 
combat troops were sent in march 1965 but by 1970 campuses were 
in turmoil over the increasingly unpopular war 
president richard nixon was seen as the villain and he returned 
the sentiment in kind the president assailed the more vocal 
antiwar protesters as bums his vice president spiro agnew 
suggested in april that universities deal with their protesters 
like nazis the next time a mob of students waving their 
nonnegotiable demands starts pitching bricks and rocks at the 
student union just imagine they are wearing brown shirts or white 
sheets and act accordingly 
adding to the boiling tension was the fact that every young 
mans birthday was potentially a ticket to vietnam from 1969 to 
1973 the military draft was a lottery based on birth dates 
the black cloud of vietnam and the draft were hanging over 
their heads said kahler then a 20yearold freshman and 
conscientious objector from canton ohio 
thomas lough was one of many professors who felt they didnt 
dare give a male student a failing grade that would kill him 
said lough who teaches sociology at kent state theyd be 
eligible for selective service if they were flunked out of school 
their lives were on the line 
on april 30 student dissenters around the country listened in 
disbelief as nixon announced on nationwide television the invasion 
of neutral cambodia by us troops bent on destroying communist 
border sanctuaries 
just the previous july nixon had begun a phased withdrawal and 
tens of thousands of american men were already back home now 
americans were fighting on a new front some students had lost 
brothers and childhood friends in the war they didnt want to kill 
or to be killed protests broke out at onethird of the nations 
2500 colleges 
the day after nixons speech perhaps 500 antiwar protesters 
rallied peacefully at noon on the kent state commons then planned 
to gather again monday 
but that night the first warm evening of the year a small 
crowd of students and townies spilled from a string of bars in 
downtown kent early festiveness turned to angry shouts and 
antiwar slogans a passing police cruiser dodged beer bottles 
the crowd by midnight swollen to 500 people lit a bonfire in 
the street and began smashing shop windows 
the mayor declared a civil emergency imposed a curfew closed 
the bars and summoned the national guard thrown rocks slightly 
injured four or five officers police forced the students back onto 
campus with tear gas 
the violence continued on saturday night the campus rotc 
building was burned down demonstrators threw rocks at firefighters 
and slashed their hoses the arsonists were never identified or 
arrested 
the national guard arrived in the midst of the chaos one convoy 
was stoned as it approached the campus the guardsmen were already 
weary pulled away from patrolling interstate highways during a 
truckers strike 
when they were called out again to patrol monday morning 
nobody had any sleep to amount to anything recalled sgt leon 
smith of beach city ohio 
that same morning alan canfora a 21yearold junior from 
barberton ohio left for the noon rally carrying a black flag his 
banner of mourning for yet another vietnam casualty 
even before the cambodia invasion more americans were dying 
every day the toll was grim 335 killed in january 385 in 
february 442 in march one of the april victims was canforas 
childhood friend 
canfora upset at his friends death and by the presence of the 
guardsmen on campus joined 200 to 300 student protesters gathered 
at the commons as other students left class for lunch the crowd 
grew to as many as 2000 many of them on the hill behind the main 
knot of demonstrators 
many of the dissenters talked angrily about the guardsmen the 
curfew and the universitys ban on rallies announced the day 
before they considered the last an attack on their rights to free 
speech and assembly 
i felt so strongly against the war canfora said in an 
interview i was willing to risk my own life and face those 
rifles i chose the black flag because of the sad state of affairs 
on our campus and in our country 
to enforce the ban on rallies guardsmen drove past in a jeep 
ordering students through a bullhorn to leave the commons 
pigs off campus the students shouted 
sieg heil they chanted mocking the nazi salute 
students hurled stones at the jeep and guardsmen retaliated 
with a burst of tear gas canisters the students tossed them back 
within moments however the nearly 100 guardsmen had fixed 
their bayonets and loaded their weapons mostly m1 rifles they 
advanced on the students scattering them in retreat over the hill 
and down the other side onto the football field and parking lot

as the students retreated allison krause a freshman honors 
student from pittsburgh who had just turned 19 turned to her 
boyfriend and sobbed why are they doing this to us why dont 
they let us be she cursed the soldiers and threw rocks 
the guardsmen regrouped on the practice field knelt and aimed 
their rifles at students in the parking lot but other students had 
regrouped behind them realizing they were outflanked the 
guardsmen rose and marched back up the hill to resume their 
original position on the commons 
they were under bombardment from stones and obscenities but the 
nearest students were at least 60 feet away as the guardsmen 
neared the top of the hill they suddenly turned rifles at their 
shoulders 
the gunfire stunned the students many began running others 
dropped to the ground some thinking the guardsmen were firing 
blanks stood their ground until they heard the bullets hitting 
around them 
joseph lewis jr an 18yearold freshman from massillon ohio 
and probably closest to the guardsmen was shot as he made an 
obscene gesture a guardsman later said he believed lewis was 
advancing on him lewis was hit just below the waist and slammed to 
the ground 
i felt like being hit in the stomach with a shovel he said 
i thought i was dying i prayed another bullet hit his left 
leg 
canfora about 75 yards away was shot in the right wrist i 
got behind a tree thats what saved my life he said im 
convinced they were shooting at me intentionally i could hear 
bullets hitting the tree i could hear bullets zipping and cracking 
through the air and through the grass on both sides of the tree 
sixtyone shots were fired from at least 28 weapons 
allison krause fell mortally wounded 100 yards away from the 
guardsmen a bullet through her chest the body of 20yearold jeff 
miller of plainview ny dropped 90 yards from the rifles 
the fbi said krause and miller were initially at the front of 
the crowd taunting the guardsmen miller made some offensive 
gestures and miss krause shouted obscenities the report said but 
neither was in a position to pose even a remote danger to the 
national guard at the time of the firing 
sandy scheuer 20 of boardman ohio and schroeder were walking 
to class each was about 130 yards from the guardsmen schroeder 
was shot in the back after diving to the ground scheuer was shot 
through the neck 
i was scared said sgt smith who fired one shot into the 
air i felt my life was in danger i had a fellow coming at me 
with what looked like a brick in his hand i had no intention of 
hurting anybody or killing anybody 
what prompted the shootings remains a mystery the fbi said it 
could only speculate one theory is that a guardsman either fired 
in panic or shot intentionally at a student and the other 
guardsmen fired at the sound of the first shot 
the presidents commission on campus unrest said that although 
the actions of some students were violent criminal dangerous 
reckless and irresponsible the indiscriminate firing of rifles 
into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were 
unnecessary unwarranted and inexcusable 
a portage county special grand jury found that the guardsmen 
acted in selfdefense and exonerated them of criminal charges it 
indicted 25 students and faculty members including canfora lewis 
and lough the professor those charges were dropped in december 
1971 
in march 1974 a federal grand jury in cleveland indicted eight 
guardsmen on charges of violating the civil rights of the dead and 
wounded students midway through the trial a judge dropped all 
charges for lack of evidence 
the wounded students and the families of the dead settled a 40 
million civil suit out of court in january 1979 for 675000 but 
more important to them they said was a signed acknowledgment by 
the defendants gov james a rhodes and 27 guardsmen that the 
shootings should not have occurred and that the confrontation could 
have been resolved in other ways 
after years of debate over an appropriate memorial a granite 
plaza with four prominent upright slabs is being dedicated may 4 on 
a 2acre site adjacent to the parking lot where the students were 
killed 
a bouquet of 58175 gold daffodils already blooms around the 
memorial one for each american man and woman killed in vietnam 
for florence schroeder the daffodils are a living memorial more 
valuable than quarried granite her son she explains used to pick 
her wild flowers when he was a schoolboy she says she will plant 
one more daffodil at the memorial 
for him

june romeo is back at kent state a generation 
after witnessing national guard bullets kill four students and 
wound nine more the tears still come easily 
its funny the 38yearold nursing instructor and graduate 
student said they said 13 seconds of gunfire when you stop to 
think one two three four if you count thats a long time 
romeo then an 18yearold freshman from westlake ohio was 
about 20 steps from one of the wounded tom grace you dont 
believe it at first she said no one had ever shot a student 
protester before 
the violence and its emotioncharged aftermath became too much 
for romeo she left campus the next year upset by such scenes as a 
cafeteria confrontation between students joking about the shootings 
and others who were irate 
it was not the right place for me said romeo who tried 
selling insurance then enrolled at baldwinwallace college a small 
liberal arts school in berea near her hometown 
i kept thinking i should go back but i never did said 
romeo who keeps a candle from the first campus anniversary 
memorial may 4 1971 twenty years later she has come back as a 
graduate student and instructor in educational theory 
the tragedy was very personal said romeo whose 
undergraduate students occasionally note her resemblance to the 
young woman whose searing photographic image arms raised high over 
a dying kent state student won a pulitzer prize 
romeo said she pushed the shootings out of her mind along with 
other campus memories she lost track of classmates and roommates 
she collected but never read almost every book about the 
shootings and student unrest in 1970 
i wanted things connected with it she said of the books 
her husband has read the books but the two dont talk about may 
4 
romeo says the only person with whom she discussed kent state in 
detail was a physician and former navy officer who convinced her 
that the guardsmen would never have fired without a command 
that more than anything else has bothered me i cant 
conceive of a mind that would give an order like that she said 
pausing to catch her breath at the thought 
romeos emotions were rekindled four years ago when james 
rhodes who as ohio governor had ordered the national guard onto 
the kent state campus to restore order was a patient at the 
cleveland clinic where romeo was a nurse 
the softspoken romeo said her loathing for rhodes and his role 
in what happened was so strong that she took a day or two off while 
rhodes was hospitalized 
i kept thinking i want so much for him to feel some of the 
terror those people felt she said that really brought it 
back i never had feelings like that about anyone i really cant 
think of people i hate 
romeo returned to kent state fulltime last year she credits 
her social activism for her return to campus and her efforts to 
deal with memories of the shootings she runs a program in 
clevelands inner city that teaches youngsters to read and write as 
well as how to make reasoned decisions that will affect their lives 
i need to help people become aware she said aware of 
choices and consequences 
romeo believes that few among the couple thousand kent state 
students protesting the war on may 4 1970 were aware of the 
potential consequences she teaches her students that youre 
going to have to decide for yourselves what battles are important 
to fight and what arent worth your time and effort 
when her students learn she was a student of the 70s they are 
curious about the period she tells them she favored weird 
clothes and wore her hair long and flowing 
i even wore flowers in my hair she tells them they said 
noooo 
romeo brushes aside the current campus brouhaha over whether the 
granite memorial to be dedicated on the 20th anniversary of the 
shootings is too little too late 
i dont care that much about the memorial she said i 
think the most fitting thing is to keep the whole thing alive 
people 20 years down the line should really be questioning it it 
should be studied like we study wars

twenty years later the survivors mostly 
poor peasants still remember the terror of the american warplanes 
and the many who could not evade their fury 
hok nhem says the planes killed four of her 10 children and 
destroyed her fine concrete house two youngsters died at play in a 
village street two older children were felled by strafing jets in 
the rice paddies 
to this very day i dont know why the americans bombed our 
village said choi sandal she recalls the afternoon when six 
jets swooped down and she sprinted home from the fields to try to 
save her grandparents but was held back by flames shooting as high 
as the coconut trees 
for five years in a brutal aerial bombardment kept secret from 
the american public us planes often b52 bombers savaged the 
countryside around this remote town and other border areas of 
eastern cambodia 
in the spring of 1970 american soldiers came on foot president 
richard nixon ordered the invasion to finally destroy border 
sanctuaries used by vietnamese communists 
to protect our men who are in vietnam and to guarantee the 
continued success of our withdrawal and vietnamization program i 
have concluded that the time has come for action nixon announced 
on television april 30 1970 a day earlier american and south 
vietnamese troops had begun operation total victory 
the invasion prompted antiwar demonstrations across the united 
states at kent state university in ohio four students were shot 
dead by national guardsmen 
in cambodia some historians say the invasion was the catalyst 
for a chain reaction of national tragedies villagers here dont 
make such subtle linkages they do say that since that time they 
have known only suffering 
the pattern of vietnam is being repeated said an associated 
press dispatch from the front the american troops are putting 
the torch to homes because they may be useful to the communists 
livestock is shot for the same reason 
some of the worst damage was inflicted on snuol and mimot 
described by the americans as an enemy hub snuol was all but 
razed when troops entered the once picturesque town they found the 
charred bodies of one girl one woman and two men 
mimot was partly destroyed by air strikes after north vietnamese 
in the town fired on us helicopters it is pretty well blown 
away reported one american officer 
today ox carts roll down the towns red dirt main street past 
buildings still scarred by shrapnel long strips of twostory 
shophouses were rebuilt only in the last several years said 
deputy district chief rin saman 
rin saman who was in mimot during the invasion said the bombed 
sugar factory where he worked remains inoperative and much of the 
vast rubber plantation on the edge of town still lies in ruins 
only traces remain of what was a hospital for plantation workers 
by the end of june 1970 the invasion force of 63000 including 
23000 americans had returned to south vietnam according to the 
us command 339 americans 799 south vietnamese and more than 
11000 communist soldiers were killed and vast amounts of communist 
supplies destroyed in the operation 
but cambodia would never heal the invasion had created a new 
battle front dragged all of cambodia into the indochinese 
conflict and started years of national agony 
the capital city of phnom penh as well as the usbacked 
government of lon nol fell to the khmer rouge guerrillas april 17 
1975 two weeks before the fall of saigon what followed was the 
ghastly ultrarevolution of the victors 
mimots inhabitants were driven into rural communes or forced 
into slave labor on the rubber plantation press samoeur deputy 
governor of kompong cham province which surrounds mimot estimates 
360000 inhabitants of the province perished under the 197578 rule 
of khmer rouge leader pol pot some say craters from the b52 
bombings were used for mass graves 
nationwide estimates of deaths by execution starvation and 
disease in the killing fields of pol pot range as high as 3 
million in a country that had 73 million inhabitants in 1975 
it was harder to survive under pol pot than under american 
bombs said rin saman 
in 1978 the area was invaded again this time by the vietnamese 
who punched across the border on christmas day to oust the khmer 
rouge today the khmer rouge are onethird of an antigovernment 
coalition supported by the united states 
us aggressors bombed schools roads bridges hospitals 
markets they razed peoples homes they sprayed chemicals on the 
rubber plantations press samoeur said in an interview and 
until this day the us government still has a distorted view of 
what is happening in cambodia 
choi sandal now 38 is still haunted by the sight of her 
grandparents charred remains in the stillsmoldering village 
where only one of 60 houses survived the aerial attack 
the aging widow hok nhem posed for a photo before a house built 
on the ruins of the concrete one only one pillar remains of the 
old atop which she has placed an aviary for doves 
other survivors joined them talking openly with this reporter 
the first american most had met in 20 years a toothless old man 
was overheard suggesting the reporter might be there to assess 
damage for future us reparations 
but nobody openly mentioned this nor exhibited the slightest 
hostility instead they clasped their hands together in the 
traditional prayerlike gesture of farewell and offered a glass 
of sweet coconut milk

every spring just as surely as the 
daffodils sad memories bloom again 
in the spring of 1970 in his last letter home from college 
william schroeder altered a few lines from a popular neil young 
song i am a child to tell his mother he loved her and savored 
weekends spent at home 
i am a child i last awhile 
you cant perceive all the pleasure in my smile 
you make the rules you say whats fair 
its lots of fun to have you there 
twenty springs have come and gone since may 4 1970 when 
william schroeder and three other students were gunned down by 
national guardsmen at antiwar demonstrations on the kent state 
university campus 
but the annual arrival of spring cannot erase the pain felt for 
missing sons and daughters for friends lost forever for 
graduations unattended and anniversaries uncelebrated 
even after 20 years it still hurts said florence schroeder 
who lives in lorain they took him away but they cant wipe out 
the memory 
schroeders mother can still recite her voice breaking the 
words from the neil young song but sometimes the memories are too 
painful for her and her husband louis 
at the end of the trials she said we promised ourselves 
wed never go that far down deep into our souls again it hurts too 
much 
schroeder 19 was shot in the back while lying on the ground 
he took cover when the gunfire began as he walked to class after a 
meeting with his rotc adviser 
he was concerned that the military program paying his 
scholarship might be discontinued because demonstrators had burned 
down the rotc building two days earlier the vietnam war tormented 
schroeder his mother said because he knew he would end up there 
flowers and bullets is the name of an album of remembrances 
put together for allison krauses parents by her college boyfriend 
on her tombstone is the epitaph flowers are better than bullets 
may 3 1970 
may 3 a sunday provided a sunny peaceful respite from campus 
rumblings as allison a freshman honors student from pittsburgh 
who had just turned 19 and her boyfriend strolled the campus they 
encountered a soldier with a lilac in his gun barrel 
when his commanding officer ridiculed him and pulled the lilac 
from the rifle allison grabbed it before he could toss it down as 
the officer walked away allison yelled after him 
whats the matter with peace flowers are better than 
bullets 
her father arthur krause spent a decade seeking the justice he 
and the other kent families as they came to call themselves 
felt was due them 
in the final court settlement of a 40 million civil suit in 
january 1979 the four families and nine wounded students received 
675000 to be divided among them but more important to them they 
said was a signed statement of regret and acknowledgment from ohio 
gov james a rhodes and 27 guardsmen that the shootings should not 
have occurred 
arthur krause died of cancer in 1988 his widow doris feels 
only rancor toward kent state she says she will never return under 
any official invitation not even for dedication of a memorial that 
will mark the 20th anniversary of her daughters slaying 
ill be bitter to the day i die mrs krause said she 
recalls with anger how she learned of allisons death only by 
calling the hospital after a reporter told her allison had been 
wounded 
would you not expect to hear something from that university 
she asked would you not expect to see an official at the 
hospital where you went to see your dead child to extend a hand to 
tell you what happened 
theyve never done that their letter of sympathy was a check 
a refund made out to allison for spring tuition she wasnt around 
to cash it 
jeff miller left behind an antiwar poem he wrote when he was 16 
a teenager from a small ohio farm clutches his side in 
pain 
and as he feels his life ebbing away he too asks why 
why is he dying here thousands of miles from home 
the war without a purpose marches on relentlessly 
not stopping to mourn for its dead 
content to wait for its end 
but all the frightened parents who still have their sons 
fear that the end is not in sight 
four years later he lay dying in a pool of blood a bullet 
through his skull it was his body that a 14yearold runaway mary 
ann vecchio knelt over in the famous photograph her arms 
outstretched in anguish her face filled with terror 
his mother elaine holstein of new york city is still shaken by 
his poem 
its always struck me as strange and ironic that he refers to 
a teenager from a small ohio farm she said never knowing 
that he himself would die four years later in a small ohio farm 
town 
among the mementos sarah and martin scheuer of boardman ohio 
have kept for 20 years is an anniversary card from their younger 
daughter 20yearold sandra 
her note had urged them to dine at a chinese restaurant and 
enjoy their 27th wedding anniversary that may 4 honorable wish 
for happy anniversary to honorable couple who still have big yen 
for each other 
but celebration turned to mourning the card arrived the same 
day sandy lay dead in a parking lot felled by a bullet through her 
neck as she walked to a speech therapy class 
how would you like to identify your child in a morgue mrs 
scheuer asked 20 years later

dean kahler has only to look down to remember that day a rifle 
bullet made him a paraplegic and put him in a wheelchair for life 
i know why im sitting in it kahler said ill never 
really forget kent state 
kahler then a 20yearold freshman from canton ohio had 
worked nearly a year in a steel mill to help pay for school when 
rifle fire crackled over the shouts of his fellow students he fell 
to the ground to take cover he felt a sensation like a bee sting 
it was a bullet ripping into his spinal cord 
kahler a conscientious objector was the most seriously injured 
of the nine persons wounded he finished school seven years later 
then built a career in state government working for the secretary 
of state and attorney general he was elected an athens county 
commissioner in 1984 and reelected four years later 
kahler divorced in 1984 married a counselor he met in a pub 
last august he frequently drives the 340mile round trip to kent 
state for sports and alumni events he is a guest lecturer for a 
regularly offered course that examines the kent state shootings and 
their aftermath 
kent state is not something i carry around as a burden he 
said just because i had one bad day at kent doesnt mean the 
whole university should be condemned to me whats more 
important is the county budget and my family and the rest of my 
life 
but for sarah and martin scheuer much of their life died in a 
13second volley of gunfire 
it ruined our lives said scheuer now 79 and suffering from 
parkinsons disease 
as the seasons come and go so do may 4 wedding anniversaries 
unmarked uncelebrated nor can mrs scheuer bear the fragrance of 
springtime lilacs 
id like to bring them all inside i love them all so much 
sandy told her mother when mrs scheuer visited her apartment two 
days before she died those were the last words her mother ever 
heard her speak 
i try not to look at them said mrs scheuer it just 
makes me feel sad

president alfredo cristianis 
government has brought charges against soldiers in the massacre of 
six jesuit priests but investigations of other alleged military 
atrocities seem to go nowhere 
unless the killings cause an uproar abroad nothing gets 
done said a judge who for a time was dealing with the case of 
seven young men slain nov 18 a witness said they were lined up 
against a wall and shot by soldiers 
no witness or complainant came forward by the end of november 
and the judge referred the case to the next higher justice 
coming forward to testify would be a real risk the judge 
said the case will be under investigation until it is 
forgotten 
the young men were killed in the poor cuscatancingo neighborhood 
of san salvador two days after troopers of the elite ustrained 
atlacatl battalion massacred six jesuit priests who taught at 
central american university their housekeeper and her daughter 
those killings shocked the world the united states which gives 
el salvador more than 1 million a day in aid put pressure on the 
cristiani administration to identify and punish the people 
responsible 
a colonel and three lieutenants have been charged but critics 
say others were involved 
such charges are an exception in a country where members of the 
armed forces or militarybacked death squads are believed to have 
murdered thousands of people they suspect of being leftists 
despite a wealth of evidence no officer has been convicted of a 
crime involving politically motivated abuse of human rights in el 
salvador 
no officer had even been charged until march 1989 when a major 
was indicted for killings he has not been tried 
the attention given the jesuit case is exceptional the 
treatment of the cuscatancingo case has become the norm in a decade 
of civil war 
as long as our military men do not understand the meaning of 
the administration of justice and that they too are subject to 
it we will have no justice and no improvement in respect for 
human rights said maria julia hernandez director of the roman 
catholic church legal aid office 
the cuscatancingo killings were barely noticed during an 
offensive by leftist guerrillas that convulsed san salvador and 
three other cities for two weeks 
attorney general mauricio colorado who has dealt with dozens of 
foreign officials checking on the jesuit investigation said he had 
not even heard of the case 
there were a hundred cases like that of bodies found in the 
street colorado said when told of it he suggested the victims 
were guerrillas or were killed in a cross fire 
the seven bodies were found sprawled at the foot of a 
bloodstained wall the only wall on the street pocked by bullets 
two victims still clutched social security cards in their hands in 
what the witness described as an effort to identify themselves as 
workmen 
colorado acknowledged that us pressure has spurred some 
investigations and said justice should work for everybody not 
just for the americans 
in cuscatancingo two young men said they fled the scene as 
soldiers ordered the others into the street 
one spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity he 
expressed fear that soldiers would kill him if he accused them 
openly 
he and the others were sitting along a sidewalk nov 18 when an 
army patrol spotted them and ordered them into the main road the 
young man said 
most of them reached for identity cards and obeyed the order 
but the young man said he told his brother and a friend all out of 
sight at the end of the line that the three should run 
his brother said he had nothing to worry about and went with the 
group the young man said but he and the friend ran up a side 
street 
five minutes later they heard a volley of shots followed by 
single shots coups de grace and his brother and the others 
were dead he told the ap 
family members reported the killings to a justice of the peace 
who inspected the scene 
the judge who first dealt with the case said only a formal 
complaint from the young man could activate an investigation and 
i can only offer him security up to a certain point 
he also said coming forward probably would not make much 
difference 
we judges supposedly are the authority and the police 
supposedly are the auxiliary organs but the reality is very 
different he said on condition of anonymity 
i would have to depend on the police which are part of the 
armed forces to investigate the armed forces you see where that 
puts us 
proceso the weekly publication of central american university 
published an article in february on the cuscatancingo slayings 
three months after the two massacres those materially 
responsible for the murder of the jesuits have been arrested and 
charged it said the murderers of the seven young men in 
cuscatancingo on the other hand remain unpunished 
the contrast between the two cases is a example of how little 
the countrys judicial system has been consolidated 
notwithstanding the trumpeted advances the government has 
proclaimed with regard to the jesuit case

buffeted by the recent death of its god and 
a drop in donations the commune of the late freelove guru osho 
rajneesh is trying to save itself by going mainstream 
emphasis has shifted from mystical sex to meditation exercises 
primal screaming was banned after neighbors complained of the 
noise deals have been signed with prominent companies for 
distribution of video cassettes 
we are mellowing said swami tatahgat an indian board 
member of rajneesh foundation the trust that controls the commune 
before we used to wear our rebelliousness on our sleeves 
it appears to be a kinder gentler commune at poona a far cry 
from the days in rajneeshpuram ore when commune members poisoned 
each other for being negative in those days rajneesh called 
himself bhagwan or god 
no longer do disciples prance halfnaked through the halls of 
the local fivestar hotel the blue diamond the hotel recently 
welcomed them back but only for meals 
the lush 11acre campus with its miniature waterfalls outdoor 
japanese restaurant and hightech workout rooms seems more like a 
summer camp for adults than a focus for worldwide revolution in 
consciousness 
all visitors are required to produce the results of an aids test 
no more than a month old westerners seen groping at one anothers 
bodies on poonas streets may get a talking to by other followers 
osho mediatation is taught at the tata management school a 
poona business college the commune has a contract with cbsindia 
to distribute videotapes of rajneeshs lectures and another with 
pocket books to publish his writings

this is where osho had his teeth fixed swami subhuti a

in the early 1980s rajneesh moved his band of redrobed 
followers to a 64229acre ranch in the hills of central oregon 
rancho rajneesh disbanded after the master was kicked out of the 
united states in 1985 for immigration fraud and the american 
movement degenerated into a miasma of poisonings and costly court 
cases 
ma anand sheela rajneeshs former chief aide was sentenced to 
4 years in prison for arson attempted murder and masterminding a 
foodpoisoning outbreak that made 750 people sick other aides 
avoided prosecution by cooperating with police 
rajneesh advocated breaking with all social conventions through 
meditation as he defined it 
through meditation he said his followers could destroy the 
family the church and the state structures he said were 
destroying humanity 
he developed or synthesized several techniques including one in 
which followers jump up and down yelling hoo hoo hoo 
unlike gurus who demanded that disciples reject worldly goods 
rajneesh encouraged his followers to revel in sensual pleasures 
including sex drugs and good food 
only by this way will you ever rise above them he said in 
one of his famous discourses which he peppered with bathroom humor 
and intriguing riddles 
those who succeeded in meditation the guru said would attain 
buddhahood or enlightenment they would be able to live in the 
world unaffected by its changes 
what osho taught is that the next jump for humanity is not 
changing the shape of your nose or face but changing the shape of 
your inner space said swami amrito a british doctor who was 
with rajneesh when he died 
rajneesh returned to india in 1986 and problems followed the 
movement home 
after his death the indian press speculated that rajneesh was 
murdered or died of aids his followers denied the claims and 
accused the united states of poisoning their god while he was in 
jail 
indian newspapers claimed westerners were trying to seize 
control of the movement the commune also rejected that claim 
a mysterious team of 21 people called the inner circle 
runs the commune an american swami jayesh and the british 
doctor swami amrito are believed to be in charge 
negative publicity has hurt donations which routinely reached 
millions of dollars a year 
swami tatahgat the indian board member said the commune did 
not plan to expand its campus because we dont have the funds 
last year the commune lost a court case and was forced to pay the 
indian government 2 million in back taxes

disciples pass a metal detector then a duo of sniffing women

fame came early for drs james cimino and 
michael brescia but they ditched life in the limelight for the 
quieter rewards of treating patients dying of cancer 
they insist repeatedly that theyre no heroes we arent 
saintly said cimino whatever people do they do with the 
motivation of selfgratification 
they praise coworkers at calvary hospital in the bronx and 
speak with awe of the nuns who founded the hospital 
we took a road says brescia to the left it looked shiny 
and gold but to the right it looked happier to us 
they came to the crossroads 25 years ago when as internists at 
the veterans administration hospital in the bronx they developed a 
procedure now widely used in kidney dialysis 
medical journals touted their achievement research 
opportunities rolled in they were invited to speak at conventions 
they were offered an entire westchester county hospital for a 
token 1 if they would turn it into a kidney center 
instead they chose the daytoday rewards at calvary the 
nations only acute care hospital devoted exclusively to advanced 
cancer patients 
we didnt go home if someone was suffering said brescia 
we learned to live with tiny victories the patient was able to 
eat today or go to church or sit in a chair or play with her 
children were mature enough to accept that 
without that attitude he conceded a patient could put 
tremendous anxiety in you by looking at you and expecting what 
cannot be done those pleading eyes looking at you telling you 
that youve failed 
in 1961 cimino director of renal services at the va hospital 
began spending a few hours a week as an adviser at calvary then 
brescia one of his residents joined him gradually it became 
their lifes work 
we felt this was a mission said brescia who like cimino 
is a father of six we saw unbearable suffering of patients and 
families that we as physicians could relieve 
it was an adventure said brescia but i wasnt unhappy 
taking it to me it looked good and right 
cimino became medical director and brescia his assistant under 
their leadership calvary won accreditation 
the two capitalized on their fame to lure other doctors to 
calvary in 1980 they dropped their titles to become assistants to 
the medical director and senior attending physicians mostly they 
were just doctors and the patients think thats just fine 
i came from another hospital said vivian dowling this is 
heaven in comparison and im not just saying that because the 
doctor is here 
i love vivian shes brave and courageous said brescia 
when you work with patients like this the things you thought 
were important you get home and somebody went through the garage 
door dont mean anything 
calvary unlike a hospice is a fullfledged hospital it uses 
medical treatments to slow the spread of cancer fight other 
ailments brought on by the disease and alleviate pain but the 
emphasis is on comfort rather than cures 
miss dowling for instance came here in terrible pain not 
from the cancer but from a hole in her back said brescia 57 
i cured the hole now shes a whole person 
cimino and brescia maintain that even in an era of hospices and 
patient rights the terminally ill often are shunted to the back 
wards of big hospitals and ignored by busy doctors 
some oncologists are not able to work here they want to see 
the patients get well said cimino 60 a place like this could 
be very defeating for persons with that attitude thats why so 
many of these kind of places are led by religious groups 
one of the worst things in this stage of life is to feel that 
youre not worthy of the attention of a professional cimino 
added 
its not uncommon for doctors at calvary to telephone a patient 
on a holiday new patients are presented with a rose there is a 
free beauty parlor and barber even the security guards are told 
to be gentle everything is done with human dignity said brescia 
its equally important for the doctors to comfort the 
families he said the families have been through hell theyre 
devastated sometimes we sit them down with a cup of coffee were 
trying to undo all the spiritual and emotional neglect 
many patients some of them lying on colorful gurneys also 
attend catholic protestant or jewish services in the chapel or 
watch them on closedcircuit television in their rooms 
the staff relies heavily on cancer care technicians who 
work under the supervision of registered nurses to change 
tracheotomy tubes and surgical dressings groom patients and give 
the most essential quality of care kindness and love said 
cimino 
its the philosophy of nonabandonment you keep your promises 
to the patients you never let them feel isolated he said 
and along with the attention said brescia we always leave a 
tiny bit of hope in the patient

on a fall day in 1988 botanist rajani 
nadgauda burst into her bosss office and shouted the bamboo is 
flowering 
the scientist led her boss by the hand to the greenhouse where 
in a beaker a bamboo seedling had sprouted tiny pale flowers 
like all bamboo buds they werent very pretty limp almost dry 
and close to colorless the flowers exuded no fragrance but to 
mrs nadgauda and her boss plant physiologist anthony mascarenhas 
they were beautiful 
thus began a groundbreaking experiment on the high emperor of 
all the grasses for almost two years the bamboo team at 
indias national chemical laboratory used rigorous science the 
potionmaking of a brewmaster and a good dose of superstition to 
coax successive groups of bamboo to flower the results were 
published march 22 in the british magazine nature 
the implications of coaxing a bamboo to flower in a laboratory 
are immense bamboo is an important raw material for paper and in 
construction its shoots are a popular vegetable in asia and its 
leaves and branches are used as livestock feed 
but understanding of the plant has been hampered by its bizarre 
life cycle when first growing bamboo spears shoot skyward at up 
to 16 inches per hour soaring as tall as 130 feet the grass 
flowers once every 30 years and some stands take as long as 120 
years most botanists die or retire by the time one generation of 
the tall grass dies and another flowers 
but on that fall day two years ago a glimmer of hope appeared 
if mrs nadgauda and mascarenhas could repeat the flowering they 
might be able to unlock bamboos secret with seeds from the 
flowers they could also crossbreed bamboo another first 
success could aid the fight against deforestation ravaging much 
of asia it also could increase production of bamboo success might 
even help halt the extinction of chinas giant panda which relies 
on the capricious plant for food 
using highly nutritious ingredients mascarenhas team took 
bamboo seedlings and tried to spark flowering 
we invented a powerful brew said mascarenhas we used 
coconut milk but we also added some secret things we felt a little 
like witch doctors 
the scientists showered their plant cultures with care 
you have to give love to your cultures to make them grow 
mascarenhas said of course we are scientists but we also know 
that nature moves in strange ways 
mrs nadgauda had the best luck with the cultures the 
fieryeyed 39yearold is known in the laboratory as a woman who 
does not suffer fools or stubborn cultures gladly 
if i look at the cultures angrily they grow she said i 
treat them like my children if they obey me then i love them 
mrs nadgauda said she would often place beakers of bamboo 
seedlings on her desk and glare at them in the afternoon 
the morning after one such scolding mrs nadgauda came to work 
to find her cultures had sprouted flowers the experiment had 
succeeded within a few months the bamboo team succeeded twice 
more prompting two species of bamboo to flower 
in an editorial attached to the nature article david hanke a 
professor of botany at cambridge university said the experiment 
opens up endless possibilities for the high emperor of all the 
grasses 
mascarenhas and mrs nadgauda are more modest 
we still have much work to do said mascarenhas we are 
perfecting the brew 
bamboo comprises about 500 species scattered throughout the 
world but it is in asia where it reigns supreme cutting a verdant 
swath through indias monsoon country the valleys of chinas 
yunnan and sichuan provinces over the korean peninsula and into 
japan 
in hong kong and tokyo bamboo scaffolding encases most 
construction sites on chinas farms bamboo hay feeds water 
buffalo and pigs shoots of the young bamboo are stirfried in 
shanghai and pickled in bombay in cambodia thailand and vietnam 
bamboo trunks lift farmers houses from the floodprone plains in 
bangladesh where houses and humanity are constantly swept away by 
cyclones and floods bamboo is split and woven into mats that serve 
as walls and roofs of hastily erected new dwellings 
mascarenhas hopes the bamboo team will soon be able to 
perfect the flowering experiment and begin selling the technology 
to other labs of course we love the plants he said but we 
could also use the money

did we all descend from eve an african woman 
whose offspring quite literally conquered the world 
though of course no one knows her name some biologists and 
anthropologists believe that all humanity traces its roots to just 
one woman this idea known as the eve hypothesis or the garden of 
eden theory is intriguingly simple 
eve lived in subsaharan africa 100000 to 200000 years ago as 
the ancestors of modern humans her children and grandchildren 
spread throughout africa and eventually across the world 
triggering the extinction of other primitive peoples 
or so some scientists believe 
others ridicule the idea the theory based on a comparison of 
the genes of people around the world is one of the most hotly 
conteste controversies in the oftenrancorous field of human 
origins 
at a meeting earlier this year of the american association for 
the advancement of science both sides argued their cases with 
facts speculation and sarcasm 
allan c wilson of the university of california at berkeley one 
of the architects of the eve hypothesis said the evidence is so 
strong that the argument is done clinched finished its over 
not quite countered the other side 
there are serious and obvious flaws in the eve hypothesis 
said geoffrey g pope of the university of illinois 
most everyone agrees that smallbrained humanlike creatures 
arose in africa 15 million to 2 million years ago they spread 
throughout africa europe and southeast asia and flourished for 
hundreds of thousands of years 
but what became of them the theory favored by pope and many 
fossil experts holds that those creatures known as homo erectus 
are the true ancestors of us all 
if they are right these early hominids parted company in africa 
but went on to evolve in unison useful genetic changes that arose 
in small pockets of population slowly spread throughout the world 
as neighboring tribes mingled after thousands of centuries they 
became us modern humans who differ only in superficial racial 
features 
however garden of eden theorists believe those early settlers 
disappeared leaving no trace in humanitys genes instead they say 
they have evidence that a new kind of people arose in africa much 
more recently their kin also spread throughout the prehistoric 
world somehow killing off or squeezing out the european 
neanderthals and other descendants of the first wave out of africa 
the difference between the scenarios is so stark that there 
seems to be no middle ground no room for compromise 
there is no question on this issue said alan g thorne of 
the australian national university an eve skeptic one of us is 
absolutely wrong 
the debate began about three years ago with the use of new 
scientific techniques to look for signs of the family tree inside 
the genes of modern humans this intrusion of the glitzy tools of 
molecular biology have not always been accepted graciously by the 
traditional fossil hunters who rely largely on meticulous 
measurements and comparisons of bone fragments to fathom human 
origins 
david w frayer a neanderthal expert from the university of 
kansas said the quick acceptance of eve reflects a preference for 
sensational catastrophe over mundane gradual change as well as a 
willingness of some to accept without criticism or even 
suspicion the results of molecular biology 
molecular biologys role has been to decipher the genetic 
information inside mitochondria these are structures within human 
cells that help produce energy 
mitochondria have their own genes separate from the chromosomes 
that carry all the other blueprints for human beings ordinary 
genes are a mishmash contributed equally by mothers and fathers 
mitochondrial genes are passed along only by mothers 
therefore each new generation gets an almost exact copy of the 
mitochondrial genes of their forebears the only difference is the 
occasional variation caused by genetic mutations 
these mutations are the key to reading mitochondrial genes as a 
clock biologists believe they know how quickly the mutations 
occur by comparing the degree of mutation in the genes of people 
from different parts of the world they believe they can trace the 
various lines back to the point at which they all converge eve 
the latest study of this sort conducted by linda vigilant at 
berkeley uses hair roots plucked from 199 people from europe 
asia new guinea and seven ethnic groups in africa analyzing the 
root genes she calculates all the people descended from a common 
ancestor who lived in africa 207000 years ago this females 
descendants evolved into physically modern humans by 100000 years 
ago 
as neat as the idea seems anthropologists attack it on several 
grounds 
one is whether the mutations in mitochondrial genes occur like 
clockwork the critics argue that the biologists are overly 
confident that they know the tempo at which the mitochondrial clock 
is ticking 
milford h wolpoff of the university of michigan contends the 
clocks rhythm is hopelessly thrown off by the dead ends of allboy 
families whenever a family produces no girls the orderly 
accumulation of genetic mutations stops cold no mitochondrial 
genes are passed to the next generation 
if there is a clock said thorne it needs new batteries 
other scientists point to the fossil record the teeth and bits 
of bone that remain from the ancient beings 
if the eve theory is correct the new wave of humans migrating 
out of africa 1000 centuries ago did not mate and mingle their 
genes with the ancient hominids that already lived in europe and 
asia instead they replaced them completely 
some fossil experts believe they have found clear signs that 
traits of those ancient peoples have been passed down to modern 
humans for instance pope argues that 1 millionyearold fossils 
from ancient asia have the same cheekbones and wisdom teeth as 
modern asians 
this similarity in facial features indicates that the eve 
hypothesis is completely untenable in asia 
frayer also believes he can see echoes of neanderthal skulls and 
teeth in later generations of europeans 
allison s brooks of george washington university questions eve 
on behavioral grounds she said that if modern humans overran 
europe replacing the dimwitted natives there should also have 
been a cultural revolution 
however she finds no abrupt change showing dramatically more 
advanced stone tools or hunting techniques in europe after the 
supposed arrival of eves offspring

tufts university president jean mayer one of 
the nations bestknown nutritionists has taken much of the 
confusion out of eating well and losing weight 
dr jean mayers diet amp nutrition guide written with jeanne 
p goldberg provides a compact and generally sensible path for 
children and adults but is somewhat disorganized and fairly 
conservative 
mayer and goldberg a tufts school of nutrition professor are 
widely known for their newspaper column food for thought 
written in a questionandanswer format the same device is used in 
the book at the end of each chapter which can make information 
hard to find 
for example yogurt is discussed both in the main section of a 
chapter that inclues adapting recipes to make them healthier and in 
the questionandanswer section at the end of the chapter 
with the plethora of diet plans available and labels on food 
difficult to decipher consumers need someone to cut a path through 
it all and mayer and goldberg offer reasonable advice and clear 
explanations 
their book includes information on preventing food poisoning 
eating well in restaurants vitamins and minerals food 
requirements at different ages and for those with various health 
problems or conditions and how to lose weight sensibly 
that americans are doing a poor job of feeding themselves seems 
clear 
you would probably think it outrageous if we suggested that 
our paleolithic ancestors crouching in their caves may have been 
routinely eating a better diet than do many americans today the 
authors say 
it need not be the case and beginning with a tour of the 
supermarket the authors warn that shoppers best nutritional 
interests are not always served by marketing professionals 
overall mayer and goldberg recommend a lowfat diet consisting 
of foods either fresh or lightly processed passing by many of the 
prepared foods that have come on the market in the five decades 
since the opening of the first supermarket a king kullen in new 
york 
they warn about tricky food labels an ounce of all sorts of 
cereals may have the same number of calories but an ounce of corn 
flakes is about a cup while an ounce of granola may be just 
onequarter cup manufacturers are not required to use comparable 
serving sizes and many foods have no nutrition labeling at all 
but while the authors note that labels can be vague about the 
types of fats used they do not point out that because 
manufacturers must list ingredients in descending order by weight 
various kinds of sugar wont appear all together shoppers should 
beware of how they add up 
there is plenty of information in the book on what various terms 
on labels mean how to get enough protein even in a vegetarian 
diet without eating too much fat how to adjust favorite receipes 
weightloss advice is simple and traditional eat fewer 
calories generally by cutting fats and sugar and exercise more a 
months worth of menus is included 
where government scientists or agencies clash with other groups 
the book tends to be conservative for example on pesticides it 
repeats old arguments about toxins that naturally occur in foods 
and concludes but when you mesh all these factors together and 
weigh the risks and benefits a general outcry against pesticides 
is unwarranted 
with almost half the restaurant dollars going to fastfood 
outlets the appendix listing the calorie salt and fat content of 
fastfood items from three chains is very useful 
dr jean mayers diet and nutrition guide is being published 
in april by pharos books

breastfeeding may not protect middleclass 
urban infants in developed countries from infectious disease as it 
does in the third world a new report says 
the study found no effect on rates of upper or lower respiratory 
illness an ear condition called otitis media or an inflammation 
of the stomach and intestines called gastroenteritis 
the study done in denmark involved 500 infants whose health 
and feeding practices were tracked over their first year with 
monthly questionnaires 
previous studies have shown that breast feeding protects infants 
from infectious disease in the third world but researchers have 
reached conflicting conclusions about infants in developed 
countries maybe because of how they did their studies researchers 
said in the april issue of the journal pediatrics 
the american academy of pediatrics generally endorses 
breastfeeding for fullterm infants saying it provides 
nutritional economic and psychological advantages as well as 
bolstering the infants diseasefighting immune system 
the authors of the new study said their results probably apply 
to middleclass populations in the united states but not to rural 
or poor urban populations 
the researchers were from the albert einstein college of 
medicinemontefiore medical center in new york the yale university 
school of medicine and the university of copenhagen in denmark

gases being studied as replacements for 
ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbons would contribute to global 
warming but less than chlorofluorocarbons do a study says 
chlorofluorocarbons called cfcs are used in a variety of 
products but researchers want to find replacements because cfcs 
destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere 
the ozone shields earth from solar rays that can cause skin 
cancer 
the new study notes that cfcs also promote global warming 
through the greenhouse effect because they can trap energy 
radiating from earth 
most replacement gases can also absorb that energy researchers 
said but their potential contribution to global warming is only 
about onetenth that of cfcs chiefly because they break down more 
quickly in the atmosphere researchers found 
the work is reported in the april 5 issue of the british journal 
nature by scientists at ei du pont de nemours amp co of 
wilmington del and atmospheric and environmental research inc 
of cambridge mass 
in an accompanying editorial keith shine of the university of 
reading in england said unrestrained emissions of the substitutes 
could lead to climatically significant concentrations during the 
next century so it would be important to prevent unnecessary

twenty states have expressed interest in 
distributing tennessees nutrition guide for aids patients 
nutrition and hiv your choice makes a difference is being 
prepared for its second printing twenty states have asked to see

wickwire 
the booklet is intended to give patients with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome information on keeping up their energy and 
maintaining their weight 
traditional diets dont work for them ms wickwire said 
they need the opposite of keepslim diets 
the guide also may be useful for people with other debilitating 
diseases such as cancer she said 
the booklet is the brainchild of matt nelson who heads the 
state health departments aids education and social work service 
division 
diseases that commonly strike aids patients affect what and how 
much they can eat nelson said you almost have to look at what 
disease you have and what medicines youre on then figure out what 
foods are left for you to eat 
the guide gives tips on dealing with chronic fatigue drug side 
effects and food safety nelson said aids patients cant fight 
off germs and bacteria found in raw or undercooked food he said 
the tennessee department of health and environment is making 
bookplates available to any state city or group that wants to 
print copies information on obtaining the plates is available from

the united states in february recorded its 
smallest trade deficit in more than six years a 649 billion 
imbalance that reflected a sharp drop in oil imports the 
government reported 
the bush administration which is counting on strong export 
growth this year to boost a sluggish domestic economy hailed the 
dramatic narrowing of the deficit 
but some private economists cautioned that the improvement 
reported wednesday could be shortlived saying the big drop in oil 
imports was unlikely to be sustained and the dollars strength was 
making us goods less competitive overseas

shearson lehman hutton inc paid for what 
analysts have termed the excesses of the 1980s in one 915 million 
shot in the first quarter merrill lynch amp co took its postboom 
medicine earlier and showed a profit 
the nations top two brokerage firms reported quarterly earnings 
wednesday that reflect continued problems in the securities 
industry which still is looking to recover from the 1987 stock 
market crash 
in both cases there was a slowdown in the investment banking 
sector and thats true for most of the brokerage houses said 
samuel liss a securities industry analyst with salomon brothers 
inc its a low revenue period 
shearsons 915 million loss the biggest quarterly loss in 
wall street history included a 630 million charge to pay for a 
restructuring that included about 2000 layoffs and the elimination 
or reduction of several businesses it also took a 157 million 
charge for an accounting change in the way it pays for development 
of computer software 
the restructuring was implemented after parent american express 
co moved to seize tighter control of the nations no 2 investment 
firm which has struggled during a bad period on wall street 
following broad expansion in the 1980s american express plans to 
acquire all shearson stock it does not own 
merrill lynch which reported a 16 percent profit rise took a 
470 million charge in the 1989 fourth quarter to pay for its 
restructuring those costcutting measures appeared to take hold in 
the first quarter despite a revenue drop 
merrills fourthquarter charge gave the firm its first annual 
loss since going public in 1971 merrill plans to eliminate about 
3000 jobs by the end of 1990 and is divesting some product lines 
and businesses 
merrill shearson and other wall street firms have been 
struggling because of declines in stock market activity and key 
businesses such as stock and bond underwriting and takeovers since 
the 1987 stock market crash 
the retrenchment is due in part to rapid expansion in the 1980s 
to capitalize on explosive growth in all segments of the securities 
business as business lags the major firms are forced to 
consolidate 
were saying that in these weak market conditions firms that 
generate profits are doing pretty well said jeffrey bowman who 
follows the securities industry for standard amp poors corp 
excluding its onetime charges shearson still lost 128 million 
for the quarter on its securities business 
the firstquarter operating loss before the restructuring 
charge stems from a slowdown in overall business activity and other 
firstquarter 1990 events shearson said 
the first quarter loss before the accounting change equaled 
875 per share that compared to a loss of 15 million or 24 
cents a share in the same 1989 period revenue fell 15 percent to 
26 billion from 3 billion 
shearson said it increased litigation reserves by 50 million 
added 32 million to a loanloss reserve primarily related to the 
portfolio of its boston co subsidiary and lost 34 million 
because of fluctuations in the junk bond market 
shearson said it had 54 million in income related to the 
settlement of litigation in connection with the suspension of tin 
trading by the london metal exchange in 1986 
merrill and shearson reported lower investment banking revenue 
as business remained sluggish in stock and bond underwriting and 
merchant banking merrills revenue fell 267 percent and 
shearsons 25 percent 
brokerage commission revenue was up 42 percent at merrill and 
down 53 percent at shearson 
at shearson revenue from marketmaking and principal 
transactions also fell sharply attributed in part to volatility in 
the collapsed junk bond market shearson is selling its portfolio 
of junk bonds held for investment 
merrill made 413 million or 34 cents a share in the first 
quarter compared with 355 million or 29 cents per share last 
year revenue declined to 266 billion from 279 billion

environmentally conscious investors have 
attacked some wall street funds for failing to back up claims of 
being earthfriendly merrill lynch amp co wanted to make sure it 
avoided such criticism 
with earth day approaching merrill has formed an investment 
trust composed of what it calls environmentally responsible 
companies merrill even printed literature for the trust on 
recycled paper in green biodegradable ink 
but merrill hired four outside environmental groups to help set 
up its ecological trust 1990 the firm denies seeing the 
environmental movement as another fad from which it can make a 
buck and independent environmentalists praised merrills handling 
of the issue 
the environmentalists selected those stocks that were 
environmentally responsible said stanley craig national sales 
manager for merrills unit trusts these are not only good 
companies but they are solid financially 
the scheme by the nations largest brokerage is the latest 
attempt since the exxon valdez oil tanker spill last year to 
capitalize on investor demand to make money while showing concern 
about the environment other socially responsible investment 
funds have existed since 1970 
but in the rush to jump on the bandwagon environmentalists have 
criticized several new funds for investing in companies involved in 
waste cleanup that nonetheless have pollution records mother nature 
wouldnt be proud of 
its not just investing in companies that are dealing with 
environmental cleanup its dealing with companies that are 
themselves environmentally responsible said carsten henningsen 
president of progressive securities financial services a portland 
ore investment adviser 
the merrill trust is a fixed portfolio of 29 stocks merrill 
paid the environmental groups 35000 to recommend 100 companies 
they considered environmentally responsible analysts from five 
big firms that will market the trust through their stockbrokers 
then selected the companies with the best financial records 
investors profit if the value of the stock portfolio rises 
merrill and the other brokerages make money from a 4 percent sales 
charge on investments units or shares in the trust will cost 
10 each with a minimum 100unit buy 
merrill said it will donate 50 cents to the washingtonbased 
environmental federation of america for every 100 units sold up to 
the first 25 million invested in the trust more money will be 
donated as the trust grows 
this is the way we want companies to make money out of the 
environment by telling the truth about it said peter camejo 
president of progressive asset management in oakland calif who 
helped set up the merrill trust 
camejo alerted merrill last year that some of the pollution 
control companies in a trust formed after the alaska oil spill were 
polluters themselves merrill later offered to set up the new 
trust the pollution trust sold out in six days last july 
attracting about 125 million in investments 
the new trust consists of 13 companies involved in pollution 
control or abatement 10 natural gas companies two utilities and 
four other companies with no direct environmental tie 
among the stocks are apple computer inc which recycles the 
bulk of its waste walmart stores inc which has a green 
section in its stores for products that use recyclable materials 
or have other environmental benefits and nucor corp which makes 
steel out of scrap from cars and appliances 
theyve got some good companies in there said gordon 
davidson executive director of the coalition for environmentally 
responsible economies in boston 
the only thing of course is that there is no such thing as a 
perfect company he said all these companies need to work to 
improve their environmental performance 
but some environmentalists said that even if the companies in 
merrills trust are proenvironment investment vehicles are no 
substitute for broader changes in corporate policy 
this is wall streets version of green marketing said 
greenpeace usa spokesman peter dykstra almost without exception 
we have found that green marketing is far more marketing than 
green 
what may be a bigger gain is a new marketing tool for merrill 
and a new opportunity to package itself as environmentally 
concerned when the vast majority of its business will still be 
conducted with bluechip stocks in the auto industry or energy 
industry he said 
merrill officials said the firm recycles paper glass and other 
materials and that while the trust prospectus was its first 
printed on recyclable paper it plans to print more that way in the 
future

texas billionaire harold simmons is going to 
court to challenge the legality of the proxy contest he lost last 
month for control of lockheed corps board of directors 
the federal suit filed wednesday on behalf of the 
simmonscontrolled nl industries in houston asked the court to 
declare simmonsbacked nominees the winners or to set a new 
election 
the suit accuses the incumbent board of directors of illegally 
engineering extra proxy votes through an employee stock ownership 
plan and playing a variety of dirty tricks to ensure that simmons 
lost his fight 
this action seeks to restore integrity to the recent election 
of lockheeds board of directors and to ensure integrity in future 
elections said the lawsuit filed in us district court 
bob meder a lockheed spokesman said the company declined to 
comment because officials had not seen the lawsuit 
simmons lost a proxy fight for control of the aerospace 
companys board at the march 29 shareholders meeting but he won 
major concessions for big shareholders 
simmons contends that calabassasbased lockheed the nations 
sixth largest defense contractor has been mismanaged under the 
leadership of chairman daniel tellep 
the dallas investors nl industries owns 189 percent of 
lockheeds common stock he paid about 530 million for his shares 
and is sitting on a paper loss of about 100 million 
simmons was not available for comment on the lawsuit a call to 
his home was not answered and his spokesman did not immediately 
return a phone message 
the lawsuit accuses the company of starting the employee stock 
ownership plan as an llegal entrenchment device whose votes 
should have been disallowed in the election 
if the plans votes and a few sofar challenged proxies were 
thrown out simmons nominees would have won the election the suit 
contends 
the employee stock plan represented a large portion of the 
support for the current board whose 14 incumbents won with support 
ranging from 576 percent to 607 percent the employee plan holds 
nearly 20 percent of lockheeds stock 
simmons has said he was dissatisfied with the way the trustee 
for the employee stock ownership plan had voted a block of shares 
believed to number at least 500000 of the some 12 million shares 
owned by the plan 
hours after the shareholders meeting a spokesman for the stock 
plan said the trustee did not receive voting instructions on the 
large block but still voted those shares for management 
simmons has said that in the absence of voting instructions 
those shares should not have been voted for either side the 
trustee though said it was his fiduciary responsibility to vote 
all of the plans shares 
lockheed said holders of 82 percent of its stock 5268500 
shares of the 63192196 outstanding had cast votes 
the lawsuit also accuses the company of taking a number of 
lastminute steps to allegedly steal the election 
these steps included moving the annual meeting up six weeks from 
its usual date to rob nl industries of time to prepare and 
sending out proxy materials that failed to mention the existence of 
a competing slate of directors the suit alleges 
the suit also complained that managers refused to help nl 
industries approach lockheed workers who would be voting to explain 
simmonss side of the dispute 
separately simmons struck a conciliatory note in an april 16 
letter to tellep that was disclosed in a filing he made wednesday 
with the securities and exchange commission in washington 
i firmly believe that notwithstanding litigation we can work 
together productively to maximize share values for all lockheed 
shareholders and i look forward to doing so the letter said 
simmons suggested in the letter that tellep explore the 
feasibility of a 1 billion stock repurchase plan he also 
suggested the sale of nonstrategic or underperforming assets to 
raise about 1 billion 
lockheed spokesman ron meder declined to comment on the letter 
saying only basically its just a rehash of all the issues 
raised in the proxy contest

with a war looming at its shareholder meeting next 
week norton co won one battle lost another and fired more 
ammunition to fight a takeover bid from britains btr plc 
the flurry of events began wednesday morning when gov michael 
s dukakis signed a law that would prevent btr from wresting 
immediate control over the norton board 
hours later the us court of appeals turned down nortons 
request to delay its april 26 shareholder meeting for two months to 
prepare its defenses 
in the meantime norton filed a lawsuit alleging state law 
prevents btr from exercising any voting power at the shareholder 
meeting btr called nortons claim frivolous 
the sense of urgency was summed up by bernard nussbaum an 
attorney representing norton who told the appeals court these 
people have turned the april 26th meeting into a referendum on the 
future of the company 
norton last month rejected a 16 billion 75ashare offer 
from btr but the british conglomerate threatened to remove 
nortons board of directors through a proxy fight at the 
shareholder meeting 
part of nortons strategy has been to stall btr norton a 
leading maker of abrasives insists it needs extra time to plan its 
options including seeking other investors to help fend off the bid 
theres a whole world out there to explore nussbaum told 
the appeals court adding that if the meeting is held next week 
the reality is the board would lose 
nussbaum argued that under state law a company not only must 
weigh shareholder interests but also its duties to its employees 
customers community and the regional economy 
but stuart meiklejohn representing btr said the companys 
bylaws require norton to hold the meeting april 26 and prohibit 
changing the date 
meiklejohn said there is no evidence to suggest that norton has 
had any success in exploring alternatives instead he argued 
norton is simply trying to line up shareholders who would support 
the companys position 
the appeals court sided with btr upholding a us district 
court ruling from last week the appeals court said it agreed with 
the lower courts interpretation of the norton bylaws stating that 
the annual meeting must be held the fourth thursday of april 
meanwhile in its suit norton said btr had triggered a special 
mechanism in massachusetts law because more than 20 percent of 
stockholders had tendered their shares about 64 percent of the 
shares have been tendered for btr 
the suit contends that under the state law those people who 
tendered their shares would not be able to vote for btr 
btr responded that the suit shows just how desperate the 
norton board is 
we view todays legal maneuvering by norton and its board as 
without merit and a frivolous waste of company assets the 
company said 
btr representatives stressed that the company does not own the 
shares that have been tendered but norton insisted that the 
tendered shares signify beneficial ownership and are subject to 
the law 
norton asked that the issue be decided quickly in state court 
since the issue strictly involves massachusetts law 
nortons stall strategy got a boost early in the day when 
dukakis signed the new law which took effect immediately 
under the law only onethird of the directors could be elected 
at one time meaning btr would have to wait at least a year to gain 
majority control 
btr has vowed to continue with its bid despite the law 
this bill gives companies a welldeserved fighting chance 
against hostile raiders dukakis said in prepared remarks 
he signed the law in worcester where nortons headquarters are 
located declaring we must do all we can to protect our best 
corporate citizens and their workers and families from having their 
livelihoods wiped out 
john nelson the norton chairman told a cheering crowd of 
workers that the company will continue to fight to remain 
independent

eastern airlines unions praised a judges decision to appoint a 
trustee to run the airline saying it vindicated their position in 
the bitter 13month battle against their ultimate foe frank 
lorenzo 
justice has finally been served by stopping the most renowned 
corporate pirate of the past decade said michael j flynn 
president of local 1690 which represents about 2000 striking 
machinists in atlanta 
ever since frank lorenzo took control of eastern in 1986 we 
watched our airline dismantled and sold for the benefit of texas 
air he said 
the union has fought this injustice every step of the way in 
the courts in the congress and with public opinion finally the 
truth has been seen by easterns creditors and shareholders but 
most important by judge lifland 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland late wednesday granted a 
request from easterns unsecured creditors to appoint a trustee to 
run the airline the move took control from lorenzo who is 
chairman of easterns parent texas air 
the decision was particularly sweet for the unions who have 
pushed for a trustee since eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection five days after a crippling strike began in march 1989 
the unions contended that lorenzo was slowly bleeding eastern to 
death by shifting assets to texas air and continental airlines 
easterns largely nonunion sister carrier 
were elated said striking machinist mike richy in miami 
we cant believe it its been a year coming 
in atlanta machinists union leader robert d taylor called the 
judges ruling a sad victory because it took 13 months too long 
nevertheless he said the union will rise to the occasion 
and rebuild this airline under new management 
dick nellis an atlanta representative of easterns pilots 
union sounded a similar note he said he was overjoyed at the 
ruling but added it is really very sad that it has taken so long 
for the system to recognize why the real eastern employees left the 
property in the first place 
literally there have been thousands of careers that have been 
shattered and billions of dollars of eastern airlines assets 
wasted he said it is just a sad thing to think we had to wait 
this long 
a small group of machinists who were gathered at the local 1690 
hall in forest park ga hooted for joy when they learned of 
lorenzos ouster they were more cautious about martin shugrue the 
former continental president who was appointed as trustee 
i will hold my judgment on mr shugrue until we investigate 
him said local 1690 vice president tony chapman there is 
reason to be cautiously optimistic we are looking forward to 
working with him any way possible 
ej breen spokesman for the air line pilot association in 
miami said the appointment of shugrue would give eastern a new 
lease on life 
weve always felt that a change in management was the first 
piece of the formula that would bring eastern back to the 
successful airline that it has been in the past he said now 
that thats been cleared i really think that it means a future for 
eastern airlines it never had a future for the last 4 years that 
frank lorenzo was on the airline

genetically engineered food could become as 
common as corn by the end of this decade say researchers whose 
recent breakthrough in the field already has expanded the range of 
products under development 
tomatoes that taste better and last longer will be among the 
first genetically altered edibles submitted this year for federal 
food and drug administration approval according to the company 
that grows them 
if the fda gives the green light to tomatoes 
herbicideresistant corn likely will be among the cornucopia of 
products that follow because corn has just joined the genetic age 
two teams of researchers say they have produced genetically 
altered corn plants capable of passing on their newly acquired 
traits to the next generation a problem that had stymied 
scientists for years 
the technique promises to produce new strains of disease 
insect and herbicideresistant corn that researchers contend will 
be better for livestock and people and better for the environment 
people have talked for a long time of the potential benefits 
of genetic engineering of corn but until you could put a gene in 
all that was hypothetical said thomas b rice president of the 
seed division of dekalb genetics corp of dekalb ill 
now well find out rice said 
a team of dekalb researchers announced their success with corn 
genetics wednesday two days after a group of agriculture 
department and monsanto co scientists announced similar findings 
at the same conference in keystone colo 
both groups used a gene gun to shoot microscopic genecoated 
bullets into corn cells which were then grown into mature plants 
the adult plants were fertilized with pollen and produced a new 
generation of seedlings which were shown to have the same genetic 
traits that had been engineered into their parents 
genetic engineering of corn the largest and most valuable us 
farm crop has long eluded researchers despite their success with 
soybeans cotton tobacco and tomatoes said michael fromm a 
molecular biologist at an albany calif research center operated 
by the agriculture department and university of california at 
berkeley 
fromm who headed the usdamonsanto research team said the 
technique used successfully with those crops involved a bacteria 
that did not work well with corn and other grains 
researchers using the bacteria technique have developed products 
such as bettertasting longerlasting tomatoes and 
herbicideresistant cottonseed calgene inc a davis calif 
company plans to apply this year for fda approval of the tomato 
said dan wagster calgenes chief financial officer 
with the fdas permission calgene expects to market the 
tomatoes beginning in 1993 wagster said 
but the fda filing is likely to rekindle the debate over genetic 
engineering which critics fear will lead to the careless release 
of new life forms with potentially disastrous consequences 
wagster said that what we expect with the application to the 
fda is that the controversy gets resolved 
the company hopes to document that its new tomato now entering 
its third year of field trials is still a food that is still safe 
as well as an improved product 
he said calgenes genetically altered cottonseed is immune to an 
herbicide that is biodegradable and more concentrated than those 
currently in use but farmers cant use it because it kills cotton 
plants as well as weeds 
if the new cottonseed is approved he said cotton growers could 
switch to that herbicide saving them money and causing less damage 
to the environment

a potential nationwide strike by machinists 
against amtrak was averted early today by an agreement to try to 
settle the dispute a spokeswoman for amtrak said 
the strike had been called for 6 am and pickets who 
apparently did not get word of the agreement appeared in some 
places including south station in boston but sue martin amtrak 
senior director of public affairs in washington said service was 
not affected 
the dispute involved interpretation of an agreement between the 
national passenger railroad and the international association of 
machinists on union officers conducting union business on company 
time 
ms martin said the agreement was being interpreted 
inconsistently and that union leaders in some places essentially 
were spending all day on union business and getting paid by 
amtrak 
amtrak issued guidelines to remedy the problem she said but 
union officials thought they were too narrow under the agreement 
reached early today the guidelines will be put on hold while the 
two sides seek a resolution of their diferences possibly through 
arbitration or court action 
ms martin said she thought lawyers for both sides would meet 
later today in washington to make the agreement formal 
roy wildman a shop steward with machinists local 318 in 
boston said amtrak has made it virtually impossible for union 
officials to conduct any type of union business including 
grievances on amtrak property on company time 
he said union officials could not even use company time for work 
that would benefit amtrak such as arranging vacation times for 
union members 
the machinists inspect maintain and repair the railroad 
equipment and by federal law locomotives on the road must be 
inspected every 24 hours wildman said

perrier water will be back on the 
shelves soon but it wont have the same sparkle at least not on

the food and drug administration has ruled that the mineral

the water comes out of the ground and the carbonation is 
added bob crowell compliance officer in the fdas boston

jane lazgin a spokeswoman for the perrier group of america 
inc in greenwich conn said the company believed its 
description was accurate but would obey the fda 
we certainly want to comply with the fda request even though 
in principle we do disagree with some of the language lazgin

supermarket shelves as soon as possible 
lazgin said bottles would return to the shelf next week

a top bush administration official said today 
that the us trade deficit could worsen this year and warned that 
japans closed markets pose important risks for the world 
economy 
treasury undersecretary david mulford said that there is more at 
stake than reducing americas huge trade imbalance he said growing 
protectionist threats could imperil world prosperity 
if we are going to preserve the global trading system we are 
going to have to insist that japan and others who share the 
benefits do their part mulford said clearly japan has not 
done its part 
mulfords comments were part of the administrations continuing 
campaign to pressure japan to open its markets further for foreign 
trade many have grown concerned that a big decline in the value of 
the yen in recent months threatens to worsen the 49 billion trade 
deficit between the two nations 
a weaker yen would make japanese products less expensive in this 
country while making american goods more costly in japan 
the depreciation of the yen and japans relatively closed 
markets are not sustainable over time as their continuation would 
pose important risks for the world economy mulford said in 
testimony before a senate banking subcommittee 
mulford said that any further improvement in americas broadest 
measure of trade the current account was likely to be very 
modest and the possibility of deterioration in the current account 
cannot be excluded 
mulfords comments echoed the outlook in a new adminisration 
assessemnt prepared by the treasury department which said further 
improvement in the trade balance this year would be modest at 
best 
while this forecast is in line with the view of many private 
economists it poses a threat to the optimistic economic 
assumptions underlying president bushs 1991 budget 
a widening of the trade deficit would worsen the slump in 
manufacturing as companies found it harder to sell their products 
overseas further weakness in manufacturing could seriously depress 
overall economic growth 
the broadest measure of us trade the current account posted 
a deficit of 1059 billion in 1989 it had posted an alltime high 
of 1437 billion in 1987 the current account measures both trade 
in merchandise and services a category that primarily reflects 
investment flows between countries 
so far this year the merchandise portion of the trade deficit 
has been on a roller coaster surging to 932 billion in january 
only to drop to 649 billion in february as oil imports retreated 
from a record high set the month before 
many private economists look for americas oil dependence to 
deepen in coming months as domestic production slumps further 
another negative factor on the trade front is the recent strength 
of the us dollar especially against the japanese yen 
a stronger dollar makes us goods less competitive on overseas 
markets and makes foreign imports cheaper for american consumers 
the united states has often joined with other leading industrial 
countries in coordinated efforts to keep currency rates in line as 
a way at attacking trade imbalances 
the group of seven nations the united states japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy last met in paris 
earlier this month they promised then to continue their 
coordination efforts but rejected petitions by japanese officials 
for stronger action to bolster the sagging yen 
in the trade assessment the administration declared that the 
yens weakness is a matter of concern with undesirable 
consequences for the global adjustment process 
treasury secretary nicholas brady gave a similar view in 
congressional testimony but did not offer any specific actions the 
administration was willing to take 
the us trade deficit with japan widened to 312 billion in 
february from 286 billion in january 
the administrations trade report said the dramatic political 
changes occurring in eastern europe had the potential of easing 
global trade imbalances 
the report said the unification of west and east germany should 
help lower west germanys large trade surpluses because the united 
country would have more demand for imported products however it 
said the prime beneficiaries of this development were likely to be 
other countries in europe not the united states 
on another point the report said taiwan and south korea had 
made progress in liberalizing their currency exchangerate policies 
but that both nations need to make further progress 
the two countries had been cited in previous reports for 
manipulating their currencies in order to bolster their export 
sales particularly with the united states their primary foreign 
market

dayton hudson corp today announced an 
agreement to buy the marshall field amp co department store chain 
for about 104 billion from bat industries plc a british 
conglomerate 
the purchase of the famous chicagobased retailer is expected to 
be completed within two months the deal will link two of the 
midwests most prominent retailers and will expand 
minneapolisbased dayton hudsons presence in chicago and several 
other regional cities 
the definitive agreement with batus inc bats us subsidiary 
must be approved by regulators 
dayton hudson said it planned to keep all 24 marshall fields 
stores in illinois ohio wisconsin and texas open for business 
this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to add another 
premier name to our department store division said kenneth a 
macke dayton hudsons chairman and chief executive officer 
macke said at a news conference in chicago that he anticipates 
no problems in financing the deal and added junk bonds would 
not play a role 
he said it was too early to say what part current fields 
chairman philip miller would play in the chains future but macke 
and stephen watson president of dayton hudson both praised the 
role miller has had in fields over the past five years 
for his part miller who with other managers had mounted a 
buyout offer of their own said he was disappointed his group had 
lost 
we thought we were looking like the front runner said 
miller its always a surprise when you lose 
marshall fields one of the countrys best known department 
store groups was put up for sale last year by bat as part of a 
restructuring to defend itself against a hostile takeover bid by 
sir james goldsmith 
bat a large conglomerate with interests ranging from tobacco to 
financial services and retailing also is selling its saks fifth 
avenue division 
dayton hudsons department store division operates 37 stores 
known as either daytons or hudsons in their respective markets in 
seven midwestern states 
our department store division is among the most profitable in 
its industry and has produced 11 percent compound annual profit 
growth for the past 5 years its consistent performance over the 
last several years supports this acquisition macke said in a 
prepared statement 
we are very excited about the synergy created by these 
powerful department store names marshall fields hudsons and 
daytons each one dominant in its markets he said 
the newly acquired marshall fields will report to marvin w 
goldstein chairman and chief executive officer of the department 
store division dayton hudson is in the process of building two 
replacement and three new department stores by 1992 the addition 
of the fields stores will bring the total number of stores in the 
division to 64 
goldstein said the company expects that there will be 
consolidation of some functions but that those decisions will be 
made in the coming weeks 
the acquisition will be financed with a combination of 
internally generated funds and a mix of debt instruments the 
retailer said dayton hudson does not plan an equity offering 
the corporation recently reported record revenue and earnings 
for the last fiscal year with revenue up 12 percent to 1364 
billion and income up 43 percent to 410 million 
in 1989 dayton hudsons department store divisions revenue was 
18 billion and its operating profit was 179 million the 
division has more than 22000 employees 
dayton hudson also owns the target chain one of the countrys 
biggest discounters with 408 stores in 32 states and mervyns a 
moderatepriced department store company with 221 stores in 15 
states

digital officials said there could be more restructuring but 
they declined to be specific 
the company along with other computer makers has been hurt by 
slow us sales but steinkrauss said digitals us revenues were

our priority in 1990 is to make our business operations 
profitable and to bring down the companys debt level james a 
unruh unisys president and chief executive officer said in a 
statement we made progress in both of these areas in the first 
quarter despite a mixed business environment 
unruh said international business was strong during the quarter 
but our us computer business which has been sluggish for the 
past two years remains weak and we are cautious about the business 
environment in general 
he said he expects benefits from last years restructuring to be 
seen in the second half of this year

nike inc is embroiled in a 
milliondollar dispute with the us customs service over how the 
company makes its air jordan shoes 
customs says the athletic shoe and apparel company must pay a 20 
percent duty when it imports its shoes from asia nike claims it 
owes only 6 percent 
at issue are what is known in the industry as foxinglike 
bands that connect many makes of athletic shoe uppers to their 
soles 
nike says air jordans dont have the bands the government says 
they do and that makes the 120 shoes competitive with domestic 
manufacturers styles with the bands 
in a 10page ruling sent wednesday to us sen bob packwood 
the customs service reaffirmed a preliminary finding last year that 
the imitationleather versions of air jordans have foxinglike 
bands 
nike says the extra duty has been adding 10 to 12 to a pair of 
air jordans retail price since mid1989 when the agency first 
ruled on the matter 
the company has had to pay 8 million to 9 million so far on 
the 32 million pairs that have been imported thus far 
what theyve done is charge all that excess money to the us 
consumer and its not protecting anything said carl davis 
nikes corporate lawyer in washington dc 
air jordans are assembled with a foot frame method that 
attaches soles to uppers differently he said 
the games not over yet he added the only decision we 
have made is that well continue to fight it 
davis said the next step would be an appeal to the us treasury 
department which oversees the customs service or to the us 
court of international trade

grain and soybean futures prices closed 
moderately higher thursday on the chicago board of trade boosted 
by a late flurry of buying linked in part to delays in the south 
american soybean harvest 
rainy weather and sweeping economic reforms have slowed the 
movement of soybeans and soybean meal from brazil the worlds 
secondlargest soybean producer analysts said 
some of thursdays strength in soybean meal futures reflected 
buying of contracts by users looking to lock in purchase prices in 
case the south american shipping delays continue said joel karlin 
an analyst with research department inc a chicagobased brokers 
advisory service 
the crop markets had opened mostly lower amid concerns that the 
soviet unions reprisals against lithuania could jeopardize us 
grain sales to moscow 
but those fears were overshadowed by the soybean rally and by 
ideas the soviet union is seeking to buy more us corn karlin 
said 
at the close wheat futures prices were cent to 3 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in may at 369 a bushel 
corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 277 a bushel

priorities of our nation at a time when we are faced with 
tremendous economic challenges at home and abroad said panetta 
republicans opposed the democratic plan and insisted that no 
serious 1991 budget will be written until congressional leaders and 
the white house hold negotiations 
we look on this as a democratic exercise you need to pass 
through before we go to a summit to bargain over the budget said 
the panels ranking republican rep bill frenzel of minnesota 
thats fine with us 
the plan contains 36 billion in deficit reduction and claims to 
reduce next years budget gap to 635 billion that would satisfy 
the grammrudman laws requirement for a 1991 shortfall of no more 
than 64 billion fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 
it would spread 6 billion in spending increases among 
initiatives ranging from highway construction to antidrug efforts 
and expanded child care 
for its savings the package relies on 115 billion in military 
cuts 139 billion in new taxes the same amount bush is seeking 
and 56 billion in user fees it reduces the expected growth of 
medicare and other benefit programs by 42 billion and claims 
minor savings in several other areas 
its most controversial element is how defense would be treated 
in the first federal budget since the disintegration of the warsaw 
pact 
panettas package would leave next years military budget at 
295 billion in outlays which is about 1 billion less than is 
being spent this year and 115 billion less than what would be 
needed to stay even with inflation the figure also is 8 billion 
below the amount bush is seeking 
more importantly for the long run democrats would also cut next 
years military budget authority to 283 billion some 18 billion 
below this year and 33 billion less than the amount needed to keep 
up with inflation budget authority is the amount of spending 
allowed by an agency over a number of years the reduction is 
crucial because if enacted it would signal the beginning of a 
longrange decline in pentagon spending 
the plan had originally called for 286 billion in defense 
budget authority but liberals on the budget panel threatened not 
to support the package unless the figure was reduced 
over the next five years defense savings would total 251 
billion a shrinkage of military spending of 25 percent from 
current projections democrats would disperse 106 billion to 
domestic programs and apply the remaining 145 billion to shrinking 
the budget gap 
the defense figures were worked out in concert with house 
leaders who now begin the job of selling them to fellow lawmakers 
its a goodsized down payment on greater savings to come 
said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee 
but there is dissatisfaction on both sides of the aisle with the 
defense figures for several reasons 
we look on it as a meltdown not a builddown rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the budget panel said 
of the democrats treatment of the pentagon 
rep ronald dellums dcalif a liberal said the figures 
seemed totally inadequate because they did not cut deeply 
enough a member of the house appropriations defense subcommittee 
rep norman dicks dwash complained that budget authority was 
treated too harshly saying it would be difficult for me to live 
with that low a number 
progress on the budget is going even more slowly in the senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn is uncertain 
whether he has enough votes to approve a spending plan which he 
wants to include a 15 billion defense cut 
the congressional budget document which does not require the 
presidents signature is used as a blueprint for the governments 
fiscal plans actual spending and tax decisions are made in other 
bills later in the year

as the governments promised date for a new 
indictment arrives financier michael milken faces the biggest 
decision in his lengthy securities fraud case to plead or not to 
plead 
attorneys for milken and the government are involved in 
negotiations for a possible settlement in the criminal prosecution 
of drexel burnham lambert incs former highyield bond chief 
sources said thursday 
but it was unclear whether the talks would result in a plea 
bargain tossing aside a 98count fraud and racketeering indictment 
of milken or whether new charges would be levied by friday as the 
government has promised and the case proceed to trial 
individuals close to the case said discussions included a 
possible guilty plea to more than one felony count and penalties in 
the range of 650 million but they cautioned the talks did not 
imply milken was near agreeing to a plea deal 
how much can anybody take its a very stressful annoying 
kind of daytoday living said one attorney with knowledge of 
the case milken has to decide whether his position is improved 
in cutting a deal now or by hanging tough 
assistant us attorney john k carroll told a federal judge 
last month that the government would submit an expanded indictment 
by the end of this week carroll declined to comment thursday as 
did a milken spokesman 
the original indictment of milken his brother lowell and 
former drexel trader bruce newberg amounted to the largest 
financial crime prosecution in us history it was handed up in 
march 1989 
the indictment is based largely on information supplied by 
former stock speculator ivan boesky who recently was released 
after completing two years of a threeyear prison sentence 
it is widely assumed that new charges would include allegations 
stemming from activity that did not involve boesky who was 
implicated in a broad insider trading network and could be an easy 
target for defense lawyers 
by pleading guilty milken and the government would avoid a 
long costly trial milken would avoid a possible jury conviction 
on dozens of criminal counts that would carry years in prison the 
government would avoid the potential embarrassment of losing the 
most highly touted case in its fouryearlong wall street fraud 
crackdown 
but sentencing would rest with us district judge kimba wood 
so it is impossible to negotiate specific prison time through a 
plea bargain 
legal observers said the government is unlikely to agree to a 
onecount plea with a maximum of five years in prison a single 
racketeering count carries a maximum 20year sentence which also 
is considered unlikely boeskys three years is viewed as a base 
i think there is a slow process by which a defendant who 
believes he is innocent is gradually convinced by his attorneys 
that settlement is the best and most realistic course said john 
c coffee jr a securities law professor at columbia university 
milken has pleaded innocent and has said through his attorney 
arthur liman that he intends to fight his case at trial 
in addition to ending his ordeal milken may be willing to 
settle if he can cut a deal exonerating his brother legal experts 
who have followed the case said civil charges also still must be 
resolved 
milken 43 is credited with developing the 200 billion market 
in highrisk securities called junk bonds that were used widely in 
the 1980s to finance corporate growth and hostile takeovers 
the decision by milken a proud man who strongly believes he 
helped american finance on whether to plead guilty is made even 
more difficult because he is convinced of his innocence friends 
say 
he knows in his heart of hearts that he has total integrity 
said dick riordan a los angeles lawyer and friend of milkens 
now to be told that he doesnt is a hard thing to swallow very 
hard 
drexel settled fraud charges with the government and the 
securities and exchange commission last year by agreeing to pay 
650 million in penalties and plead guilty to six felonies the 
drexel fine is seen as a benchmark for a milken plea 
drexel collapsed in february and is liquidating after its parent 
company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection

frank lorenzo whose control of eastern airlines 
has been seized by a federal bankruptcy judge pledged thursday to 
help the courtappointed trustee assuming the helm 
were going to help in all reasonable ways that we can 
lorenzo said in an interview the day after us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland designated a trustee to run financially sagging 
eastern 
after a fourday hearing that ended late wednesday lifland 
granted the request of easterns unsecured creditors to take 
control of the airline from lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
texas air corp 
the creditors who are owed around 980 million were angered by 
easterns relentless losses and managements plans to slash debt 
repayments 
miamibased eastern which had fought the creditors request in 
court said thursday it would not appeal liflands appointment of a 
trustee the airline has been in bankruptcy reorganization since 
march 1989 when a strike by employees shut down its operations 
while pledging to support the new trustee airline executive 
martin shugrue lorenzo acknowledged that the change in leadership 
could prompt some eastern managers to quit 
its very difficult to project the future he said there 
may well be people leavingbut were just going to have to see 
several eastern executives including president phil bakes 
testified in the course of the hearing that appointment of a 
trustee would cause employee departures hurt business further and 
heighten the chance eastern eventually would have to be liquidated 
lorenzo said the end of his stewardship of eastern was a relief 
in some ways since it will allow him to focus full attention on 
continental airlines easterns nonunion sister carrier 
shugrue a former president of houstonbased continental 
resigned under pressure from lorenzo but lorenzo said thursday 
that the decision to let shugrue go was made by continentals board 
of directors 
marty is an able airline operator lorenzo said of shugrue 
and hes going to have our support 
continental will continue to cooperate with eastern in joint 
marketing efforts and frequent flier programs lorenzo said

the cost of a radisson hotel room in knoxville tenn has gone 
up by 5 the soupandsalad bar tab at an indianapolis howard 
johnsons restaurant jumped 29 percent and the peddie school in 
heightstown nj is hiking tuition and room and board 1500 per 
student in the coming academic year 
a slowing overall economy has helped curb some inflation but 
price increases in the service sector spurred by higher wages 
skyrocketing insurance costs and a shortage of workers are 
leaving no american wallet untouched 
were all paying a little more said james f smith a 
finance professor at the university of north carolina 
recent government figures sent mixed signals about inflation 
the price of finished goods slipped 02 percent in march and 
further declines in food and energy prices should keep wholesale 
inflation below last years rate but consumer prices jumped an 
unexpected 05 percent last month the equivalent of an 85 
percent annual inflation rate 
economists agree that the service sector accounts for the 
divergence the cost of services are factored into consumer prices 
but are not a component of the governments producer price index 
it seems that the majority of americans are employed in the 
service sector and thats why inflation seems to be bigger 
problem said marc chandler an analyst at mms international in 
chicago 
some parts of the service sector have dramatically improved 
their efficiency especially banking retailing and other 
businesses that have benefited from the information revolution 
which lowered costs through automation smith said 
but a shortage of workers in several regions of the country and 
the first increase in the minimum wage in nearly a decade are 
pumping wages higher 
while only about 3 million americans earn the minimum wage 
which increased april 1 to 380 an hour from 335 it sets a 
floor for other lowerpaying jobs 
and the cost of higher wages filter through the economy 
were like anybody else said tom polski a spokesman for 
the radisson chain if the cost of doing business goes up it has 
to be passed on to customers 
timothy kennedy said the higher minimum wage has added 90000 
to the 1 millionayear payroll at the radisson hotel he manages 
in knoxville sixty percent of his employees earn the minimum wage 
to compensate kennedy has boosted room rates by 5 a night 
raising the basic singleoccupancy rate to 65 a night and because 
the other service businesses that feed his hotel are also hiking 
their prices because of higher costs the price of a typical menu 
item at the hotels restaurant rose by about 1 
in areas where workers are in short supply employers must pay 
even more to attract them 
at mcdonalds corp which boasts it is not a minimum wage 
employer the average worker earns 480 an hour a spokesman said 
but many employees in the boston area where workers are in demand 
earn as much as 7 an hour 
service sector inflation also is shown by other factors like 
rising insurance premiums which account for sharply higher total 
labor costs 
the fastest growing component of the consumer price index is 
medical care which rose more than 18 percent over the past 12 
months said raymond stone of stone and mccarthy associates a 
consulting firm in princeton nj 
at the peddie school headmaster tom degray said the school is 
raising tuition and room and board from the current 14000 a year 
to 15500 this september to help meet mushrooming insurance costs 
as well as higher teachers salaries 
teachers salaries are moving up at about 8 percent a year 
but insurance costs are going out of sight degray said 
this year the school will pay about 420000 for medical 
insurance for its 150member faculty and staff just four years ago 
the school was paying 240000 a year for greater benefits 
charles galbraith the schools business manager said if 
insurance costs go up only 33 percent this year hell be happy 
the ability to pay competitive salaries and keep costs in line 
for customers require balancing skills that are becoming harder for 
businesspeople to master 
unless we continue to improve salary and benefits were not 
going to be able to keep the finest faculty and attract them 
degray said and its no secret whos going to pay for those 
improvements

the federal government has told perrier 
to remove the phrase naturally sparkling from bottles of the 
imported mineral water and the us distributor said thursday it 
plans to comply 
the food and drug administration said perriers claim to be 
naturally sparkling is false because the water is not naturally 
carbonated as it comes out of the ground at a spring in vergeze 
france 
the water from the spring is mixed with carbon dioxide from a 
gas reservoir beneath it and are combined in the factory after 
impurities in the gas are filtered out 
the water comes out of the ground and the carbonation is 
added bob crowell compliance officer in the fdas boston 
district office said thursday 
perrier which plans to reintroduce its product next week after 
a worldwide recall said it will comply 
jane lazgin a spokeswoman for the perrier group of america inc 
in greenwich conn said the company will obey the fda although 
it believes its product is naturally sparkling 
while we do not agree with the need for these changes and feel 
that our label has always adequately and accurately described our 
product we have made these changes to comply with the fda request 
and to act responsibly in quickly returning perrier to our 
consumers perrier group president ronald v davis said in a 
statement 
lazgin said all perrier bottled after july 29 would bear the new 
label which will say natural mineral water 
a side panel will also state since 1863 bottled only at 
source perrier vergeze france the carbonation used in perrier is 
taken from a naturally occurring source found deep within the 
earth 
source perrier sa of france began a worldwide recall in february 
after trace amounts of benzene were discovered in some bottles 
perrier said the water became contaminated because workers had 
failed to replace filters that remove impurities from the carbon 
dioxide gas it said small amounts of elements such as benzene are 
found in all naturally occurring gases 
perrier said no ones health was ever at risk because of the 
benzene but the incident revealed that perrier which touted its 
product as pure and natural mechanically adds gas to the water and 
filters out impurities 
the company has announced new testing and monitoring procedures 
to prevent future problems 
lazgin said bottles would return to the shelf april 26 
beginning in new york miami and washington all bottles since the 
recall will bear the words nouvelle production 
she said surveys of perrier customers conducted shortly after 
the recall indicated 84 percent would buy it again

eastern airliness striking machinists victorious 
in their quest to outlast company boss frank lorenzo looked ahead 
thursday to negotiating a backtowork pact that could include deep 
concessions 
there obviously is going to be tremendous sacrifices over the 
next year maybe two years or more to bring us back to normalcy 
but its not going to be done in the interest of frank 
lorenzo eastern machinist president charles bryan told about 100 
strikers gathered at union headquarters near miami international 
airport 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp was 
ousted from control of eastern late wednesday in manhattan by us 
bankruptcy judge burton lifland who named former airline executive 
martin shugrue as special trustee of the miamibased carrier 
appointment of a trustee had been a major goal for striking 
workers who contend lorenzo has funneled valuable eastern assets 
to nonunion sister carrier continental airlines 
lifland made the appointment after easterns unsecured 
creditors who are owed 980 million argued that present 
management was unable to bring the company out of its financial 
tailspin 
eastern officials said thursday they will not appeal the 
appointment and lauded liflands indications that the airline can 
be reorganized rather than liquidated 
eastern spokesman bob hunter said the courts decision to 
release 80 million from easterns escrow account will keep the 
carrier in operation through mid1990 
its still business as usual said hunter 
but problems remain eastern lost 8523 million last year and 
creditors say the company has failed to regain the confidence of 
consumers and travel agents since the strike 
several top eastern executives told the bankruptcy court that 
appointment of a trustee could hurt business further and cause 
employee departures 
furthermore the company still must reach longterm contract 
agreements with its unions 
nevertheless shugrue issued a statement projecting optimism 
about easterns future 
i want to reassure the community of travel agents and the 
flying public that eastern is flying that it is flying safely and 
reliably and with an unparalleled level of service and 
enthusiasm he said 
the machinists are seeking talks as soon as possible but 
returning members to the hangars and runways could take some time 
said union leaders 
our main goal now is getting back to work said frank ortis 
president of the machinists miami local but we will remain on 
strike until an agreement is reached weve worked to hard to make 
any moves now that wed regret later 
easterns machinists pilots and flight attendants unions went 
on strike march 4 1989 following lengthy bitter contract 
negotiations the strike forced the company to seek bankruptcy 
court protection from creditors five days later 
of the 9000 machinists who walked off the job about 7500 have 
indicated a desire to return to eastern said ortis about 2500 
workers could be brought back immediately following a strike 
settlement he said 
flight attendants and pilots ended their strikes in november 
but few have returned to eastern because of limited openings the 
company has shrunk its operations since the strike and hired 
replacement workers to fill many positions 
many of the strikers said they would accept some wage and 
benefit cuts in order to get back on the job 
if it was up to me id be back to work today said willie 
washington 47 who has worked as a parttime substitute teacher 
during the strike the goal of this strike was to get rid of 
lorenzo and go back to work well were almost finished 
inside union headquarters many antilorenzo relics remain 
cartoons depicting him as a sinister unionbuster and bumper 
stickers with a red stripe across lorenzos name 
but a bulletin board once covered with newspaper clips o the 
strike was stripped clean a sign on top read after lorenzo 
we are not in a position now to say that everythings over we 
have a long and a very complicated road ahead of us but certainly 
this is a giant step an enormous step to get us to our goal of 
bringing eastern airlines back to preeminence in the airline 
industry bryan said 
bryan declined to make direct comments concerning shugrue but 
said shugrues experience in aviation was encouraging 
shugrue a pilot worked as a pan am corp executive before 
becoming president of houstonbased continental shugrue left 
continental under pressure from lorenzo a month before the eastern 
strike 
shugrue was a consultant to former major league baseball 
commissioner peter ueberroth in a unionsupported effort to acquire 
eastern last year

delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude oil jumped 110 per 42gallon barrel to settle at 1806 
on wednesday the contract traded as low as 1660 a barrel its 
worst level since december 1988 
because the may contract expires friday it typically is more 
volatile other contract months showed smaller gains june crude 
gained 78 cents a barrel while july rose 67 cents

eightmember monitoring panel would meet on may 2 in geneva

analysts estimated the 13nation cartel was pumping more than 24 
million barrels of crude a day well over its ceiling of 221 
million barrels a day for the first half of the year 
analysts say kuwait and the united arab emirates have 
persistently exceeded their opec supply quotas and are believed to 
be producing most of the cartels excess crude 
traders are hoping that opec members will agree to stop 
overproducing so that prices will stabilize 
it always makes the market nervous when theres any sort of 
meeting coming up said john oconnell senior energy analyst at 
refco inc if opec called a meeting they must be concerned

minneapolis retailer dayton hudson corp on 
thursday added a new jewel to its department store crown 
announcing it has reached agreement to buy marshall field amp co for 
about 104 billion 
we view this as a onceinalifetime opportunity dayton 
hudson chairman kenneth macke said in announcing the agreement to 
purchase fields from bat industries plc a british conglomerate 
this is a great strategic fit for us 
at a chicago news conference macke said his company expects to 
complete the deal for fields which operates 24 stores in 
illinois ohio wisconsin and texas within the next two months 
he said dayton hudson had no immediate plans to close any 
fields stores or make dramatic changes in fields strategy and 
reiterated a commitment to the ongoing renovation of fields 
flagship store in chicagos loop 
the acquisition will be financed with a combination of 
internally generated funds and a mix of debt instruments the 
retailer said dayton hudson does not plan an equity offering 
we will have absolutely no problem financing the deal said 
macke who added that junk bonds would play no role in the purchase 
thursdays announcement capped a buyout effort by a number of 
groups including current marshall field chairman and chief 
executive officer philip miller and a fields management team 
miller who is widely credited with helping turn fields around 
in the past five years said he was disappointed by the news but 
was taking a waitandsee attitude before announcing any plans 
we dont have any indication as to what daytonhudsons plans 
are miller said in a telephone interview until we understand 
that were encouraging all our people to keep their powder dry 
miller said he believed until thursday that his group was the 
front runner in the bidding for fields 
its always a surprise when you lose he added 
a bat executive said there was nothing wrong with the fields 
management bid but dayton hudsons was better 
the fact is that the dayton hudson bid was clearly superior in 
financial terms said arthur martinez a senior vice president of 
batus inc bats us subsidiary simply put it was higher in 
other dimensions it was a simpler proposal for us to deal with 
while saying it was too early to discuss management changes 
macke and dayton hudson president stephen watson said they planned 
to meet with miller soon 
phil miller and his team have done an extraordinary job of 
building this company watson said 
others said to be bidding for fields were may department stores

georgia gulf corp shareholders on thursday 
approved a recapitalization of the company a move management 
proposed three months ago to ward off a takeover bid by texas 
investor harold simmons 
the company did not release the vote totals but said if 
financing is completed as expected the recapitalization will take 
effect april 27 
simmons who owns about 10 percent of the chemical makers 
stock said earlier this month he was abandoning his 11 billion 
tender offer for georgia gulf and instead would support the 
proposed recapitalization 
under the approved plan each holder of a share of georgia gulf 
stock will receive 30 in cash one share of a new issue of common 
stock and 850 a share in notes 
stockholders also were given the option of trading their common 
stock at the rate of one share for 55 shares of new common stock 
the original recapitalization plan called for 38 in cash but 
there was doubt expressed that the company could sell the necessary 
junk bonds to finance that offer 
analysts previously have had mixed reactions to the move noting 
that it would put the company heavily in debt simmons through his 
company nl industries is expected to realize about 15 million in 
profits from the recapitalization 
meanwhile thursday georgia gulf announced its first quarter 
earnings declined 33 percent from the same period in 1989 
net income for the quarter was 374 million or 152 a share 
down from 554 million or 212 a share during the same three 
months last year net sales also fell to 2516 million from 3178 
million 
jerry r satrum georgia gulfs president and chief operating 
officer said the decline was substantial and said it was 
partly a result of having to compare earnings to record levels 
achieved a year ago 
during 1989 and in particular the first two quarters of that 
year business conditions were robust and pricing reflected spot 
shortages for most products we manufacture satrum said 
despite the fact that we were unable to maintain this 
momentum we are pleased with the companys progress so far this 
year given the obvious slowdown in the general economy he said

the securities and exchange commission made it 
easier thursday for big institutional investors to trade privately 
in unregistered stocks and bonds a move expected to help lower the 
cost of raising money for us companies 
the new rule helps cut costs partly by easing disclosure 
requirements for companies making socalled private placements 
it also is seen as making the market for such securities more 
liquid by clearly defining who may buy and sell them that 
eliminates an uncertainty that made them unattractive to large 
investors and forced many issuers to sell the securities at a 
discount 
the rule change also is an attempt to woo foreign corporations 
previously put off by onerous us disclosure requirements to 
raise capital here 
the sec requires companies offering stock to the public to 
register and make extensive disclosures about ownership financing 
and other issues to protect investors 
but the sec eased restrictions on trading of privately offered 
securities which arent required to register and arent bound by 
us disclosure regulations 
only large institutional investors like banks pension funds and 
insurance companies that already hold 100 million in securities 
can qualify for the new private placement restrictions with 
certain exceptions 
the sec which has one vacancy approved the measure 40 
the rule rule 144a set a high threshold for participating in 
the private placement market to screen out unsophisticated 
investors who are more in need of such disclosures provided by sec 
regulation of public offerings 
the sec also approved rule changes that would make the national 
association of securities dealers portal trading system the market 
place for such unregistered securities and would clarify 
regulations governing foreign transactions of unregistered 
securities 
these rules will have a profound and beneficial effect upon 
the ability of issuers to raise capital in the context of todays 
global marketplace and will enhance the competitiveness and 
efficiency of our domestic markets said sec chairman richard c 
breeden who has been pushing to make the us securities laws and 
markets more competitive with foreign markets 
the result should be a lower cost of capital in our markets 
breeden said at the beginning of the threehour meeting before a 
standing room only crowd of more than 200 
linda c quinn head of the secs corporation finance division 
said the rule change would make it easier to sell privately placed 
unregistered securities 
it says that if you have a security that hasnt been 
registered and you want to resell it without any conditions you 
can do it as long as you resell it to the right person and thats 
the 100 million institutional investor requirement she said 
currently the law is unclear as to when you can resell it 
exceptions to the 100 million requirement are banks and savings 
and loans which must have net worth of 25 million in addition to 
the 100 million securities holding and registered brokerdealers 
that either own and manage 10 million in securities or act as 
riskless principles for qualified institutional buyers 
the rule changes will not affect small investors unless they 
have money in a big pension fund or mutual fund that invests in 
privatelyoffered securities 
breeden said that according to some reports the market for 
privately placed securities has grown from 158 billion in 1980 to 
1704 billion last year 
we hope this rule will have a beneficial effect even on people 
who dont buy securities at all breeden told reporters after the 
meeting to the extent that we can reduce the cost of us 
companies raising capital thatll benefit the people who work for 
those companies benefit the us economy broadly by helping make 
us more competitive

oil futures prices rebounded strongly thursday on the new york 
mercantile exchange on news that opec had called an emergency 
meeting to discuss the recent plunge in oil prices 
on other commodity markets thursday grain and soybean futures 
rose livestock and meat were mostly higher and precious metals 
were mixed 
some energy analysts regarded the opec announcement as a ploy to 
keep prices from falling further in hopes that a seasonal rise in 
gasoline demand will sop up the crude oil surplus eliminating the 
need for a cut in opec production quotas 
basically this is a little bit of a stability conspiracy 
said peter beutel the head of energy trading for elders futures 
inc 
nonetheless west texas intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents 
to 110 higher with the contract for delivery in may up 110 at 
1806 a barrel heating oil was 11 cent to 145 cents higher with 
may at 5280 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 135 cent to 
223 cents higher with may at 6178 cents a gallon 
all 13 members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries will attend a may 2 special meeting of opecs 
pricemonitoring committee the cartels acting president sadek 
boussena said thursday 
he said the meeting was called to discuss the recent drop in 
crude oil prices to 16month lows a decline that market analysts 
have blamed on opec overproduction during a period of weak seasonal 
demand 
the opec members probably could firm up the oil market quickly 
by cutting their own production quotas but some analysts said the 
cartel is unlikely to do so they said opec is more likely to hold 
out the possibility of quota cuts while it waits for the seasonal 
increase in gasoline production to eliminate the crude oil surplus 
that increase has already begun analysts said citing tuesdays 
american petroleum institute inventory survey which showed only a 
slight rise in us crude oil stocks and a dramatic increase in 
us refinery activity 
the 33 percent rise in refinery runs indicated most refiners 
have completed their springtime turnarounds when they shut 
down to retool for more gasoline and less heating oil production 
by june 25 the rescheduled date of opecs midyear conference 
the current crude oil glut may have been reduced to the point where 
opec no longer needs to consider cutting quotas beutel said 
in the meantime he said opec members may continue to hint at 
quota cuts just to keep prices from falling 
tom bentz director of trading for united energy inc agreed 
its basically a ploy to stabilize the market a little longer 
until they can make it to june 
grain and soybean futures rose moderately on the chicago board 
of trade boosted by a late flurry of buying linked in part to 
delays in the south american soybean harvest 
rainy weather and sweeping economic reforms have slowed the 
movement of soybeans and soybean meal from brazil the worlds 
secondlargest soybean producer analysts said 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents higher with may at 
369 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 
277 a bushel oats were cent to cent higher with may at 
157 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with may 
at 600 a bushel 
cattle futures ended mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange 
while pork futures rose sharply paced by limit gains in the pork 
belly market amid stronger cash markets and bullish chart signals 
live cattle were unchanged to 15 cent higher with april at 
7992 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent lower to 30 cent 
higher with april at 8405 cents a pound live hogs were 05 cent 
to 75 cent higher with april at 5747 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 85 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with may at 6142 
cents a pound 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures ended 1 to 120 
higher with april at 37730 a troy ounce silver was unchanged to 
03 cent lower with may at 5078 a troy ounce

from the 1987 stock market crash business in key areas such as 
stock and bond underwriting investment banking and retail

million or 116 a share in the same yearago period

the dollar was mixed thursday in domestic 
foreign exchange trading losing ground against a revived japanese 
yen but rising against most other major currencies 
gold prices moved higher 
analysts said rumors in the markets that the japanese were about 
to push their interest rates higher placing the yen in a better 
position to compete with the dollar put pressure on the us 
currency 
jack barbanel president of first global asset management inc 
said the dollar has not performed as well as might have been 
expected in recent days given an improvement in the us trade 
deficit and an increase in market interest rates in the united 
states this week 
barbanel said exchange rates may be stabilizing or foreign 
currencies may be enjoying a technical bounce after the dollars 
recent rise 
overseas dealers said the yens modest recovery after weeks of 
declines was a result of a range of events notably a rebound on 
the tokyo stock exchange and reported comments from us treasury 
officials that they viewed the dollar as too strong 
the dollar closed in tokyo at 15775 yen down 212 yen from the 
wednesday close later in london the dollar traded lower at 15640

outside the windows of the federal bankruptcy 
courthouse the fading sun reddened the sky over new york harbor 
inside the sun was setting on frank lorenzos reign over 
eastern airlines 
david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner for eastern had 
remained uncharacteristically quiet through most of the fourday 
hearing over a request by creditors to put an outside trustee in 
charge of the airline now at around 720 pm wednesday all the 
witnesses had been heard and shapiro let loose 
the issue in this case is 12 billion in losses within a 
year thundered shapiro a bear of a man known as a tough 
mediator can mr lorenzo now be allowed to wipe out the 
creditors interest can anyone blame the creditors for being 
outraged 
the 100 or so people packed into the small courtroom of us 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland hung on every word attorneys 
for easterns unions which shut down the airline in march 1989 
had been dreaming of such a moment for more than a year 
from the outset the unions had demanded that a special trustee 
be appointed to take control of eastern from lorenzo chairman of 
easterns parent texas air corp but they had gained a powerful new 
ally in recent weeks the committee of easterns unsecured 
creditors exasperated by the airlines staggering losses and plans 
to slash debt payments had asked lifland to appoint a trustee 
attorneys for eastern and texas air their table littered with 
documents pens and bottles of mineral water had called a stream 
of witnesses to fight the creditors motion 
after shapiro lawyers for the creditors and for eastern would 
be speaking then it would be liflands turn 
the staten island ferry plied across the harbor as the red sky 
turned to indigo and lights flickered it was 745 
shapiro homed in more closely on the man at the center of the 
courtroom drama the man who insists he is an airline builder while 
labor calls him a unionbuster 
mr lorenzo only starts negotiating at the very last minute 
the washington attorney said hes just a tough guy to make a 
deal with 
lorenzo didnt hear shapiros closing statement he had left the 
courthouse earlier after testifying as the final witness of the 
hearing 
indeed lorenzo seemed to be doing some negotiating from the 
witness box in his last few hours as easterns chief he offered a 
new reorganization proposal that would give the unsecured creditors 
about 30 cents for every dollar owed up from a previous offer of 
about 27 cents that creditors had rejected 
lorenzo the son of spanish immigrants and the head of an 
airline empire raised his right hand and was sworn in by the court 
reporter just before 6 pm he was questioned first by robert sisk 
an attorney for texas air who asked him about his history his 
relationship with eastern president phil bakes and the links 
between eastern and its parent 
lorenzo wearing a conservative navy suit blue shirt and 
reddish tie looked tired as he answered sisks questions about 15 
minutes into his testimony he carefully poured a glass of water 
from the aluminum pitcher in the witness box ten minutes later he 
arched his back and leaned his head back almost horizontally in his 
chair later he stretched out his right arm and drummed his 
fingers on the wood of the box a few times 
at around 640 he put his hands together in a prayerlike 
position tucked under his chin 
were pretty proud of our track record he told the court 
noting how he had successfully taken easterns sister continental 
airlines out of chapter 11 bankruptcy 
after a brief crossexamination by creditors attorney joel 
zweibel and some pointed questions from lifland lorenzo stepped 
down 
after four days of agonizingly slow hearings time started 
telescoping like the last bit of sand running through an 
hourglass after a recess it was time for shapiros statement 
followed by summations by zweibel and bruce zirinsky the lead 
attorney for eastern 
the union lawyers remained silent 
interrupting the speakers from time to time lifland started 
giving increasingly strong indications that he might take the 
radical step of appointing a trustee he referred to lorenzos 
wheel of power and the strong relationship between texas air 
and eastern lashing out at zirinskys attempts to demarcate the 
two 
as the harbor sky turned from indigo to jetblack lifland 
declared one last recess for an hour when court reconvened he 
said he would render his opinion 
as they ran out of the courthouse for a quick dinner some 
skeptical union lawyers still werent convinced that lifland would 
opt for a trustee they were afraid that lorenzo the consummate 
dealmaker might still pull a lastminute agreement with the 
creditors out of his hat 
its this hour that makes me nervous confided bruce simon 
an attorney for the air line pilots association 
the courtroom filled up again at around 915 as people waited 
for lifland to emerge from his chambers with a written opinion in 
his hand 
at around 10 lifland appeared the air conditioning must be 
off he noted as he sat down at the bench the chief judge of the 
us bankuptcy court for the southern district of new york started 
reading citing a litany of legal cases 
the flying publics interest must at all times be taken into 
account he said its time to change the captain of easterns 
crew 
frank lorenzo had been thrown out of the cockpit

manufacturers on thursday recalled more than 
600000 infant pillows and cushions linked to the suffocation 
deaths of 19 children the government said parents should stop 
using any similar pillows 
one firm whose pillows were involved with more than several 
deaths was resisting the recall and could face legal action said 
an official with the consumer product safety commission 
but a spokesman for the company comfort products of dallas 
said that the firms president would meet with cpsc officials 
friday and that an agreement was expected 
today we are announcing that nine of the 10 firms that made 
these cushions have agreed to recall their products from the 
public said jacqueline jonessmith chairwoman of the consumer 
product safety commission 
regardless of who made the product we urge consumers to 
please please please stop using it immediately added david 
schmeltzer head of the cpscs compliance division he said the 
recall could eventually include nearly a million pillows 
nineteen children 3 months or younger have been found dead 
lying stomachdown on the cushions since september 1987 said 
jonessmith three of the deaths occurred in january and february 
of this year ten deaths occurred last year 
using a doll schmeltzer demonstrated how the soft pliable 
pillows conform to shape and could engulf a child placed faced down 
on them because infants often are unable to roll over by 
themselves they can suffocate when placed in that position on the 
cushions 
sen alfonse damato rny who has been critical of the 
commission said this action should have taken place months 
ago 
damato last month criticized the cpsc for having an entirely 
too casual attitude about taking legal action against the pillow 
manufacturers 
the commission issued a warning march 6 urging parents to 
discontinue use of the pillows but it did not move to ban the 
pillows because such actions can take longer than a voluntary 
recall said spokesman dan rumelt 
the commission said negotiations had included all makers of an 
estimated 950000 pillows produced since 1985 
the recall involves 627825 small pillows or cushions filled 
with plastic foam beads marketed by six manufacturers who the 
commission said would begin their recalls on thursday 
three additional producers have agreed in principle with the 
recall and details on their response would be made available in the 
next few days the cpsc said 
as for the company that has resisted the recall schmeltzer 
said if agreement by that company is not reached shortly the 
staff will recommend to the commission appropriate legal action to 
try and rectify the situation 
we believe there have been more than several deaths that have 
been involved with that companys product he added 
schmeltzer said the firm has not notified its distributors but 
has stopped manufacturing its product 
the cpsc said it was prohibited from identifying the company 
however private consumer advocate david snow who met this week 
with cpsc officials said it was comfort products of dallas 
patty lifsey lakstigala of san diego whose 2monthold son 
kailan was found lying face down on a comfort tote cushion on 
feb 24 also said she had learned the company would not be 
participating in the recall 
the spokesman for comfort products jan hamill said from dallas 
that the firm president margaret alivizatos was in washington to 
meet with commission officials to discuss a plan to meet the 
commissions concerns about the comfort tote 
the company in a statement attributed to alivizatos said we 
anticipate that our company and the commission will reach agreement 
on this plan promptly and tat it will be implemented as quickly as 
possible 
eight of the 19 reported deaths occurred in texas of the other 
deaths there were two each in florida oklahoma and one each in 
arkansas california hawaii illinois missouri north carolina 
and virginia 
two retailers jc penney co inc and the army and air force 
exchange service which sold one brand of the cushions worldwide at 
post and base exchanges have joined the recall effort however 
the commission said none of the reported deaths involved cushions 
sold by those retailers 
the recall includes 
467000 mothers helper cushions made by hollander home 
fashions in newark nj hollander said last month it had recalled 
its cushions in january 
110000 gold bug support sacks made by gold inc of denver 
35700 cozy cushions made by pinky baby products of houston 
12000 cozy baby pillows manufactured by cozy baby products 
of mount vernon ny 
3000 baby minder cushions made by the fourth little pig of 
san anselmo calif

crude oil futures rose sharply thursday 
after opec ministers agreed to hold an emergency meeting on may 2 
to try to brake the recent price slide that pushed crude to its 
lowest levels in 16 months 
prices rallied immediately after word spread that the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries had decided to call a 
special session of its eightmember monitoring panel 
sadek boussena of algeria the cartels acting president said 
an urgent meeting was necessary given the persistence of the 
deterioration registered on the international oil market 
this meeting will examine the measures needed to halt the 
constant degradation of the market and to raise prices so as to 
reestablish them at the level set by opec boussena said in a 
statement released by algerian officials in london 
the may contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark us 
crude jumped 110 per 42gallon barrel to settle at 1806 on the 
new york mercantile exchnage other contracts also gained 
the market has decided to take it very bullishly nick 
antill analyst at the londonbased investment firm of county 
natwest said of opecs announcement 
the crude had been trading in the range of 20 to 21 a barrel 
early in april it plummeted nearly 90 cents in the two previous 
sessions finishing at its lowest since december 1988 
prices have been pummeled on reports that opec was exceeding its 
own output limits at a time of seasonal declines in demand by oil 
consuming nations 
the average price of seven crudes used as the cartels reference 
plummeted to 1538 a barrel last week compared with 1712 a 
barrel in the first week of april and well below opecs target 
price of 18 a barrel 
boussena who is algerias mines minister said all 13 opec 
members would attend the special session although it technically 
was a meeting of the cartels eightmember price monitoring 
committee 
opecs midyear conference previously scheduled for may 25 has 
been postponed until june 25 to give time for the market to move to 
a better balance between supply and demand he said 
analysts estimated the cartel was pumping more than 24 million 
barrels of crude a day well over its ceiling of 221 million 
barrels a day for the first half of the year 
kuwait and the united arab emirates which persistently have 
cheated on their opec supply quotas have been blamed for producing 
most of the cartels excess crude 
on tuesday the oil ministers of saudi arabia kuwait and the 
united arab emirates met in saudi arabia and called on all members 
to abide by their production quotas 
but the markets reacted skeptically to the ministers statement 
and prices continued sliding 
antill said that if the emergency session had not been 
scheduled things looked bleak but now he said theres 
potential for some sort of upside movement of prices earlier than 
expected 
lucy mullins analyst at londons barclays de zoete wedd said 
the ministers decision to call the meeting indicated they are 
very severely concerned about the fall in prices 
she said it indicated that they intend to take positive moves 
to shore up oil prices 
analysts had been predicting prices would weaken in the 
apriljune period when warmer temperatures reduce oil demand in the 
united states and other consuming nations but they were surprised 
by the sudden plunge that began last week 
prices were expected to strengthen in june when demand for 
gasoline picks up at the start of the summer driving season

fastfood giant mcdonalds corp on thursday 
reported a 12 percent increase in its firstquarter profit and 
announced plans to switch from ice cream drinks and desserts to 
lowfat dairy foods and fruit sorbet 
the company recently was criticized publicly by a nebraska 
millionaire who placed national newspaper ads saying mcdonalds 
foods are too fatty 
mcdonalds reported net income of 1581 million or 43 cents 
per share for the three months ending march 31 compared with 
1417 million or 38 cents per share for the same period a year 
ago 
first quarter revenue rose 11 percent to 15 billion from 14 
billion mcdonalds said in a statement from its headquarters in 
the chicago suburb of oak brook 
systemwide sales including sales at franchised outlets as well 
as companyowned stores climbed 9 percent to 43 billion from 
39 billion 
chairman michael quinlan said in a statement the companys 
business remained strong despite intense competition and a slower 
us economy 
responding personally for the first time to the recent attack on 
the fat content of mcdonalds foods quinlan said mcdonalds offers 
highquality and wholesome food which fits comfortably into a 
wellbalanced diet 
he said mcdonalds would make the switch to lowfat milk shakes 
lowfat frozen yogurt and orange sorbet ice by may 15 the chain 
already has added nofat nocholesterol apple bran muffins and 
cereals to its breakfast menu quinlan said 
the lowfat milk shakes contain significantly less fat than 
the current milk shakes but retain the same great taste quinlan 
said 
earlier this month nebraska millionaire phil sokolof bought 
fullpage ads in major us newspapers saying mcdonalds foods are 
too fatty he called on the restaurant chain to cut the fat content 
of its hamburger meat by 10 percent 
mcdonalds first responded that it was experimenting with using 
vegetable shortening instead of lard for frying its french fries 
and hash browns 
the company then went on the attack itself by sending letters to 
newspapers advising them that sokolofs ad was inaccurate and 
warning them not to print it again 
mcdonalds spokesman chuck ebeling said thursday mcdonalds had 
been planning the switch to lowfat dairy products since last fall 
he said the company chose to announce the change at this time to 
combat public perceptions that may have been created by sokolofs 
campaign 
ebeling said mcdonalds wanted to demonstrate the fact that 
first of all sokolof is all wet in implying theres too much fat 
in mcdonalds menu and in inferring we havent been doing 
everything possible to enhance our menu in every way thats 
feasible with respect to nutrition and good health 
our menu is balanced and nutritious as it stands ebeling 
said these things are just an enhancement to it 
mcdonalds also has taken steps recently to combat perceptions 
that its heavy use of plastic and polystyrene foam contributes 
greatly to pollution 
mcdonalds began a pilot program last year in 250 new england 
restaurants that promote recycling of polystyrene food containers 
and other plastics 
earlier this week mcdonalds announced plans to spend 25 
percent of its 400 millionayear construction budget on recycled 
materials the company also plans to use recycled paper for 
carryout bags at 500 of its outlets

the quarter ending march 31 compared to 114 million ot 116 a 
share a year ago revenue held steady at 13 billion

a small group of mostly immigrant workers who 
speak 87 languages among them are responsible for federal 
legislation allowing labor unions to negotiate for 
affordablehousing assistance 
the success by hotel and restaurant employees local 26 stemmed 
from the strength of its 5000 members hotel and food service 
workers who struggled to eke out a living in one of the countrys 
most expensive cities local president domenic bozzotto said 
thursday 
it shows that when people get together over social 
responsibility you can build community said bozzotto this is 
what america is all about weve shown all the cynics that 
americas not dead were still in love with america our parents 
told us anything could be done here and were not jaded yet 
union officials from new jersey to california called the local 
26 offices thursday to ask about the legislation president bush 
signed into law wednesday it was the first significant change in 
the tafthartley act in 20 years and the first time a local union 
as opposed to an international union had effected a change 
bozzotto said 
tafthartley has been the nations overriding labor relations 
law for 43 years it includes anticorruption provisions 
prohibiting management from making direct payments to unions except 
for certain purposes such as employee education health care and 
retirement the amendment adds housing to that list 
it became necessary after local 26 negotiated in 1988 an 
unprecedented agreement with nine boston hotels requiring employers 
to place money in a housing trust fund that could be used to 
finance housing purchases and rentals 
its going to have a huge impact its the new benefit of the 
90s said bruce marks housing director for local 26 as he 
fielded calls for information from unions and employers 
the cost of the housing trust fund for employers for local 26s 
members is 15 million during the threeyear contract in 
contrast dental insurance in the contract will cost 2 million 
officials from the teamsters union united auto workers the 
firefighters union in toledo ohio the united food and commercial 
workers in michigan and the policemen and city workers unions in 
new york city were among callers 
new york city unions were particularly interested because most 
city workers are required to live in one of the five boroughs 
known for their expensive housing the housing assistance plan may 
someday be brought to the bargaining table said michael musuraca 
of district 37 of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees 
some employers are amenable 
peter van kleeck president of saunders hotels co in boston 
said he was first surprised at the demand but later became 
much more convinced 
we agreed to it voluntarily carl madda director of labor 
relations for the sheraton corp said in a brief statement we 
were satisfied by the negotiation we hope it works out 
the legislative success is a story that began according to 
union officials with universal predictions of failure 
they said youre nuts but we take our philosophy from the 
reverend jesse jackson never surrender said bozzotto a union 
official since 1981 
bozzotto 50 said he is typical of union members he said pushed 
for the legislation 
the son of an italian immigrant who worked as a cook in a boston 
hotel bozzotto began work at age 13 as a hotel dishwasher he 
later moved up to busboy and waiter he worked in hotels to pay his 
way through college 
its brutal work said bozzotto people only see the front 
part of a hotel if youre in the back in the bowels of the 
kitchen or the laundry room working in all that heat or steam its 
hard hard work 
he said most members of local 26 work two or three jobs to meet 
living costs the average price of a singlefamily house in the 
boston area is 190000 and an average twobedroom apartment runs 
about 800 a month

harold simmons lawsuit challenging the 
legality of the proxy war he lost for control of lockheed corp is 
pure harassment and without merit lockheed chairman daniel 
tellep said thursday 
the company also reported that first quarter profits rose 11 
percent because of lower tax payments 
simmons federal suit filed wednesday asks either for a new 
election or that his nominees for lockheeds board be declared the 
winners it alleges lockheed illegally engineered extra proxy votes 
through an employee stock ownership plan and played a variety of 
dirty tricks to defeat simmons 
the results of the election were clear and decisive tellep 
replied in a statement from lockheeds headquarters in suburban 
calabasas 
we are extremely disappointed that simmons has chosen to 
ignore the independently certified results despite losing the 
election by over a 20 percent margin 
tellep suggested again that simmons was interested more in his 
own investment than the good of the company 
we view this action by simmons as nothing more than pure 
harassment tellep said simmons action confirms our view that 
he is interested only in advancing his own agenda at the expense of 
other lockheed shareholders 
lockheed and simmons also revealed thursday they each spent 
about twice as much as they originally estimated in fighting their 
fiveweek battle which culminated at the aerospace companys 
annual meeting march 29 the incumbent board was retained by about 
a 32 margin 
lockheed spokesman stephen chaudet said the company spent 15 
million to persuade shareholders to reelect the board of 
directors it originally estimated spending would total 8 million 
simmons the texas billionaire who owns about 19 percent of 
lockheeds stock spent more than 10 million compared with an 
initial 6 million estimate said his chief strategist j landis 
martin 
martin said simmons bought about a dozen ads in national 
newspapers and in smaller papers in areas where lockheed does 
business that was twice the number he had anticipated he said 
simmons also spent far more than expected on mailings to 
lockheed shareholders particularly participants in the employee 
stock ownership plan martin said 
chaudet also attributed lockheeds extra expenses mainly to the 
costs of newspaper advertisements and shareholder mailings 
separately lockheed said profits rose to 69 million or 109 
a share in the first three months of the year from 62 million or 
104 a share a year earlier sales rose 8 percent to 225 
billion from 209 billion an increase spread fairly evenly across 
the corporation tellep said 
program profits were unchanged at 114 million but lockheed 
spent 13 million less on income taxes than in the 1989 period 
helping to boost net profits 
martin simmons chief lieutenant and the head of nl 
industries through which simmons bought his stake in lockheed 
declined to comment on the results 
simmons contends that lockheed the nations sixth largest 
defense contractor has been mismanaged under telleps leadership 
his lawsuit contends the employee stock ownership plan which 
also owns about 19 percent of lockheeds stock is an illegal 
entrenchment device set up by the board to put a large block of 
stock in friendly hands
