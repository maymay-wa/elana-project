the big arm of the crane smashed into the 
stacked slabs of concrete like a fist through a window scattering 
enough bits of berlin wall to fill a dozen souvenir stands 
a small crowd lingered close to midnight sunday to watch the 
floodlit scene wincing as a screeching scraping array of machines 
began clearing away the most famous section of the battered barrier 
from this spot the gigantic brandenburg gate serving as a 
breathtaking backdrop came the most vivid image of the collapse 
of communist east germany 
thousands climbed the section of wall when the countrys borders 
were opened on nov 9 chipping away at the stretch of stone that 
that was once an art gallery of political graffiti 
i remember walking with my old mother here on nov 5 and 
telling her that it wont be long before this wall is gone said 
west berliner hans ulrich 42 as he leaned on a guardrail and 
watched the destruction 
of course id been saying that for years 
when they built the wall around west berlin nearly three decades 
ago communist authorities put the most effort into the 575foot 
section that loops around the brandenburg gate it was by far the 
most heavily reinforced a semicircle of concrete slabs cemented 
together and woven with heavy cable 
with the 18thcentury brandenburg gate the symbol of old berlin 
this section of wall was the symbol of its division splitting the 
wide avenue that was once a main thoroughfare 
after the wall was opened a border crossing was cut into it at 
brandenburg gate and the area became a major tourist attraction 
makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything from berlin wall 
keychains to membership pins worn by east germanys notorious 
former secret police 
much of the imaginative graffiti has been chiseled away by 
souvenir hunters who place great value on paintsplashed pieces of 
wall new postrevolution graffiti has taken its place 
the wall is on its way to your hometown read one comment 
the new east german government has said it will remove all of 
the 100mile barrier that encircles west berlin a few weeks ago 
long sections adjacent the brandenburg gate were demolished 
late saturday night after most of the tourists had gone home a 
west german construction crew and east german soldiers began taking 
down the section of wall directly in front of the gate 
they planned to work only at night completing the removal 
within a week officials say they hope to restore auto traffic down 
the divided street 
about 400 people watched sunday night as a giant jackhammer 
hooked to the end of a crane continued the slow battle against the 
walls most formidable stretch 
it is a symbol but it kept people apart said east berliner 
fabian evers 18 as he sold chunks of wall on a blanket near the 
gate it is an ideological statement to tear it down 
ulricht a school teacher said he has no desire to see this 
part of the wall remain as a memorial 
this section was a symbol not only of the division of berlin 
and germany but of east and west europe he said i enjoy very 
much that this wall is coming down

before richard m daley was elected mayor last 
year his opponent predicted he would bring the machine politics of 
his famous father back to the city 
daley denied it then and he denies it now saying his 
administration has been fair to everybody his critics dont 
think so especially when it comes to race and hiring for city 
jobs and theyre determined to beat him next year 
daley elected only a year ago to fill the last two years of 
harold washingtons second term after he died faces reelection in 
april 1991 his overall popularity is high but some of his 
detractors say his black opponent in the general election tim 
evans was prescient 
city figures show more blacks than whites have been hired by the 
government during daleys tenure but there are more than 100 more 
whites and nearly 80 fewer blacks than before in top positions 
city officials said 
daley is still playing the game of firing blacks and hiring 
whites and putting his machine in place said robert starks a 
northeastern illinois university professor 
starks also is chairman of the task force for black political 
empowerment which worked to elect washington as the citys first 
black mayor in 1983 
the blacks that daley is hiring generally are loyal to the 
mayor not black neighborhoods starks said 
its an old technique that his father perfected he said 
referring to the late richard j daley who ran the city for 21 
years until his death in 1976 
court rulings have severely limited the kind of patronage the 
elder daley practiced and his son says there is no machine 
the writers keep writing about it daley said in a recent 
interview i dont see why 
and when asked about the lower numbers of blacks in top 
positions daley said we have black we have asian we have 
hispanic we have women in positions sure were fair to 
everybody 
in the primary daley defeated eugene sawyer a black former 
alderman elevated to mayor temporarily by a sharply divided city 
council following washingtons heartattack death in november 1987 
in the general election daley defeated thirdparty candidate 
evans a city alderman 
in sawyers last days as mayor blacks and whites each held 
about 42 percent of roughly 800 policymaking jobs not covered by 
antipatronage court decrees according to daley administration 
figures 
after less than five months of daleys tenure the numbers 
shifted so that 57 percent of the top jobs were held by whites and 
31 percent were held by blacks officials said in the fall now of 
839 top positions 54 percent are held by whites and 31 percent are 
held by blacks city personnel director glenn carr said 
overall he said the daley administration has hired 2168 
people including 37 percent white 40 percent black 13 percent 
hispanic 2 percent asian the rest did not indicate their race on 
employment forms that compares with a city population that is 37 
percent white 41 percent black 17 percent hispanic and 4 percent 
asian 
evans who has not indicated whether he will challenge daley 
again said he thinks the mayor is vulnerable 
i dont think that fairness has been a cornerstone of this 
administration evans said the facts show that a 
disproportionately large number of people terminated have been of 
africanamerican descent

college scholarship shows he was a nazi supporter while a student 
in vienna the us justice department and world jewish congress 
said saturday 
a spokesman for the austrian president and former united nations 
secretarygeneral denied the allegation 
the may 18 1938 letter describes waldheim as having been a 
convinced nazi for years the congress said in a statement the 
letter to the austrian chamber of commerce was written on 
waldheims behalf by the head of viennas consular academy a 
diplomatic college where he was studying 
the academy director also wrote that waldheim had submitted 
proof that he had four aryan grandparents waldheim got the 
scholarship of 130 reichsmarks to continue his studies for the 
year the world jewish congress said 
an american graduate student in vienna richard mitten found 
the document in archives at the consular academy and provided it to 
the world jewish congress which gave it to the justice department 
it shows the big lie as to waldheims claim that he was not a 
nazi supporter while a student in vienna neal sher chief war 
crimes prosecutor at the justice department told the new york 
times 
austrian embassy spokesman ulf pacher said schoolmates 
contradicted the letter saying waldheim was stridently antinazi 
while at the academy other than the letter there is no evidence 
to support the theory that waldheim was a nazi at the academy 
pacher said told the times 
the embassy provided two affidavits from schoolmates the times 
reported george weidenfeld who published waldheims memoirs in 
britain said waldheim voiced definitely antiracist views and 
had many jewish friends at the academy susanne lederer a dutch 
woman who attended the academy also said waldheim clearly opposed 
the nazis though he kept silent in public 
waldheim has been trying to persuade the justice department to 
remove his name from a list of people who are banned from entering 
the united states because of their activities in world war ii 
in 1986 the justice department found evidence that waldheim had 
persecuted jews greeks and yugoslavs after he joined the german 
army 
waldheim who has been shown to lie about his years during the 
war and after the war has now been shown to lie about his years 
before the war elan steinberg executive director of the world

mark nicoll sat in his home watching a 
movie on television the screen showed a community being overrun by 
fire 
for nicoll it was just another example of art imitating life 
outside a fiery mass of lava crept inexorably toward his uninsured 
home it will be the second time he has lost a home to kilauea 
volcano and the insatiable volcano goddess pele 
life in the rural coastal kalapana gardens subdivision is 
surreal as residents scramble to save their homes while tourists 
flock to photograph the majestic coastline and the impending doom 
hawaii county civil defense administrator harry kim predicts 
that in less than a week the remaining homes two historic churches 
and the lone general store will be swallowed up by the oozing lava 
that now measures 8 miles long and 600 yards wide and travels up to 
a foot a minute at times 
since it started erupting on jan 3 1983 kilauea has consumed 
114 homes three of them on saturday in the four subdivisions 
that made up the community of kalapana no one has been killed but 
property damage over the seven years has been estimated at 25 
million 
kalapana gardens is the only subdivision left and the clock is 
running out fewer than 50 homes remain but a precise number is 
difficult to determine as residents hasten to take apart the houses 
to move them elsewhere 
gov john waihee declared kalapana a disaster area saturday a 
move that opens the way for lowinterest loans and other assistance 
officials from the federal emergency management agency were 
expected to tour the area monday and make an assessment 
nicoll and his wife belinda built their current home in 1986 
after losing a home to kilauea the year before they said they 
loved the area too much to leave despite the risk 
the nicolls dont have insurance because companies stopped 
offering coverage after a 1986 flow ravaged the area now the 
couple must choose between letting their home burn or taking it 
apart board by board 
they are paralyzed because they have no money to buy other 
property to put their home on still they must move 
i never thought it was going to get this close said nicoll 
were so stressed out from this 
weve been putting it off as long as we can said mrs 
nicoll when you have no place to go 
michael stephens home went thursday giving him the dubious 
honor of being the 100th homeowner to lose a house he had 
insurance because he moved to the subdivision in 1983 when 
policies were easily obtained he said he will move to california 
with the money from his 60000 settlement 
stephens was angry however over what he called the states 
lack of aid to the area the state is at fault for not appointing 
insurance companies to the areas affected by redlining he said 
people dont care they think were stupid for being here 
walter yamaguchi is the 82yearold owner of the kalapana store 
amp drivein which he has operated since 1974 he has lived in the 
area since the 1920s and says he is not leaving 
pele is going to stop he said of the hawaiian goddess 
she will never take me away from here 
a lot of people are scared but i tell them take it easy he 
said i tell them whats the difference let pele have it if 
she wants 
the lava was 425 yards from the little store saturday 
workers began removing the stained glass windows friday from 
starofthesea catholic church which the locals call the painted 
church because of its brightly decorated interior services were 
still scheduled for sunday at the nearly 100yearold church said 
kini pea the custodian 
moving companies have offered to move the church and neighboring 
kalapana mauna kea congregational church free of charge 
well try to remove as much of the inside as possible the 
custodian said 
moving companies are offering free or reduced rate service to 
residents helping to pack their belongings or move their homes 
kim said in an interview thursday night as he monitored the lava 
flow that the last month has been one of the most frustrating in 
his 12 years as head of the agency 
my frustrations build on a personal feeling that we are losing 
a part of hawaii this is our land and our home said kim who 
lives in hilo the county seat about 30 miles north of the 
subdivision 
at the red cross emergency center adjacent to the civil defense 
command post volunteers pass out food to the nearly 100 people who 
have lost their homes and are living in tents in harry k brown 
park 
theyre disoriented now said gary poretsky who used to 
live in the area and has returned to help friends you hate to 
see people lose their homes but people are adaptable and they can 
relocate 
red cross volunteer james schilling says fights have broken out 
sporadically at the park because some people cant accept the fact 
they are unable to halt the destruction 
its getting intense he said people are starting to 
realize its no joke

thousands of workers sunday hurled 
rocks at police and shouted antigovernment slogans to protest a 
raid that crushed a threeday strike at the worlds largest 
shipyard 
about 2500 workers fought running street battles in the dense 
fog of tear gas near the hyundai heavy industries co shipyard 
outside the industrial city of ulsan about 200 miles southest of 
seoul 
there were no immediate reports of casualties in sundays 
renewed fighting at least 24 people including 10 policemen were 
injured when police stormed the shipyard and then clashed with 
workers in the streets of this city during much of saturday 
the strike began wednesday over of the arrests of four union 
leaders who participated in earlier protests and obstructing work 
at the company wage negotiations were scheduled to begin last 
friday but workers said wages were not a main issue in the strike 
on sunday groups of up to 200 workers threw rocks and other 
objects at police after massing in back alleys in a residential 
area facing the shipyard some workers used slingshots to shoot 
rocks at the police who retaliated with tear gas 
down with president roh taewoo workers shouted as they 
raised clenched fists into the air 
at one point about 300 riot police were driven by workers into 
a small factory where they were isolated for more than one hour 
workers blocked their exit by piling broken furniture at the 
plants gate and setting it on fire the police were rescued later 
by colleagues 
some residents apparently relatives of shipyard workers jeered 
at police 
about 13000 riot police reinforced their battle lines as 
workers vowed to continue demonstrations to protest saturdays 
police attack on the shipyard 
police said they were investigating charges against some of the 
607 workers detained in saturdays clashes 
on saturday evening labor unions of the shipyards nine hyundai 
subsidiaries in the city said they would stage sympathy strikes 
on sunday police set up checkpoints and roadblocks and searched 
all vehicles traveling toward the shipyard located 2 miles from 
this city more police were seen patrolling around the city 
at the shipyard about 150 workers continued to hold out on top 
of a giant 240foot crane sunday occasionally shouting slogans 
which were inaudible in winds they hung down a huge slogan 
reading lets win collective bargaining and achieve our dream of 
owning houses 
police spread nets and air mattresses around the base of the 
crane for fear that angry workers may commit suicide in despair 
reports said the group had enough food and homemade arms to hold 
out for at least 15 days 
squads of riot police guarded each of the five main gates to the 
shipyard and checked all visitors several hyundai office workers 
were busy removing remains of burned workers tents arms and rocks 
littered around 
at dawn saturday about 13000 riot police stormed the closed 
shipyard to rout about 2000 workers about 24000 people work at 
the complex 
authorities fired hundreds of teargas shells from at least 10 
armored vans as bulldozers tore down 9foothigh barricades erected 
by the workers the riot police rushed in wearing gas masks and 
helmets and carrying clubs and shields 
hundreds of workers retaliated by throwing firebombs steel 
bars rocks and pieces of metal strikers fired several rounds from 
at least one of about a dozen homemade cannons but it was not 
known if anyone was injured by the blasts 
the fighting spread to the streets where some estimates said up 
to 20000 workers battled police television footage showed police 
kicking and beating some workers with clubs as they led them away 
to police vans 
twentytwo police vehicles were damaged or destroyed including 
two buses and five fire engines police and reports said 
authorities closed major roads in the area suspended flights 
and canceled classes at 26 schools 
leaders of the shipyard union said they would hold talks sunday 
to discuss strategy with workers from other hyundai companies they 
said 15 of 32 hyundai company unions pledged to support the strike 
the hyundai group owner of the shipyard and one of south 
koreas largest conglomerates is the major employer in this city 
of 648000 with well over 100000 employees hyundai makes ships 
cars electronics steel and other products 
hyundai had requested government action to end the strike after 
negotiations broke down hours before 
last year about 12000 police stormed the hyundai shipyard to 
end a bitter 109day strike 
it is extremely regrettable the government carried out a 
militarystyle operation to suppress the workers strike said 
kim taeshik spokesman for the opposition party for peace and 
democracy he urged the government to release the union leaders 
hundreds of radical students protested saturday at campuses in 
inchon and kwangju denouncing the police action against strikers 
the south korean news agency yonhap said 
in seoul ahn dongsu union leader at the state korean 
broadcasting system said broadcast operations would return to 
normal monday ending a 17dayold protest prompted over a new 
governmentappointed president 
ahn said he had received assurances the network president a 
former government spokesman would resign at an early date 
it was unclear whether the decision would be accepted by the 
5000member union which had said its new boss was restricting 
press freedoms

discovery returned home 
from its fiveday telescope delivery mission today landing at this 
windswept desert air force base after a fiery plunge through the 
atmosphere 
welcome back congratulations on a super mission the world is 
looking forward to reaping the benefits of your good work over the 
next 15 years said mission controls steve oswald 
we sure enjoyed it also it was great fun said commander 
loren j shriver 
left in space by the five discovery astronauts was the hubble 
space telescope a 15 billion marvel that when it begins 
operating properly will look for evidence of the birth of the 
universe and for planets orbiting a sun much like ours 
mission control delayed its permission for discovery to leave 
orbit until almost the last minute after watching a night of 
shifting winds discovery was directed to a concrete runway 
instead of the planned hardpacked desert strip because wind 
conditions were better there 
shriver and pilot charles bolden took over the controls from the 
shuttles computers the last few minutes also in the crew were 
mission specialists steven hawley bruce mccandless and kathryn 
sullivan 
the arrival was heralded by the usual two sonic booms sweeping 
across the desert the dawning sun glinted off the ships 
underside the landing was exactly on time at 950 am edt 
twenty thousand people many wrapped in blankets for protection 
against the wind cheered as the shuttle touched down there were a 
few scattered clouds 
the shuttle had circled earth 75 times since its launch tuesday 
from the kennedy space center in florida traveling more than 
2068213 miles 
shriver fired discoverys two orbital maneuvering engines for 
nearly five minutes over the east coast of africa 380 miles high 
and traveling 17400 mph the firing slowed the ship by nearly 400 
mph and it headed toward earth entering the atmosphere over the 
pacific between new guinea and hawaii 
the shuttle is the first to be equipped with new carbon brakes 
nasa would have preferred to land discovery on the longer desert 
runway because it would have provided more margin for a slow 
rolling stop that would not tax the brakes 
the carbon brakes can withstand longer stopping distances and 
higher temperatures than the older carbonlined beryllium brakes 
their lifetime is expected to be 50 landings the older brakes are 
designed for only six 
the hubble telescope has been troublesome from the day it was 
put overboard by astronaut steven hawley and is still crippled with 
its highdata rate antennas locked into unusable positions 
however engineers guiding the telescopes checkout managed 
overnight to transmit recorded data about the antenna problems over 
a secondary lowgain antenna they expect to get clues to fixing 
the problem 
the telescope is an apparatus of almost limitless vision that is 
expected to provide astronomical data for 15 years revealing 
celestial secrets dating back to the time the universe was created 
the 12ton telescope with the smoothest mirror ever made was 
released from the shuttle cargo bay on wednesday its lens was 
uncovered in space for the first time on friday 
when controllers moved the telescopes highspeed antenna and 
again when the lens cover was opened the actions moved the 
telescope too much and an automatic system shut down the 
electronics it took more than a day to restore them

pakistan on sunday dismissed 
allegations of interference in indianheld kashmir as false and 
untenable and accused india of whipping up a war psychosis and 
indulging in sabrerattling 
but the no 2ranking defense official said a hotline between 
senior military commanders of india and pakistan remains open and 
the tense situation between the uneasy neighbors is gradually 
moving toward normalcy 
the remarks by a foreign ministry spokesman and the deputy 
defense minister col ghulam sarwar cheema were in response to 
indias latest charges pakistan is arming and training moslem 
separatists in indiancontrolled kashmir 
no amount of sophistry can hide the fact that the insurrection 
there is totally indigenous the foreign ministry spokesman said 
the root of the insurrection is the continued denial of the right 
of selfdetermination of the people in indianoccupied kashmir 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said pakistan was deeply disappointed by the false 
allegations and untenable assertions made saturday by the indian 
government 
new delhi warned pakistan it would not tolerate infringement of 
its sovereignty in kashmir and a government spokesman refused to 
rule out crossborder raids to eliminate suspected guerrilla camps 
there will be no compromise on the measures necessary to 
protect our integrity the indian government said in a statement 
the foreign ministry spokesman said pakistan regrets india has 
persisted in its belicose statements after the foreign minister of 
india in new york three days ago agreed with his pakistan 
counterpart to exercise restraint 
more than 300 people have been killed in indianheld kashmir 
since jan 20 when indian troops launched their latest and harshest 
crackdown on moslem separatists most were moslem militants or 
supporters shot by indian troops during antiindia demonstrations 
or while defying curfews 
india regularly accuses pakistan of arming training and 
financing the kashmiri militants who want to secede from mostly 
hindu india and become an independent nation with neutral status 
islamabad routinely denies the allegations but says it supports 
the kashmiris right to selfdetermination 
instead of whipping up a war psychosis and indulging in 
sabrerattling we hope india will align its position to the 
position of the international community which stands for the 
peaceful settlement of the kashmir dispute the foreign ministry 
spokesman said 
as violence by moslem militants escalated both countries 
reinforced their troops along the border and the contested kashmir 
frontier each side has repeatedly said it does not want war but 
has accused the other of fomenting a climate that could lead to 
armed confrontation 
new delhi has repeatedly denied allegations of abuse and torture 
by indian troops in kashmir 
india and pakistan have fought two wars over kashmir which is 
divided by a ceasefire line monitored by the united nations 
kashmir was a princely state when india and pakistan were 
partitioned along religious lines into separate nations most of 
kashmirs residents were moslems but the ruler was a hindu who 
opted for union with india 
pakistan moved into the northern third of kashmir the rest came 
under indian control as part of the state of jammukashmir the 
only moslem state in india 
pakistan does not want another war and no saner elements 
either in india or pakistan will support war cheema told 
reporters in rawalpindi 
the hotline is still open between the senior military 
commanders of the two countries and pakistan is taking all steps to 
reduce tension

seventeen years ago congress took a small 
step toward national health insurance when it decided to take on 
the costs of lifesaving treatment for nearly all americans whose 
kidneys had failed 
it was supposed to cost about 200 million a year 
today the cost is more than 33 billion 
if the kidney program were to come up today it would be 
completely dead in the water because of the obsession to bring 
costs down said arthur caplan head of the university of 
minnesotas center for biomedical ethics 
the reason we dont have national health insurance is the 
kidney program he said the costs associated with it scared 
legislators out of their gourds 
in the early 1970s government money was flowing more freely and 
only dollars stood in the way of lifesaving treatment for the many 
thousands of people whose kidneys failed 
the success rate of kidney transplants was up but this option 
was expensive and limited by the supply of donated organs 
the other effective option the artificial kidney machine that 
cleans the blood of toxins in a process called dialysis was also 
expensive however the number of patients who needed the 
relatively new procedure was far greater than the supply of 
machines could handle 
lifesaving treatment was being rationed by hospital committees 
that were deciding essentially who would live and who would die 
the technology to save lives was there as sen vance hartke 
dind posed the question on the senate floor in 1972 how do we 
explain that the difference between life and death is a matter of 
dollars 
that year congress extended medicare coverage to nearly all 
patients in the advanced stages of kidney disease regardless of 
age 
with this coverage patients pay about 20 percent of the cost of 
treatment whether transplant or dialysis and the federal 
government pays 80 percent 
the medical industry responded by building dialysis treatment 
centers across the country there are now about 1800 centers with 
80 to 90 added each year 
more than 80 percent of dialysis patients go to one of these 
centers three times a week for treatments that last four to six 
hours each at a cost of about 25000 to 30000 annually the 
remainder are treated in their homes at around 20000 a year 
caplan asserts that the kidney program has been a bonanza for 
forprofit medicine and says the programs price tag could be cut 
considerably if the government encouraged more home treatment in 
britain he said 66 percent of dialysis patients are treated in 
their homes 
but that issue aside even in the early years of the program it 
was apparent that congress had vastly underestimated the cost of 
dialysis and transplants which now run about 25000 per patient 
plus several thousand dollars a year for antirejection drugs 
and as the costs rose steadily the profile of kidney patients 
getting the lifesaving treatment changed 
before the program three of four dialysis patients were men 
most were welleducated almost 42 percent had jobs 91 percent 
were white and only 7 percent were over 55 by 1981 more than 45 
percent were over 55 half were women 35 percent were black and 
only 18 percent were working researchers reported at the time 
now the elderly are the fastest growing group on dialysis with 
about 30 percent of patients over 65 
physicians are under a great deal of pressure from family and 
patients to use dialysis even when the prognosis is poor said 
daniel callahan director of the hastings center in briarciff 
manor ny an independent nonprofit research organization that 
examines ethical issues in medicine 
the latest government figures available put the cost of the 
program in 1987 at 33 billion and rising by about 300 million a 
year some 147000 patients had coverage under the program at some 
time in that year 
we have chosen not to make difficult choices with this 
disease said paul rettig executive director of the american 
hospital association the money is in the medicare program 
and we made a financial choice to pay for it 
but government money does not flow so freely now and lawmakers 
are looking around every corner for places to cut the budget 
few suggest turning back the clock with repeal of the kidney 
program but some question use of transplants and dialysis in 
marginal patients those who have other medical problems and 
are not likely to live long in any event 
the fundamental question is how scarce resources should be 
spread among all who need them said richard a rettig who is 
directing an institute of medicine study on the kidney program 
this is one of those things we recognize as a source of 
anxiety we walk up to it and walk away from it and walk around it 
because we have no way to decently confront it directly he said 
the renal world did confront it in the 1960s they were 
relieved from doing so in the 70s and 80s he said but the 
question doesnt go away

on a sunny morning one year ago 
parishioners of the olive branch united brethren church sat in 
puzzled silence waiting for the rev robert l pelley to walk from 
the modest parsonage and step into the pulpit 
a church member finally went to the parsonage and unlocked the 
door 
the body of the 38yearold pastor lay sprawled in a narrow 
hallway outside his bedroom in a basement recreation room lay the 
bodies of his wife dawn 32 and her daughters 8yearold janel 
and jolene 6 all four had been shot to death the day before 
april 29 1989 
three older children were not at home and survived 
police worked without success to amass enough evidence to make 
an arrest 
in autumn olive branch at last got a new pastor don dennie a 
hoosier native who had lived out west most of the past two decades 
dennie 58 found the congregation distraught and even fearful 
of the parsonage so dennie and his wife gloria decided to hold 
an open house to dispel the fears 
we made sure everybody went all the way through the house 
especially the basement he said in a recent interview 
theyre doing well dennie said of his parishioners 
but things have changed little in the police investigation the 
case remains open and the investigation active says st joseph 
county sheriffs sgt charles feirrell investigators report no 
progress toward an arrest 
police unsuccessfully searched the surrounding fields woods and 
ponds for the shotgun used in the slayings laboratory tests on 
evidence taken from the home yielded no signficant clues 
the surviving children are jackie then 14 jessica 10 and 
robert j known to family and friends as jeff 18 
the pelleys had married after the deaths of their spouses jeff 
and jackie were pelleys children from his first marriage jessica 
janel and jolene came from mrs pelleys first marriage 
jackie was attending a church camp when the killings occurred 
and jessica had spent the night with friends jeff told police he 
had left home that afternoon to attend his high school prom and was 
away overnight for postprom activities then drove with friends 
sunday to an amusement park north of chicago 
jackie and jessica now live with relatives in other states 
jackie in burlington ky and her sister in eaton county mich 
jeff pelley enrolled in manchester college last fall but dropped 
out and is working for a cabinetmaker in nappanee dennie said 
he could not be reached for comment he has an unlisted number 
its a very disconcerting thing to know it hasnt been solved 
yet said dennie 
police questioned jeff pelley for several hours the evening 
after the bodies were discovered and then allowed him to go 
investigators that night hinted of a possible suspect but quickly 
backed away the next day 
police have never identified a suspect they ruled out burglary 
and robbery almost immediately but otherwise have refused to 
discuss a motive 
the rev don merrilatt a colleague of pelleys said pelley had 
talked to him about friction among the children as the remarried 
couple worked to unite two families 
every family trying to merge has these pressures merrilatt 
said three days after the slayings the children have allegiance 
to their first father and mother there are natural difficulties 
there

despite improvement in global health two of five 
deaths still occur from preventable causes according to a survey 
published sunday by the world health organization 
about 200 million people may still die of preventable diseases 
in the 1990s if the current trend continues but that many could 
be saved if more money were spent on health care said the un 
agencys directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima 
many of the worlds illnesses are preventable or treatable 
with inexpensive vaccines antibiotics or oral rehydration 
therapy he said in commenting on the 56page survey 
with the decrease in global military tension there may be 
more money to fight the worldwide war on disease he added we 
are looking for a health dividend 
the survey says the 50 million people dying worldwide from all 
causes each year include 145 million children under the age of 5 
in developing countries 
more than 8000 children die each day because they are not 
immunized almost 11000 a day die of dehydration caused by 
diarrhea and about 8000 a day of pneumonia 
the cost of immunizing all children and providing medication 
for dehydration and pneumonia is estimated to be about 25 billion 
a year it said adding such efforts could save 75 million 
children a year 
the report did not say how much now is spent on such 
immunization and medical care 
the report stresses a change in lifestyle would prevent one of 
two early deaths due to cardiovascular diseases it also estimates 
that 3 million adults die annually from tobaccorelated 
diseases 
the prevention of these deaths is the most simple of all 
the report said 
hepatitis b a liver infection blamed in 1 million to 2 million 
deaths per year is listed as the most prevalent disease worldwide 
who estimates that more than 2 billion people or about two fifths 
of the worlds total population are infected with the hepatitisb 
virus hbv 
it adds that hbv infection is now preventable with a safe and 
effective vaccine 
a combined 14 to 16 billion people are estimated to be 
suffering from ascariasis and hookworm intestinal parasitic 
infections that are particularly widespread in tropical zones 
cardiovascular diseases with an annual 12 million deaths are 
listed as the biggest single killer followed by diarrheal 
diseases 5 million cancer and pneumonia 48 million each 
tuberculosis 3 million and chronic lung diseases 27 million 
malaria with an estimated annual toll of 1 to 2 million deaths 
and whooping cough which kills about 500000 are also ranked well 
ahead of aids estimated to claim about 200000 lives annually 
worldwide 
the agency which in 1977 proclaimed a goal of health for all 
by the year 2000 said the health situation remains worst in 
southest asia where about 40 percent of the regions total 
population of 12 billion suffers from malnutrition and diseases 
ranging from diarrhea to malaria 
in subsaharan africa about 30 percent are ill in south and 
central america the share is 25 percent the same as in north 
africa and the middle east 
in the past decade health care has brought some significant 
improvements the agency said life expectancy in the developing 
countries is now estimated to average 597 years which it said 
represented a sharp rise in the developed countries it has 
reached 734 years

authorities investigated nearly 500 cases of 
people injured or killed because of torture illegal detention or 
other police abuses during the first three months of this year a 
state prosecutor said 
the number far exceeds previous official figures for abuses by 
police which china acknowledges but insists are rare and are 
punished when discovered 
liang guoqing deputy chief procurator of the supreme peoples 
procuratorate told a news conference saturday that the government 
had dealt with more than 9500 cases in the first quarter of 1990 
involving dereliction of duty and infringement of citizens rights 
by police or other law enforcement officials 
he said priority was given to cases of extorting confessions by 
torture illegal detention neglect of duty and taking bribes to 
distort justice 
among these were more than 490 major cases involving deaths 
and injuries the official xinhua news agency quoted him as 
saying 
it did not give details of any of the cases 
by comparison ren jianxin president of the supreme peoples 
court said last year that there had been 4700 cases in all of 
1988 involving police torture frameups illegal detention and 
other abuses of which only 227 resulted in injury or death 
china began acknowledging police abuses including torture in 
the mid1980s but has always insisted that these are isolated cases 
that violate police policy 
many such cases occur in rural areas where police are poorly 
educated but the root cause is the broad power wielded by police 
over civilians despite a legal code put in place over the past 
decade 
none of the official reports on torture and other abuses 
including saturdays have mentioned cases involving political 
dissidents china maintains that it has no political prisoners and 
that dissidents are jailed only for specific actions such as making 
counterrevolutionary propaganda or seeking to overthrow the 
communist party 
released dissidents have reported being forced to wear tight 
handcuffs for days being placed in very cramped cells and being 
deprived of sleep

nepals new prime minister demanded the 
resignation of the countrys 14 top regional administrators sunday 
many of whom had supported a police crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
krishna prasad bhattarai a leader of the prodemocracy 
campaign did not specify why he had asked for the resignation of 
the himalayan countrys 14 zonal commissioners 
but bhattarai said he told the officials during a meeting in the 
capital katmandu that their office had become redundant in 
nepals emerging multiparty democracy 
also sunday a governmentrun newspaper reported the countrys 
former hardline prime minister has declared his support for the 
new interim government headed by bhattarai 
the englishlanguage rising nepal newspaper said marich man 
singh shrestha delivered a statement by telephone late saturday to 
the staterun news agency rashtriya samachar samiti 
it was the first reported statement by shrestha since he went 
into hiding after being dismissed april 6 by king birendra for 
failing to maintain law and order 
the newspaper which gave no details of shresthas wherabouts 
said he expressed confidence the interim government would receive 
the cooperation of all 
bhattarai said his government also was not aware of where 
shrestha was hiding but said the former prime ministers support 
shows that wisdom has dawned on him 
shresthas statement came amid growing demands from parties 
within the new government coalition for his arrest and prosecution 
and similar action against other members of his administration 
the centrist nepali congress party a coalition member has 
ruled out hasty arrests a party spokesman has said the new 
government will not be vindictive toward members of the countrys 
former partyless government known as the panchayat 
the interim government composed of prodemocracy leaders from 
the nepali congress party and the united left front a coalition of 
leftist parties took office april 19 the 11member cabinet also 
includes two independents and two birendra nominees 
bhattarai the nepali congress party president said there was 
no immediate reaction from the regaional commissioners to his call 
for their resignation 
but gp koirala the congress partys general secretary said 
if they have any sense they will resign immediately 
nepals 14 zones cover the countrys 75 districts and the 
commissioners who are appointed by the king wield almost total 
control over the executive judicial and legislative branches in 
their areas 
many of the commissioners conveyed to police the hardline 
governments orders to shoot prodemocracy demonstrators april 6 
according to the royal palace the crackdown left 10 people dead 
and 107 injured throughout the country on april 6 but witnesses 
said at least 200 people were killed in katmandu alone 
the ensuing outcry forced birendra to lift a 29yearold ban on 
political parties and dismantle the partyless system of government 
which he dominated

the leading abortionrights group has built up 
a political warchest this year nearly seven times as large as the 
funds held by the chief antiabortion organization but that lead 
may not last long 
the political action committee for the national abortion rights 
action league raised more than 300000 in the first three months 
of this year while the national right to life pac raised just over 
7000 according to federal disclosure reports 
narals pac ended the quarter with 347000 in the bank 
compared with 51000 for national right to life according to 
federal election commission records 
the lopsided pace of fund raising could end soon however an 
antiabortion rally in washington on saturday attracted some 
200000 people and the national right to life pac is preparing to 
launch its annual direct mail campaign this spring 
the pac has demonstrated before it can raise substantial sums 
quickly it had 3400 on hand at the end of june 1989 but raised 
460000 in the second half of the year 
most of that money however was spent on special congressional 
elections and gubernatorial races in which abortionrights 
candidates were overwhelmingly successful 
those results led to some speculation that the prolife forces 
would lie low or be shunned by candidates this year but leaders of 
the national right to life pac have promised to be even more active 
sandra faucher director of the pac said she was confident 
well be able to raise as much as it takes 
we never raise funds in the first quarter she said we 
have our own agenda and dont worry about what anyone else is 
raising 
indeed just last year the national right to life pac quickly 
erased a similar naral edge 
so far this year naral has been more aggressive in raising and 
spending money on congressional elections according to quarterly 
reports filed with the fec a second abortionrights pac voters 
for choice raised 111000 in the januarymarch period the 
records show 
the response to our fundraising appeals has been 
overwhelming and it shows what an important voting issue choice is 
to people naral spokeswoman loretta ucelli said 
the reports do not include money raised by separate pacs the 
national organizations maintain to contribute to state races a 
major abortion battleground in the wake of the last years supreme 
court decision giving states more authority to restrict abortions 
those state funds however generally get most of their money 
from their federal affiliates also not included are generic 
political expenses the groups are allowed to finance with general 
treasury funds 
narals pac reported it had raised 308000 so far this year and 
spent 142000 of which 42000 was contributed to federal 
candidates or other pacs 
the right to life pac reported receipts of 7200 in the 
januarymarch period and contributions of 4100 to congressional 
candidates and 5000 to the north carolina right to life pac 
in addition to the national right to life pac there are dozens 
of state right to life organizations with federal pacs that support 
congressional candidates most of them however reported little or 
no fund raising in the first quarter according to fec records 
the only such state groups raising more than 5000 in the 
period were in california ohio and illinois 
much of the congressional campaign activity for pacs involved in 
the abortion debate depends on the outcome of upcoming primary 
elections 
despite their different approaches to fund raising the naral 
and national right to life pacs are relatively close in total 
receipts so far in the twoyear election cycle according to fec 
records the national right to life pac has raised 506000 since 
january 1989 compared with naral pacs 591000 
but when the steady fund raising of voters for choice is 
factored in the abortionrights forces have a clear fundraising 
advantage 
voters for choice has raised 577000 in the past 16 months it 
has made donations to a dozen candidates so far this year while 
spending the bulk of its money on new fundraising appeals

tens of thousands of people demanded 
the resignation of interim president ion iliescu on sunday in one 
of the largest anticommunist demonstrations in timisoara since the 
december revolution 
in bucharest an antigovernment protest in downtown university 
square entered its eighth day with up to 10000 people taking part 
similar protests occurred in other parts of the country and one 
large proiliescu rally was reported in transylvania 
timisoara in western romania is the cradle of the popular 
uprising that toppled hardline communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu on dec 22 it is described as romanias martyr city 
because of the blood that was shed there during clashes between 
demonstrators and ceausescus security forces 
down with iliescu down with communism shouted the 40000 
people who overflowed victory squrare in timisoara 300 miles west 
of the capital the square was the site of fierce fighting during 
the december revolution 
others shouted if we vote for iliescu its like voting for 
ceausescu 
iliescu is a running for president in the may 20 election and 
his national salvation front has dominated the interim government 
that will run the country until then he and the front have often 
been the target of protests 
observers believe the fronts prominence in the interim 
government has given its candidates an advantage in the election 
which is crowded with candidates from dozens of new and 
reestablished political parties 
a former communist party secretary under ceausescu iliescu fell 
out of favor with the former dictator and was given relatively 
unimportant party posts he gained prominence during the december 
revolution the most violent of the prodemocracy revolts that 
swept through eastern europe last year 
romanians seeking iliescus resignation accuse him and others in 
the national salvation front of seeking to reestablish some form of 
communism in the country despite repeated assertions that the 
front embraces democracy 
several thousand people also demonstrated against iliescu in the 
black sea port of constanta on sunday state radio reported 
the state news agency rompres said that tens of thousands of 
iliescu supporters attended a campaign rally for him in the 
transylvanian city of cluj it said antiiliescu protesters 
gathered in the city afterward 
in bucharest protesters vowed to continue their vigil until the 
may 20 election protesters in the capital waved banners 
proclaiming the square a neocommunismfree zone 
a speaker at the bucharest rally stelian tanase of the group 
for social dialogue said of the government they are offering us 
communism in a sweet box we want sweeping changes not 
perestroika a reference to the economic and political reforms 
being tried in the soviet union 
a government spokesman who requested anonymity described the 
bucharest protest as a demonstration of the extreme right 
many protesters in timisoara wore badges saying im a thug 
a defiant allusion iliescus description of the bucharest 
demonstrators as thugs 
if iliescu does not go it would be a betrayal of the 
revolution one of the protesters dana serbac said if he 
stays it would be a waste of blood spilled here last december 
immediately after the revolution romanian and foreign media 
said up to 4000 people died in timisoara in clashes with 
ceausescus securitate troops but romanian officials later said 
that only about 100 people died in timisoara 
several speakers at the rally on sunday accused iliescu of 
hiding the real death toll of the revolution some of them said 
that under iliescu former ceausescu loyalists still hold senior 
administrative positions 
doina cornea one of the speakers and a former prominent member 
of the national salvation front said in an interview that she left 
the organization in january because it abuses its ruling position 
to grab power 
cornea a popular former dissident also accused iliescu of 
being a soviet man claiming that the soviet union is 
supporting him in order to bring communism back to romania 
antisoviet sentiment was rife at the timisoara rally too with 
the crowd chanting iliescukgb and russians forget about 
romania 
george zurebie a national peasants party leader accused 
iliescu in an interview of doing nothing to uncover members of 
the hated securitate secret police who have allegedly eluded 
authorities

conservative senators reacting to a supreme 
court decision they say gives too much power to federal judges are 
calling for a constitutional amendment to prohibit courts from 
ordering local officials to raise taxes 
if the american people are to be taxed they are to be taxed 
only by those who are elected sen john c danforth rmo told 
the senate last week as he sought to build support for the measure 
the proposed amendment was introduced by danforth and fellow 
missouri republican christopher bond on april 20 two days after 
the high court ruled in a missouri case that a federal judge has 
the power to order a local government to increase taxes 
in a 54 ruling the justices said us district court judge 
russell g clark had the authority in a 1987 case to order kansas 
city school officials to ignore a state law limiting property taxes 
and direct them raise taxes to pay for a courtordered 
desegregation plan 
clark ordered a doubling of local property taxes to finance 260 
million in renovations in predominantly black schools after voters 
in the school district had repeatedly rejected proposals to raise 
taxes for education 
a local government with taxing authority may be ordered to 
levy taxes in excess of the limit set by state statute where there 
is reason based in the constitution for not observing the statutory 
limitation justice byron r white wrote for the high court 
danforths proposed constitutional amendment has attracted 17 
senate cosponsors including one democrat sen james exon 
dneb said he might add his name to the list after i know more 
about it 
amending the constitution requires a twothirds majority in each 
house of congress or 67 votes in the senate and 290 votes in the 
house of representatives in addition the amendment would have to 
be ratified by threefourths or 38 of the nations 50 states within 
seven years of congressional approval 
thus far no senate committee action on the proposed amendment is 
planned although the sponsors have requested a hearing before the 
judiciary committee 
while there is no indication danforths measure will gain the 
support it needs for senate approval in the near future the number 
of cosponsors shows the concern that the courts ruling has raised 
among conservatives 
this is the ultimate excess of judicial activism said sen 
gordon humphrey rnh who introduced a separate measure of his 
own that would prohibit judges by statute from ordering tax 
increases 
danforth took the senate floor three times last week to denounce 
the decision 
he said the court has transformed the principle of no taxation 
without representation into little more than a quaint relic of 
our past something that went out with powdered wigs and hoop 
skirts and horses and buggies 
when the supreme court of the united states decides that a 
federal district judge can direct the imposition of taxes the 
supreme court is turning on its head one of the most basic premises 
that we hold in this country he said 
also cosponsoring the measure are sen david boren dokla 
and republican sens bob dole and nancy kassebaum of kansas 
malcolm wallop of wyoming steve symms and james mcclure of idaho 
pete wilson of california john mccain of arizona don nickles of 
oklahoma ted stevens of alaska jesse helms of north carolina dan 
coats of indiana connie mack of florida orrin hatch and jake garn 
of utah conrad burns of montana and alfonse damato of new york

a bomb exploded sunday at a 
border customs post and security forces tipped to a renewed irish 
republican army offensive were on increased alert throughout 
northern ireland 
the royal ulster constabulary said the bomb caused minor damage 
to a hut in the customs complex near the town of newry about 35 
miles southwest of belfast on the border with the irish republic 
no injuries were reported 
the ira claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement 
to news media it said two unexploded devices remained at the post 
it was the fifth bombrelated incident reported by police in the 
past two days in northern ireland 
the incidents follow a public warning issued thursday by 
northern irelands police headquarters which said it had received 
intelligence reports that the ira planned a heightened offensive 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in protestantdominated 
northern ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly roman 
catholic irish republic 
also sunday police said two motorists escaped serious injury 
when they drove over two bombs planted in the road at castlewellan 
south of belfast 
an army bomb disposal officer who defused the devices said it 
was a miracle that these dangerous bombs did not go off as a 
couple of cars drove over them 
on saturday security forces defused a 900pound bomb left in an 
abandoned van on a housing estate in dungannon about 35 miles west 
of belfast the royal ulster constabulary said 
lawmaker ken maginnis of the moderate largely protestant ulster 
unionist party said if the bomb left on the housing estate had 
exploded there would have been multiple deaths and serious 
injuries 
police said four masked men hijacked the van from a family 
before planting the bomb a spokesman said it was unclear who the 
intended victim was 
dungannon almost evenly divided between protestants and 
catholics has frequently been the target of ira bombs and there 
have been many attacks on its police station 
another bomb was found on a bus traveling from central belfast 
to the citys aldergrove airport and police said without 
elaborating that a woman was being held for questioning 
a bomb attached to a lamppost in lisburn south of belfast 
exploded saturday while police and british army troops evacuated 
the area 
more than 2700 people have been killed in northern ireland 
since british troops arrived in august 1969 to separate rioting 
protestants from their catholic neighbors

with surprising speed the european 
community has launched a drive for political union with little or 
no idea of the final outcome 
will the 12 separate nations with their various languages and 
cultures eventually merge into a sort of united states of europe 
or will they limit themselves to closer cooperation in foreign 
and security matters 
at the end of a special oneday summit in dublin saturday the 
leaders themselves appeared at odds over what they had agreed to do 
clearly they do not quite know what political union means 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said of her colleagues in 
the trading bloc it astounds me 
european unity was a dream born from the rubble of world war ii 
and led to formation of the european community in 1957 now with 
eastern europe in upheaval western europe feels a compulsion to 
act as a kind of counterweight and that means closer ties 
in their final statement the leaders said they confirmed their 
commitment to political union 
they asked their foreign ministers to draw up models for a 
political merger the proposals will be given to the leaders when 
they meet again in dublin in late june 
the new impetus for political closeness came from west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand 
they sent a letter on april 20 to irish prime minister charles 
haughey current ec president urging fellow leaders to 
accelerate the political construction of the europe of the 
twelve 
they said the issue should be discussed at the unscheduled 
summit called by haughey to air concerns over german unification 
kohl later said german unity and european integration were two 
sides of the same coin 
to kohl and mitterrand a political merger means strengthening 
the weak strasbougbased european parliament and other agencies 
that now administer the trading bloc they also want the bodies 
more accountable to the public 
and they see unity as requiring a common foreign and security 
policy 
to mrs thatcher that sounded ambitious coming three days after 
kohl and mitterrand broke ranks with the community over lithuania 
the french and west german leaders issued their own statement 
calling on the soviet republic to suspend its march 11 declaration 
of independence from moscow just five days earlier foreign 
ministers of the dozen nations carefully crafted a plea for 
restraint on both sides 
so there you are this is one thing that makes me realize 
they will never think of giving up national sovereignty which i 
dont criticize im very pleased about mrs thatcher said 
the british leader spelled out what political union shouldnt 
mean tossing out britains queen elizabeth ii doing away with 
national legislatures giving up the ability to declare war 
in the ultimate war or peace is a sovereign decision she 
said 
she also noted the countries maintain different defense postures 
ireland is neutral and france refuses to link its military 
forces to the military command of the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
you simply cannot have a common defense policy in the 
community as it is she said 
even so the other leaders appeared intent on coming up with 
proposals that would give the community more political muscle 
their strength so far has been in the economic area 
they have mounted a campaign to create a vast market of 320 
million consumers by 1993 by then they intend to eliminate the 
many trade barriers preventing the free flow of money people 
goods and services 
already ec nationals can travel without passports among member 
countries there are shared arrangements for health care britons 
are buying second homes in france in anticipation of an underwater 
tunnel that will link the countries in three years 
the governments intend to create an economic and monetary union 
which would lead to a common currency and a europeanwide system of 
central banks they will meet in december to change their founding 
treaty of rome so they can forge the economic links 
on saturday they decided they almost certainly will do the same 
for political union 
weve now embarked on a course of action haughey said 
the whole process is now inevitable

legislation that guarantees the civil rights 
of millions of disabled americans heads for a final house committee 
hearing this week amid steppedup attempts by republicans to change 
it 
the americans with disabilities act commands wide support from 
both parties since only few house members and eight members of the 
senate have been willing to go on record against people with 
handicaps 
the house judiciary committee is scheduled to take up the bill 
tuesday and report it to the full house just as three other house 
committees have done once the house passes the bill it must be 
reconciled with a version the senate passed in 1989 
the act is hailed as the most significant piece of civil rights 
legislation since the landmark civil rights act of 1964 banned 
discrimination based on race color national origin sex and 
religion 
the bill guarantees access to transportation telephone systems 
and businesses professional services and employment it would for 
instance make it unlawful to deny a job or a service to someone on 
the basis of that persons disability or perceived disability 
the disabilities that would be covered arent spelled out but 
testimony and debate make it clear just about anyone with a 
debilitating mental or physical condition including aids is 
protected 
the library of congress estimates 43 million americans are 
disabled but even that list omits large numbers of people who 
would fall under the bills definition 
but a crack has appeared in the compromise with the white house 
that eased the bill through the senate on a 768 vote last 
september the dispute revolves around what sanctions would be 
imposed against employers who discriminate 
business interests especially the smallbusiness lobby are 
still pressing to have certain legal terms more precisely defined 
small businesses represented by the national federation of 
independent business want to be exempt from provisions until 
regulations are drafted then tested on larger companies further 
they want a tax credit for their troubles 
finally rep william e dannemeyer rcalif plans to push an 
amendment that would exclude aids sufferers from protection 
in this weeks markup as the hearing is called the bush 
administration will press its effort to decouple the disabilities 
bill from the civil rights act the two are joined by a reference 
in the disabilities bill to title vii of the 1964 law 
title vii governs employment discrimination and spells out 
remedies for discrimination back pay costs and nonjury trials 
the civil rights advocates who have helped push through the 
disabilities bill support another measure the civil rights act of 
1990 that would add damages to the remedies spelled in title vii 
since the ada defers to title vii regarding remedies amending 
title vii would in essence also amend the ada 
the administration opposes adding damages to adas remedies 
attorney general dick thornburgh in a letter march 12 to 
lawmakers said the administration will actively support such a 
clarifying amendment at tuesdays hearing 
without such a change the deal which got the ada passed in 
the other body and won the support of the administration will be 
undone rep f james sensenbrenner jr rwis said last week 
during a judiciary subcommittees hearing on the bill 
unlike other civil rights bills the legislation also would 
require businesses and transportation providers to spend money on 
physical adjustments such as wheelchair ramps or lifts and 
special services such as a reader 
mary reed a lobbyist for the independent business federation 
said that although the bill contains a number of timetables and 
exemptions designed to ease its impact on business critical 
changes still are needed 
small businesses need to know what is expected of them to comply 
so they can avoid lawsuits she said 
she also said regulations need to be promulgated and tested by 
larger corporations before small businesses which cant afford 
fulltime lawyers can be expected to comply 
finally she said small businesses need a tax credit to pay for 
the adjustments they will need to make to accommodate disabled 
customers and employees

the white government will meet 
with the african national congress for the first time wednesday in 
search of ways to share power with south africas black majority 
president fw de klerk and anc leader nelson mandela are 
expected to make progress and clear the way for constitutional 
talks later this year 
mandela and the african national congress demand an end to the 
state of emergency imposed june 12 1986 release of political 
prisoners and other concessions before full negotiations can begin 
the two sides face enormous challenges in seeking a peaceful 
workable solution to south africas racial divisions violence is 
increasing and elements in both racial groups oppose any settlement 
despite their hopes of a solution de klerk and mandela remain 
far apart on plans for the new south africa both say they want to 
build neither has been able to suggest the differences can be 
resolved 
de klerks government expresses support for a democratic system 
and ending apartheid but opposes simple majority rule contending 
that would lead to black domination de klerk wants veto power for 
whites and safeguards that would preserve much of their wealth and 
privilege 
we believe that majority rule is not suitable for a country 
like south africa because it will lead to the domination and even 
the suppression of minorities de klerk told parliament on april 
17 
while we are honest and genuine in our quest to create equal 
opportunities for all we are not prepared to destroy existing 
rights or allow them to be destroyed 
the anc remains committed to a oneperson onevote system with 
no special privileges for whites and refuses to renounce its 
guerrilla campaign 
anc leaders also must find ways to satsify the needs and 
aspirations of millions of impoverished blacks in south africa 
where blacks outnumber whites more than 5 to 1 
only successful negotiations can convince us to end the armed 
struggle and peace will come as a result of negotiations 
mandela told a rally april 22 the armed struggle must be 
intensified but in a disciplined way to ensure that the 
government does not backtrack from the path of negotiation 
other problems include anc demands that the economy be 
nationalized to help poor blacks catch up with whites the 
government and white businessmen oppose any plans for 
nationalization or compulsory redistribution of wealth 
white extremists are arming for what they predict will be a race 
war and government officials worry about a violent backlash the 
proapartheid conservative party the main white opposition claims 
it would win an election because most whites oppose de klerks 
plans 
people are arming themselves said andries treurnicht the 
conservative leader they have the right to protect themselves 
gerrit viljoen constitutional development minister 
acknowledged the government wanted quick agreement with the anc to 
avoid a white backlash 
our approach is let us do these things as soon as possible so 
that people can see the heavens have not fallen in he said 
the anc worries about losing support among black militants who 
oppose any settlement with the government young blacks who control 
many of the black townships honor mandela as a leader but some 
reject his moderate line 
more radical black groups have criticized mandela and the anc 
for even negotiating the pan african congress and other militants 
say the only thing to be negotiated is the whites surrender of 
power 
a wave of violence has accompanied the political maneuvering 
most of it fighting between rival black groups police report 574 
deaths in the first three months of 1990 
the independent south african institute for race relations said 
4000 people would be killed this year if violence continued at the 
current rate blackonblack violence in south africa is now 
running at its highest level in modern times the institute said 
mandelas image has been tarnished by his inability to halt the 
violence some political observers see the factional warfare as the 
start of a struggle for power between black groups divided along 
tribal regional and ideological lines

the world jewish congress will hold its first 
conference in germany next week ending with a ceremony at wannsee 
the villa where nazis planned the extermination of european jews 
half a century ago 
mass killing of jews had begun when reinhard heydrich and his 
companions convened in january 1942 at the elegant villa on a lake 
in southwestern berlin to work out details of the final solution 
on may 8 world jewish congress delegates from around the world 
will gather at wannsee to join their sorrow for the 6 million 
jewish victims to presentday concerns 
michel friedman a jewish leader in frankfurt spoke of 
increased antisemitism in the soviet union and what he considers 
related worrisome signs in east germany and poland 
we see in eastern europe that these tendencies recently have 
become much more pronounced than would have been thinkable a few 
years ago said friedman who will attend the wjc conference 
if the past is suppressed then there is an even greater 
danger that things will happen in the present that also must be 
condemned 
the world jewish congress founded in 1936 in response to 
hitlers threats against jews will begin its meeting may 6 in the 
west berlin jewish community building chancellor helmut kohl of 
west germany is to attend the opening 
one of the intentions of this meeting is to give from a moral 
perspective a jewish point of view on the emerging process of 
german unification about which jews have a special concern 
said elan steinberg the wjc executive director about 500 people 
are expected to attend 
the ceremony at wannsee will take place on the 45th anniversary 
of nazi germanys unconditional surrender in world war ii 
west berlins government is renovating the villa and plans to 
open it as a holocaust memorial jan 20 1992 the 50th anniversary 
of the nazi conference 
heydrich a ranking officer of the nazi ss laid out his plans 
to about 15 representatives of police agencies and nazi government 
ministries he said 11 million jews were to be wiped out 
raul hilberg wrote in his book the annihilation of european 
jews that the mood was upbeat due to the freely flowing 
cognac at the twohour meeting 
even before the wannsee conference the nazis had been 
slaughtering jews in poland and the soviet union and deportations 
had begun 
adolf eichmann who was to oversee the deportation and murder of 
millions of jews kept the official record of the wannsee 
proceedings he was hanged in israel in 1962 for crimes against the 
jews 
hitler did not attend the conference and there has been some 
debate of whether he gave direct orders for such a systematic 
slaughter 
as early as january 1939 however he called publicly for the 
annihilation of the jewish race throughout europe hitler 
repeated the call 10 days after the wannsee conference 
he knew about it and wanted it said dieter senoner a 
spokesman for the wannsee villa memorial project theres not the 
slightest doubt about that 
the wannsee villa is between the alsen berlin sailing club and 
the sans souci restaurant in one of berlins most popular excursion 
spots 
many germans stop outside 5658 am grossen wannsee and stare at 
the sprawling beige villa which fell into disrepair over decades 
and now is being renovated 
on a warm april day a young mother stopped with her 10yearold 
daughter and pointed down the driveway to the villa and its 
portico supported by graceful ionic columns 
thats where the national socialists plotted the killings of 
the jews she told the child somberly 
above them was a plaque reading in this house in january 
1942 the infamous wannsee conference took place to the memory of 
the fellow human beings slain by the nazi tyranny

with surprising speed the european 
community has launched a drive for political union with little or 
no idea of the final outcome 
will the 12 separate nations with their various languages and 
cultures eventually merge into a sort of united states of europe 
or will they limit themselves to closer cooperation in foreign 
and security matters 
at the end of a special oneday summit in dublin saturday the 
leaders themselves appeared at odds over what they had agreed to do 
clearly they do not quite know what political union means 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said of her colleagues in 
the trading bloc it astounds me 
european unity was a dream born from the rubble of world war ii 
and led to formation of the european community in 1957 now with 
eastern europe in upheaval western europe feels a compulsion to

in their final statement the leaders said they confirmed their

the new impetus for political closeness came from west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand 
they sent a letter on april 20 to irish prime minister charles 
haughey current ec president urging fellow leaders to 
accelerate the political construction of the europe of the 
twelve 
they said the issue should be discussed at the unscheduled

kohl later said german unity and european integration were two 
sides of the same coin 
to kohl and mitterrand a political merger means strengthening 
the weak strasbougbased european parliament and other agencies 
that now administer the trading bloc they also want the bodies 
more accountable to the public 
and they see unity as requiring a common foreign and security 
policy

kohl and mitterrand broke ranks with the community over lithuania 
the french and west german leaders issued their own statement 
calling on the soviet republic to suspend its march 11 declaration

already ec nationals can travel without passports among member 
countries there are shared arrangements for health care britons 
are buying second homes in france in anticipation of an underwater 
tunnel that will link the countries in three years 
the governments intend to create an economic and monetary union 
which would lead to a common currency and a europeanwide system of 
central banks they will meet in december to change their founding

on saturday they decided they almost certainly will do the same

the opening of the colorful tinroofed caribbean 
marketplace this month in little haiti was good news for an ethnic 
group more often linked to crisis and turmoil in the headlines 
community leaders and residents hope the 10000foot structure 
with gingerbread woodwork and a soaring atrium will be a 
centerpiece of the area and spark a neighborhood economic revival 
although not a large project physically psychologically its 
a huge one said carl craig vice chairman of the haitian task 
force a notforprofit community agency and developer of the 12 
million center 
this is one step for us out of that marketplace a lot of 
other things will start happening this is the turning point 
its effect is already noticeable in this impoverished 
longneglected area of northern miami 
since the marketplace broke ground a year ago plans have been 
announced for several other projects nearby 
we feel in the long run as these projects are developed and 
continued well enhance how the community looks as well as 
create jobs and develop marketable skills said henrirobert 
lamothe task force executive director 
craig hopes the marketplace will finally bring the haitain 
community some publicity that doesnt focus on its problems 
recent stories have focused on alleged abuse at the immigration 
and naturalization service detention camp south of miami that 
houses mostly haitian immigrants on a us food and drug 
administration ban now under review on haitian immigrants giving 
blood as a precaution against spreading aids on continuing 
instability in the haitian government and on the interdiction of 
rickety vessels carrying desperate refugees to florida shores 
the marketplace modeled after the iron market in 
portauprince haiti is painted in bold yellow with accents in a 
rainbow of colors 
six years in the developing it houses vendors selling 
islandoriented goods from clothes to books to tropicalflavored 
ice cream 
nearly all of the 23 stalls which rent for 300 to 675 a 
month are taken most by firsttime business owners helped with 
task force loans and technical assistance 
guy gelin a haitian immigrant who moved to south florida from 
new york in 1981 set up his sunshine arts amp crafts store at the 
marketplace entrance he specializes in selling haitian art here 
while his wife runs an art and flower store in portauprince 
i dont expect a big start gelin said on a recent slow 
weekday afternoon i think it will take at least six months to 
one year for business to be booming but i feel very good about 
prospects for the caribbean marketplace 
christiane joseph who arrived from haiti 10 years ago sells 
fabric from rolls tucked into a back corner of the breezy 
marketplace she says shes happy to be in fulltime sales away 
from the sporadic world of fleamarkets 
the hopes arent restricted to haitians the okonma family who 
emigrated from africa via chicago has opened the liberty fruits amp 
vegetables store 
without them the task force you can do it but it would 
have taken more time and frustration said tony okonma 
most of the business is expected to come from little haitis 
residents but the task force also hopes to attract tourists and 
visitors from other parts of the city 
lamothe says there are few people who can understand what 
haitians are all about and many haitians who do not venture outside 
this enclave so the marketplace could help foster better ethnic 
relations all around 
the marketplace built with funds from numerous sources 
including the city the state and the ford foundation has won 
several design awards 
but one local resident hailed it on opening day april 7 as 
something more 
this place means haitian pride the man who gave his name 
only as boulou told the miami herald when we come to this 
country we have to fight for it but now its standing right here 
in front of us

in one corner theres sen john d 
rockefeller iv heir to one of americas biggest fortunes and 
holding a 21 million pacpacked war chest seeking nomination to 
a second sixyear term 
in the others stand an art professor who refuses to campaign and 
a selfproclaimed inventorlawyer who doesnt do interviews 
jay rockefeller has spent 300000 so far in the race to the may 
8 democratic primary the art professor paul nuchims has spent 
less than 500 
a fourth candidate withdrew saying he couldnt afford to 
challenge rockefeller 
the winner faces republican john yoder 39 a harpers ferry 
lawyer and a onetime aide to former chief justice warren burger in 
november 
yoder has dubbed rockefeller pac man of the year 
but rockefeller claims the money wont sway him 
i think the one really clear thing about jay rockefeller that 
the people of west virginia understand extremely well is that the 
only boss that jay rockefeller has the only accountability he has 
is to the people he said in a recent telephone interview 
rockefeller 52 greatgrandson of standard oil founder john d 
rockefeller and nephew of vice president nelson a rockefeller 
moved to appalachia in 1964 to fight poverty then moved into 
politics a former twoterm west virginia governor he narrowly won 
election to the senate in 1984 
rockefeller cites among his accomplishments in office pushing 
for drug education in schools and enactment of a law requiring us 
automakers to develop vehicles that run on methanol which is made 
partly from coal which is important to west virginians 
as a freshman senator rockefeller generally has voted as a 
liberal opposing the strategic defense initiative and aid to the 
nicaraguan contras but supporting the minimum wage increase and 
60day notice for plant closings 
in west virginia he has been attacked for advocating japanese 
investment in the united states which critics say jeopardizes 
americas independence 
to that he answers when foreign investment from whatever 
source puts west virginians to work then i say it can be good for 
west virginia 
but the biggest complaints about rockefeller since he entered 
state politics have focused on his money his campaigns have earned 
him a name as a freespending scion who buys his way into office 
he spent 9 million in his 1980 gubernatorial run and 12 
million in the 1984 senate race 
this time he has raised 21 million including 800000 from 
political action committees according to campaign financial 
statements 
nuchims 55 of st albans says his biggest donation to date 
was 50 he said hes opposing rockefeller just to get the ideas 
out to the people 
a onetime gubernatorial candidate nuchims has refused to 
campaign choosing instead to exhibit his politically oriented 
artwork 
i do not wish power or glory but somebody has to exude some 
modicum of leadership for the state west virginia is economically 
and leadershipwise bankrupt he said 
chairman of the art department at west virginia state college 
nuchims says he supports a national education policy competency 
testing for teachers and restriction of foreign investment 
the other candidate ken b thompson of morgantown did not 
return numerous telephone calls and has no listed campaign 
headquarters he did however tell one newspaper by mail that he 
is a former us state department aide a lawyer and an inventor 
rockefeller chaired the bipartisan commission on comprehensive 
health care also called the pepper commission which recommended a 
jobsbased universal health insurance plan 
it called for full coverage for everyone within five years and 
said employers would have to provide insurance or contribute to a 
public plan 
but the commission refused to include recommendations on how to 
pay the estimated 23 billion cost

now that the hubble space telescope 
is circling the world to look for secrets of the universe nasa is 
busy with plans to put three other major observatories in orbit 
this decade 
hubble is the flagship of what have become known as the great 
observatories the next to be launched is the gamma ray 
observatory scheduled to head into space aboard the shuttle 
atlantis in november it will investigate matter at extreme 
temperatures and pressure where nuclear synthesis is occurring 
the advanced xray astrophysics facility is due to go up in 
1997 followed by the space infrared telescope facility in 1998 
each observatory will operate far above earths obstructing 
atmosphere and thus provide views of the universe unachievable by 
the best telescope on the highest peak 
the great observatories are moving us into a new order of 
magnitude of the parts of the universe that we can study so were 
almost guaranteed having whole new worlds of study opened up to us 
theyre things we just never could look at before said astronaut 
jeffrey hoffman 
hoffman is one of four astronomers slated to fly aboard the 
shuttle columbia next month with a 100 million observatory called 
astro 
astros four scientific instruments will measure ultraviolet and 
xray radiation during the nineday flight the first spacelab 
mission since 1985 
the most significant thing is that this astro covers a part 
of the spectrum that hubble cant touch said frank six a senior 
scientist at nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
one of its targets will be comet austin believed to be on its 
first trip through the solar system halleys comet would have been 
observed if astro had gone up as planned right after the 1986 
challenger mission that ended in tragedy 
interstellar space dust difficult to see and measure because 
its dark also will be studied by astro astronomers have no idea 
how much there is or how much it contributes to the total mass of 
the universe 
it doesnt sound very romantic to say youre studying dirt 
but thats basically one of the fundamental things were looking 
at cosmic dirt hoffman said 
launch of columbia is targeted for may 16 two weeks later nasa 
plans to launch a delta 2 rocket carrying a german xray 
observatory known as rosat and in august 1991 the agency will 
send up the extreme ultraviolet explorer also on a delta 
the observatories great and small will complement one another 
and help astronomers determine how and when the cosmos came to be 
and whether other stars have planets 
astro for example will provide ultraviolet targets for hubble 
during the telescopes planned 15year lifetime 
astronomers would never survive with just one telescope or one 
sort of telescope there are always new ideas said astronaut 
robert parker an astronomer on the astro mission 
following columbias flight with astro the shuttle launch 
schedule for 1990 is 
july 9 atlantis with a classified defense department payload 
aug 29 columbia with a space life science laboratory for 
biological research 
oct 5 discovery which will unleash the space probe ulysses

thousands of workers and students 
fought running street battles with riot police sunday and a 
dissident labor group called for sympathy strikes to protest a 
police raid on a strikebound shipyard 
in seoul and elsewhere radical students staged violent street 
demonstrations in protest against the raid saturday that crushed a 
threeday strike at the worlds largest shipyard the hyundai heavy 
industries co complex in this port city 200 miles southeast of 
seoul 
police reported some injuries and arrests but gave no overall 
figures 
in ulsan scattered street fighting continued amid a dense fog 
of tear gas near the shipyard throughout sunday as about 3000 
workers staged running battles with riot police 
groups of up to 200 workers attacked police with firebombs 
rocks and other projectiles after grouping in alleyways near the 
shipyard some workers used slingshots to shoot rocks at the 
police who retaliated with tear gas 
down with president roh taewoo workers shouted as they 
raised clenched fists into the air 
at one point about 300 riot police were driven by workers into 
a small factory where they were cut off for more than one hour 
workers blocked the exit by piling broken furniture at the plants 
gate and setting it on fire the police were later rescued by 
colleagues 
angry workers also used firebombs to torch a janitors office at 
a hyundai subsidiary near the shipyard 
some residents believed to be families of shipyard workers 
jeered at police a young woman carrying a baby on her back 
pelted police with several eggs 
a police helicopter flew overhead 
police in ulsan and other industrial regions were put on an 
increased state of alert sunday as a major dissident labor 
federation called for a nationwide general strike tuesday the may 
day workers holiday in support of the hyundai shipyard workers 
the national consultative council of labor unions which claims 
a membership of 180000 issued the strike appeal charging the 
police raid on the shipyard reflected a new government crackdown on 
labor 
the government has vowed to deal firmly with the current wave of 
labor unrest saying the survival of the national economy is at 
stake 
government officials say illegal strikes steep wage increases 
and the rise of the south korean currency the won against the 
dollar have hurt the ability of south koreas exportdriven economy 
to compete overseas 
labor leaders maintain that the government of president roh 
taewoo is more repressive than past authoritarian regimes and has 
unfairly imprisoned more than 200 union activists since taking 
office in 1988 a figure which could not be verified 
the shipyard strike began wednesday when about 20000 workers 
walked off the job demanding that four union leaders jailed in 
earlier protests be released the company maintains judicial 
matters are out of its control 
wage negotiations were scheduled to begin friday but workers 
said wages were not a main issue in the strike 
when about 13000 riot police stormed the ulsan shipyard at dawn 
saturday all but a few hundred of the 2000 striking workers 
inside fled about 150 climbed atop a 240foot crane but their 
number decreased to 50 by sunday reports said 
they hung a huge banner reading lets win collective 
bargaining and achieve our dream of owning houses 
the shipyard the worlds largest with 15 billion in sales 
last year has 24000 workers on its payroll it is a subsidiary of 
the giant hyundai group which produces cars computers steel and 
other goods 
in seoul about 1000 radical students hurling hundreds of 
firebombs attacked police substations and battled riot police on 
sunday scaring holiday shoppers and temporarily paralyzing traffic 
along a main boulevard 
lets crush the roh regime suppressing the labor movement 
students shouted 
riot police fired tear gas but the students regrouped in 
alleyways and charged police repeatedly several students were seen 
being taken away 
other protests took place in the southern cities of kwangju and

no show runs forever says one of the 
dancers in a chorus line after 15 years and 6137 
performances that finally came true for the longest running show 
in broadway history 
the show about dancers auditioning for a big broadway musical 
closed saturday night with a tearful and highly charged performance 
that had theatergoers cheering even before the evening started 
when people entered the shubert theater they were greeted by a 
neon sign showing the number of performances they yelled when the 
house lights went down and every musical number was greeted by 
prolonged applause 
there were bravos for laurie gamache who plays cassie when she 
finished her solo dance number the music and the mirror and 
the audience roared its approval during the entire finale when all 
the dancers dressed in gold costumes high kicked their way 
through one 
when the applause finally stopped producer joseph papp appeared 
for a roll call of the dancers in the current production and most 
of original 1975 cast who also were brought on stage 
this show is dedicated to anyone who has ever danced in a 
chorus or marched in step anywhere papp said take a final bow 
chorus line 
he also lauded the musicals creative team nicholas dante and 
james kirkwood who wrote the book marvin hamlisch who composed 
the music and ed kleban who did the lyrics 
most touching were the tears and applause for michael bennett 
the shows director and choreographer who died of aids in 1987 at 
the age of 44 when a huge black and white photo of bennett 
appeared as a backdrop the audience and cast members clapped 
wildly 
the final performance started nearly a halfhour late as people 
surged in front of the theater in the heart of the broadway theater 
district police closed off part of 44th street to accommodate the 
crowds 
the soldout evening benefited the new york shakespeare 
festival which produced the musical tickets were priced from 80 
to 500 and many were bought by people who had seen the musical 
over and over again 
perhaps the record holders were stephen and betty cockayne of 
nottingham england who caught both the saturday matinee and 
evening performances cockayne has now seen the musical 338 times 
mostly during the shows london run 
fans gathered around the stage door to applaud cast members as 
they left after the performance for a party at mama leones some 
800 guests were invited to the celebration which took over three 
floors at the theater district restaurant 
a chorus line originally was set to close at the end of 
march but papp pushed the final performance back four weeks 
because of a surge in ticket sales 
the show based on some 40 hours of taped conversations by 
dancers started performances in april 1975 at the shakespeare 
festivals newman theater offbroadway it moved to broadway on 
july 25 1975 and has been at the shubert theater ever since 
a chorus line truly is an amazing show says tom porter 
its veteran production stage manager who supervised the musical 
one last time saturday night think how many other shows have 
opened and closed during its 15year run i think thats why it was 
very hard to realize that it was closing after a while you 
thought it will be here forever 
for the dancers the end came gradually over the last week most 
already had cleaned out their dressing rooms before the final 
curtain 
and the shubert already has a new tenant the theater will 
undergo extensive renovation and reopen in october with buddy 
the hit london musical about the legendary american rock n roll 
singer buddy holly

an exiled white south african priest 
known as a african national congress activist was critically 
wounded in a letter bomb explosion at his harare home church 
officials said sunday 
the anglican rev michael lapsley lost both hands and an eye in 
the explosion late saturday and underwent emergency surgery in the 
main harare hospital said a church spokesman who asked not to be 
identified 
the zimbabwe government confirmed lapsley had been badly 
injured in the blast which authorities were investigating home 
affairs minister moven mahachi declined to give further details 
and police refused to comment 
the attack comes just four days before the scheduled start of 
talks in south africa between an anc delegation headed by nelson 
mandela and president fw de klerk aimed at removing obstacles to 
constitutional negotiations on granting political rights to the 
countrys black majority 
the rev desmond tutu south africas anglican archbishop 
condemned the letter bombing 
i hope this cruel bombing is not what we suspect it to be an 
attempt by rightwing elements possibly with contacts in the 
security forces to sabotage the negotiating process tutu said 
in a statement released by his cape town office 
lapsley evidently opened the letter bomb at his rented house in 
downtown harare the zimbabwean capital and there were unconfirmed 
reports a second person was injured in the explosion 
the blast ripped through the living room collapsing the ceiling 
and shattering most of the windows of the house 
the church spokesman described lapsley as an active anc member 
who was said to have been on a south african hit list of exiled 
opponents 
we are assuming south africa is involved he said 
the list named activists at home and abroad said to be the 
targets of south african military and security police death squads 
now under judicial investigation in south africa 
the church spokesman said lapsley had received death threats in 
the past from white south african extremists and was under police 
protection in harare for the past three years 
there was no immediate reaction from south african authorities 
lapsley a new zealand native in his early 40s was expelled 
from south africa in the late 1970s because of his activities 
against the apartheid system of racial separation 
he settled in zimbabwe and frequently traveled to the ancs 
exile headquarters in lusaka in neighboring zambia 
associates said lapsley officiated at the funerals of several 
anc sympathizers killed in bombing and sabotage attacks on the 
guerrilla organizations facilities in blackgoverned nations 
neighboring south africa 
the last bombing in zimbabwe occurred in january 1988 when one 
man died in a car bomb blast outside a house occupied by anc exiles 
in the city of bulawayo 
saturdays attack is the first bombing directed at exiled anc 
members since the organization was legalized in south africa as 
part of political reforms announced feb 2 by de klerk 
many exiled anc activists announced plans to return to south 
africa following de klerks announcement 
the zimbabwebased churchrun liberation support committee said 
the bombing demonstrated what it described as the violence that 
is an integral part of apartheid 
despite the attempts of the south african regime to portray 
itself as goodwilled it is in events such as this attack that 
it shows its true colors the statement said

president bush reacted guardedly sunday to 
reports from lebanon that kidnappers soon would free another 
american hostage saying only thats wonderful if it proves 
true 
news of the kidnappers terse statement promising freedom within 
48 hours for educator frank h reed reached bush as he finished a 
rainy outing on a military golf course outside washington 
to reporters who asked about the news as the president walked 
off the 18th green at the andrews air force base course bush said 
ive learned not to speculate on the hostages for the reasons i 
keep explaining i just wont say anything if that proves to be 
true thats wonderful 
a white house deputy spokesman john herrick said later we 
have no independent confirmation of these reports at this time 
herrick said bush had received an update from the white house 
situation room on the reports of a possible hostage release 
the kidnappers in an unsigned statement released in beirut 
said reed will carry a message addressed to the american 
administration when he is set free 
earlier sunday sen david boren dokla chairman of the 
senate intelligence committee said he is very optimistic that 
were going to see more hostages released 
another us hostage robert polhill 55 was freed april 22 
after 39 months in captivity 
a state department spokesman david denny said were 
hopeful weve seen the report we continue to press for 
release of all the hostages 
reed 57 director of the lebanese international school was 
kidnapped in west beirut on sept 12 1986 by a previously unknown 
group calling itself the arab revolutionary cellsomar mukhtar 
brigade 
the massachusetts native had lived in beirut for eight years 
his second wife is a syrian moslem and reed himself is a convert to 
islam 
reed is among seven americans and 17 westerners still held 
hostage in lebanon joseph james cicippio an administrator of the 
american university of beirut was kidnapped on the same day as 
reed 
only two hostages have been held longer terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press a prisoner 
since march 16 1985 and thomas sutherland dean of agriculture at 
the american university of beirut whose ordeal began on june 9 
1985 
polhill railthin after his threeplus years in captivity has 
been recuperating at walter reed army medical center in washington 
after being evacuated from beirut to syria to west germany and on 
the united states 
boren interviewed on nbctvs meet the press said economic 
pressures on iran and syria including reduced soviet aid to 
damascus was causing him to believe the two countries will 
pressure the kidnappers to free their hostages 
both syria and iran need a flow of outside investment and 
they know that will never happen until they release our hostages 
boren said i think that kind of pressure will continue if well 
just be patient 
bush thanked both syria and iran for help they rendered in 
securing polhills release but said last week this is mission 
uncompleted i do not have forgiveness in my heart as long as 
one american is held against his will 
bush ruled out any immediate overture to iran saying im not 
making gestures i dont trade for hostages

lots of people were on the streets of a 
italianamerican enclave when a mob of neighborhood youths stalked 
surrounded and killed a black teenager who ventured into their 
section to check out a used car 
but while prosecutors have trotted some three dozen people to 
the stand to testify against two alleged members of the gang only 
one person who took the stand said he was an eyewitness and he has 
a history of hallucinations 
to be sure the district attorneys menagerie of witnesses was 
quite extraordinary two jailed con artists who say the accused 
triggerman confessed to them a young woman portrayed as being at 
the crimes vortex and a young man who said he didnt bother to 
look when someone opened fire only a few feet from him 
only franklin tighe recalled seeing the incident he testified 
that defendant joseph fama pulled a shiny silver metal handgun 
four shots were fired toward the black youth 
tighe said he watched last aug 23 as 16yearold yusuf hawkins 
fell mortally wounded to the sidewalk and the white mob ran 
famas defense lawyer david depetris maintains tighe was 
hallucinating the 20yearold told doctors a few years ago he was 
being controlled by helicopters hovering over the neighborhood 
fama and fellow defendant keith mondello both 19 are on trial 
in brooklyn state supreme court for two counts of murder each and 
other crimes in the attack which law enforcers characterize as 
racially motivated 
six other young bensonhurst residents will be tried later 
prosecutors are convinced from admissions by participants in the 
attack and from statements by neighbors who watched that there are 
many witnesses who could name names and say exactly what happened 
when hawkins and his three black friends were attacked 
throughout the trial prosecutors have been frustrated by what 
assistant district attorney edward boyar termed the hear no evil 
see no evil speak no evil ethic of the closeknit brooklyn 
enclave 
christopher lomuto a 10thgrader whos lived most of his life 
in bensonhurst announced the murder to much of the neighborhood 
running down the street yelling someones been shot several 
witnesses testified 
on the stand lomuto admitted he had seen many of the events of 
that night but he defiantly told boyar i didnt see anybodys 
face it was dark out 
carmen mercado a longtime bensonhurst resident said that on 
the day before the incident she had sent her 14yearold daughter 
out of the neighborhood because shed heard rumors of trouble 
about 10 days after the killing ms mercado told police what 
she saw a few days later boyar said she began receiving 
threatening phone calls in the middle of the night when she took 
the witness stand tuesday she could recall few details for the 
jury 
one bensonhurst boy said he was a few feet away from hawkins 
when the shooting started but testified he didnt turn around to 
see who had the gun 
but the prosecutions star witness was gina feliciano whose 
name has been at the center of the murder case since the beginning 
sometimes crying other times snarling miss feliciano testified 
about hawkins killing on the night of her 18th birthday party 
on the previous day she said mondello had told her i should 
spit in your face you nigger lover 
mondellos lawyer stephen murphy whos fashioned much of his 
defense around a personal attack on her called miss feliciano who 
has had a drug problem since age 13 a crackhead and a 
contemptible liar 
he blames miss feliciano for the killing saying she stirred up 
trouble by telling mondello that 25 of her black friends were 
coming to bensonhurst on her birthday to beat him up 
the white mob murphy says mistook hawkins and his friends for 
the expected interlopers 
murphy was scheduled to open his defense of mondello on monday 
with the fama defense to follow on tuesday the trial judge 
justice thaddeus owens said he expects to give the case to jurors 
may 7

there are many similarities between 
two mail bombs that exploded in a texas church in january and at 
christian broadcasting network in virginia last week a federal 
official said sunday 
but paul lyon senior agent for the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms in north carolina hesitated to say the two mail bombs 
are connected 
we see both incidents as i dont want to use the word 
connected lets just say there are sufficicent similarities in 
both situations that have caused us to concentrate our 
investigation in the fayettevillebladen county area lyon said 
in a telephone interview from his home in charlotte 
both bombs were sent from bladen county lyon and richard metz 
senior postal inspector for north carolina and south carolina said 
saturday 
lyon said federal officials did not want to get into any any 
specifics or details about the devices themselves or any 
commonalities 
sources told the fayetteville observertimes that both packages 
had fayetteville return addresses metz declined to reveal the 
addresses but said they were in the fayetteville area 
the first bomb exploded in the 10000member interdominational 
lakewood church in northeast houston in late january one person 
was injured 
lyon said an investigation has found that the package bomb was 
mailed from the elizabethtown post office in bladen county on jan 
26 
on friday a bomb in a package addressed to the rev pat 
robertson at the christian broadcasting co in virginia beach va 
exploded in the mailroom when it was opened by a security guard 
the guard was hospitalized with shrapnel wounds in one leg 
metz said that package was mailed from the bladenboro post 
office on april 20 
metz and lyon said their offices had been in contact with 
cumberland county sheriff morris bedsole since friday because of 
the connection with the bombings and because of services conducted 
by television evangelist jimmy swaggart on friday and saturday at 
the cumberland county civic auditorium 
bedsole said security around the evangelist was increased after 
the news of the virginia beach bombing no problems were reported 
a 50000 reward has been offered in the houston bombing there 
will be an additional reward in connection with the virginia beach 
bombing metz said 
lyon said he does not believe either bomb is connected with any 
other mail bombs

one hundred and fifty mailorder cowboys 
got to live out their fantasies about life in the old west as they 
headed em up and moved em out on a longhorn cattle drive at the 
yo ranch 
the participants had all purchased places on saturdays drive 
through the 1989 neiman marcus christmas catalog known for its 
unusual and expensive offerings 
i feel like a little kid living cheyenne like any minute 
james arness or clint walker is going to come riding up the hill 
im having a ball said peggy weitzmann of englewood nj 
its kind of like a time warp its like stepping into 
americas past said margie crane a housewife from charlotte 
nc 
well actually there were a few modern intrusions like the 
portable toilets along the cattle trail 
doctors psychologists college professors and businessmen from 
25 states and canada were among those who paid 627 to 767 each 
for the magazines offer to saddle up and ride into history 
the 150 slots available for the roundup sold out in two hours said 
pat zajac of neiman marcus 
the roundup marked the 110th anniversary of the 40000acre yo 
ranch where more than 1000 longhorns roam 
early saturday the greenhorns swaggered out to the corral many 
of them wearing new leather chaps cowboy hats and dusters 
but some seemed to hesitate when it came time to actually get on 
a horse 
is it anything like riding a dirt bike asked wade moody of 
fort worth 
ive already signed up for my massage said marky liston of 
new york city 
gaylon young an insurance salesman from arlington was one of 
about a dozen who ate dirt instead of staying in the saddle 
i jumped off and swapped horses young said 
one woman got a slight concussion when she toppled backwards 
and her horse landed on top of her but like everyone else who took 
tumbles she got back in the saddle later in the day 
in all 400 riders and ranch hands two covered wagons and a 
stage coach finally hit the trail driving about 75 longhorns 
steers that ranch hands said they had been gentling down all 
week 
the drive was led by kenny house a 74yearold deputy us 
marshal from dodge city kan where the western trail the cattle 
trail that started at the yo ended in the old days 
most of the wouldbe cowboys looked fairly authentic except for 
a few with designer purses looped over their saddle horns some 
said they were used to riding polo ponies or hunted at home 
despite a few mishaps and complaints that cowboys outnumbered 
cows 6to1 almost everyone said they were satisfied 
i think the old west might have been a little different from 
this but its fun said carolyn simon of augusta ga 
stephen henson an ear nose and throat doctor from lafayette 
ind said the chance to fulfill his lifelong dream to be a 
cowboy made him yearn to punch cattle fulltime although the 
technological age intruded in his wishes 
im going to turn in my resignation when i get home i might 
even fax it if theyve got one back at the ranch he said

the slaughter of wild burros in the 
foothills of the black mountains has revived the controversy over 
their place in the delicate desert environment 
one or more sharpshooters killed 51 of the animals recently 
about onethird of a herd in a remote area 15 miles southwest of 
here in northwestern arizona their bodies were found during the 
week of april 1620 
investigators said most were killed by a shot to the head with 
smallcaliber rifles fired from 100 to 300 yards away 
it was done by a professional there is no doubt said karen 
sussman president of the international society for the protection 
of mustangs and burros the shooting was indiscriminate they 
shot mares about to give birth young foals adult burros all of 
them 
her organization is offering 5000 for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of the killers 
burros are not native to north america but are descended from 
pack animals abandoned or lost by miners critics say they compete 
with both native species and livestock for space water and food 
wildlife advocates have criticized their effects on endangered 
species such as the desert tortoise 
until 1971 feral burros and horses were routinely killed by 
ranchers and hunters then a public outcry resulted in the wild and 
freeroaming horses and burros act 
they were declared living symbols of the historic and pioneer 
spirit of the west and placed under federal protection penalties 
for killing them range as high as a 2000 fine and a year in jail 
per burro killed 
ranchers perspectives on the issue were illustrated by a letter 
which the mohave daily miner published friday from jennifer 
chambers 
i do not condone the recent method of elimination of the 
burro but i can understand the reasoning behind the action she 
wrote 
burros can be mean kicking and biting and are also very 
destructive especially with water sources which in this area are 
vital to the lives of wild animals in the desert burros will 
trample a water hole into a muddy mess and to put it politely 
relieve themselves thus rendering the water unfit to drink 
ms chambers suggested that the environmentalists arrange with 
the us bureau of land management to set aside tracts of land for 
burros 
ms sussman and her group could pay to feed the burros and 
arrange adoptions and save taxpayer funds added ms chambers 
who did not return calls seeking further comment 
a motive for the killings was unclear 
there has been controversy some threats against the burros 
from different interests up in that area said anna maria adamo 
a blm spokeswoman in phoenix 
but we have carefully controlled the burro herds in this area 
so there would be no conflict with wildlife and there is no cattle 
grazing at all in that area now so we have no cause to think the 
problem is rancherrelated she added 
officials have estimated there were about 150 burros in the 
immediate area of the killings and an additional 450 in the black 
mountains some hang around the old mining town of oatman where 
tourists feed them 
sources said the carcasses were scattered over an 
eightsquaremile area of almost inaccessible terrain 
given that this area was so remote and that such a large 
number of animals was killed whoever went out there really was 
determined to decimate the herd ms adamo said 
this was not just someone off on a lark sport killing ms 
adamo added you know i cant find a rabbit to shoot so ill 
shoot a burro this was someone who put a great deal of effort 
into getting those animals

and backed off from arresting a mohawk indian after he pointed a 
gun at them and another mohawk fired a shot into the air 
authorities said sunday 
the troopers were more than justified to return fire at these 
people and they didnt said state police lt michael klusacek 
but a mohawk spokesman disputed the account he said the police 
had fired at the indians who had not fired at all 
at about 830 pm saturday troopers pulled over a pickup truck 
driven by a mohawk wanted with 15 others for blocking an 
investigation into last months shooting of a military helicopter 
over the ganienkeh territory near the canadian border 
the mohawk pointed a shotgun at the troopers and turned to run 
said state police maj robert leu a second mohawk standing on a 
nearby hill fired one shot into the air from an ak47 assault 
rifle leu said 
both indians then fled into the woods which lead into the 
ganienkeh territory police said 
one of the most creditable things for our people is that they 
chose not to take a life klusacek said the result may be 
different next time everybody realizes we dont want to start 
a war because of a reckless act by an individual who probably 
doesnt really understand what he was doing 
but ganienkeh spokesman darryl martin said they shot at us 
its a fact the police are saying that our people fired on them 
and they are lying they are lying through their teeth 
the ganienkeh territory was quiet sunday roadblocks set up by 
troopers and indians were removed by 1245 am klusacek said 
tensions have been high there since march 30 when a vermont 
national guard helicopter made an emergency landing in ganienkeh 
after it was struck by three gunshots a civilian doctor aboard the 
helicopter was hurt 
the indians deny the shots came from their land an armed 
standoff lasted 11 days before state and federal investigators were 
allowed onto the territory which the indians claim is sovereign 
land 
federal obstruction of justice charges later were filed against 
the 16 mohawks who failed to turn themselves in by a wednesday 
deadline set by the us attorney in albany 
police said they dont plan to go into the territory after the 
suspects 
we have warrants for them and wherever we see them we will 
arrest them klusacek said as to whether well try to storm 
the reserve i would say thats a remote possibility 
separately state police warned gamblers to stay away saturday 
night as one indian casino reopened for the first time since 
gambling opponents blockaded the strifetorn st regis mohawk 
reservation which straddles the uscanada border 
its 14000 residents are divided over casinos and bingo halls on 
the us side 
the feud also touches on the question of whether state and 
federal officials have authority to intervene in a dispute among 
indians

the posters in an area where the 
homeless usually gather advertised free food anytime of day or 
night peoples soup kitchen and displayed a pedestrian map 
showing the best route 
but several hungry people were disappointed when they followed 
the path 
it led to the home of mayor loni hancock who called the hoax a 
heartless meanspirited joke after about a dozen people 
knocked on her door starting at 630 am saturday 
we felt sorry for them she said they genuinely needed 
food and shelter but we only had a few little things in the house 
we gave them some bananas and oranges 
police who have no suspects in the prank said about 40 slick 
posters appeared on telephone poles mailboxes and store windows 
along telegraph avenue and at peoples park where many of the 
citys homeless congregate 
hancocks husband state assemblyman tom bates tore down about 
40 fliers early saturday 
most of the people who came felt angry abused and humiliated 
and that angered me said hancock who last month assembled 
mayors from throughout the san francisco bay area to help 
coordinate homeless services

dave stevens has an acute eye for art 
he also has great acuity of vision 2017 to be exact which 
enables him to paint tiny portraits on grains of rice watch faces 
and the heads of pins 
his miniature portrait of st louis cardinal shortstop ozzie 
smith on a grain of rice is enshrined in the st louis baseball 
hall of fame 
now his attention has turned to bigger things portraits of 
cardinals manager whitey herzog on baseballs 
herzog has a banquet coming up at the end of may i have to do 
seven dozen portraits in seven weeks he said dipping a tiny 
brush into a palette 
the alton artist painted 100 baseballs with herzogs likeness 
for the manager last year herzog auctioned them off to benefit the 
ymca 
a baseball card serves as stevens inspiration and he creates 
his art on a tv tray in his living room it takes stevens about one 
hour to paint herzogs portrait on the back of a regulation 
baseball 
i do it over and over so theyre not identical but i want 
them as close as possible he says 
stevens collects 25 per portrait not including the cost of the 
ball 
he doesnt limit his subjects to baseball players or baseballs 
his favorite effort a grinning mickey mouse on the head of a 
straight pin 
ive done portraits on old lockets and inside pocket watch 
covers he said once i took the crystal out and painted a 
player in the batting stance on the face of a watch i made the bat 
on the big hand and the ball with all the stitchings on the end of 
the small hand he said 
stevens smallest painting is a skull and crossbones on the tip 
of a paper clip for a motorcycle rider 
i read the smallest painting in the world is on the head of a 
pin so i used the paper clip the wire tip is as small as a shaft 
of the pin the artist said 
most of his ideas come from customers who want for example a 
portrait of an anniversary couple on rice or a color drawing of a 
favorite car encased on a belt buckle stevens said 
stevens began creating miniature art six years ago out of 
boredom 
it was one of those weekends in august when nothing was on tv 
and i had been asleep on the couch he said i painted a scene 
on a stone the size of a quarter and it snowballed after that

china on sunday accused taiwan of trying to 
foment unrest on the mainland by promising to help prodemocracy 
activists who intend to broadcast messages from a ship off the 
chinese coast 
the 1200ton vessel backed by the parisbased chinese 
dissident group the federation for a democratic china set sail 
from france on march 17 its crew plans to begin broadcasting 
music news and prodemocracy reports to the mainland in early may 
taiwan communications minister chang chiehpan said on april 20 
that the ship would be allowed to dock at keelung north of the 
capital of taipei and that the military would protect the ship if 
it came under attack while in taiwan waters the ship dubbed the 
goddess of democracy is expected to arrive in the next few 
days 
chinas official xinhua news agency said sunday that taiwans 
support of the ship is a new step to oppose the chinese 
government and to create disturbances on the chinese mainland 
chinas foreign ministry has stated china cannot tolerate 
support for the radio ship the government has not ruled out the 
use of force to stop the broadcasts 
taiwan authorities meddled in many ways in last years 
antigovernment rebellion in beijing xinhua said sunday 
referring to the prodemocracy movement crushed by military force 
in june 
now it said taiwan authorities are intensifying their 
efforts by organizing those fugitives to conduct subversive 
propaganda along the coast of the chinese mainland this 
constitutes an open provocation 
it said taiwans leaders talk glibly about wanting to ease 
relations between both sides of the taiwan strait but do just the 
opposite 
the agency also said the international telecommunications union 
in response to a complaint from china had confirmed that 
unauthorized broadcasting from a ship on the high seas is illegal 
taiwan and china have been bitter enemies since nationalists 
lost a civil war to the communists who took over the mainland in 
1949 
however trade and other unofficial contacts between the two 
nations have grown steadily over the past few years and hundreds 
of thousands of taiwan residents visited the mainland since their 
government lifted a ban on such visits in 1987

the soviet army newspaper disclosed for the first 
time sunday that when the russians downed a us spy plane 30 years 
ago they also destroyed one of their own fighters that was pursuing 
the american u2 
the u2 piloted by francis gary powers was shot down on may 1 
1960 disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in paris between 
president dwight d eisenhower and soviet leader nikita s 
khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned 
for later that year 
red star the soviet army newspaper said the soviets lost a 
mig19 and its pilot in the operation 
the paper also disclosed for the first time that the soviets 
sent up a new fighter plane and ordered its pilot to ram the u2 in 
a suicide mission the new fighter reached the u2s altitude but 
failed to ram it 
the article published three days before this years may day 
festivities may have been intended to remind soviet readers that 
us actions have damaged superpower ties in the past in recent 
days soviet officials have warned relations might suffer if 
washington imposes sanctions on moscow in retaliation for its 
crackdown on the baltic republic of lithuania 
red star said that khrushchev was atop lenins mausoleum on red 
square watching the may day parade when he learned that a new model 
soviet sa2 surfacetoair missile had brought down the u2 
the commander of the soviet air defense forces marshal sergei 
biryuzov climbed the mausoleum carrying happy news that the 
plane had been hit by the first rocket the article said and 
khrushchev standing right there on the tribune congratulated the 
marshal 
khrushchev in memoirs smuggled to the west and published in 
1974 wrote that diplomats watching the parade knew something big 
had happened because biryuzov wore a duty uniform rather than the 
parade dress worn by the other military officers in red square 
soviets hurrying to the may day parade in the ural mountain city 
of sverdlovsk saw a far different sight what appeared to be 
fireworks high in the air said the article signed by a col a 
dokuchayev 
the fiery debris was not fireworks but a soviet mig19 that was 
hit by the same type of missile that exploded behind powers u2 
and damaged it red star said in the most detailed version of the 
soviet military action 
powers mission began in pakistan and was to have carried him 
over sverdlovsk for a landing in norway 
he used neither the automatic destruction device nor a poison 
pin he had been given in case the mission failed and he was 
captured at a collective farm near sverdlovsk he was held for 
three years then exchanged for the soviet spy rudolph abel powers 
published his memoirs in 1970 
the soviet article disclosed for the first time that the soviets 
had ordered a new model sukhoi9 fighter to pursue the u2 in an 
unsuccessful ramming attempt the su9 was unarmed but was able 
reach nearly to the 70000 feet at which the u2 operated the 
report said 
the soviets also scrambled two mig19s which were not capable 
of flying that high the pilot of one mig19 boris ivazyan 
reported to ground control that the debris from the u2 was 
actually that from an sa2 that had missed the u2 prompting the 
ground battery to fire another 
the next soviet missile struck the mig19 flown by sergei 
safronov 30 who was killed he was one of 21 soviets given medals 
for their role in bringing down powers and the red star article 
disclosed for the first time that he was honored posthumously 
ivazyan survived and later married safronovs widow 
us accounts say that the decision to send powers was 
controversial within the eisenhower administration the soviets had 
failed to shoot down a u2 over the same area april 9 and some 
within the administration feared sending another mission could 
jeopardize ussoviet relations 
the u2 incident ended a thaw in ussoviet relations and was 
followed by some of the worst moments of the cold war the bay of 
pigs landing of usbacked forces in cuba in january 1961 the 
construction of the berlin wall in 1961 and the cuban missile 
crisis in october 1962 
american author james oberg in his book uncovering soviet 
disasters wrote that two unanswered questions of the u2 
incident were why a us spy plane penetrated so deeply into 
russia and why the soviets had based their latest antiaircraft 
missile 1000 miles within their own borders protecting sverdlovsk 
the soviet article shed no light on those mysteries it said 
only that the u2 carried photographic equipment intended for use 
over sverdlovsk which is closed to westerners because it houses 
major defense industries 
military goods produced in the sverdlovsk region according to 
material available in the west include heavy machinery chemical 
weapons and nuclear weapons components

ersin kokkozov had never heard of drawing 
interest in a private bank but the soviet scientist was so 
thrilled with the concept he opened his own account 
crescent bank officials didnt know if kokkozov fulfilled his 
wish to be the first soviet citizen to open a us bank account 
but he certainly was the first in this small north georgia town 
ive got 10 so ill be the first kokkozov said during a 
tour of the bank with participants in an exchange program with the 
soviets ill just be like a symbol my money is here in trust 
it took an interpreters help and some effort to make the bank 
computer accept an address in almaata kazakhstan but kokkozov 
soon had a checkbook and a set of complimentary coffee mugs 
kokkozov the general manager of a soviet research firm said he 
cant wait until his next trip to the united states to see how much 
interest hes earned 
how long do you have to leave it here the budding 
capitalist asked 
in the soviet union only government banks exist and people 
dont deal in checks and credit cards workers are paid in cash 
so when bank tellers demonstrated the automatic teller machine 
the soviets gasped in amazement 
only in america exclaimed leila namuradze 
another visitor valeri kadzanaya drew out his business card 
and asked if it too could make transactions 
the 15 soviets were part of almost 300 people mostly soviet 
georgians participating in the ussoviet exchange about 260 
us georgians are now traveling in the soviet georgian capital of 
tbilisi

prime minister yitzhak shamir pledged on sunday 
to continue israels settlement drive in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip despite us objections 
shamir also said progress towards peace negotiations do not 
depend on agreeing to us terms for palestinianisraeli peace 
talks 
in a nationally broadcast interview on israels 42nd anniversary 
of independence shamir said he wished the jewish settlement effort 
could be more extensive 
you cannot speak today of a massive settlement drive i wish 
we could to my sorrow in view of the task facing us we would 
not be able to deal in the next year or two with a massive 
settlement drive shamir said 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc referred to the vast 
influx of soviet emigres one of israels most pressing problems 
but some development some progress always has to take place 
we must not stand in one place i think this government would not 
accept any obligation not to do something in this area of 
settlement and development he said 
shamir said he cannot ignore the objections of the us 
administration which views settlements in the occupied lands as an 
obstacle to peace 
israelus relations have been strained by shamirs refusal to 
accept us secretary of state james a baker iiis proposals for 
peace talks and by recent settlement activity in east jerusalem 
the west bank and gaza strip 
israel seized those areas during the 1967 middle east war and 
has been trying to quell a 28monthold palestinian uprising in the 
territories 
i have to say that there is something perhaps ridiculous in 
the slogan of yes to baker shamir said in an israel radio 
interview 
but if theres understanding and cooperation with the united 
states well then no one can expect us to accept every proposal and 
every idea of the american secretary be what they may be he 
said 
israels governing likudlabor coalition fell apart march 15 
after shamir refused to endorse the baker proposals supported by 
shimon peres leader or the centerleft labor party shamir is 
caretaker prime minister and is trying to form a new government 
the baker program provides a framework for starting a dialogue 
on israels proposal to hold elections to choose representatives to 
negotiate an interim autonomy plan for 17 million palestinians in 
the west bank and gaza strip 
about 75000 jewish settlers live in the occupied territories 
the leftist daily al hamishmar reported that a shamir settlement 
aide michael dekel is preparing plans for the speedy construction 
of two other settlements in the west bank it said the settlements 
have yet to be approved by the government 
since shamir became head of the caretaker government jewish 
settlers began construction at dugit in the gaza strip and at alon 
in the west bank 
in addition about 150 settlers also took over a building owned 
by the greek orthodox church in the christian quarter of 
jerusalems old walled city but a court ordered them to leave

a group calling itself the organization 
of islamic dawn announced sunday it will free american hostage 
frank reed within 48 hours and said he will carry a message for the 
us government 
in iran a newspaper quoted an iranian official as also saying 
reeds release was expected by tuesday night after extensive 
talks between the kidnappers and iran 
the announcement from the previously unknown islamic dawn group 
was delivered to the independent beirut newspaper annahar three 
hours after an earlier unsigned communique said the us educator 
held for more than 3 years will be freed by tuesday 
the later statement was accompanied by a blackandwhite picture 
of a bearded smiling reed to prove its authenticity it claimed 
responsibility for the earlier statement sent with two other 
pictures to the independent newspaper and a western news agency 
the communiques were released one week after a proiranian 
shiite moslem group freed american hostage robert polhill polhill 
the first american hostage to have been freed since november 1986 
was released with the help of syria 
reed 57 of malden mass is married to a syrian moslem woman 
both statements were typewritten in arabic the later one 
contained a denial of news reports that the first communique 
promising reeds release was signed by the organization of arab 
revolutionary cellsomar moukhtar brigade a shadowy group that had 
initially claimed reeds abduction on sept 9 1986 
the statements which did not say what the message to washington 
would contain left president bush and reeds relatives hopeful but 
cautious 
i just wont say anything bush said while golfing at 
andrews air force base outside washington if that proves to be 
true thats wonderful 
leota sprague reeds 91yearold mother said she has to keep 
faith 
its an awful thrust in your side when you find out these 
things arent true she said from her home in malden mass 
bob langston reeds soninlaw said from his malden home 
were feeling cautious it would be wonderful if this really 
happened but there have been so many false alarms with the other 
hostages 
in iran the tehran times quoted the unidentified iranian 
official as saying extensive talks were going on between the 
kidnappers and iran and a release was expected by tuesday night 
the englishlanguage newspaper considered close to iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani said in its monday edition that iran 
asked the kidnappers to free another captive 
the statements in beirut were accompanied by the first two 
photographs of reed to be released since he was kidnapped and 
contained the first news of reed since his abduction 
the first communique was delivered around 630 pm 1230 pm 
edt meaning that reed would presumably be released by that time 
on tuesday 
the statement said 
in the name of god the merciful the compassionate 
we have decided to free american hostage frank reed within 48 
hours he will carry a message addressed to the american 
administration 
annahar also received a color photograph of reed in which he 
appeared neatly combed and clean shaven and wore a blueandwhite 
striped shirt 
the western news agency received a blackandwhite photo of 
reed showing him with a bushy grey beard he wore a dark tshirt 
and looked straight into the camera with slightly hunched 
shoulders people who knew reed said he never wore a beard while 
living in beirut before the kidnapping indicating the 
blackandwhite photo was probably taken of him in captivity 
the later communique repeated the first message claimed 
responsibility for the kidnapping and warned news media not to say 
he was being held by others 
the name given for the group the islamic dawn suggests the 
kidnappers are proiranian shiite moslem zealots like those holding 
most of the 17 westerners missing in lebanon 
reed director of the lebanese international school was 
kidnapped near beirut airport gunmen in a dark blue volvo 
intercepted his car and seized him and the driver who later was 
released 
a previously unknown group calling itself the arab 
revolutionary cells omar mukhtar brigade claimed responsibility 
for reeds abduction in a statement released to beirut newspapers 
five days after his abduction 
there was no authentication of that statement and kidnappers 
released no word on him until sunday 
reed is one of 17 western hostages including seven americans 
held in lebanon the longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
earlier sunday sen david boren dokla chairman of the 
senate intelligence committee said he was very optimistic that 
were going to see more hostages released 
interviewed on nbcs meet the press show in washington 
boren said the reasons for that optimism include economic problems 
in iran and syria including a reduction in soviet aid to damascus 
reed had lived in beirut since late 1977 he had converted to 
islam to marry his second wife fahima a syrian moslem he has two 
children jacqueline and marilyn from his first marriage 
former french hostage jeanpaul kauffmann said after his release 
on may 4 1988 that he had seen reed among hostages held by the 
proiranian shiite moslem islamic jihad or islamic holy war 
islamic jihad holds anderson 42 of lorain ohio and thomas 
sutherland 58 of fort collins colo 
sutherland who was acting dean of agriculture at the american 
university of beirut was kidnapped june 9 1985

finnish communists have voted to 
disband the countrys 72yearold communist party and form a new 
leftwing coalition in an effort to revive the declining socialist 
movement officials said sunday 
the move comes after a decade in which political support for 
farleft parties has steadily declined they now hold only 20 seats 
in the 200member parliament compared with 35 in 1979 
at a twoday meeting that ended sunday more than 4000 
communist and other leftwing delegates voted to dissolve the 
communist party as well as its umbrella organization the peoples 
democratic league and the breakaway democratic alternative faction 
in their place the delegates formed a new organization known as 
the leftwing union 
claes andersson a leftwing member of parliament who was 
elected chairman of the leftwing union predicted that the 
traditional rivalries that have traditionally split the finnish 
communist movement would disappear 
the meeting was a very successful one there was a good 
feeling and none of the old conflicts andersson said in a radio 
interview at the end of the meeting 
the finnish communist party founded in moscow in 1918 was 
forced to operate underground in finland until the end of world war 
ii when finland signed a cooperation agreement with the soviet 
union 
in the 1960s the communist movement suffered a deep split 
between a moderate majority faction and a hardline minority 
the split gave birth to other breakaway movements and caused the 
communists to lose influence on national politics 
neutral finland is now governed by a coalition of the 
conservatives social democrats and two small nonsocialist parties

music replaced mourning sirens sunday night as 
israelis ended memorial ceremonies honoring war dead and began 
celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the jewish states independence 
joy and sorrow are intertwined in our national holiday just as 
the balance of light and shadow in the life of our nation 
president chaim herzog said in an address to the nation 
throughout the country israelis took to the streets dancing to 
rock and disco music children engaged in a favorite independence 
day pastime hitting passersby with small plastic hammers that 
produce a clicking noise 
police estimated nearly 1 million israelis nearly onefourth 
of the countrys population would go on picnics and hikes on 
monday when the sundowntosundown holiday continues independence 
day festivities however were held mainly on sunday night 
in an independence day message released by his office herzog 
said the main challenge facing israel in the coming year was 
absorbing 100000 soviet immigrants expected to arrive this year 
this is the most important challenge on the list of national 
priorities he said jewish history will not forgive us if we 
fail to see the greatness of the hour 
arab states have lobbied the soviet union to halt the 
immigration fearing it will strengthen the jewish state and that 
some of the immigrants may be settled in the occupied west bank or 
gaza strip 
before independence day began israelis lit memorial flames and 
visited gravesites at military cemeteries across the country as 
part of memorial day 
in somber wreathlaying ceremonies at army cemeteries mourners 
lit flames and recited the kaddish a prayer for the dead 
remembering the 16951 soldiers killed in israels five wars with 
arab nations and in arab guerrilla attacks 
at jerusalems mount herzl military cemetery bereaved parents 
widows and orphans of fallen soldiers clung to tombstones while 
others wept silently

automobiles as well as hundreds of pedestrians to an abrupt halt 
israelis stood at attention in silent tribute 
prime minister yitzhak shamir in a 10minute nationally 
broadcast speech honored the fallen including eight soldiers 
killed during the 28month palestinian rebellion in the west bank 
and gaza strip 
our enemies sanctify and praise death in their struggle 
against us but we have always and will forever praise life even 
though our warriors and sons are ready to sacrifice their lives 
shamir said 
in a broadcast interview shamir pledged to continue israels 
settlement drive in the occupied territories despite us 
objections he also said progress toward peace negotiations do not 
depend on agreeing to us terms for palestinianisraeli peace 
talks 
israels governing coalition fell apart march 15 after shamir 
refused to endorse us peace proposals since then shamir has 
been caretaker prime minister 
the army on sunday strengthened forces in the occupied west bank 
and kept the 750000 palestinians in the gaza strip under curfew to 
prevent antiisraeli attacks 
but the security measures failed to stop masked arab assailants 
from shooting and fatally stabbing a west bank palestinian 
suspected of collaborating with israeli authorities hospital and 
arab reports said 
the reports identified the slain man as zuhair ijil 44 of the 
west bank town of elbireh 
his death brought to 210 the number of palestinians slain by 
fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with israeli 
authorities at least 680 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
troops and civilians in the rebellion and 43 israelis have also 
died in the violence

spokesman for new hampshire yankee 
its the third shutdown since the plant began tests march 20 to 
crank up to full power 
the utility had wanted to begin producing nuclearpowered 
electricity this week but tests showed that electrical feedback 
from the new england power network could cause a 200foot shaft in 
the turbine to vibrate beyond specifications 
roy morrison of the antinuclear clamshell alliance called the 
64 billion plant a piece of junk and said the shutdown is 
another example of why seabrook shouldnt be allowed to operate 
david scanzoni another utility spokesman said the reactor was 
shut down march 22 for adjustments and a week later because of 
questionable readings from sensors on the turbine 
well take all the time thats necessary were not schedule 
driven he said

switzerlands final bastion of 
male supremacy on sunday defiantly refused to give women the vote 
in local affairs 
the allmale swordcarrying legislative assembly of 
appenzellrhodes interior a northeastern canton overwhelmingly 
rejected a federallyproposed constitutional amendment on local 
suffrage for women 
it does not mean that we think that women are worth less 
said one man who addressed the gathering but it would not make 
women happier if they were happier in the countries where they 
have the vote i would immediately say yes 
the vote by a show of hands came two decades after swiss women 
won the vote on federal matters and 10 years after the federal 
constitution was revised to formally proclaim equal rights for both 
sexes 
swiss president and justice minister arnold koller a citizen of 
the canton was a guest of honor at the assembly which was 
broadcast live on swiss television the 4000 male legislators and 
residents at the assembly wore traditional swords to demonstrate 
their voting eligibility 
beat graf the newly elected head of the cantons government had 
urged support of the proposed change but was the only speaker to do 
so 
lifestyles have changed here too graf said we cannot 
forever refuse to join the development in the other cantons 
the cabinet of the neighboring principality of liechtenstein 
also attended sundays ceremony along with the ambassadors of 
sweden and spain thousands of tourists lined the assembly square 
and the streets of the picturesque small town a solemn colorful 
procession preceded the meeting 
appenzellrhodes interior is switzerlands smallest state and 
one of its poorest the mountainous rural state has a population 
of 13000 and is predominantly roman catholic the state has twice 
rejected womens suffrage once in 1973 and again in 1982 
the surprise decision was expected to leave the final say on the 
issue to switzerlands supreme court the federal tribunal pending 
the assembly the court had put off a ruling on a constitutional 
complaint filed by a woman resident of the canton she had invoked 
the federal constitutions equal rights article 
appenzell innerrhodes is the only one of switzerlands 26 
sovereign states or cantons that still denies women the vote on 
local issues ranging from budget questions to alcohol laws 
in a close vote neighboring appenzell outerrhodes granted the 
vote to women last year a 198687 survey of women in that state of 
50000 showed that only 57 percent favored having the right to vote

discovery glided safely 
back to earth on sunday landing with new brakes after launching 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope to search for clues to the 
universes creation 
nasa engineers in maryland meanwhile tried to figure out how 
to restore full movement to one of the telescopes two dishshaped 
highspeed antennas 
they believe the antenna was caught behind a cable that bent 
outward from its proper position before discovery was launched 
spokesman mike harrington said 
the shuttle touched down on a 15000foot concrete runway at 
this mojave desert military base at 649 am after a slackening of 
40 mph winds that threatened to delay the landing 
the spacecraft rolled to a stop 63 seconds later 
welcome back congratulations on a super mission ground 
communicator steve oswald told the shuttles crew the world is 
waiting to reap the benefits of your work over the next 15 years 
we sure enjoyed it also it was great fun replied loren j 
shriver discoverys commander 
about 20000 people cheered discoverys return as the national 
anthem blared through loudspeakers 
the astronauts emerged from the shuttle about 50 minutes after 
landing shriver was accompanied by pilot charles f bolden jr and 
mission specialists steven a hawley bruce mccandless ii and 
kathryn d sullivan 
a cheering crowd of several hundred people gave the astronauts a 
rousing sendoff before they boarded two jets to take them back to 
houston four hours after the landing 
the hubble space telescope is going to be a facility second to 
none hawley told the crowd over the next 10 15 and 20 years 
it will revolutionize the way we look at our universe and the way 
we understand where we came from and where were going 
seven hours after touchdown the astronauts returned home to 
houston where they were greeted at ellington field by about 300 
wellwishers they will have monday off before reporting back to 
work for a week of briefings 
engineers at nasas goddard space flight center in greenbelt 
md continued the monthslong process of checking out the 
43footlong telescope and its sophisticated instruments 
the highgain antenna should move from side to side 180 degrees 
and from front to overhead to back 180 degrees 
but when controllers moved it in recent days it apparently got 
caught behind a pretty hefty power cable that warped out from 
its normal position against the 15footlong arm supporting the 
antenna harrington said 
he said the engineers probably would attempt to back the antenna 
out of the trap sometime this week allowing 180degree motion on 
one axis and 150degree motion on the other 
recent inspection of photos taken just before discoverys 
payload bay doors were closed for launch revealed the cable had 
bowed outward said harrington 
our hope is that well be fully operational within a week 
deputy project manager jean olivier the first pictures i still 
feel are approximately a week away 
to learn more about the antenna problem the engineers got the 
telescope to transmit recorded data over a secondary lowgain 
antenna failure to fix the problem completely would somewhat limit 
the information the telescope can send back to earth olivier said 
to place the telescope in the proper orbit on wednesday 
discovery flew to an altitude of 380 miles higher than any 
previous shuttle 
the returning shuttle crossed the california coast near santa 
barbara announcing its arrival with the characteristic twin sonic 
booms 
discovery was the first shuttle to land with new carbon brakes 
similar to those on passenger jetliners installation and testing 
of new brakes on all the shuttles are steps toward the national 
aeronautics and space administrations plans to eventually land the 
craft at kennedy space center in florida 
the carbon brakes can withstand longer stopping distances and 
higher temperatures than the older beryllium brakes theyre 
expected to last for 50 landings the older brakes are designed for 
six 
william lenoir nasas associate administrator for space flight 
said the brakes worked very well loren shriver said they felt 
good firm and comfortable he said 
using the shuttles robot arm hawley deployed the hubble space 
telescope on wednesday one day after the shuttle was launched from 
cape canaveral fla 
from its orbit above the distorting effects of earths 
atmosphere the telescope is capable of detecting objects 50 times 
fainter and with 10 times more detail than the best groundbased 
observatory it has a 15year mission but nasa expects it will 
last years longer 
astronomers believe the hubble will be able to look at objects 
14 billion light years away 
the 12ton telescope is expected to help scientists better 
estimate the size and age of the universe which they believe was 
created about 15 billion years ago 
when controllers moved the telescopes highspeed antenna and 
again when the lens cover was opened friday for the first time the 
actions moved the telescope too much and an automatic system shut 
down the hubbles electronics it took more than a day to restore 
them 
discovery is scheduled to leave friday for its piggyback jet 
ride back to cape canaveral 
the next shuttle launch is scheduled for may 16 when columbia 
and seven astronauts will carry a 100 million observatory named 
astro into orbit

rebel gen michel aouns troops and 
militiamen of the rightwing lebanese forces militia skirmished in 
east beirut sunday but a 33hour ceasefire between the christian 
rivals held in the mountains 
there were no reports of casualties sunday in the 
threemonthold power struggle for mastery of the christian enclave 
north of beirut 
at least 919 people have been killed and 2442 wounded since 
fighting erupted jan 30 when aoun moved against the militia led by 
samir geagea 
the ceasefire in the kesrouan mountains on the eastern edge of 
the 310squaremile enclave took effect at 9 am saturday and was 
to end at 6 pm sunday 
the ceasefire was called primarily to allow residents of the 
disputed resorts of daraya and kleiat in the kesrouan mountains to 
return to the devastated towns to salvage what they can of their 
homes 
hundreds of refugees poured into the towns sunday while the 
ceasefire held police reported daraya has been deserted by 
nearly all its 12000 citizens and barely 200 of kleiats 20000 
residents remain 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the few remaining civilians still in the two 
resorts took advantage of the truce to leave before an expected 
resumption of fighting 
the conservative addiyar daily which is based in christian 
east beirut described the truce as a farce and added its like 
being invited to prepare the dead for burial 
the daily said the truce was declared so the residents could 
touch with their own hands the stones of their damaged homes 
and see with their own eyes the black smoke billowing from them 
kleiat has been severely damaged in the savage fighting between 
aouns troops and geageas militia the lebanese forces hold the 
western half of the town while aouns men control the northern 
edges 
both aoun and geagea men are maronites the main christian sect 
which has dominated politics the army and the judiciary since 
lebanons independence from france in 1943 
their power struggle has triggered the worst fighting between 
christian rivals since lebanons multifaceted civil war between 
christians and moslem broke out 15 years ago 
the fighting has caused damage estimated at 1 billion and 
forced 40 percent of the enclaves 1 million residents to flee to 
safer areas of lebanon or abroad

a windwhipped forest fire burned more than 
10000 acres in the isolated mountains of central pennsylvania on 
sunday before crews brought it under control near the banks of the 
susquehanna river 
the fire started saturday morning in the sproul state forest and 
moved north in warm dry weather authorities said 
the fire burned a swath roughly three miles wide and eight miles 
long to within several hundred yards of the susquehannas west 
branch where it was brought under control sunday afternoon said 
susan woods a spokeswoman for the department of environmental 
resources 
its still burning but it has been raining so that should 
help she said sunday afternoon 
the fire stalled about 10 miles west of renovo 
this is one of the worst singlefire losses weve had since 
the 1930s woods said 
about 200 firefighters were aided by helicopters dumping water 
and flame retardant chemicals and bulldozers digging 15foot wide 
trenches 
the fire began near a natural gas pipeline on a forest road but 
ms woods said there were no reports of explosions 
that wasnt determined to be a cause more than likely the 
cause was careless use of fire she said 
a 10000acre loss for pennsylvania is a lot ms woods 
said officials i spoke to couldnt remember a fire as serious as 
this 
by comparison fires charred about 16000 acres of forest in all 
of 1986 about 40000 acres were lost in 196263 during a drought 
she said 
warm temperatures low humidity and high winds saturday had 
raised the possibility of accidental fires she said 
four recreational camps in the state forest were destroyed ms 
woods said firefighters evacuated campers from the 540000acre 
state forest and no injuries were reported two people thought to 
be hiking through the area were found unharmed by searchers sunday 
morning she said 
the area about 30 miles north of state college is largely 
uninhabited and the fire posed no threat to homes she said 
at least three smaller forest fires were reported over the 
weekend near lewisburg in the poconos and in warren county ms 
woods said

west german officials closed the cash box on 
sunday and said they would refuse to assume a bigger financial 
burden to cushion east germanys leap into the free market 
higher taxes could result if the government of west german 
chancellor helmut kohl digs any deeper to ease east germanys 
transition from a socialist system officials said 
everyone must know that our offer is the maximum of what we 
could accept west germanys finance minister theo waigel said 
in an interview with the west german newspaper welt am sonntag 
economics minister helmut haussmann said in an interview in bild 
am sonntag that any more financial concessions would endanger the 
west german mark 
kohl told manual laborers at a festival in saarbruecken west 
germany he would oppose higher taxes to finance unification 
without being specific he said some of the ideas coming out of 
east germany were unrealistic 
we must also say that the prosperity in west germany did not 
fall from heaven but came from work he said 
meanwhile the administrator of 8000 east german stateowned 
enterprises was quoted as saying west german and foreign investors 
will be allowed to buy no more than 50 percent in each company that 
is privatized 
the west german newspaper die welt quoted the administrator 
peter moreth as saying the remainder of the companies will have a 
combined value of 178 billion after the economies of the germanys 
are combined 
moreths comments were released on sunday by die welt in advance 
of publication on monday there was no immediate comment from west 
germany 
east germans fear that their current enterprises will be 
completely taken over by west german or foreign interests once east 
germany becomes a free market economy 
also expressing concerns are east german farmers who worry that 
a flood of west german agricultural products will wreck their 
livelihoods 
protesting farmers drove hundreds of tractors and trucks on main 
roads in protest about 1200 farmers formed a 30mile caravan near 
herzberg 60 miles south of berlin the east german news agency adn 
said 
hundreds of farmers also blocked a road leading to nearby 
torgau where an east meets west jazz festival was held sunday 
soviet and american troops linked up in torgau on april 25 1945 
after invading nazi germany from opposite directions 
fears of the economic consequences of unification came a day 
before the latest round of talks on merging the disparate 
economies both germanys have said their economies and social 
institutions will be unified by july 2 
west germany last week said it was willing to exchange east 
german marks at a 11 rate for the powerful west german mark but 
it said personal savings of more than 2300 would be traded at a 
21 rate 
the government of east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
has said it wants a higher limit on savings accounts to make up for 
the loss of housing and food subsidies that were part of the former 
socialist system 
de maiziere has also said he wants to retain subsidies at least 
initially on rents energy and public services 
the merger of the economies will clear a major hurdle to 
unification a full political union would take place after 
allgerman elections which kohl is pushing to hold next year 
much of the debate in west germany has been influenced by dec 2 
national elections in that country opposition politicians charge 
that kohl already has made too many financial concessions to east 
germany 
some west germans fear that converting the nearly worthless east 
german mark at a 11 rate and absorbing east germanys faltering 
economy will reduce their buying power and fuel inflation and tax 
increases 
while the debate continues on the cost of unification de 
maiziere and other east german officials met with soviet officials 
in moscow sunday to discuss a united germanys strategic future 
the soviets want a united germany to be nonaligned and perhaps 
be a joint member of nato and the warsaw pact the united states 
and kohl want a unified germany to be part of the western alliance 
the foreign ministers from the four world war ii allies that 
divided germany the soviet union united states britain and 
france are to meet in bonn on saturday for their first formal 
negotiations on german unification

about 1000 haitians massed outside an alien 
detention center sunday tearing down a fence and calling on 
immigration officials to release their countrymen 
a special riot control team of 79 immigration and naturalization 
service officers was deployed to hold back the protesters as they 
crashed through one gate and advanced on another said ins district 
director richard smith 
the protesters heeded warnings to stop and no injuries or 
arrests were reported at the krome service processing center 25 
miles west of miami authorities said 
i warned them in creole and english if they didnt cease and 
desist id have to use tear gas on them to disperse the crowd 
smith said i think this is the closest weve come to a serious 
confrontation 
the rev gerard jeanjuste a leader of miamis haitian 
community said the protesters were seeking the release of haitian 
detainees some of whom have spent years in detention while their 
asylum cases are processed 
we want freedom and justice for the haitian refugees and all 
the refugees detained he said we must break down the walls of 
krome which remind us of hitlerism 
about 395 detainees are being kept at krome which has a 
capacity for some 450 detainees but has been overcrowded in the 
past more recently there have been allegations that guards 
harassed beat and sexually abused the detainees 
the allegations are under investigation by immigration officials 
and the justice departments office of the inspector general 
smith said the compound had gone on full alert sunday morning in 
anticipation of the planned rally the lockdown meant detainees 
were confined to their living quarters throughout the day and 
visits and church services were canceled he said 
while there were no problems inside the protesters outside 
tried to force their way in and got out of hand smith said no 
tear gas was fired on the crowd and it began to break up about 4 
pm after rallying for several hours he said 
jeanjuste said the gates were loose and people just began 
pouring inside 
smith said he only administers the law and if the haitian 
protesters want more detainees released they should take their 
concerns to elected officials 
engaging in violence is certainly not the way to get it 
done he said

east german prime minister lothar de maiziere said 
after a meeting sunday with mikhail s gorbachev that he failed to 
allay the soviet leaders concerns about a united germanys 
membership in nato 
after the twohour meeting in the kremlin the soviet news 
agency tass said the soviet president maintains a negative 
attitude to the onesided imbalanced proposal for the inclusion of 
the future united german government in nato it said it was 
paraphrasing gorbachevs remarks 
de maiziere said membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization was possible if nato develops a new strategy 
still de maiziere said the meeting was very constructive 
and would facilitate german reunification 
de maiziere accompanied by his ministers of defense foreign 
affairs and economics were in moscow for a day of talks preceding 
negotiations on german reunification may 5 in bonn west germany 
representatives of the two germanys as well as the four 
victorious world war ii allies the united states the soviet 
union britain and france will participate in the talks 
the west says a united germany should be a member of nato 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in an 
interview published saturday in ireland that a united germany 
should be nonaligned and could belong to both the western 
alliance and the warsaw pact 
de maiziere has said he opposes german neutrality and also 
stationing nato soldiers on east german territory until a new 
alleuropean security system can be arranged 
german neutrality would be contrary to the spirit of the 
times corresponding instead to the old mentality of blocs he 
told tass in east berlin saturday 
on sunday however he did not say what a european security 
system should look like but did say it should also guarantee 
soviet security 
gorbachev did not accept our nato proposal so other solutions 
will have to be found he said 
tass said soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov told his east 
german counterpart rainer eppelmann a united germanys 
membership in nato may influence the balance of forces in europe 
and destabilize international relations 
economic relations with a united germany and ensuring soviet 
security are moscows principal concerns east germany has been a 
key member of the warsaw pact military alliance and an important 
trading partner for the soviet union

lithuanias official radio said sunday that the 
soviet union was easing its economic blockade against the baltic 
republic by nearly doubling the supply of natural gas lithuanias 
president said it was only a promise 
the radio report said the natural gas was bound for a factory 
that supplies moscow with chemicals and fertilizers 
nothing has been connected lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis told nbc news sunday afternoon it was promised that 
the gas supply was being increased he said but that has not 
happened 
a lithuanian government spokesman also said that as of late 
sunday increased gas supplies had not yet arrived 
residents of the baltic republic which declared independence 
march 11 organized a bicycle rally sunday to show their defiance 
of the blockade 
an estimated 20000 more gathered in cathedral square in the 
capital vilnius to hear the republics orchestra perform 
beethovens ninth symphony landsbergis a music professor has 
said that for him the symphony symbolizes hope and humanitys 
victory over slavery 
word of the sudden easing of the gas restriction came after both 
lithuania and a spokesman for president mikhail s gorbachev 
praised a proposed compromise to their dispute offered by france 
and west germany the two western countries proposed lithuania 
delay implementing its independence without rescinding the 
declaration itself 
the soviet union has cut off all oil supplies and shipments of 
many manufactured goods raw materials and food items in an effort 
to make lithuania back away from the declaration of independence 
vilnius radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp in 
london said the industrial plant at jonova whose natural gas 
supplies had been drastically cut was being resupplied the plant 
supplies the soviet union with concentrated ammonium resins 
methanol and other products 
if the amount promised the plant were delivered it would nearly 
double the total natural gas flowing into the republic 
but paul pauparas manager of the supreme council legislatures 
information department said in a telephone interview that no extra 
supplies of gas had been received as of sunday evening 
operators at the plant have no exact information whether it 
will be really renewed or it is only promises he said 
he said details of the agreement to increase the flow of gas 
likely were provided directly to the plant director by moscow but 
that government officials in vilnius had not been able to confirm 
specifics 
earlier rita radzavicius a spokeswoman for the information 
department had confirmed that the jonova plant had started to 
receive its allotment of gas 
the radio said the jonova plant was to receive about 105 million 
cubic feet of natural gas each day almost sufficient for the 
plant to keep operating normally it said 
radio vilnius said from the beginning of the blockade all of 
lithuania had been receiving about 123 million cubic feet of 
natural gas per day just enough for everyday household needs 
before the blockade began the republic received about 635 million 
cubic feet of natural gas a day 
pauparas said the jonova plant had been receiving only about 
247 million cubic feet of gas a day and that most of its major 
production facilities already had been shut down 
that meant a loss to the soviet union of chemicals and 
fertilizers normally supplied by the plant he said adding that 
lithuania uses a relatively small proportion of the products made 
there 
if the plant resumes full production it will continue 
fulfilling its previous contracts pauparas said 
the radio said about 30 percent of the plants work force or 
more than 1000 people would be going back to work on monday they 
had been forced out of work because of shortage of gas 
there was no official announcement by moscow of a change of 
policy but in an interview with the tass news agency saturday the 
deputy chairman of the soviet state supply committee vladimir 
kosyunin said lithuania was receiving 30 percent of its normal 
share of natural gas when the restriction went into effect more 
than a week ago it was receiving only about 16 percent 
gorbachev demanded two weeks ago that lithuania rescind new laws 
that exempted lithuanians from the soviet military draft gave 
ownership of communist party buildings to lithuanias independent 
communists and established new rules on citizenship that russians 
living in lithuania considered discriminatory 
when the demands were not met the kremlin imposed the economic 
blockade earlier moscow seized buildings conducted military 
maneuvers and barred most foreigners from the republic of 38 
million people

an overflow crowd celebrated mass at 
star of the sea church on sunday as lava from kilauea volcano 
advanced on them 
about 50 parishioners met afterward to discuss whether to move 
the church and most appeared to favor saving it but some wanted 
to leave it at the site regardless of the consequences 
the group decided to forward its opinions to bishop joseph 
ferrario head of the roman catholic church in hawaii and abide by 
his decision 
one parishioner who spoke in favor of relocating told the story 
of a man trapped on the roof of his home during a flood when a 
boat came by the man declined a ride saying he was waiting for a 
sign from god he then declined a ride in a helicopter 
finally he drowned when he went to heaven he asked god why he 
didnt send a sign what do you mean god replied i sent you 
a boat and a helicopter 
god gave us the intelligence to save this church the 
parishioner said 
a female church elder though told the group that if they loved 
their church they should allow it to stand at its present site 
during a previous kilauea eruption in 1977 a lava flow that 
scientists said was nearly certain to overrun the town and the 
painted church petered out threequarters of a mile from the 
church some kalapana residents called it a miracle 
bruce butts of hawaii county civil defense said the flow has 
moved within 400 yards of the towns center not far from the site 
of the church 
no more homes had been destroyed by early sunday afternoon 
although several remain in danger of being torched by days end 
the flow had light to moderate movement overnight 
remaining residents of the subdivision were ordered to move 
their belongings out as lava threatened to block off the two 
remaining access roads to the subdivision 
some people gathered saturday night for a last night in 
kalapana party 
so far 115 homes have been burned since the volcano began 
erupting in january 1983 thirtynine homes have been destroyed in 
april

a film released by romanias interim government 
showing the firingsquad execution of former leaders nicolae and 
elena ceausescu was faked according to french forensic experts 
cited by the sun of baltimore 
the conclusion furthers suspicions among experts on the country 
that the two probably were victims of a coup detat carried out 
under cover of the popular revolution the newspaper reported 
sunday from its paris bureau 
the 90minute film of ceausescus trial and execution which 
appeared in pirated and official versions on french television last 
week indicated the couple may have been killed separately by 
single shots to their heads and their corpses later propped up for 
a staged execution forensic experts in paris said 
the bodies should have been bulletriddled but when lifted for 
the camera were not bloody said the analysts who were not 
identified by the newspaper 
elena ceausescu lay over a stream of blood but when a doctor 
lifted her head it was stiff and no blood trickled out the 
forensic experts said the blood on her head and on the ground had 
coagulated they said rigor mortis had set in and that she must 
have been dead for four or five hours 
near her her husband lying backward on his knees appeared 
more pliable his head bobbed when doctors lifted it but again no 
blood trickled the experts concluded he had probably been killed 
well after his wife 
the footage also broadcast in romania last week was released 
by romanias interim government in the apparent belief that it 
would rally support for the ruling national salvation front before 
the may 20 elections 
the footage shows the trial and after an abrupt break cuts to 
the ostensible execution by firing squad the film did not show the 
dictator and his wife as they awaited the gunfire rather it cut 
to a foursecond burst of gunfire across a field raising a cloud 
of smoke and dust against a wall 
rasvan theodorescu president of the governmentowned free 
romanian television station which released one version of the 
trial and execution denied last week that the firing squad 
execution could have been faked he said there were no more than 
five minutes between the sentence and execution 
analysts have said the national salvation front probably planned 
the coup for a later date but went into action with the first 
reports of anticeausescu protests springing up in timisoara dec 
15 
there was a plot to overthrow ceausescu said pierre 
hassner a romanianborn specialist on eastern europe at the center 
of international study and research in paris there was also a 
movement from below 
hassner said leaders of the front appeared to have known each 
other before the uprising and there have been reports in the french 
press that several of them visited the soviet union before assuming 
power 
the film an extended version of the brief footage shown 
earlier for the first time shows the faces of the 10man military 
tribunal that judged the ceausescus sitting on the tribunal were 
the current deputy prime minister gelu voican and victor 
stanculescu a former general of the feared securitate security 
police who is now defense minister

campaigning officially began 
sunday for the countrys first free elections five weeks away but 
president vaclav havel said real democracy is at least two years 
away 
these elections are more like a rehearsal havel said 
they are free enough but happening in a politically immature 
situation 
speaking in his regular sunday radio broacast havel also said 
he would seek another twoyear term as president if it would help 
see through the transition to full democracy 
in case it turns out to be necessary ill do it he said 
the elections the first free balloting after more than four 
decades of communist rule are scheduled for june 89 a total of 
23 parties and movements are competing for seats in the new 
parliament and campaigning officially began sunday 
the new parliament which is to implement farreaching economic 
reforms will have a twoyear mandate 
in the elections based on proportional representation only 
parties that win at least 5 percent of the national vote will gain 
seats in parliament this is considered likely to exclude from 
parliament several of the smaller parties competing 
opinion polls published in the last week indicated the civic 
forum a loose opposition group founded by havel that played a key 
role in overthrowing the hardline communist leadership last year 
is among the most popular political movements with the support of 
about 20 percent of the voters 
the coalition of christian democrats expected to gain support 
in slovakia the countrys strongly roman catholic easternmost 
part is a close second 
civic forum last week announced an informal coalition with the 
environmentalist greens another movement enjoying popular support 
in a country devastated by four decades of industrialization that 
ignored ecological concerns 
the communist party of czechoslovakia still claiming 1 million 
members in a population of 155 million is under continuous attack 
by opposition parties anticommunist sentiment is considered 
likely to be a campaign issue 
i strongly believe that the democratic forces the only 
guarantee of democracy in this country will prevail havel said 
the citizens must go out and take part in the elections because 
everyones vote will count in deciding about the future of this 
country

a san salvador bishop said 
sunday that us military aid to his country should be used to aid 
the poor and solve social problems that have fueled the 10yearold 
civil war 
weapons must be traded for plows as soon as possible bishop 
gregorio rosa chavez said in his sunday sermon 
our youth have no hope for the future while working conditions 
dont change while we dont overcome the unemployment problem 
while the working man is not the main cause of worry of the 
government he said 
on thursday the house foreign relations committee approved a 
proposal to cut in half its annual 85 million in military aid to 
el salvador 
but the house also specified that the money would be restored if 
salvadoran rebels continue to receive foreign arms mount a 
military offensive or thwart proposed peace talks 
the house also stated that the aid would be cut completely if 
the government does not negotiate with the rebels in good faith or 
fails to adequately investigate the murder of six jesuits last year 
funds cut from the military aid program are to go toward social 
programs in el salvador 
rightwing president alfredo cristiani has threatened to slash 
social programs to increase the military budget if the us aid is 
reduced 
it is grave for me to think that the war should be paid for by 
the poorest those who suffer the most because of the war rosa 
chavez said 
hundreds of thousands of salvadorans have been displaced by the 
fighting and unemployment or underemployment in the country is 
estimated at almost 45 percent 
weapons are always a danger which is why peace is not built 
with weapons it is built with reason and dialogue rosa chavez 
said 
rosa chavez is one of san salvadors bishops and an auxiliary to 
archbishop arturo rivera damas 
un officials have agreed to act as intermediaries in a new 
round of peace talks scheduled to begin wednesday 
the salvadoran church has been a severe critic of the war that 
has claimed some 72000 lives and was a prime influence in the 
start of earlier peace talks

was too well girlish take a memo please its now called girls 
incorporated 
in what officials called a historic vote sunday the national 
organization that once concentrated on homemaking skills hobbies 
and charm is showing its evolution with the new name 
this is the biggest thing thats happened to us in the 45 
years weve been operating said executive director margaret 
gates it means that well be framing a new identity for a 
45yearold organization 
actually that framing began five to 10 years ago she said 
when the clubs spent more than 10 million to develop new 
educational programs such as a science and math project called 
operation smart 
ms gates emerging from the organizations annual board meeting 
in atlanta sunday said the 80 board members present approved the 
new name in an overwhelming voice vote 
we thought that club sounded a little recreational right 
now a lot of the work were doing with girls is more educational 
ms gates said 
the name change also was prompted by the boys clubs of americas 
decision two years ago to add girls to its name to reflect its 
growing female membership 
the girls club became concerned that the boys clubs new name 
would obscure its identity and confuse the donors who provide about 
80 percent of the operating budget 
that was the catalyst ms gates said 
in any case the clubs havent been clubby in years with 
the emphasis shifting to educating and preparing girls to compete 
and compensate for subtle sexism they may encounter while growing 
up 
the clubs cite evidence that shows such inequities begin in the 
classroom studies show girls fare more poorly than boys on the 
scholastic aptitude test although they generally score the same as 
or higher than boys on standardized tests in elementary school 
other studies including one by american university professors 
myra and david sadker show that boys get more attention in 
classrooms are encouraged to do their own work without teacher 
help and are disciplined more effectively which helps them deal 
with criticism better 
there are 250000 girls in girls incorporated but there are 
also 65000 boys who often are admitted in one of the groups 200 
centers if they live in areas where there are no boys clubs 
but the focus of our activity is girls and the special needs 
that they have because girls are now in a period in which their 
roles as young women as changing very rapidly ms gates added

a ski boat crashed into a wooden dock 
on a lake sunday killing the three men and one woman aboard 
authorities said 
the victims were discovered by a local man at about 11 am when 
the crippled boat bodies inside drifted near his backyard on 
doctors lake south of jacksonville 
i saw the boat against the shore and it looked like some 
fishermen were sleeping said leslie teller 70 i went over 
and then i saw one with a big gash in his forehead and i knew they 
were all dead 
the victims apparently died instantly said capt william m 
glover of the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
it appears they ran under the dock glover said the 
victims who were sitting in their seats had severe head injuries 
the dock sheared the windshield off and tore the outboard engine 
off the boat 
the private boat dock apparently did not have and was not 
required to have any lighting or reflectors glover said 
authorities havent determined how fast the ski boat which had a 
150horsepower outboard engine was going 
we had two lakearea residents tell us that they heard a loud 
noise between 1 and 2 am sunday morning said sgt chuck 
vavrek a clay county sheriffs department spokesman it appears 
that they just did not see the dock 
authorities identified the victims as anthony raymond bosten 
21 and steven lewis findley 26 both of middleburg and debra a 
lee 28 and james daniel rooney 25 both of jacksonville none 
wore life vests 
state fish and game officers searched the water near the dock 
for about five hours sunday but no other victims were found 
vavrek said 
authorities also found several containers of beer inside the 
boat but glover declined to discuss whether alcohol might have 
contributed to the accident

tuesday but said it will allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to 
remain pending a final ruling on the dispute 
speaking from his apartment window overlooking st peters 
square the pope said 
i wish to invite you to be spiritually close with me to the 
brothers of east jerusalem especially to the leaders of the 
venerable christian churches the grave incidents which occurred 
recently in the holy city and which led to the painful decision to 
close the holy sites temporarily particularly the basilica of the 
holy sepulchre are also for me reason for suffering and profound 
concern 
john paul said he was praying for peace in jerusalem a city 
that is preeminently holy and dear to all three monotheistic 
religions

a white african national congress 
leader who returned from exile told a large rally sunday that the 
threat of war with south africas black majority forced the 
whiteled government to negotiate 
there cant be any doubt that because we spoke with an ak47 
that dialogue is in the air said joe slovo leader of the south 
african communist party and a member of the anc executive speaking 
before an estimated 30000 people 
slovo a former commander of the ancs military wing was 
referring to the sovietdesigned ak47 assault rifle 
at the same rally anc deputy president nelson mandela urged 
white south africans to make it possible for the anc to throw 
away its guns 
we dont want this country reduced to ashes he said 
slovo and other anc leaders returned to south africa after 
president fw de klerk legalized the anc the communist party and 
58 other organizations in february mandela was freed from prison 
at that time 
the anc leaders told the mostly black crowd that they would 
demand majority rule and a redistribution of wealth when they 
negotiate with the white government 
an anc delegation led by mandela is scheduled to meet with de 
klerk and members of his cabinet for three days of preliminary 
talks starting on wednesday 
de klerk has said that anc calls for armed struggle and 
widespread violence in black townships most of it between anc 
supporters and rival black groups hinder negotiations 
mandela told the crowd that the government had objected to 
slovos inclusion in the anc delegation because he is a communist 
but mandela called slovo a true son of south africa and said 
that communists will be represented in the anc delegation 
we are going to do nothing to betray those who have stood 
loyally by us for so many years mandela said about half of the 
ancs executive committee are communists

electricity was to be cut that day throughout manila because of the 
nations power crisis the trial date was then set for the 
following day 
overcrowding and electrical failure were not the only problems 
on the opening day of the trial which was to underscore the aquino 
governments commitment to crack down on the mutineers

santiago pointed out that philippine flag behind the tribunal was 
inverted military rebels use the inverted national flag as their 
banner

to the south but refused to order them into battle according to 
the charges 
military investigators have recommended 60 other officers be

when carl icahns proposal to break up usx corp 
comes to a vote at the steelenergy companys annual meeting next 
week shareholders will be passing judgment on how much influence a 
corporate raider has now that the easymoney takeover boom seems to 
be over 
if icahns proposal to spin off the companys us steel 
subsidiary is rejected as management hopes it will be he could 
still emerge a winner and make strategists like himself a more 
powerful force in us corporations 
sometimes something good comes out of a battle thats lost 
said robert w vishny a university of chicago graduate school of 
business professor 
israel shaked a professor at boston universitys school of 
management predicted even if they usx management win i think 
they are going to do something unless they have a clear loss for 
icahn 
icahn usxs largest shareholder with a 133 percent stake has 
hounded usx management for years to restructure sell assets and 
raise the companys stock price company executives have agreed 
that their stock is undervalued but they have consistently 
dismissed icahns suggestions on ways to improve it 
the takeover strategist who is also the chairman of trans world 
airlines originally threatened a shareholderproxy fight for 
control of the usx board at the may 7 meeting in findlay ohio 
but he agreed to put that idea aside in exchange for a 
nonbinding vote on his proposal to separate the firms struggling 
steel assets from its healthier marathon oil co subsidiary 
icahn is in a similar position to that held by texas investor 
harold simmons who waged a proxy fight for control of lockheed 
corp in march 
simmons lockheeds biggest stockholder lost that vote but he 
helped awaken the defense firms big institutional investors who 
in turn forced lockheed management to make some big concessions 
simmons proved that the threat of a raid or a proxy fight can shift 
some of the balance of power from management to shareholders 
theres just a lot more pressure brought to bear on the 
board in a stockholder vote vishny said 
if icahn can garner a majority it will strengthen the hands of 
big investors like him and companies likely will see more dissident 
proposals and proxy battles going to shareholder votes 
proxy fights were in vogue in the days before it became 
relatively easy to acquire a company by selling junk bonds a risky 
form of iou popularized during the 1980s takeover era famed 
raiders such as icahn simmons and t boone pickens once wielded 
enormous threats simply by saying they had the junk bond financing 
to back them up 
but the use of junk bonds in takeover strategies has sharply 
dropped since the collapse of the federated department stores inc 
debtfinanced buyout last fall that collapse caused the value of 
many junk bonds to tumble 
the notion of taking proposals to shareholders or trying to win 
control in a proxy fight has regained some lost appeal 
whether icahn wins or loses will not be determined solely by a 
vote count he alluded to that possibility himself last week during 
a meeting with investors and analysts 
if his proposal fails icahn said he would look at how badly i 
lose and whether usx management made any promises to investors 
as lockheed did in its battle with simmons before deciding what 
his next step would be 
others who have followed the wrangling between companies and 
takeover investors agree that the size of the vote is important 
if 48 percent of the shareholders are dissatisfied and you 
are a responsible member of the board you dont say business as 
usual said boston universitys shaked 
if they restructure and eventually split he will win 
anyway he said 
icahn also has history on his side 
harry deangelo a professor at the university of michigan said 
that in past proxy fights even though the dissidents usually 
lose the vote in the overwhelming majority of cases they 
accomplish some of their objectives 
he cited as an example the board of allegis corp now known as 
ual corp faced with a proxy fight and intensifying shareholder 
anger it canned chairman richard ferris in 1987 and sold the 
companys assets except for united airlines that was exactly the 
path the dissidents wanted the company to take 
they didnt win a vote or gain control of the corporation but 
they got something important deangelo said 
icahn himself is proof that a loser can still come out ahead he 
lost a proxy fight at texaco inc in 1988 but the nations 
thirdlargest oil company later restructured by selling billions of 
dollars in assets and issuing an 8 a share dividend which gave 
icahn a 3386 million bonus 
negative publicity about companies and their problems has helped 
further the process of change in many cases including lockheed 
allegis and texaco and this could be a factor at usx as well 
pressure to do something in terms of splitting up the assets 
is already being felt shaked said

sir james goldsmiths failed takeover of bat 
industries plc underscores growing antitakeover sentiment in the 
united states and distaste for americanstyle megabids in europe 
experts say 
the goldsmithled investor group hoylake investments ltd last 
week said it wouldnt renew its hostile 22 billion offer for the 
british conglomerate the move came amid roadblocks to us state 
regulatory approval 
the purchase would have been the worlds secondlargest takeover 
after kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 25 billion acquisition of 
rjr nabisco inc completed early last year 
the era of truly giant takeovers may now be consigned with 
some confidence to the 1980s the daily economic newspaper the 
financial times wrote 
the general demise of the us junk bond market and the guilty 
plea last week by junk bond wizard michael milken have increased 
negative attitudes toward the highyield highrisk bonds and the 
takeovers they financed 
california state insurance regulator two weeks ago blocked a 
change of ownership of bats farmers insurance group inc of los 
angeles hoylake had planned to sell farmers to the french 
insurance company axamidi assurances 
the offer also needed the green light from eight other states 
where farmers operates hoylake suspended its bid last september 
while it sought the clearances 
the failure illustrates the increasingly complex international 
nature of takeovers said joanna gant deputy editor of the british 
publication acquisitions monthly 
goldsmith who built his reputation of taking over and breaking 
up american companies hoped the grass would be greener in europe 
he was joined by british merchant banker jacob rothschild and 
australian businessman kerry packer 
certainly the us is becoming more defensive ms gant 
said people thought it was the japanese who they were afraid of 
and now it seems they are afraid of anyone from overseas 
that includes the british with whom americans traditionally 
have had strong ties 
norton co workers burned a union jack on the steps of the 
worcester mass city hall last month to protest a 16 billion 
takeover bid for the abrasives maker by the british industrial 
company btr plc 
earlier this month the massachusetts legislature rushed 
approval of a bill designed to bolster nortons defense by 
requiring staggered terms for corporate directors with only 
onethird elected each year that makes it almost impossible for a 
raider to gain board control quickly 
norton last week accepted a friendly 18 billion offer from the 
french glass maker compagnie saintgobain 
the us barriers are raising alarms in britain whose companies 
are big buyers of american businesses 
it would be tempting to dismiss state antitakeover laws as 
just a fit of temporary madness the economist magazine wrote 
but they represent a growing contempt for shareholders combined 
with a revolt against all forms of takeover it said 
jonathan mervis chief executive of jp mervis and co ltd a 
londonbased acquisitions adviser said antitakeover measures 
give incumbent management the right to run the business without 
really being answerable to anyone to their shareholders 
that will cause the pendulum the swing the other way he 
said 
the hoylake offer had appeared unlikely to succeed even without 
us obstacles in the end it only garnered between 1 percent and 
2 percent of bats stock 
critics objected to the highly leveraged nature of the bid 
which was to have been 80 percent debtfinanced hoylake belatedly 
said it might include some cash in the offer 
a probable factor in goldsmiths failure was the collapse of 
drexel burnham lambert inc the junk bond investment firm that 
hoylake had hired to help line up its financing 
another factor was bats quick response to the bid it launched 
a major restructuring selling and spinning off its retailing and 
paper businesses to concentrate on tobacco and financial services 
the plan which also involves bat buying up to 10 percent of its 
own stock and increasing dividends was designed to enhance value 
to shareholders 
goldsmith and other bat critics had complained that bats shares 
did not reflect the true value of the company because they were 
dragged down by the relatively slow growth of its tobacco 
operations goldsmith had proposed unbundling bat by selling 
off its nontobacco businesses

jill zalben says her gift baskets make a 
lovely mothers day gift nicely wrapped in cellophane and full of 
things mom would want a flashlight purified drinking water and 
antibiotic ointment 
even mothers ms zalben notes should be prepared for an 
earthquake 
the earthquakedisaster gift basket was among thousands of 
quakerelated items available at sales booths at the earthquake 
preparedness show over the weekend 
a growing number of entrepreneurs have found profit in quake 
preparedness as they cater to public nervousness in an increasingly 
shaky california following last years devastating san francisco 
quake 
big companies are among those jumping on the readiness 
bandwagon such as sears roebuck amp co with toughtested hardware 
and honda with shiny red generators 
everything from 150 bags of freezedried food to an 8500 
quake warning system for schools was featured at the show in booths 
decorated with colorful balloons and grisly photographs of 
earthquake death and destruction 
the show also included exhibits by utilities and government 
agencies to tell jittery californians how to store supplies turn 
off the gas and survive after a big quake 
ms zalben who calls herself the earthquake lady offered 
the most attractive packaging for earthquake survival supplies 
with prices ranging from 4999 for the small model to 14999 for 
the deluxe basket 
the baskets also include such items as carbohydrate food bars 
3600 calories each surgical tape waterproof pill vial 
cleansing towelettes in foil packets am radio battery included 
and a box of waterproof matches 
ms zalben who also operates camping supply stores came up 
with the idea after last octobers san francisco earthquake a 
71magnitude temblor that killed more than 60 people and caused at 
least 6 billion in damage 
we thought this would be a soft way of giving an item thats 
real serious she said standing next to a sign that read is 
your mother prepared 
like ms zalben most of the vendors entrepreneurial spirit was 
jolted by the san francisco quake or the two 1987 whittier quakes 
that killed eight people and caused 358 million in damage 
the whittier narrows quake gave norm anderson the idea of 
building plastic containers sealed with a weatherproof lid the 
containers are buried in the back yard for storing quake supplies 
that could be damaged or inaccessible in a destroyed house 
his disaster survival vaults cost 49 for the 74gallon home 
model and 389 for the 40gallon executive model 
several booths offered a variety of light sources including 
flashlights operated by battery by a crank or mounted on a pair of 
glassless eyeglasses 
in earthquakes the power goes off and you have to get to a 
problem maybe you need both of your hands free said frank 
tusuei who was selling the magic eyes a flashlight 
substitution for 795 batteries are extra 
gary martin said quake victims might not need a flashlight at 
all if they buy his cyalume lightsticks all one has to do is 
unwrap his plastic cylinders bend one in half and a chemical 
reaction produces 12 hours of artificial light 
and dont worry if its too dark to unwrap the lightstick the 
box glows in the dark martin explained a glowing box of two

after 78 years gerber products co this 
week will ban the public from watching how babies carrots are 
crushed and their peas pureed partly for fear of industrial 
espionage 
we realize theres nothing that can replace a plant tour the 
sights the sound the noise said gerber spokesman steve poole 
but plant tours have really become an anachronism its just a 
reality of modern technology he said we know our competition 
has been through the tour because weve spotted their sales reps 
we cant afford to take any chances 
some 15000 visitors a year have taken the free tour which 
covers about 10 percent of the 1millionsquarefoot plant at 
first they walked but in recent years batteryoperated carts were 
brought in 
from a mezzanine window a group of hairnetted visitors watched 
recently as thousands of washed and peeled carrots careened down a 
chute into a hopper creating a dash of color on an otherwise gray 
factory floor 
then the carrots are ground and mixed with other vegetables 
said mary kay ward speaking through a portable microphone to be 
heard above the whir of machinery shuttling thousands of jars along 
conveyor belts 
its too bad that something thats been so popular over the 
years should have to end said dorothy rice who led most of the 
tours over the last 18 years before retiring last week 
gerber is only the latest food company to ban public tours in 
1986 the kellogg co stopped giving tours of its cereal plant in 
battle creek 
in this age of liability insurance and increased productivity 
and high technology plant tours just dont fit in said analyst 
john mcmillin of prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
gerbers visitors center will close friday and reopen on labor 
day as a childrens art gallery and 60seat theater 
visitors will watch a fiveminute 3d movie about infant life 
from the infants perspective and a short video will show how baby 
food is made 
gerber decided to produce the movie knowing that 15000 visitors 
a year means a lot in a community of 3500 
the towns strong identification with gerber which began as the 
fremont canning co in 1901 is clear from the signs for gerber 
life insurance co and gerber memorial hospital in the 
onestoplight downtown 
the innocent eyes of the gerber baby peer down from billboards 
at drivers entering the town a sign proclaims fremont the baby 
food capital most of the companys 1200 local employees live in 
or around fremont where a halfbillion jars of baby food are made 
each year 
though first shaken by the news fremont business leaders 
believe theyll survive and perhaps prosper with a different 
attraction 
fred howes president of the chamber of commerce said hes 
not convinced that the general public is that enraptured by 
manufacturing processes anymore 
gerber hopes the film will appeal to whole families including 
children and senior citizens who didnt necessarily want to 
experience manufacturing closeup not to mention the 120degree 
temperatures in parts of the plant 
with 39 million babies born each year 15000 people a year 
doesnt represent an impact on our 70 percent brand share 
poole said but its important to the community even if people 
just stop by and have an ice cream cone at the local establishment 
thats important to that establishment

a soviet economist says the country is on the 
brink of uncontrollable inflation thanks to shrinking production 
budget deficits and a rapid increase in the money supply 
an article by yegor gaidar was displayed prominently in the 
authoritative communist party daily pravda on sunday it came as 
the soviet leadership debates a radical reform program to pull the 
country from a financial crisis 
the escalating financial crisis took us to the edge beyond 
which suppressed inflation will break into the open regardless of 
the will of the government or trade unions gaidar wrote 
falling production and more money in the hands of consumers is 
rapidly increasing longstable prices the money supply is growing 
at a rate six to eight times faster than it was a decade ago and 
production of many capital goods is falling gaidar said 
on the open farmers markets the price of meat has increased 16 
percent the price of vegetables 13 percent and the price of fruit 
20 percent he said 
gaidars article analyzed grim economic statistics for the first 
quarter of 1990 that showed soviet industrial production falling 
12 percent oil production fell 4 percent and coal production fell 
6 percent 
while production of consumer goods rose by 47 percent that of 
capital goods plummeted 32 percent gaidar said 
more soviet workers were on strike about 130000 people were on 
strike on any given day during the first quarter of 1990 he said 
government financial policy has aggravated the countrys 
financial woes gaidar said to function normally in conditions 
of reform the national economy needs stable finances and a firm 
ruble he wrote 
the government was supposed to cut its expenditures and raise 
its income in order to bring its budget deficit in line gaidar 
said 
instead the supreme soviet debates how to reduce taxes and 
for what purposes to increase expenditures that no one seems to be 
able to pay for the article said 
faith in the soviet economic structure is so low that government 
grain purchases are falling despite a good harvest last fall 
gaidar said he said farms are holding onto their grain to barter 
it for needed goods and services rather than selling it to the 
government 
gaidar said the soviet union has had some success fighting 
shortages of sugar and laundry detergent but in a disorganized 
market solving one problem only leads to other shortages 
now fabrics razors pencils and cigarettes are in short supply 
he said 
president mikhail gorbachevs presidential council is 
considering a package of economic reforms that the soviet leader 
says give his country a market economy 
after some reports that the country was considering following 
polishstyle shock therapy of rapidly increasing prices and 
cutting work forces officials say they will not use such a model 
soviet economic officials say they are concerned about how much 
more difficulty frustrated consumers are willing to accept

the police crackdown on striking 
workers at the hyundai shipyard signals a new government resolve to 
keep labor in check in order to bolster the faltering south korean 
economy 
costs are rising land speculation is rampant and inflation is 
increasing at an annual rate above 10 percent for the first time in 
many years exports arent selling and the stock market is at a 
twoyear low 
the government has been warning citizens for several months that 
it feels the economy is under siege and that koreans have a duty to 
put the nations interests first in a word that means work 
but the governments efforts may backfire 
thousands of workers and radical students clashed with riot 
police over the weekend and a dissident labor organization has 
called for a nationwide general strike on tuesday the may day 
labor holiday to protest saturdays police attack on the 
strikebound shipyard in ulsan 200 miles southeast of seoul 
protesters denounced the attack as a government ploy to thwart 
labor activism and dissent 
when thousands of riot police surrounded the hyundai heavy 
industries co shipyard the largest in the world few doubted 
their intent last year 12000 police stormed the complex to end 
another strike 
the government said the work stoppage by 20000 laborers 
reportedly costing hyundai 6 million a day was illegal 
at company request and in the national interest the government 
promised action unless strikers returned to work at dawn saturday 
the strikes fourth day thousands of riot police backed up by 
armored vans firing tear gas attacked the shipyard complex 
labor leaders said president roh taewoos government is more 
repressive than past authoritarian regimes and has imprisoned 
unfairly more than 200 labor leaders since taking office in 1988 
the figure could not be verified 
labor unrest steep wage hikes and the rise of the south korean 
won against the dollar have hurt south korean products ability to 
compete overseas koreas international image as a safe and 
affordable place to do business also has suffered 
the survival of the national economy was at stake park 
heetae spokesman for the ruling democratic liberal party said in 
defending the crackdown 
cheap labor and lowinterest loans to big businesses like 
hyundai have been a key ingredient to building south koreas 
economy worker desires for better pay and living conditions have 
spurred calls for more democracy 
low wages allowed south korea to mass produce cars electronics 
footwear textiles and toys at competitive prices and sell them 
overseas by 1989 south korea proclaimed itself the worlds 10th 
largest trading nation 
but labor is no longer cheap and workers are demanding more 
rights including involvement in business and personnel decisions 
affecting their managers and company presidents 
wages have increased 50 percent to 60 percent in south korea in 
the last two years rivalling or surpassing those of other asian 
countries many goods that used to sell easily to other nations no 
longer are competitive even comparable japanese products can be 
better priced 
the plight of workers now has improved much in recent years 
said chong unbung a political analyst 
but some workers still live in substandard housing and receive 
low pay many feel its time they received a larger share of the 
korean economic pie 
companies are being asked to swallow cost increases in an 
attempt to keep consumer prices down which cuts earnings 
consumers are being asked to forgo foreign imports and practice 
thrift 
south koreas economy grew only 65 percent last year after 
three successive years of growth exceeding 10 percent though the 
rate is acceptable by international standards government 
economists say korea needs at least 75 percent growth to control 
unemployment 
the countrys current account registered a 11 billion deficit 
in the first quarter of 1990 compared to a 13 billion surplus in 
the same 1989 period firstquarter exports declined 12 percent to 
139 billion 
when the korean stock market hit its lowest level since 1988 
last week angry investors stormed trading offices smashing 
computer terminals and furniture shrines were set up with hogs 
heads rice cakes and fruit to pray for a turnaround
