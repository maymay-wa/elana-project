eleanor holmes norton a former carter 
administration official and the frontrunner in a campaign for the 
district of columbias nonvoting congressional seat disclosed 
saturday that she and her husband failed to file local income tax 
returns for eight years 
the georgetown university law professor said in a written 
statement that she learned saturday for the first time that the 
1982 through 1989 tax returns she signed were never mailed by her 
husband 
she blamed the failure on procrastination and a dispute with 
the city over the amount of the tax 
i love and trust him and realize that his lack candor resulted 
from understandable reluctance to admit to his procrastination 
she said in a statement the situation is all the more tragic 
because our income has at all times been more than ample to pay any 
taxes due 
nortons husband edward norton is a lawyer and former chairman 
of the dc board of elections and ethics 
the candidate herself was chief of the us employment 
opportunity commission under president carter 
the disclosure about the unfiled returns follows nortons 
admission friday that she owes about 25000 in city taxes 
she said she and her husband would pay the city 2538190 they 
owed as of jan 18 1990 the sum stems from a protracted dispute 
between the nortons and the city over 10755 in income taxes the 
couple failed to pay in 1982 the additional amount comes from 
interest and penalties

iraqs saddam hussein on saturday urged presidents bush and 
gorbachev on the eve of their summit to get out of the persian gulf 
crisis and let the arab world settle the matter 
a uschartered flight carrying about 300 americans from kuwait 
and iraq meanwhile landed in frankfurt west germany early sunday 
and after refueling was to continue on to charleston sc the 
plane arrived from amman jordan 
saddam in a statement read by an announcer on iraqi television 
and billed as an open message to the us and soviet leaders told 
them i am not saying to either of you what your decision 
should be 
but he said bush and mikhail s gorbachev should bear in mind 
that iraqs army did not invade either of your countries 
saddam whose aug 2 takeover of kuwait set off the chain of 
events leading to the summit in helsinki finland described iraq 
as a peaceloving nation and warned of dangers of the huge usled 
buildup of forces in the gulf region 
god and history are witness that the foreign intervention 
is complicating matters and will not provide a settlement he 
said 
in helsinki bush and gorbachev expressed hopes for a settlement 
to the persian gulf crisis now in its sixth week 
bush told reporters on arrival he hoped the summit would 
strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable act of 
aggression 
the soviet president arriving later cited the acute crisis 
in the gulf i hope this meeting will be successful he said 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft suggested that 
the prospect of ussoviet unity on the persian gulf has saddam on 
the run 
we hope it causes him to lose some sleep scowcroft told 
reporters after a saturday evening working dinner in bushs hotel 
suite 
weve put together a strategy that has a good chance of 
success without the use of military force scowcroft said 
referring to the trade embargo against iraq 
asked whether saddam was backing off scowcroft said i think 
hes maneuvering at present looking for a way out of his 
dilemma 
iraq meanwhile sought to solidify its new rapprochement with 
iran in an effort to get around un economic sanctions 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz is due in tehran on sunday for 
the first highlevel visit in a decade tehrans jomhuri islami 
newspaper said in an editorial that aziz would return to iraq 
with his hands full if iraq continues its conciliatory policy 
toward iran 
this policy has included iraqs withdrawal of troops from 
iranian territory its exchange of war prisoners and its dropping 
of a longstanding demand for full control of a strategic waterway 
in kuwait two more embassies bowed to the pressure brought to 
bear by the iraqi occupiers sweden and norway evacuated their 
diplomatic staffs but insisted their missions technically remained 
open 
the iraqis who ordered embassies in the conquered emirate to 
close two weeks ago have been backing up that demand with a cutoff 
of food water power and telephone service to the missions 
about 20 embassies including the us mission remain open with 
skeleton staffs to symbolize their refusal to accept iraqs 
annexation of kuwait and to try to provide some protection for 
their citizens trapped by the invasion 
about 2200 americans remain in iraq and kuwait us officials 
estimate and some men among them have been placed at important 
installations to deter possible western attacks 
women and children are being allowed to leave 
a uschartered iraqi airways flight from kuwait to amman on 
friday carried 165 americans most of them women and children and 
a few other foreigners a second flight carrying 130 americans 
left kuwait on saturday with a stopover in baghdad us embassy 
sources in amman said 
the entire group was flown to frankfurt early sunday aboard a 
northwest airlines plane and after a brief stopover was to fly on 
to charleston sc 
future charter flights were unlikely to be routed through the 
jordanian capital iraq said saturday that charters would no longer 
fly to amman although they could travel to other points 
that appeared to be acceptable to us officials a state 
department spokesman said on condition of anonymity a 
uschartered flight would leave baghdad on sunday for london 
fridays flight was the first uschartered airlift out of 
kuwait other departing americans have had to make their way out in 
desert convoys 
the norwegian and swedish diplomats who left their embassies in 
kuwait on saturday were traveling overland to baghdad where an 
uncertain fate awaited them it was not clear whether the iraqi 
government would let them leave 
male diplomats and dependents who left the us embassy in 
kuwait have been prevented from leaving 
in cairo egyptian president hosni mubarak met with secretary of 
state james a baker iii and urged the united states and soviet 
union to coordinate their actions in the gulf crisis 
i hope that gorbachev and bush have one line for dealing with 
this problem said the normally circumspect mubarak because it 
will be a hell of a problem in this area if there are differences 
baker said washington and cairo agree that the crisis cannot be 
solved without total iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and restoration 
of the kuwaiti government deposed in the invasion 
about 100000 us troops are dug into the saudi desert and 
aboard ships in the gulf region facing an estimated 260000 iraqi 
soldiers in and around kuwait 
mubarak indicated more egyptian troops would be deployed in the 
gulf region but gave no details 
in other developments 
a columbus ga woman identified her son as the american 
wounded by iraqi troops while trying to avoid capture in kuwait 
the state department had refused to identify the american shot 
thursday mrs cullen hoffman who would not give her first name 
identified the american as her son 33yearold miles hoffman a 
financial analyst and investor for the kuwaiti government she said 
she did not know her sons condition 
one pilot was hospitalized and a second escaped unhurt when a 
us army helicopter crashed during a night training mission us 
military spokesmen said saturday it was the second such crash in 
two days 
in london britains department of trade and industry 
announced it will allow the export of medicine to iraq and kuwait 
a department spokesman said such exports were permitted on 
humanitarian grounds under the un security council resolution 
imposing a trade embargo on iraq and kuwait

president bush and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev held their hastily scheduled summit today 
searching for ways to forge an even closer alliance in the 
international effort to isolate iraqs saddam hussein 
at a break midway through the scheduled five hours of talks 
gorbachev told reporters it was a good conversation 
but the soviet leader refused to divulge details saying they 
would answer questions later at a joint news conference wrapping up 
the oneday summit 
bush too waved off questions as they posed for photos with 
finnish president mauno koivisto and their wives 
you heard what the man said said bush before heading off 
to lunch with their host and his wife 
bush arrived first for the talks at finlands presidential 
palace arranged just eight days ago against the backdrop of the 
gulf crisis it was the third bushgorbachev summit in the past 
nine months 
when gorbachev stepped into the palaces yellow salon bush 
greeted him with a handshake and said how are you sir i look 
forward to the meeting 
gorbachev gave bush a large framed cartoon depicting the two 
leaders as champion boxers with a fallen figure representing the 
cold war at their feet the referees head was a globe the russian 
caption read knockout punch 
bush laughed and said thats wonderful 
a reporter asked the soviet leader in russian if he was 
optimistic yes and tomorrow too replied gorbachev 
the two leaders briefly stepped out onto a balcony behind a 
bulletproof shield drawing applause from a crowd of 300 people 
gathered in market square in front of the palace 
as a light rain fall on the misty morning a woman in the crowd 
sang we shall overcome in english 
much is at stake at sundays hastily arranged summit bush 
said before his third meeting as president with the soviet leader 
iraqs fiveweek occupation of kuwait and its treatment of 
foreign hostages dominated the agenda as the two leaders prepared 
for five hours of facetoface meetings a lunch and a joint news 
conference 
and while neither side gave any indication that a major new 
initiative would emerge both leaders seemed ready to renew 
pressure on saddam to withdraw from kuwait 
white house officials hinted late saturday that the two leaders 
may decide to issue a joint statement on the persian gulf crisis 
several other subjects are likely to be discussed including a 
possible swap of us oildelivery technology for more soviet oil 
and a more sympathetic us ear for western economic aid for moscow 
in saudi arabia a diplomatic source said gorbachev came to 
helsinki prepared to offer the soviet maritime fleet to the united 
states to transport equipment to the gulf and to withdraw soviet 
advisers from iraq 
the monthold us military deployment has been handicapped by 
the lack of sealift for materiel and while the bush administration 
would like to see the soviet advisers pulled out it has been 
lowkey on the issue 
both leaders were upbeat about the session which puts the two 
superpowers on the same side of a major international issue for the 
first time since world war ii 
well be speaking not to some adversary but to the leader of 
a country with whom i think were going to have increasingly 
productive relations bush said on saturday 
gorbachev arriving in the finnish capital saturday evening 
said it was necessary to discuss the acute crisis in the persian 
gulf and a number of other issues 
for gorbachev joining the united states condemnation of iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait and supporting the full naval blockade 
sanction by the united nations is a sensitive matter 
moscow has long been baghdads principal arms supplier and has 
enjoyed a special relationship with the iraqi government gorbachev 
must also be careful not to offend the already restive moslem 
population in central asia 
en route to the summit bush said he did not plan to ask 
gorbachev to contribute ground forces to the usled military 
buildup along iraqs border with saudi arabia even though 
highranking us officials have said such assistance would be 
helpful 
both leaders arrived under overcast skies and received matching 
redcarpet greetings from finnish president mauno koivisto who had 
lunch with bush and dinner with gorbachev 
it was a working summit for both leaders and they did little in 
the way of recreation or sightseeing security was extremely tight 
as always and soviet american and finnish flags were flown 
together crowds lined the streets as the us and soviet 
motorcades passed by and people forked over 20 for tshirts with 
the faces of bush and gorbachev superimposed on that of saddam 
except for a brief stop to shake hands in a downtown helsinki 
market district and a short visit to the us embassy bush spent 
much of his time in his hotel suite meeting with advisers 
white house officials said the administration would have no 
reaction to saddams sixpoint message to both leaders it was not 
clear whether bush watched the address broadcast on cable news 
network and available to him in his hotel suite 
bush was also to meet on sunday with a trade mission of us 
business executives here on their way to moscow 
the two leaders last met in washington in early june their 
first summit was at malta last december

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
possible duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles is 
following the 14 guardsmen as they prepare for deployment overseas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the waning moon is still the brightest 
object in the morning sky as the men from the 265th quartermaster 
detachment turn into the homestretch of their daily run 
the rest of this huge army post just now is shrugging awake 
diesels crank over at the motor pool shouts of other groups doing 
calisthenics come from different directions 
but the 265th a south carolina national guard unit training for 
the mideast is finishing its hour of pt physicial training the 
men have chanted cadence about whiskey women and dying in the drop 
zone now something else is needed to get them back to the barracks 
twosixfive calls the captain leading the heavy breathing 
troop 
twosixfive they answer in unison 
the pace picks up the barracks is a quarter mile away but the 
captain orders a turn and with a chorus of groans the group 
doubles around to pick up stragglers 
more pt some of the men gasp please sir more pt 
like many facets of military training the 6 am run has 
multiple purposes it conditions civilian bodies and minds it 
acclimates men for the desert and it reinforces the idea of unity 
the 265th is a tiny national guard unit from allendale sc 
that specializes in water purification yet over 11 days the group 
has trained for everything but that 
the men whose civilian jobs range from prison guard to college 
student have drilled over and over on radio communications 
weapons chemical warfare and field operations 
these guys are probably going to be far back behind the lines 
but water is one of the most important things over there said 
capt robert appiah the regular army officer supervising the 
265ths training 
that makes them a target and we have to prepare them for 
that he said 
but the constant training and the debilitating heat and humidity 
of southern georgia have taken a toll in the group which has an 
average age of 35 several of the men hobble around with bad knees 
and pulled muscles one went to sick call suffering from mild 
dehydration 
sgt earnest deloach was excused from pt for two weeks to give a 
damaged hamstring time to heal but he was out on the road the next 
morning trying to keep up when he began to fall behind he was 
ordered to drop out 
ill finish it sarge he called he did finish limping 
into the barracks area as the other men were finishing their 
showers 
deloach who has spent 18 of his 38 years in the guard is a 
big jolly man whose tightfitting helmet looks like it was screwed 
onto his head when he laughs which is often his big body shakes 
with mirth when he gets excited or angry his voice climbs several 
octaves 
now a supervisor at the allendale correctional institution 
deloach used to travel the country as a lineman stringing wire for 
power and cable systems 
i quit because i was away from home too much i got tired of 
all that traveling he said now look at me here i go again 
10000 miles 
like the other men deloach tries to balance his duty with the 
problems it causes his personal life like missing his sons 16th 
birthday last week 
during a briefing about conduct for troops in saudi arabia 
someone asks what they can bring back with them from overseas duty 
theres only one damned thing i want to bring home deloach 
said with annoyance thats the head of saddam hussein

gov terry branstad of iowa was asked whether 
president bush and the nations governors had set education goals 
that were impossible to achieve his response a chuckle 
look branstad said what did you want us to say that 
us students will be third fourth or fifth in the world in 
mathematics and science achievement by the year 2000 
the exchange at a recent cbs news education conference reflects 
a growing concern that the goals approved in february after an 
education summit between the president and governors may be a bit 
too lofty 
the goals say that beginning in the year 2000 
all children will start school ready to learn 
high school graduations will increase to at least 90 percent 
students will demonstrate competency over challenging subject 
matter 
students will be first in the world in math and science 
every adult american will be literate 
every school will be free of violence and drugs 
the goals are set against a backdrop of dismal statistics the 
childrens defense fund notes that every eight seconds a student 
drops out every 67 seconds a teenager has a baby every 7 minutes 
a child is arrested for drugs and every year 700000 students 
graduate who cannot read their diplomas 
the issue of having all children come to school ready to learn 
is almost breathtaking in its implications said ernest boyer 
president of the carnegie foundation for the advancement of 
teaching 
he said the concept includes making sure pregnant women receive 
adequate prenatal care and children get good nutrition and health 
care 
if we would deliver on that i am confident all the others 
would fall into place much more completely boyer said he said 
the pledge really brings the issue of commitment to children 
front and center 
asked about the chances of attaining the math goal educator 
marilyn burns of sausalito calif quipped is this a 
probability question what did jimmy the greek give this one 
i do believe this is a window of opportunity said burns 
who has created special math training courses 
i have to believe that futility is better than apathy its 
only going to happen if we make it happen she said it takes 
all of us to save the system 
the education department said 19 percent of all eighth graders 
and 30 percent of hispanics blacks and american indians were not 
proficient in the basic math skills considered necessary to perform 
everyday tasks 
about 12 percent of the 295 million students entering the 
57000 public elementary schools this fall will attend remedial 
reading programs and 6 percent will go to similar programs for 
extra help in math said the national association of elementary 
school principals 
congressional statistics show that fourfifths of elementary 
school mathematics teachers are not fully qualified to teach math 
and twothirds of elementary school science teachers are not fully 
qualified 
a third of american high schools offer no physics course and 
many others offer no chemistry course us high school seniors 
ranked ninth in advanced physics in a survey of 13 countries and 
11th in advanced chemistry american students were last in advanced 
biology 
the science goal was the presidents and governors 
statement said timothy goldsmith biology professor at yale 
university he sought to separate himself from that view but said 
the statement raises questions about the objective of science 
education 
if the task seems gargantuan consider recent history said 
atampt chairman robert e allen a curtain of iron and a wall of 
stone crumbled in the face of an ideal let us keep that picture 
before us for if freedom can topple walls surely a belief in 
children can build effective classrooms 
edward ahnert incoming head of the exxon education foundation 
added that the goal will serve a useful purpose by mobilizing the 
hundreds of thousands of people that its going to require to do 
what we want to do 
if by the year 2000 we have moved from a low ranking up to 
second or third were not no 1 have we failed asked ahnert 
its not getting to be no 1 thats nearly so important as 
getting to be much better than we are 
so if japan or whoever it is is still no 1 and were no 2 
its still a hell of a lot better than being 14th or 15th

high prices for champagne lie ahead as 
farmers prepare to launch the annual grape harvest tuesday 
a dispute between growers and champagne producers ended in april 
with the collapse of a 30year system that fixed an overall price 
for grapes each season the price has since risen by 20 percent to 
about 3 a pound 
there is usually a twoyear gap between the grapes harvest and 
their sale for champagne production but producers say the price of 
a bottle of champagne could rise by 10 percent or more as early as 
january 1991 
last year 249 million bottles of champagne were sold worldwide

mother teresa whose wish to retire was 
rejected by nuns from around the world said sunday her reelection 
as head of her charity was part of gods own plans 
the balloting was to have been a vote to choose a successor to 
the frail 80yearold nun who is known as the saint of the 
gutters for her work with the destitute and the poor 
i was expecting to be free but god has his own plans 
mother teresa said when she met reporters for the first time after 
saturdays election 
the nobel peace prize laureate withdrew her decision to step 
down as superior general of the missionaries of charity after 
ballots were cast by 103 delegates summoned from missions around 
the globe 
calcuttas vicar general monsignor francis gomes who presided 
over the secret balloting said mother teresa had little choice but 
to accept the unanimous vote 
mother teresa said she had been firm on stepping down until 
the balloting forced her to change her decision these things 
cannot be decided beforehand she said 
in march pope john paul ii said he was bowing to mother 
teresas wish to retire from the top post of the order she founded 
he had rejected her earlier requests to step aside 
mother teresa suffered a nearly fatal heart attack a year ago 
she returned to work but asked for retirement within a few months 
asked if she would slow down her pace of work mother teresa 
replied we have sisters who are capable of helping 
but she said she would continue to travel according to the needs 
of her group 
along with mother teresa four aides were elected sister 
fredrick a maltese nun who previously was head of the charitys 
us chapter based in washington was elected as mother teresas 
deputy 
mother teresa was elected to a further sixyear term 
the yugoslavborn roman catholic nun began her work in earnest 
for the poor and helpless 43 years ago in the gutters of calcutta 
indias most densely populated city in the eastern state of west 
bengal 
mother teresa gave up a comfortable teaching job at a catholic 
school to set up a series of homes for the dying in calcutta and 
eventually throughout the world 
today the missionaries of charity operate 430 homes in 95 
countries for lepers cripples abandoned babies and others with no 
place to turn 
mother teresa was awarded the nobel prize in 1979

proponents of legislation to require the us 
auto fleet to average 40 miles per gallon insist they are gaining 
momentum as the persian gulf crisis focuses new attention on the 
nations dependence on foreign oil 
the senate bill which opponents claim could force americans to 
give up the convenience of big cars and minivans is expected to 
reach the senate floor this week it cleared the commerce committee 
on a 144 vote in april 
an environmental lobbyist said supporters are within two or 
three votes of the 60 needed to thwart an expected filibuster he 
said the bill is a weapon to use against iraqi president saddam 
hussein whose invasion of kuwait and threat to saudi oil fields 
precipitated the latest middle east crisis 
its the single biggest step we can take to curb saddam 
husseins power said dan becker of the sierra club if we 
dont need his oil it lowers our stakes in the middle east 
prior to the iraqi invasion the bills primary selling point 
was supporters contention that it would curb carbon dioxide 
emissions which are believed to be a major contributor to global 
warming 
the automobile industry is mounting a fullscale lobbying effort 
against the measure which is sponsored by sen richard bryan 
dnev 
the motor vehicle manufacturers association which represents 
the big three us automakers is purchasing fullpage 
advertisements in major newspapers to argue its case 
an industry spokesman acknowledged that the job of defeating the 
bill in the senate already difficult had become tougher since 
iraq invaded kuwait last month prompting a united nations economic 
boycott and deployment of us troops to saudi arabia 
its going to be tough because there is an effort to portray 
the bryan bill as a positive reaction to the middle east 
situation said tim mccarthy of the manufacturers group 
but he said prospects of the bill getting through the house are 
slim even if it passes the senate and he noted that the bush 
administration strongly opposes the measure the administration has 
urged motorists to drive the speed limit and keep their tires 
properly inflated to save fuel 
congress established fuel economy standards in 1975 in response 
to the 1973 arab oil embargo at that time the average usmade 
car got 12 mpg 
under current law new car fleets all the cars a company 
manufactures in a given year must get an overall average of at 
least 275 miles per gallon 
the bryan bill would require each manufacturer to improve its 
corporate average fuel economy or cafe 20 percent by 1995 and 40 
percent by 2001 the overall fleet average would be about 344 mpg 
in 1995 and 402 mpg by 2001 bryan says 
this higher cafe can save us 28 million barrels of oil a 
day bryan said friday 
half of the nations oil consumption 169 million barrels a 
day is imported about 63 percent of the nations oil goes to 
transportation mainly the 180 million cars trucks and buses on 
us highways 
automakers say the bryan bill would have no impact on the 
current crisis because the fuel savings would not materialize for 
10 years to 15 years 
fuel efficiency has doubled since the 1970s partly because the 
average cars weight fell from 4000 pounds to 3000 pounds 
mccarthy said the bryan bills standards are not technologically 
feasible without another round of downsizing which would 
eliminate many larger models he said 
youre talking about an absolutely drastic change in the 
models available to the public mccarthy said station wagons and 
minivans popular with families could disappear from showrooms he 
said 
bryan said automakers had equally dire warnings in the 1970s 
but managed to meet the standards 
sens donald riegle dmich and don nickles rokla will 
lead the opposition during debate which could begin this week 
congressional sources said the bill was among several that majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine hoped to bring to the floor 
riegle served notice of a likely filibuster friday by filing an 
objection to waiving the customary twoday waiting period before 
voting to halt debate

americas buildup in the persian gulf has 
given added impetus to proponents of a postcold war defense budget 
that favors oldfashioned conventional weapons over sophisticated 
strategic hardware 
the house of representatives takes up the fiscal 1991 defense 
bill monday working from a 283 billion blueprint drawn up prior 
to iraqs aug 3 invasion of kuwait 
deterring iraqi aggression and its cost were not a direct 
consideration when the house armed services committee drew up the 
plan 
but some lawmakers say all the same that the measure is geared 
to equipping us forces for a desert conflict rather than a 
european showdown 
the bill better addresses these types of contingencies said 
rep dave mccurdy dokla a senior member of the house armed 
services committee 
the summit meeting between president bush and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev drove home what had already been seen as a 
diminished soviet threat both leaders expressed confidence that 
the two superpowers could agree on a treaty to slash nuclear arms 
by the end of the year 
responding to improved climate before the helsinki summit the 
armed services bill slashed 24 billion from president bushs 
original request of 307 billion for fiscal 1991 
among the budget targets were the b2 stealth bomber the 
strategic defense initiative and two landbased nuclear missiles 
among the programs given a second chance were the m1 tank f15 
jet fighter and v22 osprey helicopter 
the estimated 1 billion a month cost of operation desert shield 
could change the amount eventually approved by the house and any 
deficit reduction agreement between congressional and white house 
negotiators could do the same 
a package covering some of the cost of desert shield will be 
presented to the armed services committee on wednesday and taken up 
by the full house the same day 
even if a socalled iraqi addon is adopted the house bill 
will differ in detail from the legislation approved by the senate 
last month 
the senate measure calls for 289 billion in defense spending 
and leaves intact bushs request for the b2 bomber but it slashes 
1 billion from his proposal for sdi 
the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee 
sen john warner of virginia said in an interview last week that 
289 billion is the lowest the defense budget can go 
senator nunn and i are firmly together the senate numbers on 
defense are the bare minimum warner said referring to the 
committees chairman sam nunn dga 
the senate adopted its defense bill shortly after iraqi troops 
invaded kuwait and many lawmakers cautioned against deep cuts in 
light of the events in the middle east 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas summed up the 
argument saying iraqi president saddam hussein has provided a 
wakeup call 
the senate reaction was duly noted by a liberal democrat on the 
house armed services committee rep patricia schroeder of colorado 
im hoping that time and reflection wont allow that same 
stampede here schroeder said in an interview last week 
sen william cohen rmaine says the iraqi aggression will 
temper the widespread calls for significant cuts in the defense 
budget but not prevent military reductions 
i think it will slow it down somewhat but there will be cuts 
and well still look at the kind of strategic systems like the b2 
mx railgarrison that we have proposed eliminating cohen said on 
returning from a congressional trip to the middle east 
the house armed services legislation would limit production of 
the b2 stealth bomber to the 15 planes already under construction 
the air force believes the radarevading plane is ideal for 
locating targets in the soviet union but lawmakers have winced at 
the bombers cost of nearly 865 million per plane 
the committee also stripped nearly 2 billion from bushs 
request of 47 billion for the strategic defense initiative cut 
military personnel by 129500 and scaled back on two nuclear 
missile programs 
it also rejected defense secretary dick cheneys second attempt 
in two years to kill the v22 osprey the tiltrotor aircraft the 
marine corps envisions as a futuristic transport vehicle 
the panel also added money for programs that the defense 
department and bush did not want coming under attack from some 
republicans for porkbarrel spending 
among the additions are 150 million for m1 tank modifications 
and 100 million for f15 fighters 
some democrats perceive those additions as necessary for a 
military that is more likely to face iraq than the soviet union

the soviet union has been iraqs main arms 
supplier for more than two decades but middle east experts say 
relations between moscow and its persian gulf client cooled in 
recent years as iraq looked to the west for technology 
moscows decision to condemn the iraqi occupation of kuwait and 
its support for united nations economic sanctions against baghdad 
is a major blow to saddam hussein but its not the first sign of 
change in iraqisoviet relations 
it already was changing said robert neumann a former us 
ambassador to saudi arabia and other middle eastern nations 
neumann said iraq began turning toward the west especially 
france in the early 1980s this followed iraqs condemnation of 
the december 1979 soviet invasion of predominantly muslim 
afghanistan and the start of iraqs eightyear war with iran 
iraq also has been irritated by soviet support for syria an 
arch enemy of iraq 
signs of the strained relationship were evident sunday when 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said iraq was asking for 
trouble by refusing to withdraw from kuwait 
what the present iraqi leadership is doing is driving it into 
a dead end and i hope president saddam hussein will heed this 
appeal to him gorbachev told a news conference at the conclusion 
of his summit with president bush in helsinki finland 
moscow halted arms sales to iraq after the invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 up to then it ranked as baghdads main arms supplier 
moscow sold iraq 23 billion in weapons between 1982 and 1989 or 
about 55 percent of total iraqi arms purchases in that period 
according to the congressional research service 
last year iraq began building sovietdesigned t72 main battle 
tanks which it previously had purchased directly from moscow the 
soviets sold hundreds of the tanks to iraq during the gulf war and 
they were a key factor in a string of iraqi military victories that 
forced iran to accept a ceasefire that took effect in august 1988 
also in iraqs arsenal are sovietmade mig29 fighter jets 
sukhoi su24 and su25 fighterbombers and tu22 blinder bombers 
iraq also has an undetermined number of sovietmade ss12 
scaleboard mobile ballistic missiles as well as shorterrange 
scudb missiles 
some american analysts believe moscow is playing a double 
game of giving the appearance of cooperating with the west in 
trying to push saddam out of kuwait while at the same time 
preserving its relations with its longtime ally 
the soviet union has provided iraq with tangible and 
invaluable diplomatic support even as it seeks to promote the 
perception that moscow is sorely chagrined with saddam hussein 
said frank j gaffney jr director of the center for security 
policy a washington think tank 
gaffney said cooperation between moscow and baghdad also extends 
to intelligence gathering 
it is only reasonable to presume that this cooperation now 
involves the provision to baghdad of vital strategic warning and 
tactical information about the multinational force arrayed against 
iraq a capability which iraq basically lacks he said friday 
on thursday the iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz said in 
moscow after meeting with gorbachev that he appreciated the 
soviets willingness to listen to his countrys grievances even 
though gorbachev still insisted iraq withdraw from kuwait 
i without hesitation can still call the soviets our friends 
despite the differences between us aziz told reporters 
saddam took a tougher tone on saturday in a public message to 
gorbachev and bush on the eve of their helsinki meeting the iraqi 
leader suggested the outcome of the meeting would determine whether 
moscow was finished as a superpower 
he who represents the soviet union should remember that doubts 
about the place of the soviet union as a superpower have gotten 
into the mind of every politician for some time especially as the 
us began to assume to be the sole power in the world saddam 
said 
soviet advisers in iraq estimated to number about 1000 are 
believed to have helped train soldiers in the use and maintenance 
of sovietmade weaponry 
gorbachev said sunday that only 196 of those advisers were 
involved in military matters he said their number had dropped to 
150 and that all eventually would leave iraq 
iraq began building relations with the soviet union after a 1958 
coup that toppled the iraqi monarchy and established a modern 
republic in april 1972 iraq signed a 20year treaty of friendship 
and cooperation with moscow the pact called for cooperation in 
military political economic and social matters and was similar to 
a treaty the soviets had with egypt before president anwar sadat 
expelled thousands of soviet advisers and repudiated the pact

hightech finland a model of 
efficiency and electronic knowhow was an ideal choice to stage a 
complicated superpower summit on a weeks notice 
there wasnt much time but we can handle it president 
mauno koivisto said calmly a few days before the sudden summit 
meeting between presidents bush and mikhail gorbachev 
and he was right though bush and gorbachev struggled at times 
with the sound system at their endofsummit news conference 
we have had a lot of big events not as big as this of course 
so we were confident we would be able to build this in such a 
short time said christer hagglund who supervised installation 
of telephones electric typewriters computer terminals and 
transmission facilities for 2160 journalists from all over the 
world 
our telephone network is very efficient he said 
one radio journalist from washington agreed is this a 
cellular phone this town has the greatest toys he exclaimed 
holding a tiny lightweight mobile telephone that isnt available 
in the united states yet 
the finnish company nokia produces 14 per cent of the worlds 
cellular phones the largest share of any company in the world 
gorbachev was astounded by a nokia product during his state 
visit to helsinki last october he was handed one of the 
sixinchlong phones with a short aerial and told to listen 
someone he knew in moscow spoke to him through the phone and 
photographers registered gorbachevs disbelief 
finnish technology has also produced thermal suits which protect 
humans at subzero temperatures the artificial sweetener xylitol 
the antiviral protein interferon and a fiveyear contraceptive 
coil without the adverse side effects of other intrauterine devices 
while a few lapps in the north still live a nomadic life using 
reindeer for meat for clothing and for bearing their belongings 
most finns are city dwellers in the south and the nation boasts one 
of the worlds highest standards of living 
the national school system reaches the lapps too and finland 
claims nearly 100 per cent of its population can read and write 
at least 17 percent of the governments budget is allocated to 
education science research and culture including funds from 
private industry more than half of all finnish research money goes 
to technology 
sixty percent of all working icebreakers were made in finland 
where onethird of the land mass is above the arctic circle the 
country has over 100000 lakes and its finnish name suomi is 
believed to be based on the word for swamp 
finland is a particular leader in forestry and agricultural 
developments more than half its 135200 square miles are covered 
with forest 
metal and forest products are finlands main exports and it is 
the worlds second largest exporter of paper 
although finns have all the modern conveniences the latest 
technology and styles they pay a lot for it 
the modern railroad highway and telephone networks are 
expensive to maintain because of the great distances involved even 
though 60 per cent of the 5 million people live in urban areas the 
low population representing a small market for massproduced 
products makes prices higher 
cars are taxed at 130 per cent of their value to justify the 
cost in foreign currency of getting them and their parts to 
consumers a radio priced at the equivalent of 600 in helsinki 
could be bought for 100 at a discount warehouse in new york 
finns also pay high taxes from 30 percent to 60 percent of 
their income and 17 percent in sales taxes

university library pored over ancient books manuscripts and 
maps including the oldest known moscow city map and an early 
american map showing california as an island 
mrs bush wore a royal blue dress while mrs gorbachev was 
wearing a severe gray suit and a violet blouse appearing less 
stylish than she has on previous visits to the west she has drawn 
criticism in the soviet union for her fashionable attire

stack of books including the most complete collection of russian 
works in western europe

the 1538 map although hakli told reporters it shows only the 
moscow river and a few other details and you wouldnt find your

russia on a map saying of her ethnically diverse homeland we 
are one russia not asian russia and european russia 
helsinki university library as finlands national library

because efforts failed to turn it into a museum 
its almost a lost cause said steele taylor chairman of 
the grand rapids arts and museum commission we cant get anybody 
interested in fixing it up 
the federal veterans administration acquired the fourbedroom 
house in 1972 when the owner defaulted three years later after 
ford became president the va donated it to the city 
the commission had trouble raising the estimated 51000 to 
renovate the home into a museum because ford lived in at least 
eight homes in grand rapids said jim kratsas curator of the 
gerald r ford museum 
city records show ford lived in the white twostory house from 
1923 to 1930 from the time he was 10 years old through his junior 
year at the grand rapids south high school 
in a 1989 letter to museum director timothy chester ford wrote 
i have no objection to in fact i endorse the sale 
museum officials have asked the citys historic preservation 
commission to designate the house as a historic landmark to protect 
it from demolition 
helena jones 86 who has lived next door to the ford house for 
20 years said sentimentality aside she hopes the house gets sold 
he wasnt president that long jones said weve got 
enough things named after ford

the four warring factions in cambodia 
appear ready to accept a un peace plan to end their 11yearold 
war indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said sunday 
we are encouraged by the fact that the four factions have 
indicated they can accept the document as the basis for settling 
the cambodian conflict the foreign minister said after the 
opening session of peace talks in the indonesian capital 
alatas said the circumstances for achieving a comprehensive 
settlement are unlikely ever again to be as favorable as they are 
now 
the guerrillas and cambodias vietnambacked government had no 
immediate comment 
the talks originally scheduled to open wednesday were delayed 
because key leaders threatened to stay away unless their 
counterparts attended 
the talks were focusing on a plan backed by the five permanent 
members of the un security council the united states soviet 
union china britain and france to end cambodias civil war 
the plan envisions the formation of a transitional council on 
which each of the four cambodian factions would be represented 
the socalled supreme national council would cede much of its 
authority to the united nations whose representatives would 
administer the country until free elections could be held the plan 
also calls for disarming and regrouping the four armies 
earlier meetings in indonesia and elsewhere since july 1988 
ended inconclusively when the four factions disagreed on how to 
share power in the period before elections 
premier hun sen of the vietnaminstalled government in phnom 
penh has accepted the un plan not only as the agenda of the 
meeting but also as the framework of the solution 
the threeparty guerrilla resistance coalition also accepts the 
un proposal it was represented sunday by khieu samphan nominal 
leader of the communist khmer rouge former cambodian premier son 
sann who heads the anticommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation front and prince norodom ranariddh who represents the 
faction of his father prince norodom sihanouk he said he was ill 
and could not attend 
the indonesian foreign minister and a french foreign ministry 
official edwige avice were leading the talks 
the main idea for us for the permanent five is an enhanced 
intervention of the united nations in order to create a neutral 
political environment allowing the cambodian people to decide 
freely on its future by free and fair elections ms avice said 
sihanouk has said the guerrilla coalition would allow the phnom 
penh government half the seats on the proposed 12member council 
with the other six seats to be divided equally among the three 
guerrilla groups however he said the councils decisions should 
be made by consensus rather than majority vote 
he also said the council should be formed before the start of 
the un general assembly session later this month so its 
representative could take cambodias seat in the world body which 
is now held by the guerrilla coalition he said china supported his 
proposals 
the guerrilla coalitions noncommunist resistance forces are 
backed by washington china backs the khmer rouge 
the guerrilla coalition is battling the government vietnam 
installed in phnom penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled 
the khmer rouge who had during their nearly fouryear rule tried 
to transform cambodia into a radical agrarian society their 
program resulted in the deaths of nearly 1 million people

camps in sidon and the rest of south lebanon younis awad a 
senior aide to plo chairman yasser arafat said in the ein 
elhilweh shantytown site of the 12hour battle in the tunnels

in majdalyoun a main training base and weapons depot for abu 
nidals group the village is about five miles east of sidon 
its a fortress up there it will take the plo quite a while 
to get them out said a police spokesman who cannot be identified 
under briefing regulations 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna broke away from 
the plo in 1973 and was sentenced to death in absentia by a plo 
tribunal for killing arafat aides 
abu nidals group has been torn by internal feuds in recent 
months scores of men have been killed and some of abu nidals top 
aides defected with their followers 
abu nidal is sought by the united states and some western 
european nations for terrorist attacks over the last 15 years 
including massacres at the rome and vienna airports in december 
1985 that killed a total of 20 people 
he is also wanted in connection with the hijacking of a pan 
american world airways jet in karachi pakistan in september 1986 
twenty passengers were killed and 120 wounded 
security sources say abu nidals faction has increasingly been 
allied with the syrians who have about 40000 troops in lebanon 
police officials speaking on condition of anonymity predict 
that the plo victory in south lebanon could trigger retaliation by 
abu nidal loyalists 
were going to see a wave of assassinations bombings and 
kidnappings against arafats men one official commented 
arafat reportedly has about 5000 guerrillas in south lebanon 
in sidon a general strike was called sunday to protest the 
violence the city of 350000 people has been ravaged by fires

mikhail gorbachev won hints of more 
economic aid from president bush on sunday but rebuffed suggestions 
that moscow would play a global second fiddle to washington 
it would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge 
that the soviet union could be bought for dollars gorbachev told 
a joint news conference with the us president at the close of 
their oneday summit 
the soviet and us leaders pledged to work closely in using 
commercial and diplomatic pressure to force iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait but gorbachev stressed he was not following the us lead 
in order to win american aid 
we do not want to get caught up in a debate about prestige 
he said when asked to respond to iraq leader saddam husseins 
challenge for moscow to defy us will in the middle east in order 
to prove that it was still a superpower 
no single country however powerful will be able to provide 
the leadership which individual countries formerly tried to 
provide including some countries which are represented here he 
said 
gorbachev and his entourage departed for moscow sunday night 
during the seven hours of summit talks the soviet leader again 
balked at sending troops or warships to bolster us forces 
implementing a united nations embargo against iraq 
gorbachev won a pledge from bush that us troops would withdraw 
from the arabian peninsula at the close of the crisis and the 
soviet leader announced that about 150 soviet military experts 
remained in iraq down from 196 at the beginning of the crisis 
they are leaving iraq and the process is moving forward so i 
dont think its a problem he said there had been speculation 
he might agree to withdraw all the experts 
bush said the presence of the advisers was not a major 
irritant but that there removal would facilitate 
understanding in the united states of the soviet position 
bush said that he had asked gorbachev neither to send a special 
message to hussein a former soviet client nor to dispatch 
troops or naval vessels to join us forces implementing us 
sanctions against iraq 
i did not ask him to send troops in bush said if the 
soviet union wants to send troops in at the invitation of the 
saudis that would be fine with me 
gorbachev stressed his desire for a political rather than a 
military solution to the crisis and bush acknowledged that some 
differences remain in the advisability of using force 
bush did not spell out any concrete steps the us government 
might take to prop up the failing economy of the soviet union 
where shortages of bread and other staples were spreading 
but the us president did he say he wanted to bolster radical 
reform policies that are now under debate in the soviet union 
we for course want perestroika to succeed bush said i 
think that this remarkable cooperation that has been demonstrated 
by the soviet union at the united nations gets me inclined to 
recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible 
and i will be saying this to the congress when i get back he 
said 
bush and key members of the senate say they will push for 
ratification of a bilateral trade agreement and favorable tariffs 
for the soviet union once that nations parliament codifies recent 
liberalizations in emigration policy 
bush also noted that he was sending commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher to moscow this week with a team of us businessmen to 
encourage economic cooperation in as many ways as possible 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters that the 
two leaders discussed cooperation in developing energy resources 
but he did not go as far as bush did on saturday saying he might 
be willing to trade us technology for soviet oil the soviet 
union is the worlds largest oil producer 
gorbachev won from bush a renewed pledge that the united states 
does not intend to maintain a permanent military base in saudi 
arabia 1000 miles from southern soviet borders 
bush said us forces would stay in the region as long as 
needed but the sooner they are out of there as far as im 
concerned the better we have no intention of keeping them 
there a day longer than required

a large bloc of undecided voters and the 
prospects of a low turnout raised evan mechams hopes for an upset 
in arizonas republican gubernatorial contest one of 11 primaries 
tuesday that will complete the general election lineups for all but 
a handful of states 
candidates spent heavily to get their messages on television 
but they were competing for attention with a ussoviet summit and 
the military crisis in the persian gulf 
an election official in arizona predicted that fewer than 40 
percent of the states republican voters would cast ballots in the 
hotly contested primary between mecham whose tumultuous service as 
governor ended in 1988 with his impeachment developer fife 
symington and three other contenders 
former phoenix mayor terry goddard was heavily favored in the 
democratic gubernatorial primary and was expected to enter the 
general election as the frontrunner to succeed gov rose mofford 
a democrat who is retiring 
a low turnout also was forecast in minnesota where democratic 
gov rudy perpich was battling a strong primary challenge from 
former state commerce commissioner mike hatch 
there was a hotly contested gop primary in minnesota as well 
state auditor arne carlson businessman jon grunseth and former 
prosecutor doug kelley were competing for the gop nod carlson 
surprised party leaders by jumping to a healthy lead in the polls 
over grunseth who had the organization endorsement 
the other states holding primaries on tuesday were connecticut 
maryland new hampshire new york rhode island utah vermont and 
wisconsin after tuesdays round of primaries the only states left 
to choose nominees will be massachusetts washington oklahoma 
florida and louisiana 
in the district of columbia voters were choosing nominees to 
succeed mayor marion barry whose plans to seek reelection were 
sidetracked after his indictment on cocaine possession charges 
also on the ballot in the nations capital was jesse jackson 
the twotime candidate for the democratic presidential nomination 
was expected to win nomination easily for the symbolic office of 
shadow senator a position created to press the citys campaign 
for statehood 
mecham wasnt the only politician seeking to regain an office he 
once held 
richard snelling had only minor opposition to his bid for the 
gop nomination for governor of vermont an office he gave up in 
1984 after serving four twoyear terms his successor democrat 
madeleine kunin is retiring 
former sen john durkin defeated for reelection in 1980 is 
competing with nashua mayor james donchess and businessman john 
rauh in the new hampshire democratic senate primary republican 
rep bob smith was heavily favored in the gop primary for the seat 
now held by republican sen gordon humphrey who is retiring 
another 1980 democratic casualty former rep edward beard of 
rhode island is trying to regain his old house seat but is locked 
in a tough primary with state sen john f reed 
one house member in serious danger of being denied renomination 
was rep roy dyson dmd state legislator barbara kreamer was 
benefiting from the disclosure that the hawkish dyson was a 
conscientious objector during the vietnam war 
several house members also faced primary challenges on tuesday 
but none was seen as in serious danger 
other contests being settled include a threeway race for the 
democratic nomination to challenge republican gov edward diprete 
of rhode island and a twoway fight for the democratic nomination 
for governor connecticut 
the democratic and gop nominees for governor of connecticut 
enter the general election race as underdogs to former republican 
sen lowell weicker who is running as an independent 
in arizona preelection polls found more than 40 percent of 
potential gop primary voters saying they remain undecided in the 
race for governor 
observers speculate that mechams supporters tend to be the most 
likely to refuse to state their preference when questioned by 
pollsters the prospects for a low turnout also was considered a 
plus for the former governor 
if the turnout is under 35 percent mecham could win it 
said bruce merrill director of the media research center at 
arizona state university 
voters may be confused mecham said friday after the last 
public debate in the fiveway gop primary for governor theyve 
listened and been disappointed so very often by politicians 
secretary of state jim shumway a democrat whose office handles 
state elections predicts a 38 percent gop turnout but admits im 
being optimistic 
the turnout is likely to be much higher perhaps as much as 60 
percent in rural areas where mecham has fared well in five 
previous tries for governor but where there are relatively few 
voters 
mecham himself has been the hottest issues in the gop primary 
he was removed from office in april 1988 after his conviction in an 
impeachment trial on charges he misused money from supporters and 
also interfered with a police investigation of an alleged death 
threat by one of his aides 
during the current campaign symington has referred to mechams 
tenure as a period in which the state was the object of national 
derision 
equally controversial were mechams positions on such issues as 
gay rights and a state holiday commemorating slain civil rights 
leader martin luther king 
mechams hardcore support shrank to about 15 percent or 20 
percent of the gop after his impeachment but his supporters are 
fiercely loyal vote in large numbers and could triumph if the 
antimecham vote is split between the other four candidates 
three other gop candidates sam steiger fred koory and bob 
barnes contend that nomination of either mecham or symington would 
split the party and assure the election of goddard

an appellate court could stop the 
highstepping tennessee walking horses in their tracks if it 
upholds a ban on the braceletlike chains that trainers use to 
produce the animals distinctive gait 
the american horse protection association argues the use of the 
chains causes pain and swelling in the horses forelegs and should 
be banned 
lawyers for the walking horse industry and the us department 
of agriculture on tuesday will ask the us court of appeals for 
the district of columbia to overrule a lower court ruling that 
overturned usda rules and banned use of the chains 
the ahpas position is that its no coincidence soring is a 
particular problem in the walking horse industry and the walking 
horse industry is the only breed which allows chains in the show 
ring russell gaspar general counsel for the association said 
last week 
trainers say the exaggerated gait is what thrills people like 
the nearly 250000 spectators who came to shelbyville tenn last 
month during the 10day tennessee walking horse national 
celebration the crown jewel of walking horse shows 
they argue the exaggerated big lick gait cant be achieved 
without the 6ounce chains which trainers say dont hurt the horse 
i love these horses they are my whole life said trainer 
gary edwards of dawson ga id love to think half of the kids in 
the us get the treatment our horses get 
the chains just make the horse want to step out of them 
which produces the highstep headshaking walk which makes the 
horses so distinctive edwards said 
ph buddy payne executive director of the walking horse 
breeders and exhibitors association said the ahpa itself admits 
that chains alone dont cause sores and he said the breeders 
association will argue that us district judge oliver gausch had 
no authority to order the ban 
the usda adminsters the horse protection act of 1970 which 
prohibits the practice of soring horses by using cruel methods 
devices or chemicals to cause horses pain while walking an issue 
in the lawsuit is whether the use of chains is in itself cruel 
at present the usda allows chains on the theory that if the 
chains are used on sore horses in the show ring or if chemicals 
are placed on the chains to irritate the horses skin federal 
inspectors will catch the violation and fine the offender 
payne said those rules are fair and equitable to everyone 
and were written after usda officials considered hundreds of 
written comments and evidence on chains 
but gaspar said gausch was correct in ruling that the usda never 
resolved the issue of soring practices 
there is a substantial body of evidence that usda inspectors 
are not catching all the sore horses gaspar said he said chains 
combined with chemical irritants create the exaggerated gait by 
hurting the horse 
gaspar said some believe horses can be taught the gait without 
the chains although edwards disagreed 
the key is it has to be a talented horse gaspar said 
its been shown that the reason that soring is practiced is to 
take a horse of modest talents and make them perform better as 
well as to train a horse to do the big lick show gait faster 
edwards said an outright ban on chains would destroy the 
industry 
were not selling horses like weve been selling them not 
getting new people into showing he said who wants to invest 
their savings in something that six months from now might not be 
worth a tenth what you paid for it 
a spokeswoman for the international arabian horse association in 
denver says the whole horse industry is shifting to the amateur 
rider 
the entire industry is experiencing an economic slump because 
horses are a luxury item said jane greer public relations 
director for the arabian association i dont know whether the 
chains hurt the horse or not but i dont think it would be the 
death knell for the industry

the isle of tears cracked a smile sunday as 
immigrants old and new celebrated the reopening of ellis island 
gateway to the new world for the ancestors of two out of five 
americans 
there are thousands of different names thousands of different 
stories but you stitch all of them together and you have one huge 
saga and its our saga said chrysler chairman lee iacocca who 
spearheaded the campaign that raised 156 million to restore the 
90yearold immigration station 
before snipping a white ribbon vice president dan quayle linked 
the nations immigrant history to the crisis in the persian gulf 
there he said children of mexicans or kenyans stand shoulder to 
shoulder with the grandchildren of japanese or french next to the 
greatgrandchildren of poles or dutch now americans all 
what we celebrate in ellis island is nothing less than the 
triumph of the american spirit quayle said we may all know in 
our minds that time and time again it has been the immigrant who 
has renewed and rekindled the american spirit but here in ellis 
island we feel it in our hearts 
about 2500 guests gathered outside the huge fourtowered brick 
building that reopens to the public monday as a museum and memorial 
following six years of work 
the restoration project the most expensive of its kind in 
american history was entirely financed by private contributions to 
the statue of libertyellis island foundation 
fortynine new citizens including three children were sworn in 
by supreme court justice antonin scalia and six people who entered 
the nation through ellis in the first quarter of the century were 
singled out to represent the millions of immigrants who passed 
through the island 
they included johanna flaherty 84 who said she left her native 
ireland in 1923 because she didnt want to wake up and stare a 
cow in the face every morning another was clara larsen who came 
from russia in 1913 because she wanted to get an education 
in russia the jewish kids didnt stand a chance she 
recalled they didnt accept them in the public schools she 
went on to become an early leader of the international ladies 
garment workers union 
immigrants contributions were celebrated throughout the 
program down to the music the us army band played selections by 
irving berlin who came through ellis as a child 
iacocca dedicated the american immigrant wall of honor which 
bears the names of about 2000 immigrants whose descendants donated 
100 or more to the renovation effort the names are inscribed on a 
long copper strip on the islands seawall about 400 yards from the 
statue of liberty 
one of the names was that of antonio macchiarola 80 of 
johnston ri who arrived at age 11 
in retrospect macchiarola said it all seems like a 
pilgrimage i was just a little bit of a kid and i had to go 
through these lines to be examined everybody was afraid they 
wouldnt make it 
macchiarola did like 98 percent of those who landed at ellis 
but for those who were turned back including a little girl who 
traveled with his family and was rejected because of eye disease 
ellis was called the isle of tears 
the federal government bought the 275acre island in the late 
1800s for about 10000 from the descendants of a man named samuel 
ellis it opened the first immigration station on the island in 
1892 but the building burned down five years later 
its replacement was finished in 1900 a building designed to 
impress immigrants with its ornate copper domes vast windows and 
vaulted ceilings 
between 1892 and 1924 when ellis was the nations busiest port 
of entry an average of 5000 people a day passed through on the 
busiest day april 17 1907 11747 immigrants were processed

president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev pledged sunday to speed up arms control 
negotiations hoping for agreement by years end to slash both 
nuclear and nonnuclear weapons 
but the leaders wrapping up their oneday summit gave no clues 
on whether either side had put forth fresh proposals that would 
advance the twin sets of talks 
secretary of state james a baker iii later raised the 
possibility that negotiators might drop the contentious issue of 
placing limits on combat aircraft to win early agreement on cutting 
conventional weapons in europe 
theres quite a bit of difference between us still on 
aircraft and it may be that well have to proceed with 
everything we can do and save aircraft for a later time 
baker said in an interview on cable news networks newsmaker sunday 
program 
but he said no final decision has yet been made 
the issue of aircraft ceilings is the most difficult for 
eastwest negotiators bargaining on a treaty to slash troops tanks 
and other conventional or nonnuclear arms in europe 
at a joint news conference bush said he and gorbachev vowed 
that we would encourage our negotiators to move forward more 
rapidly on both the strategic arms treaty and the conventional 
force agreement 
gorbachev added that the officials agreed they would make 
fresh efforts to give further instructions to their bargainers 
both said they were hopeful agreement could be reached by the 
end of the year but others have said the slow pace of the 
negotiations has raised concern the deadline could be missed 
baker said the leaders stressed the importance of gaining a 
conventional arms treaty before the opening of a 35nation summit 
of the conference on security and cooperation in europe french 
officials already have begun plans to hold the gathering nov 1921 
in paris 
bush has said he will not attend the summit unless the treaty is 
wrapped up by then 
the second set of negotiations designed to win a strategic arms 
reduction treaty would slash the superpowers holdings of 
longrange nuclear weapons by about 30 percent it would be the 
firstever negotiated cut in this category of weapons 
the conventional forces in europe talks have been on a fast 
track since they opened in march 1989 between negotiators for the 
16 nations of the north atlantic treaty organization and the seven 
of the sovietled warsaw pact 
they were designed to bring both sides to equal ceilings in main 
battle tanks armored combat vehicles artillery troops combat 
aircraft and attack helicopters the wests aim is to cripple the 
soviets ability to mount a lightning attack on european countries 
negotiators for the 23 nations have reached agreement on 
numerical ceilings and definitions for equipment covered in only 
two areas main battle tanks and armored combat vehicles they are 
considered close on artillery and not too far apart on attack 
helicopters 
but they have made little headway in their talks on reducing 
combat aircraft because of sharp differences over what should be 
covered in that category 
the united states wants to include in the count planes that are 
based on land but are used in naval operations the kremlin has 
said no it has offered proposals that would exempt large numbers 
of landbased naval planes from the accord 
baker said the united states was not willing to put off the 
aircraft issue unless its nato allies agreed 
if they would join in we would have to give some 
consideration to that because we think its important to lock in 
the other elements of the treaty he told the cnn interviewers 
the arms bargaining also has snagged over reductions in troops 
in europe 
moscow and washington settled on a plan earlier this year to 
trim their forces to 195000 for each side in central europe with 
the united states retaining an additional 30000 in britain and 
southern europe 
but it is unclear whether that accord still holds 
a nato official speaking in advance of the weekend summit said 
the soviets have said the upheavals in eastern europe have made the 
troop caps outdated with the diminished military threat the 
number of soldiers stationed in central europe by the superpowers 
might well be below those limits 
during the summer the soviets mentioned a possible ceiling of 
70000 to 80000 soldiers for each superpower in europe said the 
official who demanded anonymity but they recently renewed their 
interest in the earlier cap of 195000 troops 
they have put up so many proposals now that were uncertain 
what one they really want said a western diplomat in vienna 
where the negotiations are being held 
the two sides so far have agreed to limit main battle tanks to 
20000 for each side a cap that will require the soviet union to 
get rid of tens of thousands of the heavy giants in europe 
they also have decided to cap armored combat vehicles at 30000 
on each side

the discovery of a clandestine 
mass grave containing more than 1700 bodies some apparently of 
political opponents of brazils former military rulers has stirred 
many painful memories 
although an amnesty passed by the former military dictatorship 
bars trying anyone for involvment in the deaths activists are 
demanding a full investigation 
the construction of a state of law and democracy demands the 
truth is fully told said a statement issued last week by two 
human rights groups 
this necessity is even greater in brazil because the amnesty 
eliminated the possibility that those responsible for torture and 
assassinations would be held accountable for their actions the 
statement said 
the grave discovered tuesday in perus on the outskirts of sao 
paulo contained mostly the remains of paupers but an estimated 50 
of the dead are believed to be former enemies of the military 
government that ruled from 1964 to 1985 
some of the skeletons unearthed had damaged skulls from gunshot 
wounds to the head and human rights officials say the people were 
summarily executed a pacemaker and platinum dental work also 
indicated that not all the remains were those of paupers 
sao paulo mayor luiza erundina said records at three other city 
graveyards would be checked this week to see if other military 
enemies were buried there 
unlike some south american countries brazil never fully 
investigated human rights abuses that occurred under military rule 
in argentina a full public accounting of the crimes of the 
19761982 dictatorship took place five former junta members later 
were found guilty of murder and human rights violations 
uruguay returned to civilian rule in 1985 after nine years of 
military dictatorship a nationwide referendum was held there on 
revoking the militarys selfapproved amnesty and after much 
public debate the amnesty was narrowly upheld 
brazils dictatorship was not as brutal as some in the region 
but it systematically violated human rights rights groups say 
about 200 people were killed in brazil 150 disappeared and 
thousands were tortured 
many people with leftist sympathies were exiled 
however a key to the 1985 return of civilian rule which was 
negotiated among the generals and civilian politicians was the 
understanding there would be no investigations or trials of former 
military officials 
that agreement allowed the civilians to take charge and 
provided them with some stability said political science 
professor david fleischer who worked in brazils senate during the 
transition period 
but it also had a negative side the military maintained great 
influence and there was no definitive rupture with the past he 
said 
one direct result was that hundreds of those directly involved 
in torture and human rights violations retained their positions in 
the police and armed forces 
president fernando collor de mello who took office in march as 
brazils first directly elected president since 1960 promised to 
abolish the national intelligence service the former 
dictatorships secret police force which was involved in 
repression of civilians 
instead he renamed the agency and put a civilian in charge but 
it continues to spy on the population 
some people hope the discovery of the mass grave leads to a 
renewed interest in fully airing abuses committed during the 
military rule 
the truth is a moral sanction wrote prominent political 
columnist clovis rossi in the folha de sao paulo newspaper the 
widows the orphans and the brothers and sisters of the victims 
have the right to know who killed their loved ones

thousands of volunteers from 
freshfaced teens to whitehaired seniors have stepped forward for 
military training as saudi arabia seeks to beef up its army 
reserves officials said sunday 
with many of the regular saudi army troops deployed to the 
nations northern border following iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait military officials are looking to boost backup forces 
the allmale saudi volunteer units function like us 
reservists some of whom were called to saudi arabia along with 
regular american troops 
the saudi volunteers train for two hours a day over four weeks 
primarily drilling and training with weapons regular saudi army 
recruits undergo six months of training 
the volunteers hold down regular jobs live at home and will be 
called up only if needed 
because of their brief training program saudi military 
officials said it is unlikely the volunteers will ever see combat 
but a captain who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
would have no qualms about putting the men into battle 
they have to be deployed when the need is there he said 
the saudi army has about 37000 troops but king fahd has 
pledged to build up the nations fighting force 
at one military training base new volunteers clad in fresh 
khakis practiced basic drill steps as sergeants yelled out commands 
most of the men had boots but some wore their sneakers they 
often made missteps 
although the saudis have age limits for volunteers from 16 to 
40 officials made exceptions for those who were particularly keen 
they stressed however the younger and older men would not go to 
battle 
i joined yesterday said 14yearold mohammed alakassa an 
eighthgrader spending his first day on the drill field 
ive never had a uniform like this before he said 
the boy said he wanted to learn to use a gun even though that 
was not the reason he joined the volunteers 
its my duty to my country he said 
mohammed abdullah almubarak who said hes more than 70 years 
old joined for similiar reasons 
i want to protect myself and my country the whitebearded 
man said through an interpreter 
a former seaman almubarak insisted he could keep up with the 
younger men and he said he wanted to learn to shoot 
i dont want to be in the back line he said

shish kebobs used to sell like hot cakes on 
friday and saturday nights at emad ahmadies shish kabob grill in 
trendy westwood village 
but not anymore 
the city has barricaded major streets on those nights to cut 
traffic and prevent the gathering of unruly crowds cooling down 
what has long been one of the citys hottest destinations for a 
night out 
last night we had to eat all the food ourselves so it 
wouldnt go bad ahmadie said on the tuesday after labor day 
weekend i wish things would go back to how they were 
the village a neighborhood of los angeles is a compact cluster 
of movie theaters restaurants bars bookstores boutiques and 
other shops outside the main entrance to the university of 
california los angeles 
surrounded by the pricey districts of brentwood belair 
century city and just west of the posh los angeles country club and 
beverly hills the village seems far from the citys troubled areas 
so when trouble happens the city takes notice and that brings 
charges from poorer parts of the city of favoritism possibly 
racially motivated 
it happened in 1988 when a gang fight erupted and a bystander 
was killed by a stray bullet the killing triggered an outcry for 
police action 
and troubles happened again this summer a scuffle aug 3 by 
about 60 youths many of whom had come to see the opening of spike 
lees mo better blues ended in three injuries and nine 
arrests 
though the injuries were not serious and on the same weekend 
murders and other violent crimes were committed elsewhere in the 
city the westwood melee as the media called it got lots of 
attention 
councilman zev yaroslavsky called for the city to put up 
barricades on major streets barriers had been used on a limited 
scale before and expanding their use had been considered for some 
time 
the barricades went up aug 24 and are expected to remain on 
friday and saturday nights indefinitely 
when more people are on the sidewalk they start jostling one 
another yaroslavsky said peoples attitudes change they get 
more defensive they get more edgy the atmosphere all over gets 
more negative in what should be a more positive place 
for many merchants the traffic blockades spelled disaster 
restaurants reported that receipts were down as much as fivefold 
yaroslavsky said that in the long run the barriers will make 
westwood a better community but some say hes fighting a losing 
battle 
there could be other ways of controlling what theyre trying 
to control said steve fulton a manager of westwood drugs but 
maybe they shouldnt try westwood is changing instead of getting 
the belair beverly hills brentwood crowd youre getting more of 
the kids running around 
the citys response to trouble in westwood has a history of 
controversy 
the 1988 killing brought widespread attention to gang violence 
and prompted the city to put more officers on patrol in westwood 
yaroslavsky called for the city to post a 25000 reward police 
were flooded with calls and a reputed gang member was convicted of 
murder 
but all that activity raised the ire of leaders in the eastside 
and southcentral areas where gangs have been rampant for years 
they accused police the media and other politicians of white 
favoritism by giving more attention to a crime in an upscale white 
area than in a poor minority neighborhood 
yaroslavsky and other officials contended that similar 
anticrime efforts have been made in poorer areas 
mark ridleythomas head of the southern christian leadership 
conference office in los angeles said complicated forces were at 
work in the responses to the gang shooting and barricade cases 
but what it always seems is that one part of the city is more 
valuable than another as subtle or as overt as some of that may 
be he said

iraqs foreign minister sunday reportedly 
sought to break the un trade embargo over his nations occupation 
of kuwait during iraqs first official visit to iran in a decade 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz met with his iranian 
counterpart ali akbar velayati amid unconfirmed reports that rice 
and flour shipments already were passing over iraqs northeastern 
border from iran 
aziz told reporters the 2hour meeting was constructive 
the eightyear iraniraq war was halted in 1988 by a ceasefire but 
the countries have never reached a peace settlement 
velayati repeated irans condemnation of iraqs seizure of 
kuwait last month but he also criticized the presence of us and 
other foreign forces building up in the persian gulf according to 
irans official islamic republic news agency 
it was not known whether aziz would hold further talks before 
his departure monday 
in a related development irans radical parliament speaker 
mehdi karrubi warned of possible attacks by moslem terrorists if 
us troops remain in the gulf region irna said 
the news agency quoted karrubi as saying the united states 
would be driven out of the region humiliated by moslems if it 
intended to remain there 
the united states should know that it will never enjoy 
security in the persian gulf he said 
proiranian shiite moslem groups have been linked to hijackings 
bombings of us marines in lebanon and the holding of 13 western 
hostages including six americans in lebanon 
karrubi said he was concerned the united states intends to keep 
troops in the region even if the iraqis withdrew from kuwait 
azizs visit the first such contact between iran and iraq since 
before the iraniraq war has been publicized as groundwork for a 
meeting between iraqi president saddam hussein and iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani 
the two are expected to meet for a peace treaty officially 
ending the hostilities between the two nations 
the overtures could free up hundreds of thousands of iraqi 
troops stationed along the 750mile iranian border they could 
presumably be used to confront us forces in saudi arabia 
talks on a formal treaty after the 1988 ceasefire were mired in 
dispute but after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait prompted us 
and other forces to rush to the region saddam began withdrawing 
troops from iranian territory and exchanging prisoners with iran 
saddam agreed to respect a 1975 treaty splitting the waters of 
the vital shattalarab waterway a key outlet to the sea for iraq 
and a major sticking point in the peace talks 
tehran sources said aziz was expected to ask iranian officials 
to allow shipment of food and medicine to iraq 
the aid in food and medicines that iran could provide could be 
of crucial important at this stage said a diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but un sanctions imposed on iraq permit only humanitarian 
shipments of food and medicine 
there is no reason to believe that iran would agree to supply 
iraq with anything more than that because that would constitute 
sanctions busting the diplomat said 
aziz was accompanied by iraqi oil minister issam abdulrahim 
alshalabi and iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh was part 
of the welcoming committee at mehrabad airport 
the presence of the two oil ministers could signify an iranian 
solution to iraqs inability to export its oil the countrys 
primary source of income 
iran pipeline running to the kharg island terminal at the 
northern end of the persian gulf could be refitted to carry iraqi 
oil from over the nearby border sources said 
but the diplomat in tehran doubted whether iran would risk 
international condemnation by doing such a valuable service for its 
former enemy 
what could aziz possibly offer them in return for that said 
the diplomat 
iraq has been seeking governments that would be willing to help 
it get around the un sanctions its tiny coastline is effectively 
blocked by the multinational fleet in the gulf 
middle east observers say that in advance of azizs trip envoys 
from yemen jordan and the palestine liberation organization 
visited tehran to seek iranian assistance in breaking iraqs 
economic isolation 
aziz was surrounded by tight security on his visit a christian 
in an overwhelmingly moslem region aziz survived an assassination 
attempt in 1980 by shiite moslem iraqis who sided with shiite iran

the economic and military 
embargoes in place against iraq could topple saddam hussein 
perhaps in two months congressmen returning from the middle east 
said sunday 
the officials we spoke with all felt that he had been weakened 
by the long costly iraniraq war the subsequent settlement with 
iran and his miscalculation in invading kuwait said rep 
john murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations defense 
subcommittee 
murtha and nine other lawmakers visited saudi arabian king fahd 
egyptian president hosni mubarak some exiled kuwaiti officials 
and us military commanders and troops in the field during their 
fiveday trip 
the consensus among the rulers they met with was that saddam 
the iraqi ruler would remain in power for two more months murtha 
said 
in that part of the world the insinuations were there are 
other methods of removing dictators from their positions of power 
other than caving in said murtha who would not elaborate 
murtha whose subcommittee oversees military spending said he 
could not estimate how much the us deployment in the gulf will 
cost 
he also said that military equipment was working surprisingly 
well in the hot sandy saudi desert 
you cant see 25 or 30 yards in front of you murtha said of 
the dusty conditions at the front lines equipment has to be 
maintained constantly they sleep in the sand beside their 
equipment yet even with those difficulties morale is very high 
the congressman said that he and his colleagues wore military 
uniforms one day to test their comfort and found them acceptable 
he did say however that a lot of sand penetrated the boots and 
that officials have discussed sending different ones to the troops

a fire sparked by lightning more than a week 
ago has consumed 2300 acres of the okefenokee national wildlife 
refuge but calm weather kept it from spreading sunday a spokesman 
said 
the fire is just creeping along right now because winds are so 
light and variable said jim burkhart fire information officer 
for the 400000acre swamp refuge in southeast georgia 
more than 180 firefighters battled the blaze 
the fire began in the swamps west end and spread east toward 
honey island and billys island he said 
billys island is a habitat for the endangered red cockaded 
woodpecker firefighters dug breaks in an effort to protect the 
birds he said 
three fires since may have burned a total of 9500 acres in the 
refuge and the typically driest months of the year october and 
november are still ahead 
researchers say fires keep the swamp from turning into a bog 
the swamp fills with vegetation that turns into peat which the 
fire helps clear but too much uncontrolled burning could destroy 
the swamp and its inhabitants they say

eleanor holmes norton the leading candidate 
for washingtons nonvoting congressional seat has no plans to 
drop out of the race despite disclosures she and her husband filed 
no local income tax returns from 1982 to 1989 an aide said sunday 
the former carter administration official has said she did not 
realize her husband did not mail the returns 
withdrawal is absolutely out of the question norton 
spokeswoman gwen mckinney said sunday im not going to say it 
wont affect the undecided voters but we have found that the 
support we have received is phenomenal 
but an influential city councilman who had remained neutral on 
the race endorsed one of nortons opponents sunday and called on 
norton to withdraw 
the message i am receiving from my constituents is that we 
cannot elect someone who has a cloud over them said councilman 
james nathanson who endorsed betty ann kane 
norton who headed the us equal employment opportunity 
commission during the carter administration said she signed the 
district of columbia tax returns for the years in question and did 
not realize until saturday that her husband had not mailed them 
i hope that the people of the district who have been 
exceedingly generous to me during this campaign will understand 
the matter for what it is a human failing and not a deliberate 
attempt to circumvent responsibility she said blaming the lapse 
on procrastination and a dispute with the city over the amount 
of taxes owed in 1982 
her husband edward norton is a lawyer and former chairman of 
the dc board of elections and ethics 
the candidates spokeswoman said an accountant working on 
nortons taxes concluded that 4959363 in city taxes withheld by 
the city from 1982 until 1989 will satisfy nortons actual tax 
obligation 
the problem now is with interest and penalties mckinney 
said she declined to say how much more norton owes

a show at once ordinary and extraordinary opened 
sunday on ellis island where the treasures from home exhibit 
elevated the most mundane of immigrants possessions to museum 
pieces 
the exhibit comprises scores of objects on loan from the 
families of immigrants who passed through ellis between 1892 and 
1954 they reflect the desire to make the ellis island immigration 
museum what chief curator diana pardue calls everymans museum 
the first days visitors many of whom had donated objects to 
the collection cried and cheered as they spotted their family 
heirlooms newly enshrined behind glass 
items ranged from the relatively exotic such as a formal 
aragonese dress fan from endofthecentury spain to passports and 
other travel documents 
the tone of the exhibit is set by a postersized excerpt from a 
letter written by sam auspitz a jew who emigrated from eastern 
europe in 1920 my mother brought her candles the ones you use 
on friday night she brought the things that were near and dear to 
us which were not very important to anybody but us 
among the donors was herman gold 82 of chester pa who 
arrived from the ukraine in 1924 he stared at his fathers old 
passport and recalled spending three long weeks on the island when 
he was 16 
doctors had detained the whole family after they discovered a 
suspicious looking fungus on his fathers fingernail 
i remember it was cold as hell at night he said they 
gave us a blanket but at night someone would always come and sneak 
and pull it out from under you thats what i remember best 
freezing to death 
a pair of elderly sisters anne and mary lipozac stood talking 
excitedly next to a display case filled with objects their mother 
brought from croatia in her hope chest 
its contents included china christening bonnets linens 
handcrocheted socks and a tiny loop of beads that was thought to 
cure sore throats 
the sisters said they regretted that their sister amy who 
helped assemble the collection died before she could see it 
encased on ellis island 
i look at this and i can only hope and pray that amy and mama 
and papa know how valuable this has become said mary lipozac 
her eyes brimming mama would be overwhelmed

pope john paul ii arrived 
sunday to consecrate the biggest christian church in the world a 
basilica that rivals the grandeur of st peters oppponents say 
the country cant afford it 
heavy security was in place around yamoussoukro the native town 
of president felix houphouetboigny to prevent antigovernment 
demonstrations by recently legalized opposition parties 
architect pierre fakhoury defended construction of the church in 
a country where roman catholics are estimated to make up less than 
15 percent of the 10 million people most of the people are 
animists and moslems 
the president swore he would give god the biggest and most 
beautiful church he could he told reporters 
on thursday police fired tear gas and used truncheons to break 
up an attempt by opposition leaders to stage a peaceful march in 
abidjan 150 miles south of here a british broadcasting corp 
television team that tried to meet with opposition leaders was 
briefly detained sunday 
houphouetboigny has ruled this nation as a oneparty state 
since independence from france in 1960 
the pope met with the president at his residence sunday evening 
among the dignitaries who were to attend the monday morning 
consecration were south african foreign minister pik botha french 
cooperation minister jacques pelletier and jeanchristophe 
mitterrand the son and counselor of president francois mitterrand 
cardinals and bishops from 18 african nations and about 350000 
people also were to attend the consecration of the basilica of our 
lady of peace which towers over this small town 150 miles north of 
abidjan 
the ivorian league of human rights charged sunday that 
authorities had forced thousands of villagers to come to 
yamoussoukro for the service 
the consecration ceremony will end a 10day papal tour of four 
african nations during which the pope has called for a narrowing 
of the economic gap between the continents urban elite and rural 
poor 
earlier sunday in kigali the capital of rwanda the 
polishborn pope prayed to the virgin mary queen of peace 
appealing for her intercession to bring peace to the world 
particularly in the persian gulf 
a rwandan government official publicly challenged the pontiff on 
the churchs attitude to aids celibacy and sainthood of africans 
christophe mfizi rwandas state information director said 
doctors were hard pressed to defend catholic bans on birth control 
in nations facing a population problem and the use of condoms to 
prevent the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
john paul initially declined to visit the basilica in 
yamoussoukro but accepted the invitation after houphouetboigny 
agreed to build a hospital nearby and grant the catholic church 
permission to open a radio station 
houphouetboigny a catholic has said he paid for the 
construction of the basilica with his own money 
but opposition leader laurent gbagbo has questioned how the 
president a former cocoa farmer could afford to pay for a 
basilica on the scale of st peters in vatican city government 
opponents have accused houphouetboigny of stealing state funds 
the government says the basilica cost 140 million but other 
estimates have put its cost as high as 250 million 
gbagbo a catholic has promised not to organize demonstrations 
we will not disturb this visit but the pope should know that the 
visit disturbs our faith he said 
bishops have told other priests that they are not obliged to 
attend the consecration according to church sources 
the basilica was built between 1985 and 1989 years of hardship 
for ivorians as the countrys economy nearly collapsed because of 
slumping world prices for cocoa the main export 
fakhoury an ivorian of lebanese descent said the church is 
bigger than st peters on which it is modeled st peters had 
been considered the largest church in the christian world 
the basilica looms up from a 320acre site carved out of a 
former cocoa plantation owned by houphouetboigny at its tip it is 
525 feet high compared with 452 feet at the top of the cross on 
the dome of st peters 
sixty artisans painters and cutters from 14 countries worked on 
the 15000 panels of stained glass more than exist in all of 
france 
the basilica seats 7000 people and another 11000 standing the 
entire grounds can accommodate more than 350000 worshipers

a fort worth jail has promised to 
reconsider its system of marking homosexual inmates with colored 
wristbands a policy one gay activist said was like throwing meat 
to the dogs 
all prisoners at tarrant county jail wear colored wristbands 
red for felons blue for misdemeanor offenders orange for those 
awaiting transfer to federal prisons yellow for prisoners with 
medical problems and gray for homosexuals 
new inmates are questioned as they enter the jail which houses 
both men and women those who say they are homosexual or bisexual 
are allowed protective custody because homosexuals are common 
targets of abuse by other inmates jail officials said saturday 
homosexual inmates who choose protective custody are given gray 
wristbands and housed in isolated groups although they mingle with 
the rest of the prisoners during meals and exercise breaks 
officials said 
we need to make sure one prisoner is not abusing another 
prisoner for any reason and this is an aid to us said john 
pempsell the chief deputy sheriff who oversees the jail 
many homosexual activists and civil libertarians said the 
wristbands invite abuse rather than deter it 
youre putting a sign around their neck like come and beat 
on me said ed koren a washington attorney for the national 
prison project of the american civil liberties union 
tarrant county gay alliance member thomas bruner said the policy 
is like throwing meat to the dogs 
jail administrator bill broome met thursday with two members of 
the gay alliance and said the policy which has been in effect for 
years would be reconsidered 
no policy is set in concrete broome said but the 
question has never before been brought to my attention 
broome did not say when the policy might be changed

he said 
the passengers told harrowing tales of escape from kuwait they 
said they went into seclusion after iraqs invasion aug 2 because 
westerners were at risk if they moved freely they also spoke of 
the brave but outmanned resistance fighters trying to battle iraqi 
invasion forces 
i was lucky enough and smart enough to get away said jimmy

westerners are not safe there she said we dont know 
what they iraqis are going to do next 
social workers customs agents and other officials greeted the 
evacuees many of whom were to spend the night in charleston 
because they could not get connecting flights to other destinations 
this is the same crowd that was gathered to handle the 
aftermath of hurricane hugo which struck charleston and much of 
the south carolina coast in september 1989 gov carroll campbell 
said this is a much more pleasant assignment 
as the evacuees left the concourse and entered the main 
terminal they could choose from an array of social service 
agencies 
the passengers were greeted with applause by those waiting at 
the airport children carried teddy bears gifts from volunteer 
workers who met the plane 
maria alrizaiqi an american whose husband musallam is a 
citizen of the united arab emirates had gone to kuwait on the 
night before the iraqi invasion to visit friends they were unable 
to leave until the flights this weekend 
i was very scared she said they were taking foreigners 
they said any person harboring foreigners in their house the whole 
family would be executed 
musallam alrizaiqi said one of his friends was killed last week 
they took him last sunday then i saw him the next monday he 
was shot dead in the street then they buried him his friends 
he said 
the couple planned to head to miami where mrs alrizaiqi has 
relatives 
hawkins described how he escaped from kuwait in a car owned by a 
jordanian friend they went to baghdad but were arrested 
hawkins said he bribed police in iraqs capital disguised 
himself as an iranian and fled for the jordanian border before he 
was turned back later he said he crossed the desert at night and 
made his way to amman 
in the days after the invasion hawkins said there was 
resistance theres fighting nightly there were bullets flying and 
bombs going off every day the resistance is very brave and 
well organized but theyre low on equipment and badly outnumbered 
added alrizaiqi the resistance is very strong one of my 
friends said no matter what they will never get us 
hawkins said there is food bread eggs and potatoes in kuwait 
most everything you can buy in iraq has been stolen from 
kuwait he said 
state and local politicians turned out to welcome the evacuees 
home 
campbell wore a yellow ribbon on the lapel of his blue suit 
and us rep arthur ravenel whose congressional district includes 
charleston were on hand as was us sen ernest hollings dsc 
im just here to welcome them home you can imagine how they 
feel ravenel said 
us officials estimate about 2200 americans remain in iraq and 
kuwait some of the men in that group have been sent to military 
installations to discourage possible western attacks 
earlier this year americans evacuated from the civil war in 
liberia were brought back to the united states through charleston 
last year american military dependents were evacuated from panama 
to charleston prior to the us invasion 
when the united states invaded the island of grenada in 1983 a 
total of 698 evacuees many of them us medical students were 
returned to the united states through charleston

home in the killing of five college students found a knife hidden 
in a milk carton a newspaper reported sunday

identified by police as one of eight suspects they have refused to 
call him the prime suspect 
the sun reported that the knife was found where humphrey told 
investigators earlier this month it would be lab tests will be

president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev joined sunday in an extraordinary condemnation 
of iraqs invasion of kuwait and said they agreed in seven hours 
of summit talks that aggression cannot and will not pay 
gorbachev emphasized the need for a political solution 
insisting that his former ally saddam hussein is headed into a 
dead end by struggling to hold kuwait against stiff international 
sanctions 
bush held out the possibility of using force if the embargo is 
not effective but gorbachev pointedly refrained from saying the 
soviet union would support a military move against iraq 
yet the soviet president said he hoped to make it quite clear 
to saddam hussein that if iraq were to provoke military action 
then the result would be a tragedy first and foremost for the iraqi 
people themselves for the whole of the region and for the whole of 
the world 
the leaders spoke with reporters following the release of their 
joint summit declaration that said we are united in the belief 
that iraqs aggression must not be tolerated no peaceful 
international order is possible if larger states can devour their 
smaller neighbors 
our preference is to resolve the persian gulf crisis 
peacefully and we will be united against iraqs aggression as long 
as the crisis exists they declared 
the statement stood in unprecedented contrast to cold war 
bickering that accompanied crises during the past four decades 
the statement also said that once iraq withdraws from kuwait 
the two countries will work with nations in the region to develop 
regional security structures and measures to promote peace and 
stability 
afterward as he headed home aboard air force one bush said he 
couldnt be more pleased by his talks with gorbachev and the 
clear signal they sent to saddam hussein 
asked how the summit had changed things bush told reporters 
i think he saddam has been hopeful that he could divide and 
peel the soviet union away from the united states and from the rest 
of the world 
bush who returned to washington late sunday night said he 
hoped to meet again with gorbachev late this year or early next 
year 
the official iraqi news agency ina said in a commentary that the 
summit showed bushs evil tendencies and his spite for the arab 
nation and its central issues primarily the tragedy of the 
palestinian people who are suffering under the zionist occupation 
enforced by us support 
at the summitconcluding news conference with gorbachev bush 
said soviet support for antiiraq sanctions gets me inclined to 
recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible 
he said there had been a good long discussion on soviet 
requests for economic assistance and that he would address the 
topic when he makes a nationally televised speech to congress 
tuesday night 
the possibility that sanctions will not succeed against iraq 
prompted the most significant differences between bush and 
gorbachev 
without elaboration their joint statement said if the 
current steps fail to end it we are prepared to consider 
additional ones consistent with the united nations charter 
i did not say that if iraq does not withdraw peacefully were 
going to have recourse to military methods i do not state 
that said the soviet president 
we may have a difference on that bush acknowledged he said 
again that he will not discuss us options if iraq continues to 
defy the un resolution 
one other area of disagreement emerged the presence of nearly 
200 soviet military advisers in iraq once a major military client 
of the soviet union 
gorbachev said the number of advisers had been reduced from 196 
to about 150 they are leaving iraq and the process is moving 
forward so i dont think its a problem he said 
said bush i think it would facilitate things if all the 
advisers were withdrawn he said but added it was not a major 
irritant 
there was no attempt to claim agreement on all elements of gulf 
policy 
said gorbachev differences nuances in the differences of 
view arguments these can be these are natural its natural 
those should arise but what we have seen today is that we have 
confirmed the most important progress of recent time 
said bush neither of us try to indicate that we look at 
exactly every problem exactly the same way 
while the persian gulf crisis was the dominant topic the two 
presidents said they had agreed to press their arms control 
negotiators to seek terms on limiting both strategic arms and 
conventional weapons in europe 
we really have agreed to make fresh efforts gorbachev said 
because there is a possibility negotiations could be concluded by 
years end 
one us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
two leaders had not settled any of the issues blocking agreement on 
either accord a fresh push for agreement could come as early as 
this week when secretary of state james baker meets in moscow with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze

gasoline prices across the nation continued 
to climb last week but at a slower rate than immediately after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait an oil industry analyst said sunday 
the average price for all grades of gasoline at full and 
selfserve stations was 135 a gallon friday an increase of 228 
cents a gallon from aug 24 according to trilby lundbergs survey 
of 13600 gasoline stations 
the middle east crisis is still driving these moves because of 
the impact of the highly sensitive international market said 
lundberg publisher of the biweekly lundberg letter 
prices jumped an average of 102 cents a gallon between july 20 
and aug 10 and another 52 cents a gallon between aug 10 and aug 
24 lundberg said 
so you can see the rate has slowed down but a 228 increase 
is still very strong for this time of year she said 
the average price of regular leaded gasoline at selfserve 
stations last week was 123 a gallon while regular unleaded sold 
for 124 a gallon and premium unleaded was just shy of 141 a 
gallon lundbergs survey showed 
at fullservice stations regular leaded retailed for 146 a 
gallon regular unleaded averaged nearly 147 a gallon and premium 
unleaded sold for 160 a gallon 
whether gasoline prices soften as they often do in colder 
months after peak summer driving depends on the unknown of crude 
oil supplies and the mideast crisis said lundberg

tehran irans capital in the first official iraqi visit since the 
two countries went to war in 1980 the fighting ended in a 
ceasefire in august 1988 
sources in tehran speaking on condition of anonymity said aziz 
was likely to ask iranian officials to allow shipments of food and 
medicine into his country the un embargo permits only 
humanitarian shipments of such supplies

president saddam hussein and iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
to sign a peace treaty officially ending hostilities 
in sundays talks iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
reiterated his countrys condemnation of the invasion of kuwait

faction of the palestine liberation organization abul abbas head 
of the palestine liberation front told the american television 
network cnn that his group could strike if the united states 
initiates the attack on the arab people and on us 
in another indication iraq was hurting from unimposed 
sanctions the baghdad government is cracking down on black 
marketeers 
iraqi newspapers on sunday published a government decree saying 
anyone hoarding food or gouging prices on scarce food will face 
jail terms of up to 15 years food already is being rationed 
the syrian news agency in its dispatch on explosions in iraq 
said its correspondent in the town of boukamal three miles west of

appeals for urgent blood donations to save the lives of the 
victims were made minutes later over loudspeakers in alqaims 
mosques 
the news agency said no further details were available syria is 
a bitter rival of iraq within the arab world and has sent troops to 
saudi arabia as part of a multinational arab force 
the governmentrun iraqi news agency quoting an unidentified 
source dismissed the syrian report of explosions as sheer 
fabrication 
in helsinki finland president bush and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev agreed anew sunday on the path that the un 
has set in forcing iraq to pull its troops out of kuwait 
but the superpower leaders stopped short of asking each other to 
take any immediate specific measures to force iraq from kuwait 
saudi arabia an orthodox moslem kingdom has resisted relations 
with moscow over the years because of its aversion to atheistic 
communism but prince saud alfaisal the saudi foreign minister 
said sunday there have been serious contacts with moscow about 
establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries 
iraqs 1 millionmember army has deployed an estimated 260000 
troops along with hundreds of tanks in and around kuwait since 
seizing its oilrich southern neighbor in a dispute over oil land

liberian president samuel k doe sometimes boasted that he had 
survived more than 30 coup attempts but on sunday his many lives 
may have run out 
a rebel faction led by prince johnson shot doe in both legs and 
captured him sunday in a battle outside the headquarters of the 
west african task force sent to monrovia to end the countrys 
8monthold civil war 
doe had ventured out of his fortified seaside mansion to make an 
unscheduled visit to lt gen arnold quainoo of ghana the task 
forces commander 
johnson declared himself president and pledged to courtmartial 
doe charles taylor the leader of the rival rebel national 
patriotic front which controls most of the country outside 
monrovia has also named himself president 
doe had been holed up in his mansion since july as street 
fighting raged in the capital his troops many of them members of 
his krahn tribe reportedly refused to let him flee without 
obtaining assurances for their own safety 
as the rebels advanced the liberian leader sent out conflicting 
signals about whether he would resign he rejected an offer by the 
us ambassador to help him leave the country 
liberias civil war began dec 24 when taylor led a small rebel 
force in an invasion from ivory coast in march johnson broke away 
to form his own faction 
despite the split the rebels continued to gain recruits and 
take control of nearly all the country except for part of monrovia 
the rebels have accused doe of nepotism and stealing millions of 
dollars of state money they also hold him responsible for the 
deaths of thousands of civilians killed during the civil war 
as a master sergeant doe seized power in a bloody coup on april 
12 1980 that ousted descendants of american slaves who founded 
liberia in 1847 the coup ended the rule of president william 
tolbert who was killed 
doe came to power by playing on the resentment felt by the 
majority of the population members of indigenous african tribes 
toward the americoliberians who had dominated the country for more 
than 100 years 
doe was born on may 6 1950 in tuzon grand gedeh county

ministry of national defense radio and communication school in 
monrovia

numerous coup attempts murders and detentions of opposition 
leaders and suppression of the countrys press 
he permitted elections in october 1985 when opposition parties 
appeared to have won the voting does men burned and destroyed 
ballots the election commission doe had appointed declared him the 
winner

rule prior to the civil war at least 1500 people were estimated 
to have died including brig gen thomas quiwonkpa who led a coup 
attempt 
quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from nimba county and his 
killing made his home area a fertile base for taylors rebels when 
they invaded liberia
