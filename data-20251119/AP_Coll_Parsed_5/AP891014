a federal regulatory panel rejected a 
request by massachusetts attorney general to reopen an inquiry 
into training at the seabrook nuclear project because of problems 
during lowpower testing 
the atomic safety and licensing board on thursday ruled that 
massachusetts officials had not proven that the june 22 shutdown at 
the plant presented a significant safety issue 
the decision reaffirms what weve said since the incident 
ron sher spokesman for plant operator new hampshire yankee said 
friday 
sher said it was an isolated situation with no safety 
significance and we took immediate decisive action to address the 
causes of the incident and will continue to ensure safety and 
excellence in all plant operations 
seabrook is completed but lacks federal permission to operate 
commercially plant officials expect to get a license by the end of 
the year 
the utility delayed shutting down the plant after a valve 
malfunctioned despite the urgings of nuclear regulatory commission 
inspectors in the control room federal and state officials later 
criticized control room personnel for the delay 
new hampshire yankee promised that the problem would be 
corrected 
massachusetts officials argued that the event demonstrated that 
plant operators and management lack adequate managerial and 
administrative controls to operate the facility at any level of 
power they argued that a new hearing on a fullpower license was 
needed because of the relationship between lowpower and fullpower 
operation 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon has been an 
outspoken foe of the plant 
the federal panel said no evidence was presented to raise 
legitimate doubts about seabrook and safety procedures 
the panel also concluded that the june 22 incident didnt pose a 
safety threat and was an aberration the delay in shutting down the 
reactor resulted from a narrow omission in training and a 
misunderstanding the panel wrote in its decision

a tropical storm in the gulf of mexico showed signs 
of growing into a hurricane friday threatening to swamp coastal 
areas already facing abnormally high tides and prompting the 
evacuation of offshore oil rigs 
tropical storm jerry which developed rapidly from a tropical 
depression off the mexican coast on friday had maximum sustained 
winds of 70 mph and appeared to be gaining intensity according to 
the national hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
the center issued a hurricane watch from port arthur texas to 
the mouth of the mississippi river a hurricane warning for 
portions of the watch area was likely to be issued saturday 
at 1030 pm edt friday the center of jerry was located at 
245 north latitude and 936 west longitude or about 425 miles 
southsouthwest of new orleans and moving north at 13 mph 
oil companies began evacuating offshore rigs and platforms early 
in the day officials said in new orleans more than 4000 workers 
in the gulf were to be be brought ashore by helicopter and ship 
we started as soon as it became a tropical storm said wendy 
jacobs of shell oil everyone knows you dont take any chances 
with these 
the hurricane center advised gulf coast residents and marine 
operations to closely monitor advisories on the storm 
at the moment louisiana appears to be in the greatest danger 
but the storm could turn over the weekend said forecaster 
gilbert clark a coastal flood watch was issued for the texas coast 
rough seas from jerry also may coincide with an unusual 
astronomical phenomenon that is expected to elevate average tides 
to a 10year high said clark 
the moon which raises tides with its gravitational pull will 
be both full and at its closest point to the earth next week in 
addition the moons orbit is over the northern hemisphere which 
adds to its affect on the seas 
clark said tides could be up to a foot higher in the gulf and 
more in the open ocean 
a situation likes this happens about once every decade he 
said but it also has the reverse affect low tides will be at 
their lowest 
jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since hurricane 
hugo ravaged the caribbean and coastal south carolina last month 
tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximum 
sustained winds reach 39 mph hurricanes are declared when winds 
hit 74 mph the atlantic hurricane season runs from june to 
november

college researchers are popping a mountain 
of corn to glean a kernel of information how come there are 
always a few unpopped duds at the bottom of your bowl 
in what must be one of the bestsmelling laboratories anywhere 
university of illinois researchers periodically pop 5 to 6 pounds 
of research popcorn an hour for several hours then analyze the 
kernels that are too pooped to pop 
the brand used is that created by orville redenbacher the 
entrepreneur who gave this snackforthemasses panache when he 
touted his popcorn as gourmet quality redenbachers parent 
company beatricehuntwesson foods inc of fullerton calif 
gave the school 45000 to conduct the research 
the volume of this industry is so larg that even small 
improvements make a significant impact on profits researcher 
bruce litchfield of the college of agriculture said earlier this 
week 
americans consume about 13 billion quarts of popped corn 
annually and the industry has been swelling at a rate of about 5 
percent a year 
there are two key quality factors in popcorn total pop volume 
and the number of kernels that do not pop 
we are interested in finding out more about how we can breed 
the corn for better popability how we can harvest it to avoid 
damage to the kernels and how we can store it to maintain the 
right percentage of moisture said kay carpenter spokeswoman for 
beatricehunt wesson itself a subsidiary of chicagobased bci 
holdings corp 
redenbachers popcorn packaged for both stovetop and microwave 
preparation is the market leader research produced the 
highquality brand and research will lead to further improvements 
said ms carpenter 
he bred his corn to pop fluffier and to have a more tender 
less chewy texture but unpopped kernels were his real pet 
peeve she said 
when the popcorn arrives from the redenbacher facility in 
valparaiso ind it is stripped from the cob mechanically 
researchers pop it in a movie theater popper measure the volume 
and dump it onto a screen where unpopped kernels fall through for 
counting 
more than 800 pounds have been popped in the name of science 
since the project began in march some of the data is eaten on the 
spot but much of it is given to a local elementary school said ui 
food engineer steve eckhoff 
kernels pop when heat turns internal moisture into steam 
creating pressure that bursts the outer shell the pressure cannot 
build in kernels with cracked coatings so they either dont pop or 
pop only partially 
factors that influence a kernels popability is damage to the 
shell when it is stripped from the cob and too much or too little 
moisture eckhoff said 
researchers have identified two techniques to loosen kernels 
from the ears before stripping one is preconditioning cobs by 
changing temperature and humidity the other is using an enzyme to 
help break the bond between kernel and cob 
corn that has been mechanically shelled has twice as many 
unpopped kernels as handshelled corn and less total pop volume 
he said 
still there are usually no more than 30 duds called upks in 
the trade for unpopped kernels in a jar of 4000 kernels of 
highquality popcorn 
that may sound too paltry to study but as eckhoff said a upk 
doesnt mean much until you bite down on it

a network television news crew arrived in boston 
this week to do a special report on urban fires and quickly found 
firefighters battling a chinatown blaze that was one of the citys 
worst in several years 
weve done stories with police around the country where they 
say gee you should have been here last week said eric 
engberg a correspondent for the cbs program 48 hours 
this is a case when last week was this week he said 
the firefighting report scheduled to air later this month will 
look into fire issues around the country including arson and 
forest fires producers picked boston for a segment on urban fires 
engberg said the first fire for the news crew came wednesday 
night but then on thursday they followed firefighters to a blaze 
in the citys chinatown section 
the fire caused an estimated 2 million in damage and became a 
downtown spectacle as flames filled a sixstory building and 
ignited nearly 2000 pounds of illegal fireworks setting off 
thunderous explosions 
this fire is going to be the star of the show engberg said 
fire officials said a cutting torch used to dismantle a 
sprinkler system illegally appeared to have caused the fire they 
said they were trying to determine who cut off the sprinkler system 
and who stored the fireworks 
more than a dozen people suffered minor injuries as a result of 
the fire but no one was seriously hurt officials said

stocks tumbled and the dow jones industrial 
average plummeted nearly 191 points friday in the deepest plunge 
since the crash of 1987 battered by fears that the takeover fever 
driving up prices may be over 
its total emotional and psychological chaos said analyst 
eugene peroni of janney montgomery scott in philadelphia people 
are dumping everything a great deal of money is being lost 
brokers said the drop was triggered primarily by news that a 
labormanagement group failed to secure financing for the proposed 
675 billion takeover of united airlines parent ual corp 
acquisition of the company would have relied largely on the sale 
of highrisk junk bonds commonly used to finance takeovers 
known as leveraged buyouts 
the ual announcement means the problems in the junk bond 
market are spreading said hugh johnson senior vice president at 
first albany corp 
it means that its going to be difficult even impossible 
to finance acquisitions and leveraged buyouts he said 
leveraged buyouts have been the principal drive to stock prices 
this year and if that prop gets removed stocks would have to 
go down 
brokers said computerized selling strategies that can dump 
stocks on the market accelerated the plunge the same scenario that 
preceded the 1987 crash 
at the closing bell the widely watched dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks had plunged by 19058 points to 256926 by far 
the biggest drop since the 508point crash on oct 19 1987 other 
stock indices also fell sharply 
the figure represented a drop of 691 percent in the dow but 
still was the 12th largest percentage decline on record until 
friday the worst dow drop this year occurred march 17 when the 
index lost about 48 points 
the speed of the decline on friday the 13th spooked traders who 
were reminded of the epic stock panic nearly two years ago to the 
day more than 250 million shares changed hands and nearly 200 
billion in stock values were wiped out 
nobody believes in witchcraft but were seeing the same type 
of phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago said 
washington economist michael evans 
dazed financial workers poured out of their offices into the 
canyons of wall street assessing the damage and making comparisons 
to 1987 
the plunge triggered panicky trading in the currency markets and 
sent the dollars value sharply lower 
bond prices rose dramatically as investors sought a safe haven 
in the credit markets interest rates which drop when bond prices 
rise dropped to their lowest levels since april 1987 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said in a statement that 
the decline should be viewed in the context of a 591point rise 
since jan 1 1989 he said the drop doesnt signal any 
fundamental change in the condition of the economy the economy 
remains well balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate 
growth 
us securities and exchange commission chairman richard c 
breeden who took office earlier this week had no comment the 
federal reserve also had no comment 
president bush leaving the white house for the weekend at camp 
david ignored shouted questions from reporters about the plunge 
new york stock exchange president richard a grasso said 
safeguards put in place after the 1987 debacle helped soften the 
blow from fridays drop 
all of the safeguards and the coordination procedures that we 
developed in the last two years were utilized today and worked 
exceptionally well grasso said 
problems in the risky junkbond market were exacerbated last 
month when canadian retailing giant campeau corp announced it was 
unable to make payments on some of the bonds it issued in its 
buyouts of allied stores corp and federated department stores inc 
skittishness has sharply curbed investors appetite for junk 
bonds so named because of their low credit ratings just as a 
large number were to be sold by the end of the year prices of junk 
bonds dropped for the 17th straight day friday 
the ual news seemed to trigger a selling panic said analyst 
hildegarde zagorski of prudentialbache securities inc ual the 
secondbiggest airline in the country is part of the dow 
transportation index 
the casualties included companies currently involved in takeover 
fights and firms that have already won their battles among the 
hardest hit was time warner inc which is in the process of 
completing its 14 billion acquisition of warner communications 
inc time warner skidded 1125 a share to 13175 american 
airlines parent amr corp which faces a 7 billion takeover bid 
from developer donald trump amr slipped 12 cents from thursdays 
close to finish at 9862 a share 
other observers said news from the labor department that 
wholesale prices rose sharply in september suggested inflation was 
heating up again reducing the likelihood the federal reserve would 
act to ease interest rates 
the dows decline reverberated in canada where stock prices 
suffered their worst decline in two years the key 300share 
composite index at the toronto stock exchange the only foreign 
market open during wall streets plunge lost 14169 points to 
close at 387074 to conclude what had been a quiet session 
the fallout is expected to continue beginning late sunday us 
time when foreign markets reopen beginning with new zealand and 
australia and followed by japan hong kong and european markets 
in new york the market had been gradually retreating throughout 
fridays session with the dow off about 23 points at 2 pm edt 
but a tailspin pushed the key index down an additional 100 points 
in little more than an hour amid news the ual deal had run aground 
the drop was eerily reminiscent of a 108point dow drop on a 
friday exactly two years ago which proved to be a harbinger of the 
centurys second stock market disaster on the following monday 
oct 19 
zagorski said she did not expect the events of 1987 to be 
repeated its not going to go down too much further from these 
levels she said shortly before the market closed 
peroni however said such a severe drop on a friday is cause 
for particular concern its bad because it means that theres 
going to be two days for fear to fester before investors have a 
chance to trade again monday 
following the 1987 crash regulators imposed what they called 
circuit breakers on the dow that would automatically limit 
trading if the index rose or fell 50 points the restriction was 
later expanded to 250 points as part of a coordinated program with 
other stock and futures markets 
but confusion over the rule was rampant friday nobody seems 
to be clear on where the circuit breaker is peroni said if 
there is one it certainly is failing 
in chicago similar circuit breakers went into effect for the 
first time friday when trading in standard amp poors 500 futures on 
the mercantile exchange was halted after the december contract fell 
the limit of 12 points 
trading resumed after the required 30minute halt but the 
contract fell the limit again and trading ceased once more before 
the market was to close

the programs are described in a report made public friday by an 
organization that says they show community colleges in big cities 
are doing more than just teaching classes the report was released 
by the commission on urban community colleges of the american 
association of community and junior colleges 
they are dealing with what i believe to be the very difficult 
issues of our times and in many ways go beyond their original 
mission and in some sense go beyond what many of us would consider 
routine or traditional higher education said maurice d 
weidenthal director of the commissions urban college project and 
author of the report 
this is not the old campus school for the elite this is for 
youngsters who are at risk said roscoe brown jr president of 
bronx community college of the city university of new york 
wiedenthal a former education editor of the cleveland press 
visited 10 urban community college campuses 
the study found these campuses to be feisty solid centers of 
learning with educational images relatively unscathed by the 
disappointing performance of nearby school systems or the decay of 
surrounding neighborhoods he wrote in this weeks issue of the 
community technical and junior college times 
the average age of community college students is 30 said dale 
parnell president of the association who said the schools are 
getting many people attending the twoyear colleges to train for 
new jobs 
alfred a dellibovi undersecretary of housing and urban 
development attended the commissions press conference and said

be created he said they require new skills its the 
community colleges that are right there on the cutting edge 
providing those skills

news conference parnell said they have not taken any interest 
in urban education

visit east harlem on monday and tuesday to attend a conference on 
choice in education

the national endowment for democracy wont 
give money to a costa rican political organization because of 
questions about the congressionallyfunded organizations role in 
partisan politics 
keith schuette president of the national republican institute 
for international affairs the neds republican wing said friday 
the funding for the group ended in july but he defended the 
support for the group which has strong ties to costa ricas main 
opposition party 
we view and the endowment views this as within the mandate of 
what weve been approved to do he said 
president bush will visit costa rica later this month for 
celebrations marking 100 years of democracy there 
papers prepared by justin castillo nephew of carlos manuel 
castillo a member of arias national liberation party who is 
running for president say the endowment over the past three years 
helped finance opposition party attacks against costa ricas 
president oscar arias and his nobel prizewinning peace plan 
according to the papers obtained by the associated press the 
endowment backed a front organization for the opposition social 
christian party 
theres a fine line here about what is legal and if it wasnt 
illegal then it certainly was inappropriate castillo said 
arias repeatedly refused calls from the reagan administration to 
take a more active role in denouncing the leftist sandinista 
government in nicaragua his peace plan also was cited by democrats 
in congress as the reason for voting down administrationsupported 
aid for the contra rebels fighting the nicaraguan government 
the papers said and schuette confirmed that the association for 
the defense of costa rican liberty and democracy received 450000 
over three years from the endowment 
it is ironic the papers assert that the head of the group 
rafael angel calderon was the recipient in his previous 
presidential campaign of 500000 from panamas dictator gen 
manuel noriega the papers cited congressional testimony by jose 
blandon a former noriega aide for that contention 
calderon is a presidential contender for the february elections 
the national endowment for democracy a nonprofit organization 
that receives congressional money was created in 1983 to 
strengthen democratic institutions around the world through 
nongovernmental efforts and normally does not finance political 
parties or candidates 
we are not allowed to become involved or support a candidate 
or campaign schuette said exceptions were made in grenada 
following the 1983 incursion and in nicaragua with support for 
the conservative party in 1984 
the bush administration has been seeking endowment funds for 
nicaraguas political opposition coalition for februarys election 
schuette in a june 5 letter to carl gershman endowment 
president said the costa rican program would be changed to avoid 
the appearance of impropriety 
while these charges are absolutely untrue he wrote the 
reemergence of such questions at this time is obviously cause for 
concern

a house panel investigating abuses at the 
department of housing and urban development has received its 
strongest allegation yet that former hud secretary samuel pierce 
took a direct role on behalf of politically connected developers 
former general services administrator gerald carmen testified 
friday that he met only with pierce once a former colleague of 
his in seeking tax credits and rental subsidies to develop an 
apartment rehabilitation project in arlington texas 
about six weeks after the meeting in pierces office pierces 
executive assistant deborah gore dean and thenfederal housing 
commissioner thomas demery approved carmens 316unit pebble creek 
project for funding 
but the approval in a march 4 1987 memo occurred more than a 
month before the local arlington public housing authority even 
filed an application to hud according to agency documents 
rep tom lantos dcalif said friday the paper trail and 
carmens testimony contradict pierces statement to the 
subcommittee last spring that he took no part in project decisions 
i dont want to concede that although i do concede thats the 
way it looks carmen told lantos house government operations 
employment and housing subcommittee 
however carmen added im a little surprised at the way it 
went and i find myself a little uncomfortable at the position im 
in now 
carmens testimony occurred in the 20th subcommittee hearing 
that lantos had held over six months into influence peddling 
mismanagement and alleged fraud at hud during the eight years 
pierce was a member of president reagans cabinet 
in his last appearance before the subcommittee in september 
pierce cited his fifth amendment rights on selfincrimination and 
refused to answer any questions the panel has subpoenaed pierce to 
testify again later this month and in november 
in his testimony carmen acknowledged the texas project has 
already returned 800000 in profits to him through upfront tax 
credits although he put up no money of his own 
at the time carmen said he saw the 316unit pebble creek 
moderate rehabilitation program project as an opportunity to both 
make money and do some good by providing rentsubsidized 
housing to poor people in arlington 
formerly a manchester nh businessman carmen worked with 
pierce during the transition between the carter and reagan 
administrations after the 1980 election carmen was a member of 
reagans transition team for hud and pierce was named to be the 
departments secretary 
carmen was appointed to head the general services 
administration which is responsible for building or leasing most 
government offices and acting as a supply officer for much of the 
federal bureaucracy he held the gsa post until 1984 when reagan 
named him us ambassador to united nations agencies in geneva 
switzerland 
as in other cases where projects were pushed by washington 
insiders local arlington officials were unaware of the potential 
for the apartment project before he approached them carmen said 
pebble creek was developed as a limited partnership between 
carmen and joshua muss a law partner of carmens daughter 
carmen and muss used hud guaranteed mortgages to borrow 82 
million 4 million for buying a rundown apartment complex and 4 
million to upgrade it and sharing in 24 million in up front tax 
credits plus 18 million in annual hud rent subsidies

a convicted killer who held a female 
doctor hostage for 10 hours in a prison infirmary friday was shot 
to death by sheriffs deputies who stormed into the room 
authorities said 
kenneth james meller 48 was shot after the officers tossed a 
concussion grenade into the office and rushed in meller made 
some sort of move hes dead said terry hubert a spokesman for 
the northern nevada correctional center 
hubert added that dr karen gedney was a bit stunned by the 
grenade but otherwise unharmed 
prison officials said that during the ordeal meller talked 
about committing suicide on saturday exactly 14 years after he 
shot and killed a nevada highway patrol trooper following a bank 
robbery 
state prison director ron angelone said meller didnt threaten 
dr gedney until the end as it was going downhill he said that 
if anyone showed his face he would hurt her at that point we 
decided to go in 
larry henry gov bob millers press secretary said he was told 
that the deputies rushed into the doctors office through a door 
and a window 
the plan was to isolate the man from the woman they tried to 
catch him there were a couple of shots and he got hit henry 
said 
the decision to storm the room followed lengthy negotiations 
with meller that involved warden brenda burns angelone and the 
local sheriff paul mcgrath 
meller had gone into the mediumsecurity prisons infirmary 
about 10 am scuffled with staffers and then took gedney hostage 
saying he was thinking about killing himself 
prison officials said meller had a 4inch knife prison 
spokesman glen warton said earlier reports that meller had tied 
himself to gedney were incorrect meller had a telephone and had 
been in constant contact with officials who could see him through 
windows in the infirmary he made no demands 
meller was serving a noparole life term for killing a nevada 
highway patrol trooper at lake tahoe in 1975 he had no record of 
previous trouble in the prison system

the bush administration is reconsidering key 
parts of an 81 billion plan for revitalizing the nations nuclear 
weapons complex including a proposal for building a new plutonium 
refinery in idaho officials said 
the plan unveiled in the final days of the reagan 
administration was billed as a 20year blueprint for modernizing 
the weapons plants which are plagued by mechanical breakdowns 
safety flaws and widespread environmental problems 
since then the breadth and depth of the problems have 
increased and energy secretary james d watkins has tried to 
overhaul the weapons program to focus more on safety and 
environmental issues 
in a sept 29 internal memorandum made available to the 
associated press on friday watkins said he was creating a 
committee of defense specialists to review the recommendations of 
the december 1988 modernization plan prepared by his predecessor 
john herrington as well as its underlying assumptions 
watkins made clear he was unhappy with some elements of the 
herrington blueprint although he did not say what changes he 
wanted he made no mention of costs 
they did not adequately address some of the serious problems 
that have since been identified particularly with respect to 
environmental and waste management issues watkins wrote 
based on my review of these results i am not satisfied that 
the assumptions upon which the study was based are valid when 
reviewed by todays standards he said adding he was ordering 
a hard relook at this whole issue 
watkins did not spell out exactly what parts of the 2010 report 
he did not like he said john tuck the no 3 official in the 
department would head the review committee which also includes 
representatives of the joint chiefs of staff and the national 
security council 
one official involved in the review who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the group would present a report to watkins office 
on monday recommending a set of assumptions upon which to develop a 
new modernization blueprint 
a final report to watkins on modernization recommendations is 
due next april 2 
the official said one assumption under review is the need for a 
special isotope separation plant which would convert existing 
supplies of fuelgrade plutonium to a grade suitable for 
thermonuclear warheads critics have questioned the need for the 
plant in light of adequate existing supplies of plutonium it would 
be built at the idaho national engineering laboratory 
another proposal under review is a plan to build two new 
tritiumproducing reactors one at the idaho laboratory and the 
other at the savannah river weapons plant near aiken sc the 
official said they would replace three aging and currently 
shutdown savannah river reactors that make the tritium needed for 
nuclear warheads 
many members of congress have said budget constraints are likely 
to kill at least one of the planned reactors 
among other elements of the 2010 report now under review the 
official said are 
ending all operations at the rocky flats plant near denver and 
transferring its plutoniumprocessing activities to other 
facilities the main reason is its proximity to a major urban 
center the fbi currently is investigating alleged environmental 
violations at the plant 
phasing out the fernald uraniumprocessing plant near 
cincinnati and transferring most of its operations to other sites 
the official said this could begin as early as next year the plant 
has been shut down since last summer because of environmental 
problems and no resumption date has been announced

the countrys top business leaders are 
trying to explain the deepest dive in the stock market since the 
october crash of 1987 while they look with concern to the effect 
the plunge will have on their companies 
the thing you think about right away is what is going to 
happen on monday said david t kearns the head of xerox 
the nearly 191point plunge in the dow jones industrial average 
on friday was an unwelcome and surprising intrusion into the fall 
meetings of the business council at a posh resort in the virginia 
mountains 
many of the executives learned about the markets nose dive 
while they were on the golf course or playing tennis 
many executives who were wrapping up their sessions today 
suggested that the drop was the result of spreading problems in the 
junk bond market junk bonds used to finance leveraged 
buyouts have been a driving force behind the markets rise this 
year 
searching for a silver lining to the selloff some business 
leaders said it could end up a positive development if it moderates 
the frenzy of corporate takeovers which are leaving many us 
companies burdened with heavy debt loads 
allen murray chairman of mobil corp said the market plunge 
could turn out to be a good thing if it leads to a flight to 
quality stocks and away from heavy speculation about takeover 
possibilities 
john akers the head of ibm corp said he was concerned a 
takeover epidemic had left many corporations so deeply in debt they 
could be in serious trouble the next time interest rates increase 
after surveying the damage the business leaders are wondering 
whether the market will stabilize on monday or continue falling 
anytime you have the market drop by 191 points if you 
arent concerned theres something wrong with you said john 
mcgillicuddy head of manufacturers hanover corp 
still many are sticking to the upbeat forecast of economic 
prospects for next year that the business leaders had offered 
before the stock market plunge 
they had said economic growth would slow significantly next year 
but that the country should be able to avoid a recession they 
forecast growth would rebound in 1991 
some noting the sharp economic rebound following the 508point 
plunge of oct 19 1987 dismissed the new dive as a oneday shock 
which did nothing to shake their belief in continued prosperity 
i dont think this says anything about the overall economy 
said general motors chairman roger b smith this was a reaction 
to leveraged buyouts 
rand araskog the chairman of itt said he hoped the markets 
plunge signaled politicians that more government regulation is 
needed to curb the wave of corporate takeovers 
the whole thing is a lot of nonsense and it should be 
stopped he said we have a very nervous marketplace

congress and president bush are facing two 
impending budget struggles following senate passage of a 14 
billion deficitreduction bill that was stripped clean of billions 
of dollars of spending items and tax breaks 
the chambers 877 passage of the fiscal 1990 deficitcutting 
legislation late friday set the stage for what could be difficult 
negotiations between the senate and house on a compromise version 
of the bill 
unless bush signs the compromise into law by monday impossible 
because house members are away for the weekend 16 billion in 
defense and domestic spending cuts will take effect that day the 
fiscal year began oct 1 
the deal worked out between democratic and republican leaders 
also left the bill minus a capital gains tax cut that has been a 
priority for bush putting off that partisan showdown 
most members of the senate which the democrats dominate 5545 
favor a capital gains reduction but republicans were unable to 
gather the 60 votes they needed to get that measure attached to the 
deficit bill 
were putting aside capital gains today but i can promise 
well be back ready to win ready to prevail at the earliest 
opportunity said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
this was a major defeat for the president senate majority 
leader george mitchell of maine told reporters later he said the 
administration expended more energy and effort on the capital 
gains fight than it had on any issue this year 
after a week of contentious debate senators agreed to pare the 
legislation to items that raise 53 billion in taxes and cut about 
87 billion in spending gone were expanded child care efforts an 
extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone calls new programs to 
promote sales of crops ranging from soybeans to kiwi fruit and 
other provisions 
the deal was cemented shortly before final passage when senators 
voted by voice to strip the socalled extraneous items from the 
bill slicing the legislation from 1376 pages to about 200 
were putting a deficitreduction bill back in the category of 
being a deficitreduction bill said senate budget committee 
chairman james sasser dtenn 
lawmakers are likely to renew their fight over items that dont 
make the final housesenate compromise bill in new tax legislation 
congress will consider probably in two or three weeks senators 
said 
the bill contains about two dozen new or increased taxes mostly 
on corporations 
departing international air travelers would face a doubling of 
the current 3 tax some farm workers would have income taxes 
withheld for the first time and a new tax would be imposed on 
producers of chemicals that destroy the ozone layer of the 
atmosphere 
the measure also would cut medicare spending by more than 2 
billion mainly by reducing payments to doctors and hospitals 
it also is rife with gimmicky provisions congress and bush 
agreed to months ago nearly 18 billion in claimed savings come 
from no longer counting the postal services operating losses in 
budget calculations hundreds of millions of more in savings 
arise from shifting payments planned for this year into future 
years 
the house passed its own 11 billion version of the measure 
containing dozens of specialinterest provisions of its own on 
oct 5 
that measure contained a twoyear capital gains tax cut a child 
care expansion a rollback of yearold medicare benefits for 
elderly patients who need lengthy hospital stays and new medicaid 
initiatives 
congressional leaders have said they expect the automatic cuts 
under grammrudman to be rolled back when the deficitreduction 
bill is signed into law

ferdinand marcos was eulogized by a longtime 
supporter friday as a person much like jesus christ betrayed by 
the misguided will of the people but forgiving to those who had 
wronged him 
christ was a victim of the peoples power so marcos was a 
victim of the peoples power said roman catholic monsignor 
domingo nebres of the philippines referring to the 1986 people 
power revolt that ended marcos dictatorial rule and forced him 
into exile in hawaii 
my dear beloved president would say do not cry for me 
cry for your country nebres told the 1500 family members 
dignitaries and supporters who packed the cocathedral of st 
theresa the largest roman catholic church in honolulu 
the funeral mass took place even as it remained uncertain where 
the former philippine president will be buried 
marcos coffin draped with a philippine flag arrived at about 
630 pm borne by 10 pallbearers wearing white philippine military 
uniforms and black armbands all were former philippine military 
officials including col arturo aruiza marcos closest adviser 
during his threeyear exile in hawaii 
marcos widow imelda was accompanied by two of her children 
ferdinand bong bong marcos jr and daughter irene araneta as 
well as other relatives 
mrs marcos was clad entirely in black including a black veil 
covering her face and clutched a silver rosary she did not answer 
reporters questions 
a standingroom only crowd filled the cocathedral of st 
theresa dozens of people waited outside the church trying to peer 
inside 
mrs marcos sat in the front row as marcos coffin was brought 
to the front of the church aruiza stood at full military rest near 
marcos whose casket was surrounded by white flowers 
the body was to be returned to nuuanu mortuary for entombment 
sunday at the valley of the temples memorial park 
at least eight marcos security guards as well as two honolulu 
police officers on special duty and an unknown number of fbi agents 
attended the service 
we are most concerned about making sure the service is 
dignified and to protect the people inside said rev daniel 
mcnichol the churchs rector 
philippine consul general to hawaii tomas gomez said there were 
no official representatives of his government at the funeral 
however several philippine congressmen attended including former 
labor minister blas ople and congressman roquito ablan jr said 
marcos supporter joe lazo 
lazo also said christina ponce enrile wife of sen juan ponce 
enrile the former defense minister would attend as well as the 
wife of philippine gen fabian ver marcos righthand man during 
his rule fabian vers whereabouts are unknown and he is a fugitive 
from justice 
marcos who ruled the philippines for 20 years died here sept 
28 following a long illness 
supporters are constructing what they call a temporary resting 
place for marcos body which has been at his hillside 
homeinexile since the day of his death 
work continued friday on the airconditioned shed at valley of 
the temples memorial park marcos family spokesman arturo aruiza 
said he expects the wood and corrugated metal structure to be 
completed by sunday when marcos remains are to be moved to the 
cemetery 
mrs marcos has vowed to bury him in the philippines but 
philippine president corazon aquino has banned his return even in 
death 
the philippine government friday claimed marcos family has 
plotted to kill mrs aquino and asked the supreme court to uphold 
her ban on returning his body to the philippines for burial 
the claim was made in a brief filed with the court asking it to 
reject a petition by marcos supporters to allow members of marcos 
family to return his remains from hawaii 
marcos was ousted in a 1986 popular revolt that catapulted mrs 
aquino to power he was exiled to hawaii where he was subsequently 
indicted by the us government for allegedly looting his nations 
treasury 
mrs marcos has said having her husbands body entombed above 
ground in the guarded shed would make it easier to return his 
remains to the philippines if mrs aquino changes her mind or if 
the philippine supreme court overturns the ban

a robot with a neutron 
ray gun that spots deadly corrosion in air force jets could become 
an important weapon in ensuring the safety of the nations aging 
commercial airliners 
the new computercontrolled machine is being programmed to test 
f111 fighterbombers and other planes inside a specially built 
hangar at this sacramentoarea base 
even before it goes into daytoday use in mid1990 the federal 
aviation administration has commissioned a study to see if versions 
of the 73 million hangar would be practical for use on civilian 
airliners 
the new machine can scan an entire airliner in a period of 
hours zeroing in on problem spots say the private engineers who 
designed it 
youve got to find that achilles heel said doug froom the 
civilian air force employee who designed the device thats what 
this system is good at 
the safety of the nations passenger jets has taken on new 
significance since a section of fuselage peeled off the top of an 
aloha airlines boeing 737 over hawaii in april 1988 that accident 
which killed a flight attendant was blamed on metal fatigue in the 
airliners skin 
the faa responded by ordering airlines to inspect the outside of 
their planes more thoroughly for cracks that could indicate metal 
fatigue and earlier this month the agency revealed it was 
preparing a series of orders requiring airlines to regularly strip 
the insides of airliners to check for corrosion a problem similar 
to metal fatigue 
the nray say its designers could take the place of the 
timeconsuming searches the faa will order 
the corrosiondetector at mcclellan shoots neutrons one of the 
particles that makes up the atom through a plane to a receiver on 
the other side 
neutrons penetrate metal but are absorbed by the hydrogen in the 
dust produced by corrosion the neutron flow is translated into a 
television image that inspectors can watch and record 
the scanner is held by a flexible arm operated by remote 
control inside a hangar with concrete walls thick enough to contain 
errant lowlevel radiation the designers say the radiation isnt a 
health threat to workers who follow safety precautions 
but airline industry representatives said the machine has major 
drawbacks not the least of which is its high cost they also cited 
radiation fears though those arent considered a problem at the 
air force installation and the potential difficulty of adjusting 
the machine to scan airliners 
boeing co spokesman jack gamble asked to list objections other 
than cost said im not going to give 10 reasons why we dont 
want to use it its a technical question 
consumer groups which have criticized existing inspection 
efforts as outdated and inadequate said they want to make sure the 
controversy over the nray centers on the devices effectiveness 
rather than its cost 
if it reveals corrosion in the places in which traditionally 
its been hard to find then what price safety said richard 
livingston of the international airline passengers association 
its hard to imagine anything costing too much to safeguard human 
life 
the firm that built the robot cimcorp robotic systems of st 
paul minn said it could make a machine big enough to scan the 
largest commercial airliner for about 30 million without counting 
the cost of a radiationshielded building to house it 
cimcorps ken bucher contrasted that to the cost of a commercial 
jetliner which runs up to about 125 million for a boeing 747 
you look at that cost against the cost of one airliner and that 
number becomes small again he said 
the air force says the nray device and an adjoining xray 
inspection station similar to those already in use in the industry 
should make back their 287 million cost in two years by saving 
on maintenance spending the nray for example can do in 16 hours 
what human inspectors would need several months to do if they had 
to dismantle the plane 
earlier this year the faa which oversees commercial air 
transportation awarded a new jerseybased research firm galaxy 
scientific corp a 47 million contract to study the nray and 
other inspection techniques

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
proposed a twoyear budget of 198 billion and scolded nations 
that dont pay their dues 
he did not single out any countries but the united states tops 
the list of 66 deadbeats with a debt of more than 495 million as 
of sept 30 
as it is the world body has barely enough money to meet 
expenses through the end of the month the un chief said friday 
perez de cuellar said his 199091 budget projection given to 
the general assembly committee that handles budgetary affairs 
represents a negative rate of real growth of 04 percent 
under the plan personnel would be reduced by 12 percent and 
their would be either no change or a reduction in most expenses 
including travel for staff and consultants 
the only increases in expenditures relate to strictly mandated 
activities notably construction of new premises and technological 
innovations perez de cuellar said 
but the united will face insolvency if not all of the 159 member 
nations pay their dues he said 
the situation is ominous as of yesterday only 66 member 
states had paid their assessments for 1989 in full and had no 
contributions outstanding for prior years he said outstanding 
contributions to the regular budget including arrears amounted 
to 6038 million 
perez de cuellar said the united nations has 68 million left in 
its general fund an amount barely sufficient to cover expenditures 
through october 
us congressional subcommittees have given preliminary approval 
for payment of 2055 million toward the full 1990 fiscal year 
assessment of 216 million they rejected state department requests 
for 46 million more to pay about 10 percent of the arrears citing 
us budgetary constraints 
beginning in 1985 the reagan administration began withholding 
us dues to protest what it said was antiwestern bias 
inefficiency and budget overruns 
in september 1988 reagan said un austerity measures warranted 
payment of back dues a job passed to the bush administration

treasury secretary nicholas f brady is 
reassuring the nation the largest decline in the stock market since 
the 1987 crash will not hurt the real economy that provides 
americans with jobs and stable prices 
the outlook is good for continued moderate growth said 
brady who issued a statement two hours after the market closed 
friday 
he was the only senior government official to comment on the 
stunning almost 191point drop of the dow jones industrial average 
president bush refused to answer reporters shouted questions 
while boarding a helicopter at the white house on his way to his 
camp david retreat in maryland 
a spokesman for the federal reserve board said the central bank 
would have no comment securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard breeden in his second full day on the job was equally 
tightlipped 
todays decline should be viewed in the context of a 
591point rise since jan 1 1989 brady said 
its important to recognize that todays stock market decline 
doesnt signal any fundamental change in the condition of the 
economy he said the economy remains well balanced and the 
outlook is for continued moderate growth 
private economists generally agreed even though the labor 
department said friday that wholesale inflation shot up a worrisome 
09 percent in september analysts said the increase was due 
largely to a onetime climb in energy prices and a statistical 
fluke in the measurement of auto prices 
also economists pointed to an unexpected 05 percent rise in 
retail sales last month as evidence the economy although growing 
more slowly than last year retained some strength 
traders said the stock plummet was triggered by the failure of a 
managementlabor group to arrange financing for a takeover of 
united airlines parent company that hurt takeoverrelated stocks 
which in turn dragged down the market generally 
i think its a oneday panic said economist david wyss of 
drimcgraw hill a lexington mass forecasting firm i think 
its fairly clear the drop was caused by the united airlines 
deal 
nevertheless analysts said the market turmoil will further 
pressure the federal reserve to lower interest rates the central 
bank has preferred to focus on containing inflation with high 
interest rates but that may soon change according to analysts 
the federal reserve just as it did in 1987 will move to pump 
liquidity into the system and push interest rates significantly 
lower said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer in new york 
im expecting the fed will ease perhaps a full percentage 
point within the next few weeks he said 
meanwhile sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the 
senate banking committee said he was concerned that market trading 
systems be ready to handle heavy volume on monday he said he 
received one report of market makers in the overthecounter market 
brokers who normally stand ready to buy or sell specific stocks 
not listed on an exchange refusing to answer their telephones 
late friday 
thats disturbing riegle said i think one of the lessons 
of two years ago is that its very important that market makers be 
in place and that there be sufficient liquidity to handle whatever 
the volume is 
rep edward markey dmass who chairs the subcommittee 
overseeing market regulation used the crash to renew his campaign 
for restructuring market regulation 
this is the second heart attack two years after the first 
its about time we made the changes necessary to avoid a third

labor secretary elizabeth dole steered the 
heads of pittston co and the united mine workers to their first 
meeting since a bitter strike began six months ago saying its 
time to start the healing 
mrs dole said friday she believed facetoface talks between 
pittston chairman paul douglas and umw president richard trumka 
were the only way to break the long stalemate 
im not a mediator im not here to say i have the answer to 
this complex problem but i do feel now it is time to see if we can 
facilitate the bargaining process she said ultimately it has 
to be resolved between the private parties 
the labor secretary announced she had arranged the meeting for 
this afternoon in her washington office after a factfinding trip 
to the coal fields 
douglas and trumka havent met since 1695 miners in virginia 
west virginia and kentucky went on strike april 5 against pittston 
coal group inc 
facetoface talks between lowerlevel negotiators broke off 
june 7 they resumed in july but have regressed to the point where 
negotiators for the company and union are meeting a few days a 
month in separate rooms with a federal mediator shuttling messages 
back and forth 
the strike has crippled production at pittston and sympathy 
walkouts by tens of thousands of miners at other companies idled 
much of the nations coal production in june and july 
were talking about communities being torn apart and in some 
cases families torn apart mrs dole said after meeting with 
company officials strikers and workers hired to take their place 
in the mines its time to start the healing process 
union leader trumka has asked repeatedly to meet with douglas 
but douglas has declined saying local managers understood 
conditions better than he 
we have our best team at the bargaining table said michael 
odom president of pittstons lebanonbased mining subsidiary odom 
declined to comment on the meeting between trumka and douglas 
wages arent an issue in the strike the union wants a benefits 
and job security package equal to the rest of the coal industry 
the company has declined saying it needs more flexibility in its 
work schedules and costs in order to compete with foreign mines 
the strike has become a rallying point for organized labor 
across the country union leaders contend the company is attempting 
to break the umw with the help of onesided labor laws pittston 
denies it is trying to rid itself of union employees 
mrs dole spoke to many of the 280 pickets at the entrance to a 
mammoth coal preparation plant that 98 striking miners invaded and 
occupied for four days in september 
theyre trying to destroy our union joel phillips a picket

twelve miles away in lebanon one of seven pittston coal group 
employees mrs dole talked to said he was attacked three times on 
his way home from work in august after his truck tires were 
flattened by twisted nails called jackrocks 
with tears in his eyes and his hand in a cast roger helbert of 
russell county said his nose was broken and his fingers crushed by 
large rocks hurled through his car window and windshield 
it was terrible he said 
an official of polands solidarity union visited the coal fields 
wednesday and thursday met with mrs dole thursday and criticized 
the treatment of striking miners 
umw spokesman gene carroll said he believed the labor 
secretarys trip was made in part because the the bush 
administration was embarrassed that the polish labor leader 
complained about this countrys treatment of workers 
mrs dole denied that saying she came to virginia because she 
was frustrated at the long impasse and concerned about the 
suffering of strikers

south koreas main dissident alliance 
today demanded the recall of us ambassador donald gregg and said 
an attack on his residence by radical students was the will of 
the people 
about 400 radical students armed with firebombs and rocks 
battled riot police today at seouls sogang university in the 
second straight day of antiamerican campus protests yankee go 
home protesters shouted 
security was bolstered at all us government facilities 
following the attack friday on greggs official residence national 
police headquarters said today riot police were assigned to the 
us embassy but officials declined to give any details 
chonminyon an alliance of dissident groups defended the 
storming of greggs home by six radical students who hurled 
homemade bombs to distract the korean guards and rampaged through 
the home smashing artwork with iron bars 
gregg and his wife meg who were awakened at dawn by the blast 
of bombs hurled by the attacking radicals escaped unharmed through 
a side entrance the six students were overpowered and arrested by 
riot police 
embassy officials said they would review the security system of 
the residence unlike the us embassy it is not guarded by us 
marines but by korean police 
after the attack about 6000 radical students took part in 
antius protests on 26 campuses in seven cities friday police 
said 
the attack reflected the will of the people chonminyon 
leaders claimed at a news conference where they issued a statement 
calling for an end to close us ties the alliance has dwindled in 
recent months as its policies have alienated public opinion and its 
senior leaders have been jailed 
chonminyon demanded the united states recall gregg saying he 
had helped to support military rule when he was cia station chief 
in seoul in the 1970s we ask you to immediately recall gregg to 
return south koreanus relations to normal the group said in 
its statement 
the radical alliance represented at the news conference by 
several top leaders also called for withdrawal of the 43000 us 
troops based in south korea and an end to us demands for greater 
access to south korean markets 
the presence of us forces on the korean peninsula serves as 
an obstacle to peace in the region the group said 
the students who attacked greggs residence shouted slogans 
calling for the ambassadors recall and an end to us trade 
pressure the united states wants seoul to end import barriers to 
correct a huge trade surplus with washington 
president roh taewoo is to leave sunday for washington for 
talks with president bush and other officials radical groups 
demanded roh abandon the trip charging he was seeking to improve 
us ties to bolster his conservative government 
the government and the main opposition parties condemned the 
attack as the work of a tiny violent minority south korean leaders 
stressed the need to preserve the traditionally close alliance with 
washington 
south koreas radical students claim washington has supported 
authoritarian governments that have ruled south korea for much of 
its history radicals have staged a series of attacks on us 
facilities in recent years 
the radicals have very little support because of their violent 
tactics and extremist views radical protests have declined in 
recent months because of the lack of support

the pilotmanagement group seeking to buy the 
parent of united airlines said the 675 billion deal isnt dead 
despite a failure to obtain financing which sent the stock market 
into a free fall 
it has been a 3year struggle to get where we were this 
morning anyway and this is just another obstacle one of many we 
hope to overcome as we have all along hank krakowski a 
spokesman for the pilots union said friday 
his spoke after the group representing united pilots and 
management announced it had failed to get adequate financing for 
its bid to buy ual corp parent of the nations secondlargest 
airline 
the announcement helped trigger a drop of almost 191 points in 
the dow jones industrial average the biggest point drop since the 
crash of 1987 and cast doubt on the prospect for other 
debtfinanced takeovers 
i think the deal has hit a stumbling block i dont think its 
dead by any means said analyst louis a marckesano who follows 
airlines for janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia i 
think the market overreacted 
the pilotmanagement group said banks arranging financing for 
the proposed 300ashare acquisition of ual indicated they had not 
received sufficient commitments to complete the buyout at that 
price 
but the group which also includes british airways plc said 
it expected to revise the proposal and continue its attempts to buy 
the company 
in london british airways said it was confident the group still 
would be able to raise the necessary financing 
marckesano predicted it would be wednesday before the group 
would be able to say whether it could pull commitments together for 
the deal 
one unanswered question he said is the status of the recently 
rejected bid for ual by california billionaire marvin davis whose 
quest for the company prompted the pilotmanagement group to make 
its offer in august 
jim fingeroth a spokesman for davis said in new york that 
davis had no statement after fridays events davis had bid 619 
billion or 275 a share 
but davis said last month he would be willing to match the 675 
billion buyout offer of the pilotmanagement group if that deal 
collapsed he also said he would demand no labor concessions a 
key point for unions 
nevertheless krakowski said the pilotmanagement bid was 
attractive in large part because it included an employee stock 
ownership plan 
and under current esop tax laws the tax savings available 
allow us to service the debt even in a recession to a much 
greater degree than say a marvin davis or an outside raider 
could he said in an interview on wbbmam radio late friday 
under the proposed offer ual workers would own 75 percent of 
the company management would hold 10 percent and british airways 
would own 15 percent 
ual issued a statement that its board would review any revised 
proposal it received from the pilotmanagement group and would 
review all other financial or strategic alternatives available to 
it 
in september citibank and chase manhattan bank committed 3 
billion to finance the buyout and were to obtain commitments for an 
additional 42 billion 
spokespersons from the two banks did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment friday however a spokesman for british airways 
said he understood the financing collapsed because japanese banks 
dropped out of the deal 
the 7000 union pilots at united had tried to enlist the support 
of the machinists and flight attendants unions but the 
machinists representing 25000 of uniteds 70000 workers 
vehemently opposed the buyout saying it was overpriced and would 
cripple the airline with too much debt 
trading in ual stock was halted because of the groups 
announcement but the airlines shares still fell 550 to close at 
27975 
fridays developments also cast a pall over shares of other 
companies involved in or planning debtfinanced deals they include 
american airlinles parent amr corp subject of a 7 billion 
buyout offer from donald trump

financial analysts predicted global selling 
following the new york stock market plunge but most said it would 
not equal the 1987 crash a hong kong securities director dismissed 
the dip as a us problem 
the secondlargest dive in us history occurred mostly in the 
final hour of trading in new york after markets in tokyo london 
and elsewhere had closed but the fallout was expected to continue 
monday with the reopening of financial markets elsewhere 
us analysts blamed the 19058 decline on collapse of the 
junk bond market which has been used to finance takeovers and 
leveraged buyouts and an increase in the producer price index 
indicating higher inflation 
the times of london said today world stock markets are 
bracing themselves for a rerun of the 1987 crash fund managers 
were forecasting that the fall would lead to a global wave of 
selling although many doubted that it would be at the panic levels 
of 1987 
but in hong kong larry tam director of sun hung kai 
securities said the crash was a us problem he said it probably 
would not greatly affect the hong kong stock market when it 
reopened monday although the index might drop 50 to 60 points 
he said the hong kong market had risen in past days because the 
british colony was planning significant projects such as a new 
airport hong kong traders therefore were confident and probably 
would not be affected he said 
in trading today gold rose 371 an ounce on the hong kong 
market to close at 36740 compared to fridays close of 36369 
in tokyo kazuhiro nomura of new japan securities co said 
the nikkei index might plunge when the tokyo market opens monday 
because japanese investors will be inclined to sell 
he said the tokyo exchange might drop temporarily but in the 
long run the fall in new york would not have a major impact on the 
tokyo market 
since there is no change in japanese economic fundamentals 
the tokyo market will not fall as sharply as in new york just 
because of the plunge on wall street nomura said 
in london alex hammondchambers of the british fund management 
company ivory and sime said i imagine london will follow suit on 
monday we survived that one the 1987 crash and the markets 
have since recovered 
richard jeffrey director of economics at the london securities 
company hoare govett said comparisons with 1987 were unfair 
because many companies were now valued at lower levels 
but he said prices on the london stock market could fall heavily 
when it reopens monday he predicted the financial times share 
price index of 30 leading british companies a major market 
indicator could fall to 1718 monday against 1818 at close friday 
his predicted 100point fall compares with a drop of 1837 
points on oct 19 1987 the first day of the crash two years ago 
jeffrey said the london market had escaped the vogue for junk 
bonds and would be cushioned from a dramatic collapse 
the bank of england in a statement late friday also said the 
us market had been underpinned by leveraged transactions 
but john chiene chairman of the british investment bank county 
natwest wood mackenzie said our london stock market has been 
in a delicate condition for some time given the extent to which we 
have been tracking wall street this news is likely to have a 
significant adverse impact on monday 
london stock market prices have been weak as the value of the 
british pound continued to slip despite high interest rates 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government on 
oct 5 increased british interest rates by one percentage point to 
15 percent following rate increases by west germany and five other 
european countries 
the financial times 30share index closed late friday 398 
points lower over the week 
terry connor from the london finance house robert fleming 
said sentiment in london was already nervous its reminiscent 
of 1987 and almost anything can happen 
given the fear element and the closeness of the anniversary of 
the 1987 crash we are in for a very nervous monday

president bush says he still wants panamanian 
ruler manuel antonio noriega out of power but that doesnt mean 
hes giving a carte blanche for use of us military troops to 
help remove him 
bush continuing to defend his decision not to intervene in the 
failed coup attempt by panamanian military officers last week 
said i wouldnt mind using force if it could be done in a 
prudent manner 
but he said i hope i would never be reckless enough as a 
commander in chief to make a blanket commitment to use of force 
without knowing the facts regarding some coup attempt 
he called complaints that he should have used military power to 
back up his repeated calls for panamanians to oust noriega a 
stupid argument that some very erudite people make 
in a brief news conference at the white house bush also avoided 
saying whether he would veto newly passed legislation to loosen 
restrictions on federal funding for abortions he said he still 
opposes giving federal money for abortions for poor women who are 
victims of rape and incest 
but he said he wants to see if there is room for flexibility 
to avoid a veto on my part after senate and house negotiators 
work out a compromise version of a bill on abortion funding 
as to the lack of us military backing for the panamanian 
insurgents who tried to overthrow noriega on oct 3 bush said he 
is not ruling out the use of force for all time 
however he said i am not going to give carte blanche support 
to an operation particularly when they dont ask for this support 
i have at stake the lives of american kids and i am not going 
to easily thrust them into a battle unless i feel comfortable with 
it and unless those general officers in whom i have total 
confidence feel comfortable 
he reiterated that he believes he made the right decisions but 
said his administration was reviewing procedures to see if we 
cant do it better 
he also said it is well worth looking into the complaint by 
the widow of the coup leader adela bonilla de giroldi about poor 
telephone communications during the insurgency 
mrs giroldi said coup leaders were rebuffed when they used a 
telephone number that us authorities had provided for 
emergencies and americans who answered demanded to know why they 
were using the line 
to the degree we can improve our communications fine bush 
said 
as a result of an internal review the administration has 
decided a crisismanagement team will be automatically convened in 
the white house situation room in future emergencies a senior 
official said 
the los angeles times reported in todays editions that the bush 
administration without changing an executive order banning 
assassinations of foreign leaders has chosen to legally interpret 
assassination as referring only to premeditated political 
murder 
a new legal ruling drafted by the office of the army judge 
advocate general would permit clandestine operations even if they 
threaten the lives of foreign figures 
unidentified administration officials quoted by the times said 
the ruling would significantly expand the scope of military 
operations the united states could legally launch against 
terrorists drug lords or fugitives abroad the newspaper reported 
at the news conference bush also said 
he will not veto a bill outlawing flag burning but will let it 
become law without his signature he said he doesnt think the law 
will withstand court challenges and he will push for his preferred 
alternative a constitutional amendment that would accomplish the 
same thing 
he still wants congress to approve his capital gains tax cut 
proposal he did not say he would veto legislation that combined 
his proposal with a democratic version liberalizing individual 
retirement accounts a few hours later senate leaders agreed on a 
plan to strip hundreds of specialinterest provisions from a 141 
billion deficitreduction bill leaving the capital gains fight for 
the future

east germany says the refugee 
exodus has cut significantly into its labor force and its 
communist government is calling on those left behind to help close 
the gap 
we certainly can do more indeed a lot more the state 
newspaper berliner zeitung urged the countrys workers friday 
even before tens of thousands of people many of them skilled 
young workers began fleeing to the west the east germany economy 
was demanding the maximum from its already restive labor force 
more than 90 percent of workingage women hold jobs 
unemployment among ablebodied men is officially nonexistent the 
country has a 44hour work week the longest in europe 
the result is an economy thats the envy of its soviet bloc 
neighbors but also one with increasing problems 
topranking communist party members warned this week of the 
growing possibility of labor strikes which once were unthinkable 
in the tightly controlled society 
the official news agency adn said friday that the refugee exodus 
had created a noticeable decrease of the labor force potential 
and that the current contingent of foreign workers wont be able to 
compensate for the loss 
it put at 85000 the number of workers from vietnam angola 
cuba north korea mozambique and china but some estimates say the 
total is far higher 
the east german leadership would like to hire 80000 more 
chinese to fill vacancies the viennese daily newspaper der 
standard said this week 
about 50000 east germans have fled to west germany since july 
at least 70000 others have emigrated or refused to return after 
being allowed to visit west germany 
to make up for the loss the communist leadership in east berlin 
has increasingly been pressing those left behind to rally around 
the socialist system thats also facing burgeoning political 
opposition 
dont forget that there are still enough gdr east german 
citizens to keep building up the country and who have the will to 
strengthen socialism in the gdr politburo member kurt hager told 
west germanys zdf television on thursday in an interview in moscow 
others took up that same theme friday 
besides urging workers to do more the berliner zeitung called 
for a better mood and greater efficiency on the job 
harry tisch a member of the ruling politburo and head of the 
governmentrun labor federation said millions of people are still 
giving their best for socialism 
now its important to use to an even greater degree this 
potential power readiness richness of ideas and creativity 
tisch said in a commentary in the federations daily newspaper 
tribuene 
as head of the freie deutsche gewerkschaftsbund tisch oversees 
the nations work force of nearly 86 million people recent 
estimates put the countrys population at about 166 million 
before the refugee exodus 
east german leader erich honecker sounded the same theme friday 
saying our motto work together plan together govern together 
is more current than ever 
his comments came in a meeting with leaders of political parties 
allied with the communists held to discuss the recent troubles 
that have hit the nation

investors spooked by a faltering airline buyout 
went on a friday the 13th selling spree that knocked the dow jones 
industrial average into a 190point tailspin eerily reminiscent of 
the crash of 1987 
the chilling slide was concentrated in the last hour of trading 
friday shortly after united airlines parent ual corp announced 
the unraveling of an employeeled 675 billion buyout bid that 
depended heavily on borrowed cash 
nearly 200 billion in paper wealth vanished as investors dumped 
stocks and computerized trading programs went into an 
acrosstheboard sell mode 
its total emotional and psychological chaos said eugene 
peroni an analyst with janney montgomery scott in philadelphia 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady sought to reassure 
americans that the outlook for economic growth remains sound 
its important to recognize that todays stock market decline 
doesnt signal any fundamental change in the condition of the 
economy brady said noting that the decline followed a 591point 
rise in the dow industrials since the start of the year 
president bush new securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard c breeden and the federal reserve all declined comment 
nevertheless some observers saw uncanny parallels with a 
108point dow drop on a friday exactly two years ago which 
presaged the record 508point plunge on black monday oct 19 1987 
nobody believes in witchcraft washington economist michael 
evans said but he added were seeing the same type of 
phenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago 
at days end the widely watched dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks had plunged 19058 points to 256926 the 
biggest point drop since black monday 
on a percentage basis fridays loss was only the 12th worst 
ever 691 percent ranking far behind the record 226 percent 
drop on black monday and the 128 percent decline on oct 28 1929 
which heralded the start of the great depression 
other stock indices fell sharply as investors sought refuge in 
the relatively safe credit markets big investor appetite for bonds 
pushed interest rates down to their lowest levels since april 1987 
unlike two years ago when weeks of increasingly volatile 
trading preceded the crash fridays decline came with little 
warning the dow already had posted five record highs this month 
and the average was down only about 23 points two hours before the 
close of trading 
at the height of the selloff the average plummeted a little 
more than 100 points in an hour 
but there were some similarities 
two years ago worries that congress would restrict in leveraged 
buyouts contributed to the market crash today questions over the 
ability to finance takeovers has the market spooked 
computerized program trading was blamed in part for the 
earlier crash and analysts said it contributed to the latest dive 
though safeguards installed since october 1987 were said to have 
lessened the effect 
adding to the feeling of deja vu the administration and 
congress were wrestling once again with the budget deficit and a 
surge in wholesale prices reported friday renewed fear that 
inflation may worsen 
some analysts played down the similarities 
i think its a oneday panic said economist david wyss of 
drimcgraw hill a lexington mass forecasting firm i think 
its fairly clear the drop was caused by the united airlines 
deal 
news that financing for the ual deal had broken down heightened 
concerns that the takeover fever supporting stock prices may be 
over brokers said the buyout of the nations secondlargest 
airline would have relied largely on the sale of highrisk 
highyielding junk bonds commonly used to finance leveraged 
buyouts 
leveraged buyouts have been the principal drive to stock 
prices this year and if that prop gets removed stocks would 
have to go down said hugh johnson senior vice president at 
first albany corp 
the market for junk bonds was shaken last month when canadian 
retailing giant campeau corp announced it was unable to make 
payments on bonds it issued in buyouts of allied stores corp and 
federated department stores inc 
following the 1987 crash regulators imposed what they called 
circuit breakers that automatically limited trading if the dow 
industrials rose or fell 50 points this restriction was later 
expanded to 250 points 
in chicago similar circuit breakers went into effect for the 
first time the mercantile exchange said trading of futures on the 
standard amp poors 500 index was halted twice 
new york stock exchange president richard a grasso said the 
safeguard intended to blunt the effect of computerized program 
trading worked exceptionally well friday 
nevertheless janney montgomerys peroni said the severe drop 
raised worries over what will happen monday its bad because it 
means that theres going to be two days for fear to fester

more than 11000 vietnamese boat people in 
detention centers throughout this british colony today staged a 
hunger strike to protest forced repatriation to their communist 
homeland officials reported 
nearly all the 7000 inhabitants in the shek kong detention 
center refused to have breakfast and lunch saturday said a police 
spokesman on condition of anonymity she added boat people hung 
banners in the camp saying do not repatriate us to vietnam 
a government spokesman said 4100 boat people in detention 
centers in shatin and on lantao island also stopped eating 
the actions came before meetings in geneva monday and tuesday 
that will review plans to screen vietnamese boat people and 
repatriate those who do not qualify as refugees 
under a policy adopted by hong kong and many southeast asian 
nations in june 1988 vietnamese boat people will be granted 
refugee status and resettled overseas only if they can prove they 
fled political persecution in vietnam otherwise they would be 
considered illegal immigrants and face repatriation 
the government spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said pamphlets had been found in some camps urging the boat people 
to hold rallies and hunger strikes against the screening policy 
he said there were no incidents of disorder and the hunger 
strikers did not pose any security threat 
more than 56000 boat people are in hong kong twothirds of 
them are kept in the prisonlike centers waiting to be screened 
in august vietnamese battled each other with iron bars stones 
and sharpened objects at one detention center seventeen people 
were injured

the verdicts in from experts who dug up the 
common grave of five colorado gold prospectors to see who did them 
in and ate them up alferd packer was the murderer with an appetite 
for his victims 
guilty as sin intoned james e starrs a professor of law 
and forensic science who led an expedition to lake city colo to 
show what experts in archeology anthropology pathology and 
firearms could learn about misdeeds committed 115 years ago 
starrs said friday the bones provided scientific evidence that 
prove packer beyond the shadow of a doubt murdered his 
colleagues marooned in the rocky mountains during the murderous 
winter of 1874 and ate their flesh to stay alive 
it was a famous case of cannibalism and the stuff of legends 
packer accused of killing his fellow prospectors in 1874 was 
convicted of murder in 1883 and of five charges of manslaughter 
three years later when the first conviction was overturned on a 
technicality 
he owned up to surviving on the flesh of his fellow travelers 
but said the only one he actually killed was a hungercrazed 
shannon wilson bell 
he said bell rushed him with a hatchet when he returned empty 
handed from a fiveday sortie in search for food he said bell had 
killed the others and cannibalized them 
he said he shot bell in selfdefense finished him off with the 
hatchet and then survived the winter through cannibalism 
but the bones showed contradictory evidence starrs said 
it is plain as a pikestaff that packer was the one who was on 
the attack not bell he said explaining that wounds on the 
bones of three of the victims were caused by a hatchetlike 
instrument at a time when these persons were defending themselves 
from the attack of an aggressor 
he said the marks suggested the victims had raised their arms to 
fend off blows 
starrs said the angle of the blade marks on the bones from which 
the flesh had been taken including the bones believed to be 
bells indicated that the cuts were all made by the same person 
that indicates packers story is false and that hes guilty he 
said 
however starrs acknowledged his findings had their limits he 
said for example he could not be sure which set of bones was 
bells 
anthropologist walter h birkby of the arizona state museum who 
also studied the bones said he couldnt share starrs conclusions 
it could possibly be the right scenario but scientifically we 
cannot substantiate it birkby said 
last summer birkby went further saying his study of the remains 
actually supported packers story 
no matter what his proclivities toward his fellow man packer 
has been a fixture in colorado folk history his bust has been 
displayed in the state capitol 
students at the university of colorado at boulder named their 
student center dining room after packer 
part of his fame comes from a remark starrs said was never 
uttered judge melville gerry upon sentencing packer supposedly 
declared they was sivin dimmicrats in hinsdale county and ye 
eat five of them god damn ye 
starrs said he believes the quotation was made up by a bartender 
starrs also came to one conclusion not far off the opinion many 
people held in the last century packer was a fiend base 
brutish barbaric he said 
one remaining mystery was cleared up when duane j dillon a 
criminal investigator from martinez calif concluded packer 
spelled his first name alferd 
he said official records show the name as alfred but 
whenever packer signed a document he used alferd

the justice minister resigned citing 
deterioration of his health and neglect of his ranch during the six 
weeks he held office an adviser to gen manuel antonio noriega was 
named to replace him 
a journalist for the madrid newspaper el pais took refuge in the 
spanish embassy friday saying he had been threatened with arrest 
the opposition indicated friday it would discuss conditions for 
new elections 
olmedo miranda was appointed sept 3 two days after provisional 
president francisco rodriguez took office the provisional 
government was created when noriega annulled the may 7 elections 
which independent observers said the opposition won by a landslide 
renato pereira a foreign relations expert and adviser to 
noriega was appointed to replace miranda after mirandas 
resignation friday 
in his resignation letter to rodriguez miranda said i have 
faced mainly damage to my health while in office and in 
addition i have neglected the duties of my cattle business 
his resignation followed government announcements that onethird 
of the 140000 public employees could be fired over the next weeks 
under tough new laws against workers deemed disloyal to the 
government 
many public employees celebrated oct 3 when rebellious 
military units tried to overthrow noriega who as chief of the 
defense forces controls the country 
the new measures make it easy for the government to dismiss such 
employees the laws also freeze wages suspend christmas bonuses 
and forbid any political activity by professional and business 
associations 
the government said the laws were enacted to defend the economy 
against aggression by the united states 
since noriegas indictment in february 1988 on us drug 
trafficking charges the united states has applied economic and 
political pressure to force the defense forces chief to step down 
noriega denies the drug charges and says the united states is 
trying to avoid complying with the 1977 panama canal treaties 
which give panama control of the waterway at the end of 1999 
the spanish journalist antonio cano said officials called him 
at his hotel criticized a story he had written about noriega and 
threatened him with arrest he said he wrote a profile with 
references to noriegas personal life 
cano 32 lives in mexico and has covered panama since 1984 he 
arrived last week to report on the military uprising 
government officials were not available for comment on the 
reported threats 
cano said he called spanish officials who took him to the 
embassy for protection and were looking for ways to get him out of 
the country 
former presidential candidate guillermo endara said the 
opposition was willing to talk with the military about another 
kind of elections but would continue to insist on noriegas 
departure and recognition of its may victory 
international observers said endara beat the government 
candidate by a 31 margin 
we would be willing to hold talks on many grounds endara 
said if gen noriega is willing to leave we would be willing to 
consider what kind of elections could be held

more than 1500 people crowded into a sweltering 
church to hear former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
eulogized as a man who suffered like jesus christ and forgave those 
who betrayed him 
another 500 people milled outside the cocathedral of st 
theresa friday hoping for a glimpse of marcos body friday evening 
christ was a victim of the peoples power so marcos was a 
victim of the peoples power said roman catholic monsignor 
domingo nebres of the philippines referring to the 1986 people 
power revolt that ended marcos 20year dictatorial rule there 
my dear beloved president would say do not cry for me 
cry for your country nebres a friend of marcos for 12 years 
told those packed into the honolulus largest roman catholic church 
after the mass nebres told reporters we cannot imitate 
christ in power he is god we can only imitate him in suffering 
which marcos did 
marcos was hospitalized for nearly nine months before he died 
sept 28 at the age of 72 
last year he was indicted on us criminal racketeering charges 
accusing him of looting millions of dollars from his homeland 
in exile he was accused of plotting to overthrow philippine 
president corazon aquino who prohibited him from returning to his 
homeland 
but his widow imelda who still faces the racketeering charges 
has vowed to bring his body home to the philippines for burial he 
will be entombed sunday at valley of the temples memorial park in 
what the family calls a temporary resting place 
despite being rejected by his people marcos was never bitter 
nebres said he would say lord forgive them they know not what 
they do said the priest who regularly heard marcos 
confessions 
marcos coffin draped with a philippine flag was carried into 
the church by 10 men in white philippine military uniforms and 
black armbands eight were retired generals 
the procession was led by col arturo aruiza a 20year marcos 
aide and his closest adviserinexile 
mrs marcos arrived with two of her three children ferdinand 
bong bong marcos jr and daughter irene araneta as well as 
other relatives including marcos sister fortuna barba and 
brother pacifico marcos 
marcos eldest daughter imee lives in exile in morocco 
the blackclad mrs marcos who covered her face with a black 
veil and clutched a silver rosary refused to answer reporters 
questions 
during the service a tearful aruiza stood guard near marcos 
closed coffin which was surrounded by white flowers and red velvet 
ropes to keep mourners from getting too close 
after the hourlong mass the coffin was opened mrs marcos 
kissed the clear plastic covering it and placed a single white lily 
there 
throngs of mourners including hundreds who pushed their way 
into the church after rain began to fall at the end of the mass 
filed past the coffin 
philippine consul general to hawaii tomas gomez said there were 
no official representatives of the philippine or us governments 
at the funeral 
however several philippine officials attended including former 
labor minister blas ople and congressman roquito ablan jr said 
marcos supporter joe lazo 
also attending were eduardo cojuangco jr christina ponce 
enrile wife of sen juan ponce enrile the former defense 
minister and the wife of philippine gen fabian ver marcos

the bush administration has decided that 
clandestine us operations that threaten the lives of foreign 
leaders could be legal despite a ban on assassinations according 
to a published report 
without changing an executive order banning assassinations of 
foreign leaders the administration will legally interpret 
assassination as referring only to premeditated political 
murder the los angeles times reported today 
the new legal ruling drafted by the office of the army judge 
advocate general would significantly expand the scope of military 
operations the united states could launch legally against 
terrorists drug lords or fugitives abroad the times said citing 
unidentified administration officials 
the ruling comes as the administration weathers congressional 
criticism of its handling of last weeks failed coup against 
panamas gen manuel noriega 
under the ruling the accidental death of noriega during an 
extradition or future coup attempt in which us forces played a 
direct role wouldnt constitute assassination the times reported 
similarly the death of a hostagetaker during a rescue attempt 
by us forces or a drug trafficker who intervened violently 
during a usassisted raid on narcotics labs abroad would be 
exempt from the assassination order officials said 
it would just be their bad luck said one official 
barred under the order bar is premeditated political murder 
that means a man standing on a rooftop with a sniper scope aiming 
at a predetermined target said one senior administration legal 
counsel 
president fords 1975 executive order barring assassination has 
been viewed by later administrations as a barrier to covert 
intelligence operations that put the lives of targets at risk the 
paper said 
none of the executive orders defined the term assassination 
which created a lot of confusion a pentagon official said 
this ruling takes away the excuse for indecision 
the memorandum of law states a decision by the president 
to employ overt military force would not constitute 
assassination if us forces were employed against the combatant 
forces of another nation a guerrilla force or a terrorist or 
other organization whose actions pose a threat to the security of 
the united states 
in contrast the last executive order on assassinations issued 
by president reagan in 1981 states simply no person employed by 
or acting on behalf of the united states government shall engage in 
or conspire to engage in assassination 
it also says that no agency of the intelligence community 
shall participate in or request any person to undertake activities 
forbidden by this order 
the new 15page ruling received input from the cia the state 
department other us agencies and members of congress 
one administration official said the ruling was the direct 
result of the changing international threat which was previously 
viewed in terms of conventional forces but today includes terrorism 
and narcoterrorism

pope john paul ll arrived today for 
a twoday stay in this multiparty democracy in which a rainbow of 
races and religions coexist peacefully 
the roman catholic leader landed in cloudy windy weather on 
this volcanic indian ocean island after a 7hour flight from 
jakarta indonesia 
prime minister anerood jugnauth greeted the pope with hindu 
christian and moslem members of his government 
john pauls weekend stop follows a politically sensitive asian 
pilgrimage in which he was called to speak out on human rights 
issues in south korea and indonesia 
on sunday john paul will visit the 50squaremile island of 
rodrigues 500 miles to the east before returning to rome monday 
at his final stops on his tour of indonesia on friday john paul 
stressed the catholic churchs family and social teachings while 
acknowledging difficulties faced by indonesias christians 
he continued to use guarded language when referring to potential 
controversial issues involving the government or the 157 
millionmember moslem community in the worlds most populous moslem 
country 
his final indonesian mass was attended by 100000 people friday 
amid lush coffee and palm oil plantations in north sumatra later 
he addressed indonesias 42 bishops in jakarta the capital 
john paul urged catholics to be bold in proclaiming christian 
values he acknowledged occasional difficulties facing the 5 
million catholics in indonesia but reminded them religious freedom 
is protected by indonesias constitution 
in mauritius hindus account for just over half of its 1 million 
people about 320000 are catholics and 16 percent are moslems 
hindus and moslems emigrated from india in the 19th century to 
mauritius 1000 miles east of the african mainland 
catholicism was brought by the french when they settled in 1721 
the british gained control and granted mauritius independence in 
1968 
it has a multiparty parliamentary democracy a free press and a 
commitment to separation of religion and state 
cardinal jean margeot head of the nations catholics addressed 
a letter to all mauritians asking them to welcome the pope as a 
pilgrim of peace 
may each of the different groups of our society keep its own 
identity like the colors of the rainbow and seek elevation 
mutually said margeot 
unity in diversity is the motto of the prime minister sir 
anerood jugnauth 59 a hindu who has five catholics in his cabinet 
and a picture of the pope on his office wall 
however hindus twice tried to assassinate jugnauth after he 
launched a crackdown against the drug trade last year 
but margeot said he will have good news for the pope about 
mauritius which has almost full employment and a real growth rate 
that has averaged 7 percent in recent years 
we are changing from a rural economy based on agriculture to 
accelerated industrialization the cardinal said 
most of the population are creoles whose skin color ranges from 
fairest white to darkest black with racial features of europeans 
africans and indians and a touch of chinese all the ethnic 
variety of the indian subcontinent is also represented 
mauritius is considered a shining example of peaceful 
coexistence american novelist mark twain once described it as the 
model for paradise

jewish students at the university of 
california at berkeley have demanded a formal apology from 
sociology professor harry edwards for his refusal to cancel an exam 
scheduled on yom kippur 
edwards a prominent civil rights advocate gave the exam on 
monday the jewish day of atonement despite pleas from 47 students 
in his 500student introductory sociology class 
edwards refused to reschedule the exam saying if he made an 
exception for yom kippur he would have to make exceptions for 
numerous other religions 
as an alternative edwards told students who wanted to observe 
the most sacred of jewish holidays to write a long paper but some 
students considered that an unfair option 
i dont believe he is antisemitic said sociology student 
naomi snyder who did not attend synagogue or fast on the holiday 
because she decided to take the exam i do believe he is 
insensitive 
edwards who did not immediately return phone calls was quoted 
in other news reports as saying he disregarded holidays that were 
not on the university calendar 
edwards organized the clenchedfist protest by black athletes at 
the 1968 olympic games in mexico city and more recently has 
consulted on affirmative action issues for footballs san francisco 
49ers basketballs golden state warriors and former baseball 
commissioner peter ueberroth 
its ironic that as a civil rights leader and a person whose 
job it is to educate students about diversity that he was so 
outright closeminded about accommodating jewish students said 
shana silverberg president of the universitys jewish student 
board 
silverberg said her group and the berkeley hillel foundation 
were requesting a meeting with edwards to discuss the episode

a federal judge has given final approval to a 
78 million settlement of a class action lawsuit over radioactive 
pollution from the federal governments fernald uranium processing 
plant 
us district judge carl b rubin ruled friday that the 
settlement with 14000 residents and businesses within five miles 
of the plant leaves mobil mining amp minerals co which has an 
operation near the plant free to sue the us department of energy 
to recover costs of cleaning up radioactive pollution on mobil 
property 
district judge s arthur spiegel ruled earlier this month that 
the settlement offered by the federal government which owns the 
feed materials processing center was reasonable for resolving the 
classaction claim 
the plaintiffs said radioactive pollution had reduced their 
property values and inflicted emotional suffering the plant has 
processed uranium for use in nuclear reactors and weapons since 
1952 
mobil and rutgersnease chemical co commercial neighbors of 
the plant had objected to the settlement because they feared it 
could block lawsuits they might file for repayment from the federal 
government if the state were to order the companies to clean up 
pollution on their properties 
spiegel ruled that the settlement did not prevent rutgersnease 
from filing such suits but he removed himself from ruling on the 
mobil claim because his family owns mobil stock 
the settlement calls for the energy department to deposit 73 
million in a courtsupervised fund for the neighbors by oct 15 
the department has promised to pay another 5 million for valid 
claims of lost commercial property value

india postponed the withdrawal of its 
peacekeeping troops in eastern sri lanka after a dispute over who 
will provide security in the violencewracked area officials said 
today 
about 5000 indian soldiers had been expected to leave eastern 
ampara district monday military sources said but an indian high 
commission official said the troops would remain in the district 
125 miles east of colombo 
the problem of the withdrawal from ampara is because nothing 
has been sorted out about who will take over security of the 
district when the indian peacekeeping force pulls out will it be 
the sri lankan army the police or the civil volunteer force the 
official said on condition of anonymity 
india sent an estimated 47000 troops to sri lanka in july 1987 
to supervise an arms surrender of tamil guerrillas fighting for an 
independent homeland in the north and east 
but the rebels turned their guns on the indian soldiers whose 
presence also triggered a bloody backlash by sinhalese radicals 
the ultranationalists argued the government made too many 
concessions to the tamils and they said the indian troops 
threatened sri lankan sovereignty 
india has said all its soldiers will leave the island by dec 31 
foreign minister rajan wijeratne said friday some indian troops 
would board ships in eastern trincomalee harbor and return home 
monday under a withdrawal plan worked out by top military officials 
from the neighboring countries 
but indian diplomats and sri lanka military officials who cannot 
be identified under briefing rules said the pullout was delayed 
the action plan to fill the vacuum when the indian troops 
leave has not been sorted out said one indian diplomat on 
condition of anonymity we have not got any response from the sri 
lanka government about who is taking over when the peacekeeping 
force leaves 
the northeast provincial council headed by a former tamil rebel 
group known as the eelam peoples revolutionary front has 
organized a volunteer force of mostly tamil and moslem civilians to 
take over when the indian soldiers leave 
the front also said it plans to organize a 30000strong tamil 
army to take over security operations in the area but wijeratne 
said the sri lankan army and police would take over after indian 
soldiers leave 
president ranasinghe premadasa had demanded that all indian 
soldiers leave sri lanka by july 29 the second anniversary of the 
signing of the peace accord but indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
refused saying a hasty pullout could lead to more bloodshed 
the crisis was averted after india made a token pullout and the 
two governments later reached an agreement for the withdrawal of 
the remaining troops 
tamils who are mostly hindus comprise 18 percent of the 
islands 16 million people they claim they are denied jobs and 
education by the predominantly buddhist sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population and dominate the government and military 
more than 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
died since the tamil insurgency began in 1983 another 5000 have 
been killed in the 2yearold sinhalese rebellion

the friday the 13th computer virus turned out to be something 
less than an epidemic but one computer expert said today that 
public fascination with the quirky ailment may heighten interest in 
computer security 
reports so far indicated infections at 75 sites worldwide by a 
pair of viruses designed to strike friday the 13th said wes 
thomas editor of an electronic newsletter called virus alert 
those 75 sites mostly businesses and universities account for 
hundreds of computers he said 
thomas who set up a command center in san francisco to 
coordinate reports of the viruses and the response said he hadnt 
heard of any serious damage done but said corporate computer 
managers were closemouthed about data loss 
people dont want to admit that thomas said after a night 
of monitoring calls 
its obviously not a massive infestation thomas said 
adding that most of the reported cases had yet to be checked by 
experts 
viruses are malicious programs written by technovandals the 
bugs are spread by unknowing users through infected computer disks 
or contaminated programs drawn from telephone bulletin boards or 
computer networks they can sap computing power fill up storage 
space devour files or make information impossible to get 
in britain the royal national institution for the blind 
reported a computer malfuction that was most likely caused by a 
virus according to bernard fleming community education officer 
we found that most of our program files are gone every time 
we try to look at a new program file it vanishes in front of our 
eyes said corri barrett of the institute in london its 
horrendous months and months of work has been wiped out here 
in switzerland bernhard schmid head of the federal personal 
computer team said several dozen of the governments 3500 
personal computers were found to have been carrying a virus but 
experts managed to cancel and reprogram all the infected ones 
a virus was detected earlier in the week in personal computers 
at mobil corp offices in tyler texas and houston said gale 
maynor who runs the companys computer support services in dallas 
the bug erupted early because managers advanced their computers 
clocks to smoke it out she said vital data was duplicated in 
advance she said 
to thomas the nonepidemic may have the unexpected benefit of 
raising computer users awareness of the possibility of a virus 
there are a number of viruses and they could hit at any 
time he said the trouble is there are not a lot of people 
trained to recognize this 
his advice to users who notice their machines acting strangely 
is to shut the computer off and call an expert to diagnose the 
problem 
about 30 viruses are known to exist they are often triggered by 
computers internal calendars and friday the 13th is a favorite 
target date 
a virus known as datacrime or the columbus day virus was 
supposed to be activated on the 13th it erases a computers 
track zero the part of the memory the machine uses to locate 
files 
another that has been around for some time called the 
jerusalem the israeli or the plo virus kicks in friday the 13th 
its action is described by various computer experts as destroying 
files or expanding applications programs causing them to 
malfunction

of the outlawed african national congress and chanted as they 
paraded through the city center to a rally at a university campus 
there also were peaceful marches in cape town durban port 
elizabeth and several smaller cities 
the government announced tuesday that anc leader walter sisulu 
77 and seven other jailed antiapartheid leaders would be freed 
it was expected the eight ranging in age from 60 to 80 would be 
freed on sunday 
the most prominent jailed anc leader nelson mandela will 
remain in prison but his release is expected within the next few 
months unless the government fears widespread disorder would ensue 
sisulu mandela and four other prisoners about to be freed were 
sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for planning a sabotage 
campaign to undermine the whiteminority government 
the marches initially were planned as protests against labor 
legislation which black trade unions view as an attempt to cripple 
their ability to strikeantiapartheid leaders later declared the 
rallies also would be victory marches 
we are the majority jay naidoo general secretary of the 
congress of south african trade unions told an estimated 10000 
marchers in johannesburg we represent the future of south 
africa 
more than 10000 activists rallied in port elizabeth despite a 
pamphlet distributed in abjoining black townships late friday 
suggesting marchers would be exposed to invisible radiation rays 
about 2000 blacks marched in bloemfontein it was one of the 
few mass protests ever in the conservative provincial capital of 
the orange free state 
an estimated 8000 people including hundreds of striking 
brewery workers marched in cape town and thousands more in the 
natal province cities of durban and pietermaritzburg 
eight is not enough free mandela read one banner in cape 
town 
in most cities the number of marchers was well below 
predictions by protest organizers antiapartheid leaders had said 
250000 would rally nationwide but preliminary reports indicated 
the actual figure would be less than 75000 
sisulu 77 a political strategist of mandelas african national 
congress and five jailed colleagues were flown friday from a cape 
town prison to their hometown of johannesburg according to airline 
personnel 
the men reportedly were being held at diepkloof prison near the 
huge black township of soweto where most of them live 
another prisoner raymond mhlaba was flown from cape town to 
his southern hometown port elizabeth the eighth prisoner 
80yearold oscar mpetha was at groote schuur hospital in cape 
town his hometown 
the decision by president fw de klerk to release the activists 
won praise in south africa and abroad de klerk who has been 
president since august says he wants to end racial discrimination 
and negotiate a new constitution to include the black majority in 
national government 
but black leaders say further concessions are needed before 
negotiations can begin they want an end to the state of emergency 
legalization of banned political groups and the remaining 
discriminatory laws to be scrapped 
the other soontobefreed prisoners who were tried along with 
sisulu and mandela at the rivonia treason trial in 1964 are ahmed 
kathrada 60 elias motsoaledi 65 andrew mlengi 63 and mhlaba 
69 
also to be freed are anc leaders mpetha and wilton mkwayi 67

all have been imprisoned for 25 years except mpetha who is 
nearing the end of a fiveyear term 
when they are released the seven anc members are expected to 
seek permission to travel to the guerrilla movements headquarters 
in lusaka zambia

east germany has agreed to allow almost 
1000 of its citizens who have taken refuge in poland to emigrate 
to the country of their choice poland said today 
the state news agency pap said east german deputy foreign 
minister harry ott met with polish officials and worked out the 
solution to the refugee problem 
the refugees including many families with small children had 
made their way to poland after more than 1400 east germans left 
for the west on oct 1 and oct 5 
the exodus from poland was part of a larger flood of east german 
refugees fleeing west through hungary and czechoslovakia the 
deluge of an estimated 50000 refugees since july has shaken east 
germanys hardline government 
diplomatic sources today put the number of refugees in the west 
german embassy or at shelters in poland at more than 950 
the earlier groups of refugees left by special east german 
trains sent to poland the pap announcement said that this time 
the refugees would be allowed to go to any country they choose 
after obtaining proper documents from the east german embassy 
it was unclear if the arrangement would apply to other east 
germans who make their way to poland despite east germanys 
attempts to limit travel to poland an average of about 120 
refugees a day have been arriving at the warsaw embassy 
although poland maintains it is trying to prevent illegal border 
crossings from east germany it does not check the documents of 
those who make it into poland polish officials have been working 
privately with the roman catholic church and the red cross to 
provide comfortable housing for the refugees 
the east german ambassador to poland visited the west german 
embassy just before the announcement on pap diplomatic sources 
said 
a group of about 40 east german refugees who apparently had just 
arrived were seen today carrying their belongings out of the west 
german embassy and boarding a chartered city bus to a temporary 
shelter in konstancin about 12 miles from warsaw 
everything is ok a west german red cross official told 
the group dont be afraid another refugee said to his 
countrymen as they walked to the bus 
inside the embassy another group of refugees appeared to be 
preparing to depart in another waiting bus 
it was not clear when the refugees would leave for the west 
west germanys zdf television network reported from warsaw that 
buses had been arranged but no firm plans had been announced 
east germany conceded friday that the exodus of more than 
100000 of its young and skilled citizens in the past year has cut 
significantly into its labor force and it called on those who have 
stayed behind to close the gap 
we certainly can do more indeed a lot more the state 
newspaper berliner zeitung urged the countrys workers 
in east berlin friday the state news agency adn announced that 
all but 11 of the estimated 1000 protesters who were jailed after 
prodemocracy demonstrations last week and on monday had been 
released 
also friday a highranking east german official dietmar 
keller spoke openly when asked about speculation of a possible 
resignation of hardline leader erich honecker 77 
as for erich honeckers resignation erich honecker must make 
that decision all alone keller the no 2 official in the 
culture ministry told a news conference in wolfenbuettel west 
germany 
keller added that any decision about honeckers political fate 
would require a meeting of the central committee 
i dont know if a meeting is planned or already called he 
said 
but if the majority of the central committee is of the opinion 
that major changes are necessary which is absolutely normal in the 
world and in politics then the required decision will be reached 
east german officials usually dismiss all questions about the 
possibility honecker could step down or be removed as 
provocative in contrast to kellers polite explanation of 
procedures needed to make a change at the top 
honeckers unyielding course has come under increasing criticism 
at home 
tens of thousands of east germans took to the streets in 
prodemocracy protests during and after the nations 40th 
anniversary celebrations last week the demonstrators insist they 
are staying in east germany to seek democratic and economic reforms

lebanese legislators wrangled today 
over a peace plan for their warplagued country and appeared unable 
to agree on ending syrias military presence in their country 
conference sources said the legislators meeting since sept 30 
narrowed their problems to the syrian issue after a 17member 
parliamentary task force approved an amended draft for political 
reforms during an allnight session 
michel sassin an orthodox christian deputy who is a member of 
the committee said the debates have reached an advanced stage in 
the interlebanese conciliation he would not elaborate 
the tentative approval of the first chapter of the arab 
leagueproposed lebanon peace plan drew cautious optimism from 
the participants the sources said noting that deputies had 
reneged on several previous accords after contacts with warlords 
and militia chieftains in beirut 
the lebanese civil war which has raged for 14 years has eroded 
government authority and allowed militia factions to take control 
of the streets consent of these factions is necessary for the 
success of any accord that may be reached in taif 
one source said they reach a consensus and then get a 
telephone call from beirut and we are back where we started 
the sources all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity 
explained that the second chapter of the peace plan which deals 
with the necessity of an israeli withdrawal from lebanon had been 
approved by all the participants without exception 
but the deputies remained divided over the third and fourth 
chapters of the plan lebanese sovereignty and relations with 
syria the plan was proposed by an arab committee comprised of 
saudi arabia morocco and algeria 
the christians are demanding written guarantees for a total 
syrian withdrawal from lebanon the moslems have approved a phased 
pullback from the beirut area to be completed in two years 
followed by an evacuation after the conclusion of a syrianlebanese 
peace pact 
a hardline christian deputy who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a political reforms accord would be ink on 
paper if no satisfactory solution is reached on the issue of 
sovereignty and a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
once the committee completes its debates the draft fourchapter 
plan would be submitted to a plenary session for approval 
parliament then will take the document back to beirut for 
ratification at a session to be held in the lebanese capital 
the reforms envisaged by the arab committee are designed to 
redistribute power betwen christians and moslems and prepare for 
the later stage of abolishing the sectarian system in force since 
independence from france in 1943 
christians then were considered the majority and given the upper 
hand in the government parliament army and judiciary moslems now 
are believed to comprise a majority of lebanons estimated 4 
million people

syria admitted today that an air force 
pilot who landed his sovietbuilt mig23 fighter jet in israel this 
week was a defector and branded him an abominable traitor and an 
israeli spy 
syria earlier had claimed that maj mohammed bassam adel was 
forced to land in northern israel on wednesday because of a 
technical problem today a military spokesman said the officer had 
misled syrian observation posts 
he maneuvered in a way to indicate that his plane was facing 
technical troubles the unnamed spokesman told the official 
syrian arab news agency sana 
then he changed course and headed toward the occupied 
territories to land in the israeli megiddo airport selling himself 
and his aircraft to the enemy the spokesman said 
on wednesday an official source said adels plane landed in 
israel with smoke pouring out of its engine damascus later 
requested the assistance of the international red cross in 
obtaining the repatriation of both the pilot and the plane 
adel 34 told a news conference in israel on friday that he 
defected in search of freedom and democracy and that he would not 
meet with any red cross representatives if their aim is to take him 
back to syria 
he was on a training mission near syrias southern border when 
he veered off and flew low toward northern israel at 700750 mph 
sana quoted the military spokesman as saying adels defection 
ended an espionage affair organized by the israeli intelligence 
service which had recruited this agent and used him to smuggle one 
of our air force jets and deliver it to the enemy 
this abominable traitor and israeli spy has stepped on all 
sacred national values when he sold his country and his people and 
spied for the enemy he betrayed the honor and confidence of the 
military the spokesman added

chancellor helmut kohl said his talks 
next month with polands solidarityled government will be a 
historic chance to mend fences with a world war ii adversary 
government spokesman hans klein said kohl will offer poland 
relief for its 39 billion foreign debt during his nov 914 visit 
kohls office also announced friday that the chancellor will 
visit hungary soon although no date has been set 
west germany has led efforts among european community and 
western creditors to help poland resolve its staggering economic 
problems the bonn government has also been outspoken in its 
support of democratic reforms instituted there and in hungary 
west germany is polands biggest trading partner and its biggest 
creditor holding about 20 percent of warsaws foreign debt 
we now have the historic chance because of the dramatic 
changes and improvements in poland for a new beginning in our 
relations 50 years after world war ii kohl told ard television 
we owe it to the younger generations to foster good 
neighborliness and friendship 
kohls chief foreign affairs adviser horst teltschik and 
teltschiks polish counterpart mieczyslaw pszon last week 
concluded a package of financial and political accords that resolve 
outstanding problems between the two countries government 
officials said 
klein said west germany will tie its financial assistance to 
specific projects he confirmed the two governments have discussed 
from 1 billion to 15 billion in aid 
west germany announced monday that it had agreed to reschedule 
13 billion in polish debt and an earlier agreement effectively 
wiped out about 523 million in loans to poland 
among the accords are programs to improve living conditions for 
ethnic germans in poland the language and culture of the ethnic 
minority have been discouraged in areas that were part of germany 
prior to world war ii 
west german officials concede privately that funds for 
germanlanguage schools and projects to increase production of 
consumer goods are aimed partly at stemming the flow of ethnic 
germans from poland more than 140000 ethnic germans emigrated 
from poland to west germany last year and that number has already 
been exceeded this year 
resolution of the economic and political issues cleared the way 
for kohls trip which initially was planned for the summer it was 
called off because of remaining differences between the two nations 
bonn had hoped to work out a reconciliation plan with poland 
before the 50th anniversary of the sept 1 1939 invasion of poland 
by nazi germany which set off world war ii 
negotiations toward the west germanpolish summit were put on 
hold during the spring talks between polands solidarity trade 
union and the communist party those negotiations polands freest 
elections in more than four decades which the opposition won by a 
landslide and the soviet blocs first cabinet not led by 
communists 
kohl will be the first western leader to pay an official visit 
to poland since tadeusz mazowiecki was named premier in august 
the talks had been frustrated by some prominent west german 
politicians who said german territory lost to poland after world 
war ii should be returned national tensions still flare over the 
40000 square miles of german territory deeded to poland after the 
defeat of nazi germany

municipal authorities in hangzhou are asking 
local residents to scatter the ashes of dead relatives in the river 
so they dont pile up at crematoriums an official report said 
saturday 
to emphasize the point the city funeral and internment 
administration will hold a ceremony next month to scatter 30 boxes 
of ashes into the qiantang river the peoples daily said 
cremation is required in most places in china because of a 
shortage of land for burial but with 7500 people dying each year 
in hangzhou an eastern city of fewer than 2 million even their 
ashes are becoming bulky the paper said 
most families leave them in urns at the city crematorium and 
visit to pay respects at the annual qing ming festival 
several late chinese leaders asked before death to have their 
ashes scattered on mountains and rivers and the paper quoted 
hangzhou vice mayor wang jizhong as saying that extending this to 
everyone would be good for the country 
authorities stressed the choice was up to the individual 
the paper did not mention any possible harm to rivers china has 
a serious water pollution problem with 80 percent of its rivers 
polluted by raw sewage and untreated industrial waste

a georgian activist saturday dismissed speculation 
that a car crash that killed a prominent georgian dissident was 
foul play and said it was an accident caused by a cow crossing the 
road 
merab kostava was riding with two other georgian

cast adrift by the gorbachev revolution many of 
western europes communist parties are groping for ideological 
stability knowing they can no longer count on moscow for guidance 
the upheaval in the soviet union the shift to democracy in 
hungary and poland and the flight of refugees from east germany 
have provoked responses from different parties ranging from 
congratulations to embarrassment 
with the bolshevik bogy being replaced in western minds by the 
benign image of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev some communists 
believe they can win new hearts and minds and reverse their 
electoral decline 
conversely others fear that communism is losing its identity 
and becoming a mere adjunct to westernstyle socialism 
what were witnessing is the breakup of the old communist 
culture said martin jacques editor of the british journal 
marxism today 
every communist party is in flux as a result jacques said 
in an interview some will survive metamorphose and those 
that dont theres a very good chance that the result will be 
oblivion 
communism in western europe has been in schism since the 1950s 
marked by periodic watersheds of what the austrian communist ernst 
fischer once denounced as panzerkommunismus or tank communism 
the crushing of the 1956 hungarian uprising the soviet invasion 
of czechoslovakia in 1968 the soviet entry into afghanistan in 
december 1979 each of these events forced communists to take a 
clear stand for or against the soviet line the result often was a 
party split 
but with gorbachevs openness to pluralism there simply is no 
longer a clear soviet line 
for doctrinaire parties the soviet union was like their god 
so what happens when the pope as it were turns on them gorbachev 
has clearly encouraged reforming forces within those parties and 
every hardline party has been thrown into crisis to some degree or 
other jacques said 
the larger communist parties have managed in varying measure 
to adapt to the hectic pace set by gorbachev those in italy 
france and spain can now claim they saw glasnost and 
perestroika coming and prepared the ground with eurocommunism 
a 1970s attempt to reconcile communist orthodoxy with life in a 
western parliamentary democracy 
for the west eurocommunism raised the specter of elected 
communists sitting at the cabinet tables of natoaligned countries 
but that has happened only in france from 1981 to 1984 under 
president francois mitterrand and for three months this year in 
greece 
the italian party the largest in the west actually supports 
italys membership in nato but has been barred from government 
coalitions since 1947 
its vote has declined from 344 percent in 1976 to 266 percent 
in 1987 and it is seeking a more youthful image even toying with 
the idea of dumping communist from its name the french and 
portuguese parties have also seen their support slump 
in spain the communists have been trying since 1986 to shed 
their hardleft image joining forces with other leftwing parties 
and no longer displaying the hammerandsickle flag at public 
meetings 
the portuguese party now accepts the western socialist concept 
of a mixed economy but in other areas it hews to doctrinaire 
marxismleninism 
last year it expelled reformist zita seabra for defending other 
dissidents right to criticize the party leadership 
west germanys tiny party is showing signs of strain over its 
resistance to reforms in may 1986 leader herbert mies won 952 
percent of the vote at the party convention last january he got 
only 718 percent and admitted that the 20 percent decline in 
membership during those three years resulted from the party often 
reacting to events too late and inappropriately 
the british party always marginal has been further weakened by 
a split into hardliners and the freethinking set whose views are 
expressed by jacques marxism today 
speaking for the hardliners john haylett agrees that the 
monolith is gone forever and that there are probably many old 
guard communists wandering around rudderless thinking my 
god everything that i believed in everything i thought highly of 
now turns out to have feet of clay 
but he insists communists can adapt saying individual 
communist parties no longer look toward one single view each party 
has to assess what it sees as the realities of a situation and make 
a judgment 
is that good or bad haylett believes it can broaden the 
communists voter appeal because it is harder for communisms foes 
to play on the russian bear the communist bogy 
on the other hand some worry that if communism is being spurned 
by poles and hungarians it is less likely to appeal to western 
voters 
the clashing opinions are reflected in responses to what is 
happening in eastern europe 
the reformist parties have welcomed the democratic trend in 
poland and hungary and bitterly criticized the east german 
leadership 
you cannot put your head in the sand said the swedish 
partys vice president gudrun schyman dutch communist party 
leader ina brouwer said centrally organized socialism with a 
oneparty system is bankrupt that much is clear from events in 
eastern europe 
the traditionalists are more inclined to defend the old order 
they insist hungary has not really dumped communism just 
streamlined it that polands problems stem not just from the 
shortcomings of communist centralization but also from polands 
financial debt to the capitalist powers that the flight of 
thousands of east germans is a conspiracy by west germany using the 
lure of passports jobs and homes 
how would you feel if the government in france considered that 
the citizens of britain were actually the citizens of france and 
could be given french passports just for the asking you would 
regard it as a hostile act and might consider that it indicates a 
desire to occupy a part of britain said tony chater editor of 
the morning star britains communist daily

the average japanese company employee earned 
27000 last year but the typical male earned more than twice as 
much as his female counterpart according to a government study 
reported saturday 
the average annual income for japans 38 million company 
employees including bonuses was up by 915 or 35 percent from 
the previous year the national tax agency said

15800 less than half the average mans 33100 the figures 
include parttime employees who worked for the entire 12month 
period 
bonuses given twice a year at most japanese companies 
increased by 65 percent the largest rise since 1979 when the 
increase was 86 percent the larger bonuses contributed greatly to 
last years income increase the nationally circulated newspaper 
mainichi shimbun quoted the agency as saying 
the average net disposable income after adjustment for inflation 
grew by 29 percent from a year earlier helped mainly by the 
larger bonuses and an income tax cut the agency said 
about 34 million or 90 percent of the company employees paid 
income tax last year the report said it said the average worker 
paid about 1690 
in comparison the average selfemployed person other than 
doctors and lawyers paid only 1440 in taxes while farmers paid 
an average of 1010

sen dennis deconcini dariz we wanted to meet with you 
because we have determined that potential actions of yours could 
injure a constituent they lincoln have two major 
disagreements with you first with regard to direct investment 
where the sampl becomes a partner in a real estate venture second 
on your reappraisal theyre suing against your direct investment 
regulation we suggest that the lawsuit be accelerated and that 
you grant them forbearance while the suit is pending i know 
something about the appraisal values of the federal home loan bank 
board they appear to be grossly unfair lincoln is prepared to 
reach a compromise value with you 
sen alan cranston dcalif arriving im sorry i cant join 
you but i have to be on the floor to deal with the bill i just 
want to say that i share the concerns of the other senators on this 
subject cranston leaves 
sen john mccain rariz one of our jobs as elected officials 
is to help constituents in a proper fashion acc is a big employer 
and important to the local economy i wouldnt want any special 
favors for them i dont want any part of our conversation to 
be improper id like to mention the appraisal issue it seems 
to me theres a problem arizona is the second fastest growing 
state land values are skyrocketing that has to be taken account 
of in appraisals 
sen john glenn dohio even the accounting firm says 
youve taken an unusually adversary view toward lincoln to be 
blunt you should charge them or get off their backs if things are 
bad there get to them 
james cirona president of the federal home loan bank of san 
francisco this meeting is very unusual to discuss a particular 
company 
deconcini its very unusual for us to have a company that could 
be put out of business by its regulators 
richard sanchez supervisory agent lincoln had underwriting 
problems with all of their investments the examiners looked at 
52 real estate loans that lincoln had made since the 1984 exam 
there were no credit reports on the borrowers in all 52 of the loan 
files 
cirona these underwriting practices violate our regulatory 
guidelines 
black they are also an unsafe and unsound practice 
sen donald riegle dmich wheres the smoking gun where are 
the losses 
deconcini whats wrong with this if theyre willing to clean up 
their act 
cirona this is a ticking time bomb 
riegle these people saved a failing thrift acc is reputed to 
be highly competent 
black lincoln was not a failing thrift before acc acquired it 
it met its net worth requirement it had returned to profitability 
before it was acquired 
michael patriarca director of agency functions im relatively 
new to the savings and loan industry but ive never seen any bank 
or sampl thats anything like this this isnt even close you can 
ask any banker you know about these practices they violate the law 
and regulations and common sense 
glenn what violates the law 
patriarca their direct investments violate the regulation then 
theres the file stuffing they took undated documents purporting 
to show underwriting efforts and put them into the files sometimes 
more than a year after 
glenn have you done anything about these violations of law 
patriarca were sending a criminal referral to the department 
of justice not maybe were sending one this is an 
extraordinarily serious matter 
deconcini the criminality surprises me were not interested in 
discussing those issues our premise was that we had a viable 
institution concerned that it was being overregulated

congress is pinning this years hopes of 
deficit reduction on a gimmickfilled package that speeds up 
collections and puts off payments while raising some user fees and 
specialized taxes 
that package will not be in put in place quickly enough to avoid 
acrosstheboard spending cuts in many spending programs on monday 
but those arbitrary cuts can be rescinded once congress agrees on a 
plan to bring the 1990 deficit below 110 billion 
the senate approved its plan friday night by an 877 vote after 
stripping away hundreds of spending increases and targeted tax 
cuts the house plan was passed oct 5 
president bush severely limited deficitreduction options when 
he rejected any general tax increase congress restricted itself by 
agreeing there would be no cuts in social security benefits 
the lawmakers had a chance to make significant cuts when they 
considered the 13 separate appropriations bills that pay for most 
government activities including defense the courts and congress 
but they fell short their actions on appropriations will produce 
little or no deficit savings they could deepen the deficit by 6 
billion or so 
that left congress to choose from minor tax increases and 
reductions in spending that is not subject to annual 
appropriations such as medicare farm price supports and welfare 
the lawmakers ended up with a combination of onetime savings 
acceleration of tax collections higher user fees and some tax 
increases that will fall mainly on corporations 
some examples of the shortterm savings 
the plan passed by the house would delay for 16 days payment of 
all claims from doctors and hospitals for treating medicare 
patients present law has a 14day wait the extra two days would 
cut the 1990 deficit by 470 million 
the senate bill would cut the deficit by 111 million by 
requiring that gasoline taxes be collected and handed over to the 
treasury at an earlier stage in the distributon process 
to generate an extra 800 million for deficit reduction in 1990 
the senate bill would give large employers only one day to turn 
over taxes they have withheld from workers paychecks they now 
generally have three days 
then there is the capitalgains tax cut the hottest issue in 
congress democrats were able to keep the issue off the senate 
bill but the house bowed to bushs urging and approved a cut it 
would produce 29 billion in budget saving in 1990 most of which 
would amount to borrowing from capitalgains revenues that 
otherwise would be expected in future years 
both houses voted to show a 177billion deficit cut simply by 
removing the postal service along with its own deficit from the 
federal budget both claim another 568 million deficit reduction 
by counting savings caused by repeal earlier this year of certain 
tax benefits for savings and loan associations 
the house agreed to require federal employees who retire in 1990 
to wait an extra year for their lumpsum retirement annuity the 
deficit would drop by 700 million 
the senate plan would raise 50 million by allowing boat owners 
to buy a decal entitling them to certain coast guard services 
rental of airport slots at laguardia and kennedy airports in new 
york ohare in chicago and national in washington would raise 239 
million 
the senate voted to triple the maximum penalty that can be 
imposed by the mine safety and health administration and to raise 
five times those imposed by the occupational health and safety 
administration cutting the deficit by 30 million and 65 million 
respectively 
denying that medical residents are students for purposes of 
student loan deferments would raise 10 million under the senate 
bill 
there are some real tax increases in one or both bills for 
example both would repeal a special benefit for banks that lend to 
employees who are buying stock in their employers corporation 
both would deny refunds of pastyear taxes to companies claiming 
large interest deductions from loans used in corporatetakeover 
efforts 
a handful of companies that manufacture chemicals deemed to 
deplete the earths ozone layer would be hit with a new tax a 
scheduled decline in the 8 percent airline ticket tax would be 
delayed a year to 1991 in the house bill and to next oct 1 in 
the senate bill 
the proposed tax increase with an impact on the greatest number 
of americans extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone service 
past a scheduled dec 31 1990 expiration was stripped from the 
senate bill the house voted to make the tax permanent

after more than two months of solo flying 
accompanied by such perils as guerrilla missiles hurricane hugo 
and equipment breakdowns gaby kennard landed safely and said 
saturday it will be all downhill from here 
the 45yearold australian pilot is nearing the end of a 
roundtheworld trip retracing the 1937 flight of american aviator 
amelia earhart who vanished in the south pacific on the final leg 
of a recordsetting global journey 
mrs kennard has flown 27000 miles since she left sydney on 
aug 2 she has another 6000 miles to go on a route that will take 
her to pakistan india and thailand before heading home 
she landed in bahrain on friday the 13th 
getting to bahrain was like a big hurdle she said saturday 
in an interview i feel like its all downhill from here 
mrs kennard was briefly feared missing after she left cairo and 
did not show up as expected in jiddah saudi arabia it turned out 
she had stopped in luxor egypt before flying directly across the 
saudi desert to bahrain 
mrs kennard is piloting a singleengine piper saratoga 
financed by a mortgage on her house in sydney and other loans just 
when funds were running low she got a boost from a commercial 
sponsor in hawaii 
mrs kennard said she dreamed of flying since childhood but the 
inspiration for the global trip came when she learned about 
earhart whose fate remains a mystery after 52 years 
a mother of two she has been a pilot for 10 years and is a 
member of the ninetynines an international organization of 
women pilots founded by earhart 
in retracing earharts flight mrs kennard flew from new guinea 
to majuro there three local citizens told her their fathers and 
other relatives claimed to have seen earhart and her navigator 
fred noonan after they made an emergency landing on killi atoll 
and were taken prisoner july 2 1937 by the japanese who then 
controlled the marshall islands 
after talking to those people im convinced that amelia was 
taken prisoner by the japanese and died in captivity she said 
the marshall islanders simply havent any reason to lie 
mrs kennard said her own trip has been so fraught with delays 
and adventure that she sometimes feels as if amelia is sitting on 
my shoulder amelia and a lot of other people 
she said the most frightening times have been night flights over 
oceans on the longest such leg the 2000 miles from hawaii to 
california a faulty fuel switch caused her engine to cut 
repeatedly 
she fled puerto rico in haste to escape hurricane hugo one of 
the most devastating storms of recent years 
hugo and i passed each other going in opposite directions 
about 250 miles apart i could see the clouds she said if id 
stayed it would have destroyed the plane 
on an 11hour night hop from natal brazil to dakar senegal 
she steered through four hours of violent thunderstorms using 
lightning flashes as her guide when i saw one i turned the 
other way 
on the way from dakar to morocco she was told to fly 20 miles 
offshore to avoid guerrillas who have used antiaircraft missiles 
to shoot down at least two agricultural aircraft in recent months 
but mrs kennard said she changed her mind when she looked down 
from 1500 feet and saw a giant shark at least a 20footer 
below 
i thought oh no ill take my chances with the guerrillas 
anyway this is not my day to get shot down

some of the oldest and sickest of americas 
elderly are among those who will be hardest hit if congress scraps 
or scales back medicare coverage of catastrophic health care costs 
advocates for the elderly say 
many of these frail aging americans are in an economic tier of 
the elderly population that is too poor to buy adequate private 
supplementary health insurance but not poor enough to qualify for 
medicaid analysts say 
congress is moving to repeal or cut back the yearold medicare 
catastrophic coverage act in response to complaints from 
higherincome seniors who felt they already had adequate private 
coverage and would have paid too much of the programs costs 
through an income tax surcharge 
but defenders of the program maintain cutbacks would assuage an 
affluent and vocal minority of senior citizens at the expense of 
millions of lowerincome americans vulnerable to financial ruin 
from high medical bills 
tricia smith of the american association of retired persons 
describes those most vulnerable to the loss of catastrophiccare 
benefits as poor frail old women 
some betteroff older americans also may feel a pinch if 
congress rolls back the medicare catastrophic coverage experts say 
many retirees for example will see sizable increases in their 
costs for private medigap insurance as companies expand 
policies to include expenses not covered by medicare and raise 
prices to keep up with the high inflation rate in health care 
in addition many private policies wont pick up prescription 
drug costs and certain other benefits that are at risk of repeal 
there will be a pure loss to people who have high drug 
expenses which are a substantial portion of the elderly said 
joshua m wiener health policy specialist at the brookings 
institution a liberal think tank 
states too are likely to see their health costs rise since 
congress is expected to preserve portions of the catastrophic 
package that boost state medicaid spending while it repeals 
provisions that pared other medicaid expenses 
the governments catastrophic coverage package was designed to 
provide senior citizens with protection against impoverishment from 
high doctor hospital and drug bills it also offered new coverage 
of other miscellaneous health care costs such as respite care and 
mammograms 
housesenate bargaining over the future of the program is likely 
to begin this week the house has voted to repeal almost the entire 
program and the senate to preserve the hospitalization protections 
and some smaller benefits while scrapping the new coverage for drug 
and doctor fees 
edmund haislmaier health policy analyst at the conservative 
heritage foundation said that if the program is repealed youre 
going to have about 10 percent of the population near the poverty 
level who will be at risk of being pushed down into poverty by the 
risk of some serious illness 
haislmaier said the senatepassed plan is a workable compromise 
that retains the most crucial benefits expanded hospitalization 
coverage and new medicaid help for the poorest of the elderly 
advocates for the elderly meanwhile see each of the benefits 
in the catastrophic package as important in its own right 
for example the prescription drug benefit which would be 
phased in over several years if it is preserved would benefit 6 
million people a year many of whom spend more than 2000 a year 
on medications 
the mammogram benefit in 1990 offering payment for routine 
testing every other year is expected to save 4000 lives a year if 
it survives 
the respite care benefit which in 1990 would pay for limited 
services by a home health aide would offer relief to family and 
friends burdened with the responsibility of daily care for an aged 
loved one 
overall the winners under a repeal or rollback of benefits are 
retirees who can return to employersponsored health programs or 
medigap plans that provide good coverage at less cost than the 
government program wiener said 
the governments catastrophic plan was a terrible deal 
financially for upperincome seniors but for the majority of the 
nations 33 million medicare recipients the value of benefits 
would have substantially exceeded what they would have paid he 
said 
an estimated 70 percent of elderly americans buy private 
supplementary coverage of health insurance costs not covered by 
medicare and an additional 10 percent qualify for medicaid that 
leaves about 20 percent who depend on medicare and must absorb any 
uncovered costs out of their own pockets 
these people are often among the older and sicker in the 
elderly population said diane rowland assistant professor of 
health policy at johns hopkins university 
sixteen percent of the elderly have income between 100 percent 
and 150 percent of the poverty line among that nearpoor 
group 27 percent have no health coverage other than medicare and 
for the 65 percent who do buy private supplements their premiums 
are likely to be as much of a financial catastrophe as medical 
expenses rowland said the other 8 percent are covered by 
medicaid for which eligibility levels vary from state to state 
james firman president of the united seniors health 
cooperative said that for those who do buy medigap coverage 
premiums are likely to rise 30 percent to 40 percent next year 
we are also very concerned that theres going to be a new wave 
of abuses in the marketing and sale of medigap policies firman 
said theres going to be a great deal of fear and confusion on 
the part of older people 
donald white a spokesman for the health insurance association 
of america which represents 350 of the nations insurance 
companies said that while premiums are likely to rise there 
will not be any gaps in coverage and there is not going to be chaos 
in the insurance market

in one of the dozens of scrapbooks kept by bette 
davis a picture portrays the young actress as the model of 
gentility wearing a long white dress holding a white parasol 
next to the photo is scrawled for publicity what else 
the actress who died this month at age 81 chronicled her 
stardom with hundreds of articles photos annotated scripts 
letters and mementos the collection housed at boston university 
reveals not only her career but her irreverent attitude toward 
hollywood glamour 
the scrapbooks are just like her mind she was meticulous 
said howard gotlieb who as curator of the university librarys 
special collections persuaded davis to donate the memorabilia more 
than 15 years ago 
the collection contains more than 100000 items that range from 
davis fourthgrade report card her best marks were in reading 
and spelling to the transcript of her appearance on televisions 
this is your life 
there are photos of davis with stars such as clark gable 
spencer tracy and gary cooper and copies of speeches she gave in 
support of franklin d roosevelt and the governments effort to 
sell war bonds during world war ii 
one box contains a mirror that belonged to the legendary french 
actress sarah bernhardt it later became a gift to davis from the 
government of france 
another item in the collection is a victorianstyle factory time 
clock that davis detested as a teenager when she worked at a 
factory in lowell where she was born the timekeeping device 
irked her so much that she tracked it down 60 years later and 
donated it to the archive 
davis also kept a story about her life written by her mother 
ruth favor davis 
bette davis christianed ruth elizabeth davis was born on 
april 5th 1908 nothing happened of importance to herald her 
arrival the story begins 
but in a later passage the elder davis describes how her 
daughter once was playing santa claus in school and her costume 
caught fire from candles on a christmas tree her face was burned 
and she had no eyebrows left 
she told me later that for the next few moments she kept her 
eyes closed saying to herself ill make them think im blind 
her mother wrote even then she was reaching for the limelight 
even when she was in pain and even at the expense of the people who 
loved her 
it was when davis reached the limelight of hollywood that her 
career blossomed and likewise her memorabilia starts to burst from 
the scrapbooks with articles filling every available inch on many 
pages and some clippings overlapping 
one article discussing the cost of hosiery in hollywood gained 
entry into davis collection because it included a picture of her 
legs and nothing else 
davis kept clips from her 1936 trip to great britain after she 
had become embroiled in a contract dispute with warner bros the 
articles range from those with big headlines like famous film 
star in blackpool to a tiny onesentence item saying she had 
arrived in liverpool 
gotlieb who knew davis for 26 years and has a portrait of her 
in his office that was used in jezebel said the actress who 
won an academy award for that film never tried to fake modesty 
she knew she was extremely good he said 
davis kept hundreds of congratulatory telegrams even one in 
1937 from a group in new york called associated cinema fans of 
westchester inc the telegram reads delighted to inform you we 
have unanimously voted you ideal choice scarlett ohara 
davis once told an interviewer she had the opportunity to play 
the muchsoughtafter lead role in gone with the wind but 
unknowingly gave up the chance amid her dispute with warner bros 
davis gained fame with dozens of other movies and she kept 
leatherbound scripts that have her name printed in gold 
on the scripts are her notations for example in one of her 
more famous roles as a flamboyant but fading broadway star in all 
about eve davis scribbled several reminders to have a drink and 
of course light a cigarette 
the lighted cigarette was one of her trademarks it appears not 
only in davis script annotations but also in many of her photos 
one picture shows her standing on a stone patio cigarette in 
mouth striking a match 
a favorite photograph she wrote

the bush administration looking for hopeful 
signs after the bungled coup attempt in panama is encouraged by 
evidence of the growing repudiation in latin america of gen manuel 
antonio noriegas rule 
and administration officials are hoping to accelerate the 
process at two major international parlays over the next month and 
in other diplomatic encounters as well 
at his news conference friday president bush said he was 
delighted by signs that noriega has so little support elsewhere in 
the hemisphere 
panamas membership in an eightcountry hemispheric consultative 
body has been suspended and when the seven active members met this 
past week in peru noriegas government was roundly criticized 
still there appears to be litte sentiment in the hemisphere for 
us military action against noriega in contrast to many members 
of congress no hemispheric leader criticized bush for not 
providing panamas rebel leaders with more military support on the 
day of the coup attempt 
noriega seems to believe that diplomatic isolation counts for 
little as long as he retains the support of panamas defense 
forces but us officials say the countrys outcast role will 
further erode his already questionable support within the military 
establishment 
the officials say all but two democratic countries in the 
hemisphere mexico and ecuador have withdrawn their ambassadors 
from panama city 
those two embassies barely have contact with the panamanian 
government one official said friday asking not to be identified 
he said the most active embassies in panama city appear to be 
those of cuba nicaragua and libya 
the panama question is likely to be a major topic this week when 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez comes to washington for 
talks with bush 
saying the time has come for noriega to retire gonzalez last 
week called for new elections followed by the appointment of a new 
military commander by the elected president 
as an inducement for noriega to go along with gonzalezs plan 
he would be allowed to retire in panama thus evading possible 
extradition to the united states where he faces drug smuggling 
charges so long as he remains in panama he cannot be extradited 
the administration will give gonzalez a hearing on his plan and 
also hopes to press its case against noriega at a summit meeting of 
hemispheric democratic heads of government set for oct 2728 in 
costa rica 
bush and about 17 other heads of government are planning to 
attend but administration officials say it would be a mistake to 
raise expectations that the summit will lead to dramatic action 
against noriega 
among spanish speaking countries the only presidents not 
invited are from cuba chile and panama none of which has an 
elected government 
yet another opportunity for the administration to pressure 
noriega will occur in midnovember when foreign ministers of the 
31nation organization of american states meet in washington 
the oas held four special sessions on panama between may and 
august but a team of oas mediators was unable to fulfill its 
mandate of achieving a democratic transfer of power in panama 
the mediation effort was suspended several weeks ago but a 
revival of that initiative remains an option 
bush has not ruled out military force against noriega 
suggesting friday he would be willing to consider such a move so 
long as it could be done with prudence 
but for the short term at least the administration appears 
resigned to relying on other ways of bringing down the panamanian 
leader all tedious and undramatic but relatively uncontroversial 
besides diplomatic pressure the administration has had in place 
for some time a series of economic sanctions against panama 
officials say a tightening of these measures has been under 
consideration since well before the failed coup attempt of oct 3 
one possibility is the withholding from the panamanian 
government of about 15 million in taxes us government agencies 
pay monthly on behalf of their panamanian employees

bill nelson who naral said has a record of opposing abortion 
rights 
tom miller iowas democratic attorney general and candidate 
for governor in 1990 miller is described as a staunch 
antiabortion advocate who faces several prochoice opponents in 
the democratic primary 
william oneill democratic governor of connecticut who faces 
several likely opponents 
kurt pringle republican state representative in california 
who won his first term narrowly in 1988 he is from orange county 
naral said californias legislative elections would be a special 
target because antiabortion forces have a narrow majority in the 
state assembly 
denny smith republican congressman from oregon who won 
narrowly in 1988 
tom tauke republican congressman from iowa who is an 
antiabortion candidate for the senate in 1990 opposing democratic 
sen tom harkins bid for a second term 
the group is also involved in the 1989 races for governor in new 
jersey and virginia and on thursday began airing ads on virginia 
television stations attacking antiabortion republican candidate 
marshall coleman it was also running ads in more than a dozen 
sunday newspapers 
michelman said the group plans to work in 1990 party primary 
campaigns in an effort to defeat antiabortion candidates 
in iowa the group plans to run an independent expenditure 
campaign against miller in florida michelman said the group would 
reassess its involvement in the governors race if nelson becomes 
the democratic nominee and he does not embrace a prochoice 
position 
dinkins paid tribute to the women and men of the florida state 
legislature and the us house of representatives for their actions 
to protect reproductive choice for all of americas women 
while the florida legislature rebuffed martinez the house voted 
216206 to broaden the circumstances under which poor women may 
obtain a federally financed abortion now allowed only if the 
womans life is in danger the new measure would permit 
taxpayerpaid abortions in cases of rape and incest as well 
dinkins also took note of the supreme courts ruling earlier 
this year in a missouri case in which the high court gave the 
states broader authority to regulate abortions 
with the webster decision we learned that the supreme court 
can be packed and rights once recognized must constantly be 
renewed and defended in the political arena dinkins said 
the nations highest court is sending the struggle for 
reproductive rights back to the grassroots to the governors 
mansions state legislatures city halls neighborhoods precincts 
and streets of every city town and village in the nation he 
said

soviet legislators tasting real power for the 
first time in the history of the communist state are trooping to 
capitol hill looking for ways to make the supreme soviet operate 
more like the us congress 
ive asked for a copy of this law and im going to have it 
translated into russian and take it home for a model a visibly 
moved ilya zaslavsky told reporters in a room just off the senate 
floor during the rollcall vote passing legislation on civil rights 
for the handicapped 
zaslavsky 29 who lost both legs due to medical malpractice in 
his childhood was the guest of senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas whose right arm was crippled during world war ii 
after a sweeping victory last march in the voting district of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev zaslavsky has emerged as a 
champion of the handicapped and one of the most articulate 
reformers in the soviet parliament 
five soviet legislators who made the pilgrimage to capitol hill 
over the past month told the associated press they were impressed 
by the power of congressional committees and size of congressional 
staffs 
im very jealous said volodymyr yavorivsky a legislator 
from the soviet ukraine who visited the capitol on tuesday 
a soviet lawmaker is lucky to have a staff of two compared with 
14 for a member of the us house and 34 for the average senator 
yavorivsky who was raised with a hatred of capitalist 
society said that since arriving in the united states last week 
he has been deeply impressed by american tolerance for divergent 
views 
and americans traveling to the soviet union recently have been 
astounded by newfound tolerance there 
two us congressional delegations traveled to moscow this 
summer spreading the gospel of american democracy and several 
members found soviet parliamentarians eager to receive copies of 
us laws rep dave dreier rcal left moscow impressed with 
russian sincerity in studying congress 
this is not the kgb said dreier these are people who 
want information on the way congress does business 
the soviet parliament known as the supreme soviet has been 
used to secondclass status said dreier they do not yet know 
the power they have but they are eager to learn 
in the past the supreme soviet rubber stamped decisions made by 
the ruling communist party politburo 
since semifree elections last march soviet lawmakers have 
challenged the authority of the government turning down a dozen 
cabinet nominees grilling the heads of the military and secret 
police and last week rejecting as unconstitutional a proposal by 
gorbachev to ban strikes for 15 months 
i have come to the united states with newly opened eyes 
said yavorivsky for 70 years the authorities have pounded into 
the ukraine a hatred of capitalist society which we were told was 
rotting away 
we were wondering when we would smell the stench of rot he 
said instead we smell sausage ham and meat commodities that 
have all but disappeared from stores throughout the soviet union 
in his home district of kiev still crowded with refugees from 
the 1986 chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster yavorivsky has turned 
part of his threeroom apartment into an office and enlisted his 
wife and daughter as helpers without pay to work on constituent 
problems 
like other soviet lawmakers yavorivsky is a man with a mission 
working on a parliamentary committee to block pollution in the 
ukraine the second largest of the 15 soviet republics 
yavorivsky belongs to the 2250member congress of peoples 
deputies that was elected in march and selected from its ranks the 
542member supreme soviet the sitting legislature 
konstantin d lubenchenko a moscow state university law 
professor elected to the supreme soviet said his mission is among 
the first generation of soviet congressmen who are attempting 
to build a legalbased government a government based on the rule 
of law 
you should think about us as bricklayers who are building a 
house without having a good blueprint in order to construct a 
blueprint for this house we have come to the united states to 
study said lubenchenko 
soviet lawmakers he said are especially interested in learning 
how congress asserts control over the executive organ of power 
before gorbachevs reforms the real power lay in the hands of 
party apparatchiks said lubenchenko 
for lubenchenko chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional 
legislation and reform one of the most startling discoveries was 
the size of congressional staffs 15000 
staff size involves more than prestige in an age where 
information can equal power and in a system where the government 
has withheld key facts 
in theory each of the 542 soviet deputies is entitled to 300 
rubles 480 a month for staff but that barely covers the salary 
of a secretary plus an assistant who is expert in the lawmakers 
area of speciality said lubenchenko 
soviet deputies have been promised office space in moscow he 
said but now they must settle for a room in the hotel moskva near 
the kremlin 
we have so little technical support that i had to get my son 
to try to rig a computer to help us out lubenchenko said 
laughing his payment isnt bad though ill give him a few 
pairs of bluejeans from this trip

satellitegathered data on weather crops and 
environmental damage will be crucial in avoiding world famine in 
the 21st century an ohio congressman said saturday in urging 
support for us earthobservation programs 
rep tony hall dohio said satellites are basic tools for 
humanity in the search for solutions to hunger but according to 
a report he released on existing and future remote sensing 
capacities of earth satellites funding for the primary us 
satellite program landsat is uncertain at best 
hall said the study satellite technology and world food 
security provides clear evidence that any loss of our 
satellite capability will directly affect our ability to avert 
famine 
this report makes clear the crucial role of the us satellite 
landsat in monitoring food production the food security community 
has not spoken loudly enough in support of landsat as congress 
debated its precarious future 
hall who is chairman of the house select committee on hunger 
issued the congressional research service study in conjunction with 
world food day which takes place monday the study had been 
requested by rep mickey leland dtexas the committees former 
chairman who died in a plane crash in africa 
the study said the worlds population could nearly triple to 14 
billion in the next century and with satellites playing a 
frontline role in helping predict weather crop failure and 
eventual famine the united states must decide whether it will 
continue building and operating satellites such as landsat or rely 
more heavily on foreign data the report said 
to monitor agricultural and environmental conditions the united 
states primarily uses data from civilian polar orbiting satellites 
and from the landsat program which has two aging satellites in 
orbit and a replacement under construction 
united nations world food groups use data from us european 
space agency french japanese and the soviet satellites 
the national aeronautics and space administration plans a 
mission to planet earth program in the 1990s that will use 
satellites to study the earths natural systems but the plan could 
cost 15 billion to 30 billion over a 20year period and no 
budget is yet available the report said 
hall said the nasa plan must also include activities that will 
increase understanding of earths capacity to produce sufficient 
food 
the government in 1985 turned over to a private company eosat 
operation of landsat 4 and 5 eosat also received a 250 million 
subsidy and was to build two more satellites 
but congress and the white house debated funding for the 
following three years and the commerce department announced earlier 
it had no money to operate the satellites 
the satellites were given a reprieve in june when president bush 
said he would approve new funds for landsats 4 5 and 6 however 
the source of that funding is unclear as congress works on a 
deficitreduction package for fiscal 1989 
a july 1991 launch is planned for landsat 6 but landsats 4 and 
5 which have been operating beyond their expected lifetimes could 
cease operation before that time the report said

the communist party daily on 
saturday served notice that the government will not allow 
demonstrations by independent groups to mark the anniversary of the 
founding of czechoslovakia on oct 28 
the newspaper rude pravo said several czechoslovak dissident 
groups hoped to demonstrate that day to mark 71 years of 
czechoslovak independence 
last year on the anniversary riot police using water cannons 
and tear gas dispersed a crowd of about 5000 demanding more 
freedom at home 
several illegal groups want to misuse the oncoming state 
anniversary for confrontation with our state power rude pravo 
said 
nobody at home or abroad can expect us to vacate our 
positions for antisocialist forces and let the party lose its 
influence on the course of events it added 
in a separate article the newspaper blasted west german 
chancellor helmut kohl for a speech oct 10 at the opening of the 
book fair in frankfurt in which he said the winds of freedom will 
blow one day in czechoslovakia 
poland has in a very encouraging way stepped forward on a 
path of bigger freedom and more human rights and hungary is about 
to follow kohl said referring to recent democratic reforms in 
those soviet bloc nations 
thats why it is more than a mere dream that one day even in 
czechoslovakia and elsewhere the wind of freedom will blow kohl 
said he also urged czechoslovak authorities to grant dissident 
vaclav havel an exit visa so he could come to the fair to receive 
its top prize 
havel has not received permission to travel to frankfurt 
its hard to believe that at a time when eastwest relations 
are improving bonn comes with a strange concept of building a 
common european home rude pravo said accusing kohl of acting 
as a teacher of nations and interfering in czechoslovakias 
internal affairs 
although it enjoys one of the highest standards of living among 
the seven warsaw pact nations czechoslovakia has taken one of the 
hardest lines against dissent and has been reluctant to emulate 
political and economic reforms under way in the soviet bloc

hundreds of workers fled oil rigs in the gulf 
of mexico as tropical storm jerry inched toward the coasts of texas 
and louisiana 
a hurricane watch was issued this morning for the coast from 
port arthur texas to the mouth of the mississippi river with 
landfall somewhere along that area forecast for sunday at the 
earliest 
the storm weakened slightly this morning and also was found to 
be farther away from land than first thought and moving more 
slowly said forecasters at the national hurricane center in coral 
gables fla 
jerry developed rapidly from a tropical depression off the 
mexican coast and by early today had maximum sustained winds of 70 
mph by late morning though the winds had eased to 65 mph 
forecasters said conditions were not favorable for a major 
increase in storm strength but noted that even a relatively slight 
increase could bring the storm up to hurricane strength defined as 
74 mph or more 
evacuations from the oil rigs began early friday soon after 
jerry reached tropical storm strength in the southwestern gulf 
stirring up rough seas officials said more than 4000 workers 
would be brought to shore if the rigs were all shut down 
we started as soon as it became a tropical storm shell oil 
spokeswoman wendy jacobs said everyone knows you dont take any 
chances with these 
at noon edt today jerrys center was near 249 north latitude 
and 931 west longitude about 400 miles south southwest of new 
orleans the storm was moving north at 6 mph more slowly than 
forecasters thought earlier in the day 
the systems rough seas could coincide with unusually high tides 
expected all week because of an unusual alignment of the earth sun 
and moon 
tides through friday were expected to peak at their highest 
levels in a decade clark said perhaps a foot above their usual 
highs in the gulf 
jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since hurricane 
hugo ravaged the caribbean and coastal south carolina last month 
the storm which killed 33 in the caribbean and 29 on the mainland 
united states hit charleston sc late sept 21 
storm preparations were under way along the gulf coast 
on grand island la in the gulf south of new orleans 
officials readied evacuation plans for 2000 residents 
we just have to play it hourbyhour and see what happens but 
when theres a storm in the gulf it kind of raises everybodys 
hackles a bit said pete picou civil defense director of cameron 
parish on the southwestern louisiana coast down here you cant 
ever take them for granted

republican rep john rowland did an aboutface 
on the abortion issue a week before his planned announcement as a 
candidate for connecticut governor and offered i dont know 
when asked why he changed positions 
democrat rep wg hefner also shifted and voted to soften the 
ban on medicaidfinanced abortions he reasoned that he previously 
had been a target of abortion foes in his north carolina district 
but that the political climate was starting to change 
other congressmen gave other reasons their wives had pressured 
them or they really meant to vote this way last time 
but by any analysis the changes in position by 27 members of 
congress on the issue of taxfinanced abortions reflect a change in 
the political dynamics of abortion 
republican rep henry hyde whose name has been linked with the 
medicaid abortion restrictions known as the hyde amendment for 
a decade put his finger on what had happened 
theyre perceiving their constituencies as prochoice he 
said 
last weeks events in congress in floridas legislature and in 
the states holding elections this year showed that the new 
politics of abortion could have broadening implications 
republican strategists are clearly concerned about polls 
suggesting voters are increasingly inclined to support continuing 
legal abortions and to oppose candidates who want to limit those 
rights the republican party since ronald reagans nomination in 
1980 has had a strongly antiabortion platform 
this causes republicans in general nervousness said one 
national republican strategist abortion as an issue 
definitely has changed for candidates at the governor and state 
legislature level citing the sensitivity of the issue the 
strategist spoke only on condition of anonymity 
while the depth of change remains subject to debate all sides 
called it a reaction to the supreme courts ruling last summer in 
the webster case by giving states broader authority to regulate 
abortions the court made abortion and the prospect that abortion 
rights could be taken away a more relevant issue in the states 
and mobilized prochoice groups 
clearly the prochoice movement has outmaneuvered the prolife 
movement since webster said eddie mahe a republican political 
consultant 
emboldened by their successes some democrats have even begun to 
think abortion may be that soughtafter wedge issue an 
emotionpacked weapon that could divide republicans and draw back 
to the democratic party young voters aged 18 to 30 who began 
drifting to reagan and the republicans a decade ago 
the wedge they hope could be used to separate ideologically 
conservative republicans from those younger voters who were drawn 
to the gop on economic issues but who have never held the 
conservative views on social issues that the ideological 
conservatives and evangelical republicans have 
in 1980 a trend began that was a very serious threat to 
democrats losing younger voters said frank greer a democratic 
political consultant who has produced a groundbreaking appeal to 
conservatives based on the abortion issue in virginia 
all of a sudden young voters have awoken to the fact 
republicans are out of touch with their social concerns greer 
said i think its a watershed political event and youre seeing 
it in virginia 
republicans dispute that view and say the abortion issue is 
still developing 
one assumes the prolife people will get their act together 
said mahe a consultant to the republican national committee in 
last years presidential race they will attempt to frame the 
issue in ways that benefit them then well see this is still 
unknown 
but the change has been felt in congress and the states already 
one result is that abortion opponents no longer instill the same 
fear they once did among members of congress who had seen 
prochoice candidates such as former sen dick clark of iowa lose 
in 1978 in defeats laid to the abortion issue 
in the past the only people we heard from were people who say 
in no circumstances should abortion be performed said hefner 
who contended his switch on the issue merely returned his position 
to the way he had voted in years past other people who 
represent what i think is a more reasonable position are being 
heard from more 
the houses narrow 216206 vote was to broaden the circumstances 
under which poor women may obtain a federally financed abortion to 
include rape and incest as well as the existing provision for 
cases where the mothers life is in danger 
in floridas legislature the antiabortion republican gov bob 
martinez suffered total defeat in the special session he convened 
to impose new restrictions on abortion 
and in states such as new jersey and virginia abortion emerged 
as a powerful issue in the hands of democratic candidates for 
governor who support continuing legal abortions 
in virginia the example is striking democrat douglas wilder 
has moved into a lead according to independent polls after three 
weeks of airing television advertising that attacks his republican 
opponent as trying to take away a womans right to an abortion 
in a conservative state that was once capital of the 
confederacy wilders ads are crafted to appeal to conservatives 
arguing that his opponent would take away rights and allow 
government intrusion in personal affairs 
wilder incidentally is seeking to become the first black 
elected governor of a state 
if anyone had bet me that a black man would be running for 
governor of virginia and winning using abortion as an issue i 
probably would have lost every nickel i had mused liberal 
pollster harrison hickman

japanese and us leaders must work to curb 
the growing criticism coming from opposite sides of the pacific 
says a senior member of the house foreign affairs committee 
i am concerned about the tone of the relationship and the 
extent to which more and more it has become subject of criticism in 
congress and outside with comparable echoes in japan rep 
stephen solarz dny told a gathering friday of the washington 
foreign correspondents association 
we need leadership to make clear that while the relationship 
is not without differences and difficulties it is of enormous 
benefit said solarz 
he is one of the most influential democrats engaged in foreign 
affairs fellow party members are among washingtons staunchest 
critics of japanese trade policies 
solarz commented on a recent us opinion poll showing that the 
loss of american jobs to imports the multibillion dollar trade 
deficit with japan and heavy japanese investment in us real 
estate and industry have prompted many americans to regard japan as 
posing a greater threat to their future than that posed by the 
soviet union under president mikhail gorbachev 
americans are the victims of our own success solarz said 
we helped build the japanese economy from the ashes of war we 
benefit greatly from their economic progress we ought to find ways 
to continue to benefit japan is certainly not a threat to the 
united states 
he also acknowledged that the threat of war with the soviet 
union is declining thanks to gorbachevs policies of restructuring 
and openness solarz who chairs the house asiapacific 
subcommittee closely follows europe because he represents a 
brooklyn ny district with people of mainly european ancestry 
including many recent immigrants 
asked if the united states should advocate independence for the 
baltic soviet republics in the western part of the ussr even 
if meant gorbachevs ouster solarz said it was a mistake to link 
us policy with the survival of a particular political leader 
if gorbachev were forced to resign it would be a source of 
dismay given the possibilities of his policies but hopefully 
a new leadership would be committed to the same policy he said

alliance demanded the recall of the us ambassador and defended an 
attack on his residence 
leaders of chonminyon an alliance of dissident groups said at

people the group earlier issued a statement demanding an end to 
ties with the united states

house early friday and went on a halfhour rampage hurling tear 
gas and breaking objects with iron bars before police seized them 
gregg and his wife escaped unharmed 
police said security had been tightened at all us government 
facilities since the attack 
embassy officials said they would review the security system of 
greggs residence in downtown seoul unlike the us embassy it is 
not guarded by us marines but by south korean police 
in addition to the attack on the greggs home police reported 
antius protests on 26 campuses in seven cities friday

guerrilla commanders and 
government representatives sit down monday to discuss how their 
forces might stop killing each other but significant progress 
seems unlikely as this countrys civil war enters its second decade 
the meeting is set for san jose costa rica but violence has 
surged in advance of the talks and each side has accused the other 
of ill will though neither wants to be seen as the bad guy who 
breaks up the talks 
the rightist administration of president alfredo cristiani wants 
the oct 1617 session to produce an immediate cessation of 
hostilities cristiani says that will be virtually the sole subject 
of discussion with other matters such as possible political or 
economic changes left for later 
the insurgents reject the immediate ceasefire proposal saying 
it would be suicide to stop fighting before negotiating terms under 
which the war should end 
an estimated 70000 people have been killed in the 10yearold 
war between the marxistled farabundo marti national liberation 
front or fmln and a succession of usbacked governments an 
oct 15 1979 coup by young military officers is regarded as the 
start of the conflict 
the rebels are fighting to abolish what they contend is an 
oligarchic system that has enriched a tiny minority of this 
nations 5 million people while leaving the majority impoverished 
the rebels and the government met in mexico city last month in 
an atmosphere characterized as cordial and constructive although 
the only substantive agreement was to meet monthly in the future 
the mexico city meeting was the first between the guerrillas and 
a salvadoran government since 1987 and followed aug 7 accords 
calling for peace talks signed by cristiani and other central 
american presidents cristiani also called for talks when he took 
office june 1 
the guerrillas terms for a ceasefire include beginning a 
reform of the conservativecontrolled judiciary a halt to 
repression by security forces trials for death squad members 
overhaul of the 1983 constitution and legislative elections 
earlier than their scheduled date of 1991 
the rebels also want guarantees their forces will not be 
attacked or harassed by the numerically superior and 
betterequipped government army prior to eventual demobilization 
but it is doubtful the government will discuss any of these 
things this week 
we do not intend to negotiate a political platform with the 
fmln cristiani said recently that is what the fmln once it 
is part of the democratic process will have to negotiate with the 
salvadoran people if it hopes to obtain political power 
the insurgents say the governments insistence that they simply 
lay down their arms and join the democratic process is 
tantamount to a call for their surrender 
that is absurd said ferman cienfuegos one of the five 
guerrilla commanders in an interview in nicaragua surrender 
would be political suicide 
the government has adopted a position as if we had been 
defeated when it is obvious we have not been defeated said 
leonel gonzalez another commander 
an estimated 7000 fulltime revolutionary combatants and about 
twice that many militia fighters control a swath of northern and 
eastern el salvador and mount attacks in all 14 provinces 
cristiani denies he is demanding surrender but ricardo 
valdivieso vice minister for foreign affairs told journalists 
last week the government would insist on demobilization of the 
insurgent army 
a highranking army officer commander of a garrison in one of 
the hottest war zones was asked if acceptance of an immediate 
ceasefire would harm the guerrillas 
of course it would he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity with a cessation of hostilities we move in the 
battalions to receive their weapons take down their names and send 
them to their homes

conservatives were glad to read that abortion 
reportedly is one of the issues being used by the white house to 
screen candidates for the job of director of the national 
institutes of health 
but a member of the search committee that recommended potential 
candidates said she hoped the volatile issue would not preclude 
our getting the very best scientific leadership for nih 
one of the candidates for the job washington university 
chancellor william danforth brother of sen john danforth rmo 
was asked for his views recently in a call from the white house 
personnel office according to an oct 6 report in science the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science 
science quoted an unidentified colleague as saying danforth was 
asked what his views were on abortion and on fetaltissue research 
the magazine quoted the source as saying danforth told the caller 
if that is all you want to know im not your man 
the magazine said danforth declined to comment on the 
conversation but said the nih job was not my thing and that he 
was wedded to the st louis university 
the search committee that recommended names of potential 
candidates did not assess abortion views during the process said 
virginia weldon a member of the panel and vice president for 
scientific affairs at monsanto co in st louis we didnt 
discuss that she said 
she said she was not surprised the white house would ask about 
abortion views since its a major issue in our country today 
however she added i think it would be very unfortunate if that 
issue precluded our getting the very best scientific leadership for 
the national institutes of health 
asked friday about the since report gary bauer president of 
the conservative family research council and a former domestic 
policy aide in the reagan white house said he would expect the 
white house to be asking those questions 
conservatives have said fetaltissue research is an issue they 
will be watching closely and one that could erupt into a firestorm

never in its traditionbound 203 years 
has the swedish academy an august body of professors authors and 
literary critics been in such a muddle and just before it is to 
award the nobel prize in literature 
angered by its response to the salman rushdie affair three of 
its 18 members have handed in resignation letters but chosen for 
life they cannot quit they must remain until they die 
members claim the rift has not hampered the work of choosing 
this years nobel laureate who is to be announced this month 
but it has exposed tensions inside this elite body and tainted 
its image 
historically internal fighting was been kept within the 
academys 18thcentury walls a members only form of protest has 
been to quietly boycott the weekly meetings 
writer kerstin ekman 56 one of the three rebels has openly 
demanded change saying new and fresh forces are needed in the 
academy 
we would have dug the academys grave had we let the three 
go responded goran malmkvist a professor who joined the academy 
in 1985 who would have agreed to replace them no one 
the work of the prestigious body always has been shrouded in 
tradition and rituals that gave it an air of untouchable noblesse 
that came to an end in march after irans ayatollah ruholla 
khomeini pronounced a death sentence against british author salman 
rushdie for his book the satanic verses which many moslems 
found offensive 
the sentence aroused the fury of literary figures and 
governments around the world 
but the academy after long discussion issued a brief and 
carefully phrased statement defending free expression but without 
explicitly supporting rushdie 
it should be selfevident to everyone that the swedish academy 
firmly repudiates every effort to strangle free speech the 
statement said 
further comment would violate the academys code against 
political involvement academy officials said 
one reason for its deliberate neutrality is to avoid suspicion 
that the nobel prize can be influenced by politics 
along with mrs ekman who at 56 is the youngest academy member 
the other dissenters were lars gyllensten a 71yearold physician 
writer and academy member for 23 years and author werner 
aspenstrom 70 
gyllensten said such vague and obvious remarks from one 
of the worlds most influential literary bodies was in itself a 
political statement 
it must be regarded as political submissiveness which is 
incompatible with the best traditions of the academy and the brave 
choices of nobel winners that i have had the joy and honor to take 
part in he said writing of his determination to quit 
gyllensten called his decision a personal tragedy but said 
he could not accept the academys tiptoeing in sensitive political 
matters 
that makes it impossible to award good nobel prizes he 
wrote in an open letter last month 
there seems no room for compromise since the academy decided 
last month that to accept the three resignations would betray the 
academys history 
we are in a oneway street and there is not much i can do 
gyllensten said 
members have quit the academy before but never three at once 
at the end of last century henning hamilton a senior 
government official was forced to resign over economic 
irregularities in his business professor johan ihre a swedish 
language expert was then elected to the academy but refused to 
join 
some of the academys customs date back to 1786 when it was 
founded by king gustav iii housed in the magnificent stock 
exchange building in old town it has for two centuries been 
charged with the task of furthering the swedish language and 
literature 
but it was alfred nobel inventor of dynamite who made the 
academy world famous by assigning it the duty of awarding a 
literature prize in his name which it has done since 1901 
the academy emerges from its scholastic isolation just one time 
a year when at exactly 1 pm on a thursday in october the 
permament secretary announces the laureate 
the members would like to keep it that way

terry waite the anglican church envoy 
who sought to free american hostages in lebanon and wound up being 
kidnapped marks his 1000th day in captivity sunday with no word 
on his fate 
nothing has been heard of the envoy since he left the riviera 
hotel in moslem west beirut at 730 pm on jan 20 1987 to meet 
with the shiite moslem kidnappers of two americans he was trying to 
free 
in england prayer vigils organized by the church army the 
church of englands evangelical branch were held friday to mark 
waites 1000th day as a hostage 
i really do think that he is still alive his mother lena 
said i feel he is he would hate to be shut up like that but i 
am sure he will come through all right 
waite was on his fifth mission to beirut when he disappeared he 
told his tough druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort him 
to the clandestine meeting at an undisclosed site 
well informed sources said at the time that waite was driven to 
the home of a shiite moslem physician who had acted as a 
gobetween he was apparently to contact representatives of islamic 
jihad which holds us hostages terry anderson and thomas 
sutherland 
waite never returned and it is widely believed he became a 
captive of the iranianbacked shiite moslem extremists 
the 50yearold envoy a policemans son who became the personal 
emissary of archbishop of canterbury robert runcie is one of five 
britons missing in lebanon 
thirteen other westerners including eight americans are 
missing all americans are believed held by shiite factions 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press has been held longer than any hostage he was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
several rumors about waites fate have circulated he has been 
reported ill killed wounded while trying to escape smuggled to 
iran in a coffin to stand trial as an american spy and ransomed 
for 7 million 
no group has claimed to hold him and there have been no 
photographs or videotapes to prove he is alive the british 
government says no demands have been made for his freedom 
but other western hostages freed since waite disappeared have 
reported seeing a man believed to be the towering 6foot 7inch 
briton in an underground prison 
druse warlord walid jumblatt who says he will pursue every lead 
to try to free waite has accused the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god of holding waite 
hezbollah believed to be the umbrella for groups holding most 
of the westerners denies the allegation 
ten days after waite vanished runcie said the envoy had left 
written instructions that he wanted no ransom paid or rescue 
mission attempted if he was kidnapped during his mission 
waites disappearance came months after the disclosure that the 
united states had traded arms for hostages 
three americans held by islamic jihad were freed following the 
delivery of us weapons to iran in 198586 during its war with 
iraq 
waite had been credited with securing the release of the three 
the rev benjamin weir the rev laurence jenco and david jacobson 
until the us dealings with tehran were disclosed in november 
1986 
there have been reports islamic jihad decided to hold waite 
responsible for failing to secure the freedom of 15 proiranian 
extremists imprisoned in kuwait for a string of 1983 bombings 
freeing those men had been islamic jihads main demand

a spare engine computer checked out 
fine saturday and nasa cleared space shuttle atlantis for launch on 
tuesday with the jupiterbound galileo probe 
officials said the countdown interrupted after a previous 
computer developed a problem would resume at 1201 am monday 
aiming for liftoff during a 26minute period starting at 1257 pm 
tuesday 
the repair was accomplished with great efficiency by a 
dedicated team often facing unfavorable weather conditions said 
robert crippen deputy director of shuttle operations we can now 
proceed to launch the galileo mission to jupiter 
the faulty computer which forced postponement of a planned 
thursday launch was removed and a spare installed friday testing 
of the new unit was completed saturday and workers began closing up 
the engine compartment removing work platforms and reinstalling 
heat shields 
the 230pound 6 million computer controls all functions of one 
of atlantis three main engines during launch its failure could 
lead to an engine shutdown and an emergency landing for the shuttle 
a longrange weather forecast said conditions on tuesday will be 
70 percent favorable it said there was a 20 percent probability of 
showers or thunderstorms and a 10 percent chance of winds from the 
southeast exceeding the launch limit of 23 mph 
the five astronauts who will fly the mission were to return here 
from their training base in houston they had gone back there after 
the thursday launch date was scrubbed 
they are commander donald williams pilot mike mcculley and 
mission specialists ellen baker franklin changdiaz and shannon 
lucid 
during the fiveday mission the astronauts are to release the 
nuclearpowered galileo spacecraft on the start of a sixyear 
journey to jupiter the craft is to shoot a probe into the jovian 
atmosphere and orbit the planet examining it for 22 months 
a federal judge on tuesday rejected a request by three 
environmental groups to halt the flight for fear the galileo could 
scatter plutonium its nuclear fuel over florida if the shuttle 
exploded 
the groups appealed the ruling to the us court of appeals on 
friday 
bruce gagnon of the florida coalition for peace and justice one 
of the three organizations said that if the court rules against 
them opponents planned to try to infiltrate the launch area on 
tuesday in an effort to stop the liftoff

loyalists and royalists rubbed shoulders 
with communists and islamic fundamentalists saturday to register as 
candidates in this kingdoms first general election in 22 years 
it means we are returning back to democratic life said poet 
and journalist abdulrahim omar who is seeking a parliamentary 
seat in the capital it means we will again have an independent 
legislative authority 
omar held one of the small blue number tags officials passed out 
to control the flow of candidates as registration began in amman 
officials have said 1000 or more people are considering a run 
for the 80 parliamentary seats being contested nov 8 
it will be jordans first nationwide balloting since april 1967 
a few months before the middle east war with israel of the 
countrys 3 million people 1 million are registered voters 
candidates have three days to register and officials then have 
three days to reject those not considered qualified anyone 
rejected by the regional governor can appeal to the courts which 
must rule in another three days 
although jordanian law prohibits members of banned organizations 
from seeking election officials have hinted they will permit 
members of the outlawed communist party and other leftist groups to 
run 
the law allowed official campaigning to begin saturday and 
amman residents awoke to find campaign banners suspended over city 
streets and leaflets stuffed under windshield wipers of their cars 
there is no glory except in islam proclaimed a banner 
hoisted by two islamic candidates above a busy street in the jebel 
hussein district 
woman is half of the society she is the one who raises the 
future generations announced another banner directed at women 
who are taking part in nationwide voting for the first time in 
jordans history 
women gained the vote in 1974 but only a handful of local 
district elections have been held since then 
nationwide voting was impossible after 1967 when israel 
captured the west bank because that territory contained half the 
60 seats in jordans old parliament 
but king hussein last year renounced claims to the west bank in 
favor of the palestine liberation organization and the government 
drew up plans for a new parliament that will omit representation 
for the west bank for the first time since 1950 
the parliament elected in 1967 was suspended in 1974 and revived 
a decade later with a few elections to fill gaps caused by death 
it was generally compliant to government will despite a few vocal 
critics 
most candidates and analysts have said the new parliament will 
take a more active role especially following the widespread 
rioting that erupted in april to protest price increases 
scores of candidates gathered saturday morning at the amman 
governors office to register tribal sheiks in flowing robes 
waited in line chatting with businessmen in suits and islamic 
fundamentalists 
it feels great to have democracy back to our country under the 
leadership of his majesty king hussein said hamad abu jamus a 
retired army brigadier general seeking election in amman 
we have been waiting for this for the past 22 years he said 
dr ali hawamdeh a leader of the moslem brotherhood said he 
expected his and other islamic groups to back about 30 candidates 
seeking morality clean government social justice and a hard line 
toward israel 
the plo has distanced itself from the election to avoid a 
conflict with jordan but many candidates are appealing to 
palestinian sentiments especially in amman where some 70 percent 
of people come from palestinian families 
we salute the children of the stones proclaimed a banner 
raised by candidate carlos dames referring to youths of the 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and gaza 
strip

four young men who pulled crab traps from 
the st johns river while looking for a good time on a holiday 
weekend began paying their their debt to society saturday by 
parading on a bridge with signs admitting their acts 
the men carried handlettered signs reading it is a felony 
punishable by prison andor a 5000 fine to molest crab pots i 
know because i molested one 
as they trudged the twotenths of a mile to the top of a bridge 
over the st johns river and back down the four were accompanied 
by michael west a probation officer from this town about 50 miles 
south of jacksonville 
all four refused to talk to reporters a few motorists honked at 
them but no problems occurred 
jacksonville insurance salesman stephen michael kittredge one 
of the four men caught raiding seven traps in may said earlier 
that too much beer and too little common sense were to blame 
it was memorial day weekend we were just a bunch of guys 
looking for a good time we were probably a little bit drunk we 
were wrong we readily admit we were wrong the 23yearold 
kittredge said 
he and pals john shiver snelling 24 gregory coleman dyer 24 
and david todd harris 23 agreed to walk with the 
posterboardsize placards for four weekends in exchange for having 
prosecutors drop charges 
this a felony situation and you are looking at guys that all 
have careers said putnam county probation director vicky weaver 
robert scholl the fisherman who lost 30 crabs to the men said 
the public humiliation is not enough punishment he wanted them 
convicted and fined the maximum 
you could shoot them at daylight and that might not satisfy 
him countered ms weaver 
assistant state attorney richard whitson said the public display 
will do more to help the crabbing industry than jailing the four 
men 
each man must also pay scholl five times the cost of the lost 
catch or an estimated 675 each ms weaver said 
though unhappy with the punishment scholl acknowledged that 
its going to be very expensive crab meat 
fishermen leave the underwater traps unattended for hours 
attached to floating markers while they make their rounds picking 
up their catch and replacing bait 
a crab fisherman for 17 years scholl estimates he loses 1000 
a year in equipment to thefts not counting the lost catch 
the men walking the bridge saturday also will carry signs on the 
municipal dock and at the county courthouse on subsequent weekends 
kittredge and harris a real estate broker live in 
jacksonville snelling is a law student living in atlanta and dyer 
is a sales representative in fort myers for a medical supply 
company 
kittredge said the four men were spending the weekend on a 
houseboat when a trap got caught in a boat propeller and rose to 
the surface they were arrested june 6 by sheriffs officers who 
had been tipped off to the mens boat number 
it looked like lunch in the pot to them it could have been a 
5000 lunch whitson said

president augusto pinochet said he plans 
to dissolve the secret police agency that human rights activists 
blamed saturday for some of the most brutal and sinister crimes of 
his ironfisted regime 
pinochet answering questions from local reporters friday in the 
southern town of coihaique said the national information center 
will be scrapped before an elected civilian government takes power 
in march 
he said the agency will be phased out because it is an organ 
that served this government 
he did not elaborate saying only i cant say now what will 
happen to its men 
roberto garreton legal chief for the solidarity vicariate human 
rights group said the agency inflicted horrendous crimes on the 
populace 
just as pinochet recognizes the cni was at the service of his 
government which is to say at his service and not at the service 
of the country thats why the institution will disappear when the 
government changes he said 
pinochet the army commander who seized power in a bloody 1973 
coup lost a referendum a year ago on extending his rule to 1997 
the loss obliged him to call elections scheduled for december 14 
to pick a civilian successor who will take power march 11 
in a telephone interview with the associated press garreton 
said the secret police force has been linked to the most sinister 
activities of the regime in recent years including the torture 
and killing of leftists 
the solidarity vicariate sponsored by the local roman catholic 
church is among the countrys most respected human rights agencies 
all three presidential candidates pledged to abolish the police 
agency if elected 
the agency was created in 1977 to replace another secret police 
force the national intelligence directorate after it was linked 
to the assassination of prominent dissidents abroad the cnis 
directors all have been army generals and most of its officers are 
armed forces members 
former finance minister hernan buchi opposition leader patricio 
aylwin and independent businessman francisco errazuriz are running 
for the presidency aylwin backed by a 17party centerleft 
coalition that triumphed in the referendum leads by a substantial 
margin in most polls 
in his comments to reporters in coihaique 1350 miles south of 
santiago pinochet also hinted at military action if armed forces 
members are persecuted by the new government 
the day they touch one of my men the state of law ends he 
declared i say this only once and wont say it again but they 
know thats how it is 
texts of his exchange with reporters were carried saturday by 
santiago newspapers 
pinochet previously has warned he will not accept prosecution 
under the new government of armed forces members on charges of 
human rights abuse hundreds of cases of illegal arrest torture 
and other rights violations are pending in the chilean courts

more than three weeks after hurricane 
hugo slammed into this bedroom community the buzz of chainsaws 
drowns out most sounds as the town struggles toward recovery 
schools are open again the power is on traffic is heavy on 
main street and most businesses have reopened but physical and 
emotional scars from the hurricane run deep and will not be eased 
anytime soon residents say 
things will probably never be the same resident jessica 
brown said recently this neighborhood is still in shock about a 
lot of things 
her house in the college park subdivision suffered extensive 
water damage when the sept 21 hurricane lifted the roof moved the 
house off its foundation and sent rain cascading into the attic 
things have hit us pretty hard mrs brown said i lost a 
10monthold baby a week before the storm and we were trying to get 
our lives back together then this happened 
an insurance adjuster has yet to make it to her house but she 
said she doesnt really mind because a lot of people are a lot 
worse off than me 
across south carolina the hurricane left 18 dead 270000 
jobless at least 50000 homeless and 4 billion or more in damage 
president bush made a quick unscheduled visit to this community 
of 18000 as part of his trip to the state a week after hugo roared 
through he promised federal aid and a few days later the federal 
emergency management agency opened a disaster center here 
while other cities and towns such as charleston 20 miles to the 
south mcclellanville and sumter were hit harder and still struggle 
to get lifes necessities back summerville is edging toward 
recovery 
but the reminders of hugo remain 
summerville was settled in the 1700s as south carolinas first 
resort by wealthy charlestonians who sought refuge from the 
diseasebearing mosquitoes which swarmed coastal marshes in the 
summer 
the towns centerpiece azalea park was awash during the spring 
with crimson lavender and white blossoms today it is littered 
with fallen pine trees and massive oaks now twisted and splintered 
like matchsticks 
cars still have plastic covering smashed windows piles of tree 
limbs line the curbs waiting for removal plywood has replaced 
broken store windows and carpenters are busy patching damaged roofs 
yet residents say good things were spawned by the destruction 
neighbors finally got to know each other as they shared food 
cooked on outdoor grills and helped clear streets of fallen limbs 
im closer to my friends and neighbors some we didnt really 
know leanne junkins said the friendship and caring that all 
these people had for everybody else without putting a price tag on 
it you cant beat that kind of love 
now that schools have reopened people are back to work and into 
a routine again it has been easier to cope with the devastation 
mrs junkins said 
in diane turocys neighborhood she became something of a 
celebrity when a picture of her and president bush was flashed 
around the globe it was a moment she never expected 
were starting to settle into a routine were just trying to 
get on with our lives she said when a secret service agent 
knocked at her door on the morning of sept 29 
i greeted him in my nightgown and he said would you like to 
meet the president you have two minutes 
the visit was just a tremendous boost for a small town she 
said

surveying the wreckage from the secondlargest 
point decline in stock market history fed and bush administration 
officials reviewed contingency plans saturday and tried to project 
an air of calm watchfulness 
unlike his action following the record 508point drop in the 
stock market on black monday two years ago federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan did not issue a statement pledging that the 
central bank stands ready to supply needed bank reserves to cushion 
the new shock to the financial system 
a fed official speaking on condition that his name not be used 
said such a statement was not necessary 
he said reports coming in from commercial banks indicated that 
none of them is facing a credit squeeze as a result of the friday 
market plunge which wiped out nearly 200 billion in stock values 
greenspans decisive action to supply plentiful credit to the 
banking system two years ago won widespread praise at the time as a 
key factor in keeping the market turmoil from sending the entire 
economy into a tailspin 
the contingency plan drawn up by greenspan still exists but 
there has been no need to put it into effect a fed official said 
saturday 
officials said no thought is being given to canceling a 
scheduled speech by greenspan to the american bankers association 
on monday in 1987 greenspan did cancel his planned address before 
the aba convention in dallas to fly back to washington to take 
charge of monitoring market developments 
for its part the bush administration sought to dismiss any 
efforts to compare fridays 190point plunge to the 1987 crash 
no one looks at this as anything at all like october 1987 
said a treasury official speaking on condition of anonymity 
president bush spent the wekend at camp david md and the 
white house issued no statements on his behalf 
aides to treasury secretary nicholas brady said he had discussed 
fridays developments with greenspan and richard breeden who was 
sworn in three days ago as the new chairman of the securities and 
exchange commission 
brady who also was in touch with officials at the new york 
stock exchange and the chicago mercantile exchange said in a 
statement late friday that the stock decline doesnt signal any 
fundamental change in the condition of the economy with the 
prospects still favorable for continued expansion 
private economists tended to agree with this assessment saying 
there are a variety of differences between 1989 and 1987 
in the 1987 crash interest rates were shooting upward and the 
dollar was extremely weak two factors that added to investor 
uncertainty this time interest rates have been steady and the 
dollar has been showing surprising strength 
in 1987 we had an allout panic said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer this has been a collapse confined primarily to 
leveragedbuyout activity which had been driving the market upward 
this year 
still analysts said that monday could be a rough day in the 
markets especially if fridays weakness in new york spills over 
into the tokyo stock exchange when it opens late sunday night 
in 1987 a 109point drop on friday oct 16 triggered selling 
on foreign exchanges which then contributed to the 508point plunge 
on monday 
michael evans a washington economist who had predicted in his 
most recent news letter that the stock market was on the verge of a 
big selloff said saturday he expects the market to drop an 
additional 300 points 
but evans said even with this pessimistic outlook he did not 
expect the us economy to be pushed into a recession 
this doesnt tell us anything about the real economy it tells 
us that there has been a squeeze on corporate profits this year 
he said 
many economists said they expected the fed would begin pushing 
interest rates lower in coming weeks but that it will be very 
gradual to avoid the appearance that the central bank was bowing to 
political pressure from the administration which has been pushing 
for lower rates for some time 
jones said he was looking for the bellwether federal funds rate 
the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fall 
to 8 percent from the current 9 percent over the next two months 
he said he was also looking for a cut in the feds discount rate in 
that time period 
many of the countrys top corporate executives at a meeting of 
the business council in hot springs va also expressed confidence 
that fridays market turmoil will have no significant impact on the 
economy which they said will slow next year but then rebound with 
faster growth in 1991 
aw clausen head of bank of america said the fact that 
greenspan led the country through the 1987 crash gave him 
confidence government officials will know how to handle the current 
turmoil 
allan greenspan is a seasoned veteran he managed our way 
through the last time and i have utmost confidence in his 
abilities he said 
but not all executives were as sanguine about the markets 
immediate prospects 
rand v araskog chairman of itt corp blamed a lack of 
government controls on corporate takeovers for the speculative 
fever which drove stock prices to unjustified highs 
a lot of people are saying no problem this isnt 1987 but 
who knows he told reporters if the tokyo and london markets 
stay stable then it could stay stable here but if they dont 
then we could have a rough time on monday

those refugees and more than 13000 who had occupied the west 
german embassy in prague czechoslovakia were required to pass 
through east germany in trains before being formally expelled to 
the west 
the new plan drops that requirement allowing the east germans 
to fly out of poland once they obtain the necessary documents 
this could spare east germany a repeat of the near riots that 
occurred in some east german cities when citizens tried to climb 
aboard the trains going west 
smiling young refugees being housed at a church seminary in 
tarchomin just outside warsaw said they were told saturday night 
by a west german diplomat that transport either by air or ship was 
being arranged for them by the end of the week 
the refugees mainly skilled workers in their 20s and 30s said 
they celebrated with beer vodka and music after they first got 
hints of the deal from west german radio broadcasts 
we were all in one room when we heard and things were wild 
said a young man washing dishes in the seminary kitchen 
as some of the 120 refugees at the seminary were sitting down to 
supper a young west german diplomat was handing out a singlesheet 
form titled request for release from citizenship of the german 
democratic republic refugees were eagerly filling it out 
it was unclear if the arrangement announced saturday would apply 
to east germans who make their way to warsaw in the future despite 
east german attempts to limit travel to poland by not issuing exit 
permits about 120 east germans have been arriving daily 
poland maintains it is trying to prevent illegal border 
crossings but once east germans are safely past the polish border 
authorities have been taking no steps to determine the legality of 
their entry 
instead polish officials have been working privately with the 
roman catholic church and the polish red cross to provide 
comfortable housing for the refugees 
east germanys main party newspapers saturday covered a broad 
range of political and economic concerns that have fueled the 
nationwide unrest 
the depth and extent of the criticism was unparalleled in the 
40year history of east germanys drab print media which 
traditionally have devoted most space to reports on production 
successes and attacks on the west 
the communist party newspaper neues deutschland published 22 
letters from concerned readers 
i believe its time for a thorough explanation about the 
causes of the tense and uneasy situation in our country wrote 
karin hornig the time has come for our media to report whats 
really going on in the country 
manuela auras from the small town of aue wrote my 
colleagues and i hope that there will be constructive changes 
especially in the media in travel possibilities and in industry 
neues deutschland also published lengthy articles in which 
workers blasted visiting party officials about work conditions 
unfair pay scales and travel restrictions

labor secretary elizabeth dole on saturday 
convened the first meeting of the heads of the pittston company and 
the united mine workers since a strike began six months ago and 
said she would soon appoint a super mediator in a new effort to 
end the coalfield war 
a day after she visited both strikers and company officials in 
virginia coal towns mrs dole presided over a 90minute session in 
her office with pittston chairman paul douglas and umw president 
richard trumka she called it a very good meeting and said 
both these gentlemen are committed to ending this dispute and 
agreed that i appoint a super mediator 
this will be a person of stature and i will make that 
appointment just as soon as feasible the labor secretary said 
both douglas and trumka left her office without commenting to 
reporters the two had not met since 1695 miners in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky went on strike april 5 against pittston coal 
group incs mines in virginia west virginia and kentucky the 
parent pittston company is based in greenwich conn 
talks between lowerlevel negotiators conducted for weeks under 
the auspices of the federal mediation and conciliation service 
have produced virtually no progress mrs dole lauded the fmcs 
effort but acknowledged it was time to try something different 
she characterized her tour friday as emotionally wrenching 
saying i saw families against families brothers against 
brothers this is tearing entire communities apart 
the time is right she said for me to offer my offices to 
move forward with a super mediator 
health benefits not wages are chiefly at issue in the dispute 
pittston bolted from the bituminous coal operators association last 
year saying the nationwide contract the association had negotiated 
with the umw gave too much to the miners particularly in medical 
benefits for pensioners the company then sought to negotiate its 
own contract and reduce those benefits 
trumka had asked repeatedly to meet directly with douglas but 
douglas had declined until mrs dole invited both men to her 
office douglas previously had argued that local managers were 
better qualified to address the mining issues 
the strike has become a rallying point for organized labor 
across the country union leaders contend the company is attempting 
to break the umw with a contract that would threaten the stability 
of the unions pension fund pittston has denied trying to rid 
itself of organized employees

us authorities flew three suspected drug 
traffickers to jails in florida and michigan early saturday in the 
second extradition from colombia since emergency measures were 
imposed there in august 
one of them has already been convicted in absentia in detroit 
florida prosecutors called one of the others a big fish 
us marshals said the three were turned over to us officials 
in colombia about 3 am and flown to miami where one was dropped 
off the flight then continued to orlando and detroit to deliver 
the other two marshals said the three were being held in 
secure detention facilities in the three areas but declined to 
be more specific 
the extraditions bring to four the number of people brought to 
this country from colombia since president virgilio barco imposed 
emergency measures against drug traffickers aug 18 
i commend president barco and the government of colombia for 
their continued diligence in the war against narcoterrorists 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement 
the colombian people are setting an example for the world as 
they continue to extradite international drug traffickers in the 
face of continued threats and acts of intimidation thornburgh 
said 
justice department spokesman david runkel identified the three 
defendants as ana rodriguez de tamayo roberto peter carliniarrico 
and bernardo pelaez roldan 
the us marshals service said de tamayo 50 faces charges in 
miami of cocaine importation and conspiracy to possess with intent 
to distribute cocaine 
carliniarrico 38 faces federal charges of possession with 
intent to distribute 7000 pounds of marijuana and importing 7000 
pounds of marijuana in the middle district of florida at orlando 
marshals said 
three other defendants in that federal case are in custody and 
the trial is scheduled for november runkel said 
assistant state attorney andy zelman said carliniarrico is 
accused by state authorities of smuggling more than a ton of 
cocaine during the mid1980s 
state prosecutor peter antonacci said the 1986 state charges 
against carliniarrico consist of one count each of racketeering 
conspiracy to commit racketeering cocaine trafficking and 
conspiracy to traffic the drug each state count carries a 15year 
mandatory minimum sentence 
carliniarrico who had florida addresses in boca raton and 
gainesville fled the country following the state indictments said 
antonacci 
he is a big fish said antonacci we are glad well get a 
chance to prosecute 
pelaez 44 was convicted in absentia in detroit in march 1984 
of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine 
barco allowed extradition among other emergency measures that 
followed the assassination of a leading presidential candidate who 
was an outspoken foe of the drug trade 
colombias supreme court has upheld the decision to resume 
extraditions to the united states in 1987 it had blocked 
extraditions 
the first reputed drug trafficker extradited since the emergency 
actions went into effect was eduardo martinez romero who was taken 
to the united states on sept 6 to face money laundering charges 
brought in march in atlanta 
since barco imposed the emergency measures drug traffickers in 
colombia have declared total war on the government they have 
been held responsible for setting off more than 150 bombs that have 
killed more than 10 people and wounded at least 200

the nations top business leaders 
tallied losses in their personal stock portfolios on saturday but 
many said the market collapse a day earlier could be a boon if its 
cools a corporate takeover fever 
the 190point plunge of the dow jones industrial average friday 
was a surprise intruder at the business councils fall meeting 
held at a posh resort in the blue ridge mountains 
the markets plunge wiped out 200 billion of stock values 
overall leaving many of the executives poorer on paper than when 
they arrived 
george keller retired chairman of chevron corp said he 
figured the oneday market drop had cost him 250000 other 
executives traded similar tales of woe 
despite the precipitous drop in stock values for their 
companies however many of the executives expressed belief that 
some good could come from the market correction if it ends the 
takeover fever that has been driving stock prices this year 
much of the loss occurred in the last hour of trading on friday 
after news reports that the pending takeover of ual corp parent 
of united airlines was in jeopardy because of financing problems 
this sparked fears among stock traders that the surge of 
multibilliondollar corporate takeovers was coming to an end and 
helped trigger the selling frenzy many analysts believe 
since many of the corporate executives have had to fend off 
unwanted takeovers in the past something that dampened this 
activity could be seen as a welcome development in their eyes 
for example one executive at the meeting american airlines 
president robert l crandall is currently facing a takeover bid 
from new york real estate developer donald trump 
asked if fridays developments could help him fend off trumps 
bid crandall merely smiled and said no comment 
rand v araskog chairman of itt corp was more blunt in his 
criticism of the reagan and bush administrations for doing nothing 
to curb speculative takeovers 
we have a very nervous marketplace he said are the 
lawyers and investment bankers in charge or is the president of the 
united states in charge 
he said the whole attitude of deregulation of the marketplace 
over the past eight years was not contributing to the longterm 
growth prospects of the united states 
allen murray chairman of mobil corp said fridays market 
decline could end up being a good thing if market speculators are 
replaced by longterm investors 
i am anxious to see the market move up but i am anxious to 
see it move up on investments and not speculation he said 
that will be better for the country 
many of the business executives were hesitant to make 
predictions about what might happen when the markets open again 
monday 
the markets have had enormous growth and now an adjustment 
process has set in said ibm chairman john akers the markets 
do what the markets want to do 
while murray denied that any crisis atmosphere existed john f 
mcgillicuddy chairman of manufacturers hanover corp said 
anytime you have the market drop by 190 points if you arent 
concerned theres something wrong with you 
general motors chairman roger smith refused to make a prediction 
on whether fridays plunge would be followed by further selling 
monday saying it was hard to guess what the markets herd 
instinct might do 
itts araskog agreed everybody can tell everybody to be calm 
cool and collected he said but when they start trading calm 
cool and collected doesnt work any more

they had to change some of the songs at 
deerfield academy this fall it hardly seemed appropriate to sing 
about the sons of deerfield after 123 girls got to the prep 
school 
and the library sculpture the deerfield boy is getting a 
sister statue in the deerfield girl 
but students and administrators said those are just cosmetic 
changes that dont begin to tell the story of what it means to 
reverse 41 years of history as an allmale school 
when you see the girls on campus sometimes you doubletake 
said ryan scannell a 15yearold junior from worcester but im 
used to it now 
a few boys have refused to sing the new genderneutral version 
of an old school song steadfastly singing the sons of deerfield 
rally as the first line instead of deerfield o deerfield 
rally 
one of the new arrivals said she understands those feelings 
theres 40 some odd years of deerfield that are just sort of 
locked up in that song said rachel reingold a 16yearold 
sophomore from greenwich conn who reports that her welcome was 
warmer than she expected 
deerfield a collection of elegant brick buildings clustered in 
the historic section of old deerfield was founded by frank l 
boyden just after the turn of the century it originally was a coed 
school but in 1948 the school went allboy after the number of 
female students dwindled to just a handful the changeover back to 
coeducation was approved in 1987 
the headmaster said during the years of planning for the change 
they were told to expect some initial academic distraction as 
boys and girls socialized 
students put it more bluntly in two or three more weeks 
therell be like couples everywhere reingold said 
the 123 girls account for about a fifth of the student body of 
502 boarders and 68 day students

forty bodies many piled on burning 
tires were found in a nearby town bringing a weeklong death toll 
to more than 200 the government said saturday 
authorities blamed no specific group for the killings which 
occurred since friday night in and around kelaniya five miles 
north of colombo but progovernment vigilantes were believed 
responsible 
a government statement said the deaths brought to 211 the number 
of people killed in the past week including 121 by vigilantes 94 
by sinhalese radicals and 36 extremists by security forces 
independent sources claimed the toll was about 350 which would 
be the most in a week in recent months 
sinhalese radicals in the ultranationalist peoples liberation 
front have attacked the sinhalesedominated government since the 
signing of a peace accord in july 1987 designed to give greater 
autonomy to the island nations tamil minority a 6yearold tamil 
separatist war has left at least 11000 people dead 
human rights groups say the vigilante groups indiscriminately 
kill civilians who associate with the liberation front and burn 
their bodies beyond recognition 
the government admits the existence of death squads but denies 
large scale killings it blames the front for most of the 5000 
deaths since 1987 in southern and central sri lanka the sinhalese 
heartland 
the front has rejected president ranasinghe premadasas peace 
offers including repeated invitations to a peace conference that 
ended thursday 
the front claims to be a marxist organization but increasingly 
has taken up a banner of ultranationalism for the sinhalese who 
are mostly buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the countrys 16 
million people tamils account for 18 percent of the population and 
are mostly hindus

here are some excerpts from nancy reagans new book my turn 
the memoirs of nancy reagan as provided by newsweek magazine 
of her own advice to her husband i make no apologies for 
telling him what i thought for eight years i was sleeping with 
the president and if that doesnt give you special access i dont 
know what does so yes i gave ronnie my best advice whenever he 
asked for it and sometimes when he didnt but that doesnt mean 
he took it ronald reagan has a mind of his own believe me if i 
was really the dragon lady that donald regan described in his book 
he would have been out the door many months earlier 
on her life in the white house while i loved being first 
lady and i loved being able to make a contribution nevertheless 
my eight years with that title were the most difficult years of my 
life in addition to the painful moments illness the death of my 
mother and father there was the constant schedule and pressure 
and there was the difficulty of living under the intense scrutiny 
of the media the frustration of frequently being misunderstood 
on her soviet counterpart raisa gorbachev from the moment we 
met she talked and talked and talked so much that i could barely 
get a word in edgewise or otherwise perhaps it was insecurity on 
her part but during about a dozen encounters in three different 
countries my fundamental impression of raisa gorbachev was that 
she never stopped talking or lecturing to be more accurate 
on onetime secretary of state al haig as far as im 
concerned al haig represented ronnies biggest mistake of the 
first term he was too powerhungry and obsessed with matters of 
status 
on her relationship with astrologer joan quigley which she 
began after the assassination attempt and continued until its 
disclosure created an uproar joan was helpful and comforting we 
had a professional relationship but i came to view her as a 
friend i now see that she was also a kind of therapist all 
during those years joan quigley was there for me she says the 
only thing influenced by quigleys advice was reagans schedule 
no political decision was ever made based on it quigleys 
advice paid by a third party who was then reimbursed by mrs 
reagan wasnt cheap but she doesnt say how much she was paid 
on the 1981 assassination attempt in which reagan was seriously 
wounded i couldnt help thinking about the fact that john 
hinckley had been possessed with the movie taxi driver about a 
deranged man who stalks a politician i think theres too much 
violence in films and on television and its one of the reasons 
for our terrible problems with crime she says she also is not 
sure she agrees with her husband that gun control is not the 
answer 
on her alleged status as a clotheshorse it infuriated me to 
read that i had been part of the lunch bunch who spend their days 
shopping on rodeo drive i know there are women who shop every day 
and who center their lives on lunch but i didnt do that before 
moving into the white house and i dont do it now it would bore 
the daylights out of me she says however that i do enjoy 
wearing fine clothes and felt she should particularly look her 
best when representing the nation she says borrowing clothing from 
designers as she did is such a widespread and accepted practice 
in the american fashion industry that it never occurred to me that 
id be criticized for it 
on her relationship with her daughter patti davis who wrote a 
novel in 1986 that was an unflattering portrait of a fictional 
first family ive had my ups and downs with all four children 
but my relationship with patti has been one of the most painful and 
disappointing aspects of my life somehow no matter what i do we 
seem to square off she says she read the novel home front 
with sorrow and anger and that patti and her brother ron 
havent spoken since he told her you trashed us all in a terrible 
book 
on a meeting with rosalynn carter a few weeks after reagan 
defeated president carter in the 1980 election the chill in her 
manner matched the chill in the room i was disappointed but i 
also understood as i eventually learned for myself the white 
house is not an easy place to leave

jon speelman of england scored a crushing 30move 
victory over jan timman of the netherlands in the seventh round of 
their world chess championship semifinal saturday to tie the score 
at 35 with one game remaining 
in the other semifinal former world champion anatoly karpov 
held on to draw his sixth game with fellow soviet artur yusupov in 
46 moves and keep the score at 33 
speelman playing black staged his dramatic comeback after poor 
play in his first six games it came at a time when observers were 
begining to write off his chances in the eightgame contest 
jon played just like his old self said an ecstatic jonathan 
tisdall an international master who is speelmans chief second 
as soon as he had a chance he played sharply and very 
aggressively 
despite playing with the advantage of the white pieces karpov 
who was world champion from 1975 until 1985 drifted into an 
unfavorable endgame where experts said yusupov missed two chances 
to win his second game in a row and go ahead in the contest 
ive never seen karpov play so badly said british 
grandmaster tony miles 
the winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world 
champion garri kasparov for his title in a 24game duel beginning 
in october 1990 the winning semifinalists will face off in the 
candidates final next march 
if either contest ends in a 44 tie a twogame mini match 
will be played followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakers 
played at increasingly high speeds 
a win scores one point and a draw a half 
speelman shocked observers on the third move when he played an 
old defense against timmans ruy lopez opening rarely seen in 
topflight chess for the last 60 years 
surprised by the unusual idea timman sank deep into thought 
but a faulty 16th move let speelman seize the initiative timman 
used up more and more time and left himself with only 26 minutes 
thinking time for 20 moves 
as speelman turned on the pressure timman cracked his 27th 
move led to a sequence of moves in which speelman won a bishop 
when timman resigned the crowd in the sadlers wells ballet 
theater rose for a standing ovation but with the two soviets still 
locked in battle speelman gestured to the crowd to be quiet 
after speelman left the stage timman remained in his seat for 
five minutes and watched the karpovyusupov game on the electronic 
demonstration boards 
asked about his chances to win the contest speelman said 
better than this morning 
from a queens gambit yusupov produced a new idea on the 17th 
move and gradually outplayed karpov by combining threats against 
his king and in the center 
by the 30th move the protagonists had exchanged down to an 
endgame with rooks and pawns where yusupov stood a pawn ahead 
soviet international master mark dvoretsky yusupovs chief 
second told reporters yusupov missed two ways to win on moves 37 
and 38 when yusupov missed his chances karpov initiated a series 
of pawn exchanges that led to an easily drawn position 
the eighth game with speelman playing white against timman is 
scheduled for monday although timman has the option to take a 
timeout and postpone the game until tuesday 
with their timeouts exhausted yusupov will play white against 
karpov in their seventh game on monday the eighth game will be on 
tuesday

panicky investors placed sell orders saturday as 
wall street and government officials conferred on the stock 
markets friday the 13th fearing a replay of the 1987 crash when 
the market reopens monday 
charles schwab amp co one of the nations largest discount 
brokerages opened its 110 branches for four hours saturday and was 
flooded with thousands of calls from worried investors who wanted 
to sell stock 
new york stock exchange president richard a grasso spoke by 
telephone with officials in washington at other major exchanges 
and at brokerages to discuss the drop in the market 
were not taking unusual actions today because we feel 
confident that we have put procedures systems and safeguards in 
place over the past two years so that we are adequately prepared 
for any level of activity that may occur on monday nyse 
spokeswoman sharon gamsin said 
the amount of money available to the stock market following the 
selloff the reaction overseas and the future of takeovers all were 
of concern over the weekend 
its fair to say that people were working theyre analyzing 
what happened in the market said securities and exchange 
commission spokeswoman mary mccue i think people will be working 
tomorrow sunday too 
she declined to elaborate on what regulators were analyzing or 
speculate on what steps the sec might take in the event of a severe 
market drop the agency doesnt have the authority to halt trading 
or close any stock exchanges only the chairmen of the exchanges 
and president bush have those powers 
on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
plummeted 19058 points or 691 percent to 256926 erasing 
nearly 200 billion in stocks paper value the plunge was spurred 
by an announcement that financing was unavailable for a 675 
billion buyout of united airlines arent ual corp 
in points the drop was the secondlargest in history behind the 
508point black monday crash of oct 19 1987 the crash was 
preceded by a decline of 108 points the friday before 
san franciscobased charles schwab received 3000 orders within 
one hour of opening with 90 percent on the sell side senior vice 
president hugo quackenbush said 
people are concerned because it reminds them of the 87 crash 
when people got completely out of control quackenbush said 
but he said some customers who called later wanted to buy into 
the fallen market quackenbush expected heavy activity monday and 
said the firm was boosting staff by up to 30 percent 
as in 1987 traders and key officials have the weekend to plan 
strategy and mull the possibility of a precipitous fall 
the extent of the panic that we had in 87 is very different 
than what we had now jack barbanel president of first global 
asset management inc said saturday yesterday i would call a 
reasonably orderly selloff as opposed to what we had in 87 
some analysts said the economys recent underlying strength low 
interest rates and a buoyant dollar distinguish current conditions 
from 1987 
theres clearly some nervousness associated with this decline 
but i think fundamentals will prevail said jack lavery director 
of global equities markets at merrill lynch amp co 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of a house subcommittee 
that oversees the sec said he would request from regulators a 
reconstruction of fridays trading 
this is the second heart attack two years after the first 
said markey who has proposed market reform legislation its 
about time we made the changes necessary to avoid a third 
officials at the federal reserve the nations central bank 
were reported confident that the market had enough liquidity 
that no emergency supply of money was necessary at the moment 
in the event of a sharp selloff stock trading firms might need 
to borrow large amounts of additional money from banks to meet 
their financial obligations in order to keep the system flowing 
smoothly 
after the 1987 crash some banks were reluctant to lend and it 
took pressure from the fed to compel them to supply credit to 
traders and other wall street professionals who needed emergency 
loans 
one of the lessons of two years ago is that its very 
important that there be sufficient liquidity to handle whatever 
the transactional volume is said sen donald w riegle jr 
dmich chairman of the senate banking committee 
wall street also will be watching the performance of the dollar 
in overseas trading and of the foreign stock exchanges especially 
tokyos which open before new york the performance of us 
companies such as international business machines corp that trade 
in london also could set the tone monday 
in hong kong on saturday the dollar closed slightly lower but 
not enough to provide any strong indications of foreign restiveness 
about the market drop 
gamsin said the new york stock exchange late friday and saturday 
reviewed all of the days trades and checked the financial status 
of its members firms and were very comfortable with the 
assessment 
a number of safeguards implemented following the 1987 crash 
would kick in monday should the market enter a free fall gamsin 
said 
if the dow drops 250 points from the previous days close all 
trading would be suspended for one hour a decline of 150 more 
points would trigger an additional twohour delay 
on friday stockindex futures trading was halted for 30 minutes 
twice on the chicago mercantile exchange when the markets in 
chicago had fallen 12 points on the standard amp poors 500 index 
equal to about 96 points on the dow

sen jesse helms of north carolina and gov 
bob martinez of florida both republicans are on a list of nine 
antiabortion politicians named saturday as the top targets for 
defeat next year by a national abortion rights group 
emboldened by its successes in congress and the florida 
legislature last week the national abortion rights action league 
announced its naral nine list and said it would be involved in 
hundreds of races from the senate to the state legislatures next 
year 
we will be in high profile campaigns to defeat these 
candidates said kate michelman executive director of the 
national proabortion group 
the naral nine and theyre just the top tier is where 
were going to concentrate our response this means a heavy 
investment she said 
michelman announced the list at a briefing for reporters before 
the groups national conference in washington over the weekend 
the list includes republican state legislators who have been 
particularly vocal and effective in leading antiabortion efforts 
in key states abortion opponents expected to seek higher office 
and two democrats the group has identified as opposing abortion 
rights 
one of the democrats is connecticut gov william a oneill 
that surprised connecticut abortion rights activists who said 
oneill does not pose a great threat to abortion rights they are 
urging naral to take oneill off the list 
we dont believe he belongs on our list with senator helms 
said lynn blackwell presient of the board of directors of narals 
connecticut affiliate he is not an active antichoice 
politician hes never used his power his considerable power to 
advance his personal opinion on abortion 
oneill was out of the country saturday but his spokesman jon 
sandberg called the listing bizarre 
sandberg noted that connecticut allows medicaid funding for 
abortions and said oneill has not supported failed attempts in 
the general assembly to cut off such funding 
a roman catholic oneill has long stated his personal 
opposition to abortion and voted against abortion rights as a 
state legislator in the 1970s but in nearly a decade as governor 
oneill has never pushed for restrictions on abortion 
on the list 
stephen freind a republican state representative in 
pennsylvania and leader of antiabortion forces there naral said 
he is sponsoring a bill that would ban abortion after the 24th week 
of pregnancy 
helms the threeterm republican senator from north carolina 
who has been an outspoken opponent of legalized abortions so far 
only one democrat a littleknown county prosecutor has announced 
as a candidate to oppose helms 
craig james a republican congressman from florida who 
narrowly defeated a veteran democrat in 1988 naral had already 
targeted him in advertising 
martinez the florida governor whose state legislature 
rejected all his proposals for restricting abortion in a special 
session he convened last week his likely opponents include 
democratic rep bill nelson who naral said has a record of 
opposing abortion rights 
tom miller iowas democratic attorney general and candidate 
for governor in 1990 miller is described as a staunch 
antiabortion advocate who faces several prochoice opponents in 
the democratic primary 
oneill the democratic governor of connecticut who faces 
several likely opponents 
kurt pringle republican state representative in california 
who won his first term narrowly in 1988 he is from orange county 
naral said californias legislative elections would be a special 
target because antiabortion forces have a narrow majority in the 
state assembly 
denny smith republican congressman from oregon who won 
narrowly in 1988 
tom tauke republican congressman from iowa who is an 
antiabortion candidate for the senate in 1990 opposing democratic 
sen tom harkins bid for a second term 
the group also is involved in the two 1989 races for governor in 
new jersey and virginia and on thursday began airing ads on 
virginia television stations attacking antiabortion republican 
candidate marshall coleman it was also running ads in more than a 
dozen sunday newspapers 
michelman said the group plans to work in 1990 party primary 
campaigns in an effort to defeat antiabortion candidates 
in iowa the group plans to run an independent expenditure 
campaign against miller in florida michelman said the group would 
reassess its involvement in the governors race if nelson becomes 
the democratic nominee and he does not embrace a prochoice 
position

nearly 500 antinuclear protesters many 
with their children in tow scaled fences around the seabrook 
nuclear power plant saturday and police waiting inside arrested 
them 
protesters brought ladders to help them over the 8foot fences 
that surround the plant once inside the plant the demonstrators 
sat down 
at the busiest of the six points where protesters climbed the 
fence at least 300 people went over including two confined to 
wheelchairs many children and at least one infant in a 
backpackcarrier 
officials estimated 600 to 700 activists took part in the rally 
police chief paul cronin said 475 people were arrested including 
469 charged with criminal trespass and six with disorderly conduct 
cronin said the six were accused of jumping in front of buses 
carrying protesters to the police station 
among the protesters were david hills 35 who brought his 
6yearold daughter dana 
the point of children coming along is that so many people 
want to hide their children from whats going on in the world he 
said 
asked why she came to the demonstration dana said because i 
didnt like seabrook asked why she said because people can 
die 
at a rally earlier molly yard president of the national 
organization for women drew cheers 
for the first time the national organization for women 
nationally is standing with a group working to end nuclear power in 
this country she said 
today we petition the powers that be heed the voice of the 
people of this country no nuclear power 
after yard spoke protesters marched to the 62 billion plant 
to post photographs of children on its fence the theme for the 
protest and others scheduled this week is for our childrens 
future and many demonstrators brought their children with them 
other events set for the coming week include a rally at the 
statehouse on sunday and concluding with a demonstration at 
president bushs home in kennebunkport next weekend 
saturdays rallies were sponsored by a group called the 
clamshell alliance a name that came from the groups concern that 
seabrooks cooling system might accidentally discharge into the 
surrounding ocean and harm shellfish on the new hampshire coast 
protests began at seabrook in 1976 when a lone demonstrator 
climbed a weather observation tower later that year 18 people 
were arrested as they tried occupy the muddy construction site 
since then in mostly peaceful demonstrations more than 3200 
arrests have been made 
in 1979 and 1980 a splinter group impatient with the 
nonviolent civil disobedience practiced by the clamshell alliance 
ducked behind plywood shields and attacked the plant fences with 
bolt cutters grappling hooks and ladders police and national 
guardsmen used riot sticks tear gas mace fire hoses and dogs to 
repel the attacks 
since then authorities have allowed demonstrators to climb 
fences before arresting them 
the plants foes oppose nuclear power as dangerous and 
expensive and argue that seabrook is not safe and that the 
congested beach tourist area around it could not be evacuated 
safely in case of an accident in the summer 
plant officials say seabrooks doubleshelled reactor dome makes 
it the safest plant around and argue that even if there were an 
accident emergency plans for communities within 10 miles of the 
plant are adequate to protect people 
seabrooks first reactor was completed in 1986 after its second 
reactor was canceled and mothballed while 25 percent finished it 
completed lowpower testing in june despite a valve problem that 
cut the test short the response of plant operators to the 
malfunction was criticized in state and federal reviews 
now 10 times over budget and 10 years behind schedule the plant 
remains idle as challenges to its evacuation planning hold up 
fullpower licensing

lebanons parliamentary deputies 
saturday narrowed their peace talks to the issue of syrias 
military presence but one military leader said christian deputies 
could be in trouble if they come home with a bad deal 
in a statement carried by christian radio stations in beirut 
lebanon christian gen michel aoun called on the deputies not to 
make any commitment that would be viewed as a concession on 
sovereignty 
the lebanese people will have no mercy on anyone who makes 
concessions no matter how important he is auon said 
the talks aimed at ending lebanons 14yearold civil war and 
revamping the nations government entered their third week in this 
mountain resort saturday 
lebanons christiandominated system of government was set up 
when the country gained independence from france in 1943 at that 
time christians were in the majority but now moslems make up 55 
percent of the population 
conference sources expressed optimism that the syrian question 
could be resolved if aoun accepts an arab league guarantee that the 
syrians will withdraw their 40000 troops from lebanon under a 
twoyear timetable 
the draft peace plan by arab league mediators envisages the 
phased withdrawal of syrian troops from metropolitan areas to the 
eastern bekaa valley 
the final pullout would be left vaguely tied to the end of the 
israeli military presence in the country and a strong central 
government in beirut that would sign a security pact with syria 
syrian troops are in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate however aoun says they have lost their 
mandate by openly siding with the moslems in the civil war 
the meeting of the 63 deputies started sept 30 the lawmakers 
have announced several times they were on the verge of a peace 
settlement only to be frustrated by renewed demands from one side 
or the other 
said one source they reach a consensus and then get a 
telephone call from beirut and we are back where we started 
prosyrian shiite moslem leader nabih berri and druze warlord 
walid jumblatt have upped the stakes from beirut each time aouns 
hardline maronite christians demanded a quicker syrian pullout and 
written guarantees from the syrian government in damascus 
the moslems have concentrated on the powersharing formula the 
arab mediators saudi arabia morocco and algeria have outlined 
as a charter for national reconciliation

chinas most prestigious university opened 
saturday for the first time since soldiers crushed the massive 
prodemocracy protests its students helped lead 
students gathered to buy books at the center of the beijing 
university campus near a long red banner that urged them to uphold 
marxist principles and take a clear stand against western 
capitalist values 
few were willing to talk about the protests that ended in 
gunfire and triggered a hardline backlash in which communist party 
general secretary zhao ziyang was ousted and thousands were 
arrested 
most students have become more realistic about the situation 
and now they want to study said one but they reported that 
among themselves and on other beijing campuses students have 
taken to sarcastically singing the jingle from a pesticide 
commercial that goes we are the harmful insects 
students were noticeably fewer than usual the 750member 
freshman class down from about 2100 last year will be absent 
all year to undergo military and political training at an army 
academy outside the capital their dormitories were empty 
authorities announced after the protests that freshmen for the 
first time would spend a year at a military academy but they 
insisted it was not punishment for the prodemocracy protests 
the reduction in the freshman class was part of a nationwide cut 
in firstyear students from about 640000 to 610000 
beijing university has been particularly hardhit partly 
because it is mainly a liberal arts school and liberal arts are 
losing the most new students the university played a leading role 
in the demonstrations but authorities claim the enrollment 
reductions had nothing to do with that 
the school has an enrollment of about 10000 but students said 
some upperclassmen failed to show up fearing investigations of 
their roles in the protests 
other colleges are still continuing such investigations two 
months after reopening with special teams pressuring teachers and 
students who were heavily involved to write fuller 
selfcriticisms or confessions 
an official notice posted in several places at beijing 
university said the government would be lenient toward those who 
turn themselves in confess or render meritorious service 
which it explained meant reporting the crimes of others or 
providing evidence 
other schools reopened early in august to complete the spring 
semesters unfinished work and hold special political ideology 
classes but beijing universitys opening was delayed until after 
the oct 1 anniversary of 40 years of communist party rule 
apparently for fear its students would disrupt the festivities the 
day passed peacefully 
the party newspaper the peoples daily said friday that 
beijing university was a major disaster zone during the 
protests 
it called for strengthening school management saying that 
people with bourgeois liberal or antisocialist views took 
advantage of its past free atmosphere 
bourgeois liberals will always try by hook or by crook to 
meddle in beijing university because of its tradition as chinas 
most prestigious school it warned 
but university president wu shuqing a marxist economist who 
replaced the relatively liberal ding shisun after the protests 
said in an interview last week that he was confident the students 
would be more healthy this year 
the university will help the students to understand how to 
advance the nations economic and political reforms according to 
chinas actual problems and sticking to a socialist orientation 
he said 
wu said the schools goal was to train students to be both red 
and expert 
beijing university traditionally has led other schools in 
political activism dating back to its leadership in the 1919 may 
fourth movement a studentled protest movement against german 
concessions 
although most students in beijing and other cities have 
predicted there will be no big protests this year there have 
already been individual acts of defiance one student at a 
technical college wrote down with premier li peng on a 
blackboard he was tracked down and arrested

six san francisco giants fans swam 12 
miles across san francisco bay to the opening game of the world 
series on saturday and were greeted with boos from followers of 
the oakland athletics 
swimmer tim callahan and his friends climbed out of the water 
near the oakland coliseum after swimming from the embarcaderos 
ferry building a trip that took four hours and 54 minutes 
callahan and his friends who also swam the english channel last 
summer got the idea from san francisco newspaper columnist herb 
caen who recently suggested that if a bay bridge world series 
developed it was inevitable that some wacky giants fans would 
stroke their way to candlestick park 
swimmer mike webb said the group from san franciscos dolphin 
club decided to do even better make a 12mile watery jaunt all 
the way across the bay 
the wind was a little cold he said we called the water 
warm a lot of people would call it freezing 
a couple of boats were on hand to take them back to safer 
friendlier territory all in all callahan said the experience was 
easy fun 
the series marks the first time since 1956 that two teams in the 
same metropolitan area have clashed in a world series and the 
meeting has been dubbed the bridge series for the span that 
connects the two cities

a man arrested by the fbi saturday for passing 
information to the soviets told the washington post he is a former 
marine and air force communications officer who tried to fool the 
kgb 
frank arnold nesbitt 44 was arrested at a hotel in suburban 
washington he was charged with communication and delivery and the 
attempt to communicate and deliver unauthorized information to 
agents of the soviet government the fbi said in a brief statement 
no other details were released 
but nesbitt in a lengthy interview with the washington post 
published in sundays editions said he did not tell soviet agents 
anything useful and informed the fbi of his dealings with the kgb 
soon after he left moscow earlier this year he said he wanted to 
be a double agent for the us government 
the post said nesbitt approached the paper friday because he was 
unhappy with the response he received from the fbi after he offered 
his services as a spy following a return from an 11day stay in 
moscow 
nesbitt was being held in the alexandria va adult detention 
center pending a preliminary hearing monday 
he told the newspaper he left his family and a computer job in 
memphis in june to go to central america where he wanted to buy 
small parcels of land the paper said nesbitts story could not be 
independently verified 
that didnt work out nesbitt told the paper so he went to 
guatemala city and then bolivia in august where he met a soviet 
official traveling with a russian ballet group 
the meeting which nesbitt said was purely happenstance 
ultimately led to nesbitts trip to moscow where he said the kgb 
tried to recruit him for espionage 
he said when he arrived in moscow he was paired with a kgb 
colonel who identified himself only as vladimir and kept in a 
safe house about two miles from the kremlin 
for most of his 11day stay nesbitt told the paper he and 
vladimir reviewed his experience in the us military and defense 
communications he said most of the information he provided to the 
soviets was at least 25 years old 
he said he was initially paid 2000 he said he gave the fbi 
1300 and showed the post an fbi receipt for it 
nesbitt said the soviets asked him to funnel nuclear weapons 
secrets out of the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico 
where he said he could have been helpful in locating what the 
soviets implied was an agent already operating at the facility 
nesbitt said he had a top secret clearance while serving as a 
communications officer in the air force from 1963 to 1966 and in 
the marines from 1969 to 1979 
while working at los alamos during 1983 and 1984 nesbitt said 
he held a nonclassified post until right before he left when he 
was given a top security clearance nesbitt who said he never had 
access to government secrets said he worked at los alamos less 
than a year and left after a personality conflict with a supervisor 
nesbitt said he contacted us authorities as soon as he arrived 
back in guatemala and fbi officials met his plane when he returned 
to washington oct 3 
nesbitt said he had been detained by the fbi at a washington 
hotel since oct 3 he said he left that hotel friday and went to 
the post to tell his story the hotel room where nesbitt was 
staying saturday when he was arrested was a room rented by a post 
reporter for the interview the newspaper said

congress and president bush are facing two 
impending budget struggles following senate passage of a 14 
billion deficitreduction bill that was stripped clean of billions 
of dollars of spending items and tax breaks 
the chambers 877 passage of the fiscal 1990 deficitcutting 
legislation late friday set the stage for what could be difficult 
negotiations between the senate and house on a compromise version 
of the bill 
unless bush signs the compromise into law by monday impossible 
because house members are away for the weekend 16 billion in 
defense and domestic spending cuts will take effect that day the 
fiscal year began oct 1 
the deal worked out between democratic and republican leaders 
also left the bill minus a capital gains tax cut that has been a 
priority for bush putting off that partisan showdown

refugees to leave for the west and has freed most prodemocracy 
demonstrators although communist leader erich honecker rejected

president bush says he still wants panamanian 
ruler manuel antonio noriega out of power but that doesnt mean 
hes giving a carte blanche for use of us military troops to 
help remove him 
bush continuing to defend his decision not to intervene in the 
failed coup attempt by panamanian military officers last week 
said i wouldnt mind using force if it could be done in a 
prudent manner 
but he said i hope i would never be reckless enough as a 
commander in chief to make a blanket commitment to use of force 
without knowing the facts regarding some coup attempt 
he called complaints that he should have used military power to 
back up his repeated calls for panamanians to oust noriega a 
stupid argument that some very erudite people make

preceded by herecomedejudge jokes and 
headlines about viewer juries cnns new the world today 
premieres tonight coanchored by bernard shaw and former texas 
judge catherine crier 
it will be a closely watched event its criers debut in news 
and it marks a direct cnn push if only in half the nation against 
the cbs evening news abcs world news tonight and nbc 
nightly news 
crier 34 had no experience at all as a journalist when hired 
by cable news network whose action startled many in news she only 
has had two weeks on the job at cnn shaw with cnn since it began 
in 1979 is a 25year veteran in news who came up the hard 
traditional way 
although he has declined to comment he reportedly was more than 
a little miffed at her hiring crier says she knows nothing of 
that thats not the message ive been receiving and ive been 
working with him 
she meant rehearsals of the new show crier who will coanchor 
it at cnn headquarters in atlanta with shaw coanchoring in 
washington is aware that a certain amount of criticism may follow 
her onair debut tonight 
im not as worried about that initial round as i will be six 
months or a year down the road if criticism continues she says 
because i am brand new to the business and i acknowledge that 
and have a lot to learn 
she doubtless will be the nations most watched onthejob 
trainee but cnns new onehour weeknight newscast starting at 6 
pm edt isnt likely to make a big dent in ratings of the big 
three for several reasons 
the major networks twice feed their halfhour weeknight 
newscasts to affiliates the first feed at 630 pm edt west 
coast affiliates air those newscasts three hours later on a 
tapedelay basis 
in contrast the world today will air live simultaneously in 
all time zones with no tape delays for the west coast thus its 
headon competition with the big three only will be in eastern and 
central time zones 
its potential audience also is smaller because only it only is 
on cable cnn estimates it is seen in 52 million homes thats 
impressive but there are a total of 921 million homes with tv 
according to ac nielsen co figures 
ed turner cnns executive vice president for newsgathering 
downplays the idea of the newcomer representing major competition 
to the big three 
in the cable world i dont know that you say youre going to 
make a dent in nielsen numbers he says you hope to but you 
look for the kind of audience thats most desirable to sponsors 
some of the bettereducated more affluent viewers and we have 
a pretty good market for that 
nbc news anchor tom brokaw referring to shares of audience for 
programs says that the new cnn rival is just one more 
demonstration that every year that pie out there is getting sliced 
into that many more pieces 
but he says hes not certain whether the world today is a 
potential ratings threat to his newscast and those of cbs and abc 
he admires both cnn and shaw i dont know anything about 
that woman he adds referring to crier but my impression 
always is that cnns greatest strengths always have been as a kind 
of random viewing place he says 
i dont know if people look for specific programs there i 
guess that cnns new newscast will be the test for them 
and for us as well

nbc continuing its recent tradition of uplifting entertainment 
tonight airs another steamy tale of tawdry it is roxanne the 
prize pulitzer which is set amid the rich in palm beach fla 
and lasts for two hours 
based on the book of the same name by roxanne pulitzer it 
dramatizes her sad story how her fairytale romance with and 
marriage to publishing heir herbert pulitzer collapsed amid a 
flurry of headlines about cocaine trumpets and sexual capers that 
included one menageatrois 
what to say of this movie first it is only her version of what 
happened the latter noted on the screen at the end no doubt for 
legal reasons it is lushly filmed and roxanne mainly is depicted 
as an innocent vulnerable misused waif 
but chynna phillips is very very good as poor poor roxanne 
one wishes she had a better script one also wishes that perry 
king given a onedimensional part as the man who married the fair 
young roxanne had hair color that stayed the same 
although only a passage of several years is involved here his 
locks are mostly silver in some scenes in other scenes the heirs 
hair is mostly dark brown with a dab of gray 
this drama may raise anew the debate over colorization but it 
is one that can be missed with no regrets

the news stunned some stock analysts who had 
aniticipated earnings of about 50 million for the quarter too 
high suggested a chrysler executive i doubt we did much better 
than break even 
there could very well be more shocks of that sort in coming 
months since the stock market has tended to ignore a deterioration 
of corporate earnings that began early in the second quarter of the 
year 
the longer term trend is there to be examined but many 
investors appear to ignore it meanwhile their sense of wellbeing 
is secured by reports from many companies showing that in spite of 
a sluggish economy they are doing well 
on the day robert miller jr chrysler chief financial officer 
estimated negatively on his companys thirdquarter earnings 
cocacola reported a 209 percent earnings surge and general 
electric a jump of 16 percent 
glittering reports of that sort especially from two of 
americas premier companies are bound to attract the attention of 
those who pray for a rising market but they also obscure the 
condition of the majority of corporations 
for the latter earnings have lost a lot of momentum in 1988 
profits of companies in the standard amp poors composite index rose 
36 percent the rate fell to 22 percent over the prior year in 
the first quarter of 1989 in the second quarter the 
yearoveryear rise declined to under 5 percent 
those rates still leave corporate america making a profit but 
the trend is clear it is especially clear in certain categories 
such as aerospace apparel automotive electronics metals 
oilgas and recreation 
and some wellknown companies suffered not just declines in the 
upward progress of their profits but actual losses in 
electronics for example wang reported a loss of 375 million and 
control data a loss of 497 million 
such numbers usually are sufficient to call investor attention 
to a problem and they have but the concern seems limited to the 
specific companies more than to the industry and to the industry 
rather than to the whole market 
the stock market is believed by many to be a good economic 
forecaster the premise being that investors arent inclined to 
needlessly risk their capital and so wouldnt be investing if the 
next six months or so didnt look good 
true you can find few forecasters with arguments that support a 
sizable downturn in the economy but there also are few who foresee 
a big increase over 1989 there are many who believe gains in 
corporate profits will be small 
drimcgrawhill whose economic projections are used by many 
companies expects aftertax profits to be down sharply in the 
first two quarters based on comparisons with the same quarters a 
year earlier 
thereafter it expects an upward trend right through 1991 but 
not until the second quarter of that year 18 months from now 
does it foresee the level of profits achieved early this year 
as the stock market plays tag with new highs therefore the 
pressing question it presents for your consideration is this is it 
looking six months ahead or perhaps two years or is it perhaps 
confused

they starred in the 70s and stumbled in the 
80s now wall street seems to be warming up again toward energy 
stocks as the 1990s approach 
the oil industrys long dry spell appears to be ending 
declares the merrill lynch market letter in its current issue 
we think it is giving way to an uptrend that will see all the 
major facets of the business exploration and production 
activities as well as refining and marketing operations do well 
simultaneously in the years ahead 
at another large investment firm dean witter reynolds analyst 
john connolly says at long last energy fundamentals look decent 
we now believe this group can significantly influence the success 
or failure of a portfolio 
connolly like many another marketwatcher had been 
recommending that investment managers keep their energy holdings 
well below the proportionate weight the group carries in the 
popular indexes of stock prices 
now he says we have canceled our deep underweighting and 
opted for the first time in years for a slightly overweighted 
position 
even the most ardent energy bulls dont expect investors 
suddenly to rush into a sector of the market that has produced so 
many disappointments for so long 
but they do foresee at least a gradual recognition of what they 
describe as brightening prospects for both energy demand and energy 
prices 
the demand for oil has increased since 1985 and now is more 
than 51 million barrels a day a level last seen 10 years ago 
merrill lynch says 
we think demand will increase at an average annual rate of 1 
million barrels a day over the next few years and that prices will 
trend higher especially if supplies from countries that are not 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries begin 
to decline 
ah yes opec the powerful cartel that was supposed to keep 
pushing oil prices higher and higher for the indefinite future 
after the energy shocks of the 1970s in the industrialized world 
when market conditions got tough it turned out there were some 
deep cracks behind that groups supposedly united front 
but now connolly argues opecs leading members have maneuvered 
themselves into a position where only a few of them need to 
practice restraint in their production policies to tip the balance 
of supply and demand in their favor 
furthermore he adds the most significant development in the 
next few years will be a pronounced output decline by the worlds 
largest producer the soviet union 
along with improving business conditions analysts say might 
come revived takeover interest in energy companies says merrill 
lynch higher valuations for refining and marketing facilities 
have boosted the asset values of many oil companies 
despite all such arguments many skeptics remain investors 
trying to spot a rebound in the oil industrys fortunes have been 
frustrated repeatedly since the mid1980s 
in his report on the subject connolly says he was not an easy 
convert to the cause 
we have hesitated to commit to the energy area all year he 
says in fact we have hesitated for several years now proving 
that he who hesitates is not always lost

the siberian villager led an american 
interviewer into his home and safely out of view of his neighbors 
started talking about freedom in the altai mountains far from 
moscow 
this is the only place in the whole world where a person can 
feel himself being free can feel himself being original to be 
himself to be his own person he said in russian that is the 
altai spirit and that is what im proud of 
but soviet authorities like the invading armies that have swept 
through southern siberia since the 8th century bc now are 
encroaching upon his lifestyle electricity a day care facility 
television 
that revealing bit of glasnost openness appears near the end 
of hard labor in siberia a documentary that premieres monday 
on the discovery channel it was one of many unexpected events an 
american riverrunning team encountered in siberia in august 1988 
that did surprise us the programs writerdirector john 
armstrong recalled in a recent interview the altai villager 
armstrong said had been reluctant to speak initially for fear his 
neighbors would think he was an informant then he opened up on his 
government 
he was saying we are the freest people in the world we have 
the freest spirit and hes proud of it and he doesnt like the 
soviet union he doesnt like them coming in and meddling 
armstrong said 
the villager also had his own views about america 
he just cracked us up when he said this is the miami of the 
soviet union to him miami meant freedom armstrong added 
despite its title there are no soviet gulags in hard labor in 
siberia the labor was in navigating the bashkaus river an angry 
ribbon of water that surges through the altai mountains 
the film documents the first attempt by a western group to 
traverse the bashkaus said to be one of the toughest stretches of 
whitewater in the world 
as an adventure film hard labor in siberia packs a wallop 
but armstrong clearly is interested in more than just man against 
nature he also pits the western notion of lockstep communist 
states against the reality of the independent altai people and the 
three outspoken soviet river runners who led the trip 
they were just like us just in terms of the way they 
related armstrong said of the soviet boaters they could care 
less about what their government was saying in fact they were 
even suspicious of soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
armstrong said 
the film is a constant clash of opposites frenzied water 
bashing immovable rocks bigcity soviets confronting agrarian 
siberians hightech us equipment vs lowtech but inventive 
soviet hardware and can do americans challenged by cautious 
russian bureaucrats 
the expedition began badly the soviet organizers 
sovintersport were unsure of the abilities of their western 
visitors and suddenly decided they should do a less dangerous river 
but once sovintersport authorities were out of sight the 
americans persuaded their soviet guides that they were capable of 
tackling the bashkaus 
the soviets arent geared up for tourists running their rivers 
in the first place armstrong said they thought the bashkaus 
would be too dangerous they didnt know what we were capable of 
handling and they didnt want any bodies on their hands 
a soviet river runner had died on the bashkaus just a few days 
earlier bringing the death count to seven since the river first 
was run in 1977 
an american raft nearly sank when it became wedged in rocks and 
the american kayakers often looked to be in danger of being 
swallowed by heartstopping vortices of water 
the soviets were adept with their catamaranlike boats that had 
two inflated canvas pontoons joined by tubing and birchbark straps 
the soviets balanced astride the pontoons broncbusting style 
a final surprise awaited the expedition at the end of their 
journey a soviet film crew was in the altai village shooting a 
gold robbery western based on a jack london short story 
and even in this remote corner of the world the soviet film 
makers traveled in style with a sauna

one recent night liza minnelli and her husband 
sculptor mark gero went out to dinner with a friend when they got 
home the friend telephoned with a question for the singer 
have you ever had a hit record asked gene simmons formerly 
of kiss 
no came minnellis response 
people think she has minnelli says but new york new york 
was a hit for frank sinatra and cabaret was a hit for louis 
armstrong it was way before i did the movie i was doing 
charlie bubbles at the time the first movie i did with albert 
finney 
simmons who obviously didnt phone just to flatter continued 
how did you get so far in your career without a hit record 
hard work going around singing and building an audience and 
its 130 in the morning you got something in mind 
simmons did he thought she should sing today music and he 
should represent minnelli in her recording career which he now 
does he introduced her to cbs records president walter yetnikoff 
who signed her to epic records the pet shop boys manager happened 
to see the signing memo and suggested they produce a couple of 
tracks on her album a meeting was arranged 
so while singers from linda ronstadt to steve miller switch on 
albums from rock to standard ballads minnelli is going the other 
way and trying out rock results is her first album in 12 years 
that isnt a broadway cast album or a live concert 
she had heard west end girls by the pet shop boys i 
started to buy their albums the song that hooked me was rent it 
was this strange beautiful little song so bittersweet and ironic 
it was almost like a noel coward lyric 
the first song the pet shop boys chris lowe and neil tennant 
brought to her she recalled in a recent interview was losing my 
mind from stephen sondheims score for follies as they 
worked on recording it they found out minnelli knew more about 
rock than theyd expected and she discovered they knew a lot about 
the rodgers and hart era 
they found out i wasnt going to try and pretend like i knew 
more than i do or boss them around or be demanding she said 
all i wanted was to do it well and learn from them because i 
adore them four days later they called and said we want to do 
the whole album the pet shop boys wrote seven of the 10 songs 
i kept saying i want to do your music they said youve 
got to leave us open if we find something thats good for you i 
said its up to you completely 
theres a dance beat which minnelli calls heartbeats on 
the tune 
i sing it with anger she said its different from 
singing it as blues but just as valid obsession runs many courses 
and a lot of layers after you get sad and sorry for yourself you 
probably get angry i do 
losing my mind already is a hit in europe shed been busy 
with concerts broadway tv and films and hadnt been yearning for 
a hit record but when the album shipped gold in england i was 
like the new artist of the week it was hilarious it was 
wonderful the album was released in the united states on tuesday 
the pet shop boys didnt want minnelli to change her emotive 
singing style and stopped her once for a retake when she pronounced 
love luv as she thought a rock singer should 
i had such fun working with them minnelli said just the 
three of us in this little tiny recording studio they cut the 
album with minnelli singing eight songs to completed tracks 
rent and tonight is forever were cut live with strings 
its the first time theyd done that they were so amazed the 
musicians play i sing and we go to dinner 
they worked 10 days four more sessions were done later while 
she was in london during her fourmonth tour with frank sinatra and 
sammy davis jr 
wed sing in royal albert hall and id come off stage and say 
bye guys im going across town and work with the pet shop boys 
some nights they went along and listened 
i was going between two different styles of music what it 
showed me the most is how alike they are she said 
as a dancer and somebody who moves to music the pet shop 
boys tracks are so interesting on top of that you have this 
almost floating almost gregorian melody and very poetic words im 
passionate about lyrics 
dont drop bombs which is a story about a relationship not 
a war will be the second single and so sorry i said about a 
woman who realizes she shouldnt be so selfdeprecating will be 
the third 
twist in my sobriety isnt about drinking a girl is 
talking to a guy saying youre a little left turn in my 
straightahead life and thats all you can be dont get too 
serious 
tanita tikaram wrote it and performed it almost like a 
folksong we do the psychotic version of it minnelli said 
we were listening to the playback and chris said wouldnt it 
be funny if we said liza with a z on this like a rap neil said 
that should be heard half the people who buy this record wont 
have heard that i was amazed that they knew it they were 
referring to minnellis 1971 tv special liza with a z 
in her only reference to mastering substance abuse minnelli 
cheerfully said she doesnt know what her next showbiz project 
will be i dont know and i love it it kind of goes with my 
onedayatatime life

dustin hoffmans shylock on the london stage is 
now a memory leaving a legacy of mixed reviews packed houses and 
great expectations for broadway where he opens in december 
sir peter halls production of shakespeares the merchant of 
venice was the lone smash hit in an otherwise lackluster summer 
for british drama it opened june 1 at the phoenix theater for a 
13week run that was extended through sept 23 
hoffman as shylock was a risky venture it wasnt just a 
question of ironing the new york inflections out of hoffmans 
voice but of how the fastidious british theatergoing public would 
take to a hollywood star attempting shakespeare 
i didnt quite know what it would be like all i knew is i 
would learn something hoffman said 
explaining the mixed reviews he blamed the speed with which the 
production was rushed onto the stage due to his fathers illness 
which forced him to spend time at his bedside in the united states 
we opened in this play after 10 public performances and my 
performance for me was like those incisions you see from people 
whove been operated on he said in an august interview 
you still see their fresh wounds and their stitches now im 
at a point where you can barely see the scars 
shylock is the jewish moneylender whose thirst for revenge 
against antonio leigh lawson the venetian merchant of the title 
finds its match in the exactingly legalistic heiress portia 
geraldine james 
hall who directed the play said that as an authentically 
jewish actor hoffman changed the part historically 
merchant seemed to me particularly right for him hall 
said in an interview shylock is about the outsider the man 
coming into the society which he is foreign to which was very much 
dustins situation coming into an english theater company 
assessing hoffmans achievement toward the end of the london 
run hall said shylock is wheeling and dealing and surviving 
and thats what dustin seizes hold of to me he answers the 
question is shylock comic or tragic by saying hes both hes a 
man 
the shylock character traditionally provokes the accusation that 
shakespeare was antisemitic and anyone involved in staging the 
merchant of venice knows how sensitively it must be handled 
to have a jewish actor play shylock is mandatory in our age 
said hall if youre going to talk about jewishness youd better 
do it from a position of integrity and knowledge not ham acting 
some of the plays success may have been due to renewed 
enthusiasm for shakespeare but the real draw undoubtedly was 
hoffman fresh from his second academy award for rain man in a 
play that marked both his british and his shakespearean stage debut 
hoffman who grew a beard for the show and shaved it off after 
the last performance eschewed abovethetitle billing and appeared 
half way down the cast list 
but despite such modesty the mixed reviews and a top ticket 
price of 1750 pounds 28 expensive by london standards the 
play quickly sold out only the london megamusicals such as 
phantom of the opera and aspects of love sold as many 
tickets 
the play starts new york performances dec 4 at the 46th st 
theater with an opening on dec 19 
hall recalled that hoffman first thought of playing hamlet but 
was judged too old at 52 malvolio in twelfth night another 
possibility was shelved for want of a suitable viola the two then 
hit on shylock one of shakespeares most controversial parts and 
also surprisingly small in light of its importance shylock appears 
in only five scenes 
a planned outoftown tryout in bath was canceled because of 
hoffmans fathers illness and hoffmans performance had to evolve 
during the run the opening said costar geraldine james was 
very rushed 
dustin hit his peak in the middle of the run she said in an 
interview he hadnt got the confidence at the beginning and 
i think he might have gone too much the other way towards the 
end playing too much into the audience 
she said she found his attitude anything but starry he was so 
generous spiritually and literally he wouldnt have his name over 
the title and insisted on me having the last curtain call 
julia wilsondickson the productions dialogue coach admired 
hoffman as a fanatical worker a seeker after the truth but 
perhaps a little more free in his enthusiasm than most british 
actors 
it fell to her to turn his dawg into dog and bawnd 
into bond and his performance over time got simpler more 
straightforward and physically stronger vocally she said in an 
interview 
the actual conception of it is exactly the same but the 
practical delivery has been honed greatly 
could hoffman tackle other shakespeare parts absolutely 
wilsondickson said ive told him so about 50 times and hes 
definitely humble enough to ask

democrat l douglas wilder forced a frown 
and gave his audience of college students a parody of the questions 
he and republican j marshall coleman have heard dozens of times in 
their campaign for governor 
can it really be taking place here in virginia wilder 
asked his voice mocking the astonished tones of an outsider are 
they really going to do that there what sort of poison have they 
poured in the water down there what are those people drinking 
wilder the states 58yearold lieutenant governor and 
coleman a 47yearold former attorney general are deadlocked in 
polls on the states most expensive battle for governor 20 
million and growing 
if wilder wins on nov 7 he would become the first black 
elected governor of any state 
yet strikingly in a campaign that has captured national 
attention because a black man is vying for the top office in the 
flagship of the confederacy both candidates have avoided more than 
passing mention of race the chief issues have been abortion and 
crime 
nonetheless race has had a major impact on the campaign says 
larry sabato a university of virginia government professor its 
just been the opposite of what was expected 
clearly wilders race is a net plus for him sabato said 
it gets him loads of free and favorable national publicity it 
produces national money it insulates him from many charges 
and its a status symbol for upper and middleclass suburban 
whites to vote for him its objective proof that theyre not 
racist the professor said 
coleman says virginians see the contest just as two candidates 
running for office standing in the shadows of the blue ridge 
mountains where he spent his youth he said wilder wants to take 
the state back to the days of higher taxes high interest rates 
and high inflation 
wilder also portrays coleman as a turn the clock back 
candidate who wants to return to the time when abortions were 
illegal and progress was measured by the bulldozers of bigmoney 
real estate developers 
to get where they are both candidates have beaten the odds 
wilder became virginias first black statewide officeholder and 
the highestranking elected state official of his race in the 
country when he won the no 2 office in 1985 that was after 16 
years in the virginia senate where he was the first black since 
reconstruction 
coleman was the only republican to become attorney general this 
century and when he won the post in 1977 at age 34 its youngest 
occupant ever after he lost the 1981 race for governor to democrat 
charles s robb coleman was written off by his party but he 
scored a comeback by winning the states first gop gubernatorial 
primary in 40 years 
the current governor democrat gerald l baliles is barred by 
the state constitution from seeking a second consecutive term 
a richmond timesdispatch poll published oct 1 found 42 percent 
for wilder and 40 percent for coleman with the remainder 
undecided the polls margin of error was four percentage points 
either way 
partly because of the primary the campaign has passed 20 
million in fundraising coleman has pulled in 82 million more 
than a third of it from real estate developers in fastgrowing 
northern virginia a point that wilder has used against him to 
wilders 48 million but coleman spent much of his war chest in 
the primary as of oct 1 wilder had 16 million in the bank to 
colemans 925000 
wilder who is expected to get nearly all of the approximately 
17 percent black vote in the state has tried hard not to alienate 
moderate whites who gave democrats the top state offices in the 
last two elections while voting solidly for republicans ronald 
reagan and george bush 
when a labor day college fraternity gathering of 100000 black 
youths in virginia beach erupted into riots he refused to join 
other black leaders who accused the resort citys leaders of being 
hostile to minority visitors 
coleman has said he will not concede the black vote and will not 
let wilder use race as a shield to hide behind what coleman calls a 
liberal voting record 
wilder has made colemans antiabortion views the focus of a 
television ad and has pressed the gop contender on whether he would 
sign legislation restricting abortions he also says coleman whose 
support from evangelical conservatives helped him win the primary 
would make abortion a litmus test for appointees a charge coleman 
denies 
he has been seeking to exploit a very emotional issue and to 
distort my record coleman said in a televised debate last week 
i think that issue now should be put to rest 
last week coleman countered with his own tv commercial 
depicting wilder as insensitive to women for having introduced a 
bill in 1972 that would have allowed defense attorneys to 
interrogate rape victims 13 and under about their sex lives wilder 
press secretary laura f dillard said wilder submitted the bill for 
a constituent and did not support it or vote for it 
coleman has tried to make wilder appear soft on crime by 
resurrecting a 12yearold vote against a cop killer death 
penalty bill the republican has also played up his endorsement by 
the states fraternal order of police an endorsement wilder won in 
1985 wilder said he supports virginias capital punishment law 
the only black governor in us history was pinckney bs 
pinchback of louisiana he became lieutenant governor in 1871 and 
moved up to the post of acting governor for six weeks in 18721873 
after the governor was impeached 
in recent years major parties have nominated two black 
politicans for governorships in 1982 and 1986 los angeles mayor 
thomas bradley ran as californias democratic candidate for 
governor losing both times to republican george deukmejian in 
1986 michigan republican william lucas failed to unseat democratic 
gov james j blanchard
