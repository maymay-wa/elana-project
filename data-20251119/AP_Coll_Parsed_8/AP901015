amnesty international said wednesday it was 
concerned about reports that thousands of political detainees were 
held without charge in egyptian prisons and were often tortured 
the human rights organization said 8000 opponents of president 
hosni mubaraks government were reportedly detained in 1989 and 
detentions although fewer were continuing this year 
anyone can effectively be held for months without charge or 
trial if the interior ministry says they are a threat to national 
security amnesty reported from its headquarters in london 
ali rahmy press counselor at the egyptian embassy in london 
called the report completely false 
amnesty attacked emergency laws that let the government hold 
people without trial or charge for many months or even years 
in some cases family members were rounded up to force them to 
divulge a wanted persons whereabouts it said 
amnesty expressed concern that some hearings took place this 
year without detainees being in court making it impossible for the 
court to know of any complaints of torture or illtreatment 
egypt signed the 1986 united nations convention against torture 
and so must investigate such complaints of torture but amnesty 
said it failed to do so 
the evidence of torture in egypt has been increasing and yet 
there has so far been little sign of a response from the egyptian 
authorities to indicate an official resolve to tackle or eradicate 
the problem amnesty said 
more systematic torture including use of electric shocks to 
the genitals and other sensitive parts of the body and suspension 
by the wrists from barred windows or from doors has been reported 
in dozens of cases including many from 1989 
among cases of political prisoners it says were tortured in 
detention amnesty cited ali assayyed batikh a surgeon arrested 
on sept 23 1989 
ali batikh was himself beaten and threatened with electricity 
and sexual attacks while being asked questions about his alleged 
activities for the moslem brotherhood in the giza area the 
organization said 
the brotherhood is a banned organization of islamic 
fundamentalists it was the fundamentalists who assassinated 
president anwar sadat in october 1981 
amnesty said most victims have been members and sympathizers 
of islamic groups 
of egypts 49 million people 90 percent are moslem the rest of 
the population is mostly coptic orthodox christian 
the rights group said it presented its findings to egypt in 
february and talked with government officials last may but got no 
response to its requests for comment 
amnesty said the newly appointed interior minister and the 
prosecutor general assured amnesty specific cases would be 
investigated but the organization received no information 
investigations took place

the third game of the world chess showdown was 
adjourned monday night after five hours with neither world 
champion garry kasparov or challenger anatoly karpov clearly in 
control 
the first game was a draw and kasparov won the second game 
play was halted just after 1030 pm when kasparov wrote down 
his 41st move and sealed it in an envelope the game was set to 
resume tuesday at 530 pm when the match arbiter will open the 
envelope 
spectators said the players were in an unclear position 
there are chances for both sides and i predict a draw said 
dmitri gurevich a grand master from chicago 
i think the position is better for black kasparov but white 
karpov has good chances of surviving and getting a draw said 
international master vitaly zaltsman of brooklyn 
in the adjourned position white has a king rook bishop 
knight and four pawns black has a king two bishops a knight and 
five pawns 
the adjourned position is a complete mess nobody knows whats 
happening said joel benjamin a grand master from manhattan 
kasparov 27 the highestrated player in the history of chess 
leads 1 points to points in the 24game title match against 
karpov 39 the former world champion he unseated in 1985 
karpov played with the white pieces in game 3 which originally 
was to be played friday observers said they werent surprised when 
karpov an introverted methodical player postponed it until 
monday confidence is an important factor in this game of 
psychological warfare 
the archrivals have played more than 120 games with each other 
the majority of them like game 1 of this match were draws 
kasparov dominated game 2 thoroughly 
in the third game kasparov playing the black pieces repeated 
his choice of opening from the first game the kings indian 
defense but karpov with his fifth and sixth moves adopted a 
different system known as the classical variation 
karpov used 1 hours to play his first 15 moves kasparov used 
21 minutes for his first 14 moves then thought 41 minutes about 
move 15 a quiet knight retreat 
karpov then decided to accept kasparovs offer of the queen 
but kasparovs 23rd move trapped karpovs queen and forced an 
endgame in which karpov had an extra rook but kasparov had an extra 
bishop and two pawns that appeared very dangerous 
former soviet dissident nathan sharansky who is regarded as a 
strong amateur player was in the press room analyzing the third 
game

injections of the powerful toxin that causes 
botulism eased disabling tremors that failed to respond to standard 
drugs researchers report 
when injected into the muscles causing head or hand tremors the 
food poisoning toxin caused improvements for an average of three 
months patients generally responded equally well to followup 
treatment a researcher said 
twothirds of 51 patients showed improvement that helped them 
feed themselves improved their handwriting and reduced their 
embarrassment in public aaid dr joseph jankovic hand tremors 
were eliminated in seven cases he said 
jankovic a neurology professor at the baylor college of 
medicine in houston and director of is parkinsons disease center 
and movement disorders clinic did the study with colleague kenneth 
schwartz he reported the results monday at the annual meeting of 
the american neurological association in atlanta 
the toxin called botulinum toxin is produced by bacteria and 
is the most potent nervetargeting poison known when swallowed 
with food it causes lifethreatening botulism 
the toxin blocks messages from nerves to muscles so researchers 
use it to paralyze or weaken selected muscles the effect wears off 
because the toxin dissipates 
treated patients do not get botulism because the toxin 
concentrates in the muscle sites where it is injected and only 
small amounts are used 
botulinum toxin was approved by federal regulators in december 
for treating strabismus in which eyes are crossed or otherwise 
misaligned and blepharospasm which forces the eyelids to close 
scientists say it can also treat spasmodic torticollis a neck 
muscle disorder that turns or tilts the head a form of spasmodic 
dysphonia in which the vocal cords close too tightly and some 
other conditions 
the new study looks like very very promising research said 
botulinum toxin expert dr mitchell brin assistant professor of 
clinical neurology at the columbia university college of physicians 
and surgeons in new york 
schwartz said thousands of people might eventually be helped by 
the treatment 
tremors can be caused by a variety of conditions jankovic 
stressed that they are not a normal part of aging tremor at any 
age from infancy to 120 years of age is always abnormal he 
said 
the new work focused on people with tremors severe enough to 
interfere with their jobs and everyday tasks or cause unacceptable 
embarrassment 
each treatment involved three to five injections into the 
affected muscle fortytwo patients received injections to the neck 
for head tremors and 10 were treated in the forearm for hand 
tremors one patient received injections in both sites 
on average the toxin took effect about a week later and 
produced improvement for an average of 12 weeks 
there were a few relatively mild side effects that lasted up to 
about three weeks 
twelve patients who received neck injections reported difficulty 
swallowing four patients had neck weakness and six patients 
treated for hand tremor reported hand weakness jankovic said 
still almost all patients said they would rather have the 
temporary weakness than the tremor he said 
brin said the rate of side effects appeared to be high but that 
it was probably related to dosages used rather than an inherent 
drawback of toxin treatment jankovic and schwartz said the side 
effects should decrease as researchers learn more about dosages and 
injection sites 
jankovic said an average treatment might cost about 500 to 
1200

the us budget crisis which has big economic 
implications on this side of the atlantic is causing some concern 
among european commentators 
sometimes laughable often deplorable is how the french 
newspaper le monde viewed the us budgetary process 
the 250 billion deficit pushes up worldwide interest rates 
consumes capital and has undermined confidence in the dollar 
economists say 
in a front page editorial the moderate le monde criticized 
the disparity between the deficits global stakes and the 
shopkeepers haggling in washington 
a commentary in the netherlands largest daily the conservative 
de telegraaf compared the united states to an ancient empire in 
collapse 
the greeks couldnt hold out the romans couldnt keep their 
heads above water the united states is already degenerating 
nicely it said 
european government officials have said little publicly about 
the issue european monetary union and german unification have been 
more pressing political topics 
europes budgetmaking process generally is a more orderly and 
lowkey affair than in the united states britain boasted a 156 
billion budget surplus last year 
for years the united states trading partners have been 
pressuring the worlds richest nation to cut its deficit because it 
pushes us interest rates higher which in turn pushes up 
international interest rates 
higher interest rates slow economic growth 
the impasse could hamper the us federal reserve boards 
ability to lower interest rates which would increase chances of a 
recession in the united states next year analysts say that could 
hurt foreign economies because many are dependent on us demand 
the united states continues to finance a big portion of its 
deficit with foreign capital at a time when world demand for 
capital has been increased by german unification and the rebuilding 
of eastern europe analysts say that also puts upward pressure on 
interest rates 
the impasse has created uncertainty which the financial markets 
hate and has undermined confidence in the dollar which has fallen 
sharply in recent weeks 
stronger european currencies can hurt european exports by making 
them more expensive 
the czechoslovak state press agency ctk has warned that 
czechoslovakias effort to win status as a favored trading nation 
in washington could be a victim of the budget crisis 
if congress fails to approve a plan before midnight friday the 
federal government might shut down for a second time this month 
when congress refused to pass the first deficit plan for the 
fiscal year that began oct 1 president bush closed the government 
for the threeday columbus day weekend 
tourists being turned away from the statue of liberty and other 
national monuments made a big splash on british and spanish tv 
coverage 
some commentators however were heartened by a change in us 
attitudes toward the deficit 
romes la repubblica a liberal newspaper said the real new 
event is that the electors are shrugging off the apathy which has 
inserted itself in the past 10 years 
us voters are losing patience said germanys leftleaning 
frankfurther rundschau if congess fails the us 
congressional elections on nov 6 will bring many surprises 
but the us crisis has led some europeans to question bushs 
administration and the american political system 
geoffrey dennis an economist at the london investment firm 
james capel and co said it creates great concern about the 
leadership of the united states 
the leading spanish daily the leftofcenter el pais noted 
serious political problems highlighted by the budget crisis 
these include a lack of party discipline the absence of 
programs which can attract sufficient support the presidents 
vulnerability to political circumstance and the influence of 
pressure groups on congress it said 
the economist magazine had some practical suggestions for the 
united states one was that congressmens pay could be linked to 
the size of the deficit in the previous year the bigger the 
deficit the lower their pay

britains fashion industry has finally bestowed 
its top accolade on vivienne westwood the innovative and often 
outrageous designer who created the punk look for the sex pistols 
and triggered a worldwide craze 
after years of being passed over by the fashion establishment 
the 48yearold woman with the everyouthful eye was named designer 
of the year monday night at a starstudded charity gala at the 
royal albert hall 
the duchess of kent presented the award to ms westwood who 
said she was very thrilled for herself as well as her staff 
after all this time they had been getting very disillusioned and 
this award is an honor for us all 
always controversial and unorthodox ms westwood said on a 
british broadcasting corp radio program earlier in the day that 
the news media consistently used three adjectives to describe her 
clothes crazy sexy and unwearable 
she maintains her styles are commercial and defends everything 
she has created in her career of more than 15 years though she 
acknowledged in an interview in sky televisions magazine this 
month that some of her clothing was ridiculous and verging on 
the porno 
her cut slash and pull collection for next spring and 
summer unveiled on saturday featured very demure 40sstyle tailored 
suits with midi skirts in light grey and dusty pink alongside 
shocking bikinis and shorts embellished with bowtied satin phallic 
symbols 
ms westwoods latest experiment slashing and ripping thick 
denim and fine lycra into patterns on leggings shorts and dresses 
sometimes created fascinating designs but sometimes seemed to 
collapse 
dubbed the queen of fashion philosophers by the daily telegraph 
she told the bbc theres always a polemic in my clothes i try to 
fill the role of civilizing human beings and the first thing they 
have to do is question whats done 
ms westwood who described herself in the sky interview as 
antichristian and antiamerican culture said she was politicized 
by the hippie movement in the late 60s 
with her partner at the time malcolm maclaren she created punk 
as a reaction incorporating anarchy into fashion first for punk 
rocks sex pistols she also designed for pop stars boy george and 
bananarama 
i believed at that time youth had the potential to question 
the establishment she told the bbc im proud of it punk 
but i dont think its important any more i dont think youth 
has that role 
while punk made her name ms westwood has done collections on 
many other themes including witches pirates paganism 
romanticism rock n roll and space travel 
the designer of the year award was the top accolade among the 
british fashion awards which climaxed three days of catwalk shows 
unveiling the british spring and summer collections 
british designers took the best of the 60s and gave it a modern 
90s look for spring and summer the key words are short simple 
sexy and snappy 
cropped jackets and shorts are hot favorites but the big news 
is that dresses are back especially those skimpy shifts loved by 
jacqueline kennedy onassis and audrey hepburn 
white is right but so are summer pastels a little black and 
navy some vivid tropical hues and a smattering of bright prints 
like those featured in milan 
other designers receiving british fashion council awards monday 
night included joseph for british classics rifat ozbek for british 
glamor catherine walker for british couture and joseph tricot for 
british knitwear 
mary quant who revolutionized fashion in the 60s with the 
miniskirt and has built an international clothes cosmetics and 
accessories empire was named to the hall of fame

increasingly doctors are under pressure to 
practice a style of medicine that is financially healthy for their

when six people were hurt in a car wreck a 
few years ago the surgeon on duty at nearby parkland medical 
center knew his small emergency room would be overwhelmed by all 
the cuts and broken bones 
so dr paul harper made a quick decision ambulances should 
carry the victims to three other hospitals besides parkland 
spreading the carnage around meant the injured would get help more 
quickly the doctor felt it was best for patients 
but in this case what was best for patients was not necessarily 
best for the hospital parkland lost business 
i caught it for that harper recalled the patients were 
supposed to come to parkland even though they couldnt handle 
them the head nurse told me the administration was mad and i 
shouldnt do that again 
such vignettes are common hospitals need patients doctors who 
send them away for any reason even for better care risk rebuke a 
gentle scolding perhaps a quiet lecture about hospital economics 
or worse 
in harpers case what came next was much worse his career is 
in ruins once he performed 350 operations a year the hospitals 
busiest surgeon now he performs a dozen 
harper has filed a lawsuit claiming the hospital engineered a 
slander campaign that destroyed his reputation and made doctors 
afraid to send him patients richard v wiebusch the hospitals 
attorney counters that harper is in trouble because he is an 
incompetent doctor not because he is a financial liability 
such open warfare between doctors and hospitals still is 
unusual but the rules of conduct are changing many fear that 
blunt coercion is becoming more customary as more hospitals press 
doctors to practice a style of medicine that puts the health of the 
institution first 
usually hospitals try to keep doctors in line through more 
subtle means nurses who lose their jobs when hospital beds stand 
empty cajole doctors to admit more patients many hospitals post 
names of those who fail to discharge elderly lowpaying medicare 
patients quickly enough physicians who dont get the message may 
suddenly stop receiving referrals from the emergency room an 
important source of new patients 
but gentle persuasion can turn harsh some doctors complain they 
have been dogged by crudely planted rumors of incompetence that 
hospital administrators have ordered other doctors to stop sending 
them patients or that their tiniest medical misjudgments are 
scrutinized by hospital review committees 
the worst of these abuses do happen said dr howard l lang of 
kentfield calif chairman of the american medical associations 
hospital medical staff section 
its not a daily occurrence he said but it is occurring 
enough that it is not rare we are not talking about a few whining 
malcontents there are real problems out there 
in general hospitals want their doctors to bring in lots of 
patients they want them to order plenty of xrays and tests when 
the sick are covered by generous private insurance plans and they 
want them to do just the opposite when medicare picks up the tab 
hospitals lose money when the elderly ill linger too long 
medicare categorizes virtually all old people into drgs or 
diagnosisrelated groups the drg classification for a particular 
illness pays a single flat fee for the patient no matter how sick 
he is or how long he stays in the hospital 
drgs encourage the hospitals to keep their costs down and yet 
the physician controls what the hospital bill will be said dr 
e haavi morreim of the university of tennessee the hospitals 
have had to do something to bring the physicians under the same 
incentive many hospital administrators have felt the necessity for 
some sort of system of carrots and sticks either formal or 
informal 
perhaps the most feared and effective of these sticks is peer 
review this process is the main way doctors watch over the 
competence of their hospital colleagues 
critics complain the system is sometimes perverted into a way of 
punishing those who are economic threats to the hospital or to 
other doctors at its most extreme doctors lose the right to admit 
patients or to perform specific tests procedures and operations 
there is overwhelming economic motive to eliminate doctors who 
cost the hospital money said dr verner s waite of downey 
calif doctors who complain about unethical billing practices 
unnecessary tests using items the hospital can charge for that are 
not necessary are all at great risk of a peer review 
waite has formed an organization to fight abuses of peer review 
he and many others believe that instead of weeding out bad doctors 
the system sometimes may protect dangerous hacks who are 
financially and politically powerful because they admit lots of 
patients 
when they want to get you they get you good they blackball 
you said dr david m freedman they will take away privileges 
for nothing when another doctor can murder someone and because 
hes in good standing they dont bother him 
freedman works with harper at parkland medical center an 86bed 
community hospital owned by hospital corporation of america the 
nations largest forprofit hospital chain 
freedman believes his own practice has suffered because he 
refused an order from a hospital administrator to stop referring 
patients to harper for surgery harper claims many other doctors in 
this distant suburb of boston also were warned not to send him 
patients in large part because he went against the hospitals 
financial interests 
sometimes a hospital can get rid of someone its considers a 
financial nuisance simply by giving another physician the sole 
right to perform that doctors medical specialty 
ohio cardiologist dr efraim montesinos contended he was forced 
to move his busy heart surgery practice from toledo hospital 
because his patients often ran up bigger bills than were covered by 
medicares flatfee drg system which began in 1984 
said dr peter overstreet one of montesinos supporters 
before drgs he was a hero since drgs he is a villain its the 
same guy 
montesinos said he cared for a large number of very sick 
patients they often took longer than usual to get better so the 
hospital lost money 
i am in the service of my patients he said i am not in 
the service of the hospital or the insurance company as long as i 
am a physician i will do what i think is proper for the patient 
last year the hospital decided to give an exclusive contract to 
a single heart surgery group montesinos who could have bid for 
the job believes the exclusive contract was a ploy to get me out 
of the hospital he moved his practice to the nearby medical 
college of ohio

dr john gibbs the hospitals director of medical affairs 
acknowledged finances played a role in the decision to change 
surgeons most of his montesinos patients werent covered 
under the drgs he said the resource utilization was high 
the amount of blood pump time a lot of xrays and the resources 
of the hospital 
hospitals now must go to considerable lengths to get rid of 
financially rebellious doctors but some fear it soon will become 
much easier 
some medical consultants and attorneys suggest rewriting 
hospital bylaws to permit financial credentialing this would 
allow review committees to consider doctors economic profiles 
including the profitability of their patients when deciding 
whether to allow them to admit patients 
others worry doctors will shortchange their patients if they are 
forced to put the hospitals interests first said the amas lang 
when you base medical staff privileges on economic criteria 
unrelated to quality you are setting up a situation where the 
patient can be harmed

dr robert hessler surveys the gridlock of 
gurneys cramming the emergency room hallways and makes a troubling 
diagnosis something is wrong beyond the chest pains broken limbs 
and stomachaches confronting him 
each patient has a crisis and has hurried here only to wait 
the emergency room is an overstretched strand in the health care 
safety net backlogged to the bursting point by overcrowding and 
social wounds 
the emergency room is overwhelmed with patients who need to be 
administered to says hessler assistant director of emergency 
services at cityowned bellevue hospital we do what we can 
minute to minute were using every little nook and cranny we can 
find to take care of these people 
five patients are going to intensive care four more to the 
heart attack unit twentyone have been patched up and are awaiting 
admission to the hospital including one man with an oxygen tube in 
his throat 
but the traffic doesnt stop with this batch of casualties a 
cluster of arriving emergencies queues up for triage the worst get 
seen first 
time passes with neither comfort nor silence in this makeshift 
ward patients on stretchers stare at the ceiling without so much 
as a curtain for privacy 
hessler 38 patrols the area with a stethoscope dangling from 
his neck and the pocket of his unbuttoned lab coat bulging with 
diagnoses on a notepad delays are more than just an inconvenience 
they imperil the delivery of care 
its not a pleasant way to be sick hessler said im 
always afraid that somebody whos seriously ill has to wait longer 
than they have to for a physician 
an average of 300 people a day pass through the emergency room 
at bellevue 
president bush mikhail gorbachev and other dignitaries would be 
rushed here if something happened while they were in new york 
because of its quality care city cops hurt in the line of duty 
prefer 264yearold bellevue the nations oldest continuously 
operating public hospital 
it also sees the worst wounds of the city crack addicts bullet 
holes from drugrelated assault guns aids patients the homeless 
who have no place else to go for care teenagers run over by 
subway cars who need their severed limbs reattached inmates from 
city prisons whose manacled ankles protrude from stretchers 
at bellevue battlefield images fit like bandages on a wound 
were kind of a field hospital this is war zone medicine we 
see all the casualties hessler said we see everything here 
we are the window to the world you will never go anywhere else in 
the world and see something we havent already seen at bellevue 
drugs are found in two out of three patients who are shot 
stabbed or hit by a car doctors say onefourth of the trauma 
cases involve people who have mixed two or more intoxicants 
usually alcohol and cocaine 
the homeless seek treatment for such ills as frostbite and 
rotted feet similar to soldiers who suffered trench foot a disease 
caused by prolonged exposure to wet cold and inactivity 
its like a third world situation hessler said and when 
its cold we see body temperatures of 66 degrees thats almost 
the equivalent of hibernation their whole body is cold not just 
their feet and hands 
the river of patients creates stress and frustration 
a patient doesnt have things people come to expect in a 
hospital a bed a room certainly not a tv if you have to go to 
the bathroom you get a bedpan hessler said 
the clamor is a long way from the quiet calm of hesslers 
hometown of billings mont he spent seven years at the university 
of miami medical school before doing his residency at new york 
university one of the countrys top medical schools 
hessler specialized in internal medicine but opted for 
emergency doctoring it allows him to do a little bit of everything 
that interests him internal medicine pediatrics 
obstetricsgynecology and surgery 
i like to work with critically ill patients they make you 
think and work the hardest you possibly can youre keeping people 
alive hessler said 
you have to do the right thing in the first few hours for 
whatever they have it puts such a stress on some people that one 
of the major problems is physician burnout some doctors arent 
able to function with that pressure 
or the daily dose of death for every rush of adrenalin that 
comes with saving a life there are terrible pendulum swings of 
seeing people die 
were not god not everybody can be saved hessler said 
but if you die in spite of everything i could possibly have done 
at least i feel we delivered the best possible care and did 
everything we could have 
he stays even though there are betterpaying jobs with less 
heartache 
people asked me why anybody from the nyu training program 
would want to do emergency medicine hessler said were a 
setting of last resort delivering care to people who dont have 
any insurance dont have any money and dont have any place else 
to go were here because we want to help people 
on call 24 hours a day hessler escapes the bedlam of bellevue 
at his suburban home in river vale nj he eases the tension by 
clipping his rhododendrons junipers and yews 
after a day of wild and chaotic work i can go home hessler 
said i can trim the bushes look at my lawn water the plants 
watch the birds flying around im used to a more calm lifestyle 
in addition to sewing up accident victims or treating kids who 
swallow rat poison doctors care for societal ills a polaroid 
camera is kept to document suspected child abuse a standard 
evidence kit can store specimens from rape victims 
in one sweep through the room hessler bandages a smashed nose 
takes vital signs on a heart patient scalpels the bureaucratic red 
tape so a patient can get xrays and tries to find out why a 
patient is waiting for attention 
youre doing three four or five things at the same time 
hessler said youre working so hard you dont have time to think 
about what youd rather be doing youre too busy patching peoples 
lives back together 
splotches of dried blood bandage wrappings discarded surgical 
gloves bedpans surgical tape syringe cases and other medical 
flotsam litter the floor 
patients stack their shoes coats and other possessionson the 
bottom of their gurneys as they wait to be released or admitted 
their medicine is not sugarcoated 
if you come to the emergency room i cant give you peace and 
quiet and comfort hessler said and for people who arent 
critically ill i can guarantee you a very long wait

a crush of patients has put city emergency rooms 
in critical condition the average wait is six to eight hours and 
one new york patient languished eight days before being admitted 
surveys show 
the backlog imperils the quality of care in 41 states and the 
district of columbia according to a survey last year by the 
american college of emergency physicians the northeast and west 
coast have particularly acute congestion 
its a cruel illusion to dismiss this as a new york problem 
this is emphatically a nationwide problem said dr arthur 
kellermann a member of the acep study group on overcrowding 
the only states not reporting backlogs were idaho minnesota 
nebraska new hampshire new mexico north dakota oregon utah and 
wyoming 
the nations 5700 emergency rooms had an estimated 92 million 
visitors last year according to the american hospital association 
there were 80 million visits five years ago in the past decade 
admissions from emergency room visits have risen 30 percent the 
aha said 
the overcrowding crisis stems from a number of reasons the 
surge in drug overdoses and drugrelated violence the aids 
epidemic the fact that emergency rooms are a place of last resort 
for the homeless and an estimated 37 million americans who have no 
health insurance a nursing shortage cutbacks in the number of 
hospital rooms and formulas for federal money that discourage 
emergency admissions 
we are on the verge of a major crisis said dr stephan 
lynn chairman of the acep study group and director of emergency 
medicine at st lukesroosevelt hospital in new york city 
the lights never go out the noise never turns off lynn 
said some of my patients have no means to pay their bill and 
some could buy the hospital but all of my patients wait when

a 1989 survey by the new york state health department showed 
that of 2000 emergency room patients being treated one day 210 
waited eight to 24 hours for care and 108 waited longer than 24 
hours 
the average wait in an emergency room is six to eight hours

association of public hospitals 
at harborucla medical center in los angeles patients wait 
eight to 10 hours four times longer than they did 10 years ago 
the emergency room is so busy that it turns away arriving 
ambulances 20 percent of the time 
that results in ambulances wandering around the city trying to 
find emergency departments that are open said dr robert

the host of masterpiece theater the head of 
the metropolitan museum of art and the former editor of the new 
yorker have something in common with some slumdwellers theyre 
on a rent strike 
the welltodo tenants are protesting conditions at their tony 
fifth avenue apartment building overlooking central park on the 
upper east side 
the 15story building where a doorman stands guard in a 
blackandwhite marble tiled lobby with brass fixtures floral 
bouquets and tasteful lithographs does not resemble the apartment 
houses in sections of manhattan brooklyn and the bronx where rent 
strikes are common 
their plight is not likely to elicit pity from the average new 
yorker in a city where a studio apartment can easily cost 1000 a 
month most tenants at 1150 fifth ave pay less than 2000 a month 
for their eight and nineroom apartments because their rents are 
limited under the citys rentcontrol regulations 
they may not live in squalid tenements overrun with drug 
dealers but some residents say theyve been forced to live with 
leaky roofs bad plumbing and broken elevators for months 
everything is ruined said lucille turecki a divorced 
mother of two daughters gesturing to the watersoaked hallway 
carpets and peeling ceilings in her sixroom apartment i stay 
out of here as much as possible 
since march residents in 45 of the 58 apartments have withheld 
rent to force the landlord to improve conditions city housing 
officials say the building has 66 pending code violations 
striking tenants include pbs television host alistair cooke 
former new yorker editor william shawn and museum director philippe 
de montebello 
the 96th street building is being converted into a cooperative 
and apartments much like those for which some tenants are now 
paying 1500 a month are on sale for more than 16 million with 
monthly maintenance fees of 3200 
the buildings owner arnold goldstein said the rent strike is 
a typical ploy tenants use during coop conversions to force owners 
to sell them their apartments at lower prices 
theyre paying scandalously low rents said goldstein the 
system is wrong if a poor workingclass man with a family in the 
bronx pays more per square feet than alistair cooke he and his 
wife are two elderly people rambling around nine rooms and a young 
working man has to live with his family in three rooms 
cooke 81 host of masterpiece theater said part of his 
apartment ceiling was damaged because of a leak the owners didnt 
repair for months he said the elevator was broken for eight months 
before it was fixed 
the residents said few of them are very wealthy and could never 
afford to buy their apartments 
were not being greedy paula blasband said recently 
sitting in her spacious whitewalled living room with windows 
overlooking the park its been a horrible experience the people 
here are very fine people they dont like going on a rent strike 
and having their names in the paper 
tureckis topfloor apartment is in the worst condition she has 
been in and out of court with the landlords for four years and says 
she has spent 38000 in legal fees she has lived there since 
1972 
she transformed her dining room into a storage area for clothes 
and other items damaged by roof leaks and moved her dining room 
table into the hallway but the remaining furniture in her living 
room always has a sprinkling of plaster dust from the scarred 
ceiling overhead 
building manager joe masino acknowledged tureckis apartment was 
a disaster but said most building repairs have been completed 
he said the turecki apartment was so badly damaged because it 
took a long time and cost a lot to waterproof it

the national enquirer has been tattling about 
celebrities for decades enticing millions of supermarket shoppers 
with tantalizing headlines about lustful jilted or diseased stars 
now inquiring minds are witnessing the tabloid under siege 
in recent weeks cbstvs 60 minutes did an expose los 
angeles magazine uncovered a sources scandal and elizabeth taylor 
and roseanne barr have filed lawsuits 
but national enquirer editor iain calder said last week the 
tabloids millions of readers largest circulation of any paper 
in america neednt worry 
readers can expect more juicy headlines on the order of 
princess di pregnant how she used food and sex techniques to 
make sure its a girl 
you wont see any difference in the way we cover stories 
calder said from his lantana fla office it sort of goes with 
the territory every few years you suddenly get attacked 
after all these stories are run within a few days the dust 
will settle 
the current wave of enquirerbashing started with the october 
issue of los angeles magazine which said the tabloid paid sources 
for stories they had nothing to do with 
the national enquirer with a circulation of 41 million 
maintains it scrupulously investigates stories before publication 
basically what your lawyers tell you is do you believe it 
and have you checked it calder said 
rod lurie who wrote the magazine article said he obtained a 
10page list of enquirer payments and sources many of the sources 
insisted they never supplied the information they were credited 
with according to lurie calder said the document was stolen 
one by one by one by one they all told me the same thing 
they were paid for stories they had nothing to do with yet they 
were sources lurie said 
one of those sources was stuart goldman a writer charged with 
unauthorized entry into a fox broadcasting co computer in an 
unrelated case he was identified as an investigative reporter in a 
60 minutes piece on the enquirer 
i received about 12 checks for stories i didnt work on 
goldman said when i questioned it they said dont worry about 
it you were probably shorted on other stories 
the enquirer maintains its accuracy has been unfairly 
questioned 
the phony sources story is ridiculous calder said if we 
wanted to run phony stories using phony sources we wouldnt pay 
the amount of money that we pay for stories that are eventually 
killed 
for every 10 soories nine are killed more than 850000 is 
paid to freelancers each year on stories killed 
lurie was amused by calders response for mr calder to be 
questioning the credibility of my sources is ironic hes been 
paying good money to these sources for a long time 
calder believes he knows why the tabloid is under siege 
there are a group of powerful celebrities that have put 
together a war chest and gone to gavin de becker to go after us 
said calder who wouldnt name names 
de becker a security consultant whose 120 clients include such 
stars as michael j fox cher and miss barr was one of 65 people 
interviewed by lurie 
no there arent a specific group of clients bent on 
destroying the enquirer said de becker the idea of 100 major 
media figures gathering in a gymnasium shouting give me the 
head of the national enquirer is absolutely ridiculous 
but cher attorney john forbess predicted more legal woes for the 
tabloid 
i think celebrities in general are getting more and more fed 
up with the outrageous nature of the articles being written 
forbess said i think more lawsuits will be filed 
with sources being paid for stories they had nothing to do 
with attorneys will think again about filing a lawsuit 
carol burnett whose 16 million judgment against the 
supermarket tabloid was reduced to 800000 on appeal said her 
lawsuit apparently didnt have much effect on enquirer reporting 
because its still going on 
just last month miss taylor filed a 20 million libel suit 
against the national enquirer the suit said miss taylor was 
hospitalized with nearfatal pneumonia when a frontpage headline 
june 12 screamed liz docs furious shes boozing it up in the 
hospital 
and miss barr and husband tom arnold filed a 35 million federal 
racketeering lawsuit earlier this month against the national 
enquirer and star tabloids both owned by new yorkbased macfadden 
holdings inc over the publication of love letters 
the line in the sand has been drawn here and the enquirer and 
celebrities are going to be doing some battles in the 90s lurie 
said

the most soughtafter stories by the national 
enquirer generally involve the personal trials and tribulations of 
hollywoods top television stars 
michael j fox vanna white roseanne barr and oprah winfrey are 
frequent cover material along with such bigscreen entertainers as 
eddie murphy and sylvester stallone 
but the most enduring national enquirer personality is elizabeth 
taylor 
whos left of the great great movie stars who have a colorful 
life asked enquirer editor iain calder she has all these 
marriages and tragedy in her life shes probably the most colorful 
character of our time 
shes the last of the oldtime movie stars 
i hope liz is around for many decades but when she goes 
theres nobody to replace her 
the feeling is not mutual miss taylor last month filed a 20 
million libel suit against the enquirer claiming the tabloid 
falsely labeled her a heavy drinker with a disfiguring disease 
in recent years the enquirer has moved away from movie stars to 
television actors in the 1970s we found television sold more 
than movies calder said 
the one exception has been miss taylor after the actress filed 
suit the tabloid hit the supermarket checkout lanes a week later 
with the cover story liz back on drugs doctors warn this time 
it will kill you 
there is no individual dominating national enquirer attention at 
the moment calder said 
weve done very well with dolly parton cher and vanna 
believe it or not calder said weve done well on liz when 
weve had a good story and oprah 
the lantana flabased tabloid has a staff of 50 reporters 
plus an untold number of freelancers and a terrific source 
network all over the world the editor said 
calder said more than 50 percent of the enquirers stories are 
noncelebrity articles 
we work very hard to come up with upbeat stories it isnt 
just a bunch of negative stories about celebrities he said 
a recent copy of the tabloid included stories about a man 
returning from the dead a book by presidential firstpooch millie 
with first lady barbara bush serving as ghostwriter a 101yearold 
groom and a man who survived a fall from a highrise

a judge on monday dismissed a lawsuit 
seeking compensation for a man who fought antiabortion activists 
in court to get an abortion for his comatose wife 
the suit by martin klein of long island sought 10 million from 
the hospital and two antiabortion activists 
hospital officials demanded he get a judge to appoint him 
guardian of his wife nancy before the abortion could be 
performed the activists fought the appointment in court 
the suit filed in june 1989 by klein 37 an accountant named 
as defendants north shore university hospital in manhasset and 
antiabortion activists john short of farmingdale and john 
broderick 
the suit alleged they caused klein emotional distress and forced 
him to pay more than 50000 in legal fees 
doctors had told klein that an abortion would help his wife 
recover mrs klein emerged from her coma after undergoing an 
abortion last year 
in dismissing the suit state justice harry hunter said in a 
written ruling that the hospital acted properly in refusing to 
allow the abortion unless klein was appointed guardian 
hunter ruled that the lawsuit was unjustified and the hospital 
was entitled to reimbursement for the money it spent defending 
itself he set a hearing for nov 7 to determine the amount 
kleins attorney jay dankner said an appeal was likely if 
klein is penalized at that hearing 
the judge also found that short and brodericks actions did 
not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct in 
fact they effectively protected nancy kleins interests he 
wrote 
mrs klein who was about four months pregnant was in a car 
accident in december 1988 
klein went to court in january seeking guardianship but 
broderick and short battled him fiercely losing each time but 
appealing all the way to the us supreme court the high court 
refused to hear the case 
mrs klein 34 eventually emerged from the coma and lives at a 
rehabilitation hospital in oyster bay dankner said she is able to 
communicate and makes frequent trips home to be with her husband 
and daughter he said

the boxy brickred towers of 
mexicos first nuclear power plant jut into the moist tropical air 
from a sandy beach flanked by palmfringed lagoons 
not everyone is thrilled about laguna verde a 654megawatt 
plant in southeastern mexico that started normal operations in 
august 22 years after the project began and 14 years behind 
schedule 
the federal energy commission says laguna verde based on a 
general electric boilingwater reactor will help power mexico when 
its petroleum begins to run out current consumption rates and 
proven reserves indicate oil and gas production will continue at 
least 53 years 
energy commission spokesman mario santoscoy said officials hope 
to begin two more nuclear plants by the year 2000 
spindly transmission towers march through the lush foliage into 
the hills from laguna verde in veracruz state 190 miles east of 
mexico city only three miles from where hernan cortez landed to 
conquer mexico 
many opponents are beginning to feel the campaign against the 
plant is futile protests began in 1986 after the chernobyl 
nuclear accident in the soviet union 
there is no possibility whatever to stop it because the 
government proceeds without listening to anybody said novelist 
homero aridjis president of the environmentalist group of 100 
protests peaked in 1988 when tens of thousands of demonstrators 
repeatedly jammed the streets of jalapa capital of veracruz the 
navy was called in to end a nineday blockade of the highway 
outside laguna verde which means green lagoon 
a military post is still opposite the plants main gate but 
antinuclear fervor has faded with time and frustration 
demonstrations now are fewer and smaller 
most of the plants foes seem to oppose nuclear power in 
general but many claim laguna verde is a badly built example of an 
obsolete us design that is poisoning the veracruz coastline with 
radiation 
nearly every claim by either side is disputed and bickering is 
more common than discussion 
there are constant emissions of radioactive gases 
environmentalist roberto helier said quoting sources at the plant 
vinicio serment cabrero plant information director asserted 
we havent had discharges of radioactive materials either liquid 
or gas 
critics pass out copies of official lab tests showing high 
levels of strontium 90 in shrimp caught nearby the plant safety 
director sergio zorrilla has other documents citing later tests 
with low strontium 90 levels 
opponents claim the plant was stopped 41 times during its test 
run including several emergencies officials admit to 30 or so 
but insist none was an emergency 
a recent official study by nine foreign experts found the plant 
had released only minute amounts of radiation critics accuse the 
experts of bias helier cited studies showing even small amounts of 
radiation can increase risks of cancer 
spent fuel from laguna verde will remain radioactive for 
thousands of years 
critics also claim the lengthy test period four times longer 
than scheduled indicates problems 
john ahearn a member of the us nuclear regulatory commission 
from 1978 to 1983 said a long test can either indicate a lot of 
problems or it can indicate prudent caution 
former plant manager augustin perez ruiz insisted it was the 
latter we did everything with the rigor of a novice we didnt 
want anything to happen 
ahearn said a long test period might help train workers 
the most critical element in nuclear power plants are the 
people he said if youre in a country that has never built a 
plant before its going to take them a longer time 
according to critics the plant workers are not welltrained 
theres always a factor of risk said aridjis the novelist 
and the most unpredictable of all is a human error 
up the road from laguna verde many people in the town of palma 
sola have come to terms with the plant a butcher shop has taken 
the name carniceria nuclear 
hundreds of residents work at the plant which helps replace 
income lost when tourists began to abandon local beaches and market 
vendors went elsewhere to buy fish 
i was in the marches against the plant said 30yearold 
agueda grajales who sat behind the cash register in a hardware 
store now i would not go 
at the beginning we were afraid because they didnt tell us 
anything but now the plant is working and nothing is 
happening she said

the nations biggest indian reservation 
macdonald is accused of accepting bribes and kickbacks from 
businesses operating on the 26100 squaremile navajo reservation 
if convicted in tribal district court on all 42 counts of bribery 
conspiracy and ethics violations he could be jailed for up to 23 
years 
also on trial is his son peter rocky macdonald jr an 
unemployed lawyer who faces 23 counts of bribery theft by 
extortion conspiracy and other violations 
youve heard how peter macdonald delivered the goods for those 
who paid the price prosecutor richard hughes said in closing 
arguments monday it reveals a pervasive and cynical corruption 
that marked the fourth administration of peter macdonald sr 
defense attorney val jolley argued that macdonald made no 
threats or promises when he accepted loans and gifts from 
businessmen and said the prosecution had put forward only shaky 
circumstantial evidence 
each stone must fit to build the arch jolley told the jury 
if you find theres gaps in the arch the arch collapses 
macdonald later told supporters outside court that the case was 
brought to keep him from running for the new office of tribal 
president which replaces the office of chairman 
im confident i did no wrong macdonald said the 
proseuction didnt prove one thing of what they were alleging 
the trial being heard by a jury panel of six navajos one 
pueblo indian and five nonindians began oct 1 it had been 
expected to last several weeks but the prosecution called its last 
witness on thursday and the defense decided against calling any 
witnesses 
hughes said macdonald received payments of more than 400000 
from people doing business with the tribe between november 1986 
when he was elected to a fourth fouryear term and feb 17 1989 
when he was placed on administrative leave by the tribal council 
businessmen making loans to macdonald were never paid back 
hughes said 
each one of them paid just after they were on the hook he 
said of the businessmen who either had contracts or hoped to have 
contracts with the tribe 
macdonald and former chairman peterson zah are on the nov 6 
ballot for the newly created post of tribal president 
macdonalds second trial is scheduled to begin oct 23 that 
trial involves conspiracy charges stemming from the tribes 
purchase of a ranch for 334 million from a company which paid 
262 million for the property only five minutes earlier his son 
is a codefendant in that trial 
a third trial in which macdonald faces 93 fraud counts stemming 
from the tribes 1986 primary and general elections is scheduled 
to begin dec 4 suspended vice chairman johnny r thompson is a

republicans are trying to turn veteran rep frank 
annunzio into a casualty of the nations savings and loan crisis 
the 75yearold illinois democrat has rolled over his 
competition in 12 reelection bids but now he faces a tough 
challenge from a former chicago cop who is hitting hard at 
annunzios dealing with the sampl crisis 
republican state sen walter dudycz contends annunzio who heads 
a house subcommittee that oversees thrifts looked the other way 
while the crisis was brewing 
annunzio meanwhile points his finger at the gop he blames the 
republican policies of the white house for the nations sampl 
problems 
he was among those who raised questions about the role of 
president bushs son neil as a director of the failed silverado 
banking savings amp loan association in denver 
annunzio proudly displays banners and buttons declaring jail 
the sampl crooks 
dudycz has responded in kind his buttons say jail annunzios 
sampl friends 
analysts are predicting a close race and see the contest as a 
test case for voter reaction to the sampl disaster 
people are looking to see if politicians will be blamed for 
the sampl scandal said political analyst don rose its an issue 
thats at a low simmer in some places in the country waiting to 
boil over 
dudycz questioned annunzios ethics when it was revealed that 
the congressman over the past decade had accepted more than 50000 
in campaign contributions tied to sampls annunzio contends there was 
no conflict of interest 
this is truly a david vs goliath race frank annunzio and 
the goodoldboy democratic party vs walter dudycz and the 
taxpayers said dudycz 
annunzio insists its the other way around he said republicans 
are exploiting democratic crossover voting patterns to try to oust 
him from the 11th district which includes part of northwest 
chicago and suburban communities 
the national republican party has earmarked me for defeat 
annunzio says they thought i would play dead because of my age 
but im not going to roll over 
the national republican congressional committee filed a 
complaint with the federal election commission claiming that 
annunzio filed to provide employment information about 20 
contributors who were associated with a maryland thrift 
annunzios camp maintained the complaint was gop retribution for 
an samplrelated ethics complaint the democrats filed against 
republican rep denny smith of oregon 
annunzio also has been criticized for reports that two of his 
sonsinlaw once worked for the savings and loan industrys chief 
lobbying group the us league of savings institutions and he 
admits he once tried to get one of them a position with the federal 
home loan bank board in chicago 
he contends there ws nothing improper about the request and 
stresses that the position was nonpaying 
annunzio has attacked dudycz for being on the cook county 
sheriffs payroll as a deputy while he was a state senator working 
primarily in downstate springfield 
both men say their ties to the community will make the 
difference each uses ethnic workingclass roots to seek support 
from a constituency composed of police officers firefighters and 
other bluecollar residents who are firstgeneration americans born 
of eastern european parents 
annunzio a senior citizen in a community with the highest 
median age of any illinois district casts himself as a champion 
of the elderly he voted against recent federal budget bills 
because they contained cuts in medicare 
dudycz 40 is a relative newcomer to the political scene who 
calls himself an americans american he attracted attention in 
1989 when he led daily rallies at the art institute of chicago to 
protest an exhibit displaying the us flag on the floor 
the selfstyled populist has railed against increases in state 
income taxes and property taxes hes counting on radio advertising 
and doortodoor canvassing to increase his name recognition 
annunzio who has spent most of his recent time in washington 
is trying to make up for his absence with advertising bought from 
an 800000 campaign war chest 
weve basically had to change from a 60s type of campaign to 
a sophisticated marketing strategy go from zero to 60 in 63 
seconds said kevin tynan one of annunzios sonsinlaw and his 
campaign manager

largerthanlife campaign posters of 
ousted prime minister benazir bhutto her loyalists and political 
opponents clutter the pristine boulevards of the cities and the 
bumpy dirt roads to the villages 
colorful party flags flutter atop mudandstraw huts modern 
highrise buildings on bicycles bullock carts and pickup trucks 
loudspeakers blare the slogans of favorite candidates 
despite all the trappings the campaign for the oct 24 
parliamentary election lacks the wide public enthusiam that 
heralded pakistans return to democracy two years ago 
this election is being fought in the courtroom not the 
countryside 
when president ghulam ishaq khan ousted ms bhutto on aug 6 and 
called the election three years early most pakistanis were pretty 
fed up with her performance and an ineffective parliament paralyzed 
by 20 months of bickering 
the caretaker government made up of former allies with little 
in common except contempt for ms bhutto thought it would produce 
enough evidence to prove she presided over pakistans most corrupt 
and inept government 
they boasted she would be forced out of politics for seven 
years maybe forever and the leftleaning pakistan peoples party 
founded by her father the late prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto 
would be destroyed 
government lawyers crossed the country filing charge after 
charge against the 37yearold former prime minister six former 
cabinet ministers and ultimately her husband 
but even ms bhuttos strongest critics now privately admit the 
evidence is questionable and the credibilty of the caretakers 
called the undertakers by pakistans urdu and englishlanguage 
press has been called into doubt 
we wanted to make her the villian but instead shes becoming 
the victim said one government official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity now we are on trial and the verdict will be 
delivered oct 24 
promises of elections are the threads holding together the 
delicate fabric of pakistans democracy which unexpectedly 
returned in 1988 when the military dictator gen mohammad zia 
ulhaq died in a still unexplained plane crash 
progovernment newspapers and stateowned radio and television 
carry daily reassurances from ishaq khan and the powerful army 
chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg that the polls will be held 
on time come what may and that power will be transferred to the 
choice of the people irrespective of who wins 
but in a country ruled by the military for more than half its 
43year existence such promises have been broken too many time in 
the past to inspire confidence 
politicians hurl accusations and insults at each other instead 
of talking about the real issues that trouble this moslem country 
of 110 million people a soaring birthrate increasing poverty and 
rising prices that are putting many of the basic necessities out of 
reach 
the politicians certainly arent capable of running the 
country said imran rafiq bhatt a 25yearold charity worker in 
the eastern village of visvian we should give the country to 
japan on lease for eight years and maybe they could straighten 
things out 
the events surrounding ms bhuttos dismissal and her trials 
before the special tribunals resurrected from the days of martial 
law have only served to make pakistanis more cynical about the 
future 
but analysts say the caretaker government has become ms 
bhuttos best friend making her the underdog and helping halt and 
then reverse her declining popularity and galvanize the 
disillusioned rankandfile in her party 
ms bhutto the daughter of wealth and privilege is cast as the 
poor peoples sister the champion of freedom and democracy 
the scrappy fighter of political oppression 
it is a role she played so well for a decade after her father 
was overthrown in 1977 military coup and hanged two years later 
the daughter of wealth and privilege advocating freedom democracy 
and people power 
while the caretaker government was busy trying to collect facts 
and figures in a bureaucratic manner she crisscrossed the country 
in a pajero jeep inching through the surging suffocating crowds 
and appealing to the sentiments of the people then traveling all 
night to her next court appearance 
soon the stories of largescale corruption and mismangement 
began to fade and sympathy for her grow 
her appeal is direct sentimental and downtoearth she still 
carries the day said political analyst syed alamdar raza the 
coalition in power and her opponents who want to be in power have 
no one who comes anywhere near her 
when she was in power and times were good ms bhutto said in an 
interview she occasionally thought about the day when she would 
give up politics to devote time to her young children son bilawal 
and daughter bakhtawar 
now is not the time to talk or even think about retirement 
she said during a weeklong campaign swing through eastern punjab 
the countrys most prosperous province and home to more than 60 
million pakistanis 
government officials and bureaucrats admit privately they 
underestimated her drive her ambition and her steely 
determination 
even her most bitter opponents calculate she and the peoples

for the second time in less than a week the 
house voted monday night to scrap strict antiobscenity 
restrictions on the national endowment for the arts and to penalize 
grant recipients who are subsequently convicted of violating 
obscenity laws 
the house took the unusual step of tacking the entire nea 
measure it had approved thursday onto a separate 119 billion 
appropriations bill for the interior department and several other 
federal agencies including the arts endowment and sent the 
combined package to the senate 
supporters of the parliamentary maneuver argued that prospects 
for final enactment of the houses previously approved endowment 
bill which now awaits senate action would be enhanced by 
attaching it to a higher priority appropriations measure also 
headed for the senate floor 
rep pat williams dmont said there was little if any 
chance that the original bill which would authorize a threeyear 
extension of the arts endowment would survive in the waning days 
of an electionyear congress mired in a budgetary crisis 
he said the appropriations bill stands a much greater chance of 
final congressional passage than the authorization bill 
this will assure i hope that something that the house wants 
in this very divisive matter reaches the presidents desk and 
becomes law williams said 
the money bill which the house passed on a 32780 roll call 
says obscenity shall not be funded by the arts endowment but 
it shifts to the courts the responsibility for deciding whether 
federally subsidized arts projects are obscene 
under the bill grant recipients convicted of creating obscene 
art must give the government its money back before they can apply 
for any new nea grants 
in addition the bill orders wideranging reforms in the 
endowments grantmaking procedures to make its financing decisions 
more responsive to the public interest it would increase the 
states share of grant funds from 20 percent to 35 percent over 
three years 
identical language was contained in the endowments 
authorization bill which the house approved 34976 last week 
on monday the house approved the same compromise measure 
drafted by williams and rep e thomas coleman rmo on a 234171 
roll call as a substitute for a more strongly worded proposal by 
rep ralph regula rohio 
regulas amendment would have forbidden the endowment to 
subsidize obscene or indecent works and ordered the nea chairman to 
ensure that federally supported works are appropriate for a 
general audience 
on a followup vote the house ratified the williamscoleman 
compromise on a 34258 roll call then the house approved 32780 
the entire appropriations bill for the interior department the 
forest service some energy department programs the smithsonian 
institution and other agencies for the current fiscal year which 
began oct 1 
included was 180 million in arts endowment spending this year 
a 5 percent increase over its 171 million budget last year 
before the final vote the house approved 251155 a proposal 
by rep mike synar dokla to increase grazing fees on public 
lands by 500 percent over the next four years the plan supported 
by environmental interests was heatedly opposed by western 
lawmakers 
the bill also includes a oneyear moratorium on exploring for 
oil and gas in federal waters in many areas off new england the 
east coast florida california the pacific northwest and alaska

deep in the night iraqi 
forces rapidly approach a us artillery position the mock 
battle peaks with a cry of breakaway 
specialist joe pierce slaps on nightvision goggles and races a 
selfpropelled howitzer cannon across the sand he doesnt always 
find his next position 
pilots and drivers of the armys 101st airborne division hoping 
to hone their nightfighting skills are finding that the desert 
terrain creates problems for the hightech goggles 
the difficulties include a reduction in depth perception and 
bright lights ruining the sensors in some older model goggles 
the 101st 70 miles south of the kuwaiti border is the closest 
full american division to the frontier and could be the first to 
engage in combat with iraqi forces 
the us military has stressed its nightfighting ability as a 
big advantage over iraqi forces who avoided night battles during 
the 198088 war with iran 
we expect to fight at night said maj lee flake 36 of 
swansea sc 
looking through the batterypowered goggles everything in a 
200yard radius appears bathed in bright green light the goggles 
look like binoculars with a special head brace 
because everything in the desert is the same color its hard 
to pick up whether its a hill or its flat said pierce 20 of 
dodridge wva during maneuvers saturday 
hitting a small sand ridge at 15 mph can bounce the driver out 
of the allterrain vehicles that are the backbone of army forces in 
saudi arabia 
i thought mike tyson had knocked me one said sgt ernest 
west 39 of trenton ga comparing a jolt from a ridge to a punch 
from the former heavyweight boxing champion 
several fatal airplane and helicopter crashes in the past week 
have been blamed on difficulty in seeing upcoming hills and 
recognizing the difference between the sky and desert 
even when pilots get close to the ground the landing spot can 
be obscured by blowing sand that the nightvision goggles cannot 
penetrate 
the us military is now avoiding groundhugging flight 
maneuvers that simulate night combat conditions and requiring two 
pilots at the controls 
the problem is especially acute when theres a full moon or no 
moon 
the glasses intensify small amounts of light and a full moon 
often washes out any contrast in the landscape without any moon 
theres little light available for the goggles to gather 
when theres no moon you just drive straight and pray said 
one driver from the 502nd field infantry regiment 
another problem especially with the older models is that any 
bright light hurts the wearers eyes and can also destroy the 
goggles 
the tubes in about 100 goggles were blown out when oncoming cars 
flashed highbeam headlights at military convoys 
officers said the flashes from exploding shells might 
temporarily render the goggles ineffective but not destroy them 
they point out that the technology has improved vastly in recent 
years and constant training is improving performance

an impoverished refugee womans arrest for 
scavenging through garbage cans in search of recyclable items has 
angered advocates for the poor and raised questions about who has 
the right to turn trash into cash 
the right to eat takes precedence over the citys right 
said karina omalley director of a green bay homeless shelter and 
a member of a task force studying homelessness in wisconsin i 
dont see why the city has to pit itself against the poor 
this is a way for them to eke out a living without 
panhandling 
ms omalley was among those who criticized the arrest of tru 
vang a 56yearold laotian hmong refugee cited in august on 
charges of violating a new antiscavenging ordinance in madison 
the ordinance was enacted this year after the wisconsin 
legislature passed a law requiring all communities to recycle 
aluminum paper glass and other materials by 1995 to conserve 
dwindling landfill space 
the city attorneys office on sept 28 dropped the charges 
against ms vang who had faced a fine of more than 300 after 
mayor paul soglin and several other city officials decried her 
arrest as a wrong application of the antiscavenging ordinance 
the mayor said the law was aimed at people who might be tempted 
to pickuup large amounts of recyclable material already sorted and 
bagged for the citys curbside recycling program not at a poor 
person going through trash 
although the charge was dropped the incident embarrassed many 
in madison the state capital and home to the largest university of 
wisconsin campus this town of 170000 prides itself on ethnic 
diversity social concern and its strong opposition to the vietnam 
war during the 1960s and 70s 
we can give tax breaks to developers and atampt and then we 
find time to prosecute a woman for selling cans to supplement her 
welfare alderman andrew heidt complained during a recent city 
council meeting 
the clash between recycling interests and poor people looking 
through garbage cans to find aluminum cans or newspapers to recycle 
is inevitable some say 
communities that mandate recycling have an economic interest in 
ensuring that material set aside for recycling is collected by the 
city and sold to recycling outlets to finance the programs 
continuation 
everybodys seen the poor people with the shopping carts who 
do this pick through garbage in a way theyre providing a 
service to the public said pat vanderburgh assistant 
superintendent of the milwaukee rescue mission a homeless shelter 
in milwaukee 
he predicted that organized recycling programs could reduce such 
peoples income 
as you have more recycling youre going to have less 
recyclable material available to people who need to go through the 
garbage to make money said state rep spencer black one of the 
authors of wisconsins recycling law 
but black said he believes the madison ordinance is unnecessary 
if it applies to scavengers 
this situation is different i dont see any value in a law 
that stops people from recycling black said 
some suggest that a creative solution exists 
col leon ferraez a spokesman for the salvation army 
headquarters in verona nj advocates programs that pay poor 
people for recycling by picking up garbage no one wants 
there should be a way to bring both sides together recycling 
material and recycling lives ferraez said 
others predict there will always be enough recyclable trash for 
the poor but municipalities may not have the business sense to use 
recycling as an economic development tool for everyone 
why should counties recreate the wheel when there are people 
who need to make ends meet that are capable of working in programs 
that can serve the community said dave hurd a recycling 
specialist for a new york city concern that pays for garbage 
collection and provides recycling services to businesses with trash 
disposal and recycling problems

gargan 59 goes on to say hes appalled at the national debt

loan scandal 
but mostly im sad that we as a nation have thrown up our 
hands in surrender to the politicians and bureaucrats who have put 
us in this predicament he writes 
gargan urges readers to return pledge cards and asks that they 
push for an amendment limiting how long lawmakers may serve and 
cast out all incumbents 
theres no way we could end up with anything worse than what 
we already have he argues 
gargan last week said he formed thro last summer with 45000 of 
his own money since then about 400000 in donations have rolled 
in hes spent between 2000 and 55000 per ad a few

think you have trouble balancing your checkbook 
mayor david dinkins runs a municipal household with a 222 million 
electric bill a 20 million gasoline tab and 103 police horses 
that gobble up 70000 a year in hay and feed pellets 
new yorks 28 billion expense budget is larger than that of any 
american city and all but two of the 50 states 
its easy to wind up 14 billion in the hole when you have 
these kinds of costs 
10 million to run central park for one year 
122 million for a years supply of disposable plates cups 
napkins forks knives and spoons for school cafeterias 
5500 a month for 40 pounds of dog chow for each of 18 police 
dogs 
42 million a year to make install and repair 67420 traffic 
signs 
42 million for a winters supply of rock salt 135000 tons 
if the citys budget is a far cry from the average households 
it also bears relatively little resemblence to that of any other 
municipality in this hemisphere 
no other us city has more than two public hospitals new york 
has 16 and they consume 43 million a year in latex gloves 13 
million in needles and syringes 18 million in diapers infant 
and adult 
similarly the city pays an unparalleled 2 billion a year in 
public assistance by one recent count 849768 new yorkers are on 
welfare a figure greater than the population of all but 10 us 
cities 
with the economy slumping nationally and in the northeast new 
york is grappling with a deficit that has prompted comparisons to 
the citys nearbankruptcy in 1975 
on any given day the city spends more than 1 million on 
overtime and much more in times of crisis after an arson fire 
killed 87 people at a bronx social club firefighters alone worked 
500000 in overtime inspecting other such clubs 
the citys secondquarter overtime king was john mckenna who 
made 16400 or 29 percent of his 55400 yearly salary mckenna 
senior stationary engineer at queens hospital center was 
responsible for the installation of hundreds of new air 
conditioners 
some of the citys spending figures are simply heartbreaking on 
the night of july 2 it spent 400000 to house 3196 homeless 
families 462 of them in barracksstyle shelters as child welfare 
department caseloads swelled in the second quarter social workers 
billed 34 million in overtime 
according to a recent count the city was spending 688 million 
yearly to care for 54712 foster children 10805 per child the 
cost is an increase of 166 percent since 1985 
the city at least gets a badly needed break by buying in bulk 
about 18000 a week for 180000 eggs and 450000 a month for 
300000 pounds of poultry the 23000 municipal cars trucks 
tractors snowblowers motorcycles and other vehicles which use 
about 17 million gallons of regular unleaded gasoline a year fill 
up at well below the average pump price 
some of the costs of local government are fairly esoteric such 
as 300000 a year to reduce noise and 27 million for a twoyear 
study to determine the origin of trash that washes up on the 
beaches about 5 million goes to plant 12000 new trees but since 
about 20000 trees die each year the tree population still 
declines by about 20 a day 
city officials seem to have a good handle on some costs but not 
on others for instance last years bill for english and spanish 
newspapers for the 20000 jail inmates was 15523068 that was 
one paper for every 30 inmates the ratio prescribed by law 
on the other hand no one seems to know the final bill for the 
11000 pairs of shoes purchased last year 9000 of them for the 
corrections department or the 12 million square feet of netting 
to cover garbage barges 
the telephone bill is another mystery new york telephone says 
it does not divulge information about any customers bills 
this much is known earlier this year the manhattan district 
attorneys office discovered that one of its secretaries was 
accepting collect calls from her imprisoned boyfriend and then 
transferring his calls and those of other inmates to points 
across the map the bill had passed 10000 before she was fired 
one last item the sanitation department will replace 9700 of 
its 22000 curbside litter baskets at a cost of 535350 
where do the old ones go 
people burn leaves in them and they use them for barbecues 
said department spokesman jim hart im not going to their house 
for dinner

the dream dazzled them seduced them gave them 
the will to dissolve their nation and unleash tremendous social 
upheaval 
to the people once called east germans the dream was western 
prosperity and the belief that it was tantalizingly close perhaps 
just around the corner 
chancellor helmut kohl and his golden vision of affluence won 
another victory sunday that will help solidify his chances of 
winning the united german elections on dec 2 
his conservative christian democrats won four of the five states 
in what was once east germany but is now only the rundown lowrent 
backwater of a wealthy nation 
as far as the territorys evolution from communism to democracy 
the elections were vitally important because they will give the 
former nation five new state governments 
these states will have to quickly dismantle the strongly 
entrenched communist framework and reshape it to fit the federalist 
system in western germany 
on a social and political level however the elections were new 
fuel for the engine that drove german unity in the first place the 
quest for affluence 
when east germanys hardline communist rulers were toppled last 
year the borders were opened to the west and the seeds of german 
unity took root 
east germans saw the prosperity enjoyed by their western 
neighbors kohl and his staunchly free market party to many of 
them were synonymous with wealth and success 
he campaigned on behalf of his christian democratic surrogates 
in the months before the nations first free elections in march 
the party promised quick unification as a means to quick 
prosperity 
they were elected overwhelmingly their mandate was largely 
affirmed in may when the nation chose its first freely elected 
local governments 
unity finally came on oct 3 but the nation that was known as 
east germany is still east germany if not in name 
more than 2 million of its 8 million workers are either 
unemployed or being kept on artificial payrolls subsidized by west 
german money grocery prices have skyrocketed and rents and energy 
costs will soon follow 
the main opposition the leftleaning social democrats has been 
campaigning on a gloomanddoom platform arguing that greater 
social benefits are needed to help the easterners survive in the 
new free market economy 
they have warned the westerners that higher taxes are inevitable 
to pay for kohls quick push to unify their nation with an economic 
wasteland 
on sunday however eastern germans voted for the christian 
democrats again in four of the five states 
wolfgang thierse a top east german social democrat alluded to 
the lure of affluence in remarks that were probably sour grapes but 
also touched on the very real belief among east germans that kohls 
party is still their key to salvation 
we cant present ourselves and dont want to present 
ourselves as the party of big money thierse said we also 
cant present ourselves as miracle workers 
but i think so many people here are so uncertain and so 
worried that they want to believe in miracles he added so 
perhaps they may think that the cdu is closer to the money and 
thus promises them prosperity more quickly 
the results of the elections were enough to allow kohs party 
to wrest from the social democrats control of the upper house of 
parliament where representation is based on state balloting 
it also put kohl in a stronger position heading into the dec 2 
national parliamentary elections when once again his party and the 
promise of affluence for eastern germany will be put to the test 
though he leads in the polls however this will be the first 
election in which western germans will also have a say in the 
matter

army wives and girlfriends here have 
had to learn how to fix cars coach football and serve as standin 
fathers at the maternity ward ever since 14000 soldiers marched 
off to saudi arabia 
you see the women doing the trash you see women like me 
changing a flat said charlotte clabough her husband 1st sgt 
james clabough is in saudi arabia 
she and tibbie smith whose husband sgt gary smith was sent 
to the persian gulf as well have also learned to coach youth 
football since their spouses shipped out 
weve got some boys who at first thought these women dont 
know anything about football said mrs clabough i feel 
weve won their confidence 
jerome washington director of an athletic program at fort 
stewart that serves 1000 youngsters said 14 of the 18 soccer 
coaches now are women 
most of them knew we didnt have enough men he said they 
know for the programs to go weve got to have coaches 
many women are also getting ready to coach about 700 women 
scheduled to deliver babies between now and march at the base 
hospital 
a husband normally would be there to help with the delivery 
said maj ann kenny chief of community health nursing at fort 
stewart 
ideally it is a family event it helps to have someone there 
to hold your hand and support you said kenny who is pregnant 
her husband maj timothy joe kenny also is in the persian gulf 
some of fort stewarts teachers many of them army wives have 
also volunteered to stay after school to help kids with homework 
theres a lot of little people out there who need to know that 
just because daddy is gone things can still be normal said 
teacher mary gleason whose boyfriend 1st lt robert irwin is in 
saudi arabia 
the women also have found ways to unwind as they wait for word 
on when their husbands might return 
on one recent night about 60 lined up outside kracker jacks a 
nightclub featuring muscular young men who wear little clothing 
you cant sit home and crochet said waitress carrie kates 
everyone needs to let their hair down once in a while and this is 
a relatively harmless way to do it

now that its own nuclear standoff with the 
soviet union is easing the united states is looking for a way to 
defuse the potential for atomic war between pakistan and india 
the situation is that both india and pakistan have nuclear 
weapons or at least the wherewithal to assemble components into 
deliverable warheads quickly and both sides know it says paul 
l levanthal president of the nuclear control institute 
the united states suspended aid to pakistan on oct 1 because a 
law required such action if president bush was unable to certify 
that pakistan does not possess a nuclear device the suspension 
took effect automatically when bush failed to certify 
secretary of state james a baker iii outlined his thoughts on 
the nuclear issue last week to pakistani foreign minister yaqub 
khan the state department refused substantive comment on the 
meeting citing the sensitivity of the subject matter 
leonard spector a nuclear arms expert at the carnegie endowment 
for international peace calls the evolving situation in south asia 
very dangerous 
despite strong indications of pakistani efforts to acquire a 
nuclear weapons capability the united states generally looked the 
other way in recent years seeing pakistan as an indispensable ally 
in efforts to drive soviet troops out of afghanistan 
with pakistan providing safe haven for afghan rebels and the 
united states supplying arms to the insurgents the soviets decided 
to end their presence in afghanistan in february 1989 
us economic and military aid to pakistan this past fiscal year 
totaled 582 million the highest total worldwide after israel and 
egypt 
but pakistans strategic importance to the united states has 
diminished now that the soviets have withdrawn from afghanistan and 
the cold war has faded 
and with pakistan apparently having succeeded in its quest for 
atomic weapons south asia thus becomes the first region of the 
developing world in which principal rivals have achieved mutual 
nuclear deterrence levanthal says 
one complicating factor for the administration is that pakistan 
is being run by a lame duck government that wont leave office 
until after national elections on oct 24 
several experts suggested that the administration and congress 
in consultation with the pakistanis attempt to work out terms for 
renewing aid to pakistan 
an indefinite aid cutoff could rob the united states of leverage 
with the pakistanis and actually accelerate the arms race in the 
subcontinent says james phillips of the heritage foundation a 
conservative think tank 
he says the united states should try to promote negotiations 
between the pakistan and india on nuclear arms reductions 
levanthal agrees the challenge for the united states is to 
act promptly in a way that puts a cap on the present situation 
avoids triggering a nuclear arms race and sets the stage for a 
longerterm process of reduction and elimination of nuclear 
weapons he says 
spector says the administration should encourage pakistan to 
sacrifice the gains it has made in its nuclear program over the 
past year this would reduce the possibility that continuing 
tensions between india and pakistan particularly over the strife 
in kashmir could degenerate into a nuclear exchange 
if we could accomplish that it would be worthwhile says 
spector 
the uspakistani landscape is cluttered with side issues that 
further confuse an already murky situation the two countries were 
able to weather differences in the past because of the shared 
hostility toward the soviet union 
but now washington is concerned about major flows of heroin 
from pakistan into the united states each year and also doubts the 
countrys resolve to restore democracy prime minister benazir 
bhutto was dismissed from office on aug 6 by presidential order on 
charges of corruption and abuse of power 
beyond that the administration is displeased that pakistan has 
been funneling us aid for afghan rebels based in pakistan to the 
most antiwestern of the rebel factions

democratic challenger paul hubbert executive secretary of the 
67000member state teachers union 
hunt is trying to put his name in the history books alongside 
george wallace as the only alabama governors elected to two 
straight terms hubbert is trying to become the first national 
education association member elected governor of a state according 
to nea records 
hubbert has tapped the state teachers unions political war 
chest and its statewide volunteer network several top aides to 
former governor wallace also are working in the hubbert campaign 
hunt has warned business interests that hubbert is a prounion 
candidate who would carry out a liberal agenda former president 
reagan visited alabama to attend a hunt fundraiser and rally 
hubbert says the governor of alabama is elected by the white 
middleclass working male and that by watching what pickup trucks 
carry as far as bumper stickers are concerned youll see what 
direction the race is going 
but the guy in the pickup truck i think hes more of a 
hunt voter than a hubbert voter says margaret latimer a 
political science professor at auburn university 
hunt a north alabama fruit farmer and a primitive baptist 
preacher was reagans campaign chairman in alabama in 1976 and 
1980 he never went to college and sold amway products while 
struggling with a sixfigure debt left from a losing 1978 campaign 
for governor 
a bitter democratic primary four years ago alienated many 
traditional democratic voters and propelled hunt from gop obscurity 
to victor 
like wallace of the 1960s hunt bristles at criticism of the 
state in june he seethed at a national magazine article that 
depicted alabama as chained to a political history preventing it 
from enjoying new south prosperity tax reform and educational 
advancement 
in contrast hubbert says alabama must recognize it rivals many 
third world countries in its pockets of poverty infant mortality 
rates and dismal health care in backwater communities 
hubbert also from rural alabama holds a doctorate in 
education he became known as governor in the 1970s by building 
the biracial teachers union into a major political force 
despite his ties to liberal and progressive wings in the alabama 
democratic party hubbert has billed himself as fiscally 
conservative and tough on crime 
the ethics of both candidates are a campaign issue 
democrats produced a check showing that hunts campaign 
organization paid a personal mortgage note held by hunt and his 
wife hunt said the mortgage was tied to debts left over from his 
losing 1978 campaign 
hubbert said the hunt camp pilfered a document from hubberts 
headquarters the document says the democratic nominee should focus 
on the question is guy hunt a crook 
hubbert is running a dirty tricks campaign hunt asserts 
hunt ran an attack ad showing hubbert sitting in a car with his 
top associate a black political organizer from the alabama 
education association 
the ad reminded me of the campaigns of the early wallace 
years said political science professor latimer deliberately or 
not she believes the hunt ad will play racist 
the governors campaign press secretary says the ad is simply an 
attempt to point out hubberts base of support the state teachers 
union 
hubberts campaign is his first race for statewide political 
office and it comes one year after he received the liver of a 
15yearold boy in a transplant operation 
a hunt supporter has injected the issue of hubberts health into 
the campaign 
ive had doctors tell me that anybody who has a liver 
transplant can become very sick very quickly said former state 
attorney general charlie graddick 
hubbert 54 is healthy as a horse retorted hubbert 
spokesman michael tucker were seeing an attack by a thoroughly 
discredited hatchet man 
graddick switched to the republican party after unsuccessfully 
seeking to become the democratic gubernatorial nominee in the 
bitterly contested 1986 primary

here is a comparison of key parts of rival 
deficitreduction plans backed by house democrats and the senate 
finance committee 
gasoline no change in the house bill the senate would raise 
the 9cent tax to 18 cents a gallon by 1992 neither bill would 
affect heating oil 
indexing the house would forgo for one year the annual 
adjustments to income tax brackets and personal exemptions which 
are designed to protect against inflationcaused bracket creep 
that would mean higher income taxes for everybody in 1991 the 
senate has no such provision 
alcohol house raise the 1250agallon tax on 100proof 
liquor by 1 double the beer tax to 32 cents a sixpack raise 
taxes on most wines including table wine which would go from 3 
cents a 750milliliter bottle to 25 cents senate raise liquor 
tax by 120 double beer tax raise wine tax to 21 cents 
tobacco either would raise the 16cent cigarette tax by 4 cents 
in 1991 and another 4 cents in 1993 snuff cigars and other 
tobacco would face 25 percent tax increases each year 
flying either would raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets 
to 10 percent 
luxuries either would impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of 
the price of cars above 30000 boats above 100000 jewelry 
above 5000 furs above 10000 house or 5000 senate and 
private planes 100000 house or 250000 senate 
tax rates the house bill would raise the top rate paid by the 
wealthiest people now 28 percent to 33 percent it would impose a 
10 percent surtax on those with taxable incomes over 1 million 
the senate bill would do neither 
itemized deductions the senate would limit itemized deductions 
except those for medical expenses and investment interest of 
people with adjusted gross income over 100000 only 95 percent of 
deductions would be allowed against the portion of income above 
100000 
capital gains the house bill would allow a person to avoid tax 
on half of up to 200000 of capital gains earned in a lifetime 
the gains could come from most investments but not from stocks a 
person with annual income under 100000 could avoid tax on another 
1000 a year of gains including those on the sale of stock no 
capital gain would be taxed at a rate above 28 percent the senate 
bill has no capital gains provisions 
lowincome both bills would increase the earnedincome tax 
credit which benefits lowincome families with children as a way 
of offsetting some of the increased excise taxes the house plan 
included an 11 billion fiveyear expansion of the credit the 
senate 168 billion 
medicare taxes house would increase to 100000 the maximum 
annual wage to which the 145 percent medicare tax applies the tax 
is withheld as part of the social security tax the senate would 
raise the limit to 89000 the senate would require all state and 
local government workers and their employers to pay the tax the 
house would continue exempting workers hired before 1986 
medicare premiums house would raise the 2860 monthly premium 
for medicare part b insurance to 2990 next year and 4620 by 
1995 senate 2990 next year and 47 by 1995 
medicare deductible house would raise to 100 through 1995 the 
present 75 deductible which beneficiaries must pay before 
medicare starts paying for doctor bills senate 150 each year 
social security either would require all state and local 
government workers not covered by a public retirement plan to pay 
social security taxes

an effort to restrict the export of 
potentially harmful pesticides may be the toughest issue remaining 
as house and senate conferees struggle to complete the 1990 farm 
bill 
behindthescenes negotiations have been fierce as senate 
agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy seeks to halt the 
export of pesticides that are either banned or unregistered in the 
united states 
details also must be approved on a tentative agreement on 13 
billion in agriculture budget cuts reached friday night by the 
conference committee 
the cuts would be part of the fiveyear 500 billion deficit 
reduction package being negotiated by congress 
under the tentative plan subsidized acreage would be reduced by 
15 percent in each of the four years after the 1991 planting year 
deficiency payments to farmers the difference between market 
price and the governmentestablished target price would be 
averaged over 12 months instead of five as currently figured 
the farm bill sets policy on virtually every aspect of us 
agriculture 
leahy dvt who chairs the conference committee has shaped a 
bill praised by environmentalists for advances in agricultural 
conservation 
but his efforts to restrict pesticide exports brought fierce 
resistance from the 5 billionayear us pesticide industry 
leahys plan approved by the senate would allow chemical 
companies to export only pesticides that are registered in the 
united states or have a designated food tolerance level exceptions 
would include pesticides sent abroad for research or to fight 
famine or communicable disease 
chemical companies say the restrictions would cost them billions 
of dollars in overseas business and force the closing of american 
manufacturing operations resulting in job losses 
the national agricultural chemical association contends that 
many pesticides are unregistered in the united states because they 
are not needed in this climate not because they are dangerous to 
human health 
however backers of leahys plan say us fruit and vegetable 
growers are at a competitive disadvantage because they cannot use 
the same pesticides that are being sold by us companies to 
foreign farmers 
environmentalists say residue from some of those pesticides is 
showing up in dangerous levels on imported food in us grocery 
stores 
sen richard lugar rind the ranking republican on the senate 
agriculture committee has proposed an amendment supported by the 
chemical industry 
his amendment requires exporters to give epa information on 
chemicals they send abroad but it does not give epa the authority 
to stop pesticide exports 
the bush administration opposes language restricting pesticide 
exports but agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly in a 
letter to leahy urged adoption of the lugar amendment if exports 
are to be addressed in the farm bill 
leahy contended the lugar plan would gut tough legislation 
passed by both the house and the senate to stop the export of 
pesticides that the environmental protection agency considers 
probable carcinogens and too dangerous for domestic farm use 
the house bill would be less strict than leahys plan it would 
allow the export of unregistered pesticides if the epa says they 
pass health and safety review the food and drug administration can 
screen for them and if they are registered in one country that is a 
member of the organization of economic cooperation and development 
oecd countries include many nations whose food safety standards 
are less stringent than the united states 
in their letter to leahy yeutter and reilly said we have 
proposed to prohibit the export of any pesticide which has been 
suspended canceled or denied registration for human health 
reasons 
we have also advocated controls on the export of other 
unregistered chemicals which go a long way toward improving food 
safety at home and protecting human health and the environment 
abroad the letter said 
but leahy said that if the lugar amendment is adopted only two 
usmade pesticides would be stopped from export chlordane and 
heptachlor both manufactured by felsicol of memphis tenn both 
have been banned from us agricultural use since 1978 because of 
extreme toxicity but are sold overseas for termite control

china has another bumper grain harvest and 
will have tremendous problems of storage transportation and 
marketing according to an agriculture department analyst 
but hunter colby of the departments economic research service 
said china will continue to import us grain primarily wheat 
despite backtoback record harvests 
one reason is that us grain is very high quality and they 
can use it to blend in with their somewhatlowerquality grain 
colby said in a telephone interview 
reports from beijing point to a total grain harvest of 422 
million metric tons this year agriculture vice minister chan 
yaobang said the grain crop would exceed the 1989 harvest of 407 
million tons the previous high 
colby a china specialist for the usda said that while wheat 
imports from the united states will continue they probably will be 
reduced because of the big domestic harvests 
an interesting thing about this year is that theyre having 
the same problems the soviets are having he said they cant 
store it theres so much grain that its sitting outside and they 
lose a lot 
the soviet union which suffers huge losses of grain after 
harvesting because of poor storage and marketing facilities also 
is having a bumper grain harvest the usda last week estimated 
total soviet grain production this year at 235 million metric tons 
a nearrecord 
colby was asked to comment on other reports from beijing that 
chinese leaders are cautiously planning a partial return to 
collective farming in hopes of raising productivity 
land was distributed to individual farming households 10 years 
ago as the commune system was dismantled that allowed farmers to 
sell some crops on the free market grain production and rural 
incomes jumped sharply 
but growth recently has stagnated and plots worked by 
individual farmers an average of 15 acres are too small for 
efficient mechanization 
thus according to the englishlanguage china daily party and 
government officials recently decided that conglomerates in 
charge of supply production and sales would be established to 
hasten largescale mechanization 
no details were provided by beijing colby said there has been 
talk for several years of trying to introduce largerscale farming 
in some areas that could support it 
but colby said he was not prepared to interpret this as a move 
back to collectivization of chinese agriculture 
meanwhile he said the huge harvests of the last two years are 
putting a lot of budgetary pressure on chinas government which 
announced plans to raise its grain purchase price 
also officials have said the state would buy the entire grain 
harvest a practice abandoned in the 1980s lately the state 
contracted with each farmer to buy part of his harvest leaving him 
to sell the remainder on the free market at potentially higher 
prices 
the government is talking about ensuring that all the grain is 
to be purchased and at subsidized prices colby said so its 
going to cost and theyve had terrible budget deficits the last 
couple of years this is just going to make it worse 
 
washington ap an agriculture department scientist says 
kenaf a fastgrowing plant that already has potential as a wood 
pulp substitute could also be a good livestock forage crop 
charles l webber iii of the departments agricultural research 
service said kenaf a bamboolike relative of cotton and okra 
would be grown throughout the south and southwest 
a plant to produce newsprint from kenaf is under construction 
near raymondville texas 
webber said kenafs value as a feed would give farmers another 
good reason to grow it for one thing he said kenaf is an annual 
which presents fewer problems than with crops such as alfalfa that 
must be planted each year 
and kenaf can be grown under a much wider range of conditions 
than can alfalfa all over the south and southwest he said 
it can tolerate more acid and poorer soils than alfalfa as 
well 
webber an agronomist who works at the usda agencys south 
central agricultural research laboratory in lane okla reported 
on kenaf last week in riverside calif at an international 
conference on industrial crops and products 
some of his remarks and findings also were released here by the 
agency 
although kenaf can be used to make silage webber said its best 
potential could be as a lessexpensive supplement in alfalfabased 
pellet feeds 
some businessmen have told me they expect to produce 
alfalfakenaf feed pellets that will have the high protein values 
of normal alfalfa pellets but at about 75 percent of the price 
he said 
kenaf reaches a peak as a feed crop in 90 days after planting 
according to webbers research 
before 90 days the yields are not that high he said but 
theres no advantage after 90 days because the plant begins to get 
woody 
kenaf yields run as high as 31 tons per acre dried weight at 
90 days of growth with a minimal input of fertilizer and 
pesticides webber said with a 90day harvest date it may 
even be possible for growers to get two cuttings a year 
 
washington ap rye production has always been erratic in the 
united states but the latest agriculture department figures show 
the crop has faded to a fraction of its former glory 
as of oct 1 according to last weeks crop report rye 
production this year has dropped to about 101 million bushels 
down 26 percent from 1989 output that is a record low for the 
crop reflecting reduced plantings by farmers 
south dakota is the largest producer with 187 million bushels 
estimated this year compared with 324 million in 1989 georgia 
no 2 produced 132 million bushels down from 161 million last 
year 
records show production has varied greatly over the years with 
a peak of nearly 57 million bushels in 1935 as recently as 1984 
rye output was about 325 million bushels

who commands what has become a vexing 
question as more countries commit units to the multinational force 
confronting iraq in the persian gulf 
the disparate allied armies in the arabian desert must be 
forged into a unified fighting force if they are to defeat saddam 
hussein said michael dockrill who lectures in war studies at 
kings college london 
military analysts agree that the estimated 350000 troops 
airmen and sailors from 21 countries cannot be an effective force 
until a chain of command has been established with clearly defined 
operational areas and functions 
the us and british air forces work closely together but the 
french canadians italians and belgians also are deploying 
aircraft 
president bush and allied leaders have met to discuss the 
problem as have the field generals bush said last month that in 
the event of war the command structure will function very 
smoothly 
at sea operational zones have been established for the eight 
western navies involved in enforcing the un embargo on trade with 
iraq 
if war begins wider cooperation will be essential on land as 
well as at sea and in the air artillery fire zones and tank 
movements will have to be coordinated communications systems 
integrated air defense sectors assigned 
capt ton van gurp who commands the two dutch frigates in the 
persian gulf complained in a recent interview with the daily de 
telegraaf of amsterdam the way it is right now i dont even 
know my assignment in time of war we dont know what were 
supposed to be doing 
we want to know whos going to be in charge here if war 
breaks out because its getting more dangerous every day 
he said the lack of a unified command structure among the us 
british french italian canadian belgian and other ships could 
leave them badly exposed van gurp said he preferred a un 
command 
most countries involved agree that iraq must be forced out of 
kuwait which it seized on aug 2 but not necessarily on how it 
should be done or who should do it 
gen h norman schwarzkopf the us commander dropped a broad 
hint last month that the allies would have to do the job militarily 
when their forces were ready 
saudi arabia sensitive to moslem criticism for inviting the 
americans to protect the kingdom and islams holiest shrines said 
quickly that no attack could be launched from saudi soil without 
its approval 
three us carrier battle groups are in the area however plus 
warships armed with cruise missiles b52 bombers are based on the 
indian ocean island of diego garcia 
who will be in charge of what in combat and the need for 
overall coordination are major questions 
military experts say a major risk is the possibility of one 
allied national force mistakenly firing on another in battle some 
units have weapons iraq also uses such as frenchbuilt mirage jets 
and sovietmade t72 tanks making recognition difficult in combat 
the gulf armada includes more than 70 ships from 12 countries 
scores of jet fighter squadrons from 10 countries and ground forces 
from 14 speaking four languages 
the americans are by far the dominant force with about 200000 
military personnel committed in the biggest us overseas 
deployment since vietnam 
a rapidly growing arabislamic force from at least 11 nations is 
led by gen khalid bin sultan son of the saudi defense minister 
and is not likely to put itself under us command 
britain has said it will coordinate its forces with 
schwarzkopfs its 6000man 7th armored division known as the 
desert rats has trained with us troops in germany during nato 
maneuvers 
france not part of natos military command structure has made 
clear it will operate autonomously and is deploying its 4000man 
rapid action force alongside arab troops in the northeastern saudi 
desert 
this situation is containable while the various forces in 
saudi arabia remain on the defensive and each country occupies a 
welldefined sector of the desert dockrill said in a recent 
paper but what will happen if war with iraq eventually breaks 
out and even goes in iraqs favor previous examples do not augur 
well for the outcome 
noting largescale multinational military operations in world 
war ii and korea he wrote unless coalition forces are tightly 
controlled by one supreme commander with a clear chain of command 
as during the normandy landings in 1944 setbacks can easily lead 
to disaster if the enemy enjoys the benefits of good internal lines 
of communication and a cohesive and efficient command structure

a freshman congressman rushed to the house 
floor the day after president bush and congressional leaders 
announced their nowmoribund budget agreement 
let us vote this down and get to work on crafting a fair and 
compassionate deficitreduction package he said attacking the 
medicare cuts and workingclass tax increases 
he sounded like a democrat but he wasnt he was rep craig 
james of florida president of the republican freshman class in the 
101st congress 
james illustrates an oftenignored fact in congressional 
politics the differences between the two political parties 
especially when it comes to domestic programs are very small 
in the two weeks since the budget deal as the midterm 
elections neared 
both parties in congress have backed plans to ease increases in 
medicare fees 
both parties have embraced cutting back or eliminating the 
proposed increase in taxes on gasoline ditto for home heating oil 
both parties have proposed cutting capital gains taxes 
neither party has proposed any further specific cutbacks in 
federal spending beyond those in the original agreement 
i think there is a great blurring of the two parties in this 
country and i think thats regrettable said sen warren rudman 
rnh the american people do not know who to blame 
lawmakers of both parties may not have solved the nations 
financial ills but they have been working overtime on blame 
avoidance 
democrats the doves of congress for the past two decades dont 
want to take the heat if something goes wrong in the persian gulf 
so they adopt a resolution pledging support for bushs policies 
republicans after campaigning for years for entitlement 
reform join with democrats and run the other way when proposals 
are made to trim the biggest entitlements social security and 
medicare 
robert billings legislative director of the american 
conservative union said his group has noticed a trend toward the 
center from both the left and the right in congress 
on fiscal issues thats where it hurts us the most he 
said lamenting the weakening gop support for spending cuts and no 
new taxes 
ron zucker of the americans for democratic action a liberal 
group that also monitors congressional voting said that on social 
issues the differences remain pronounced maybe even more 
polarized 
but on the budget you are going to get some weird 
flipflops he said 
even the tax issue one where the differences between the two 
parties should be easy to discern can get muddy 
democrats dont want to talk about raising taxes though most 
believe it necessary we have to change the debate from taxes to 
who gets taxed and the fairness of it said house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo 
and republicans no longer want to claim that giving tax breaks 
to the rich is the key to economic growth for all we have never 
been a party that was sympathetic to the higher incomes said 
rep mickey edwards rokla 
of course with elections just four weeks away the two parties 
need positions to run on the us vs them kind of stuff 
so house democrats seized on the tax portion of the budget 
agreed upon by their own leaders and declared it unfair to 
exploit what they see as a political advantage they created a 
soaktherich plan designed to boost middleclass voter appeal in 
uncertain times 
in a rare phenomenon republicans are more divided than the 
democrats but they appear to be falling back on a stance of 
opposing any new taxes george bush or not if that prevents them 
from offering their own deficitreduction proposal so be it but 
it makes for good campaign stuff 
both party positions appear more aimed at the voters than at 
accomplishing anything regardless of the final outcome theyll 
let the incumbents claim at home that they fought the good fight 
so what about the challengers the ones voters could turn to if 
they get tired of all this 
even there its hard to see the difference between the two 
parties the most popular theme in both republican and democratic 
campaign ads is asking voters to throw the rascals out

although iraq has large conventional arms 
stockpiles it will quickly run out of parts for its hightech 
weaponry if war breaks out in the persian gulf military analysts 
believe 
one focus of saddam husseins propaganda war against the 
usled multinational force has been the sophistication of his 
weapons systems 
last week he claimed iraq had developed a new missile called 
the alhijara or stone with a range of hundreds of miles 
also iraq is reported preparing to field what is known as a 
fuelair explosive bomb with blast potential approaching that of a 
nuclear weapon 
a british newspaper independent on sunday reported that libya 
was negotiating on baghdads behalf with chilean arms manufacturer 
industrias cardoen to buy such bombs they are known as the poor 
mans nuclear bomb 
other hightech weaponry in the iraqi arsenal include its 
domestically built alhussein and alabbas missiles as well as its 
own version of the airborne warning and control systems or awacs 
plane 
but weapons experts make the point that the more sophisticated 
weaponry is the more prone it is to break down 
such weaponry also relies heavily on spare parts 
iraq has created a fairly commprehensive weapons industry but 
it relies heavily on imported components including parts for its 
missile guidance systems 
theyll probably use up a lot of the sophisticated and 
semisophisticated stuff pretty fast said bernard trainor a 
retired us marine general 
thats one of the concerns of the us buildup right now 
said trainor who heads the national security program at harvard 
universitys kennedy school of government we have to build 
enormous stocks of both conventional weapons and sophisticated 
weapons 
saddam has got to do the same thing and that poses great 
problems for him because he doesnt have the spare parts to 
keep the sophisticated weapons in action he said 
not only does iraq build its own missiles it also makes its own 
version of the advanced soviet t72 tank called the lion of 
babylon and a 210mm cannon with a range of 40 miles 
that is the longest range of any artillery piece in production 
most iraqi weaponry is of either soviet design or manufacture 
us defense secretary dick cheney will be asking soviet 
officials for intelligence data on them when he visits moscow this 
week a senior defense department official said in washington on 
thursday 
moscow said last month that it was willing to share such 
information 
michael dewar a military analyst with londons international 
institute for strategic studies said war with iraq would not be a 
walkover 
he predicted that the usled multinational force would launch 
a massive cataclysmic sudden shock type of action lasting a 
matter of days perhaps a week 
in that scenario shortages would not be a factor dewar said 
paul rogers a defense analyst in the department of peace 
studies at the university of bradford in england also said he did 
not believe shortages would be an issue but disagreed about how 
long a war would last 
i think it will be extremely bitter extremely intensive early 
on but i think theres a real risk of it being drawn out into a 
protracted conflict he said 
were talking about a drawnout land war where they have 
considerable advantages in their combat engineering skills they 
have such large numbers of artillery and tanks that if things break 
down theyll just be thrown away rogers said 
iraq has an estimated 5500 tanks and 7500 artillery pieces and 
air defense guns 
rogers said the most critical shortages are likely to develop in 
saddams air force given its vulnerability to western missile 
strikes and bombing as well as the hundreds of advanced us 
british and french jet fighters arrayed against it 
he said iraq might be able to get spare parts and replacement 
planes from libya and jordan two arab nations that have remained 
friendly to saddam

the autumn tradition of burning leaves has pitted 
neighbor against neighbor as overflowing landfills force more 
people to resort to the smoky practice that inflames cleanair 
advocates and asthma sufferers 
heated battles are taking place in states like illinois and 
pennsylvania where bans on the dumping of yard waste in landfills 
recently were enacted 
residents who consider the smell of burning leaves falls 
perfume and object to the cost and hassle of other disposal methods 
are asserting their right to light up 
sufferers of allergies asthma or other lung ailments are 
demanding to breathe air free of smoke that environmentalists and 
health officials say can be dangerous 
its always amazing to me how intensely people feel about this 
issue said joseph minott executive director of the delaware 
valley clean air council in philadelphia its part of american 
culture 
a number of states ban leaf burning in heavily populated areas 
primarily because of concerns about the spread of fire said dave 
ryan of the environmental protection agency the epa discourages 
leaf burning but doesnt consider it a major threat to air quality 
ryan said 
in rural areas some communities ban the practice or restrict 
when it can take place 
but with 11 states enacting bans against dumping leaves or other 
yard waste in landfills local officials are under pressure to 
loosen restrictions on leaf burning 
residents in some illinois towns face charges of up to 170 a 
bag to get rid of their leaves 
its a real catch 22 said hal englund editor of the 
journal of air and waste management in pittsburgh many 
communities banned burning to protect their air but now theyre 
worried about saving their landfills so now theyve got to rethink 
their burning ordinances 
environmentalists say the solution lies in recycling and 
composting a foreign concept to most people said jack darin 
a field representative for the sierra club of illinois 
theyre used to carting it to the curb rather than piling it 
in the back yard he said 
in warmington pa local officials bowed to public pressure and 
withdrew a proposed leafburning ban

presidents mikhail s gorbachev of the 
soviet union and vaclav havel of czechoslovakia were the 
frontrunners in speculation about todays awarding of the 1990 
nobel peace prize 
if it were up to the norwegian news media they would be joint 
recipients they were the most prominent names among about 10 
candidates local nobel watchers believe would make likely choices 
for the prize awarded to someone who has worked for peace 
championed liberty and helped the downtrodden or promoted 
brotherhood 
but the name of the winner is a closely guarded secret and the 
media are often wrong the nobel committee considered 100 
nominations this year 
the prize has been withheld 19 times since it was first awarded 
in 1901 
another difficulty in guessing the winner of this years 
700000 prize is that the nobel committee has been changing the 
geographic focus of the award 
the changing has been very important to no longer look just 
to the western world but to the whole world gidske anderson 
leader of the fivemember committee said in an interview last 
week 
she said she found the media speculation amusing 
alfred nobel the swedish inventor of dynamite established the 
award in his 1896 will 
he said it should go to the person who shall have done the 
most or the best work for fraternity between peoples for the 
abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and 
promotion of peace congresses 
the awards committee has taken some liberty in interpreting 
nobels intention 
it has awarded the prize 16 times to organizations or agencies 
it has awarded it to more than one person 16 times and it has 
recognized and encouraged work that has not yet borne fruit in the 
fields of peace and human rights 
many of the prodemocracy activists and reformers in eastern 
europe who were mentioned last year as possible winners may have a 
better chance now 
havel once was a jailed dissident now he is czechoslovakias 
president 
gorbachev was touted last year as a likely candidate along with 
former president reagan for their disarmament efforts 
although both were nominated again news media speculation in 
norway and sweden has focused on gorbachevs encouragement of 
democratic reforms in eastern europe 
another perennial candidate is nelson mandela 
when the african national congress leader was nominated for this 
years prize he was still in prison serving his 27th year for 
plotting to overthrow the white minority government of south 
africa 
now he is free preparing to negotiate with the government on an 
end to apartheid amid the worst fighting among black south africans 
in decades 
mandela would be the second anc leader to receive the award 
then anc president albert luthuli won the 1960 prize 
other frequently mentioned candidates were chai ling one of the 
chinese prodemocracy activists pope john paul ii german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher and burmese opposition leader aung 
san suu kyi 
nobel endowed four other prizes in medicine physics chemistry 
and literature which are awarded in stockholm sweden 
the nobel memorial prize in economic science established by the 
central bank of sweden in 1968 will be awarded tuesday 
the nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced 
wednesday 
last week mexican poet and essayist octavio paz won the 
literature prize two american doctors joseph e murray and e 
donnall thomas won the medicine prize for pioneering organ and 
bone marrow transplants 
the prizes are presented dec 10 the anniversary of nobels

wind during a concert at the us military academy that blew the 
minds of past and present cadets

played to about 4000 people saturday night several hundred of 
them cadets 
cadets pumped their arms picked on imaginary guitars and danced 
in the aisles it was dylans first appearance at west point 
ive been here for four years and this is the best time ive 
ever had said senior steven cavioli jr to get cadets to 
unleash is really something and bob dylan did it tonight were not 
politically agreeing with bob dylan were just shifting all that 
stuff aside and enjoying his music 
dylan saw nothing out of the ordinary in playing at the military 
academy said spokesman elliott mintz 
the nature of the venue is not of great importance to bob 
hes just bob mintz said 
dylan fans were in disbelief at the concerts setting which 
they described as the belly of the beast 
lucian truscott iv a west point graduate whose novel dress 
gray is a scathing portrait of cadet life noted that the academy 
prepares its cadets so when youre 45 or 50 you can be the 
national security adviser 
the idea that theyd introduce bob dylan into that is 
amazing he said

iran and iraq have resumed diplomatic relations after a decade 
of hostility and a soviet news agency says saddam hussein has 
indicated a willingness to withdraw from kuwait if he is allowed to 
keep some territory 
the renewed ties with iran could help iraq circumvent the 
unordered embargo on trade with baghdad prolonging the desert 
stalemate and dampening the resolve of members of the international 
alliance arrayed against it 
also on sunday a special flight arrived in baghdad to take home 
more than 100 soviet military advisers and oil workers diplomats 
said from the iraqi capital 
prior to its invasion of kuwait baghdad relied on moscow for 
the bulk of its advanced weaponry soviet diplomats said the 180 
advisers who remain in iraq could leave when their contracts expire 
unless they opt to depart sooner 
iraq threatened last week to restrict the travel of soviet 
military advisers if their government disclosed any of its military 
secrets to the united states 
in other developments 
in london the independent on sunday newspaper reported that 
libya was negotiating for iraq to purchase a highly explosive bomb 
from a chilean arms manufacturer a company official confirmed the 
report the fuel air explosives weapon has been described as 
the poor mans nuclear bomb 
kuwaiti opposition figures meeting in jiddah saudia arabia 
with their governmentinexile and said they wanted guarantees of 
democratic reform in a future liberated kuwait kuwaiti activists 
were demanding a westernstyle parliament when iraq invaded 
newspapers in cairo reported that police had arrested dozens of 
arabs and egyptian moslem extremists in their investigation of the 
assassination of parliament speaker rifaat elmahgoub on friday 
they said they included at least 25 palestinians and iraqis 
egypt has been a key arab participant in the multinational 
military force standing up to saddam in the persian gulf but iraq 
denied any involvement in the killing of elmahgoub his driver and 
four security men 
iran and iraq have reopened embassies in each others capitals 
resuming diplomatic relations after a decade of hostility irans 
official islamic republic news agency reported sunday 
the iraqi charge daffaires took up his post sunday and his 
iranian counterpart was to leave for baghdad shortly the agency 
said 
the exchange comes two years after a unbrokered ceasefire 
halted hostilities in the eightyear iraniraq war which by 
conservative estimates resulted in more than a million casualties 
tehran has officially condemned saddams aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait and called for his withdrawal but it has also condemned the 
buildup of western forces in saudi arabia since the invasion 
saddam is believed to be seeking iranian help in circumventing 
the un embargo imposed to force him out of kuwait food shipments 
are reported to have reached iraq from iran across the countries 
730mile border some sources say iran has agreed to trade refined 
oil for food 
a soviet news agency reported sunday that saddam indicated to a 
visiting soviet official last week that he might be willing to 
remove his troops from kuwait if he is allowed to keep certain real 
estate 
the agency named the lands as the kuwaiti section of the 
rumaillah oilfield which straddles the kuwaitiiraq border and 
warba and bubiyan islands near the iraqi border and just off the 
kuwaiti coast in the gulf 
an editor at the official iraqi news agency denied sunday that 
iraq had made any such offer 
the soviet governmentrun novosti press agency in a dispatch 
published sunday by the labor newspaper rabochaya tribuna said 
saddam made the comments in talks with yevgeny primakov a top 
kremlin aide 
saddam claimed when he invaded kuwait that the emirate was 
stealing oil that belonged to baghdad through vigorous 
exploitation of the rumaillah field and that kuwaits monarchy 
was illegitimate 
he was also known before the invasion to have his sights on 
warba and bubiyan which would provide iraq with key sea links 
saddam has also linked a gulf settlement to israeli withdrawal 
from territories claimed by the palestinians 
plo chairman yasser arafat said sunday that saddam was showing a 
certain flexibility regarding his claims to kuwait and urged 
all parties in the gulf crisis to follow suit 
arafat spoke at a news conference in tunis after visiting 
bagdhad he did not elaborate

prime minister lee kuan yew of singapore lashed 
out at the media today blaming television for the bloody crackdown 
on chinas prodemocracy movement and the western press for the 
fluctuations in hong kongs stock exchange 
lee also defended his countrys rigid restrictions on foreign 
media accusing newspapers such as the asian wall street journal 
of interfering in singapores domestic politics 
in a related development dow jones amp co the majority owners 
of asian wall street journal announced that it was halting 
circulation of the newspaper in singapore because of new 
restrictions on the foreign press 
lee made his comments in a speech before the commonwealth press 
union which comprises more than 500 newspapers news agencies and 
periodicals in 30 countries of the british commonwealth 
he said chinas students who took to the streets by the 
hundreds of thousands in the spring of 1989 were seduced by 
television into believing they could change china 
i believe it is this contextless television experience that 
led to the tragedy of tiananmen on june 4 he said 
on that day soldiers marched on beijing and crushed the 
movement by driving thousands of students from tiananmen square 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed 
lee said students in china for years had watched chinese news 
reports on demonstrations in the philippines and student protests 
in south korea 
chinas students forgot that china was a very different 
country from either the philippines or south korea two countries 
with close links to the united states where the media and congress 
wield immense influence he said 
lee also criticized the students for not compromising with 
chinas hardline leaders 
if they had been patient and circumspect they could have 
contributed over 10 years to the gradual opening up of the system 
which had already started he said 
lee was to travel to beijing on tuesday his fifth visit since 
1976 china and singapore normalized relations in august 
in his speech lee also blasted the foreign press in hong kong 
for trying to foist western values on the british colony 
he blamed the foreign press for causing large drops on hong 
kongs stock market which was rocked by the tiananmen killings 
much of the gyrations could have been lessened if the 
western press based in hong kong had not crusaded for their vision 
of democracy in hong kong he said 
hong kong reverts to chinese rule in 1997 and many in the 
territory fear that beijing will not keep its promise to maintain 
the colonys freewheeling political and economic system for 50 
years following the takeover 
lee did not define what he meant by foreign press but it 
appeared he was referring to dow jones asian wall street journal 
and its far eastern economic review the two englishlanguage 
publications have been the sharpest critics in the territory of 
both china and britain in the runup to 1997 
the 67yearold prime minister has had a running battle with 
both publications and has often accused them of interfering in 
singapores internal affairs 
lee said the journals move to stop circulating asian wall 
street journal in singapore was of little consequence singapore 
already restricts the journals circulation to 400 copies a day 
one of singapores new press restrictions requires foreign 
publications to post a security deposit to pay for legal fees and 
fines should the government take them to court

light in the absence of any important us economic indicators 
scheduled for the day

expected to remain light throughout the day 
they said the markets prevailing mood remained bearish on the

continuing uncertainty over the terms of the budgetdeficit 
reduction pact and notions that the us federal reserve will ease 
its monetary policy a bit to stimulate growth 
the fundamentals still look bad said a dealer with a large

the government of president elias hrawi 
moved today to reunify beirut by dismantling the green line that 
has long split the lebanese capital into moslem and christian 
sectors 
the army command of gen emile lahoud ordered military police to 
stop lawlessness by some leftist and moslem militias that moved 
into the enclave of defeated gen michel aoun in the christian 
heartland outside the city 
syrian and lebanese troops crushed aouns 11month mutiny in an 
airandground assault saturday that left 160 people dead and more 
than 800 wounded aoun took refuge in the french embassy 
aoun 55 remained in the french embassy today while lebanon and 
france argued over french efforts to move him to exile in france 
france has been the traditional protector of lebanons christians 
hrawis government said it would not allow aouns departure 
until he faces charges including the theft of 75 million from the 
state treasury 
lebanese army engineering units started dismantling mines from 
earth mounds along the fivemile green line which stretches from 
beirut port to the foothills of the central mountains in the 
southeast 
the green line has divided beirut into moslem and christian 
sectors since the outbreak of the civil war 15 years ago 
it also was dismantled in the early days of former president 
amin gemayels term in office which started in september 1982 and 
the capital was reunited for 16 months 
however moslem and leftist gunmen regained their positions 
along the same line when they ousted gemayels christianled army 
from beiruts moslem sector in a bloody confrontation in february 
1984 
a police spokesman said bulldozers would remove earth mounds and 
other barricades along the green line after the army eliminated the 
mines 
the line is expected to be totally dismantled in a week or so 
the police spokesman said 
dismantling it would be the first step by the government to 
achieve the creation of a militiafree greater beirut 
the target is an area extending 22 miles along the mediterranean 
coast from the dog river in the north to the damour river in the 
south and covering the capitals immediate suburbs at the foothills 
of the central mountain range in the east 
security sources said syrian soldiers were questioning at least 
six of aouns top lieutenants at the lebanese defense ministry 
which had been controlled by aoun before saturday 
lahouds command said in a communique that a military police 
battalion had been ordered to enforce law and order in the 
80squaremile enclave in the christian heartland 
several christian leaders complained that leftist and moslem 
militias moved in behind the syrian troops and were involved in 
atrocities against the population 
the police spokesman said leftist militiamen allied with syria 
and shiite gunmen from the proiranian hezbollah were involved in 
kidnapping looting and other atrocities 
aouns fall tightened syrias hold on lebanon which the syrians 
consider their strategic backyard syria the main power broker in 
lebanon sent 40000 troops into the country under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate 
the capital has been divided into christian and moslem sectors 
since outbreak of the civil war in 1975 
aoun had rejected an arab leaguebrokered peace plan to end the 
war and refused to recognize hrawi as head of state calling him a 
syrian puppet the peace plan provides for the traditionally 
dominant christians to share power with the moslem majority

the dollar dived against the japanese yen in tokyo 
today as investors became more pessimistic about the us economy 
traders said 
the dollar closed at 12815 yen down 115 yen from fridays 
close of 12930 yen it opened at 12855 yen and ranged between 
12795 and 12872 
the dollars closing was its lowest since 12763 yen on march 6 
1989 
the dollar has become less attractive because of growing 
pessimism over the us economic performance said a mitsubishi 
bank dealer speaking on condition of anonymity 
early dollarselling in tokyo followed the us currencys 
decline in the sydney market which opens earlier than tokyos 
dealers said 
first the yen soared against the australian dollar in early 
trading triggered by the australian central banks announcement it 
would lower interest rates said mamoru tabata a dealer with the 
mitsui taiyo kobe bank 
the us dolla will quickly fall further once it breaks the 
128yen line which is a resistance point tabata added 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno told a news conference 
however that the market sees little possibility of the dollar 
plunging he said the us currencys recent sharp drop has been 
too fast 
mieno also said there had been unavoidable stock price declines 
reflecting a correction of the bubble effect of asset prices 
the tokyo markets leading index has declined this year from a 
record high exceeding 38900 points at the end of 1989 
but on the stock exchange today the 225issue nikkei stock 
average surged 71904 points or 321 percent closing at 
2310920 the index fell 19547 points friday 
traders said the yens strength stability in bond prices and 
relative calm in the persian gulf region contributed to todays 
surge in the nikkei 
they said however that trading was thin with many investors 
sitting on the sidelines first section volume was estimated at 350 
million shares up slightly from last fridays 320 million 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
government bonds was 8340 points at 5 pm up from fridays

prosecutors have taken the rare 
step of charging a motorist with manslaughter in the death of his 
6yearold son in a car crash because the boy wasnt wearing a seat 
belt 
the point is to be made to all parents that it is your 
responsibility that your child is seat belted in no matter how 
much they fight kick scream said pamela davisspringer deputy 
district attorney 
walter g sylvia jr 49 of acton was driving his son michael 
to school aug 8 when he lost control of the car on a winding road 
authorities said the car flipped twice and the boy was thrown 
out he died an hour later 
authorities said that sylvia was going too fast and that a seat 
belt would have saved the boys life under state law children 
must be in a safety seat or wear a seat belt 
sylvia faces arraignment thursday he could get up to a year in 
jail if convicted he was released on his own recognizance 
i dont understand why they are doing this to me he said 
i dont know what they hope to accomplish 
sylvia told officers that about 25 minutes into the trip 
michael unbuckled his seat belt to push back his seat and cover 
himself with a blanket at that moment sylvia said he lost 
control of his car

since he came to power five years ago mikhail s 
gorbachev has presided over sweeping changes in his country and the 
world that perhaps even he could not have predicted 
he sounded a clarion call for reducing global tension and led 
the way toward treaties slashing conventional and nuclear forces 
he withdrew soviet troops from afghanistan freed the soviet press 
and created more powerful legislative bodies in the soviet union 
gorbachev won the nobel peace prize today for the profound 
changes he has encouraged 
but did he envision that his reforms would also lead to the rout 
of communist regimes in eastern europe and demands for at least 
some degree of independence by all 15 soviet republics 
did he realize that his halting steps toward economic reform 
would create near chaos in which the soviet people would enter the 
winter of 199091 facing shortages of such staples as bread 
potatoes and gasoline 
was the turnaround begun in april 1985 warranted gorbachev 
himself asked in a keynote address opening the 28th congress of the 
soviet communist party on july 2 
the party under his leadership he said must bear direct 
responsibility for the worsening of the situation on the consumer 
market which has complicated the entire situation in the 
country 
in that speech his most recent state of the union address 
he admitted successes and failures implicitly acknowledging that 
although his popularity remains high outside the soviet union he 
faces increasing trouble maintaining the support of his people 
despite unrest gorbachevs grip on power appears firm this 
year he was elected to a fiveyear term in the newly strengthened 
post of president and in july he was resoundingly reelected to 
head the communist party 
the course of his reforms which he has dubbed perestroika 
has appeared to zigzag at times but in the political sphere at 
least the progress has been relentless 
at a landmark communist party conference in 1988 gorbachev 
allowed senior party leaders to come under unprecedented public 
criticism spurring public debate over key issues 
in march 1990 the soviet union held the most democratic 
elections in its history and many communist party candidates were 
defeated in balloting for the newly created congress of peoples 
deputies 
the nation sat riveted to television coverage of the congress 
as deputies debated the future of the country then elected a 
president gorbachev and a 542member supreme soviet 
legislature 
early this year the country crossed another threshold erasing 
from the constitution the phrase guaranteeing the communist party 
monopoly on power 
but gorbachev has hesitated on moving his country from central 
economic planning to a marketbased system 
now there is economic confusion in which farmers and factories 
are not making required deliveries to state stores 
today the soviet people will no longer put up with what they 
uncomplainingly endured in the past gorbachev said in his july 
speech 
after april 1985 we told the people the truth rejected false 
conceit and admitted that we were in fact unable to provide them 
with a fitting life 
historians are asking how a leader such as gorbachev could have 
risen to power through the ranks of the traditionalist communist 
party 
one key is that gorbachevs early political consciousness was 
formed shortly after stalins 1953 death nikita khrushchev 
stalins successor accelerated the process of destalinization in 
1956 with a secret speech at the 20th party congress that 
affected an entire generation 
khrushchev was ousted in 1964 and replaced by leonid i 
brezhnev who reversed many of the reforms and is now blamed by 
gorbachev for what is called the period of stagnation 
gorbachev and others of his mindset laid low for decades and 
there is little in his biography hinting at the type of reformer he 
has become 
he was born in 1931 in the village of privolnoye in the 
stavropol region on the northern flank of the caucasus mountains in 
the russian republic his speech still reflects the soft gs of 
what in russia is considered a southern accent 
one of his grandfathers was arrested during stalins forced 
collectivization of agriculture in 192932 he has told 
interviewers and the experience apparently left its mark 
gorbachev enrolled in moscow state university as a law student 
in 1950 two years later he became a full member of the communist 
party and was active in the komsomol the partys youth 
organization 
while in moscow he met his future wife raisa maximovna 
titorenko also from stavropol 
gorbachev returned to stavropol in 1955 as a komsomol activist 
rising to komsomol first secretary in the region in 1960 
a year later he was appointed communist party first secretary 
in the city of stavropol and in 1966 was elevated to full 
membership in the national communist party central committee 
as party leader in stavropol gorbachev became acquainted with 
top party leaders visiting the regions resorts he is said to have 
particularly impressed mikhail suslov the kremlin ideologist and 
yuri andropov head of the kgb 
gorbachevs big career leap came in 1978 when he was moved to 
moscow and appointed central committee secretary in charge of 
agriculture in 1979 he was named a candidate or nonvoting 
member of the ruling politburo headed by brezhnev and became a 
full member a year later 
gorbachevs future looked bright when andropov succeeded 
brezhnev as party leader in late 1982 but his mentor died in arly 
1984 and was succeeded by the traditionalist konstantin u 
chernenko a foe 
the ailing chernenko sought to diminish gorbachevs chances of 
succeeding him but died just more than a year after taking office 
gorbachev succeeded him on march 11 1985

maybe there was something amiss in the hiss 
maybe it was viperous vibes 
whatever the serpentine signal he received tom robertson jr 
deemed things were not as they ssssssssseemed 
robertson 36 a selftaught snake expert and former zoo 
employee walked into a pet store on new york citys upper west 
side about a week ago to buy some fish food 
when he glanced at a tank that supposedly held harmless garter 
snakes he recognized similarlooking asian water snakes known as 
redneck keelbacks the snakes bite in rare instances can be 
fatal 
i told a guy in the store said robertson he said he knew 
they werent poisonous i told him i could bring them some proof 
he got real arrogant i brought back a book but they still didnt 
believe me i called the police the aspca fish and wildlife 
i called a lot of places trying to find out what to do 
finally someone at the city health department took him 
seriously 
the departments inspectors called a new york university 
biologist who confirmed robertsons suspicions 
the inspectors learned that a wholesaler had sold petland 
discount stores about 50 supposedly harmless snakes and that some 
had been distributed to the chains 50 stores in the metropolitan 
area 
the health department issued a public warning about the snakes 
friday and is investigating the matter 
they believe me now said robertson who received 
congratulations friday from neighbors and relatives 
since friday the american society for the prevention of cruelty 
to animals has picked up at least five snakes from pet owners who 
called for help two were venomous two were not it was unclear 
whether the fifth one was 
in addition 14 venomous snakes were removed from stores and 
taken to the zoo 
redneck keelbacks are not usually aggressive but a bite can be 
fatal if untreated health department spokesman peter lynn said 
the orangy snakes are about 18 inches long and about as big 
around as your pinky bronx zoo spokeswoman marilynn levine 
said 
robertson whos unemployed has worked for pet store 
wholesalers and for two years at a seattle zoo he owns about 50 
snake books 
he says hes not scared of snakes even though any time you 
handle them you have it in the back of your mind that they might 
bite 
respect he said is the key 
hes snakeless right now but hes owned more than 200 king 
snakes albino rat snakes boa constrictors pythons since he was 
8 years old 
still he concedes that theyre not the cleverest of pets 
you cant train them or teach them tricks

composercritic virgil thomson once said bernstein rose 
vertically a la nijinsky and hovered there a good 15 seconds 
new york times critic harold schonberg wrote 
bernstein maintained that conductors should be actors 
i dont mean that when the music is tragic youve got to act 
like barrymore in hamlet he said but you have to indicate 
to the orchestra by your body and your face which is all youve 
got what the shape of the phrase is 
born in lawrence mass bernstein he pronounced his name the 
germanic way bernstine got a relatively late start in music he 
was 10 before his aunt clara gave the family an upright piano

americanborn director in 1969 he gave up his post to devote more 
time to composition 
he first of all educated a whole generation in america with 
his televised educational concerts and as the music director of 
the new york philharmonic hundreds of recordings have become a 
household item in every music lovers home said zubin mehta 
music director of the israel philharmonic orchestra in tel aviv 
lenny had the magic touch almost anybody he conducted he 
popularized said morton gould president of the american society

a former kgb double agent has identified the 
longsecret fifth man in a notorious soviet spy ring as john 
cairncross a former british intelligence officer 
oleg gordievsky a career kgb agent who worked for the british 
as a double agent before escaping to the west in 1985 disclosed 
the mans identity in kgb the inside story a new book 
excerpted today in the times newspaper it was written with 
christopher andrew a cambridge university historian 
the identity of the fifth man has been speculated for years 
and a number of people have been suspected including cairncross 
gordievsky said cairncross played an important part in the spy 
ring led by harold kim philby and including guy burgess donald 
maclean and anthony blunt 
philby said to be the most damaging double agent in british 
history spied for the soviets for 26 years until he defected to 
moscow in 1963 philby rose to become head of the antisoviet 
section of m16 the british service responsible for gathering 
foreign intelligence 
all went to cambridge university and it was there that blunt 
spotted cairncross and burgess recruited him the excerpt from the 
book says 
although cairncross is the last of the five to be publicly 
identified he successfully penetrated a greater variety of the 
corridors of power and intelligence than any of the other four 
according to the book which is to be published friday in the 
united states and britain 
the excerpt quotes kgb officer dmitri svetanko as saying 
cairncrosss achievements were the equal of any of the five 
except philby 
cairncross was a spy working before and during world war ii in 
the foreign office the treasury and the office of a government 
minister the excerpt said he also worked for britains electronic 
eavesdropping center and for mi6 according to the section of the 
book printed in the times 
until the end of world war ii when philbys career began to 
take off i think he provided more important intelligence than any 
of the others andrew told the associated press 
the times said the scottishborn cairncross confessed to the mi5 
counterintelligence service in 1964 he now lives in the south of 
france and is the only member of the spy ring still alive 
this is not a new discovery labor party legislator ted 
leadbitter said on sunday this has been known for an awfully 
long time 
the times said cairncrosss involvement with soviet intelligence 
has been well documented but he had never been placed in the same 
category as the other four cairncross always claimed he was just 
a small fish the newspaper said 
former mi5 officer peter wright had said former mi5 head sir 
roger hollis was the fifth man of the philby ring earlier this 
year gordievsky said in a bbc television interview that hollis 
who ran the counterespionage service from 1956 to 1965 was not a 
soviet agent 
gordievskys 700page book details kgb involvement in the 
shooting down of the korean airlines flight 007 in 1983 
gordievsky began working for the british while posted in 
copenhagen denmark in the early 1970s 
the kgb soviet intelligence service sent him to london but he 
was recalled to moscow and questioned about his activities he 
eluded a kgb tail and escaped to the west his 1985 defection 
sparked a retaliatory expulsion of 31 soviet and 31 british 
diplomats trade representatives and journalists

the incoming chairman of the new york stock 
exchange attacked the materialism of the 1980s in a sermon at the 
worlds largest cathedral 
william h donaldson who takes over jan 1 said the last 
decade was a time when it was easy to see how good things were 
for some people and even easier to not see how bad things had 
become for others 
donaldsons guest appearance as a preacher sunday at the 
cathedral of st john the divine stemmed from a rally last may when 
mayor david dinkins asked civic leaders to work together to improve 
the city 
donaldson 59 a securities industry veteran is a friend of 
president bush and the fourth fulltime paid chairman of the new 
york stock exchange he and two friends founded donaldson lufkin 
and jenrette the nations 10thlargest brokerage he also served 
in the nixon and ford administrations 
despite his success and power in the business world donaldson 
told the congregation that the prospect of preaching had given him 
the jitters 
in fact he said he was so nervous that the occasion conjured 
up memories of himself as a little boy in a blue suit asked to 
read the scriptures in buffalo new york all sweaty palms and 
shaky knees 
on january 1 when i pass through those worldly portals on 11 
wall street my first day will seem like a piece of cake 
during his 25minute sermon donaldson said it should not be 
left to the captains of industry and government to reverse the tide 
of selfishness and greed 
it is a spirit that must spring from the individual not the 
employee manual he said 
donaldsons sermon was the first of a series of weekly sermons 
dedicated to what church officials call sharing visions

republican gubernatorial candidate jon 
grunseth is accused in sworn affidavits of encouraging four girls 
aged 13 to 16 to join him for a nude swim at a 1981 pool party 
according to a newspaper report today 
the statements were made by liane nelson now 23 and a social 
worker dealing with sexual abuse cases in the boston area and her 
cousin elizabeth mulay 22 of san jose calif the star tribune 
reported today 
the two women said grunseth also encouraged his daughter nina 
to swim in the nude at the fourth of july party at his home 
nina grunseth denied the charges in her own affidavit and her 
father said supporters of democratic gov rudy perpich were trying 
to blackmail him into dropping his campaign 
i regard this as an absolute outrage grunseth told the star 
tribune but what is going on here im convinced beyond any 
doubt is a creation of the perpich camp were three weeks before 
the election and all of a sudden out of the clear blue there are 
charges that are being dropped on us about something that happened 
nine or 10 years ago that no one has ever heard of 
nelson 14 at the time of the party said she decided to speak 
out nine years later because she believes there was sexual 
impropriety at the party 
i think that is extremely inappropriate behavior for someone 
who wants to be governor she told the star tribune 
according to the affidavits from nelson and mulay two other 
teenage girls in the pool including nina grunseth removed their 
swimsuits at grunseths urging grunseth and one or more of his 
adult male friends also took off their suits nelson and mulay 
said 
he suggested we all take our swimsuits off mulay said my 
cousin and i were adamant about not taking them off at one 
point grunseth cornered me in the pool i tried to swim by but 
he blocked me in 
mulay said grunseth at one point tried to touch one of her 
breasts 
i became afraid and swam under his arms and got away i was 
very angry and got right out of the pool her statement said 
nina grunseth in an affidavit prepared friday said i 
believe the allegation against my father is totally untrue i know 
my father and i do not believe under any circumstances he 
committed the act of which he is accused or any similar act 
grunseth who was 35 at the time and a businessman described 
his 1981 party as a wellattended wholesome event 
on sunday he sent a letter to perpich saying he holds the 
governor responsible for the allegations 
they are lies and i will not tolerate them i will not 
succumb to blackmail the star tribune quoted grunseth as 
writing 
perpich said he had no previous knowledge of the allegations 
ive had no part in it perpich said

president mikhail s gorbachev said today the 1990 
nobel peace prize was not a personal honor but an award for 
perestroika the reform program that has revolutionized the 
nations foreign and domestic policies 
words fail one at such moments i am moved gorbachev told 
soviet and foreign reporters at the kremlin 
he said he received news of the prize first of all not in 
personal terms but as recognition of the significance of the 
immense cause of perestroika 
tass quoted the soviet leader as saying when we were starting 
our perestroika we knew that it would have vast significance to 
all countries 
gorbachev said he will go to oslo to personally accept the 
award 
earlier word spread at the supreme soviet of gorbachevs win

anatoly dobrynin the former soviet ambassador to the united 
states were among those at the legislature when reporters learned 
of the announcement in oslo 
dobrynin said he welcomed the award for gorbachev 
asked what effect it might have on gorbachev and international 
politics dobrynin said i think very favorable both ways 
he declined to say specifically what effect the prize may have 
describing the award as an approval of gorbachevs international 
policies which i think have been mostly approved by my soviet 
society and world society 
abroad gorbachev has been popular for working to end the cold 
war and for allowing revolutions in many east bloc countries his 
position at home has been tenuous because of a worsening economy 
and waning of communist party power and it was unclear how winning 
the peace prize would affect his standing 
ligachev one of gorbachevs key conservative rivals dashed 
from the parliament building shortly after the word spread of the 
award answering with only one word to reporters asking his 
reaction positive he said 
there was practically no public speculation in moscow about 
gorbachevs chances of winning the prize in the days before the 
prize was announced 
the official news agency tass waited nearly 40 minutes to move a 
oneline urgent story on todays announcement datelined oslo the 
tass story said soviet president mikhail gorbachev won the 1990 
nobel peace prize the norwegian parliaments nobel committee 
announced today 
the award was not announced inside the supreme soviet chamber 
and most of the deputies and dignitaries there were unaware he had 
won for at least half an hour after word reached reporters 
yelena bonner wife of late human rights activist andrei 
sakharov who was awarded a nobel prize while in internal soviet 
exile today refused comment on the news that gorbachev had won 
since coming to power in march 1985 gorbachev has presided over 
sweeping changes in his country and the world 
he sounded a clarion call for reducing global tension and led 
the way toward treaties slashing conventional and nuclear forces 
he withdrew soviet troops from afghanistan freed the soviet 
press and created more powerful legislative bodies in the soviet 
union 
in oslo the nobel committee chairman gidske anderson cited 
the greater openness he has brought to soviet society a 
slowing in the arms race and the freedom of eastern europen 
nations 
gorbachevs reforms have led to the rout of communist regimes 
from eastern europe they also have been accompanied by bloody 
ethnic conflicts in armenia azerbaijan and central asia and have 
prompted secession drives by the three baltic republics and 
declarations of independence or sovereignty by most of the 
remaining 12 soviet republics including russia the largest

chancellor helmut kohls party swept to victory in 
state elections in eastern germany final results indicated today 
solidifying its power just seven weeks before germany holds its 
first nationwide balloting 
as a result of sundays conservative victory in four of the five 
new eastern states the opposition social democrats appeared likely 
to lose their thin majority in the upper house of parliament they 
conceded the losses hurt their chances to unseat kohls government 
in the parliamentary election dec 2 
it doesnt appear as if were headed into any shining or 
glorious victory but it is still not the reason to give up said 
reinhard klimmt the campaign manager for kohls social democrat 
challenger oskar lafontaine klimmt spoke in an interview today 
with saarland state radio 
kohl told television sunday night the dec 2 elections have 
not been won the results will come on dec 2 but we are in a good 
starting position 
kohls party leads a coalition that already controls the more 
powerful lower house of parliament or bundestag representation in 
the legislationreviewing upper house or bundesrat is based on 
parties electoral performance in statewide elections 
sundays vote was seen as a prelude to nationwide parliamentary 
elections on dec 2 the first united german vote in 60 years and 
the fourth this year in what was still east germany just weeks ago 
results showed the social democrats defeating the christian 
democrats only in brandenburg state where kohls strength could 
not carry the unpopular conservative candidate the social 
democrats got 388 percent of the vote in brandenburg to 293 
percent for the christian democrats and 128 percent for the 
renamed communist party 
the results showed the christian democrats won a majority in 
saxony 
they also won the most votes in thuringia saxonyanhalt and 
mecklenburglower pomerania and were expected to form a coalition 
with the centrist free democrats to hold a majority in those three 
states 
the turnout in the five states that used to be east germany 
ranged from 65 percent to 735 percent of the 115 million eligible 
voters 
elections were also held sunday in the former west german state 
of bavaria where the christian socialists sister party in kohls 
coalition retained their absolute majority 
kohl the politician most credited with uniting germany on oct 
3 is favored in the december elections 
the social democrats have criticized kohls party for the speed 
and cost of unification their own program calls primarily for 
better environmental protection 
kohl had campaigned extensively on behalf of conservative 
candidates in sundays elections which gave eastern germans state 
legislatures and ended decades of centralized communist control 
concerns among eastern germans about their economic security as 
their homeland converts to capitalism from a planned system 
dominated the brief election campaign 
the merger with richer west germany has left east germans 
swimming in an economy now riddled with unemployment higher prices 
and uncompetetive industries 
the renamed communists who ruled east germany for 40 years 
seemed set to win seats in state legislatures a sign of support

iraq issued a stern warning to the united 
states and its allies today saying israel and other strongholds 
of conspiracy would be crushed if iraq were attacked 
the statement in the newspaper of the ruling baath party comes 
amid speculation in baghdad that iraq will be attacked within three 
weeks it appeared intended to counter suggestions that president 
saddam hussein was showing signs of flexibility on the annexation 
of kuwait 
the editorial in the althawra newspaper said iraqis are 
prepared to meet the american troops 
if they start the war we will make it a catastrophe for those 
who ignite it the editorial said the destruction will be 
total especially considering that israel is within the range of 
an alhijara missile and all other strongholds of conspiracy and 
aggression will be crushed 
alhijara arabic for the stones is the name of an iraqi 
missile that saddam first described on oct 9 the day after at 
least 19 palestinian stonethrowers were killed in jerusalem by 
israeli policemen saddam said the missile could hit targets 
hundreds of miles away 
the reference to other strongholds of conspiracy apparently 
meant saudi arabia and other arab countries participating in the 
usled multinational force that assembled in the persian gulf 
region after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
initially the stated purpse of those forces was to defend 
saudi arabia but there have been indications some western leaders 
are losing patience and are considering a military attack to 
dislodge iraq from kuwait exiled kuwaiti officials have encouraged 
that course 
we will make them be sorry for listening to the advice of 
their little stooges in the area althawra said all the 
american interests and those of its allies inside and outside the 
region will explode and the fires will eat them at the first hour 
of their aggression against iraq 
the language seemed aimed at countering suggestions that saddam 
might be softening on his refusal to withdraw from kuwait 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat said 
sunday that saddam was showing a certain flexibility regarding 
his claims to kuwait and urged all countries involved in the gulf 
crisis to follow suit 
the remark came in tunis where arafat met with foreign minister 
roland dumas of france 
diplomatic sources in baghdad said arafat who met with saddam 
earlier sunday is trying to persuade the iraqis to talk with the 
french who have made it clear they believe iraqs withdrawal from 
kuwait might be linked to an israeli withdrawal from the west bank 
and gaza strip 
saddam said aug 12 that he would negotiate on a withdrawal from 
kuwait only if negotiations also were held on the palestinian 
issue 
in moscow the governmentrun novosti press agency also reported 
saddam showed signs of softening his position the agency said 
saddam indicated to soviet envoy yevgeny primakov recently that he 
might remove his troops in exchange for some kuwaiti territory 
along the gulf 
but iraqs first deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan 
said on sunday that iraq is prepared to confront whatever 
happens in holding kuwait 
and foreign minister tariq aziz visiting morocco said in 
the light of this crime in jerusalem the arab nation has a great 
responsibility to say the clear word not to agree on dealing with 
two faces

leftwing israeli parties today said they would 
challenge the cabinets decision not to cooperate with a un team 
investigating the shooting deaths of at least 19 palestinians by 
israeli police 
the cabinet on sunday called the un mission unacceptable 
and said the delegation should stay away from israel the decision 
defied not only the united nations but its chief ally the united 
states 
israel took on the united states on a second issue announcing a 
new housing plan that ignores american pleas not to settle newly 
arrived soviet immigrants in territory captured in the 1967 middle 
east war 
the main opposition labor party was expected to support the 
leftwing challenge to the cabinet decision during debate today in 
the opening fall session of the knesset or parliament legislators 
said 
even with labor support the motion will have a difficult time 
overcoming the 62seat majority of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing coalition in the 120member parliament but shamirs 
hold could be weakened by arguments with shas an ultraorthodox 
religious party 
labor and small leftwing parties have 54 votes in parliament 
amnon rubinstein head of the small shinui party said he 
believed the cabinet decision was a mistake since it would isolate 
israel from the united states and the world community 
it is a response that will damage israels relations with her 
friends overseas will weaken her influence in the united states 
and would exclude her from the concensus which the western family 
of nations has constructed against iraqi president saddam 
hussein rubinstein said 
the labor party also has urged lowlevel police and city 
officials to cooperate with un envoys so israels side would be 
heard 
cabinet officials made it clear that they expect the un three 
investigators to stay away although it appeared no move was taken 
to block their arrival this is not an invitation to come its 
an invitation not to come said deputy foreign minister benyamin 
netanyahu 
the un security council voted unanimously friday to condemn 
the deaths of the palestinians in police gunfire on oct 8 on 
jerusalems temple mount known in arabic as haram alsharif and 
revered by jews and moslems 
in a rare gesture the united states joined in the censure of 
its ally agreeing to a resolution calling for the dispatch to 
jerusalem of a threemember delegation to investigate the 
shootings 
the temple mount riot began when palestinians threw rocks onto 
worshipers praying below at the western wall judaisms holiest 
site police first used tear gas and rubber bullets then live 
ammunition 
israels cabinet at its regular weekly session sunday said it 
saw no reason for the united nations to intervene when it had 
ignored worse incidents in other countries 
the israeli daily yedioth ahronoth reported that secretary of 
state james a baker iii sent a message urging israel to accept the 
un team saying a refusal could further distract world attention 
from international efforts to solve the persian gulf crisis 
israel set up its own inquiry into the shootings on friday the 
investigating commission is led by former mossad spy chief zvi 
zamir and is only empowered o make recommendations 
israel maintains its police were provoked by the barrage of 
stones thrown at jews at the western wall also known as the 
wailing wall 
an israeli human rights group on sunday accused police of 
indiscriminate shooting and criminal negligence in the 
bloodshed the group betselem said the government has attempted 
to hide the facts mislead the public and evade 
responsibility in the shootings 
foreign minister david levy said israels stand against the 
united nations could strain ties with the united states the 
situation now is difficult one mustnt take it lightly 
the cabinets response gave vent to israels frustration at 
coming under strong criticism at a time when civilians are being 
issued gas masks to cope with iraqs threats to attack with 
chemical weapons the army started handing out the defense kits 
last week in three towns and planned to widen distribution to all 
cities including arab villages beginning today 
the temple mount clash was the bloodiest of a 34month 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of lands seized in 
the 1967 middle east war moslems revere the site as the place 
where the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven 
it is the jews holiest site and the location of the western 
wall or wailing wall remnant of their biblical temple 
the temple mount shootings have shifted the focus of the 
palestinian uprising from the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 
jerusalem home to 350000 jews and 150000 palestinian arabs 
on sunday night the israeli government announced plans for a 
building campaign throughout jerusalem to dramatize its claims to 
the city 
the committee on immigration decided to build about 5000 
apartments in the coming year and to ask the cabinet to approve 
incentives to contractors and soviet immigrants said absorption 
ministry spokeswoman ida benshitreet 
mrs benshitreet said housing would go up in eight 
neighborhoods six of them in predominantly arab east jerusalem 
which israel captured in 1967 and later annexed 
the decision comes despite us requirements that israel avoid 
settling soviet newcomers in occupied territories or east 
jerusalem these were conditions of a 400 million loan guarantee 
approved by congress this month

a former air force sergeant convicted of 
aggravated assault because he engaged in homosexual conduct while 
knowingly infected with an aidsrelated virus lost a supreme court 
appeal today 
the justices without comment let stand nathaniel johnson jrs 
conviction dishonorable military discharge and sixyear prison 
sentence 
johnson was stationed at mcchord air force base in washington 
state when in 1987 he tested positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv which is believed to cause acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome or aids 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections no one is known to have recovered from aids 
a person who like johnson tests positive for hiv has a 20 to 
30 percent change of developing aids over a fiveyear period 
according to the federal centers for disease control 
johnson was sent to the wilford hall medical center at lackland 
air force base in texas for evaluation and treatment and while 
there received counseling on safe sex practices 
johnson remained a patient at wilford hall until october 1987 
about two weeks after the air force adopted a policy that held out 
the possibility of disciplinary action for hivinfected military 
members who did not practice safe sex 
lawyers for johnson say he never was told about the policy 
after returning to mcchord johnson engaged in homosexual 
conduct with a 17yearold boy he had met in a tacoma bar 
the two kissed and johnson performed fellatio on the youth a 
military judge also found that johnson had attempted to have anal 
intercourse with the youth johnson did not tell the boy about his 
hiv infection 
tried by general courtmartial at mcchord in early 1988 johnson 
was convicted of consensual sodomy by fellatio he also was 
convicted of aggravated assault and attempted sodomy both premised 
on the act of attempted consensual anal intercourse he was 
sentenced to 10 years in prison 
the us air force court of military review threw out the 
attempted consenual sodomy conviction after ruling that the charge 
essentially duplicated the aggravated assault charge 
the court reduced johnsons sentence to six years and its 
ruling was upheld by the us court of military appeals last april 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for johnson said the 
portion of the uniform code of military justice used to prosecute 
him for aggravated assault is impermissibly vague when applied to 
the possible transmission of a virus 
they said the offense of aggravated assault never was intended 
to be used against someone accused of transmitting a contagious 
disease unless there is a clear intent to spread the disease 
the appeal added our society is clearly inflamed with 
hysteria over the hiv epidemic we cannot allow our legal system 
to be improperly used as a tool for the further prosecution of hiv 
carriers 
the case is johnson vs us 9061

two policemen from a small town in illinois 
who say they were disciplined unlawfully for wearing earrings when 
off duty lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment rejected arguments that peotone 
ill officials violated the two officers constitutional right to 
make a fashion statement while on their own time 
marvin rathert and gary zybak contend they have a right 
protected by the 14th amendments bar on deprivations of 
liberty without due process to wear any jewelry they choose 
including an ear stud when not on the job 
but the 7th us circuit court of appeals in rejecting that 
contention last june said the peotone police officers are 
members of a small community there is little difference in the 
way the villages police officers are publicly viewed whether 
they wear the ear stud on duty or off 
peotone is a village of fewer than 5000 residents 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1976 decision in which the 
supreme court upheld a police forces hairlength regulations for 
all policemen 
but in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the two policemen 
said the 1976 ruling cannot be properly applied to a transitory 
article of personal dress that can be worn off duty and be left at 
home while on duty 
the case is rathert vs village of peotone 90349

winstonsalem nc ap a former church chorister accused of 
poisoning her two husbands and a former boyfriend is looking 
forward to telling her side of the story at the opening of her 
murder trial her attorney said 
blanche taylor moore 57 is charged with firstdegree murder in 
the oct 7 1986 arsenicpoisoning death of raymond reid he was 
her boss and later her boyfriend 
jury selection was scheduled for this afternoon in forsyth 
county superior court 
shes been anxious about all the negative little things that 
have come out in the whole 14 months since she was arrested 
said defense attorney mitchell mcentire shes had a desire to 
respond and has had no forum 
prosecutors who are seeking the death penalty have said mrs 
moore systematically poisoned reid james n taylor her first 
husband and the rev dwight moore her second over a 16year 
period only moore survived the arsenic 
when moore was hospitalized in may 1989 shortly after returning 
home from his honeymoon doctors were perplexed by his severe 
nausea and vomiting 
tests showed the burlington minister was lucky to be alive he 
had been poisoned by a near fatal dose of arsenic in his food 
hospital officials immediately notified police who began 
checking into the past of moores bride a retired grocery store 
clerk they quickly discovered that reid 50 had died three years 
earlier after a long hospital stay 
reids body was exhumed and an autopsy showed he died from 
arsenic poisoning a subsequent autopsy also found arsenic in the 
exhumed body of taylor who died of an apparent heart attack at age 
45 in 1973 
nonfatal amounts of arsenic also were found in the bodies of 
her father who died in 1966 and motherinlaw from her first 
marriage who died in 1970 no charges were filed in those cases 
earlier this month judge william freeman denied a request by 
forsyth county district attorney warren sparrow to consolidate the 
two murder charges and two assault charges in moores poisoning 
into one trial 
mrs moore a smallframed woman and a grandmother will be 
tried later on the second murder charge in taylors death and the 
assault charges 
sparrow said today that jury selection could take a week and 
that the trial itself could last up to six weeks sparrow said he 
intends to call as many as 70 witnesses 
since her arrest july 18 1989 mrs moore has been held without 
bail in the alamance county jail in graham its just a few miles 
from burlington where she had once lived a quiet life singing in 
the church choir and working at the local krogers grocery store 
she has suffered from nearly 15 months of incarceration 
said mcentire shes been stuck in a cell in the county jail and 
it has taken its toll but she has a spirit about her that remains 
very strong

the supreme court which has twice ruled that 
burning the american flag is protected political speech today set 
aside a minnesota mans flagburning conviction 
the justices told a federal appeals court to restudy a 
freespeech challenge to william c cary jrs federal conviction 
for burning an american flag during a 1988 demonstration in 
minneapolis 
in upholding carys conviction the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled he was arrested and prosecuted not for any political 
message contained in his flag burning but to prevent further 
breaches of the peace 
the nations highest court in june 1989 struck down a texas law 
and by extension similar laws in most other states barring 
desecration or destruction of the flag and the court last june 
invalidated a federal flagburning ban that had been inspired by 
the political firestorm the 1989 ruling touched off 
both decisions were reached by 54 votes 
in both nowretired justice william j brennan wrote for the 
court that government may not prohibit expression of an idea simply 
because most people find it deeply offensive 
but in carys case the 8th circuit court ruled his prosecution 
was not aimed at any expression of an idea but instead was aimed at 
conduct that could have led to violence 
in a brief order the justices set aside the appeals court 
ruling and told that court to reconsider carys case in light of 
last junes decision 
cary burned a flag during a march 18 1988 demonstration outside 
an armed services recruitment center in downtown minneapolis to 
protest president reagans policies in honduras 
some 3200 american troops had been ordered into honduras the 
previous day 
some vandalism including the breaking of windows took place 
during the demonstration but federal prosecutors never alleged 
that cary participated in that the only charge against him was 
based on the federal law against flag burning that existed at the 
time 
cary was convicted and sentenced to three months in jail 
the supreme court decision striking down the texas law was 
announced while carys appeal was pending before the 8th circuit 
court 
in ruling on carys case last february the appeals court said 
his conviction under the old federal law was not contentbased but 
tied to the governments desire to prevent further breaches of 
the peace which would likely result from the reaction of the 
vandals to carys means of communicating his message in a context 
of violence 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for cary urged the 
justices to reverse his conviction they said the conviction 
depended on the communicative impact of his conduct 
but bush administration lawyers said the conviction should 
stand 
the court below concluded that the governments interest in 
preventing breaches of the peace was implicated on the facts before 
it justice department lawyers said 
the minnesota civil liberties union in a friendofthecourt 
brief took carys side 
it contended that the 8th circuit courts ruling in carys case 
has virtually gutted the two supreme court rulings on flag 
burning by carving out a vague context of violence exception 
the case is cary vs us 905183

the 37yearold law barring 
blacks from many public facilities formally ended today and the 
african national congress urged blacks to counter rightwing 
opposition by exercising their new rights 
in another development black factional fighting broke out in a 
township east of johannesburg on sunday night police said seven 
blacks were killed at a migrant workers hostel in fighting between 
rival groups armed with pistols and knives the fighting was the 
worst incident after several weeks of relative calm in the black 
townships in the area 
the lifting of the separate amenities act which was a pillar of 
south africas apartheid system was not expected to have 
noticeable effects in major cities where segregation has eased in 
recent years 
but in smaller towns controlled by the rightwing conservative 
party a showdown was set between blacks and white authorities and 
residents opposed to the changes 
in the town of middelburg in the conservativedominated 
transvaal province residents have voted to close all public 
facilities rather than open them to all races 
other towns planned to charge fees higher than most blacks can 
afford to restrict their use of public amenities black leaders 
threatened strikes and boycotts to protest the actions 
entry to public facilities must be unconditional and free 
what these councils are planning is an illegal act of banditry 
said the ancs secretary in the eastern transvaal joe nkuna 
he said the formation of vigilante groups to keep blacks out 
would fail if people were determined to end discrimination and he 
appealed to blacks to begin using the amenities 
parliament repealed the separate amenities act in june and gave 
communities until oct 15 to comply the governing national party 
had approved the act in 1953 five years after it came to power on 
a platform advocating strict separation of the races 
since president fw de klerk took office in august 1989 
however he has instituted a number of racial reforms released 
such emminent black leaders as nelson mandela and begun talks with 
the anc to negotiate a new constition giving the black majority 
some share of power 
the socalled petty apartheid laws permitted under the separate 
amenities act barred blacks from such municipal services as public 
restrooms swimming pools spas and libraries 
the black factional fighting in kempton park township was 
between zulus and xhosas the main combatants in the recent battles 
around johannesburg that have left about 800 people dead since 
early august 
many zulus are loyal to the conservative inkatha movement while 
many xhosas and other blacks back the african national congress 
several people were wounded in sunday nights battle hospital 
officials said all the victims had bullet or stab wounds police 
said adding no arrests had been made 
the anc and inkatha also have been battling in the eastern 
province of natal since 1986 leaving about 5000 dead the two 
sides were scheduled to resume peace talks today in durban the 
largest city in natal province 
the anc and inkatha both oppose apartheid but differ on tactics 
and plans for a future south africa

the final budget plan that will emerge from 
congress will mean sharply higher taxes for upperincome americans 
majority leader george mitchell said today 
the house and senate are expected to approve rival 
deficitreduction plans this week in an effort to keep the 
government from shutting down for the second time this month 
house democrats are calling for an increase in the top rate paid 
by the wealthiest from 28 percent to 33 percent the senate 
finance committee is proposing limiting deductions that can be 
claimed by upperincome taxpayers which also would serve to 
increase taxes on the wealthy 
the administration opposes the house democratic plan which 
would require higherincome taxpayers to bear about twothirds of 
the proposed tax increase 
president bush told reporters on air force one today that he met 
this morning with minority leaders rep bob michel rill and 
sen bob dole rkan 
he said they were pretty much on the same wavelength in 
preferring the senate finance committee proposal over the house 
democratic plan 
but bush en route to texas for the first stop of a twoday 
campaign trip refused to say what he might do about taxes 
that managed to get a little confused last week so what ill 
do is to say the actions in the congress and i will take a look at 
what comes out he said weve indicated to our leaders our 
preferences 
mitchell dmaine told reporters he hoped the two versions 
could be blended to get an even more progressive tax package 
bush and congress have been negotiating for months on a 
deficitreduction plan to cut spending and increase taxes by about 
500 billion over five years 
mitchell said the burden on the rich would be considerably 
higher under the senate finance committee bill compared with a plan 
worked out among congressional leaders and the white house that 
agreement was rejected by the house 
the finance committee bill includes a 9centagallon increase 
in the tax on gasoline 
the house democratic version would forgo any increase in the 
gasoline tax relying instead on delaying an adjustment in the 
incometax brackets and personal exemptions a delay that would 
mean higher income taxes on everyone who files a return 
the governments spending authority expires at midnight friday 
and president bush has said hell veto any stopgap extension unless 
a deficit reduction is approved 
john sununu the white house staff chief said sunday the odds 
favor another shutdown next weekend 
all sides will have difficulty agreeing on a budget by then 
he said 
bush allowed nonessential federal activity to stop for three 
days over the columbus day holiday weekend after the house rejected 
a deficit reduction plan oct 5 the government resumed operating 
on the stopgap measure that expires friday 
the odds are probably relatively high the government will 
begin shutting down a second time if congress fails to approve a 
plan acceptable to the white house sununu said 
congress also is racing to complete work on a number of other 
measures including a clean air bill crime legislation the 1990 
farm bill and a civil rights measure lawmakers hope to adjourn 
sometime in the next two weeks to campaign for the nov 6 election 
later today the senate planned to take up the 268 billion 
defense spending bill for fiscal 1991 the plan trims about 1 
billion from bushs budget request for the strategic defense 
initiative but leaves intact the administrations request for the 
b2 stealth bomber it also cuts 100000 troops from the us 
worldwide troop level of 21 million 
vice president dan quayle said sunday the president is prepared 
to keep congress in session for as long as it takes to craft a 
budget plan he can accept 
both sununu and quayle attacked a plan that was passed last week 
by the democraticcontrolled house ways and means committee 
the measure which would raise the income tax on the wealthiest 
americans from 28 percent to 33 percent is expected to win 
approval from the full house a family earning more than 200000 
could see their taxes increase by 11000 under the plan 
quayle said the administration is violently opposed to the 
democratic plan while sununu said the administration was opposed 
to playing around with the income tax rate for americans across the 
board quayle appeared on cbss face the nation while sununu 
was on nbcs meet the press 
rep dan rostenkowski chairman of the ways and means committee 
said his proposal is designed to protect middleincome and poor 
america and make everyone share in the pain of governing 
im not going to deny that were trying to make a political 
statement and there certainly is evidence that theres now a 
division between democrats and republicans said rostenkowski 
dill 
while sununu and quayle strongly opposed the house proposal 
they did not criticize the senate finance committees plan to leave 
the 28 percent rate intact and instead close tax loopholes for the 
rich 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the committee said he 
would not go along with an increase to 33 percent although he 
supports it in theory because bushs opposition dooms any tax 
package that includes such an increase 
that means that we have a progressive table that those making 
the highest income will pay the highest increase in the taxes he 
said on abcs this week with david brinkley 
any deficitreduction plan is expected to reduce defense 
spending cut medicare and hold back spending in other federal 
programs debate in recent days has focused primarily on raising

the supreme court boosted the federal 
governments crackdown on obscenity today as it let stand the 
forced closing of three adult bookstores and nine video rental 
shops in virginia 
the court over one dissenting vote rejected arguments by the 
businesses owners who were convicted of racketeering and selling 
obscene materials that the subsequent seizures of the businesses 
violated their freespeech rights 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
in other decisions today 
the court which has twice ruled that burning the american flag 
is protected political speech set aside a minnesota mans 
flagburning conviction the justices told a federal appeals court 
to restudy a freespeech challenge to the mans federal conviction 
for burning the flag 
the lower court had ruled that the an was arrested and 
prosecuted not for any political message contained in his flag 
burning but to prevent further breaches of the peace 
ruled against a former air force sergeant convicted of 
aggravated assault because he engaged in homosexual conduct while 
knowingly infected with an aidsrelated virus the justices 
without comment let stand the mans conviction dishonorable 
military discharge and sixyear prison sentence 
refused to revive a copyright lawsuit over an unauthorized 
biography of l ron hubbard founder of the scientology religion 
the justices without comment let stand a decision throwing out 
allegations of copyright infringement against the books publisher 
refused to help states ban deceptive advertising by airlines 
without comment the court left intact a ruling that only the 
federal government may regulate airline ads the lower courts 
ruling said that texas officials lack the authority to take action 
against allegedly misleading airline ads 
ruled against two policemen from peotone ill who contended 
they were disciplined unlawfully for wearing earrings when off 
duty the court without comment rejected arguments that the two 
officers constitutional right to make a fashion statement while on 
their own time had been violated 
in the virginia obscenity case the seizures were carried out 
under provisions of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act or rico those convicted of participating in an 
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering may be forced to 
forfeit all assets and proceeds stemming from the illegal activity 
the justices were told that the virginia case is the first 
prosecuted under rico in which the racketeering activity charges 
were based entirely on obscenity crimes 
obscenity was added in 1984 to the long list of underlying 
crimes on which a rico prosecution could be based 
the courts determination of the validity of postjudgment 
forfeiture in this case will have enormous impact upon the future 
of rico obscenity prosecutions both state and federal lawyers 
for the convicted business owners said 
dennis and barbara pryba owners of the corporations that 
operated the bookstores and video shops in northern virginia were 
convicted of selling and distributing obscene magazines and 
videotapes worth about 105 
an employee jennifer williams also was convicted on obscenity 
charges 
dennis pryba was sentenced to three years in prison and five 
years probation and was fined 75000 barbara pryba was given a 
suspended prison sentence and fined 200000 ms williams was 
given three years probation and fined 2250 
one of the corporations the prybas owned also was fined 
200000 
after a separate jury trial a federal judge ordered that all 
assets including corporate stock inventory bank accounts 
automobiles and even office furniture be forfeited 
the convictions and forfeiture order was upheld by the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals last april 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the prybas and 
williams argued that forfeiture of businesses engaged in 
constitutionally protected activities the distribution of 
materials not found to be obscene amounts to an impermissible 
prior restraint of speech 
although obscenity itself is a crime a past finding of 
obscenity has never in this courts view justified a ban on 
further communicative offerings the appeal said 
the bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal 
if bookstores newsstands publishing houses and the like were 
immune from forfeiture drug lords and other racketeers could 
invest in those businesses and thereby insulate their criminal 
proceeds from seizure government lawyers argued 
the case is pryba vs us 891902

defense secretary richard cheney said today the 
united states is prepared to keep troops in saudi arabia for years 
if necessary 
were there as long as the saudis want us as long as it 
takes to get the job done and no one should underestimate our 
staying power cheney said in a british broadcasting corp radio 
interview 
the defense secretary was to meet with prime minister margaret 
thatcher and british defense secretary tom king later today on the 
first stop of his 10day visit to europe cheney goes to moscow on 
tuesday and then to paris 
britain already has warplanes and naval ships in the persian 
gulf it is sending about 6000 combat troops as part of the 
usled multinational force assembled after iraq invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 
cheney said economic sanctions were only just beginning to hurt 
iraq and stressed the united states hopes to avoid war 
mrs thatcher told her conservative party at its annual 
conference friday to prepare for war if sanctions fail foreign 
secretary douglas hurd called for an assessment within weeks of the 
effectiveness of the economic sanctions 
cheney said mrs thatcher was just stating very forthrightly 
the view we in the united states hold as well 
he dismissed predictions that support in the united states for 
the troop buildup will decline and the international alliance 
against iraqi president saddam hussein will crumble unless force is 
used soon time is much more likely to be on our side than it is 
on his side said cheney 
asked if there was the political will in the united states to 
maintain 250000 troops in saudi arabia for some years to keep 
up the pressure cheney said there certainly is 
he said the united states would respond very forcefully to 
an iraqi attack on any ally in the multinational force 
cheney said there is some concern that saddam might resort to 
military means to break the sanctions rather than suffer continued 
economic harm

friends and colleagues remembered leonard 
bernstein as an exuberant conductor a versatile composer and the 
man who more than anyone brought american music to the world 
with him goes a spectacular special era in american music 
making said violinist isaac stern who paused after his 70th 
birthday tribute at the academy of music in philadelphia on sunday 
to remember his friend of 47 years 
he was in a way the epitome of this burgeoning exultant young 
powerful giant called music making in this country 
frank sinatra who starred in the 1949 film version of 
bernsteins on the town called bernsteins death a personal 
loss to me and to the world 
he was perhaps one of the 10 best interpreters of fine music 
in the past 100 years he said 
bernstein whose career included the hit broadway shows on the 
town and west side story and hundreds of recordings died 
sunday at age 72 
the loss is too great to consider said west side story 
choreographer jerome robbins his voice breaking ive lost a 
very good personal friend and collaborator from early on 
he was the most versatile musician and he did more than any 
other person in this century for the appreciation of american music 
and music culture said sir georg solti music director of 
chicago symphony orchestra 
his departure creates an unfillable gap in our artistic and 
spiritual life he leaves us at a moment when we seem to need him 
the most said john williams conductor of boston pops 
in austria noted music critic franz endler spoke of bernstein 
as a really good friend not only for important people in vienna 
but also simple people one of the most openhearted people i 
ever knew 
nobody will ever again personify our love for music like 
leonard bernstein did said vienna state opera artistic director 
claudio abbado 
abbado said bernstein was not only an incomparable musician 
whose enthusiasm and joy in making music were a constant delight 
but also a true spontaneous friend whose example was a source of 
inspiration during a great part of my musical career 
stage director otto schenk said the actual interruption 
through physical death is just incomprehensible for me my meeting 
with him was a meeting with music and with joy 
he was the most unique musician of this century there is no 
doubt about it said zubin mehta music director of the new york 
philharmonic and the israel philharmonic orchestra 
he first of all educated a whole generation in america with 
his televised educational concerts and as the music director of 
the new york philharmonic hundreds of recordings have become a 
household item in every music lovers home mehta said from tel 
aviv i think our musicians will miss him a lot 
on his doctors advice bernstein retired from conducting four 
days before his death citing emphysema and other lung ailments 
bernstein once a heavy smoker last conducted on aug 19 at the 
boston symphonys summer home at tanglewood mass 
in the past few days the words from one of his broadway songs 
has been going through my head just when the fun is starting 
comes the time for parting said composer ned rorem quoting 
from well catch up some other time from on the town 
broadway compositions often eclipsed his most important music 
his symphonies and chamber music rorem added if he had 
specialized he would have been so frustrated as to be impotent 
in 1958 bernstein became the first americanborn director of the 
new york philharmonic he stepped down in 1969 to devote more time 
to composition 
he was the new york philharmonic in its spirit and very 
essence and were going to miss him like crazy said nick 
webster philharmonic director 
his greatest influence was as a performer said 
composerconductor leon kirchner emeritus professor at harvard 
there were simply hundreds of kids who went to tanglewood he had 
a very profound sense of musical structure of the marvelous 
meanings of musical symbols he was able to translate them make 
them intelligible to young people 
pianist jerome lowenthal who had played bernsteins age of 
anxiety with bernstein conducting said bernstein related to 
this music he was a very tortured man and you just had to have a 
word with him to know that and at the same time he managed to be 
embarrassingly charming his success just exacerbated the 
torture he suffered from the pressures of superstardom

following are excerpts of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reaction to being selected monday for the nobel peace 
prize he spoke in an interview with soviet television and several 
foreign tv stations and his remarks were translated from russian 
by the associated press 
 
the first thing id like to say is to confirm the news its 
quite true i was just now receiving the ambassador of norway and 
he informed me about the decision of the nobel committee about 
awarding the 1990 nobel peace prize and that this decision as he 
said had a definite motivation 
well what shall i say words fail one at such moments i am 
moved nevertheless ill try to do it first of all i am deeply 
touched as a person moved by this decision i perceive this action 
of the most authoritative organization of the global community 
first of all not in personal terms but as recognition of the 
significance of the immense cause of perestroika for the destiny of 
the entire world i think that was what was crucial for the final 
decision in that committee which is so serious as we know they 
always take sound decisions 
secondly when we were starting our perestroika we thought and 
above all we wanted at that time to be understood correctly to be 
understood above all in the sense that we ourselves need 
perestroika we came to the conclusion that we could not continue 
to live as we had lived that we needed deep transformations in all 
spheres of life and that it was the will of the people to 
develop our policies and to act but even then we wanted to be 
understood correctly in that what we were going to do would have 
vast significance for all countries for the entire world because 
it was happening in such a huge country as the soviet union which 
plays a great role and bears on its shoulders a great 
responsibility to the world community

a series of chainreaction accidents 
involving more than 20 cars including one carrying ammunition 
slammed into each other today on a smoky fogshrouded highway at 
least a dozen people were injured police said 
bullets exploded when the car carrying ammunition caught fire 
state police said 
it was no major thing no big explosion just some rounds 
popping off said sgt joe lentini 
no one was injured by the bullets but emergency workers said at 
least 12 to 15 people hurt in the chainreaction crash shortly 
before 8 am were taken to a hospital near new orleans 
i dont know how many we transported so many i quit 
counting said david bell an ambulance worker 
cars pickups and larger trucks littered a milelong stretch of 
the lafittelarose highway about five miles south of new orleans 
the fog was so thick state police cars crept toward the scene 
with two troopers walking in front of the cars to guide them 
lentini said 
state trooper ernest dykes said smoke from marsh fires 
apparently set by deer hunters contributed to the hazard posed by 
the fog 
it was foggy but what made it so bad is the hunters are 
burning the marsh they do that to make the deer move out so they 
can shoot them it was real thick complained david dumestre an 
emergency medical worker 
dykes said the practice is illegal but some hunters burn the 
marshes anyway 
visibility was so bad dykes said that he could feel the heat 
from the burning car containing the ammunition but couldnt see it 
from 20 feet away

united germanys first ambassador to the jewish 
state presented his credentials to the president today and assured 
israelis they had nothing to fear from germanys unification 
otto von der gablentz 60 was the first ambassador accredited 
to a foreign country since unification oct 3 german officials 
said 
von der gablentz said that his country would never forget the 
holocaust nor germanys historic responsibility to the jewish 
people 
israelis have expressed concern that a unified germany would 
dominate europe and forget its responsibility for the jewish people 
over the holocaust in which 6 million jews were killed 
israel has no reason to be sad about the disappearance of east 
germany it has good reasons to trust the feeling of responsibilty 
which we have felt in germany for our past he said on israel 
radio 
i have deep respect for the feelings of israelis he said 
adding the nazi horrors of world war ii would be remembered in a 
united germany 
president chaim herzog who received the new ambassador at his 
residence in jerusalem said that he was not sorry that east 
germany had ceased to exist 
i cannot mourn the disappearance of east germany which was a 
hostile nation toward israel which was a center for the palestine 
liberation organization and a center for terror in europe against 
israel and other nations herzog said 
before german unification west germany was a valuable ally of 
israel often defending the jewish state in the international 
arena it paid more than 40 billion in reparations to israel and 
holocaust victims around the world

dr john gibbs the hospitals director of medical affairs 
acknowledged finances played a role in the decision to change 
surgeons most of his montesinos patients werent covered 
under the drgs he said the resource utilization was high 
the amount of blood pump time a lot of xrays and the resources 
of the hospital 
hospitals now must go to considerable lengths to get rid of 
financially rebellious doctors but some fear it soon will become 
much easier 
some medical consultants and attorneys suggest rewriting 
hospital bylaws to permit financial credentialing this would 
allow review committees to consider doctors economic profiles 
including the profitability of their patients when deciding 
whethr to allow them to admit patients 
others worry doctors will shortchange their patients if they are 
forced to put the hospitals interests first said the amas lang 
when you base medical staff privileges on economic criteria 
unrelated to quality you are setting up a situation where the 
patient can be harmed

six seconds was all it took to flatten eight 
12story apartment buildings in northern england 
the dilapidated buildings engulfed a halfmile area in dust and 
debris sunday as the controlled demolition group reduced the 
buildings to 50000 tons of rubble 
the firm said it would submit its demolition by explosives to 
the guinness book of records as the largest in britain 
it wont surpass the worlds largest demolition by explosives 
though that record belongs to the company that blasted the 
21story traymore hotel in atlantic city in 1972 
controlled demolition group director richard van said it took 
two months to lay the 6000 explosives that destroyed the highrise 
apartments 
the buildings built in 1968 and containing 492 apartments had 
become a haven for criminals and the local authority in salford 
165 miles northwest of london said it would be less expensive to 
start anew 
the apartment blocks will be replaced on the 22acre site by a 
58 million governmentaided development of nearly 500 private 
apartments and houses with a leisure center

the supreme court turned aside freespeech 
arguments monday and boosted the federal governments crackdown on 
obscenity 
the justices over one dissenting vote let stand the forced 
closing of three adult bookstores and nine video rental shops in 
virginia under a federal antiracketeering law 
the businesses owners convicted of racketeering and selling 
obscene materials had argued that the subsequent seizures of their 
properties violated their freespeech rights 
the seizures were carried out under provisions of the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act rico those convicted 
under that law may be forced to forfeit all assets and proceeds 
stemming from their illegal activity 
justice byron r white voted to hear the business owners 
appeal but four votes are needed to grant such review 
in other action monday the court 
rejected the appeal of a former air force sergeant convicted in 
washington state of aggravated assault for engaging in homosexual 
conduct while knowingly infected with an aidsrelated virus 
set aside a minnesota mans federal conviction for burning an 
american flag during a 1988 demonstration in minneapolis the 
justices told a federal appeals court to reconsider the conviction 
in light of their decision last june that flag burning is protected 
political speech 
refused to let texas and by extension other states as well 
ban deceptive advertising by airlines the justices let stand an 
appeals court ruling that only the federal government may regulate 
airline ads 
unanimously ruled in a georgia case that state officials need 
federal clearance under the voting rights act of 1965 before 
holding elections for state judgeships 
refused to revive a copyright lawsuit against the publisher of 
an unauthorized biography of l ron hubbard founder of the 
scientology religion 
turned down the appeal of two peotone ill policemen who said 
they were disciplined unlawfully for wearing earrings while off 
duty 
in the obscenity and racketeering case the virginia bookstore 
and video rental shop owners are the first ever prosecuted on 
racketeering charges stemming entirely from obscenity crimes 
obscenity was added in 1984 to the long list of underlying 
crimes on which a rico prosecution could be based 
the courts determination of the validity of postjudgment 
forfeiture in this case will have enormous impact upon the future 
of rico obscenity prosecutions both state and federal lawyers 
for the convicted business owners said 
dennis and barbara pryba owners of the corporations that 
operated the bookstores and video shops in northern virginia were 
convicted of selling and distributing obscene magazines and 
videotapes worth about 105 
an employee jennifer williams also was convicted on obscenity 
charges 
dennis pryba was sentenced to three years in prison and five 
years probation and was fined 75000 barbara pryba was given a 
suspended prison sentence and fined 200000 ms williams was 
given three years probation and fined 2250 
one of the corporations the prybas owned also was fined 
200000 
after a separate jury trial a federal judge ordered that all 
assets including corporate stock inventory bank accounts 
automobiles and even office furniture be forfeited 
the convictions and forfeiture order was upheld by the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals last april 
in their appeal the prybas and williams said forfeiture of 
businesses engaged in constitutionally protected activities the 
distribution of materials not found to be obscene amounts to an 
impermissible prior restraint of speech 
the bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal 
if bookstores newsstands publishing houses and the like were 
immune from forfeiture drug lords and other racketeers could 
invest in those businesses and thereby insulate their criminal 
proceeds from seizure government lawyers argued

a judge issued an arrest warrant today for 
a man accused of staging a dogfight for a kcnctv reporter who was 
filming a series on pitbull fighting that has cost the reporter 
her job 
jefferson county district judge gaspar perricone issued the 
warrant for guy walker who faces two counts of dog fighting after 
walker failed to appear at a court hearing walkers lawyer 
antonio lucero said his client could not find transportation 
the other three defendants in the case former kcnc reporter 
wendy bergen and former station photographers scott wright and jim 
stair appeared before perricone with their lawyers 
the fights allegedly were staged for bergens televised series 
blood sport an expose of underground dog fighting that was 
broadcast during the may ratings sweeps period 
bergen who was indicted on nine felony charges is accused of 
arranging the fights paying for them lying about the source of 
the videotape lying to kcnc management and encouraging a friend to 
lie to the grand jury 
she had claimed the tape was sent to her anonymously she and 
the two photographers resigned from kcnc 
perricone scheduled a hearing for dec 14 and a tentative trial 
date of feb 4 
the judge denied defense motions to bar cameras from the 
courtroom 
bergen spoke only briefly at the hearing saying only yes i 
do when asked if she understood her rights and the charges 
against her 
bergens lawyers said earlier they plan to challenge evidence 
obtained from her through the use of an informant wired with a 
hidden microphone 
bergen allegedly talked freely with mark j labriola a friend 
who had told bergen that he had connections with dog fighters and 
who was wearing a microphone labriola who admitted helping bergen 
stage several dogfights had made a deal with prosecutors granting 
him immunity from prosecution 
defense attorneys contend that it was improper for prosecutors 
to send in their agent with a hidden microphone after bergens 
attorney prevented prosecutors from directly asking her certain 
questions 
neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys will discuss their 
legal strategy but a challenge is expected because jefferson 
county prosecutors elicited damaging statements from bergen with 
labriolas hidden tape recorder 
a disciplinary rule in the attorneys code says lawyers should 
not contact a defendant directly or through an agent such as 
labriola once the defendant is represented by counsel 
the defendants were indicted in september on 15 felony charges 
for allegedly staging pitbull fights and lying to the grand jury 
stair and wright face charges of accessory to a crime and 
conspiracy to commit perjury stair also has been indicted on one 
count each of dog fighting and conspiracy to commit a dogfight

a major apartheid law that 
barred blacks from public facilities for decades was formally 
scrapped monday but rightwing whites planned to exploit loopholes 
to maintain segregation 
in a separate development police said factional fighting left 
eight blacks dead as rival groups battled with pistols and knives 
at a migrant workers hostel in kempton park east of johannesburg 
the sunday night battle was the worst single incident since 
relative calm was restored to the black townships around 
johannesburg three weeks ago 
the demise of the separate amenities act a pillar of south 
africas apartheid system did not have noticeable effects in major 
cities where libraries parks buses swimming pools toilets and 
other facilities have been integrated in recent years 
but in smaller towns controlled by the rightwing conservative 
party confrontations were expected between blacks and whites 
opposed to the change 
in the town of middelburg east of johannesburg white residents 
voted to close all public facilities rather than open them to all 
races 
other towns planned to charge exorbitant fees for 
nonresidents most of the people living inside town limits are 
white while blacks are forced to live outside the town boundaries 
under remaining apartheid laws that segregate neighborhoods 
for example the town of bethal planned to charge an annual fee 
of 200 to nonresidents wishing to use the public library 
conservative party member of parliament ferdi hartzenberg said 
the move to scrap the separate amenities act destroyed a 
considerable part of white peoples own community life 
antiapartheid leaders urged blacks to begin using facilities 
and threatened strikes and boycotts against towns trying to 
maintain segregation 
entry to public facilities must be unconditional and free 
what these councils are planning is an illegal act of banditry 
said african national congress official joe nkuna 
hernus kriel federal minister of planning and provincial 
affairs warned that towns trying to circumvent the change may face 
legal action 
parliament repealed the separate amenities act in june and gave 
communities until oct 15 to comply the national party which has 
ruled south africa since 1948 approved the act in 1953 as part of 
its strict segregation politices 
but since president fw de klerk took office in august 1989 he 
has instituted a number of racial reforms released black leaders 
such as nelson mandela and opened talks with the anc to negotiate 
a new constitution giving the black majority a share of power 
the recent violence in townships around johannesburg has 
strained relations between the government and the anc the leading 
black opposition movement 
but de klerk who returned from a trip to portugal and britain 
on monday said certain tensions will arise from time to time 
he said the disagreements were not serious and the peace talks 
remained on track

business inventories inched upward 05 percent 
in august despite a 21 percent gain in sales the government said 
monday analysts said that while the imbalance bears watching it 
was not at a dangerous level 
analysts watch for signs of undue inventory growth during 
periods of economic weakness because unusually large backlogs could 
cause production cutbacks and loss of jobs adding even more stress 
to the economy 
some analysts believe the economy is headed toward a recession 
this year if it is not already in one 
but michael boskin president bushs chief economic adviser 
told an american stock exchange conference monday he expected the 
economy to skirt a downturn 
even though it is particularly difficult to forecast the 
shortterm course of the economy by our best estimate the 
economy is going to grow weakly in the fourth quarter of 1990 and 
early 1991 he said i do believe the third quarter data 
will show that the economy continued to grow 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots in august totaled a seasonally adjusted 8065 billion up 
from 8022 billion the previous month 
but the 05 percent gain in august slowed slightly from a 07 
percent increase in july which had been the largest since an 08 
percent advance in july 1989 
at the same time the department said sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 5519 billion up from 5404 billion in july july sales 
had declined a revised 04 percent rather than the 05 percent 
first reported last month 
the activity pushed the ratio of inventories to sales down to 
146 from a 148 level in july the ratio means it would take 146 
months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the august sales pace 
the increased inventories is another indicator a sign of a 
troubled economy said thomas runiewicz an economist with the 
wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
but he also noted that industry has become much more efficient 
in terms of managing inventories and keeping them low and that 
the situation is not as critical as it would have been a few years 
ago 
nevertheless backlogs grew in all major business categories 
retail inventories were up 13 percent to 2395 billion 
manufacturers posted a 02 percent gain to 3739 billion and 
wholesalers registered a 03 percent advance to 1930 billion 
at the same time manufacturing sales were up 34 percent to 
2459 billion while wholesalers listed a 26 percent increase to 
1564 billion 
retail sales on the other hand dropped 04 percent to 1496 
billion 
the department reported last friday that retail sales rebounded 
11 percent in september driven largely by automobile purchases 
and surging gasoline prices 
but economists said the two special factors masked an otherwise 
weak report which included a large decline in department store 
sales excluding gasoline and autos sales rose only 01 percent 
last month

prime minister yitzhak shamir today accused the 
international community of hypocrisy and said israel would not pay 
the price of the wests problems in the arab world 
he repeated his warning to iraq that israel would hit back if 
attacked and warned it against intervening in jordan which 
borders on israel and is seen from jerusalem as a buffer against 
iraqi attack 
any intervention in the situation there or intervention in 
its territory by another state is likely to raise the tension the 
dangers to levels we cannot accept shamir said 
shamirs speech opening the fall session of parliament reflected 
deep bitterness over the worlds reaction to the killing of 19 
palestinians on the temple mount 
but he stopped short of directly attacking the united states 
israels chief military and financial backer for siding with 
israels critics in the un security council 
shamir complained in censuring israels use of force against 
moslem rioters at the temple mount the world body ignored israels 
argument that it was provoked by stones thrown at jewish worshipers 
at the adjacent western wall 
what stood out was the absence of any mention of the grave 
attack on the jewish peoples holiest place he said 
shamir said that when terrorists killed israeli tourists in 
egypt or when hundreds of moslems died in riots at the saudi 
arabian holy city of mecca we didnt hear similar denunciations 
and we did not see the security council being convened 
israel was expected to put up with the renewed and massive 
supply of arms of advanced weapons to those states to agree to 
negotiations with the terrorist organizations and to ignore the 
words of incitement and hatred that are constantly voiced and 
written in the arab states 
each time reality comes and slaps anew the faces of those of 
who hold with theories of moderation and confirms our fears and 
assertions he said adding 
but the lesson is not learned at any rate israel will not 
pay the price of the lessons that the international community must 
extract from this gloomy reality 
israeli officials have objected strongly to the argument that 
the united states had to back an antiisrael resolution in the 
security council in order to preserve arab support for us action 
against iraqi president saddam hussein 
a senior official speaking anonymously said we are not 
prepared to be the sacrificial lamb of the antisaddam coalition 
leftwing israeli parties said they would mount a challenge in 
parliament to try to reverse the cabinets rejection of a un 
investigation into tee temple mount killings 
but even with the support of the labor party the main 
opposition the motion would have difficulty overcoming the 62seat 
majority of shamirs rightwing coalition in the 120member 
parliament 
the security council voted unanimously friday to condemn the 
oct 8 shootings on the temple mount a site revered by both jews 
and moslems arabs call it haram alsharif 
the united nations also authorized its own threeman 
investigation team 
in rejecting the un mission sunday israel defied both the 
united nations and the united states which sent a message asking 
israel to accept the mission 
the daily yedioth ahronoth reported that in the message 
secretary of state james a baker iii suggested israels refusal to 
accept the un team could further distract world attention from 
internatinal efforts to solve the gulf crisis 
israel also defied the united states on a second issue 
announcing a new housing plan for soviet immigrants that ignores 
american pleas not to settle them in warwon territory 
six of the eight new residential communities are to be in east 
jerusalem on territory captured by israel from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war and annexed 
the decision was designed to reinforce israels claims to the 
city 
the heart of the jewish people needs to expand faster said 
housing minister ariel sharon who heads a cabinet committee on 
immigration there is no better answer to the political dangers 
than strengthening the jewish population 
his committee decided to build about 5000 apartments in the 
coming year and to ask for sweeping incentives for contractors to 
build in jerusalem including the eastern sector said absorption 
ministry spokeswoman ida benshitreet

tom king plans to marry vivian taylor 
this saturday right after the ceremony hell jump off a bridge 
king is one of 300 parachuting daredevils who plan to leap off 
north americas secondhighest bridge 876 feet into the new river 
gorge a canyon slicing through the heart of the appalachians 
the wedding on the new river gorge bridge falls on the 11th 
annual bridge day thats the one day a year the span is closed to 
traffic so pedestrians can enjoy the view and the autumn foliage 
and parachutists can jump off 
the event attracts the largest number of parachutists who belong 
to the us base association base stands for building antenna 
span and earth 
for most of the jumpers this is it said jean boenish 
bases executive director they take their vacation time save 
their pennies and wait to get out to west virginia 
the us 19 bridge completed in 1977 is the longest steel arch 
bridge in the world and the second highest in north america after 
the 1053foot royal gorge bridge in colorado 
about 100000 spectators are expected said cindy whitlock of 
the fayette county chamber of commerce hotels have been booked for 
months in fayette county and are selling out fast in raleigh and 
kanawha counties whitlock said 
king 39 a real estate agent in memphis tenn brought taylor 
to bridge day last year and she literally loved the place 
i fell in love with her she fell in love with me she fell in 
love with the bridge he said 
it seemed logical at the time to plan a wedding there king 
said 
taylor 34 a registered nurse said the wedding will be as 
traditional as it can be on a bridge she will wear a gown the 
groom will wear a tuxedo and there will be five bridesmaids and 
groomsmen 
after the ceremony king two groomsmen and a few guests will 
leap off the bridge taylor said that for her just watching is 
enough she called last years experience a natural high you just 
cant explain 
but king a veteran skydiver said theres nothing to worry 
about even though three people have been killed in leaps from the 
bridge two during bridge day festivities the last death was in 
1987 
its fun its a sport its challenging king said we 
dont think its dangerous nothings dangerous if you know what 
youre doing 
boenish said most base jumpers are trained skydivers she 
described the experience 
as soon as you jump off youre kind of suspended and then 
you start falling and you get through that and what you start to 
get into is that familiar comfort of high air speed 
king describes the bridge jump as high anxiety followed by 
total euphoria 
the jump itself is extremely nerveracking but as soon as the 
parachute opens and everythings ok its beautiful he said 
the jumpers leap from the bridges center and fall at speeds 
nearing 60 mph before slowing down to land on a sandbar boenish 
said 
parachutists were prohibited from taking the plunge last year 
because the river which is also popular with whitewater rafters 
was running dangerously high following heavy rain but about three 
dozen jumpers went off the bridge anyway and a few were arrested 
the river under the bridge is under federal jurisdiction as the 
new river gorge national river while base jumping is banned from 
federal properties like half dome in yosemite national park no one 
will be banned from jumping into the gorge this year if conditions 
are favorable national park service chief ranger bill blake said 
but parachutists who jump when its not legal face up to six 
months in prison a5000 fine and would be banned for life from 
jumping off the new river bridge blake said 
boenish expects 300 jumpers from six countries including 
australia and south africa

more than 40000 children under the age of 
five die every day from malnutrition and infection despite 
increases in the worldwide supply of food a hunger relief group 
said monday 
children are among 500 million people suffering from hunger 
most of them living in poor developing nations in asia africa and 
latin america according to the report issued by bread for the 
world the group works to eliminate hunger 
a major cause of hunger is disruptions caused by wars and 
fighting in many nations afghanistan angola cambodia ethiopia 
sudan mozambique and liberia to name a few 
art simon the groups president said bread hoped to encourage 
countries to slow down military spending and direct the money to 
feeding the hungry 
the billions we have spent to arm developing countries now 
haunts us especially since that money could have been used to meet 
the worlds nutritional needs he said 
many deaths of children could be prevented if food and medical 
treatment were available he said 
although the third world has the greatest number of hungry 
people developed nations like the united states are not immune 
from the problem the report said 
despite its record agricultural productivity as many as 18 
million americans are without the proper nutrients that promote 
good health and growth of these some 8 million are children and 2 
million are over the age of 65 the report said 
a disproportionate number of hungry people are black indian or 
hispanic the south is more affected than any other region 
more than twothirds of americas hungry live in metropolitan 
areas but the poverty rate in rural areas is growing faster that 
in urban areas the report said 
in an overview of conditions around the world the report said 
africa is the region of greatest concern much of the continent is 
characterized by famine declining per capita food production and 
collapsing social services 
of the 550 million people on the continent some 200 million are 
hungry or vulnerable to hunger the report said dislocations 
caused by war and environmental degradation have created hundreds 
of thousands of refugees on the continent 
asia has seen its food production increase in the last 30 years 
as a result in part of the technologies of the green revolution 
singapore taiwan south korea thailand indonesia and china have 
made great strides to reduce hunger 
but other countries have not fared as well hunger and poverty 
persist in places such as the philippines nepal bangladesh and 
sri lanka 
in latin america poverty and hunger are at greater levels in 
1990 than they were in 1980 the average per capita income dropped 
in the first years of the decade as countries on the continent 
struggled to service burgeoning debt payments

the supreme court refused monday to help 
states ban deceptive advertising by airlines 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that only the 
federal government may regulate airline ads 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled in april that texas 
officials lack the authority to take action against allegedly 
misleading airline ads 
the appals court which normally only has jurisdiction in 
texas mississippi and louisiana said its april ruling also was 
binding on the 33 other states that supported texas 
the 33 states in a separate appeal said the appeals court 
exceeded its authority 
the states are alaska arizona arkansas california colorado 
connecticut florida kansas idaho illinois iowa maine 
maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri nebraska 
nevada new york north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma 
oregon rhode island south dakota tennessee vermont washington 
west virginia wisconsin and wyoming 
the case stems from an effort by texas officials to bar 
allegedly false advertising by twa continental and british 
airways 
texas officials said the airlines misled consumers making it 
appear they were offering lower fares than competitors by 
prominently advertising the ticket price and only mentioning 
additional taxes surcharges and fees in the small print

ted mondale isnt banking on his famous 
name to get him elected to the minnesota legislature the son of 
the former vice president plans to spend a record 120000 
campaigning for the state senate 
mondale 33 is running against republican incumbent phyllis 
mcquaid who questions not only his judgment but also his motives 
were always hearing that people are being turned off by 
bigspending campaigns mcquaid said it makes you wonder 
whats going on 
state gop chairman bob weinholzer thinks he knows 
obviously hes in this race to eventually run for higher 
office weinholzer said mondale moved to the district only about 
a year and a half ago and hes raised more than a third of his 
campaign money from outside minnesota 
its almost absurd weinholzer said of the outofstate 
contributions for a state senate race weve never seen anything 
like that 
mondale is the only state senate candidate on the nov 6 ballot 
who did not agree to abide by a voluntary 40669 spending limit 
the current record is 93000 spent by another democrat in a 1986 
state senate race 
hes a new candidate running against an established incumbent 
in a district thats marginally republican said senate 
democratic majority leader roger moe 
he thinks he needs more and im in no position to question 
his judgment 
mondale a lawyer and lobbyist refers to his republican 
critics comments as the politics of diversion 
i dont want to stay in the state legislature all my life 
he said it is a citizen legislature and many times incumbents 
stay in too long and lose touch with their constituents if i do a 
good job at the legislature then perhaps there would be an 
opportunity to serve in higher office 
mcquaid 62 agreed to abide by the spending limit but because 
mondale isnt abiding by it mcquaid is allowed to exceed the limit 
and receive a public subsidy she had raised 38509 through august 
and will receive an 18000 subsidy mondale had raised about 
98000 during the same period and had spent 83360 
there isnt another state senate race with a candidate who has 
his name id mcquaid said that alone should give him a 
10point start over any other challenger 
its unfortunate hes doing this she said of his campaign 
spending 
mcquaid says shes pleased with the campaign outlook and that 
results from internal polls look very good for her mondale 
said he believes the race is close 
mondale said the advantages of being the son of former vice 
president and us senator walter f mondale dont guarantee 
electoral success 
my father served this state and nation well he said but 
just being a mondale does not win an election i equate being the 
son or daughter of a famous person or of anyone much like being a 
woman in the workplace people expect more of you and you have to 
be twice as good as the other person to gain acceptance 
mondale said he wont unilaterally disarm by limiting 
campaign spending in a system that favors incumbents and he said 
hes proud of his ability to raise money from family friends and 
contacts he made while working on national political campaigns 
when the candidates arent talking about money theyre often 
talking about experience 
mcquaid highlights her record as state senator mayor and school 
board member and her involvement with community groups 
mondale said mcquaid has been an ineffective legislator and has 
not proposed an agenda for the 90s 
i hope the comparison will be made between where i want to go 
and where shes been over the last eight years mondale said 
if thats the comparison ill win if the question is whos 
lived here longer and been to more bake sales phyllis mcquaid will 
win

attorney general dick thornburgh went against 
career justice department lawyers in agreeing to pay 25000 to a 
former department official who was investigated in the alleged 
disclosure of government secrets say sources familiar with the 
case 
a senior career department attorney who reviewed the case of the 
official political appointee roger pilon concluded there was 
sufficient evidence to have justified his firing and therefore he 
was not entitled to reimbursement for legal expenses according to 
a memo to thornburgh obtained by the associated press 
but the attorney general overruled those findings and instead 
authorized a settlement with pilon who had headed the asylum 
policy and review unit 
several top officials strongly disagreed with thornburgh 
according to sources familiar with the issue who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
deputy attorney general donald b ayer who wrote the memo to 
thornburgh resigned in may partially because of the attorney 
generals handling of the matter 
the dispute began in 1988 when pilon was investigated by the 
fbi in connection with an allegation that his wife juliana had 
disclosed a classified state department document to a south african 
diplomat the document analyzed communist involvement in black 
nationalist movements opposed to the south african government 
both pilons have denied any wrongdoing and mrs pilon has said 
she did not pass on any classified material 
prosecutors declined to press charges against the couple and 
turned the matter over to the justice departments office of 
professional responsibility for a review of pilons conduct 
pilon was placed on paid leave during the investigation by the 
fbi and the departments careerstaffed internal watchdog unit 
he later was reinstated by associate deputy attorney general dee 
v benson who said in a sept 9 1988 letter to pilon that no 
implication adverse to you should be taken from the 
investigations 
several weeks later pilon resigned to become a fellow at a 
conservative research organization 
last november the office of professional responsibility 
released its 1988 annual report that alluded to pilons case 
without naming him 
the report said that a foreign counterintelligence investigation 
indicated that an employee may have been involved in the 
disclosure of classified information to a foreign government 
while evidence did not warrant prosecution the report said the 
investigation had found sufficient cause to terminate the 
officials appointment and said the employee resigned prior to 
the initiation of removal proceedings 
pilon who told reporters that the report did refer to his case 
quickly demanded an apology from the department asked for payment 
of his legal fees and threatened to sue for character defamation 
thornburgh then asked ayer to investigate pilons demands ayer 
assigned the case to career justice department lawyer lawrence s 
robbins who at the time worked in the solicitor generals office 
robbins according to a jan 24 memo from ayer to thornburgh 
found that pilon had been reinstated despite sufficient evidence 
to justify pilons dismissal 
the memo obtained by the ap did not detail any evidence robbins 
cited in his classified report 
robbins also found according to ayers memo that opr had not 
been told of pilons reinstatement and thus could not be faulted 
for saying the employee had resigned prior to the initiation of 
removal proceedings 
ayer recommended that pilon not be compensated for his legal 
expenses 
sometime after receiving the memo thornburgh decided to award 
pilon the 25000 and to issue a formal apology for the wording of 
the opr report 
ayer who now refuses to comment said after he resigned in may 
that thornburgh had tried to use the matter which he did not 
identify by name to discredit opr and its head michael e shaheen 
jr himself a career official 
ayer also contended that thornburgh had been trying to undermine 
shaheen as his office was seeking to investigate two of the 
attorney generals closest aides on an unrelated matter 
acting at thornburghs direction assistant attorney general 
stuart m gerson in july wrote matthew l myers pilons attorney 
that the couple were entitled to an apology because the 1988 
investigation of mr pilon did not produce any evidence sufficient 
to warrant his dismissal from the department 
that letter also referred to confusion created by the 1988 
opr report and said that pilon had been restored 
unconditionally to his position and that his subsequent 
resignation was selfinitiated and was not made in the face of 
removal proceedings which in fact never had been contemplated or 
ordered 
the letter said the department was awarding the 25000 to 
settle pilons complaint 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian now refuses to 
comment on the pilon issue except to say that we stand by the 
report issued by gerson 
pilon in an interview said his decision to resign played no 
part in his reinstatement by the department 
you just dont return a topsecret security clearance even if 
it is for three weeks if there is evidence that suggests that i 
should be terminated pilon said

here is a look at major achievements and failures 
of mikhail s gorbachev since he became soviet leader on march 11 
1985 
 
foreign policy 
switched the basis of foreign policy from a struggle with 
capitalist countries to cooperation in fulfilling universal human 
values such as the desire for peace and a better life 
abandoned the socalled brezhnev doctrine of military 
intervention in communist countries setting off a wave of 
revolutions in eastern europe that deposed oldstyle rulers and 
made the iron curtain division obsolete 
agreed to let a unified germany become a member of nato 
clearing the way for formal unification of the divided nation 
reduced fears of a superpower nuclear war or attack on europe 
or china by holding regular summit meetings with us and western 
european leaders and by ending a 30year chill in relations with 
china 
cut defense budget and unilaterally pulled 500000 troops and 
10000 tanks from europe later in a series of agreements with the 
united states and nato he promised to remove more troops tanks 
and warplanes from europe 
agreed with the united states to destroy shorter and 
mediumrange nuclear weapons and pursue more arms reductions 
agreements agreed to intrusive verification treaties 
withdrew 115000 troops from afghanistan 
stimulated settlement of conflicts in angola namibia 
cambodia and nicaragua moved to improve ties with japan south 
korea and israel 
 
democratization 
allowed wider freedom of press and assembly leading to an 
explosion of opposition groups many of which turn to severe 
criticism of gorbachev his policies and the communist party 
allowed greater freedom of religion and reopening of churches 
across the country 
persuaded the communist party leadership to end its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power but fails to salvage 
its foundering credibility 
created the soviet unions first working national legislature 
and allowed the soviet unions first nationwide competitive 
elections in 1989 
won approval from the same legislature for broad new 
presidential powers including the right to impose emergency 
economic reforms and suspend republic parliaments 
freed hundreds of political prisoners and largely ended 
persecution for political views 
increased the possibility for soviets to travel to other 
countries but has not yet given the legislature the final version 
of a promised law on free entry and exit 
 
economic policy 
has failed to improve daily life of ordinary soviet citizens 
as shortages have worsened and inflation and rationing have 
increased delayed needed reform of soviet prices which have 
little relation to actual costs and waste scarce resources 
won parliamentary approval for the leasing of land to 
individuals with the right of inheritance but has not yet won 
approval for the private ownership of land 
eased foreign investment through approval of joint ventures 
but has not approved full foreign ownership of property and 
profits 
legalized small private business cooperatives but failed to 
provide them with adequate legal sources of supplies 
revealed the longsecret soviet budget deficit and let it 
grow to 90 billion rubles about 150 billion at official exchange 
rate this year 
 
domestic policy 
sent thousands of soldiers into peacekeeping duties in their 
own country but failed to halt ethnic and nationalist conflicts 
that have killed some 500 people in the last two years 
agreed to discuss eventual lithuanian independence with 
leaders of the baltic republic after imposing an economic blockade 
over its declaration of independence faced similar demands for 
independence or sovereignty from most of the 12 other republics 
including russia 
has failed so far to halt official corruption and the soaring 
violent crime rate although has used broad presidential powers to 
order tougher police action 
used his powers to order a crackdown on black marketeering 
and demanded state firms fulfill their orders for supplies to state 
enterprises 
has failed so far to follow through on promises to improve the 
quality of the soviet unions polluted water air and land 
has failed so far to have adequate housing built for the 
population which has suffered from decades of overcrowded living 
conditions

a former air force sergeant convicted of 
aggravated assault for homosexual conduct while knowingly infected 
with an aidsrelated virus lost a supreme court appeal monday 
the justices without comment let stand nathaniel johnson jrs 
conviction dishonorable military discharge and sixyear prison 
sentence 
johnson was stationed at mcchord air force base in washington 
state when in 1987 he tested positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv which is believed to cause acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome or aids 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections no one is known to have recovered from aids 
johnson was a patient at the wilford hall medical center at 
lackland air force base in texas when the air force adopted a 
policy that held out the possibility of disciplinary action for 
hivinfected military members who did not practice safe sex 
lawyers for johnson say he never was told about the policy 
after returning to mcchord johnson engaged in homosexual 
conduct with a 17yearold boy he had met in a tacoma bar 
tried by general courtmartial at mcchord in early 1988 johnson 
was convicted of consensual sodomy he also was convicted of 
aggravated assault and attempted sodomy he was sentenced to 10 
years in prison 
the us air force court of military review threw out the 
attempted consensual sodomy conviction after ruling that the charge 
essentially duplicated the aggravated assault charge 
the court reduced johnsons sentence to six years and its 
ruling was upheld by the us court of military appeals last april 
in seeking help from the nations highest court lawyers for 
johnson said the portion of the uniform code of military justice 
used to prosecute him for aggravated assault is impermissibly vague 
when applied to the possible transmission of a virus 
they said the offense of aggravated assault never was intended 
to be used against someone accused of transmitting a contagious 
disease unless there is a clear intent to spread the disease

gen michael j dugan fired last month as air 
force chief of staff for disclosing us contingency plans for war 
with iraq is working in the pentagon as an aide to air force 
secretary donald b rice a spokesman said monday 
dugan remains on active duty and has been working as a special 
assistant to rice since shortly after defense secretary dick cheney 
fired dugan on sept 17 said air force spokesman col joe purka 
the matter of dugans status arose after cheney said during a 
radio interview in london on monday that dugan is no longer in 
the air force 
cheney was responding to an interviewers question about whether 
the united states would considering targeting iraqi president 
saddam hussein with military force as a way of reversing the iraqi 
occupation of kuwait among the remarks made by dugan that led to 
his firing was that us contingency plans included massive air 
raids on baghdad that would target saddam and his family 
cheney said in the interview that us policy forbids targeting 
of foreign leaders 
when reminded of dugans statement cheney said hes no 
longer in the air force 
dugan a 32year veteran and former fighter pilot maintains his 
rank as fourstar general until president bush formally nominates 
him for retirement and the senate acts on the nomination purka 
said bush had not yet made the nomination 
if the senate does not act within 90 days of the date of dugans 
firing his rank would slip to major general purka said major 
general is two notches below general

president mikhail s gorbachev won the 1990 
nobel peace prize today for his decisive role in the dramatic 
rapprochement between east and west leadership that helped end 
the cold war free the east bloc and slow the arms race 
in awarding the 59yearold soviet leader the 700000 prize 
the norwegian nobel committee also cited him for allowing greater 
openness in his homeland 
gorbachev said today the prize the first to a superpower chief 
executive since president woodrow wilson won in 1919 recognized 
the success of perestroika his governments reform policies 
words fail one at such moments i am moved the official 
soviet news agency tass quoted gorbachev as saying 
when we were starting our perestroika gorbachev said we 
knew that it would have vast significance to all countries he 
said he will personally accept the award in oslo 
in its citation the norwegian nobel committee said it decided 
to give gorbachev the prize for his leading role in the peace 
process 
the committee noted dramatic changes have occurred over the 
past few years in the relationship between east and west saying 
confrontation has been replaced by negotiations old european 
nation states have regained freedom the arms race is slowing down 
and we see a definite and active process in the direction of arms 
control and disarmament 
the committee said several factors played a role in the historic 
changes but this year it was singling out gorbachev for his many 
and decisive contributions 
this peace process the citation said opens up new 
possibilities for the world community to solve its pressing 
problems across ideological religious historical and cultural 
dividing lines 
gidske anderson leader of the nobel committee refused to say 
if the prize was meant to help gorbachev stay in power as the same 
domestic policies that have democratized political life also have 
led to instability 
if you will read the text you will see we are talking mainly 
about international policy ms anderson said 
the big thing that is happening in the world is the 
reconciliation of the superpowers we are very happy to come with a 
laureate who has such great significance 
gorbachev is the second soviet to win the peace prize the first 
was nuclear scientist and human rights activist andrei sakharov 
who won in 1975 sakharov who died in december could not accept 
the award for 14 years until gorbachev freed him from internal 
exile and allowed him to travel 
sakharovs widow yelena bonner criticized gorbachev last week 
in a norwegian newspaper comparing him to napoleon who conquered 
europe and made himself an emperor today she had no comment on 
gorbachevs win 
initial reaction today favored the choice of gorbachev for the 
prize 
in washington president bush praised the soviet leader saying 
the united states continues to work with the soviet union to 
promote regional and international peace 
president mikhail gorbachev has been a courageous force for 
peaceful change in the world bush said eastwest relations 
hold greater promise for peace and world stability today than at 
any time in the last 45 years 
former president ronald reagan said gorbachev won the award 
because of his bold and courageous leadership and added i 
congratulate my friend on his wonderful recognition of his 
accomplishments 
since our first meeting in geneva nearly five years ago i 
have found mikhail gorbachev to be sincere in his effort to make 
the world safer especially by reducing nuclear weapons 
stockpiles reagan said in a statement 
lech walesa the 1983 peace laureate who is campaigning to 
become polands first popularly elected president sent 
congratulations to gorbachev saying he was pleased the world has 
recognized his great work 
the solidarity leader wished gorbachev further persistence and 
successes on the road to democracy 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said the selection 
of gorbachev was terrific 
and chancellor helmut kohl said germany has a special reason to 
thank gorbachev for lifting soviet objections to german 
unification we germans have grounds to be thankful to you 
and are delighted along with your countrymen over this award 
kohl said 
president vaclev havel of czechoslovakia who had been 
considered a leading candidate for the prize said 
mikhail gorbachev contributed significantly to the 
acceleration of the inevitable changes in the soviet union and 
eastern europe and certainly deserves the prize if this prize 
contributes to the peaceful and quiet transition of the soviet 
union to a society of equal nations and citizens we welcome it 
warmly 
in its citation the nobel committee said the greater 
openness gorbachev has brought about in soviet society has also 
helped promote international trust 
however the changes gorbachev has encouraged at home have been 
accompanied by bloody ethnic conflicts in armenia azerbaijan and 
other areas and his economic reforms the transformation to a 
marketbased system is still far off have led to shortages of 
consumer goods 
the prize was endowed by alfred nobel the swedish inventor of 
dynamite and has been awarded since 1901 he established four 
other prizes in medicine literature physics and chemistry which 
are awarded in stockholm sweden 
the nobel memorial prize in economic science established by the 
central bank of sweden in 1968 will be awarded tuesday the nobel 
physics and chemistry prizes will be awarded wednesday 
last week mexican poet and essayist octavio paz won the prize 
for literature two american doctors joseph e murray and e 
donnall thomas won the prize in medicine for pioneering organ and 
bone marrow transplants 
the awards are presented in oslo and stockholm on dec 10 the 
anniversary of nobels death in 1896

the norwegian nobel committee has decided to award the 1990 
nobel peace prize to mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev president of 
the soviet union for his leading role in the peace process which 
today characterizes important parts of the international community 
during the last few years dramatic changes have taken place in 
the relationship between east and west confrontation has been 
replaced by negotiations old european nation states have regained 
freedom the arms race is slowing down and we see a definite and 
active process in the direction of arms control and disarmament 
several regional conflicts have been solved or have at least come 
closer to solution the un is beginning to play the role which 
was originally planned for it in an international community 
governed by law 
these historic changes spring from several factors but in 1990 
the nobel committee wants to honor mikhail gorbachev for his many 
and decisive contributions the greater openness he has brought 
about in soviet society has also helped promote international 
trust 
in the opinion of the committee this peace process which 
gorbachev has contributed so significantly to opens up new 
possibilities for the world community to solve its pressing 
problems across ideological religious historical and cultural

a tribal judge told jurors today that 
all elements of a charge must be proved to find suspended navajo 
chairman peter macdonald guilty saying its like needing all the 
ingredients to make navajo fry bread 
if you are making fry bread you have to have certain 
elements flour water salt and baking powder judge robert 
yazzie said if you have one element missing your case is not 
proven 
like making fry bread if you dont have the salt the bread 
will be tasteless 
closing arguments in the bribery and kickback trial that began 
oct 1 were scheduled for later in the day 
yazzie read the legal definitions of bribery in political 
matters theft by extortion the ethics violation of accepting 
gifts or loans in an effort to influence and conspiracy 
one law he outlined said a tribal official could accept gifts 
based on a social relationship but tribal law prohibits any 
official from accepting a gift service or other benefit of more 
than 100 during any calendar year from persons doing business with 
the tribe 
the prosecution contends macdonald 61 illegally asked for and 
accepted cash payments loans plane rides and use of an automobile 
from businessmen operating on the reservation 
the defense argued that macdonald received the money and other 
favors through friendship with the givers and that their acceptance 
was not linked to any threat or promises from macdonald 
the prosecution rested its case friday after presenting its 23rd 
and final witness on thursday 
the defense announced it would call no witnesses defense 
lawyers said they believed the prosecution failed to prove its 
case 
with the dismissal of three counts against macdonald on friday 
42 counts remain pending against macdonald his son rocky an 
unemployed lawyer who lives in san jose calif faces 23 counts of 
bribery theft by extortion ethics violation and conspiracy 
macdonald was placed on administrative leave in 1989 by the 
tribal council after allegations of corruption surfaced midway 
through his fourth fouryear term he and former chairman peterson 
zah are on the nov 6 ballot for the newly created post of tribal 
president

soviet citizens rushing from store to store monday 
seeking food clothes and other essentials expressed as much anger 
as pride over mikhail s gorbachev winner of this years nobel 
peace prize 
for worldpeace and disarmament he has done an awful lot but 
for his own people he hasnt done much said bela 53 a subway 
rider who declined to give her last name 
around the world hes popular of course but here hes 
not she added gesturing at grimfaced passengers carrying 
halffull shopping bags 
most of the 15 soviets interviewed in moscow streets markets 
subways and apartment buildings praised gorbachev for his role in 
raising the iron curtain and ending the cold war 
but they expressed anger over his domestic policies which they 
blamed for ethnic violence inflation and shortages of staples 
ranging from gasoline to instant coffee 
i dont know much about politics but what i see in the 
stores i hold the government responsible for said lyova 
likacheva a 35yearold factory worker 
and what i see in the stores is nothing theyre empty 
gorbachev told television reporters the prize would help on an 
emotional and intellectual level to raise support for his 
economic reforms 
but many of the soviets interviewed said they believed he had 
received the award solely for his foreign policy the nobel 
committee said his role in international affairs was the main 
reason for the prize but also praised him for promoting greater 
openness in the soviet union 
the news that gorbachev had won the prize spread quickly through 
the city and seemed to take most people by surprise there had been 
virtually no speculation in the soviet press about gorbachevs 
possible receipt of the 700000award 
arkady i sokolov a 62yearold machinist was one of the few 
people interviewed who smiled broadly on hearing that gorbachev was 
the first soviet to win the peace prize since dissident physicist 
andrei sakharov in 1975 
he deserves it sokolov said armaments are being reduced 
everywhere thats the main thing of course im proud of 
him 
andrei tatishchev 23 said he felt no such pride 
in international affairs i think hes done everything right 
its domestically that there is disorder tatishchev said 
i would be proud of him if he put things in this country in 
order what happens there outside our borders doesnt interest me 
very much as an ordinary russian person 
lena somochkina 17 and her classmate tanya fokina said they 
thought gorbachev deserved the award for reducing the chances of 
nuclear war allowing freedom of speech and encouraging reform 
throughout the east bloc 
he somehow turned our government around completely 
somochkina said we used to live behind an iron curtain if 
gorbachev hadnt come to power who knows whether there would have 
been reforms in eastern europe 
the only thing that gorbachev has maybe done wrong 
fokina added was to undertake hesitant economic reforms that have 
led to near chaos and for that she mostly blamed his aides and 
government bureaucrats 
i think they havent let him the people around him in the 
government havent given him the freedom to do what he wants 
she said

the president of the world wildlife fund 
kathryn s fuller has ants in her plants 
so do lots of people but the insects fuller noticed crawling 
across her desk last year apparently are a brandnew species never 
before seen by ant experts 
this means scientists at the fund which is dedicated to 
preserving wildlife and its habitat around the globe have a new 
task right in their own washington headquarters making sure the 
ants survive 
the story began when eo wilson a zoology professor at harvard 
university and a leading authority on ants visited fullers 
office wilson a world wildlife fund board member had just 
completed an exhaustive work entitled the ants 
fuller asked wilson to check out her ants 
eds eyebrows just shot up when he saw them fuller says 
he immediately identified the ants as members of the genus 
pheidole a neotropical group on which he has specialized we 
traced the ants to their colony in a potted plant behind my desk 
the two collected some worker ants in a vial so wilson could 
study them in his lab later he asked that some soldier ants be 
collected and sent to him at harvard to aid in species 
identification 
this is a very surprising find and certainly distinctive 
wilson said in a statement issued monday by the fund 
if the preliminary results are confirmed by final taxonomic 
tests wwf officials said the new species could wind up being 
called fullers ant 
i will feel a very personal sense of responsibility for these 
ants whether or not theyre named after me the fund president 
said 
the potted plant where the ants live was a palm tree identified 
by world wildlife fund botanists as a draceana reflexa the ant 
colony could have come with the palm from florida or possibly was 
imported with another plant and migrated to the draceana in 
fullers office 
on advice from wilson fuller is feeding the ants sugar water 
and apple cores along with cheese cookies and an occasional 
danish 
fund botanists have added to the planter with the host palm tree 
some neotropical flora that secrete a substance harvested by 
similar ants in the wild 
im telling people m creating a complete tropical ecosystem 
in here fuller said it shows you how little is known about 
diversity in the world how many species are unknown 
the world wildlife fund describes itself as the largest private 
conservation organization with projects in more than 140 countries 
to protect wildlife and its habitat 
so its leaders are determined to save the ants 
ive given the plant company strict instructions not to touch 
my plant fuller said the caretaker told me most of his 
clients want their plants antfree i was the first person to ever 
tell him to leave the ants alone

cambodias vietnameseinstalled 
government has criticized what it calls an attempt by the us 
state department to pressure cambodian dancers to defect during 
their us tour 
four members of the 36member classical dance troupe have 
defected during the tour the troupe was to complete its 
performances in new york sunday to end the tour the first cultural 
exchange between the united states and cambodia since the vietnam 
war 
the state department says it plans to interview all the dancers 
to determine if they really want to return home 
we regret this action of the us department of state which 
is a form of political pressure to serve a political goal said a 
foreign ministry statement carried by the cambodian broadcast 
we would like to stress that these dancers like other 
cambodian people are free to choose their domiciles without 
pressure from any foreign government the statement said 
a transcript of sundays broadcast was seen in bangkok monday 
the communist cambodian government was installed by a vietnamese 
invasion in late 1978 citizens are not free to travel more than 
300000 refugees are in un camps just inside the thai border 
in a statement last week the bangkok office of resistance 
leader prince norodom sihanouk said the defections of the dancers 
symbolized the unpopularity and the lack of freedom and democracy 
in this vietnamese tankinstalled regime

president bush today warned saddam hussein that 
iraqi atrocities in kuwait could lead to trials similar to those 
held after world war ii 
hitler revisited bush said of iraqi actions 
but remember when hitlers war ended there were the nuremberg 
trials every day now new word filters out about the ghastly 
atrocities perpetrated by saddams forces he said 
the presidents remarks came at a fundraising luncheon for 
businessman clayton williams the republican candidate for governor 
of texas 
his victory will be a triumph for the oldfashioned virtues 
that made this state what it is bush said about williams 
williams is the frontrunner in the race against democrat ann 
richards republican gov william clements is not running for 
reelection 
the president also will be stumping for candidates in nebraska 
iowa illinois and michigan during the twoday political trip 
bush mixed high praise for williams with an attack on congress 
for not coming up with a budget bill to his liking 
thirtyseven times in the last 10 years congress has missed 
its own budget deadline bush said this friday times up 
with that the president hinted he would not sign another 
continuing resolution that would keep the government operating in 
the absence of a budget agreement 
by the end of this week the president and congress must come up 
with 500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the 
federal deficit over the next five years 
in the race for governor of texas one of the states bush calls 
home williams has spent at least 16 million including 75 
million since march richards has spent at least 94 million 
including 57 million since march 
at least 6 million of the total williams has spent has been his 
own money 
an independent poll made public late last week said williams was 
leading richards by 51 percent to 40 percent 
why bother going to texas 
its the presidents home state and it plays a major role in 
presidential politics said michele davis executive director of 
the republican governors association once the dust clears after 
the election everybody wants to be able to point to texas and be 
able to say they played a role in a big win 
the nasty tone of the texas race was demonstrated last week when 
the two rivals had a rare joint appearance and williams used to the 
occasion to say im here to call you a liar today youve 
lied about me williams was angered that richards had questioned 
his relationship with a houston loan broker under investigation by 
the fbi for alleged moneylaundering 
williams was in the best shape of the candidates bush was trying 
to help 
in nebraska republican gov kay orr was trailing her democratic 
challenger businessman ben nelson the most recent survey done for 
the omaha worldherald said nelson led mrs orr by 8 percentage 
points 44 percent to 36 percent 
the first republican woman elected governor of any state mrs 
orr got into trouble when she backed a tax increase after pledging 
throughout her campaign to hold the line against new taxes 
she had to apologize said davis who insisted that mrs orr 
has been able to prove that taxes are down since she took 
office and that nebraska now has the nations lowest unemployment 
rate 
davis said nelson had outspent orr 21 on television 
also benefiting from the presidential visit to nebraska were 
former congressman hal daub who is challenging democratic sen 
james exon and ally milder who is challenging democratic rep 
peter hoagland 
in iowa bush plans to campaign tuesday for gop gov terry 
branstad and rep tom tauke who is challenging democratic sen tom 
harkin 
bush is visiting illinois to help gubernatorial candidate jim 
edgar now secretary of state his last stop tuesday is in grand

largerthanlife campaign posters of 
ousted prime minister benazir bhutto her loyalists and political 
opponents clutter the pristine boulevards of the cities and the 
bumpy dirt roads to the villages 
colorful party flags flutter atop mudandstraw huts modern 
highrise buildings on bicycles bullock carts and pickup trucks 
loudspeakers blare the slogans of favorite candidates 
despite all the trappings the campaign for the oct 24 
parliamentary election lacks the wide public enthusiam that 
heralded pakistans return to democracy two years ago 
this election is being fought in the courtroom not the 
countryside 
when president ghulam ishaq khan ousted ms bhutto on aug 6 and 
called the election three years early most pakistanis were pretty 
fed up with her performance and an ineffective parliament paralyzed 
by 20 months of bickering 
the caretaker government made up of former allies with little 
in common except contempt for ms bhutto thought it would produce 
enough evidence to prove she presided over pakistans most corrupt 
and inept government 
they boasted she would be forced out of politics for seven 
years maybe forever and the leftleaning pakistan peoples party 
founded by her father the late prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto 
would be destroyed 
government lawyers crossed the country filing charge after 
charge against the 37yearold former prime minister six former 
cabinet ministers and ultimately her husband 
but even ms bhuttos strongest critics now privately admit the 
evidence is questionable and the credibilty of the caretakers 
called the undertakers by pakistans urdu and englishlanguage 
press has been called into doubt 
we wanted to make her the villian but instead shes becoming 
the victim said one government official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity now we are on trial and the verdict will be 
delivered oct 24 
promises of elections are the threads holding together the 
delicate fabric of pakistans democracy which unexpectedly 
returned in 1988 when the military dictator gen mohammad zia 
ulhaq died in a still unexplained plane crash 
progovernment newspapers and stateowned radio and television 
carry daily reassurances from ishaq khan and the powerful army 
chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg that the polls will be held 
on time come what may and that power will be transferred to the 
choice of the people irrespective of who wins 
but in a country ruled by the military for more than half its 
43year existence such promises have been broken too many time in 
the past to inspire confidence 
politicians hurl accusations and insults at each other instead 
of talking about the real issues that trouble this moslem country 
of 110 million people a soaring birthrate increasing poverty and 
rising prices that are putting many of the basic necessities out of 
reach 
the politicians certainly arent capable of running the 
country said imran rafiq bhatt a 25yearold charity worker in 
the eastern village of visvian we should give the country to 
japan on lease for eight years and maybe they could straighten 
things out 
the events surrounding ms bhuttos dismissal and her trials 
before the special tribunals resurrected from the days of martial 
law have only served to make pakistanis more cynical about the 
future 
but analysts say the caretaker government has become ms 
bhuttos best friend making her the underdog and helping halt and 
then reverse her declining popularity and galvanize the 
disillusioned rankandfile in her party 
ms bhutto the daughter of wealth and privilege is cast as the 
poor peoples sister the champion of freedom and democracy 
the scrappy fighter of political oppression 
it is a role she played so well for a decade after her father 
was overthrown in 1977 military coup and hanged two years later 
the daughter of wealth and privilege advocating freedom democracy 
and people power 
while the caretaker government was busy trying to collect facts 
and figures in a bureaucratic manner she crisscrossed the country 
in a pajero jeep inching through the surging suffocating crowds 
and appealing to the sentiments of the people then traveling all 
night to her next court appearance 
soon the stories of largescale corruption and mismangement 
began to fade and sympathy for her grow 
her appeal is direct sentimental and downtoearth she still 
carries the day said political analyst syed alamdar raza the 
coalition in power and her opponents who want to be in power have 
no one who comes anywhere near her 
when she was in power and times were good ms bhutto said in an 
interview she occasionally thought about the day when she would 
give up politics to devote time to her young children son bilawal 
and daughter bakhtawar 
now is not the time to talk or even think about retirement 
she said during a weeklong campaign swing through eastern punjab 
the countrys most prosperous province and home to more than 60 
million pakistanis 
government officials and bureaucrats admit privately they 
underestimated her drive her ambition and her steely 
determination 
even her most bitter opponents calculate she and the peoples 
party will win about 80 seats in the 217member national assembly 
the lawmaking lower house of parliament that chooses the prime 
minister that would fall short of an outright majority but most 
likely make hers the largest single party

the federal trade commission on monday 
challenged rr donnelley amp son companys acquisition of a smaller 
publishingprinting partnership saying it could substantially 
lessen competition in the highvolume publication field 
donnelley which has its headquarters in chicago bought the 
meredithburda companies for 570 million in a deal consummated on 
sept 4 the previous week the us district court denied the 
ftcs request for a preliminary injunction blocking the sale 
we were convinced at the very beginning when this sale was 
agreed upon in december 1989 that it did not present legal 
obstacles said james ratcliff donnelleys vice president for 
corporate affairs we think we were right on the facts of the 
law and that we have a good case and we will press on 
the ftc issued an administrative complaint that the acquisition 
created a firm whose share of the market is so high that it has 
become a dominant firm it said the deal will eliminate 
competition among other firms in the market 
rr donnelly is a printing firm specializing in highvolume 
publication gravure printing of the type used for long runs of 
magazines newspaper inserts and catalogues meredith corporation 
based in des moines is a magazine publisher which also owns seven 
television stations it is a partner in printing operations with 
the burda family of germany 
what donnelly bought was the printing operations ratcliff 
said we are not publishers included is a magazine printing 
plant in des moines and catalogue printing plants in lynchburg 
va newton nc and casa grande ariz 
an official in the ftcs bureau of competition who asked not to 
be named said the sale would give donnelly more than 50 percent of 
the market in at least one area 
the complaint also names meredith corp and pan associates lp 
which each owned 50 percent of meredithburda 
a federal judge turned down the ftcs request for a preliminary 
injunction against the sale on aug 27 but the ftc official said 
the courts ruling was just a preliminary assessment of the 
commissions likelihood of succeeding 
the new complaint will be heard before an administrative law 
judge whose ruling can be appealed to the full commission if the 
firms lose both decisions they can carry the case to a federal 
court

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev won 
the 1990 nobel peace prize on monday for easing international 
tensions but claimed it as an endorsement of wrenching changes he 
has made at home 
the norwegian nobel committee said the 59yearold soviet leader 
displayed a leading role in the peace process which today 
characterizes important parts of the international community 
words fail one at such moments i am moved gorbachev said 
in a television interview 
i perceive this action of the most authoritative organization 
of the global community first of all not in personal terms but as 
recognition of the significance of the immense cause of perestroika 
for the destiny of the entire world 
gorbachev has been criticized at home because some of his social 
and economic reforms called perestroika have led to bloody ethnic 
rioting food shortages and demands by most soviet republics for 
independence 
we know that there are great problems in the soviet union 
but that is not what he got his prize for said gidske anderson 
leader of the fiveperson nobel committee the big thing that is 
happening in the world is the reconciliation of the superpowers 
if you will read the text you will see we are talking mainly 
about international policy she said 
the committees citation said the greater openness gorbachev 
has brought about in soviet society has also helped promote 
international trust 
the committee said gorbachev had made many contributions to the 
dramatic changes in eastwest relationships since he came to 
power in 1985 
confrontation has been replaced by negotiations old european 
nation states have regained freedom the arms race is slowing down 
and we see a definite and active process in the direction of arms 
control and disarmament 
gorbachev told a norwegian tv interviewer his reforms were 
popular outside the soviet union because the world was ripe for 
change 
it had grown tired of the cold war the arms race the 
hardships resulting from an overload of current problems facing the 
world community he said 
in the past five years the soviet union has agreed to reduce 
nuclear and conventional armed forces helped settle regional 
conflicts in africa asia and latin america and withdrawn its 
forces from afghanistan 
many world leaders praised the award but several said they 
hoped it would lead to even more freedom in the soviet union 
if this prize contributes to the peaceful and quiet transition 
of the soviet union to a society of equal nations and citizens we 
welcome it warmly said vaclav havel a former dissident who 
became czechoslovakias president after the soviet union eased its 
grip on the east bloc 
former president reagan said gorbachev is sincere in his 
effort to make the world safer and is dedicated to doing what 
must be done for the good of his people 
president bush called gorbachev a courageous force for 
peaceful change in the world 
british prime minister margaret thatcher called the choice 
terrific and french president francois mitterrand said 
gorbachev was the decisive factor in the easing of tensions in 
the world 
some soviet citizens were less enthusiastic about the honor for 
gorbachev 
i dont know much about politics but what i see in the 
stores i hold the government responsible for said lyova 
likacheva a 35yearold moscow factory worker and what i see in 
the stores is nothing theyre empty 
the 71st peace prize was the first to a soviet leader us 
presidents theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson won the award in 
1906 and 1919 respectively 
gorbachev is the second soviet nobel peace laureate dissident 
andrei sakahorov won the 1975 prize but was not allowed to accept 
it until last year 
gorbachev said he would personally accept the award worth about 
700000 this december in oslo 
the peace prize first awarded in 1901 was endowed by alfred 
nobel the swedish inventor of dynamite it is always presented in 
oslo on the dec 10 anniversary of his 1896 death 
nobel endowed four other prizes in medicine literature 
physics and chemistry all awarded in stockholm sweden 
the nobel memorial prize in economic science established by the 
central bank of sweden in 1968 will be awarded tuesday the nobel 
physics and chemistry prizes will be awarded wednesday 
last week mexican poet and essayist octavio paz won the prize 
for literature two american doctors joseph e murray and e 
donnall thomas won the prize in medicine for pioneering organ and 
bone marrow transplants

president bush said monday that iraqi atrocities in kuwait could 
lead to trials similar to those held after world war ii and his 
defense secretary said us troops will stay in saudi arabia as 
long as needed 
iraq meanwhile insisted it would fight rather than withdraw 
from kuwait 
hitler revisited bush said in dallas of iraqi actions in 
the tiny emirate that saddam husseins troops seized aug 2 
but remember when hitlers war ended there were the nuremberg 
trials every day now new word filters out about the ghastly 
atrocities perpetrated by saddams forces bush said 
earlier monday us defense secretary richard cheney said 
americans would stay as long as the saudis want usas long as 
it takes to get the job done no one should underestimate our 
staying power 
time is much more likely to be on our side than it is on his 
side cheney said referring to saddam and the usled 
multinational force 
asked if there was the political will in the united states to 
maintain troops in saudi arabia for years cheney said there 
certainly is 
the defense secretary who spoke in london as part of a 10day 
tour that also will take him to moscow said economic sanctions 
were only just beginning to hurt iraq he stressed that america 
hopes to avoid war 
iraq denied it was softening its stance on the gulf crisis 
kuwait is the 19th province of iraq and this fact will not be 
changed whatsoever even if we fight a long war for that 
information minister lafif nassayif jassim was quoted as saying 
he told reporters in baghdad sunday night that he believes a 
usled attack is imminent but that iraq would not fire the first 
shot the official iraqi news agency reported 
we expect the war at any moment and we are ready to fight 
against the americans and those who come with them he said 
an editorial in althawra the newspaper of the ruling arab 
baath socialist party said iraqis are prepared to meet the 
american troops 
if they start the war we will make it a catastrophe for those 
who ignite it the editorial said the destruction will be 
total 
should fighting break out the statement said all the 
american interests and those of its allies inside and outside the 
region will explode and the fires will eat them at the first hour 
of their aggression against iraq 
the iraqi statement appeared intended to reassure its citizens 
and counter reports that saddam might be wavering in his 
determination to hold onto kuwait palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat met with saddam on sunday and 
said later that the iraqi president was showing a certain 
flexibility regarding his claims to kuwait 
arafat spoke in tunis after meeting with the french foreign 
minister diplomatic sources in baghdad said arafat is trying to 
persuade the iraqis to talk with the french who suggested iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait might be linked to an israeli withdrawal 
from the west bank and gaza strip 
saddam said aug 12 that he would discuss a withdrawal from 
kuwait only if talks also were held on the palestinian issue the 
west bank and gaza are home to 17 million palestinians 
the official soviet novosti press agency said saddam had 
indicated to soviet envoy yevgeny primakov that he might remove his 
troops in exchange for some kuwaiti territory on the gulf 
that report is not precise jassim said of the novosti 
dispatch 
in other developments monday 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told soviet 
lawmakers the kremlin has no plans to join the multinational force 
in the gulf and assured them any such deployment would require 
their approval 
the soviet leadership has no plan for participation in a 
military operation he said 
in jiddah saudi arabia the wife of the kuwaiti planning 
minister said iraq is fencing off the northern part of kuwait 
the iraqis are setting up a wire fence across kuwait they 
apparently plan to gulp up bubiyan and the northeastern oilfield 
said fatima hussein who fled kuwait last week and was among 750 
businessmen economists and politicians at a threeday conference 
on their countrys future 
the french foreign ministry reported iraqi soldiers have 
emptied the rooftop cistern holding the water for the french 
embassy in kuwait the building now has no water electric or 
telephone service and rice is the only remaining food the 
ministry said 
iraqs ambassador to france abdul razzak alhashimi denied 
that the cistern had been emptied 
spain became the first european community country to see all 
its hostages safely out of iraq when 15 spaniards reached jordan 
accompanied by a fivemember private delegation that won their 
release from baghdad seven spanish diplomats voluntarily remained 
behind 
there are more than 600 american hostages in kuwait and about 
300 in iraq 
prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan said his government is 
considering whether the constitution can be interpreted to allow 
deployment overseas of armed japanese troops under un auspices 
the constitution written during the us occupation after world 
war ii prohibits the use of force to settle international 
disputes

iraqi crewmen 
of a container ship cursed members of a us boarding team leading 
to tense moments before the vessels master agreed to change 
course navy officers say 
in another reported incident us marines for the first time 
joined in a boarding party by fastroping from a hovering 
helicopter onto the deck of an iraqi ship in the northern arabian 
sea 
in nearly nine weeks since the un embargo against iraq began 
the multinational force of naval ships has intercepted 2350 
commercial vessels nearly 40 a day us military spokesmen said 
they said they could not provide a breakdown by members of the 
multinational force nor any updated figures on the number of 
boardings or diversions of ships 
the us warships are part of an international flotilla 
enforcing the un embargo which was imposed in response to iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
the majority of boardings have occurred in the red sea mainly 
along the approaches to jordans key port of aqaba 
despite jordans assurances to the contrary us officers say 
some prohibited cargoes appear to be slipping through aqaba and 
being taken overland to iraq 
the roberts the frigate uss elmer montgomery and greek and 
spanish frigates are serving as embargo gatekeepers for ships 
entering and leaving the strait of tiran which leads into the gulf 
of aqaba 
the 3600ton roberts based at newport ri has conducted 
about 40 boardings itself and one previous diversion of the 
sudanese freighter blue nile in the tiran strait oct 5 
the tense confrontation occurred friday when a combined 
navycoast guard team from the roberts boarded the 24302ton 
qatarflagged container ship barzan after following it for eight 
hours as it headed toward aqaba 
cmdr john w townes iii captain of the roberts said sunday 
that some members of the barzans crew identified as iraqis 
verbally abused the americans using a lot of fourletter 
words 
he said the situation never got out of hand 
it got close but the boarding party has learned that the best 
thing is to step away he said 
the barzan which had picked up cargo in the united states and 
spain en route to the region agreed to divert to the saudi port of 
jiddah after its cargo manifest was found to be unclear as to the 
ultimate destination of some goods on board townes said 
us military spokesmen said marines from the amphibious landing 
dock ship uss ogden climbed down by rope onto the iraqiflagged 
tanker almutanabbi on saturday after it was intercepted by the 
ogden the frigate uss brewton and the australian missile frigate 
hmas darwin 
once the marines secured the 66155ton tanker inspection teams 
from the brewton and darwin boarded from small boats 
after determining that almutanabbi was empty of cargo the 
boarding teams departed and the ship was cleared to proceed a 
statement said 
a navy spokesman in the saudi city of dhahran cmdr jd van 
sickle said he did not know why the marines were involved the 
ogden which carries about 900 marines is among 18 ships in a 
marine amphibious task force in the north arabian sea

arizona voters will try to do what their elected 
leaders have failed at for 15 years put the costly and divisive 
martin luther king holiday issue to rest one way or the other 
arizona is one of just three states with montana and new 
hampshire that have not made the late civil rights leaders 
birthday a state holiday in some form congress designated the 
third monday in january a federal holiday in 1983 
repeated attempts at making king day a holiday have died in the 
arizona legislature since the first effort failed in 1975 
amid concern that the dispute has hurt the state economically 
pollsters and politicians now believe voters will give their 
blessing nov 6 to a ballot measure adopting the holiday 
a rival ballot measure would ratify legislation creating a paid 
king holiday for state workers but eliminate a paid columbus day 
polls show scant support for that idea 
all sides including impeached gov evan mecham who is a leading 
opponent have said they will abide by the outcome 
the republican and democratic gubernatorial candidates favor a 
king day mecham who created a storm during his tenure as governor 
by eliminating a king holiday created by his predecessor lost his 
bid to regain the governors office in the sept 11 reublican 
primary 
theres a feeling here that the only thing worse than giving 
them the holiday is not giving it to them said jim tidwell 
chairman of the republican party in gila county 
there are also just a hell of a lot of people who feel that 
america is a leading nation in civil rights and that we ought to 
honor that said pheonix pollster earl de berge 
de berge said his own polls show voters favor the holiday by 
about a 5to3 margin a poll by the arizona republic found 55 
percent in favor of king day and 42 percent opposed 
a poll by the newspaper conducted sept 1316 found only 18 
percent of 601 registered voters surveyed favored the kingcolumbus 
day swap 
if both ballot measures are approved the one with the greater 
number of yes votes wins if both are rejected the 
longestablished columbus day would be retained and arizonans 
would have no paid king holiday 
the outcome could end a struggle that has divided the state 
since the first king holiday bill was introduced and defeated in 
1975 
former gov bruce babbitt a democrat created the holiday by 
executive order just before he left office in 1986 
but mecham armed with an attorney generals opinion that 
babbitts order was illegal rescinded it days after he took office 
in january 1987 
mecham subsequently issued his own executive order setting 
aside the third sunday in january as an unpaid holiday to honor 
king but it never was recognized by supporters of a paid holiday 
mecham was impeached and removed from office for unrelated actions 
in 1988 
the legislature created a paid king holiday in october 1989 but 
did away with the states paid columbus day holiday to avoid the 
expense of giving state workers an additional paid day off 
that touched off a firestorm among arizonas italianamericans 
who helped gather enough petition signatures to place the issue 
before the voters on nov 6 
lawmakers passed a second bill in may establishing the king 
holiday and keeping columbus day in hopes of heading off the 
public vote 
but another referendum drive this one headed by mecham 
succeeded in collecting enough signatures to place the second 
measure on the ballot as well

federal payments to doctors and hospitals 
would go down driving up costs to patients the government would 
be less generous to farmers and college students and under the 
budget deal brewing in congress a broad range of fees would 
increase from tourists entering the country to inventors filing 
for new patents 
in fact virtually all americans would be likely to find 
themselves digging deeper into their pockets 
rudolf g penner a senior fellow at the urban institute and 
former director of the congressional budget office sees a silver 
lining concerning the higher costs theyre pretty widespread so 
they shouldnt be intensely felt by any particular group or 
individual 
the proposals are contained in separate budgetcutting bills the 
house and senate are girding to debate this week the packages are 
aimed at paring the federal deficit by 40 billion in the budget 
year that began oct 1 by 500 billion over the next five years 
so far the tax increases contained in the plans have received 
most of the publics attention with democrats and republicans 
vying to show the voters that the rich will pay their fair share 
but its not just tax increases that the average american would 
notice should lawmakers and president bush finally reach a 
deficitreduction agreement 
in fact most of the savings in the packages congress plans to 
vote on come from spending reductions 
among the programs hardest hit would be medicare which helps 33 
million elderly and handicapped americans pay their medical bills 
increases in the program one of the fastest growing in the 
government would be held to 43 billion to 49 billion below the 
amount needed to keep pace with inflation over the next five years 
although details of the congressional plans differ it seems 
certain that the reimbursements doctors and hospitals receive for 
treating medicare patients will be restrained 
the senate finance committee bill for example would hold 
increases in payments to hospitals to 32 percent in 1991 2 
percent below the expected rate of inflation for hospital costs 
reimbursements to family doctors would increase by just 2 percent 
next year while payments to specialists such as surgeons would 
be frozen at this years levels 
with their federal reimbursements reduced doctors and hospitals 
could be forced to pass their costs onto patients all patients 
the government limits the ability of healthcare providers to boost 
costs for medicare recipients 
medicare patients themselves are being singled out by the budget 
writers the 75 they must pay each year in doctors bills before 
the government begins picking up the tab would increase to 150 
next year under the senate finance bill 100 under the house 
democratic plan 
farmers would also be hit by a significant reduction in federal 
agriculture subsidies totaling 136 billion over the next five 
years 
although details were not final lawmakers tentatively decided 
to reduce acreage eligible for crop subsidies by 15 percent for 
each farmer beginning in 1992 
they also agreed to reduce the subsidies in another way by 
changing the formula by which farmers receive payments when market 
prices are low the five subsidized crops are wheat corn feed 
grains rice and cotton 
college students would also find the guaranteed student loan 
program stingier under a measure approved monday by the house 
education and labor committee 
the loans which go to 3 million students at colleges graduate 
schools and trade schools would no longer be available at 
schools where more than 35 percent of students have defaulted that 
is expected to end the program at about 1000 schools 
the committee also decided to reduce the yield banks receive 
from the government for making the federally backed loans this 
could discourage some lenders from making the money available to 
students 
other measures affecting consumers would 
end for five years the options civil service retirees have to 
receive their benefits in a lump sum people over age 64 with 30 
years of service would be exempted 
impose a 1 fee on tourists on planes or ships entering the 
united states including returning americans except for those 
traveling from canada mexico the caribbean or us possessions 
increase us patent office fees for items such as patent 
applications

mikhail s gorbachev his eyes shining with 
pleasure said monday his nobel peace prize reflected worldwide 
recognition of the importance of his reforms for the destiny of 
the entire world 
gorbachevs 700000 prize came as he delayed shifting the 
soviet economy from a centrally planned to a market system while 
the nobel recognition was bound to raise his international 
prestige its effect was less certain in the soviet union which is 
plagued by consumer shortages and ethnic strife 
it will be an influence of an emotional and intellectual 
nature because it is an appreciation of the cause we are all 
working for all the more so because this award coincides in time 
with a most crucial stage in perestroika he said 
we are on the threshold of deep changes and reforms with 
regard to the economys transition to a market system 
gorbachev was expected to propose a new reform package monday to 
the supreme soviet but his speech was postponed until friday 
the soviet president said he received the news of the award from 
norwegian ambassador dagfinn stenseth at the kremlin gorbachev 
said he would travel to oslo to accept the award 
he strongly praised the other soviet peace laureate the late 
andrei d sakharov who was barred from collecting the prize in 
1975 a decade before gorbachev rose to power 
gorbachev recalled sakharov from internal exile 18 months into 
his administration 
gorbachev said that when he took office the world was ripe 
for change it had grown tired of the cold war the arms race 
the hardships resulting from an overload of current problems facing 
the world community 
and i consider that academician sakharov was in the first 
ranks of searchers for the answers that agitated peoples minds 
he said 
sakharovs widow yelena bonner who in an interview last week 
with a norwegian newspaper compared gorbachev to napoleon declined 
to comment on the award monday 
gorbachev appeared delighted as he stood before reporters 
speaking calmly and slowly 
i am deeply touched i perceive this action as a 
recognition of the immense value and the immense significance of 
the great cause of perestroika for the destiny of the entire 
world 
when we began our perestroika we came to the conclusion 
that we could not continue to live as we had lived that we needed 
deep transformations in all spheres of life he said 
even then we wanted to be understood correctly in that what 
we were going to do was bound to be of great significance for all 
countries for the entire world because it was happening in such a 
huge country as the soviet union which plays a great role and 
bears on its shoulders a great responsibility to the world 
community he said 
many soviets even those who support reform are skeptical of 
gorbachevs ability to transform the nation 
historian roy a medvedev a member of the supreme soviet said 
of the nobel prize that in internal affairs it wont have much 
significance 
most of about 15 soviets interviewed at random in moscow said 
that although gorbachev may have helped reduce world tension his 
contributions to his homeland were mixed 
in international affairs i think hes done everything right 
its domestically that there is disorder said andrei a 
tatishchev 23 
i would be proud of him if he put things in this country in 
order what happens there outside our borders doesnt interest me 
very much as an ordinary russian person tatishchev added 
shortly after the announcement gorbachev gave an interview to 
soviet and foreign television reporters the state news agency tass 
carried excerpts 
in the supreme soviet chamber chairman anatoly lukyanov waited 
78 minutes before informing lawmakers he had just learned that 
gorbachev had won the award 
the announcement was followed by seven seconds of mild applause 
comparatively brief in a chamber accustomed to long speeches and 
adulation 
medvedev later told reporters that lukyanov had not wanted to 
interrupt discussion of a report delivered by foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadaze 
a defeated gorbachev rival yegor k ligachev was observing the 
parliamentary debate when word broke he told reporters i have an 
extremely positive reaction then rushed away

when immigrant sam krichinsky arrived in 
baltimore in 1914 he says at the opening of the movie avalon 
it was the most beautiful place he had ever seen 
if audiences share krichinskys memory they can thank allen 
daviau as the films director of photography daviau was charged 
with transforming director barry levinsons rich script into 
equally evocative images 
perhaps no scene in avalon reveals daviaus artistry more 
than that first scene in which krichinsky armin muellerstahl 
portraying levinsons grandfather as a young man lands in electric 
park a 1914 exposition recreated for the film by production 
designer norman reynolds 
as the first reel unspools something looks off as krichinsky 
moves through electric park decorated with 18000 lights his body 
movements are slightly jumpy and the colors overly rich he walks 
at normal speed and yet it is clear we are not watching his actual 
arrival it is instead krichinskys recollection of it 
this is a very abstract stylized idealized memory hes 
having of brilliant lights said daviau whose cinematography won 
academy award nominations for steven spielbergs et the 
extraterrestrial the color purple and empire of the 
sun 
one of the things barry said was we have to find a way to 
distance the past sequences from the present of 1948 daviau 
said to avoid cinematic cliches he declined to use filtration or 
sepia toning 
what daviau pronounced daveeow did instead was film at 18 
frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames he then 
stretchprinted the film using every other frame twice 
its missing a third of the information that our 24frameper 
second mind is used to seeing and its being restored in an 
artificial way daviau said weve seen stretch printing in 
silent films for many many years the difference is you havent 
seen it in color 
daviau first used the technique making a bank commercial several 
years ago he still alternates between commercials and feature 
films 
its the best mixture in the world he said because 
commercials keep you busy they keep you in practice they make you 
a lot of money and you meet a lot of directors who are on their way 
to doing pictures 
working in commercials allows you to be choosy about what 
movies you do what i was really looking to do happened when 
avalon came along 
i really am fascinated with the 40s daviau said i got 
to deal with a period that i remember quite well 
the movie spans 50 years detailing the lives of the 
krinchinskys levinsons family and the world in which they 
live 
daviau started as a still photographer photo lab technician and 
theatrical lighting designer during the mid1960s he photographed 
rock promotional films with jimi hendrix aretha franklin and the 
who other feature credits include the falcon and the snowman 
and defending your life in 1988 the american society of 
cinematographers voted him best cinematographer in feature films 
levinson and spielberg both are visual directors daviau said 
but have different styles 
steven is much more interested in the design of the shot the 
graphics are very very important to him daviau said barry is 
a visual director by all means but its a different emphasis he 
loves the compositions 
the cinematographers job is a curious one 
its really a case of choosing to make your presence known 
and you pick a look for a film and then youre out to make that 
look fit daviau said 
there are certain things that general audiences may notice 
about photography that are not the things you do a lot of times 
were credited with scenery the things we really do are things 
that people rarely notice most of our work is lighting color 
texture 
one of the greatest things that you do in cinematography is 
you guide the audiencess eye to where it should be youre giving 
emphasis where its desired 
i dont think i would ever want to be known as every film i 
have looking the same or somebody saying oh daviau did that for 
sure id much rather shape the look to the individual film 
in avalon he said certain details demanded to be examined 
closely 
i looked at armin muellerstahls face and in a second i saw 
those eyes this is one of the most remarkable faces ive ever been 
given to photograph 
for the thanksgiving dinner scenes in avalon daviau bathed 
the interiors with warm comfortable light pouring in from outside 
windows is cold blue light 
near the films end sam krichinsky settles into a chair to read 
a newspaper a few seconds later when he arises hes aged 10 
years the framing of both shots is identical there is no jump in 
the image even though the two scenes were done more than a week 
apart so seamless is the transition that some in the audience 
dont notice for several moments that krichinskys grown old 
and that for daviau is photography at its best

the little town of le chambonsurlignon now has a 
scroll of honor and 30 villagers have medals a halfcentury after 
they and their neighbors saved 5000 jews from nazi persecution 
israeli ambassador ovadia soafer presented the medals of 
righteousness to townspeople who risked their lives as they 
sheltered jews on the run from 1940 through 1944 
you gave a lesson of courage and dignity but also a political 
lesson which statesmen of the entire world should retain and apply 
as a rule of conduct dont give in to threats dont let youself 
be intimidated soafer said at sundays ceremony 
the entire town in addition to its scroll will be honored oct 
22 at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem 
it is the first community in france to be recognized 
collectively by the yad vashem institute which customarily honors 
individual nonjews who took risks on behalf of jews during world 
war ii 
marie brottes 84 said she and her neighbors mostly poor 
protestant peasants simply did what the bible advised 
you had to see those poor jews who arrived with nothing no 
clothes no possessions no family we helped them because its 
written in the gospel thats what gave us the courage and strength 
to do what we did she said in a telephone interview 
just 11 weeks after france fell to the germans the 
collaborationist vichy government passed laws discriminating 
against jews by 1945 80000 jews had been deported to nazi death 
camps only 2500 returned 
sheltering mainly children at first the people of le chambon 
turned no one away betrayed no one attempted to convert no one 
mrs brottes and other villagers recall the wartime events in 
the weapons of the spirit a documentary film about how 
through word of mouth the quiet mountain community in central 
france became a place of refuge for 5000 jews 
the 90minute film shown in france for the first time last 
week was screened in le chambon before an audience of rescuers and 
survivors many never reunited before 
le chambonsurlignon was like paradise a little corner of 
the world that allowed us to survive said joseph atlas 14 when 
he reached le chambon after a brief period at an internment camp 
atlas now a 64yearold engineer said residents might not 
understand why many jews took so long returning to the village to 
express thanks 
at the end of the war when we discovered the full extent of 
the holocaust we had to rebuild ourselves psychologically he 
said 
atlas praised the films accuracy but said it brought back 
troubling memories 
the film is the work of pierre sauvage born in 1944 to jews who 
took refuge in le chambon 
sauvage says le chambon inspired by its impassioned pastor 
andre trocme was swept up in a conspiracy of goodness 
goodness was contagious it was a situation in which it was 
almost harder to do evil than good said sauvage who is based in 
los angeles and has worked for pbs in the united states 
the villagers are hardly inclined to see themselves as heroes 
they simply thought what they did was normal and they looked 
at me as though my questions were stupid sauvage said 
madga trocme 89 widow of pastor trocme said the villagers 
acted because they knew in their hearts anything else would have 
been a sin 
they acted in the memory of their huguenot tradition and the 
persecution they experienced over the centuries she said after 
seing the film it was war everybody was in danger we did what 
we did because it had to be done

a chilean arms maker on monday denied 
published reports that it is negotiating the sale of a new airfuel 
bomb to iraq through the libyan government of col moammar ghadafi 
cardoen industries said in a communique it has never made such a

president bush signed a bill monday authorizing 
payments of up to 100000 for people who may have developed cancer 
from nuclear testing or uranium mining in western states during the 
cold war 
these payments fairly resolve the claims of persons present at 
the test site and of downwind residents as well as claims of 
uranium miners bush said in a statement he signed the measure 
during a campaign trip here 
the united states conducted more than 200 atomic tests in the 
open air in both the south pacific and in nevada 
atmospheric testing of atomic devices important to national 
security during the darkest days of the cold war ended in 1963 
when the united states signed and ratified the limited test ban 
treaty bush said 
the bill authorizes 100 million for a radiation exposure trust 
fund money for the fund would have to be appropriated in a 
separate bill 
the bill provides compensation for people who developed cancer 
in certain time periods and 
spent one or two years depending on their type of cancer in 
downwind areas of nevada arizona or utah from nuclear tests 
between 1951 and 1958 or between june and july 1962 
or mined uranium in colorado new mexico arizona wyoming or 
utah from 1947 to 1971 
uranium miners are entitled to payments of 100000 persons 
exposed to radiation and who contracted specific diseases would be 
entitled to 50000 
courts have ruled the government was immune from prosecution 
because national security dictated a need for the uranium but 
judges involved in the case urged the miners to seek redress from 
congress 
rep wayne owens dutah an attorney who represented the 
downwinders in a federal lawsuit eight years ago said the bill 
will benefit people he called great patriots 
they are victims of the cold war and they will now be 
compensated for their long suffering he said 
sen orrin hatch rutah who cosponsored the bill with owens 
said the formal apology contained in the measure might mean more to 
victims than the money 
people were sick of what went on and how callous the federal 
government seemed to be hatch said the apology should make 
people feel pretty doggone good 
one who agreed was rula orton of parowan utah her 14yearold 
daughter died in 1960 of leukemia that doctors think may have been 
induced by radiation im glad theyre owning up to it said 
orton i feel very good about that

recent rises in oil prices stem 
solely from fears of a war not a supply shortage kuwaits oil 
minister said monday analysts said saudi arabia whose reserves 
have risen dramatically in the past year will probably help 
prevent severe price shocks during a war 
the oil minister for the exiled kuwaiti government rashid 
alameeri said at a news conference that oil prices would increase 
in the event of hostilities but he said they would not skyrocket 
to 100 a barrel as predicted recently by a former saudi oil 
minister ahmeed zaki yamani 
ameeri spoke in the saudi capital where his governmentinexile 
has been established since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
a usled multinational force has been deployed to saudi arabia 
in response to the iraqi aggression and the standoff is entering 
its 11th week 
a trade embargo meant to force iraq out of kuwait has cut off 
four million barrels per day of oil exports from iraq and occupied 
kuwait 
industry experts noted saudi arabia which sits on a third of 
the worlds proven oil reserves would exert itself to stabilize 
the market the saudis already have been instrumental in offsetting 
the shortfall in the oil market resulting from the invasion of 
kuwait 
the kingdom increased its own output by about two million 
barrels per day to 75 million barrels and convinced other members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries cartel to 
increase their output 
in addition saudi oil officials refer to the four strikes made 
between june 1989 and april 1990 in a previously untapped central 
region of the kingdom during that period official estimates of 
the kingdoms proven reserves jumped by about 50 percent to 252 
billion barrels 
light sweet crude was trading at 3775 per barrel monday on the 
new york mercantile exchange oil was selling on international 
markets for about 21 a barrel in july 
ameeri said the recent increase in oil prices was not the result 
of any shortage in oil supplies but stemmed from fears about a war 
in the gulf 
his statements were clearly intended as reassurance independent 
oil industry executives said that the market would suffer a severe 
upheaval in the event of a middle east war but that the extent to 
which oil prices will rise would depend on the extent of damages to 
the regional oil facilities and the duration of hostilities 
saudi oil officials led by the minister hisham nazer often 
play up the countrys oil production potential 
oil experts note the kingdom is also putting back into service 
old facilities that were mothballed during the oil glut in the 
early 1980s 
ameeri said iraqi troops have placed mines around kuwaiti oil 
fields refineries and other installations the iraqis have also 
stolen equipment from kuwaiti oil facilities he said 
the damage to the oil industry in kuwait is huge ameeri 
said 
he estimated the iraqis are now pumping about 90000 barrels a 
day just meeting the needs of local power stations and 
desalination plants kuwaits preinvasion output was 15 million 
barrels a day 
iraqs invasion followed iraqi president saddam husseins claims 
that kuwait had cost iraq 14 billion in lost oil revenue by 
overproducing and driving down prices and that it had stolen 24 
billion of oil from the rumailah field between the two countries

state officials must get federal approval 
before holding elections for dozens of state judges the supreme 
court ruled in a georgia case monday 
the justices unanimously upheld a threejudge federal courts 
ruling that such approval is required by the voting rights act of 
1965 
the decision announced without first hearing arguments in the 
case was the first in which newly installed justice david h 
souter participated 
it came on an appeal by georgia officials and a crossappeal by 
black voters who wanted new elections ordered for judgeships 
already filled 
at issue was the scope of the 1965 laws requirement that 
officials in southern states and elsewhere get justice department 
approval before making changes in election systems 
from 1964 to 1988 georgia created 77 new trial judges and five 
new judicial circuits 
attorney general dick thornburgh in 1989 said he opposed 48 of 
the judgeships and the redistricting plans for two circuits 
the georgia general assembly also voted last year to create six 
more judgeships the state had not submitted those to thornburgh 
for his approval when a special threejudge federal court last year 
ruled the state violated the voting rights act 
the federal court said the state must get approval from the 
attorney general for any election changes that could discriminate 
against blacks 
the creation of new judgeships does have the potential for 
discrimination the panel said because georgia has rules that 
blunt minorities voting power in electing judges 
those rules authorize circuitwide voting and require candidates 
to designate the specific opening they are seeking if a judicial 
circuit has more than one judgeship vacancy 
the threejudge court ordered georgia officials to comply with 
the voting rights act requirement of federal approval or keep the 
judgeships unfilled 
but the federal court refused to overturn the results of any 
previous elections because the remaining judges would be 
overwhelmed by the resulting increase in work and the court system 
thrown into disarray 
georgia officials said there is no evidence blacks have suffered 
from discrimination they said there are many black judges in the 
state though less than the percentage of black citizens

a judge predicted a long and convoluted 
proceeding monday in the fraud case against the arizona developer 
who formerly headed american continental corp 
charles keating is accused of bilking investors with american 
continental junk bonds sold through the nowdefunct irvinebased 
lincoln savings and loan lincolns failure was the nations most 
expensive savings and loan collapse 
keating 66 remained jailed monday in lieu of 5 million bail 
but he made his first comment on the case as he was being led into 
the downtown criminal courts building through an underground 
garage 
its dangerous to be right when government is wrong keating 
told reporters 
his lawyer stephen neal asked to explain keatings comment 
would say only mr keating is innocent he believes in his 
innocence hes confident that when the evidence is developed he 
will be vindicated 
keating was chairman of phoenixbased american continental 
which owned lincoln experts estimate the cost of bailing out 
lincoln will reach 2 billion 
prosecutors say investors in american continental junk bonds 
lost more than 250 million 
superior court judge lance ito said he would read the 45volume 
transcript of grand jury proceedings before oct 26 when he set a 
hearing for legal arguments on defense motions seeking to have the 
judge throw out the indictment as insufficient 
the judge said he would also decide at that hearing whether to 
keep the grand jury transcripts sealed and would rule on defense 
motions for discovery of prosecution evidence 
a prosecutor deputy district attorney william hodgman said he 
would ask for reciprocal discovery of defense evidence 
i expect this will be a long and convoluted discovery 
proceeding the judge commented 
ito set a tentative trial date of nov 26 but conceded that 
would probably be delayed 
neal said a spring date would be more realistic and the judge 
said im not overly optimistic on the trial date 
neal said he was still pursuing a bail reduction for keating in 
federal court after losing similar bids in state appeals courts 
also in court for mondays hearing were keatings codefendants 
who are all free on bail they are ray c fidel 32 former 
president of lincoln robin s symes 37 who was its chief 
executive officer and judy wischer 42 who was president of 
american continental 
each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of

chancellor helmut kohl on monday appealed 
to people who left east germany to return home and help repair that 
part of the new united germany 
his remark came as kohl hailed his partys sunday election 
victories in nowdefunct east germany where his christian 
democrats won the most votes in four out of five states 
the victories strengthened kohls already good chances of 
winning united germanys first national parliamentary vote seven 
weeks from now 
he told reporters steps should be taken to encourage those who 
left the ddr east germany whenever and for whatever reason to 
return 
he said that would be a very important contribution to 
rebuilding former east germany which is beset by skyrocketing 
unemployment and other formidable problems 
more than 46 million east germans fled to west germany during 
40 years of communist rule in the east 
earlier in the day kohl met other leaders of the christian 
democratic union to discuss sundays election victories 
the 14th of october is a day of great joy and satisfaction 
kohl said 
he said the party has a favorable starting position for 
federal elections on dec 2 in which underdog social democratic 
candidate oskar lafontaine will try to unseat kohl 
the social democrats were clearly stung by the results 
it doesnt appear as if were headed into any shining or 
glorious victory but it is still not the reason to give up 
reinhard klimmt lafontaines campaign manager said 
the chancellor warned his party against complacency 
there is the danger that some might believe the election is 
already over there can be no talk of this he said 
opinion polls taken before sundays balloting already indicated 
kohl had a healthy lead over lafontaine 
the christian democrats won the most votes in the newly created 
states of saxony thuringia saxonyanhalt and mecklenburglower 
pomerania 
brandenburg was the only eastern state where the social 
democrats won against the conservatives final results there gave 
the social democrats 382 percent of the vote to 294 percent for 
the christian democrats 
the christian democrats won an absolute majority in saxony with 
538 percent of the vote and will be looking for coalition 
partners in three other states 
the most likely partner are the free democrats already the 
junior member of kohls governing coalition 
christian democrat alfred gomulka who won the vote for governor 
in mecklenburglower pomerania said he may try to forge a grand 
coalition to include the social democrats the christian 
demorats and free democrats combined vote there falls short of a 
parliamentary majority 
the party for democratic socialism comprising east germanys 
former communists drew less voter support than in east germanys 
first free elections in march the party still won seats in each 
state legislature and is the thirdstrongest party in some areas 
its best showings were in mecklenburglower pomerania 156 
percent and brandenburg 134 percent 
the farright republicans were shut out of all five state 
legislatures 
the best they did was 115 percent in brandenburg parties had 
to win at least 5 percent of the vote to win state legislative 
seats 
the turnout in the five states that used to be east germany 
ranged from 65 to 735 percent of the 115 million eligible voters 
the dec 2 vote will install the first democratically elected 
leader for all of germany in nearly 60 years 
kurt von schleicher the last leader of the weimar republic was 
chosen chancellor after elections in november 1932 
in january 1933 nazi dictator adolf hitler took over through 
political maneuvering amid a collapsing political and economic 
system 
kohl expressed concern on monday that former communist 
functionaries may still be exerting influence in eastern germany 
he said a major challenge for eastern germany is dismantling old 
structures left over from communism

floridas mosquitocarried encephalitis 
outbreak has recorded its first confirmed fatality and health 
officials warned monday that trickortreaters should not go out 
after dark on halloween 
the victim was a 58yearold west melbourne woman who fell into 
a coma two months ago she died saturday one day after her 
respirator was disconnected 
the viral illness is carried by a mosquito that feeds around 
dusk 
thirtyfour people in 15 counties across central and south 
florida have contracted the socalled st louis strain of 
encephalitis since midaugust fifteen became so ill they required 
hospitalization and two people slipped into comas twentyone more 
people have shown positive results on the first of two tests needed 
for confirmation 
dr charles s mahan the state health officer called on all 
florida communities to hold halloween activities during the 
afternoon instead of the evening as is traditional in order to 
reduce the risk of exposure 
moving the trickortreat hours is a prudent precaution in 
light of the current increase in the number of st louis 
encephalitis cases mahan said in a statement 
authorities were looking at a possible second encephalitis death 
in st lucie county last month but are awaiting test results 
symptoms of the disease can range from headaches and fevers 
usually associated with the flu to coma and death resulting from 
brain inflammation in between people can experience a stiff neck 
tiredness and irritability other severe symptoms include extreme 
sleepiness tremors and seizures 
the death rate from st louis encephalitis typically is 7 
percent eight people died during the last florida outbreak of st 
louis encephalitis in 1977 the state usually has one to three 
cases a year according to ernie durfee a spokesman for the state 
department of health and rehabilitative services 
floridas first confirmed fatality was alvena patton who had 
been in a coma since aug 21 durfee said 
her husband said his family hopes her death will cause officials 
and residents to take warnings more seriously 
the county needs to get serious about this virus said harry 
patton they need to get spray trucks out and try to stop this 
thing i know it costs a lot of money but peoples lives are at 
stake 
mahan said that although mosquito eradication efforts have been 
increased the recent increase in rainfall could prolong the 
current mosquito infestation until drier colder weather arrives

us airlines faced with a 10 billion boost 
in the cost of jet fuel because of the persian gulf crisis will 
incur a 1 billion loss in the final quarter of 1990 the president 
of the air transport association said monday 
the airline industry has never lost that much in an entire 
year robert j aaronson the associations president said in a 
speech prepared for delivery in montreal 
the industry had profits of 170 million on total revenues of 
28 billion in the first six months of the year the ata said 
thirdquarter figures were not yet available 
the airline spokesman called for intervention to stop rampant 
speculation in petroleum products on the commodities markets and 
said rising prices do not reflect the fact that adequate petroleum 
supplies are available on world markets 
soaring fuel prices which have now risen by more than 100 
percent thrust the airline industry into a crisis the likes of 
which it has never seen aaronson said 
the effects of almost daily rises in jet fuel costs on top of 
a softening economy can only exacerbate the weakened financial 
condition of the airlines and lead to widescale layoffs and 
service reductions throughout the industry he said 
the airlines have already laid off 10000 employees and delayed 
delivery of scores of new jets aaronson said 
the highly competitive nature of the airlines makes it virtually 
impossible to cover all costs simply by raising prices aaronson 
said 
according to aviation daily the average price per gallon paid 
for jet fuel on the spot market on friday was 142 up from 57 
cents a gallon in the days immediately before iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
aaronson the airlines spokesman urged the commodities markets 
to limit the volatility of speculative trading in oil 
the market does not reflect the reality of the supply 
situation and it is incumbent on the commodities markets to limit 
this rampant speculation he said 
speculators are amassing fortunes at the expense of ordinary 
citizens and businesses he said 
aaronson also called on the bush administration to reconsider 
billions of dollars in new taxes on the air travel industry that 
have been proposed during current budget negotiations 
no industry or sector of the economy has been hit as hard as 
the airline industry during this fuel crisis he said now is 
the worst possible time to put additional tax burdens on an 
industry already faced with costs beyond its control an industry 
that is scrambling for economic survival

president elias hrawi started dismantling 
beiruts dividing green line on monday to unify what he hopes will 
be a militiafree capital after the defeat of rebel gen michel 
aoun 
government bulldozers removed mounds of earth rocks and other 
obstacles from the galerie semaan crossing on the highway linking 
moslem south beirut with the christian suburbs of hazmiyeh and 
baabda 
motorists then drove across the intersection waving their hands 
to helmeted lebanese soldiers and honking their horns in 
jubilation 
lebanese and syrian army engineering units removed mines from 
the intersection saturday when syrian and lebanese troops advanced 
behind a curtain of heavy air and artillery shelling to end aouns 
rebellion 
syrian and lebanese troops crushed aouns 11month mutiny in an 
eighthour assault saturday that killed 160 and wounded 800 
aoun remained in refuge in the french embassy for the third day 
monday with lebanon insisting that he face trial on a variety of 
charges including the theft of state funds 
in paris french president francois mitterrand said he would 
reject any lebanese request to hand aoun over scores of his 
supporters occupied lebanons embassy in paris and its consulate in 
marseille demanding aouns safe passage to france 
aoun began his mutiny in november 1989 after rejecting an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
and calling hrawi a syrian puppet the peace plan provides for the 
traditionally dominant christians to share power with the moslem 
majority 
syrian forces arrested six of aouns top lieutenants including 
his chief of military intelligence col amer chehab they were 
interrogating them at the lebanese defense ministry which was 
seized from aouns troops 
the galerie semaan crossing was flooded with cars less than 30 
minutes after the army command of gen emile lahoud declared it 
safe for civilian traffic 
lebanese army engineering units were removing mines from areas 
along beiruts fivemile green line in preparation for dismantling 
it 
the green line which has divided beirut into moslem and 
christian sectors since the outbreak of the civil war was torn 
down in the early days of former president amin gemayels term in 
office in september 1982 
however moslem and leftist gunmen regained their positions 
along the line when they ousted gemayels christianled army from 
beiruts moslem sector in a bloody confrontation in february 1984 
the green line is expected to be totally dismantled in a week 
or so said the police spokesman speaking anonymously in line 
with regulations 
dismantling the green line would be the first step toward the 
creation of a militiafree greater beirut extending 22 miles 
along the mediterranean coast and covering the capitals nearby 
suburbs at the foothills of the central mountains 
bringing down the green line would be one more major dividing 
line to fall the past year the berlin wall built in 1961 by east 
germany as an ideological division to the west was torn apart last 
fall during a popular uprising 
the major obstacles are the presence of christian shiite and 
druse militias in that territory 
hrawi met monday with a sixofficer delegation from the syrian 
military command and discussed with them among other topics the 
greater beirut plan a presidential statement said it did not 
disclose further details 
the syrian team included maj gen saeed bayrakdar commander of 
syrias 40000 troops in lebanon and brig gen ghazi kenaan 
chief of syrias military intelligence in the country 
syria in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate considers 
the country its strategic backyard the fall of aoun has 
strengthened its hold on the country 
hrawi instructed a twoman government committee to start 
discussions with the various militias to arrange for their 
withdrawal from the greater beirut a government source said 
the army ordered a battalion of its military police to enforce 
law and order in the 80squaremile enclave formerly controlled by 
aoun 
police said leftist and moslem militias moved into some 
christian villages after aouns troops collapsed to settle old 
scores with traditional civil war foes 
a police spokesman said shiite moslem gunmen of the proiranian 
hezbollah advanced to beiruts christian suburb of hadath on sunday 
and were involved in kidnapping christians and looting houses 
a prosyrian christian militia led by elie hobeika also entered 
hadath and clashed briefly with hezbollah late sunday over 
looting four people were killed and 10 wounded 
leftist militiamen of the syrian social nationalist party 
traditional enemies of lebanons rightwing christians slipped 
into the mountain resort of bekfaya northeast of beirut stormed 
phalange party offices and kidnapped a number of phalangists the 
police spokesman said 
the phalange party the largest rightwing christian political 
group was opposed to aouns mutiny

the bush administration reacted monday with 
mild displeasure to an israeli government decision not to cooperate 
with a united nations team investigating the shooting deaths of 19 
palestinian arabs 
we want to see that un resolution fully implemented 
president bush said as he flew to texas and nebraska to raise funds 
and make speeches for republican candidates 
we were a part of it and we think its the right step so ill 
just leave it there bush told reporters who traveled with him on 
air force one the presidential jet 
the state department going a step further in criticizing the 
israeli cabinets decision said through spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler the united states voted for this resolution because we 
think it is right and therefore we are disappointed that the 
israeli government has decided not to cooperate with the mission 
the us official added in fact we think that failure to 
cooperate denies israel an opportunity to present its case to the 
secretarygeneral we are hopeful that the secretarygenerals 
people will be able to carry out this mission 
secretary of state james a baker iii in a message to foreign 
minister david levy before the vote made clear our sense of 
concern over israels handling of the situation ms tutwiler 
said later 
the 19 palestinians were killed by israeli police on the 
hallowed temple mount sacred to moslems and jews last monday the 
shootings were the climax to a riot that began when palestinians 
threw rocks onto jewish worshipers praying below at the western 
wall a sacred site to jews police first used tear gas and rubber 
bullets then live ammunition 
the united states drafted a resolution for the security council 
to condemn the israeli police while also regretting interference 
with worship the palestine liberation organization through yemen 
proposed censuring israel and establishing un oversight of 
israels treatment of palestinians 
finally the council last friday night adopted a modified 
version of the us draft authorizing secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar to send investigators to jerusalem but without 
calling for permanent un involvement 
israels cabinet on sunday issued a communique calling the 
resolution completely unacceptable it said israel would not 
receive the delegation 
state department spokeswoman tutwiler confirming reports in the 
israeli press said baker had interceded with levy before the vote 
in a message through the us embassy in tel aviv he told levy 
that admitting the un mission would not have set a precedent 
since israel had accepted a representative of perez de cuellar in 
june the us official said 
we would like to see this issue concluded and hope that israel 
will find a way to work with the secretarygenerals 
representative ms tutwiler said in a statement 
israeli reports said baker wrote levy he was worried that 
rejection would focus world attention on israel instead of iraq 
whose annexation of kuwait the united states is trying to reverse 
according to the newspaper yediot ahronot baker told levy at 
a time when i am sure that you would have preferred that there 
would not have been any security council decision at all we 
exerted every effort including threats of a veto against the much 
harsher proposal that had been approved 
we supported this decision that we felt that israel should 
have been prepared and capable of dealing with the violence and 
rioting without killing 20 people or injuring 150 in the fact that 
they were not prepared israel played into the hands of iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
i am worried that if you reject this mission that is about to 
travel to israel you will put israel and not iraq at the center 
of world attention 
baker also told levy the united states would ask the security 
council to reconvene to reach a new decision on iraqs 
aggression against kuwait we will not allow saddam hussein to 
get off the hook the letter said 
spokeswoman tutwiler did not confirm the authenticity of the 
letter or release a text here she said she had to consult baker 
the administration has taken the position it was not connecting 
iraqs invasion of kuwait with the dispute between israel and 
palestinians 
saddam hussein has called for considering the two issues 
simultaneously bush in a speech to the un general assembly two 
weeks ago said an iraqi withdrawal could lead to opportunities to 
resolve the israelipalestinian issue

instead of gunfire and explosions along 
beiruts green line there were sounds of hope monday as a 
bulldozer toppled a section of the fivemile border dividing the 
christian and moslem sides 
soon the battleravaged passage was filled with motorists 
honking car horns in celebration 
the first steps in dismantling the 15yearold barrier came 
after syrian and government troops crushed rebel christian gen 
michel aouns 11month mutiny against president elias hrawi on 
saturday 
aoun opposed an arab league peace plan that hrawi was elected 
last november to implement with hrawis forces in control of 
christian east beirut a cautious reunification effort was begun 
according to plans in the alwaysvolatile lebanese capital 
unrestricted access between east beirut and the moslem western 
district may be possible next week 
the green line a zone of earthen mounds barbed wire 
sandbags overturned buses and other debris has stood as a symbol 
to lebanons civil war since it was first set up in april 1975 
unlike the berlin wall that was erected for ideological reasons 
in 1961 to separate east from west and fell during a popular 
uprising last year the green line took shape gradually and along 
religious lines as the battles intensified 
it took its name from a similar zone erected in 1974 on the 
eastern mediterranean island of cyprus to divide greek and 
turkishcontrolled areas 
the green line was partially dismantled in 1983 under former 
president amin gemayels administration with the help of a 
multinational peacekeeping force 
but it was refortified in february 1984 when moslem militia 
drove gemayels christian army units out of the moslem sector 
beginning years of killings kidnappings and violence 
the green line is now dotted with bushes and undergrowth that 
have sprouted amid the ruins in a city once called the paris of the 
middle east 
tree stumps unrooted from parks stand in longvacated highways 
amid twisted traffic lights and rusted road signs many roads and 
alleys are littered with live shells and grenades 
the line curves from the warbattered port district through the 
ruins of the oncebustling downtown commercial district to the 
foothills of the central mountains overlooking the city 
the hundreds of highrise apartment blocks on either side of the 
line are riddled with bullet holes and scorch marks from exploding 
shells 
these were the sniper nests where militiamen from both sides 
clashed almost daily killing hundreds of people many of victims 
were women hanging their washing or civilians trapped in the open 
when the gun battles flared without warning 
despite the encouraging signs monday hrawi still faces a 
struggle in a country plagued by deep hostilities 
there are still christian and moslem militia positions on the 
line but commanders pledge these will gradually be abandoned

a ring of security guards around the parliament building to hold 
the sitin

ukrainian student movement interfax and postfactum are independent 
agencies established the past two years that distribute information 
primarily by fax 
student leaders could not be reached by telephone monday night 
for independent confirmation 
several dozen students set up a tent camp and began the hunger 
strike in kiev two weeks ago seven opposition members of 
parliament joined the hunger strike five days ago and an unknown 
number of additional hunger strikers have since set up solidarity 
camps in five other ukrainian cities according to interfax

start a dialogue with the students postfactum said

communist party property refuse to sign a new union treaty with 
the other soviet republics require ukrainians drafted into the red 
army to serve within the republics borders dissolve the 
republics parliament and call new elections

the justice department on monday urged 
adoption of sentencing guidelines for corporations convicted of 
crimes that would force judges to impose fines based on the 
seriousness of the offense 
but the department shied away from a proposal it had earlier 
advanced under which a company involved in a massive fraud could be 
fined twice its gain or twice the loss to its victims 
the department had endorsed this proposal last february when the 
us sentencing commission was debating two different proposals 
for corporate sentencing guidelines 
the department rescinded its support for one of the proposals 
under consideration as well as its own suggestion after receiving 
an inquiry from the white house which had been contacted by 
business groups expressing concern over stiff fines 
the letter by thendeputy attorney general donald b ayer 
endorsing the proposal had been sent without the permission of 
attorney general dick thornburgh the department said 
since that dispute which contributed to ayers resignation on 
may 11 the justice department has reviewed its position it 
reiterated its support monday for a proposal that sets fines 
according to the severity of the offense 
the commission was set up under a 1984 law designed to eliminate 
disparity in sentences it has already promulgated complicated 
guidelines for punishing individuals according to the type of 
offense and the defendants criminal history but last winter the 
commission put off adopting guidelines for sentencing corporations 
convicted of crimes 
the system we are advocating will result in stiff corporate 
sanctions deputy assistant attorney general paul l maloney told 
reporters 
we support a system of imposing fines that captures the 
seriousness of the offense as measured by the commissions existing 
ranking of offenses in the guidelines for individuals thornburgh 
said in a letter to the commission that was released by the 
department 
we believe that an offenselevel approach rather than an 
approach based on gain or loss accomplishes this purpose 
thornburgh said 
the seriousness of the offense and therefore the size of the 
fine would be determined by a number of factors including whether 
top officials were involved in the crime or whether the company had 
a history of similar misconduct 
bribery or threats to national security also could lead to 
higher fines the department said 
under the proposal outlined by the justice department companies 
that report wrongdoing as soon as it is discovered and cooperate 
with prosecutors would be credited with lower fines 
corporate lawyer victoria toensing a former senior justice 
department official who had argued against adoption of earlier 
proposals praised the departments letter as offering a sensible 
approach for punishing corporate misbehavior 
the justice departments proposal would help courts distinguish 
between responsible corporations that are prosecuted for the 
actions of rogue employees and those whose management flagantly 
flout the law she said 
the department essentially endorses the same proposal it had 
supported earlier this year but thornburghs letter said the 
department no longer supports a provision it had advanced to fine 
companies the greater amount of tiwce its gain or the loss to 
victims 
maloney said deparment reviewed comments filed with the 
sentencing commission in deciding on its new position the white 
house approved the letter that thornburgh sent the sentencing 
commission but did not participate in the departments decisions 
maloney said

a man already facing the death penalty 
in nebraska for killing two boys there was found guilty of murder 
monday in the stabbing and strangling of an 11yearold boy more 
than eight years ago in portland 
john j joubert 27 originally from portland was found guilty 
in the august 1982 killing of richard stetson 
joubert sat expressionless and blinked as the jurys verdict was 
read after less than two hours of deliberations no sentencing date 
was set 
joubert already is scheduled to be executed in nebraskas 
electric chair on dec 7 for murdering two boys age 12 and 13 
there in 1983 he had been an airman stationed at offutt air force 
base outside omaha when those crimes took place 
prosecutors had said joubert would be returned to nebraska to 
face the sentence there no matter what happened at his trial in 
maine 
his lawyer liisa hamilton said she expects him to appeal the 
maine verdict and will seek to withdraw his guilty pleas in the 
nebraska murders 
assistant attorney general eric wright who prosecuted joubert 
in maine said he would seek maines maximum life prison sentence 
for joubert wright also explained why maine sought to try a man 
already on death row in another state 
i think people in this state need to understand that we wanted 
to do our best to make sure that if he ever got out from under his 
death sentence in nebraska hed have no place to go but thomaston 
to die said wright referring to a state prison 
jouberts reaction to the verdict was no comment 
before the jurors began deliberations they were challenged by 
both the defense and the prosecution to carefully compare casts of 
jouberts teeth to photos of bite marks on the victims leg 
wright said the casts match the tooth marks hamilton said they 
dont necessarily match and said she was unconvinced the marks on 
stetsons body were left by teeth 
but the marks proved pivotal in the jurys final decision as 
did testimony from a journalist who interviewed joubert after the 
killing said forewoman terry blazek of waldoboro 
blazek said jurors were unaware of jouberts nebraska 
convictions 
every single one of us had no idea about what happened in the 
other states she said 
because of pretrial publicity jouberts trial was moved from 
portland to wiscasset a small coastal town about 30 miles to the 
north 
prosecutors relied heavily on testimony from a journalist who 
wrote a book about joubert and claimed that during an interview 
about his crimes joubert did not deny he killed stetson 
in his final address to the jury wright took issue with the 
defense attorneys attempts to link an alternative suspect to the 
crime saying that there was no evidence to support that 
wright also labeled as unreliable the testimony of dr 
norman d sperber a forensic dentist called by the defense who 
said it was unlikely jouberts teeth left the marks the prosecutor 
said sperbers testimony was riddled with inconsistencies and 
contradictions 
hamilton attacked the testimony of mark pettit a television 
journalist who has interviewed joubert for a book he wrote about 
the defendant and his crimes 
pettit testified that when he asked joubert if he killed 
stetson joubert responded i cant lie to you i cant tell you 
i didnt do it 
hamilton questioned why pettit failed to go to the police with 
that information 
why would he make that statement to a reporter of all 
people said hamilton

hundreds of prominent kuwaiti exiles 
vowed monday at the conclusion of a threeday conference to return 
home with the alsabah rulers and liberate kuwait from the iraqi 
occupying forces 
they insisted in a communique there will be no bargaining and 
no negotiating on kuwaits sovereignty independence and 
territorial security 
conference sources said it was tantamount to a message to iraqi 
president saddam hussein rejecting any settlement that falls short 
of a total pullout of iraqi troops that invaded kuwait on aug 2 
reports from moscow said saddam might withdraw in return for 
some kuwaiti territory along the persian gulf and in tunis yasser 
arafat chief of the palestine liberation organization said saddam 
was showing a certain flexibility regarding the occupation 
iraq invaded its oilrich neighbor after a dispute over the 
kuwaiti islands of warba and bubiyan which would provide iraq with 
an outlet on the gulf saddam also claimed kuwait was stealing oil 
from the rumailah oilfield that crosses 2 miles into kuwaiti 
territory nearly all the oilfield is in iraq 
conference sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
saddam appeared to be contemplating a partial withdrawal that would 
let him keep bubiyan warba and the rumailah oilfield 
about 750 kuwaiti business executives economists and 
politicians attended the conference which focused on their 
countrys plight and its future they urged the un security 
council to pursue all available means to ensure an iraqi 
withdrawal and enable its former rulers to return 
oil minister rashid alameeri told reporters iraqi troops have 
placed mines around kuwaiti oil fields refineries and other 
installations the iraqis also have stolen equipment from kuwaiti 
oil facilities he said 
the damage to the oil industry in kuwait is huge ameeri 
said almost everything is damaged 
the conference was called in large part as a manifestation of 
solidarity between the people and the exiled leadership 
with prominent opposition ranks represented it was also meant 
to show saddam his call for replacing the alsabah leadership 
through a referendum would run into a stone wall 
the crown prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah 
alsabah presided 
he told iraqs leaders in his closing address you have no 
place in kuwait and you will have to leave it through peace or war 
if need be 
saad assured the estimated 300000 citizens in occupied kuwait 
you are not alone in your struggle against the tyranny of the 
iraqi regime 
originally 800000 citizens were in kuwait 
the communique declared our condemnation and detestation of 
all oppression murder torture looting and terrorism committed by 
the forces of the iraqi regime against unarmed and innocent 
civilians in kuwait 
we declare our solidarity with our legitimate leadership 
in the persons of our emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and his 
crown prince 
fatima hussein wife of kuwaiti planning minister suleiman 
abdulrazzak almuttawa told a news conference iraq is fencing off 
northern kuwait territory saddam has long coveted 
the iraqis apparently plan to gulp up bubiyan and the 
northeastern oilfield said mrs hussein who fled kuwait last 
week 
she said the fence extended from the northeastern matla area 
with one third of the kuwait territory north of the fence abutting 
iraqs basra region 
she said this area includes warba and bubiyan and the part of 
the ratqa oil field that extends into iraq under the name of 
rumailah only about 5 percent of the oilfield is in kuwait 
she said occupation forces were marking empty houses for iraqi 
occupation and three huge statues of saddam were being erected in 
kuwait city 
the communique asked arab powers that had been sympathetic with 
iraq to reconsider and also said kuwait still supports the 
palestinian struggle to regain their homeland and rights from 
israel despite the position taken by palestinian leaders against 
kuwait 
it said kuwait bears no grudges against the people of iraq 
we know for certain they are helpless and await the hour 
of salvation when the tyrant of baghdad and his clique fall 
the conference was meant also to map postliberation reform 
blueprints that call for a democratic system of rule based on free 
elections 
the communique stated in general that the people of kuwait 
stick to their national unity and legitimate system of government 
which is based on consultation democracy and participation in 
government in the shadow of the 1962 constitution 
there was no sign whether opposition ranks received assurances 
they sought beyond good intent 
the conference opened saturday with an ovation for the emir and 
his crown prince when he promised more westernstyle democracy

level would face a 74 percent tax increase 
for people between those extremes the legislation would result 
in tax increases in the 1 percent range that would result from 
putting higher consumer taxes on alcohol and tobacco giving up 
next years income tax adjustment to offset inflation and raising 
the amount of wages subject to the medicare tax 
economists for the house ways and means committee which wrote 
the proposal estimated its tax changes and cost increases for 
medicare beneficiaries would cost the average family 352 next 
year 
analysts said 
the poorest onefifth of families with aftertax income 
averaging 7316 would get a 14 tax cut 
the secondpoorest onefifth averaging 16917 would pay 114 
more 
the middle group averaging 25896 would pay 183 more 
the secondrichest 20 percent averaging 36481 would face a 
280 tax increase 
the top 20 percent whose incomes average 81934 would pay 
1173 more 
those with incomes averaging over 428000 the richest 1 
percent would face a 13951 tax increase 
although other deficit plans are being considered the house 
democratic version is getting most of the attention now because of 
the administrations opposition and because it seems to have 
support from most of the partys house members 
president bush after meeting with the congressional republican 
leaders sen bob dole of kansas and rep bob michel of illinois 
said monday that they were pretty much on the same wavelength 
in preferring a different tax increase approved by the senate 
finance committee what ill do is say the actions in the 
congress and i will take a look at what comes out bush told 
reporters on a campaign trip to texas 
house republican leaders after days of indecision and disputes 
among the rank and file decided monday to advance a budget plan of 
their own with broad spending cuts and no dramatic tax increases 
the only new levies would be some of the increases bush proposed 
in his budget last january in a bow to the partys conservative 
wing the gop plan would not increase taxes on the wealthiest 
americans but neither would it cut the capital gains tax a 
longtime goal of the president 
unlike the house democrats plan the finance committee version 
would avoid changes in income tax rates but would limit itemized 
deductions for people earning over 100000 
the finance panels plan would raise taxes by just under 3 
percent for families in the 20000to50000 income range 19 
percent for those between 50000 and 75000 and 35 percent for 
those between 100000 and 200000 the 200000plus group would 
pay 37 percent more 
because differences between the house democrats tax plan and 
the senate finance committee version will take some time to 
resolve it becomes more likely that bush will order the government 
shut down saturday morning for the second time this month 
more than two weeks into the new budget year congress has yet 
to enact the first of 13 required appropriation bills a stopgap 
spending measure expires at midnight friday and bush has said he 
will not agree to another unless congress has approved a 
deficitreduction plan that the administration supports 
house liberals say their bill would reverse a 1980s trend that 
saw higherincome americans take an increasing share of the 
national wealth they note a congressional budget office conclusion 
that the richest 5 percent of americans saw their aftertax income 
rise by 54 percent between 1980 and 1990 while all other groups 
lost ground 
the democratic plan would raise taxes by 1486 billion over the 
next five years and require those with incomes above 50000 to pay 
about twothirds of that increase 
it would raise from 28 percent to 33 percent the top income tax 
rate paid by those with highest incomes and require those earning 
over 1 million to pay an extra 10 percent tax a new 10 percent 
tax would be levied on part of the price of boats private planes 
furs cars and jewelry and the 51300 maximum annual wage on 
which the 145 percent medicare tax is paid would be raised to 
100000 
the liberal proposal dropped provisions in other plans that 
would raise the tax on gasoline and limit itemized deductions 
allowed people with incomes over 100000 a year keeping hands off 
the gas tax appeals to rural lawmakers while those from new york 
and california especially oppose limiting deductions 
to make up revenue that other plans would get from the gas tax 
liberals propose to forgo next years scheduled inflation 
adjustments in the tax brackets and personal exemptions 
that would mean higher taxes for everybody who files a return 
the least impact would be on those with the highest incomes who 
since they already would be paying the highest rate face no 
danger of being pushed by inflation into a higher tax bracket

nicaraguas consul in miami a nephew of president 
violeta chamorro on monday denied new reports linking him to 
cocaine trafficking as part of a gunsfordrugs scheme for the 
contras in the mid1980s 
adolfo popo chamorro said he knew nothing of a federal 
investigation growing out of testimony by a colombian drug pilot 
who said he paid the younger chamorro millions of dollars for drug 
shipments 
never in my life have i had anything to do with this type of 
illicit activity chamorro said he said neither mrs chamorros 
government nor the united states would have allowed him to take his 
highprofile post as nicaraguan consul in miami if he were under 
suspicion 
news reports about the case only help the sandinistas whose 
leftist government was fought by the contras and give arms to 
attack the new democratic government of nicaragua the newly 
appointed official said 
two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity have told the 
associated press that chamorro along with octaviano cesar 
brother of mrs chamorros top aide alfredo cesar are the 
subjects of an investigation by the customs service and other 
agencies 
chamorro 41 abruptly adjourned the news conference when asked 
if us authorities warned him that drug trafficker george morales 
was under indictment when the usbacked contras accepted cash and 
planes from him in 1984 
before walking out chamorro said both the united states and 
directors of the contra group he helped lead had authorized all 
transactions with morales and that he knew nothing about drug 
charges 
accusations linking chamorro with alleged gunsfordrugs 
deals are not new morales testified before a senate committee in 
1987 that chamorro and octaviano cesar arranged the trade of guns 
and drugs on a costa rican ranch owned by usborn contra 
supporter john hull 
morales said he was certain the cia and the us government 
authorized the deals in part because his drug indictment was 
ignored by the us attorneys office for two years while he helped 
the contras he was not taken into custody until a second 
indictment in 1986 and is now serving a 16year sentence 
chamorros exwife marta healey who married drug pilot richard 
healey after separating from chamorro reportedly knew morales and 
made the first connections between the trafficker and the contras 
that youll have to ask her i really dont know chamorro 
said monday when asked about his exwifes links to morales 
during the 1987 hearings chamorro and cesar acknowledged 
receiving help from morales and cesar said he suspected morales 
was involved with smuggling but both men denied any involvement 
with drugs 
at mondays news conference chamorro distributed a july 1988 
letter from the committees chairman us sen john kerry dmass 
saying the senate investigation had uncovered no evidence linking 
him to trafficking 
but kerrys spokesman michael meehan said monday that the letter 
was no longer valid 
there are three years and plenty of facts that have come 
forward since the hearings said meehan he mentioned the 
testimony of colombian drug pilot fabion ernesto carrasco in a 
tulsa okla case seven months ago 
carrasco testified he paid millions of dollars to chamorro and 
octaviano cesar for cocaine flown into florida by planes that in 
turn carried arms to central america 
carrascos attorney in miami john mattes refused to comment on 
the testimony except to say prosecutors and the tulsa jury had 
apparently found it credible 
carrasco testified he met chamorro octaviano cesar and morales 
at a miami restaurant in june 1984 to plan the gunsfordrugs 
arrangement he said he was the copilot on one subsequent flight 
and was ordered by morales to pay the other two men for the cocaine 
after successful drug flights 
in all a halfdozen flights each carrying 300 to 400 kilograms 
of cocaine were made from central america to the united states 
carrasco and morales said

us defense secretary dick cheney on monday said 
washington is prepared for a long haul in the gulf and 
americans are willing to keep troops deployed there for years 
at a news conference after talks with prime minister margaret 
thatcher cheney rejected the notion of a quick strike or any 
deadline for sanctions to force iraq from kuwait 
british defense secretary tom king also said his nation is 
prepared to keep forces in the gulf indefinitely 
cheney arrived in britain on sunday at the start of a 10day 
european tour to discuss the gulf crisis he goes to moscow on 
tuesday and then to paris 
no one should make the mistake of assuming this is the kind of 
operation which will be over in a very short period of time said 
cheney the united states is prepared for the long haul if that 
is what it takes to get the job done 
the pressure is going to tell king said it was never 
going to be a quick fix a twoweek wonder 
but cheney said he was certain sanctions were working he 
predicted the embargoes will erode iraqi president saddam husseins 
political base within months and reduce the fighting ability of his 
1 milliontroop army 
if i were in his saddams place tonight i would be 
concerned over the next few months he will see the erosion of his 
political base within iraq the erosion of his economy within iraq 
and the erosion of the capability of his enormous military 
machine 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd suggested last week that 
the effectiveness of sanctions should be assessed within weeks 
britain has deployed planes and naval ships to the gulf and is 
sending about 6000 combat troops including the desert rats 
tank regiment 
in a british broadcasting corp radio interview earlier monday 
cheney said the american public would support keeping troops in 
saudi arabia for some years 
were there as long as the saudis want us as long as it 
takes to get the job done and no one should underestimate our 
staying power he added 
he also said he believed iran will stick to the unsupported 
embargoes against iraq despite strengthening diplomatic relations 
with its former enemy 
the iranians are not in our opinion interested in seeing 
saddam hussein succeed theyve given every indication that they 
will for the most part carry through and enforce sanctions 
cheney said 
at the news conference cheney dismissed suggestions that us 
public support for the gulf deployment is eroding as attention 
switches to domestic economic problems 
the notion that somehow we have a short attention span a 
few weeks or months i dont think is valid he said

the united states did not give a goahead to 
syria in the ouster of gen michel aoun in lebanon and still urges 
all foreign forces to leave the country a state department 
spokeswoman said monday 
if youre asking me did the united states give syria a green 
light i would tell you absolutely not spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler told reporters 
she said us officials had no contact with syria about the 
participation of syrian troops in the weekend assault that forced 
aoun out of his beirut enclave to refuge in the french embassy 
the us government on saturday urged all lebanese to support 
president elias hrawi who has started reunifying beirut and moving 
to create a city free of armed groups after putting down aouns 
11month mutiny 
syrian and lebanese troops defeated aoun in an eighthour 
assault saturday that killed 160 people and wounded 800 
asked if the united states backs hrawis government in its call 
for aoun to face a court of law in lebanon ms tutwiler said 
our position has always been limited to advice that aoun step 
aside we have never taken a position on what should happen to him 
after doing so 
she said however that the us government hopes the matter 
will not delay the urgent work of national reconciliation 
ms tutwiler said syrian forces apparently were requested to 
help oust aoun by the legitimate government of lebanon but she 
added it is longstanding united states policy that all foreign 
forces in lebanon leave 
asked when a us ambassador would be sent to beirut she noted 
that the senate has not yet confirmed a new nominee and our 
determination on sending our ambassador back will be made as it 
has always been made when you take into consideration safety 
she said the government has no reaction to aouns ouster beyond 
saturdays statement which regretted the loss of life and said 
we hope that this ends a sad chapter in lebanons history and 
that the lebanese people can now move toward reconciliation and 
rebirth of a united sovereign and independent lebanon

americans may be getting closer to the ideal diet 
but they still eat too much fat cholesterol and sodium according 
to a federal report discussed here monday 
the department of agriculture report on the nations eating 
habits which includes the usdas revised dietary guidelines was 
the focus of the 73rd annual american dietetic association meeting 
participants discussed a draft of the report which is scheduled 
for release in its final form nov 5 
as in the past the usda will appeal to americans to consume 
less saturated fat sodium and cholesterol try a variety of foods 
that include plenty of vegetables fruits and grain products and 
maintain a healthy weight 
current diets contribute to high rates of heart disease high 
blood pressure and diabetes the report says but americans are 
coming closer to reaching usda guidelines for a healthy diet it 
said 
americans are doing pretty well said susan welsh the 
usdas director of human nutrition information services were 
definitely moving in the right direction but we still have a ways 
to go 
americans are meeting the usdas recommended daily allowances 
for nine of 15 essential vitamins and minerals welsh said 
but while fat intake has decreased over the past four years from 
40 percent to 36 percent of the average americans calories that 
level still is too high 
the usda has been recommending 30 percent of calories from 
fat so we have some work to do in that area welsh says 
health officials attending the meeting described how they are 
attempting to persuade americans to improve their diet 
usda representative betty peterkin said the revised dietary 
guidelines are expected to be similar to earlier guidelines but be 
more positive not prohibitive in tone 
the guidelines are expected to factor a persons body mass 
waist and hip size and medical status in determining an ideal 
weight peterkin said 
previously insurance industry tables used a persons height to 
determine the ideal weight 
the report said the guidelines will call for moderation 
cautioning americans to avoid extremes in their diets because both 
excessive eating and excessive dieting can be harmful 
welsh said awareness is the main barrier to overcome before 
americans completely integrate the guidelines into their diets 
theres often an inaccurate perception of ones own diet 
she said earlier surveys show that 50 percent of americans 
surveyed think their diets are all right but the surveys showed 
that only 12 percent had healthy diets

british designers have reinvented the sixties with 
a sexy snappy 90s swing for next spring and summer 
nostalgia for the 60s isnt surprising for the country that 
invented the miniskirt but the designers didnt wallow in it they 
pushed it forward into the very modern nineties with some of the 
best collections seen here in years 
the british look for 1991 is short simple and sexy 
the sportswear influence is strong with cropped jackets and 
shorts the hot favorites but the big news is that dresses are 
back especially skimpy shifts ala jacqueline kennedy onassis and 
audrey hepburn 
its definitely going to be a white summer in britain though 
the color palette runs from black and navy to summer pastels 
occasionally vivid tropical hues and a smattering of the bright 
and bold prints featured in milan 
its a 90s version of simplicity dressing said designer 
benny ong i think the 60s heralded the innocence of it and the 
90s makes a full circle and says now we have arrived i think the 
difference is its a realized woman who is dressing now and 
there is a choice 
designers who lived through the 60s caroline charles edina 
ronay and jean muir and those too young to remember arabella 
pollen jasper conran and bruce oldfield showed very individual 
wearable collections with an accent on youth at shows over the 
weekend and on monday

some in black and white prints set off by jackie kennedystyle 
pillbox hats and big sunglasses 
arabella pollen did her sexiest collection yet featuring 
houndstooth check jackets worn with hot pants or hipster miniskirts 
and minishifts for evening decorated with pieces of cut mirror a 
sort of neon hong kong the designer said 
bruce oldfield featured a pareddown look with fluid nautical 
print silk shifts trapeze dresses over slinky jersey bodysuits 
and glamorous asymmetrical sandcolored chiffons with gilt chains 
setting off the bust or derriere 
paul costello did his classic linen separates in sherbet colors 
and a lovely white linen shift but his backtofront jacket dresses 
in shiny brocades were less successful 
betty jackson mixed figurehugging pants with loose jackets and 
with an eye to the notsoyoung did some kneelength shifts edina 
ronay featured mint and pink pastel sequins for evening with 
chiffon and raw silk in the same colors jasper conrans lean and 
fluid classically tailored jackets shorts and short knifepleated 
skirts were back on the catwalk 
rifat ozbek who has the biggest international clout opted for 
a video presentation instead of a catwalk show titled 
afrodizzia it featured hot african colors sequins and prints 
as well as rasta ragamuffins in african print leggings and rough 
linen tops embroidered with compact discs 
london also kept its reputation for the wild and wacky 
vivienne westwood who originated punk fashion and won this 
years designer of the year marched to her own tune in her cut 
slash and pull collection it featured very demure 40sstyle 
tailored suits with midiskirts alongside slashed and ripped denim 
shorts and dresses and shocking bikinis and shorts embellished with 
bowtied phallic symbols 
westwood honored monday night at an award ceremony at royal 
albert hall developed the punk look and incorporated anarchy into 
fashion one of britains most unorthodox and influential 
designers she has designed for the sex pistols boy george and 
bananarama 
pam hoggs very sexy cotton bustiers peekaboo catsuits and 
shortshorts in dark red smoked green and mauve were worn by 
models with shaved heads and a wide grey stripe across their eyes 
workers for freedom the design duo of graham fraser and richard 
nott who won the 1989 designer of the year award picked delicate 
bondage for their theme some models were strapped into soft 
kneelength dresses with leather harnesses others wore brightly 
printed kimono styles and shirts with evil eyes 
body maps bodyhugging square collection showed the 
influence of mondrian prints ghosts featured clinging minis in 
lime and tangerine 
red or dead showed a short red playsuit in synthetic rubber 
diving suit material shorts with red shield stamps that peel off 
and baby dolls embroidered with kiss me quick and other 
sayings 
several designers noted there were very few american buyers and 
said it was due to the weak dollar and strong british pound but 
red or dead spokeswoman catherine morris said it had brought down 
its prices on clothes and was doing outrageously well in 
america

told 53 us senators on monday that pakistani courts not the us 
government will decide if ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
runs in this months general election 
in a letter to president ghulam ishaq khan 44 pakistani 
senators accused the us senators of interfering in pakistans 
domestic affairs and warned this could affect the already strained 
relations between washington and islamabad 
the letter comes at a time when antiamerican sentiment is 
growing over us influence in this moslem nation of 110 million 
people and the suspension of 573 million in economic and military 
assistance

assurances pakistan does not have a nuclear weapon some

provide law and order she is being tried before special onejudge 
tribunals that have drawn fire from all quarters as being obviously 
onesided

uspakistani relations if the 37yearold ms bhutto was not 
allowed to run 
some of the most influential members of pakistans 89member 
senate where ms bhuttos foes hold overwhelming control

as they desire but no political leader should be above the law and 
all leaders should obey the law they wrote

are not ready to compromise pakistans political sovereignty and 
national honor and will not tolerate interference in matters

search for killers of egypts parliament 
speaker continued for a fourth day with hundreds of suspects 
rounded up monday including iraqis palestinians and jordanian 
extremists 
the cabinet of prime minister atef sedki meanwhile recommended 
stricter security measures to safeguard against terrorist attempts 
after reviewing a report by abdelhalim moussa the interior 
minister in charge of police 
moussa said in his report that the killing of speaker rifaat 
elmahgoub his driver and four security men friday in cairo was 
carried out by arabs who infiltrated the country by using 
facilities provided to egyptians returning from kuwait and iraq 
according to the staterun newspaper al gomhouria 
the leading stateowned newspaper alahram said monday that 
security authorities have evidence the killers were arabs who had 
sneaked into egypt 
the government has accused iraq of sending saboteurs to spread 
terror in egypt to punish it for its opposition to iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
some government officials and analysts have been speculating 
that elmahgoubs murder was carried out by either iraqi agents or 
local moslem fundamentalists 
iraq has denied any involvement in the assassination saying the 
accusations were based on the promotion of lies and meant to 
cover up popular indignation against egypts support of the 
usled forces in the gulf region 
tuesdays editions of cairos newspapers said up to 300 suspects 
have been rounded up since friday they said 130 were arrested 
monday 
there were 22 palestinians iraqis jordanians and lebanese 
among those arrested monday no further breakdowns were given 
the arrested palestinians included a soldier in the the 
palestinian liberation army the report in alakhbar a third 
stateowned daily did not identify him further 
all the arrested suspects resembled composite sketches of five 
gunmen compiled from witnesses 
airport security officials said three arabs carrying australian 
american and syrian passports were arrested sunday but the 
official middle east news agency said the one with the us 
passport was released later 
in addition to the arabs alahram said an unspecified number of 
local moslem extremists were arrested for questioning about their 
possible connection with the assassination 
last week moussa announced the arrests of 35 alleged saboteurs 
and warned of possible terror attacks by iraqi agents he warned 
that officials would be targeted for assassination to punish egypt 
for its strong opposition to the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait

split years ago with the palestine liberation organization has

house negotiators agreed monday to give the 
steel industry more time to comply with tougher new toxic air 
pollution requirements congressional sources said 
the action moved a housesenate conference committee one step 
closer to overall agreement on the first reorganization of the 
nations federal clean air laws in 13 years 
the development appeared to set the stage for a settlement with 
the senate over new controls on toxic chemical emissions from 
industry as a whole 
the section on toxic emissions and another section on acid rain 
are the two major remaining unsettled issues before the conference 
committee 
separate clean air bills imposing new controls on factories 
utilities and automobiles were approved by the house and senate 
earlier this year the conference members have worked since 
midjuly to try and resolve differences in the two bills 
the talks between the house and senate became stalled over the 
weekend when the house members couldnt decide on whether special 
considerations should be given to certain industries such as steel 
the steel industry has vigorously argued that it would not be 
able to comply with the new requirements by the end of the decade 
and would have to shut down most of the nations coke ovens 
but by late monday the house negotiators decided to give steel 
companies an additional 20 years until the year 2020 to bring 
coke ovens in line with the rest of industry the senate proposal 
already has such a provision 
rep dennis eckart dohio who fought for special treatment for 
the steel industry said steel still would be faced with very 
tough standards 
beginning in 1998 steel companies would have to begin meeting 
specific milestones that will force the adoption of new 
pollution control technologies said eckart in an interview 
the reductions would be made primarily by installing new 
pollution control technology the agreement also would require 
industry to take additional actions if health risks to residents 
near a plant are still considered to exceed a certain level 
with the issue of the coke ovens resolved both senate and house 
sources expressed confidence an agreement can be worked out 
last week senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and 
house speaker thomas foley dwash told the negotiating teams 
they wanted a compromise clean air bill by midnight sunday with 
expectations of final floor votes this week 
but the sunday deadline passed with no agreement

tuberculosisrelated deaths should increase 
sharply because of the parallel epidemic of aids the world 
health organization warned monday 
a survey by the genevabased group estimated that almost half of 
the 6 million to 8 million people believed infected with the virus 
that causes aids also have tb which claims about 3 million lives 
annually and is the no 1 killer among contagious diseases 
data collected by who suggest those with both tb and the hiv 
virus develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome dramatically 
faster 
it is becoming a parallel epidemic and it is this trend that 
has public health officials worried said who directorgeneral 
dr hiroshi nakajima 
who estimates the number of hiv carriers could rise to 15 
million to 20 million by the end of the century 
thus because of the mirror nature of the two diseases who 
expects tb cases and deaths to rise sharply especially in africa 
latin america and south east asia said the survey 
the agency estimates 24 million people in subsaharan africa 
are infected with both diseases 300000 in latin america 200000 
in asia 100000 in the united states and 50000 in europe 
the aids virus is passed during sex or through bodily fluids 
but tuberculosis is transmitted through the air when infected 
people cough or sneeze 
last year nearly 8 million new tb cases were reported to who 
including 26 million in the lessdeveloped countries of the 
western pacific and 25 million in southeast asia 
the death toll ranged from 932000 in southeast asia to 42000 
in industrialized countries 
the survey said the increase in tb cases in central and east 
africa is overburdening the medical system if treated properly 98 
percent of infected tb patients can be cured it said 
in new york cases of tb have doubled since 1980 as many as 
100000 new cases are possible in coming years said jack adler 
director of the city health departments bureau of tuberculosis

the house approved legislation monday to 
create the post of chief financial officer for the us government 
a move designed to fight bureaucratic waste fraud and 
mismanagement 
the measure passed on a voice vote and now goes to the senate 
its chief sponsor rep john conyers dmich said the lack of 
a watchdog official with jurisdiction over the entire federal 
budget was one reason for a rash of scandals draining the federal 
treasury and undermining public confidence in government 
it is almost inconceivable that an organization which controls 
almost onefourth of the countrys gross national product has 
incompatible and outmoded financial management systems conyers 
said 
the bill would create a centralized and professional 
leadership structure at the office of management and budget he 
said 
the bush administration opposes the bill the omb said in a 
statement while supporting efforts to improve government 
management the bill would create confusion and blur the lines 
between the executive and legislative branches it said 
the administration favors establishing a deputy director for 
management and a governmentwide controller in omb as well as 
chief financial officer positions in each department the statement 
said 
a staffer with the house government operations committee which 
conyers chairs said the bill had been amended to address some of 
the administrations objections 
for example the latest version deletes a provision giving the 
chief financial officer a fouryear term also removed was a 
requirement that the president give his reasons to congress if he 
fires the officer 
the bill originally required a study of government accounting 
standards the administration said that would not be necessary 
because the treasury secretary comptroller general and omb 
director are establishing a federal accounting standards advisory 
board to perform the task 
the comptroller general is a congressional officer in charge of 
the general accounting office a congressional agency 
the latest version of the bill drops the study requirement but 
it would require the administration to submit accounting standards 
developed by the new advisory board to congress for approval before 
implementation

president francois mitterrand said monday he will 
reject any request by lebanese authorities to hand over rebel gen 
michel aoun who took refuge at the french embassy in beirut after 
his weekend defeat 
i will tell them in advance no mitterrand told a news 
conference 
gen aoun is a refugee at the french embassy he has demanded 
political asylum in france and france has granted it to him it is 
a matter of honor for her france she will protect gen aoun and 
his security 
aoun called on his rebel christian soldiers to surrender in the 
face of an attack by syrian and lebanese government forces 
saturday but lebanese authorities refuse to let him leave for 
france saying he should be put on trial 
aoun supporters occupying lebanons embassy in paris meanwhile 
alleged that syrian troops are killing aouns captured officers 
with gunshots to the head 
a spokesman for the protesters said family members of the 
officers had been contacted by telephone from paris he could not 
provide an estimate of the number of men killed 
the scores of aoun supporters occupying the paris embassy and 
lebanons consulate in marseille demand the generals safe passage 
to france 
mitterrand said france recognized the government of president 
elias hrawi and would not grant recognition to any aounled 
governmentinexile mitterrand also said aouns departure 
eliminated any justification for the presence of foreign troops in 
lebanon 
paris mayor jacques chirac and other leaders of the conservative 
opposition urged mitterrand to request an emergency meeting of the 
un security council to demand withdrawal of foreign troops from 
lebanon 
chirac also said france should stick to its offer of political 
asylum for aoun 
scores of aouns supporters occupied lebanons embassy in paris 
and consulate in marseille on monday demanding his safe passage to 
france after his defeat in beirut 
paris mayor jacques chirac and other leaders of the conservative 
opposition urged mitterrand to request an emergency meeting of the 
un security council to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops 
from lebanon 
chirac also said france should adhere to its offer of political 
asylum for aoun 
france is home to thousands of lebanese christians 
when aoun began his rebellion a year ago the french government 
was sympathetic to his goal of resisting domination by syria and 
its lebanese moslem allies this support eroded as aoun 
increasingly became perceived as an obstruction to any feasible 
peaceful settlement

new york boston and other eastern cities 
are gambling with catastrophes far worse than last years 
california earthquake if they dont prepare better for a major 
quake expected within 30 years 
that gloomy prediction monday from ian buckle deputy director 
of the national center for earthquake engineering research shook 
up a national quake conference two days before the anniversary of 
the oct 17 1989 loma prieta tremor 
the earthquake in the bay area last year is the writing on the 
wall for the east buckle told more than 300 scientists 
government officials and engineers at a national quake conference 
this is a race against time and the odds of winning do not 
look favorable buckle said 
the california quake on oct 17 1989 measured 71 on the 
richter scale killed 67 people and caused an estimated 6 billion 
in damage 
if an equally strong temblor struck an east coast city hundreds 
of thousands of apartment buildings would be in danger of 
collapsing along with some bridges roads and railroad passes 
buckle said the result would be huge death and injury tolls and 
tens of billions of dollars in damage he said 
buckle said seismologists estimate there is a better that 60 
percent chance that a magitude 6 quake will occur within 30 years 
the shaking in such a quake would be roughly 10 times less powerful 
than in the california quake but would still be very damaging in 
regions of the country with building standards less strict than 
californias 
in september researchers from the us geological survey and 
virginia polytechnic institute published a study estimating the 
chance of a damaging earthquake in the east they said the chance 
of a magnitude 60 quake somewhere in the east or lower midwest is 
29 percent by the year 2000 64 percent by the year 2020 and 97 
percent by the year 2090 
the odds were highest in the lower midwest which includes the 
new madrid fault zone where the new madrid fault lies next highest 
in the southeast and somewhat lower in new england 
new york city hit hard by a quake in 1884 may be doomed to 
suffer some of the worst damage because of its dense population and 
thousands of older buildings of unreinforced masonry 
if the 1884 quake estimated at 59 magnitude on the richter 
scale occurred now it would cause 11 billion to 26 billion in 
damage depending on its epicenter buckle predicted 
there would be a great deal of structural damage to all the 
unreinforced masonry and more than half of manhattan is of this 
kind said buckle a professor of civil engineering at the state 
university of new york in buffalo 
long suspension bridges and skyscrapers which are built to 
withstand strong wind would be less vulnerable to earthquake 
damage he said 
its the apartment buildings the 4story 5story 10story 
masonry buildings that have the right dynamic characteristics and 
the poor strength to be a recipe for disaster he said 
buildings of that type are common all along the atlantic 
seaboard where moderate and strong quakes have been recorded over 
the past 200 years charleston was struck by a quake estimated at 
75 magnitude in the 1800s and boston had an estimated 70 
magnitude in the 1700s 
some progress has been made in protecting east coast buildings 
from quakes buckle said 
massachusetts connecticut new jersey as well as new york city 
and memphis tenn have either adopted or are very close to 
adopting seismic provisions in their building codes but he said 
that would affect only new structures and wouldnt require older 
buildings to be renovated 
but more needs to be done he said 
the public clearly should learn what to do in an earthquake 
he said the dropandcover rules that california schoolchildren 
are taught should be taught to schoolchildren in new york and along 
the atlantic seaboard people should do things to improve the quake 
resistance of their homes

president bush on monday condemned ghastly 
atrocities by iraqi forces in occupied kuwait and warned saddam 
hussein that like nazi officials after world war ii he may face a 
warcrimes trial 
hitler revisited bush said of saddam but remember when 
hitlers war ended there were the nuremberg trials 
america will not stand aside the world will not allow the 
strong to swallow up the weak the president said 
bush leveled his warning as he opened a twoday trip to boost 
republican election hopes in texas nebraska iowa illinois and 
michigan 
the president combined his attack against saddam with a blast at 
congress for failing to enact a 500 billion package of tax hikes 
and spending cuts 
the american people have every right to expect more from their 
elected representatives said bush picking up on a widespread 
mood of public anger against elected officials 
the two conflicts one in the middle east and the other on 
capitol hill have become the staples of bushs campaign 
appearances 
every day now new word filters out about the ghastly 
atrocities perpetrated by saddams forces bush said at a 
fundraising luncheon for clayton williams the republican 
candidate for governor of texas 
bush recounted stories of kuwaiti babies being removed from 
incubators so the machines could be sent to baghdad similarly he 
said dialysis patients were taken from their machines so the 
machines could be used in iraq 
in another instance he said two youngsters who distributed 
leaflets were executed by iraqi forces as their parents were forced 
to watch 
bush said the incidents point up the cruel and senseless 
suffering endured by the people of kuwait a systematic assault on 
the soul of a nation 
the horrific descriptions paint a background against which the 
united states may seek new action in the united nations against 
iraq 
sources say the administration is considering a resolution that 
would condemn iraqs dismantling of kuwait declare iraq 
accountable for the damage there and specifically mention the 
possibility of military action 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the justice 
department has been compiling a list of violations committed in 
kuwait by iraqi forces he said other countries are keeping similar 
records 
the president simply wanted to make the point that saddam 
hussein has to be held accountable for his actions in kuwait were 
certainly open to considering various ways of doing that 
fitzwater said after bushs reference to the nuremberg trials 
he said bushs warning was aimed not only at saddam but also at 
officers of his armed forces and the soldiers themselves 
on the political front bush despite his 25 years of 
government service appeared to align himself with the 
antiestablishment feeling among voters i cant tell you what a 
pleasure it is to be out of washington he said to applause in 
dallas 
attacking the congress for its failure to enact a budget bush 
said if this is the best that the system can do then its time 
to build a better budget system 
in the texas race williams has outspent his democratic opponent 
21 and holds an 11 point lead according to an independent poll 
last week 
bushs second stop monday was in nebraska where republican gov 
kay orr was trailing her democratic challenger businessman ben 
nelson the most recent survey done for the omaha worldherald said 
nelson led mrs orr by 8 percentage points 44 percent to 36 
percent 
in omaha bush called saddam a dictator bully and said his 
aggression had been condemned by the united nations as well as most 
nations around the globe 
in spite of that condemnation there is this systematic 
dismantling of kuwait which is accompanied by unprecedented 
brutality bush said 
its an ugly scene bush added he was loudly applauded when 
he declared all that does is make me convinced even more than 
ever that this aggression by saddam hussein will not stand 
after a latenight flight bush was spending the evening in des 
moines where he will resume campaigning on tuesday 
bush made the budget mess a centerpiece of his speeches 
he said congress has missed its own budget deadlines 37 times in 
the last 10 years 
twice now this year ive signed emergency legislation to add 
more time to the clock the president said well this friday 
times up the american people deserve more than this stopgap 
government 
his statement reinforced administration warnings that bush will 
not sign another spending extension preferring instead to let the 
government shut down in the absence of a budget agreement 
bush was unwilling to say what he might accept in the way of tax 
increases 
im not going to say what i will or wont do bush told 
reporters on air force one as it left washington that managed to 
get a little confused last week 
over the course of the week bush signaled he was willing to 
accept higher taxes on the wealthiest americans in exchange for a 
sharply lower capital gains tax rate then the white house said 
bush had not espoused that strategy finally the white house said 
bush liked the idea but didnt think congress would approve it 
the president indicated a preference monday for a senate finance 
committee plan that would not affect income tax rates instead it 
would raise taxes on gasoline alcohol tobacco and luxury items 
and raise medicare taxes 
one of my biggest fears he said has always been that the 
congress will continue to pay for its spending habits by raising 
income taxes on everybody

the sacramento union said monday it will 
reject advertising for all movies carrying the new adultsonly 
nc17 rating 
the union a morning paper with a circulation of 70000 joins 
the 180000circulation birmingham news in alabama which last week 
banned nc17 ads the rating excludes all patrons under age 17 
the unions editor joseph farah said films carrying the new 
rating are nothing more than xrated films with a polite new 
name 
we consider the sacramento union a strong family paper and we 
believe accepting xrated movie ads whatever theyre called 
would be a contradiction of our image and philosophy he said in 
a statement 
the nc17 mark was created by the motion picture association of 
america on sept 26 to replace the x rating 
the x rating had became synonymous with hardcore sex films 
filmmakers asked that the new rating be created to identify 
maturethemed movies that they believed were not pornographic 
henry and june a universal pictures release is the first 
movie bearing the new nc17 rating the film is based on the erotic 
diaries of writer anais nin and chronicles her affairs with writer 
henry miller and his wife june 
the film playing on 189 screens grossed 14 million over the 
weekend for a strong perscreen average of 7408 so far it has 
made 28 million

the house passed legislation monday that would 
make certain that reservists called to active duty would not lose 
their jobs insurance coverage or rented homes 
the bill approved by voice vote and sent to the senate would 
modernize and strengthen protections previously granted for those 
called to active duty 
sponsors said activation of reserve forces in the persian gulf 
crisis made necessary an overhaul of the law 
one provision is designed to prevent eviction of a service 
members family living in a rented home or apartment 
while current law prohibits eviction without a court order the 
protection only extends to leases where the monthly payment is less 
than 150 the bill would extend the ceiling to 1200 
another provision provides that when reservists return to their 
jobs employers must provide health insurance benefits as if there 
had been no job interruption 
insurers would be required to reinstate the coverage as if no 
military service had occurred 
employment protection in current law only guarantees a reserve 
forces member a return to a prior job for 90 days of service the 
house bill would extend the protection for whatever period the 
service member was on active duty 
a special provision for health care professionals would relieve 
them from paying liability insurance premiums such as malpractice 
insurance the coverage would be suspended for the active duty 
period 
the bill would postpone court actions for damages while the 
insurance was suspended the action could be resumed when the 
insurance was reinstated

israels un envoy said monday his 
government would not receive a un delegation to investigate the 
israeli police killing of 19 palestinians but that israel would 
not keep out individual tourists 
after meeting secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to 
inform him of the israeli governments official position regarding 
a mission ambassador johanan bein told reporters if they want 
to get in as tourists they can come if they come they can see 
anybody israel is a free country 
but a delegation from the secretarygeneral will not be 
received by the government of israel 
un officials said they would not comment or announce a 
decision on sending a mission until they received answers to their 
questions from israel 
president bush said as he left on a political trip to texas and 
nebraska we want to see that un resolution fully 
implemented 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said america 
was disappointed that the israeli government has decided not to 
cooperate with the mission 
a stalemate could mean another meeting by the security council 
which ordered a un investigation friday night and open the door 
to further council involvement diplomats said 
israel opposes any un visit at this time even on a tourist 
basis 
western diplomats said meanwhile that discussions were under way 
to keep security council pressure on iraq to force its withdrawal 
from kuwait some diplomats said however that pressing too far 
could force the council to press further against israel 
a senior kuwaiti official said diplomats were talking about a 
possible resolution on reparations for damages to kuwait seizure 
of iraqi assets and limitations on the size of iraqi missions and 
on the movement of iraqi diplomats abroad 
such a resolution the official said might be brought to a vote 
next week despite the focus on violence in jerusalem 
the diplomats spoke on the condition of not being identified 
bein noted that an independent investigation in israel is under 
way in the temple mount shootings on oct 8 police intervened with 
tear gas rubber bullets and then live gunfire when thousands of 
palestinians hurled stones down on jews praying at the western 
wall or wailing wall 
everybody who comes to ben gurion airport can arrive bein 
said there are no limitations in israel but they un 
officials dont want to come as tourists if they want to come 
they want to come as a delegation and on that i gave the reaction 
of the government of israel 
the security council condemned the violence on friday and 
requested a un investigation into the deaths 
israel rejected the council action and the call for an outside 
investigation as a violation of israeli sovereignty in jerusalem 
and in the territories occupied in the 1967 mideast war 
israel wants to head off any investigation at the outset 
israeli sources said because it does not want to give the un 
security council any diplomatic toehold or any reason to take 
further action with regard to palestinians in israel and its 
occupied territories 
bein indicated the un request to visit may be reconsidered 
after israels commission delivers its report

flags at lincoln center were at halfstaff

bernstein whose passion at the podium versatility as a 
composer and performances on television helped make him the 
nations leading classical musician died sunday at his new york 
city apartment 
he died of sudden cardiac arrest caused by progressive lung 
deterioration from a tumor and emphysema four days after he 
retired on doctors orders his son alexander was at his side 
a private burial was scheduled for tuesday at the greenwood 
cemetery in brooklyn where his late wife actress felicia 
montealegre is buried 
bernstein wrote the scores for such classics as on the town 
and west side story he also lured countless thousands of 
babyboomers into the world of classical music with his emmy 
awardwinning young peoples concerts 
he was the most unique musician of this century there is no 
doubt about it said zubin mehta music director of the new york 
philharmonic and the israel philharmonic orchestra 
bernstein conducted his first new york philharmonic concert in 
1943 at age 25 when he was called on to fill in for bruno walter in 
a nationally broadcast radio concert 
i walked on with an awful hangover and dont remember another 
thing until i heard a thunderous ovation bernstein once 
recalled 
a memorial concert is planned for carnegie hall on nov 14 the 
47th anniversary of bernsteins philharmonic debut 
in 1958 bernstein became the philharmonics first americanborn 
director and served in that capacity until 1969 when he stepped 
down to devote more time to composing he served as laureate 
conductor until his death 
he was the new york philharmonic in its spirit and very 
essence and were going to miss him like crazy philharmonic 
director nick webster said 
beginning thursday night and continuing through oct 23 the 
philharmonic will perform an allbernstein program orchestra 
spokesman neil parker said the schedule had called for works by 
beethoven and shostakovich 
parker said a larger musical memorial is being planned and many 
celebrities have called asking to participate well have more 
about that in a day or so he added 
bernstein a heavy smoker announced his retirement from the 
concert stage thursday citing emphysema and other lung ailments 
his last conducting performance was aug 19 at tanglewood music 
center in massachusetts 
despite his increasing ill health he said then he planned to 
conduct an oct 28 aids benefit concert for the gay mens health 
crisis at carnegie hall sponsors said they will perform a musical 
tribute to bernstein that night 
as a conductor bernstein was known for his concert contortions 
jabbing leaping and even an occasional fall into the musicians 
pit 
bernstein believed conductors should be actors 
i dont mean that when the music is tragic youve got to act 
like barrymore in hamlet he once said but you have to 
indicate to the orchestra by your body and your face which is all 
youve got what the shape of the phrase is 
a man of strong passions bernsteins fiery professional style 
melded with his equally strong political beliefs 
he once led an orchestra performance at a liberated 
concentration camp raised money for the black panthers and 
celebrated the fall of the berlin wall with a performance of 
beethovens ninth symphony in berlin 
with him goes a spectacular special era in american music 
making violinist isaac stern said 
seiji ozawa the boston symphony orchestra conductor who in his 
20s was an assistant to bernstein in new york wiped tears from his 
eyes as he reflected on his mentor 
i had no money ozawa recalled he gave me many food and 
drink his wife felicia gave my wife a dress i think she still 
has it 
he was too much for one body ozawa said he lived 10 or 
20 times more than the usual persons one life 
colleagues who worked with bernstein said his greatest gift was 
the ability to bring out the best in a performer 
gerard schwarz music director of the seattle symphony said 
bernstein made every single player in an orchestra feel a part of 
something terribly important 
larry kert who played the original tony in the broadway 
production of west side story said that during the eight weeks 
of rehearsals leonard bernstein played for me every day 
he could have gotten a rehearsal pianist but he cared too 
much i was the new kid on the block and he stroked me and took 
care of me and i will never forget him for that 
the loss is too great to consider said jerome robbins who 
choreographed west side story 
in addition to his son bernstein is survived by two daughters 
jamie thomas and nina bernstein his 92yearold mother jennie of 
brookline mass ister shirley of new york and brother burton of 
bridgewater conn

the 192829 broadway season produced such hits 
as street scene by elmer rice holiday by philip barry 
the front page by ben hecht and charles macarthur and 
machinal by sophie treadwell 
machinal sophie treadwell 
leave it to joseph papp and his enterprising new team at the 
public theater to unearth a dramatic rarity as its first offering 
of the fall season and while not a longlost masterpiece 
machinal especially under michael greifs taut and tantalizing 
direction certainly deserves a major revival after more than 60 
years 
treadwell who died in 1970 was a prominent journalist 
novelist and playwright during and after world war i machinal 
is her best known play and it has had occasional smallscale 
revivals in new york over the years but the version which opened 
monday at the new york shakespeare festivals luesther hall is the 
first major reworking of the play 
greif has given it a fascinating production from the 
cacophonous opening scene of a busy manhattan office to the grim 
final moments on death row the evening is a series of 
expressionistic tableaux they are done in great style and with a 
firm sense for the period in which the story is set the 1920s are 
evoked by a bit of a popular song the flip of a short skirt or 
just the way the actors move across the floor 
machinal is an early feminist tract loosely adapted from 
the sensational 1927 murder case of ruth snyder sentenced to die 
in the electric chair for the murder of her husband 
its the story of a woman as victim battered by her mother 
husband and society into a submission that eventually leads to her 
downfall and death 
treadwells heroine a stenographer named helen jones marries 
her boss a porcine capitalist who spouts homilies about big 
business and marriage their marriage not only traps helen but 
nearly suffocates her 
a child doesnt help in fact the baby only makes her feel 
worse 
helen finds romance in a speakeasy where she meets a young man 
who was played in the original 1928 production by clark gable 
their love affair is doomed when she kills her husband a crime not 
depicted on stage 
the theater luesther hall with its high ceilings and bank of 
lighting fixtures enchances the design of the production created 
by david gallo actors quickly carry furniture off and on the 
stage 
light and dark are important components of that design and the 
lighting and even the lack of it by kenneth posner is 
startlingly effective 
the large cast is headed by jodie markell as the doomed helen 
shes sweet but also a little scary a demented woman who touches 
your heart too there are fine portraits by john seitz as her 
wealthy husband marge redmond as her nagging mother and william 
fichtner as the man she loves 
machinal is more than a theatrical curiosity its an 
interesting work by a forgotten playwright that helps us understand 
the past and its exactly the type of play the public theater 
should be reexamining

prime minister yitzhak shamir on monday accused 
the world of hypocrisy ignoring murders of israelis while 
condemning israel for killing 19 palestinians in jerusalem last 
week 
he also warned iraq in a speech to parliament that any 
intervention in neighboring jordan that upset jordanian stability 
would bring swift israeli retaliation 
shamir defended his cabinets rejection sunday of a un 
security council resolution urging a un investigation of the oct 
8 deaths on the temple mount 
israel defied the united states on a second issue announcing a 
new housing plan for soviet immigrants that ignores american pleas 
not to settle the wave of newly arrived soviets in occupied 
territory 
six of eight new residential communities announced sunday are to 
be in east jerusalem on territory captured by israel from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war and annexed 
america and most other nations do not recognize israels 
annexation the bush administration this year approved 400 million 
in loan guarantees for housing the soviets on condition it not be 
used beyond the 1967 line 
sundays decision was designed to reinforce israels claims to 
the city 
the heart of the jewish people needs to expand faster said 
housing minister ariel sharon there is no better answer to the 
political dangers than strengthening the jewish population 
leftwing parties on monday attacked the cabinet action 
regarding a un mission the largest opposition faction the 
centerleft labor party said it would join a noconfidence vote 
against shamirs conservative government 
shamir reacting to the security council condemnation said 
critics ignored that police charged the mount only after 
palestinians unleashed a barrage of stones at jewish worshipers at 
the adjacent western wall 
the citizens of israel and all jews everywhere cannot but be 
astonished and protest at the voices of criticism in which what 
stood out was an absence of any mention of the grave attack on the 
jewish peoples holiest place he said 
shamir complained that the security council failed to respond in 
any way to the murders of 16 israeli tourists in two attacks in 
egypt one in 1985 by a deranged egyptian policeman and another 
last february by unidentified gunmen 
we did not hear similar denunciations and we did not see the 
security council being convened when whole families were murdered 
in ras bourka or when buses carrying israel tourists were 
attacked he said 
shamir did not follow other israeli politicians in directly 
criticizing the united states israels chief ally for joining in 
the unanimous security council vote 
but he suggested backing for the resolution was motivated by the 
need to hold together the usbacked force against iraqi president 
saddam husseins takeover of kuwait 
the security council decision was a onesided decision 
he said one can only conjecture about its motives and the 
support it received in the present international situation 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
expressed disappointment in israels decision not to cooperate with 
the un investigators 
we think that a failure to cooperate denies israel an 
opportunity to present its case she said 
at the united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday he was undecided whether to dispatch a team and would 
wait to hear israels position 
in his speech shamir also condemned the international community 
for urging israel to accept increased us arms sales to arab 
states while saddam has repeatedly threatened an attack on the 
jewish state 
the 74yearold leader of the rightwing likud bloc appeared to 
step up israeli warnings to iraq 
while previous israeli statments have pledged retaliation for an 
invasion of jordan shamir said israel will not hesitate to react 
in any way we see fit if there is an attempt to undermind 
jordans stability 
any intervention in the situation there or intervention in its 
territory by another state is likely to raise tensions to 
levels we cannot accept he said 
in a response to shamirs speech labor party leader shimon 
peres told parliament that the rightwing government was ruining 
israels standing in the world and upsetting its alliance with the 
united states 
he told a news conference later that labor would join in a 
noconfidence vote expected next week and said the cabinets 
reaction to the un investigation kept international attention on 
israel and away from the gulf crisis 
we with our own hands instead of extinguishing the fire we 
are increasing the flames peres said 
shamirs defense of the cabinet decision also followed questions 
by israeli human rights activists as to the governments account of 
the temple mount slayings they indicated the government had 
overstated the dangers to police and civilians from rioting 
palestinians 
in storming the temple mount a site holy to both moslems and 
jews police wounded more than 140 arabs in addition to killing 
19 a halfdozen police and 28 israelis were injured in the stoning 
beforehand 
on sunday the israeli human rights group betselem accused the 
police of firing indiscriminately and noted the light character 
of injuries to both police and civilians

republican candidate jon grunseth vowed 
monday to stay in the governors race and prove that he is innocent 
of allegations that he encouraged four teenage girls to join him 
for a nude swim at a 1981 party 
two women alleged in sworn statements that they attended an 
independence day party at grunseths home when they were 13 and 14 
years old 
they said grunseth encouraged them his daughter nina and 
another girl to join him for a nude swim and one of them alleged 
that he tried to touch her breast one of the women said grunseth 
swam naked but that both girls wore bathing suits 
grunseth maintained that his campaign opponent democratic gov 
rudy perpich was the driving force behind the allegations 
which he said are absolutely false 
before this is over there will be many witnesses who will say 
that this charge is impossible grunseth told a news conference 
it will take us a while to find them but we will find them in 
the near future 
we cant bring action get this into court prior to the 
election he said thats whats so sad about this 
perpich said he knew nothing of the allegations before a 
reporter called him over the weekend i had no contact with these 
people he said its bizarre to say we in any way had anything 
to do with this period 
the women making the allegations said they decided to come 
forward with the story because of the governors race they made 
the sworn statements with the help of a lawyer and provided them to 
the star tribune of minneapolis which reported them monday they 
later provided the statements to other journalists 
nina grunseth now 23 said the allegation against her father 
is totally untrue i know my father and i do not believe under 
any circumstances he committed the act of which he is accused or 
any similar act 
she said one of the women making the allegations told her in a 
telephone conversation sept 29 that if her father would drop out 
of the governors race no other allegations would be made 
against him and both of our names would be kept out of the 
newspaper 
grunseth aides planned to ask the us attorneys office to 
determine whether either extortion or blackmail is involved said 
spokesman elam baer 
the allegations were made by liane nelson now 23 and a social 
worker dealing with sexual abuse cases in the boston area and her 
cousin elizabeth mulay 22 of san jose calif 
nelson said she decided to speak out nine years later because 
she believes there was sexual impropriety at the party i think 
that is extremely inappropriate behavior for someone who wants to 
be governor she told the star tribune 
she didnt respond to a reporters message lft on her telephone 
answering machine monday mulays telephone number is unlisted 
grunseth has noted that nelsons parents have been active in 
democratic politics in minneapolis in the past 
in her statement mulay said grunseth suggested we all take 
our swimsuits off 
my cousin and i were adamant about not taking them off she 
said at one point he grunseth cornered me in the pool i 
tried to swim by but he blocked me in 
mulay alleged that grunseth tried to pull her bathingsuit strap 
down and to grab her breast but he missed 
the perpich campaign has in recent weeks focused on grunseths 
temporary refusal to pay some courtordered childsupport and 
health insurance payments after his 1983 divorce and for being 
delinquent in paying some of his property taxes

hyong muk in the second round of discussions between the rival 
nations since the peninsula was divided in 1945 the two prime 
ministers met in the south korean capital of seoul in september 
south korea has recognized communist north korea as a separate 
nation but the north has refused to do the same its southern 
neighbor claiming it would perpetuate division 
south korea has said there can be no significant progress in 
ending hostilities until both governments officially accept each 
others existence 
the military demarcation line is a barrier of distrust and 
confrontation that has blocked travel and any meeting between our 
people and has brought bitter anguish and distrust kang said 
before crossing the border at the village of panmunjom in the 
demilitarized zone between the nations 
kang and the 90member delegation were greeted by young north 
korean girls dressed in brightly colored traditional gowns and 
carrying flowers

a federal judge on monday barred the media 
from jury selection in the bribery trial of a legislator snared in 
an fbi investigation into votebuying in the south carolina 
statehouse 
the unexpected media ban by us district judge falcon hawkins 
kept a veil of secrecy over legal proceedings for state rep luther 
taylor taylors attorneys have argued that further disclosures 
about the case would make it impossible to seat an impartial jury 
taylor 40 a democrat from columbia is one of nine state 
lawmakers indicted by a federal grand jury in august and september 
on charges of taking bribes in exchange for their support of a bill 
legalizing betting on horses and greyhounds 
they were charged under the hobbs act a federal law banning 
acceptance of money or gifts in return for votes or favors four 
lawmakers have already pleaded guilty to bribery a fifth has 
pleaded guilty to a drug charge that came up in the course of the 
investigation 
by monday night seven jurors had been seated the jury will be 
composed of 12 jurors and three alternates 
after hawkins barred the media from jury selection monday 
attorneys for south carolina news organizations lodged an emergency 
appeal before the 4th us circuit of appeals in richmond va 
hawkins also has issued a gag order barring participants from 
discussing the case outside court aother order sealing court 
records in the cases of taylor and three other lawmakers charged 
separately is under appeal 
there has to be a balancing process so that any restriction on 
our right of access is as narrow as can be and still protecting the 
sixth amendment right of a fair trial said jay bender of the 
south carolina press association 
we think the first amendment is first bender said the 
first amendment guarantees the right to free speech 
the judge said he feared potential jurors might be more 
circumspect in answering questions from attorneys if reporters were 
present 
if they know what theyre saying is to be public i am of the 
opinion they will not be near as candid hawkins said 
taylors attorney joel collins did not file a motion to bar 
the media from jury selection but argued the presence of reporters 
would jeopardize taylors right to a fair trial 
bender citing the lack of compelling government interest in 
sealing the proceedings offered alternatives such as identifying 
jurors by numbers 
taylor has pleaded innocent to charges he took 4300 in bribes 
this year in exchange for supporting a parimutuel betting bill he 
is also charged with conspiring to obtain bribes 
he has served in the state house of representatives since 1983 
if convicted taylor faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in 
prison and a fine of 15 million 
the 16month fbi sting employed a former house 
memberturnedlobbyist ron cobb who pretended to represent an 
atlanta organization that supported efforts to legalize parimutuel 
betting on horses and greyhounds in south carolina the indictment 
alleged taylor met with cobb and agreed to accept money for 
supporting the parimutuel bill it also alleged he agreed to 
recruit other lawmakers to support the bill

the world president bush said joining in a tide of warm praise 
from leaders ranging from german chancellor helmut kohl to the 1983 
winner polands lech walesa 
british prime minister margaret thatcher termed the award 
terrific and richly deserved and others said it may help 
president gorbachevs efforts to boost the sagging soviet economy 
i am of the opinion that if ever an award was justified this 
was it german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said in an 
interview with the colognebased deutschlandfunk radio station 
in awarding the prize the norwegian nobel committee cited 
gorbachev for his decisive role in the easts and wests drawing 
closer together and allowing greater openness in his homeland 
echoing the committee bush said gorbachev has brought 
historically signficant change both political and economic to the 
soviet union and to eastern europe 
former president jimmy carter speaking at moravian college in 
bethlehem pa said gorbachev would have been my choice 
his selection is long overdue in my opinion in this 
hemisphere no one else alive or who has lived in this century has 
so beneficially changed the world political society as has mikhail 
gorbachev 
he got the vietnamese out of kampuchea cambodia he got his 
soviet troops out of afghanistan he brought freedom in a great 
degree to the people of the soviet union hes made possible the 
liberation of eastern european countries hes been a strong 
enforceable leader even when the united states opposed bringing 
about nuclear arms reductions so in many ways hes superlative 
polish trade union leader walesa said he wished gorbachev 
further persistence and successes on the road to democracy that 
you have outlined 
it was the first peace prize awarded to a soviet or us chief 
executive since president woodrow wilson won in 1919 
israeli president chaim herzog said he believed gorbachevs 
policies will bring freedom and happiness to many peoples and 
advance peace throughout the world and particularly in the middle 
east 
herzog said gorbachevs role in opening the way for more jews to 
emigrate to israel will be remembered for many generations and 
the entire jewish people is full of gratitude 
from los angeles former president reagan congratulated his 
friend calling the prize a welldeserved tribute to his bold 
and courageous leadership 
under president gorbachev the soviet union is making 
fundamental and necessary changes in its political and economic 
systems changes which will give the soviet people the freedoms 
they deserve he said 
germanys kohl said in a telegram to gorbachev your personal 
contribution to the improvement of relations between east and west 
to overcoming the division of our continent to breakthroughs in 
disarmament and arms controls and solutions of regional conflicts 
is worthy of highly deserved praise 
in spain foreign minister fernandez ordonez called the award an 
act of justice 
italys premier giulio andreotti said the announcement filled 
me with joy 
united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told 
reporters gorbachev had not only contributed in a remarkable 
manner to detente but to enhancing the role of the un as a 
peacemaking and peacekeeping center 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said the prize may 
boost gorbachevs standing in efforts for domestic economic reform 
it wont help him out of his economic predicament london 
school of economics soviet expert margot light said but it may 
make his political position slightly more stable 
citing the 59yearold gorbachevs contribution to the cause of 
freedom portuguese president mario soares said it is a choice 
that i applaud with both hands enthusiastically and without 
reserve 
president patricio aylwin of chile called gorbachev a man who 
has had the enormous courage of pushing democratic and liberalizing 
reforms his efforts have definitely contributed to 
strengthening peace around the world 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari said in a message of 
congratulations your leadership and historical vision have 
decisively contributed to strengthening peace and detente in the 
world 
bulgarias president zhelyu zhelev told gorbachev he deserved 
the reward for his extraordinary contribution to the dismantling 
of the totalitarian system and for the creation of a new 
political climate in europe and the world in which peace and 
cooperation among all peoples are the most cherished values 
not all reaction was positive 
latvian historian jan saltsmanis whose homeland is among the 
baltic republics fighting for independence from the soviet union 
said the west was too impressed with gorbachev 
i reacted with dismay he told the radio in sweden where he 
has lived since 1945 gorbachev has opened up borders he 
deserves a certain merit for the development but you should 
not overestimate his significance in the context

hundreds of dead dogs the remains of a 
cold war radiation experiment were shipped to the hanford nuclear 
reservation for burial last month coming next 175 tons of their 
radioactive excrement 
the 560squaremile federal reservation in southcentral 
washington already is a repository for millions of gallons of 
radioactive waste left over from decades of nuclear weapons 
production it also has accepted defunct navy nuclear subs and 
retired reactors for burial 
the 828 dead beagles shipped from california in 55gallon 
drums were buried in trenches at hanford a few weeks ago their 
remains had been stored in freezers at the institute of toxicology 
and environmental health on the university of california campus at 
davis 
the last dog died at the age of 18 in 1986 27 years after 
governmentfunded beagle experiments began at the university 
the beagle cleanup expected to cost about 22 million is part 
of a nationwide department of energy effort to clean up radiation 
contamination at university labs where government research was 
conducted 
the dogs left behind tons of urine and feces since the wastes 
are radioactive they also must be buried and shipped under 
regulations governing lowlevel radioactive waste 
the burial closes a chapter in a government effort to test the 
effects of radioactive fallout 
several west coast universities were paid to conduct animal 
experiments in the late 1950s when public concern about fallout 
from openair nuclear weapons tests was mounting 
at birth the dogs either were put on a diet of boneseeking 
strontium90 irradiated with cobalt60 or injected with radium 
about a year and a half later the treatment would stop and the 
dogs would be sent to live in outdoor cages until they died 
the experiments have shown that dogs fed high doses of radiation 
get cancer more quickly than people the dogs who received the 
lowest doses didnt get cancer said dr otto raabe who has 
directed beagle research at the university of california at davis 
for the last 15 years 
in a similar case in iowa environmental groups have reacted 
angrily to a plan to incinerate hundreds of slightly radioactive 
carcasses of dogs that were injected with radioactive isotopes in 
experiments to improve human health at the university of iowa the 
university has run out of storage space

a federal judge monday ordered a hearing on 
whether jurors who convicted four men on charges stemming from the 
1985 kidnap and murder of a us drug agent were exposed to outside 
information 
i believe it is necessary to hold an evidentiary hearing to 
determine the precise nature of the extraneous information that 
reached the jury us district judge edward rafeedie said it 
is unclear what the jury was exposed to 
defense lawyers asked rafeedie to order a new trial based on 
statements by one juror that other members of the jury had heard or 
seen news accounts of the case before returning their verdicts 
against the four defendants 
juan ramon matta ballesteros ruben zuno arce and juan jose 
bernabe ramirez were convicted of various charges of conspiracy 
kidnap and violent crimes in aid of racketeering the case stems 
from the 1985 killing of enrique camarena a us drug enforcement 
administration agent 
javier vasquez velasco was convicted of violent crimes in aid of 
racketeering for the deaths of two americans who were reportedly 
mistaken for dea agents in a guadalajara restaurant the week before 
camarena disappeared 
prosecutors say mexican drug traffickers killed camarena in 
retribution for successful drug interdiction efforts in the 
guadalajara area 
so far 22 people have been charged in this country in 
connection with camarenas slaying more than 20 have been 
convicted in mexico

dow jones amp co is freezing budgets for capital 
spending and salaries and imposing other news and business cutbacks 
to cope with weak financial results and the sluggish economy 
the cuts announced in an internal memo to managers oct 11 
followed weeks of rumors about a possible retrenchment and 
triggered concern over possible future layoffs at the media and 
financial industry giant 
earlier in the week dow jones announced a 175 percent drop in 
thirdquarter profit reflecting a steady downturn attributed 
principally to the companys acquisition of the financial 
information service telerate inc 
dow jones also has been hurt by the recession plaguing wall 
street since the 1987 stock market crash 
operating income at dow jones business publications which 
include the wall street journal and barrons weekly dropped 80 
percent in the second quarter advertising linage at the journal 
dropped 16 percent in the period 
the internal memo from chairman warren h phillips and president 
peter r kann freezes all capital expenditures immediately and 
holds all 1991 department budgets including total salary costs 
at 1990 levels accounting for inflation the budget cut would 
amount to more than 5 percent for 1991 
the memo also said dow jones would reduce management bonuses 
next year eliminate all temporary help try to eliminate all 
editorial staff relocations and reduce space devoted to news in the 
journal 
its likely we like many other companies in our industry 
will be facing adverse market conditions for most of our 
publications and services particularly in the us in 1991 the 
memo said 
the memo said the cuts were the preferred method of trimming 
our costs structure but phillips and kann said they could not 
guarantee they would meet company goals the memo did not rule out 
layoffs 
the memo said dow jones would sell its corporate jet and reduce 
its aviation staff and sell excess land purchased for journal 
printing plant expansion and printing presses in storage 
among other editorial reductions the memo said dow jones would 
reduce journal special report inserts and table plans for a journal 
magazine among other moves to contain or reduce costs

knightridder inc unveiled a redesigned 
newspaper oct 11 that seeks a share of quality time in this baby 
boomerrich suburb 
the news a reconstituted 35yearold daily takes its visual 
cues from usa today with heavy use of color maps and indexes 
eyecatching graphics and clean lines 
in content short trendy stories will be the norm broadsheet 
sections have been reserved for the top news local developments 
business and sports feature articles are offered in a tabloid 
magazine called essentials 
what we did was to take a very specific community and say if 
we were reinventing the newspaper if a newspaper didnt exist in 
this place and we were trying to create a newspaper that we 
thought would have the greatest appeal to the people in this 
community what would it be said james batten knightridder 
chairman and chief executive officer 
while many newspapers have evolved along similar lines in recent 
years knightridder put in two years researching approaches aimed 
at baby boomers the result transformed the boca raton news into 
the news 
people were skeptical at first because they were afraid we 
were trying to reinvent usa today for the local area said lou 
heldman the projects corporate coordinator it is meant to have 
all of the traditional journalistic components to do investigative 
reporting to be a watchdog over government and institutions to 
run stories with an edge when thats called for and to not 
homogenize the writing style 
wayne ezell editor of the news said we dont spend much 
time in the business asking ourselves what our readers are 
interested in we tend to engage people who read newspapers we 
need to talk to the people who dont read newspapers 
the newspaper whose circulation is estimated at 40000 has 
been tailored specifically for boca raton a community of 67000 
people between fort lauderdale and west palm beach its image is 
that of an upscale retirement haven but 30 percent of the 
population is in the baby boomer pool half of whom have arrived in 
the past five years 
loyal older readers havent been left out a focus group study 
of readers over age 45 showed that its a bigger hit frankly with 
the older readers than the younger readers he said 
batten said he regards the news as a laboratory testing 
potential applications for knightridders other papers

the supreme court boosted a bid by the 
nations seven regional telephone companies to provide electronic 
information services to homes and businesses 
the court without comment oct 9 rejected an appeal aimed at 
making it harder for the companies to enter the developing 
industry 
the underlying issue is whether the companies should be allowed 
to use their phone lines to sell such information as stock market 
quotes and electronic yellow pages with homeshopping and 
classified advertising 
last april the us circuit court of appeals here threw out 
part of a 1987 lower court ruling that barred the companies from 
selling the information services 
the appeals court said the ruling by us district judge harold 
greene who has overseen the breakup of the atampt phone monopoly for 
more than a decade was too strict it sent the case back to him 
with instructions to use a more lenient test whether lifting the 
ban would be in the public interest 
asking the supreme court for help was a coalition of consumer 
groups longdistance phone companies equipment manufacturers 
dataprocessing businesses and newspapers that want to enter the 
athome information market 
the coalition including the american newspaper publishers 
association said the appeals court ruling jeopardizes the vigorous 
economic growth spawned by the breakup of atampt in 1984 
the phone companies said that their opponents are trying to kill 
legitimate competition and that most americans will be slow in 
getting information services unless the baby bells participate

increase in gasoline prices were the most closely followed stories 
during september but americans paid much less attention to the 
federal budget crunch a media group reported 
the times mirror center for the people amp the press said oct 10 
that 68 percent of americans surveyed said the mideast crisis was 
the most important news of september 
sixtythree percent said they were following very closely news 
about the us troop deployment to saudi arabia and other 
developments in the wake of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait that 
was the same percentage as in august 
sixtytwo percent said they paid close attention to stories 
about rising gasoline prices up from 56 percent in august 
the percentage of the public who paid close attention to news 
about hostages held in iraq and kuwait declined from 57 percent to 
47 percent

negotiations broke down and a government shutdown was ordered only 
34 percent said they were closely following news about efforts to 
resolve the budget impasse

the times mirror center for the people amp the 
press said it wrongly reported that a national poll it took last 
month found that 51 percent of the people surveyed associated 
republicans with rich powerful moneyed interests 
the correct figure was 21 percent the center said oct 12 
in a previous poll three years ago 18 percent made such an 
association the big jump to 51 percent was widely published and 
frequently cited by political commentators 
times mirror said that the incorrect figure was due to a 
computing error 
it said it also overstated the percentage of people who 
spontaneously said they associated republicanism with conservatism 
being businessoriented and not being for the people 
scott sowry a spokesman for the republican national committee 
said the party was certain that the apparent jump was an error 
thats what weve been saying all along sowry said

first newspaper to reject advertising for the new nc17 adultsonly 
film henry amp june 
the afternoon paper rejected ads for the universal pictures 
release and said it would refuse ad copy for all subsequent nc17

an erotic drawing is based on the diaries of anais nin and 
chronicles her affairs with writer henry miller and his wife 
it was the first released under the motion picture association 
of americas new rating which excludes anyone under 18 and 
replaces the x rating

place media ads 
jack valenti association president condemned the news blanket 
prohibition on nc17 films if a newspaper wants to live in the 
stone age i cant do anything about it he said 
in an editorial oct 7 the news said smut was still smut 
and the nc17 rating could lead to more violent or erotic fare 
drawing audiences that might have been turned off by the stigma 
of an x rating

the policy of the birmingham news in reviewing and accepting 
advertising for movies will not change as a result of the decision 
to replace the old x designation with the new nc17

the business editor and a reporter 
for the st petersburg times have been ousted in a 
conflictofinterest dispute that raises questions about what 
personal financial activity is appropriate for journalists 
the episode began late last month when reporter james greiff 
disclosed he had been shortselling stock of wells fargo amp co the 
san franciscobased bank 
after consulting with top editors business editor leonard m 
apcar dismissed greiff on oct 3 two days later apcar quit under 
pressure after the superiors learned his individual retirement 
account was invested in a mutual fund containing banc one corp of 
columbus ohio 
business journalism ethics have received increased scrutiny 
since the 1985 insider trading conviction of r foster wi in shortselling 
an investor sells borrowed stock on the 
expectation the price of the issue will decline the investor 
profits if the price drops and the shares usually borrowed from a 
broker can be replaced at a lower price 
the risky strategy forbidden to journalists by at least one 
major business publication amounts to a bet that a companys stock 
price will drop 
theoretically a reporter writing a negative article about a 
company could short the stock of that company expecting the 
story to drive down the price greiff said he had not written about 
wells fargo he was accused only of bad judgment not any 
wrongdoing 
following greiffs dismissal apcar said he told his immediate 
supervisor that he had bank stock in an ira but he didnt name the 
bank 
greiff meanwhile said he told times executives that apcar held 
shares of banc one which had been mentioned in a story by greiff 
as a possible suitor for a florida bank apcar had edited the story 
and decided his mutualfund holding presented no conflict 
on oct 4 after rumors that apcar owned stock in the bank 
filtered through the newsroom apcar said he voluntarily told his 
supervisor that banc one was in the mutual fund a day later foley 
asked apcar to resign 
mutual funds typically contain baskets of different stocks and 
other securities their contents usually are decided by fund 
managers not investors in an ira investors cannot withdraw money 
without penalty until retirement 
youre not in a mutual fund for a short period of 
time said apcar who was hired by the times in early 1989 after 
more than 12 years as a reporter at the wall street journal 
youre in for the long haul unless you trade and i dont 
trade 
the times conflictofinterest policy does not specifically bar 
any investments but cautions reporters to avoid even the appearance 
of a conflict and to raise questions with superiors 
greiff a times reporter for more than five years said he did 
not violate any policy written or spoken he said business writers 
were told only not to invest in companies they cover or ones based 
in florida 
within 10 minutes after placing my order with my broker i told 
several people in my department and told len he said i said 
do you have any problem with it and he said no apcar said he 
did not respond immediately to greiffs comments 
it went from being no problem to being a problem to being a 
firing offense in a matter of a few days greiff said 
rules governing reporters investments vary widely dow jones amp 
co which owns the wall street journal has what is considered to 
be the strictest conflictofinterest policy in the nation 
reporters and other staffers are barred from shortterm trading 
and must hold securities at least six months they cannot trade 
futures or options or sell short reporters and their families are 
prohibited from investing in companies related to their coverage 
areas 
the society of american business editors amp writers ethics code 
urges avoiding even the appearance of conflict it calls for 
skirting active trading and other shortterm profitseeking 
opportunities 
some editors said newspapers may be at fault if they discipline

the supreme court revived a 4 billion lawsuit 
by a millionaire inventor who says abcs 2020 falsely 
portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite 
the justices told a federal appeals court oct 9 to restudy 
arthur jones libel suit over the 1987 report on the fate of 63 
baby elephants jones rescued from death in africa 
the justices said the case should be reconsidered in light of 
their june ruling that the constitutions guarantee of free speech 
did not create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything that 
might be labeled opinion 
the june decision however did not strip away constitutional 
immunity for pure expressions of opinion that cannot be proved true 
or false 
jones the inventor of nautilus exercise machines was the 
subject of a 2020 broadcast in 1984 the year he flew the 63 
elephants from zimbabwe to the ocala fla farm he calls 
jumbolair 
the elephants had been marked for death as part of a culling or 
herd thinning operation 
the elephants lived on jones ocala estate until the summer of 
1986 when the herd began to be dispersed 
the 1987 report aired by 2020 was preceded by a comment by 
host barbara walters that it would discuss the fate of some baby 
elephants to whom a promise was not kept 
according to jones suit that comment and others contained in 
the report falsely cast him as a liar and a hypocrite and 
accused him of animal cruelty 
us district judge elizabeth kovachevich dismissed the suit 
before it reached a jury she ruled that some of the comments cited 
in the lawsuit were not defamatory and that those which might be 
were expressions of opinion not statements of fact 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal in 
december 
lawyers for abc urging the justices to reject jones appeal 
said the broadcast simply does not contain statements 
accusing him of hypocrisy lying unscrupulousness and cruelty to 
animals

the editor of pravda says he survived a mutiny by 
reporters who want to raise plummeting circulation by replacing 
rambling speech text with more lively copy 
on oct 11 pravda published an unsigned denial of reports that 
the newspapers communist party organization called last week for 
the resignation of ivan frolov who was appointed editor a year 
ago 
the notice buried on page 8 acknowledged that the newspapers 
party organization had sharp sometimes tough discussions 
during two days of meetings and that criticism of the leadership 
was expressed 
but it said the meetings did not adopt a noconfidence 
resolution in the chief editor 
frolov said at an unusual news conference on oct 10 that 
these people thought they could organize a minicoup 
outside in the hallway pravda writers held what they called a 
parallel news conference about their efforts to unseat frolov 
they said they sought to improve the newspaper officially 
described as the organ of the central committee of the communist 
party 
pravda satirist vladislav yegorov told reporters the party 
organization at the newspaper had passed a resolution asking the 
central committee to review the question of the editorial 
board 
he said 140 workers at pravda who are members of the communist 
party cell had considered calling for frolovs resignation but 
dropped the idea as too provocative 
last year pravdas circulation dropped by 3 million to about 7 
million and it appears to be falling further during a subscription 
drive now under way yegorov said 
he said readers were bored by the format of pravda which last 
week devoted its pages to the full texts of speeches from a twoday 
meeting of the communist partys central committee a body of 
diminishing relevance in soviet politics 
our readers dont want that said yegorov the most 
important thing is to make it a newspaper that is interesting to 
readers

out at the media oct 15 blaming television for the bloody 
crackdown on chinas prodemocracy movement and the western press

union which comprises more than 500 newspapers news agencies and

i believe it is this contextless television experience that 
led to the tragedy of tiananmen on june 4 he said

reports on demonstrations in the philippines and student protests 
in south korea 
chinas students forgot that china was a very different 
country from either the philippines or south korea two countries 
with close links to the united states where the media and congress 
wield immense influence he said 
lee also blasted the foreign press in hong kong for trying to 
foist western values on the british colony

reading president bushs lips was a lot easier 
than reading his mind about taxes as demonstrated in his onoff 
switch on a bargain to boost the top income tax rate 
after raising the possibility bush hedged reopened hedged 
and for a while seemed to be enjoying the confusion before he 
finally said no deal 
that stirred up the chronic factional strife in congress and 
within the republican minority escalated the discord over an 
assortment of rival budget plans and threats 
the white house and congress republicans and democrats all look 
like losers in the stalemate over their most basic assignment the 
long overdue task of financing federal operations 
doomsday comes on friday when the government again will run out 
of spending authority unless the congress finally produces a budget 
and bush signs off on its terms 
it is a deadline bush said he will not waive by accepting a 
temporary extension of spending authority without an overall budget 
settlement he said the clock is going to keep running because 
without that pressure congress wouldnt do anything 
they are going to have to stay in town and pass a budget 
vice president dan quayle said in a cbs interview as the rival tax 
writers staked their latest positions on the sunday television talk 
shows the president is simply not going to let the congress go 
home until they pass a good deficitreduction plan that is going to 
avoid a recession 
beyond that there has been no clear white house strategy since 
the rejection of the earlier budget deal produced in five months 
of negotiations and abruptly spurned by the house 
there certainly was no game plan showing last week when bush 
reopened the old idea of swapping an increase in the top tax rate 
for a cut in capital gains taxes the latter an elusive goal of his 
since the 1988 campaign 
he said there would have to be proper balance between the boost 
and the cut the idea was tried in summit negotiations and failed 
because democrats and republicans never could agree on a proper 
balance democrats wanted a higher tax rate and a smaller capital 
gains reduction than bush was willing to accept 
in rerun the same dispute made the same deadlock inevitable 
after reviving the idea bush gave republican senators the 
impression hed drop it but his spokesman then revived it 
campaigning last wednesday the president seemed to be enjoying the 
confusion he even parodied his most famous campaign slogan read 
my hips he said when asked while jogging whether he was 
dropping the capital gains reduction 
finally in a written statement on thursday he said he didnt 
think the trade would work and called it a waste of time 
indeed im quite concerned that pursuing it in the current 
context may not only fail it may legitimize something farther to 
the left that we cannot accept bush said 
he didnt say why he restarted the pursuit 
while the capital gains tax he wanted is out of the bidding the 
higher income tax rate he vehemently opposes is not house 
democratic taxwriters are pushing a top rate of33 percent to 
apply to all upperincome taxpayers 
quayle says the administration is violently opposed bush would 
be almost certain to veto a budget that included the upperincome 
tax boost 
the democrats are using the tax dispute in an attempt to depict 
republicans as the party of the rich rep dan rostenkowski 
dill chairman of the ways and means committee said he wouldnt 
deny that they are trying to make a political statement by pushing 
the tax rate increase in the house 
the senate finance committee wants to raise taxes without 
changing the top overall tax rate by limiting itemized deductions 
for upperincome americans sen lloyd bentsen dtexas called it 
a back door route to the same outcome 
nevertheless the white house is willing to swallow a settlement 
on those lines increasing income taxes so long as there is no 
increase in the rate 
but conservative republicans would rather fight than switch to 
any tax increases so would gop candidates who took the hard bush 
line against new taxes early in the campaign and have seen that 
issue undercut 
as he campaigns bush is telling republicans they need to stand 
firm for the best budget possible 
the trouble is that gop factions disagree with each other as 
well as with democrats on what that is

to paraphrase mark twain as bart simpson 
might do it the reports of fox broadcas are 
greatly exaggerated man 
especially from foxs perspective little more than three weeks 
into the fall season the 4yearold netwoting cos deathrk is suffering 
the 
bitter taste of prolonged bad press its executives are feeling 
persecuted 
welcome to the big leagues boys 
for those who just landed from another planet fox took the 
simpsons its overnight runaway sensation and slammed it right 
in the face of nbcs toprated longbeloved the cosby show 
in short david walked right up to goliath and unleashed his 
slingshot then he thumbed his nose 
goliath has not fallen 
since moving to thursdays at 8 pm reruns of foxs animated 
bugeyed simpsons had been trounced by original cosby 
episodes but in its fall premiere last thursday the simpsons 
lost by only onetenth of a ratings point 
fox was gleeful ab spy chief zvi 
zamir and is only empowered to make recommendations 
foreign minister david levy said israels stand against the 
united nations could strain ties with the united states the 
situation now is difficult one mustnt take it lightly 
the cabinets response gave vent to israels frustration at 
coming under strong criticism at a time when civilians are being 
issued gas masks to cope with iraqs threats to attack with 
chemical weapons the army started handing out the defense kits 
last week in three towns and planned to widen distribution to all 
cities including arab villages beginning today 
the temple mount clash was the bloodiest of a 34month 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of lands seized in 
the 1967 middle east war moslems revere the site as the place 
where the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven 
it is the jews holiest site and the location of the western 
wall or wailing wall remnant of their biblical temple 
the temple mount shootings have shifted the focus of the 
palestinian uprising from the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 
jerusalem home to 350000 jews and 150000 palestinian arabs 
on sunday night the israeli government announced plans for a 
building campaign throughout jerusalem to dramatize its claims to 
the city 
the committee on immigration decided to build about 5000 
apartments in the coming year and to ask the cabinet to approve 
incentives to contractors and soviet immigrants said absorption 
ministry spokeswoman ida benshitreet 
mrs benshitreet said housing would go up in eight 
neighborhoods six of them in predominantly arab east jerusalem 
which israel captured in 1967 and later annexed 
the decision comes despite us requirements that israel avoid 
settling soviet newcomers in occupied territories or east 
jerusalem these were conditions of a 400 million loan guarantee 
approved by congress this month

among the lessons emerging from the federal 
budget merrygoround is that leadership in america is in trouble 
your nextdoor neighbor might tell you that it began long before 
this but the inability of political leaders to reach an 
understanding on so basic an issue as the budget has showcased the 
problem 
after a year of economic stagnation and big debts and rising 
unemployment in recent months most american households have had to 
cut deeply and painfully into their budgets they had no choice but 
to do so 
business and charities too have been cutting in some companies 
the efficiency measures have been as drastic as any ever taken 
before but they had no choice in the matter cutting was a matter 
of survival 
washingtons inability to reach an agreement therefore stands in 
contrast to the personal experience of millions of people and it 
leaves them asking who and what they can rely on if not 
themselves 
moreover the new budget will mean higher taxes which most 
people will see as no solution households and businesses were 
denied that course workers cannot order higher paychecks and 
businesses cannot raise revenues at will 
the tax increase also comes at what could be an inappropriate 
time when sales are off the credit structure ailing job security 
tenuous and confidence at some of the lowest ratings since the 
early 1980s 
moreover few can forget those higher taxes are arriving on the 
scene after the public was assured for months that the line would 
be held 
the giants of american business probably did little to inspire 
confidence either announcing last week that the economy would 
weaken and probably fall into recession after saying earlier that 
there wouldnt be a recession 
even the impersonal government statistics have done their bit to 
erode confidence earlier this year the official economic numbers 
indicated a moderately active economy but those figures later were 
revised downward 
while it is unlikely further official revisions in the future 
could show that the economy was indeed in recession in the late 
summer and fall of 1990 but that it was not known to the 
recordkeepers 
meanwhile the federal reserve whose commitment is to orderly 
monetary policy seemingly remains aloof from the battle of the 
pocketbooks declining to lower interest rates until congress 
reaches agreement on a budget 
but here too there are doubts about the feds power how can 
the fed cut interest rates if inflation is rising what power does 
it have over inflation from high energy prices when those prices 
are determined abroad 
wall street too has inspired little confidence with some of 
the same people who forecast a strong market last spring now 
somewhat tardily telling their customers that a bear market lies 
ahead 
it is probably a significant commentary about socalled experts 
leaders authorities forecasters and the like as well as an 
indication of the times that a contrarian view of things can gain 
the confidence of people 
in the stock market and perhaps in the larger world of economics 
and finance the contrarian view holds that if so many are 
expecting bad times it is worth studying the possibility that 
better times might lie ahead

editors note as the world was edging toward another world 
war they worked feverishly trying to decipher coded messages the 
japanese were sending from embassy to embassy and warship to 
warship and long before the first bomb fell they cracked the code 
the japanese thought was unbreakable and learned that war was 
imminent because of bureaucratic bungling by the intelligence 
agencies they didnt learn where it would start

fifty years ago and more than a year before pearl harbor 
americans scored one of their most brilliant victories of world war 
ii 
the commander was a russian immigrant and sometime geneticist 
named william frederick friedman the nature of the battle might be 
suggested by friedmans intense interest once in the 50000word 
novel gadsby which ernest vincent wrigh wrote without using 
the letter e friedmans troops were a motley assemblage of 
academics math wizards and puzzle freaks with a lefthanded 
assist from william shakespeare 
together after 18 baffling months of deadend days and 
floorwalking nights that temporarily collapsed friedman into a 
mental ward they broke the japanese diplomatic code 
their collective genius did not foil of course the sneak 
japanese attack on pearl harbor that brought the united states 
actively into the war crossed and sometimes disconnected wires in 
american intelligence enabled that but codebreaking by friedman 
et al laid the groundwork for the pivotal victory of the us 
fleet at midway in june 1942 indeed codebreaking was an essential 
ingredient of the allies ultimate triumph 
let us begin the tale with john quincy adams as secretary of 
state 18171825 he hired the first us code clerk codebreaking 
andor making was not a pressing concern at the state department 
for years not even when herbert o yardley 24 signed on as a 
1750aweek code clerk in 1913 
yardley had been an indifferent student back in indiana but had 
a flair for math today he would have become a computer hacker 
back then he was a morse code hacker and at state bored so 
bored he began cracking incoming code traffic he deciphered a 
message to president woodrow wilson from his top aide col edward 
m house in but two hours he joined army intelligence in world 
war i as a lieutenant and cryptographer 
the army had another such lieutenant friedman he had been born 
near odessa in 1891 was brought to america by his postal worker 
father to escape antijewish rioting and eventually graduated from 
cornell university as a geneticist 
as friedman was settling into a postgraduate career of fruit 
flies and mendelian imperatives a letter arrived at cornell it 
came from col honorary george fabyan a wealthy cotton broker 
and worldclass eccentric who was looking for a wouldbeer not 
an asiser geneticist to help improve the flora and fauna on the 
farm at his riverbank laboratories outside chicago 
the colonel who kept a pet gorilla and drove about in a 
carriage drawn by two zebras had another nonmammalian passion 
to prove that sir francis bacon and not shakespeare wrote 
shakespeare he had only to decipher the code he believed sir 
francis had encrypted in troilus and cressida etc to prove 
bacons authorship and thereafter bask in the worlds acclaim his 
codebreaker was a similarly convinced proper bostonian mrs 
elizabeth wells gallup she in turn hired an assistant elizebeth 
her mother spelled it without an a so no one would call her 
daughter eliza smith 
when friedman arrived at riverbank in 1915 he brought with him 
an interest in photography mrs gallup asked him to photograph 
some shakespeare folios he thereupon became fascinated with a 
miss smith and b cryptanalysis a word he coined and married both 
for life 
when it came to cryptology something in me found an outlet 
he was to say just an inherent curiosity to know what people 
were trying to write that they didnt want other people to read 
while sir franciss hidden messages kept eluding mrs gallup 
the army began sending cryptograms and coded messages to riverbank 
for deciphering friedman broke one keyed from a book without 
even knowing what the book was impressed the army enlisted him 
into its primitive code apparatus when world war i broke out 
after the war friedman convinced that fabyan was rather an 
oddball nonetheless reluctantly returned to riverbank the army 
sent out a ciphered message it considered absolutely 
undecipherable freidman cracked it and sent back a letter to 
washington in the same cipher the army hired him in 1921 to work 
up its codes mrs friedman eventually worked for the coast guard 
cracking codes of prohibition rumrunners and friedman wrote some 
seminal works on cryptology 
yardley meanwhile had been set up in secret in midtown 
manhattan with army and state department slush funds to run a 
codebreaking operation he called the black chamber his first coup 
was to crack the codes the japanese delegation was using at the 
1921 washington naval conference to limit construction of capital 
ships 
not to be outdone the navy in 1924 appointed lt laurence f 
safford to head a new research desk in the code and signal section 
in the finest tradition of interservice rivalry saffords unit in 
room 2646 of the navy building never communicated what it was doing 
to the army building next door on constitution avenue in 
washington lack of communication among communications spies was to 
remain a problem all along the road to pearl harbor 
it did slowly change however in the face of a technological 
revolution radio 
radio direction finding pinpointing the source and 
destinations of coded messages through triangulation by 
eavesdropping receivers had entered the arsenal of modern 
warfare 
in 1925 the navy began installing radio monitors at guam the 
philippines and shanghai two years later the us cruiser 
marblehead porcupined with antennae shadowed the japanese fleet 
maneuvers 
less visible sailors with civilian safecrackers stole code books 
from japanese consulates even in washington where the partyloving 
naval attache lt cmdr kiyoshi hasegawa dallied with a lady 
agent while his safe was rifled the results were deciphered with 
the assistance of dr and mrs emerson j haworth he a former 
quaker missionary and professor at tokyo university 
codebreaking had become an intense activity so much so that 
yardleys black chamber had broken the codes of 19 nations by the 
time henry l stimson became herbert hoovers secretary of state in 
1928 by then state was financing yardley exclusively stimson a 
jewel in the high hat of the old school was aghast a dedicated 
peacemaker he said the way to make men trustworthy is to trust 
them

even though japanese militarists were already clashing with 
chiang kaisheks soldiers in china and were murdering dovish 
ministers at home stimson closed down the black chamber with one 
of the most famous quotes in all cryptography gentlemen do not 
read each others mail 
in reaction the army created a new signal intelligence service 
under friedman who by oversight never got a security clearance 
with a staff of six to prepare codes locate enemy radio stations 
and break ciphers and friedman began talking with safford 
for his part an angry yardley told all in a 1931 bestseller 
americas black chamber his book was his last greatest and 
wholly unintended gift to american cryptology it persuaded the 
japanese to start using encrypting machines 
these were nothing new thomas jefferson who else had 
invented one his had wheels which turned in a sequence so that 
a for instance went in one end and came out z at the other 
the key to deciphering was to find the key to the encipherment the 
system used to turn the wheels introducing electricity over a 
century later meant the wheels could turn infinitely faster 
producing millions of possible combinations 
yet a basic of decipherment remained the frequency letters 
appear in a given language the letter e is the most common in 
english hence friedmans absorption with nn eless novel 
an electrical enciphering machine named enigma was sold for 
commercial users in germany after the first war in 1927 the army 
signal corps bought one for 144 it became the nazis achilles 
heel throughout world war ii they complacently believed enigma 
unbreakable but the british with the help of some briliant poles 
cracked it giving the allies a fateful advantage 
the japanese had the same confidence in 97shiki obun injiki 
alphabetical typewriter 97 the americans called the machine purple 
after a color in the spectrum they had already broken a japanese 
machine they called red 
the navy had cracked red with the help of an accommodating woman 
provided by the office of naval intelligence who tarried in bed 
with lt toshikazu ohmae while agents rifled his briefcase then a 
much more sophisticated machine purple began to be intercepted by 
the navys listening radios 
capt jinsaburo ito of the japanese navy had developed no 97 
let america and britain solve this cipher if they can he said 
friedmans staff of 19 codebreakers was given the challenge 
codebreakers to say the least do not come in tidy packages 
winston churchill was to say of the grab bag of geniuses who 
cracked enigma i told you to leave no stone unturned in your 
recruiting i did not expect you to take me so literally 
americas cryptographers included stamp collectors chess 
masters a naval officer who accepted a tennis date knowing nothing 
of the game but learned it overnight from a book mrs agnes meyer 
driscoll who was a devotee of cryptic puzzles and taught many the 
tricks of the trade and friedman a golfing family man with an 
alert kindly face who could see patterns where others saw only 
chaos 
the small parochial world of cryptography of the 1930s 
exchanged enciphered christmas cards held roundrobin restaurant 
parties at which guests had to solve a cryptogram at the appetizer 
eatery to tell them where to go for the fish course purple in a 
world edging toward war was something else 
purple was for use only in the major japanese embassies on feb 
18 1939 tokyo signalled these outposts purple was going on line 
it made the fatal error of sending parallel messages on the red 
machine to lesser consulates comparing the two friedmans crew 
decrypted 25 percent of the cipher in a few weeks thereafter a 
brick wall 
little steps nonetheless could be taken the japanese a 
formal people stick to proper and unvarying ways of address 
diplomatic messages encoded could be compared with the same 
messages when delivered to american diplomats in translation if 
they were the same messages messages sent in red were compared 
with purple intercepts made about the same time 
night after night mrs friedman who could not be told why 
could hear her husband pacing back and forth in their kitchen 
naturally this was a collaborative cooperative effort 
friedman later said no one person was responsible for the 
solution 
there were saffords people who kept up a steady flow of radio 
intercepts japanese diplomacy sometimes came via american 
commercial cable companies instead of by radio rights to privacy 
notwithstanding cable managers would pass on copies and times of 
transmission but the scrupulous cable managers in honolulu did 
not give the fbi copies of japanese messages some of which were 
pearl harbor spy reports until a week before the attack 
then sometime in august 1940 harry laurence clark one of 
friedmans young cryptographers had an insight that came to him in 
the night he came to work the next day ecstatic 
i wonder if the monkeys did it that way he is quoted by 
friedmans biographer ronald clark that way was to use 
telephone stepping switches in the purple machine not electric 
wheels 
friedmans crew began scrounging switches from telephone 
companies even fiveanddime stores by guess and by god and by 
genius and by inspired calculation they began piecing together a 
copy of the machine none of them had ever seen or ever would see 
and which was talking in a language few of them knew 
it buzzed and sparked and wasnt lovely but on sept 25 1940 
americas purple machine decoded its first full message 
washington again could read tokyos hand 
as the japanese empire inexorably collapsed in on itself in 
flames purple machines were smashed into bits as embassies closed 
garrisons surrendered or more often fought to the last man one 
machine partially intact was captured on guam of its hundreds of 
wired connections only two were different from the sightunseen 
purple machines of william f friedman and his crew 
even after the war was over the japanese refused to believe 
what the americans had done no they said they must have stolen a 
purple machine somewhere 
they had out of the air

at first we couldnt identify it says monroe water plant 
superintendent wilfred lepage a couple months later biologists 
told us you have zebra mussels and you may never be rid of them 
again 
that was in january 1989 last december a colony of zebra 
mussels and ice clogged monroes only water intake from lake erie 
cutting the flow to a trickle businesses and schools were closed 
hospital surgeries were postponed and the city went to a local 
river and nearby toledo for water during the twoday emergency 
we went through hell lepage says 
the event earned monroe a reputation as the pearl harbor of the

electric utilities along lake erie are stepping up their 
inspections of water intakes for coalburning and nuclear power 
plants detroit edison estimates it will spend 500000 next year 
for a zebra mussel control program at its monroe coalburning 
plant 
the coming of the zebra mussel has ramifications beyond just 
water plants scientists worry that they will alter the aquatic 
food chain that molluskborne toxins will end up in sport fish and 
waterfowl and that zebra mussels will disturb fishspawning 
grounds and clog water intakes critical for farm irrigation 
the mussels also cling to boat hulls and boat engines and their 
shells can slice the feet of beachgoers they are the great lakes 
version of the leafeating gypsy moth caterpillar or the 
africanized killer bee 
the zebra mussel is likely to spread much more quickly than 
the gypsy moth says richard moll assistant director of the 
michigan sea grant program i would imagine in a couple decades 
theyll be found throughout the us 
like the gypsy moth the zebra mussel was inadvertently imported 
into the united states from europe probably aboard a freighter it 
is one of about 115 foreign species that have been introduced into 
the great lakes by man intentionally and unintentionally 
according to ed mills a senior research scientist with cornell 
university in ithaca new york 
the zebra mussel is believed to have entered the great lakes 
area when the freighter of uncertain flag emptied its ballast water 
into lake st clair in 1985 or 1986 it has been sighted in each of 
the great lakes and is moving to inland waterways by hitchhiking on 
boats boat trailers bait pails and even waterfowl 
it conceivably can live in waters throughout the temperate 
region of the united states which includes about 60 percent of the 
country and southern canada in new york state the zebra mussel 
is moving eastward from buffalo along the erie canal the finger 
lakes arent far behind 
theyll be colonized fairly soon says robert lange a 
biologist with the new york department of environmental 
conservation they are working through the erie canal east so 
far theyve reached rochester and eventually theyll reach the 
hudson 
the mississippi river is expected to be colonized by great lakes 
mussels entering either in minnesota or through the illinois river 
near st louis

lake erie has the greatest infestation but scientists hold out 
hope that the other great lakes will experience only small 
invasions because they dont have the rocky bottom structure lake 
erie has 
the zebra mussel is so dangerous because it can reproduce so 
quickly a fully mature female can produce more than 30000 eggs 
per season the eggs are fertilized outside the shell and hatch 
into freeswimming larvae called veligers 
the veligers can remain suspended in the water for one to three 
weeks allowing currents to scatter them if they dont settle on 
firm objects in that time period they die those that find a hard 
surface attach to it with extremely strong tentaclelike threads 
the zebra mussel is mature at one year and can live to about 4 
years old and grow to about 1 inches long 
the older they get the tougher they are to remove says 
gerry mackie a researcher at the university of guelph in ontario 
nothing or very few things can pry it off the rock that makes it 
tough for predators 
and the zebra mussel has few natural predators outside of the 
diving duck and sheepshead fish 
the zebra mussel has flourished in lake erie where it filters 
plankton from the water an adult can filter about a quart of water 
per day and thats what concerns scientists about the impact on 
the food chain 
the current situation is the plankton is out in the open 
water mills says with the zebra mussel which settles on the 
bottom they will be removing particles from the open water more 
of this food is going to be channeled to the bottom getting this 
food to a salmon is going to be less efficient 
researchers say its too early to tell how the zeb mussel will 
affect sport fishing they say there could be an increase in mussel 
predators such as the bottomfeeding sheepshead but its unknown 
how they will affect more soughtafter fish in the great lakes 
such as walleye and lake trout 
mackie says however there are some positive aspects to the 
zebra mussel invasion the zebra mussels filtering ability is 
making lake erie clearer 
ive never seen lake erie look so nice as it has lepage 
says ive seen the bottom of the lake in places that ive never 
seen before 
in the netherlands and soviet union researchers put the zebra 
mussels filtering ability to use in clarifying lakes they also 
use it as a biological monitor to detect what chemicals are in the 
water 
in the united states and canada a new industry has sprouted 
around the zebra mussel dow chemical company in midland mich 
and many others are developing antifouling boat coatings to keep 
zebra mussels from attaching the king co in holland mich has 
developed a bulletshaped squeegee to scrape and remove zebra 
mussels from water intake pipes 
researchers from around the country are watching congress to see 
whether it appropriates 375 million for research and control of 
the zebra mussel others are refining methods to control the pest 
most of those solutions are based on chlorine which is fatal to 
the zebra mussel its been used for the past 200 years in the 
mollusks native europe 
in monroe a chlorine spray jet has been installed at the mouth 
of the water intake to treat the water as it enters the pipe 
so far we are keeping them down lepage says our intake 
is as clean as a whistle 
monroe used the king cos squeegee to clean its intake pipe 
after last years invasion the hightech rotorooter removed enough 
mussels to fill six dump trucks it cost the city 250000 to get 
the system back to premussel operating levels 
the water plant sends divers down regularly to inspect the 
intake for zebra mussel buildup the city also is building a second 
water intake designed to prevent another zebra mussel takeover the 
modifications will cost the city an extra 2 million lepage says 
to control the zebra mussel great lakes researchers are trying 
to learn all they can about the mussels habits its reproduction 
its predators and parasites and its favorite nesting spots 
at a recent meeting of zebra mussel experts from around the 
world in saginaw mich some said the best approach may be to find 
ways to control and even anticipate all introduced species not 
just the zebra mussel other species recently introduced in the 
great lakes are upsetting the food chain they include the spiny 
water flea and the ruffe a fish limited mainly to the duluth 
minn area 
the scientists proposed forming a center for the study of 
introduced species possibly to be established at a university in 
the great lakes 
its going to take years of research before we get a 
definitive answer mackie says

a target date of dec 31 1992 was set to finish the task 
about 60 percent of the 282 measures making up the detailed plan 
of action to form the single market have been adopted by community 
agencies although some countries notably italy have been slow to 
put the rules in place 
the pressure to wrap up the showcase program is keen 
if we fail there will be no political union says an 
official of the european commission who requested anonymity no 
one will believe in it anymore 
the executive agency said in a report earlier this year that the 
common market is now at a crucial stage in implementation of 
the program 
this year it said will determine whether or not the 
objectiveswill be attained 
rough spots lie ahead 
controls on individuals at the countries borders must be 
lifted 
the netherlands belgium luxembourg west germany and france 
finally agreed on a plan for removing border checks for travelers 
in an accord designed to be a model for other community nations 
residents will be able to move freely without showing passports 
or identity cards among the five countries by jan 1 1992 
five years ago the countries agreed in principle to open their 
borders by 1990 but after the border between east and west germany 
opened the deal collapsed some of the countries became worried 
about immigrants from eastern europe illegally crossing into their 
territories 
the community also has had little success in evening out the 
varying tax rates among the different nations 
an effort to impose a minimum withholding tax on interest income 
was a dismal failure luxembourg long known for its bank secrecy 
laws and tax breaks was a fierce opponent 
attempts to come up with similar valueadded taxes roughly like 
sales taxes in the united states have met with resistance 
but the community has produced a wealth of new ideas to try to 
achieve its 1992 goal 
some of the rules or proposals 
call for lifting restrictions that bar citizens of one country 
from depositing money into banks in another country 
provide for a team of experts to watch over mergers and 
takeovers of large companies in western europe 
insist that public contracts in telecommunications 
transportation and water and energy be open to competition in all 
member countries companies which in the past had handily gained 
contracts from their local government will not have such an easy 
time in the future 
set out ways for importing meat products and purebred breeding 
animals into the countries 
press for more competition among airlines in pricing fares and 
setting routes 
ensure that university diplomas issued in one country will be 
recognized in another 
nobody should have any illusions about the reality of the 
single market it will arrive on january 1 1993 indeed it is 
already happening now irish prime minister charles haughey said 
in a recent speech in july haughey turned over to italy the 
communitys rotating presidency 
analysts predict the creation of the single market will give a 
kick to the community economies by increasing competition removing 
red tape getting rid of costly border controls and encouraging 
economies of scale 
that will make the european community not the united states or 
japan the economic strongman of the 1990s some say 
to avoid distracting from the 1992 program the community has 
agreed on a threephase plan to draw the former territory of east 
germany and its 16 million citizens into the trading bloc 
limited exemptions from community rules have been given so the 
backward east german economy can be brought in line with the 
freemarket systems of the west 
west germany will pay most of the bills for improving the 
eastern sector chancellor kohl has promised that unification will 
not drain money from aid programs for the communitys poorer 
countries of ireland spain portugal and greece 
as an added dimension to the 1992 program the common market is 
considering a threestage plan to form an economic and monetary 
union which would eventually lead to a common currency and a 
central banking system modeled after the us federal reserve 
the project has touched off intense debate in britain where mrs 
thatcher has argued against giving up national sovereignty to new 
community institutions 
britains goslow approach recently won backing from other 
nations worried about gloomy economic prospects because of the 
persian gulf crisis which has kicked up oil prices and inflation 
support appears to be growing to delay the quick timetable of jan 
1 1993 for a european central bank dubbed eurofed and a single 
currency 
even so the community intends to go ahead with a special 
conference in rome in december that will open discussions on 
setting up new monetary agencies 
despite deep divisions over some issues the countries still 
appear committed to moving much closer together in the coming 
years 
if they succeed haugheys words could well come true 
it is not unreasonable to say that by 1995 there will be 
an entirely new europe

editors note the new chancellor of the university of 
california at berkeley once a hotbed of student protest is a 
chineseborn engineer who hopes to build some bridges to close the 
gap between science and the humanities between the races 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one of changlin tiens early memories 
of the united states is a pair of segregated water fountains in a 
southern bus station one marked whites only and the other 
labeled colored 
i was very disturbed says the new chancellor of the 
university of californias berkeley campus i didnt know which 
fountain i was supposed to use 
that taste of 1950s racism made a strong impact on tien who was 
born in china as he arrived in kentucky to study at the university 
of louisville 
in his 165000ayear job one of his tasks will be convincing 
fellow asians that admissions policies at the prestigious 
university dont discriminate 
i dont pay attention just to numbers but to interaction 
says tien 55 he says with a slight chinese accent that the 
school needs more staff and faculty from minorities 
but we should be able to understand each other and work 
together he says 
born in central china to a bankers family which fled to taiwan 
after the communist victory on the mainland in 1949 tien studied 
at national taiwan university as well as its military academy an 
engineer by training and a member of taiwans academy of science 
he maintains strong ties to many chinese organizations 
just how strong those ties are was demonstrated when the school 
received a 1 million grant from the government in taiwan with 
tien barely settled in his new office another 1 million grant 
soon came from a chinese charitable group in san francisco 
tien took over as the universitys seventh chancellor on july 1 
university officials point out that other asianamericans have 
been in charge at some us colleges or universities but they were 
smaller institutions that lacked research facilities 
si hayakawa a japaneseamerican took over at san francisco 
state in the 1960s and quelled student rioting he later went on to 
the us senate as the man who as he put it took on spoiled 
brats 
the problems at san francisco state followed similar outbursts 
at berkeley where the free speech movement was born in 1964 
setting off years of tumult at the school the climax came in 1969 
when rioting broke out over a plot of land near the campus 
the 23 acres was marked for student housing but protesters 
wanted to turn it into a peoples park the violence cost one 
life and injured dozens the national guard was called in and 
occupied the city for 17 days 
but thats history 
student jimmy chung recently wrote the san francisco chronicle 
to complain about constantly bringing back the images of the 60s 
to show how the university has changed over the years 
it has been a full generation since the riots and marches and 
those days are but legends to us he wrote our generation 
deserves our own history we are not the ashes of a onceburning 
fire as we have somehow become in the eyes of the media 
university officials stress that tien wasnt chosen because of 
his ethnic background indeed university of california president 
david gardner said when the selection was announced in february 
that tiens academic record his administrative abilities and the 
regard in which he is held not only at berkeley but throughout the 
university of california were the only considerations 
but the fact that he is chinese must be considered a plus 
there have been accusations that the university has racial 
admissions quotas and charges that minority faculty hiring has not 
been aggressive enough 
of the 22000 undergraduates 45 percent are white 28 percent 
asian 13 percent hispanic and 8 percent black with the rest 
coming from other ethnic backgrounds studies have shown that if 
students were admitted strictly on the basis of grades and tests 
nearly 97 percent would be white or asianamerican 
the university now requires students to take courses in either 
black hispanic american indian asian or europeanamerican 
cultures the last course is unusual if not unique it allows for 
example an irishamerican or jewishamerican to study their own 
cultures 
it is these courses that will help all to feel comfortable by 
understanding each other tien says 
a miniature basketball hoop stands near tiens desk with a sign 
written in chinese that freely translated says go bears 
the schools athletic teams are nicknamed the golden bears 
i used to play guard on the varsity at the university and 
academy in taiwan tien says i was short but fast 
tien also is the first engineer to head the berkeley campus and 
he feels that background will help him in his new job 
im a mechanical engineer not a civil engineer but i plan to 
build a lot of bridges he says 
the bridges are figurative but tien hopes they will span the 
gap between science and the humanities and bring the races closer 
together 
tien says his engineering background makes him a little more 
systematically organized 
i do a lot of background work and make a quick clearcut 
decision after all the facts are in said tien an authority in 
thermal radiation who for seven years chaired berkeleys department 
of mechanical engineering 
the chancellor who plans to keep his hand in teaching is 
taking part this fall in a new freshman class called the physical 
world 
we want to introduce students in the social sciences and 
humanities to the newer developments in science and technology 
he says people in all fields have to have knowledge of 
technology just look what the computer has done 
tien long an american citizen sees a greater role for the 
school in world affairs 
we need to expand our vision of the international scene he 
says pointing out that berkeley now offers international and area 
studies 
the new courses will provide a tremendous opportunity to 
increase our knowledge of the pacific rim europe and the soviet 
union among other areas he says 
the new organization which includes the existing institute of 
international studies is designed to integrate an international 
perspective into the curriculum for both graduate and 
undergraduates according to university publications 
berkeley is not a local university tien once said it is 
a national university it is an international university 
sometimes we are embedded so much in the local relationship 
we have forgotten we have a responsibility to the whole world in 
terms of leading institutions in public education

editors note the neighboring towns of palomas mexico and 
columbus nm have been smugglers havens for years authorities 
say with rival families battling for control of the drug traffic 
that rivalry often has been bloody 
</TEXT>

everyone in this border town knows who 
the drug smugglers are but they dont want to talk about it 
i dont want to end up like that other guy says a palomas 
businessman insisting on anonymity 
that other guy was jose pepe armendariz 37 a local 
businessman who was dragged from a palomas bar in march 1989 and 
shot once in the back of the head his body was found in the local 
cemetery a little more than a year ago townspeople and us law 
enforcement officers say the killing was drugrelated but official 
details are scarce 
jose miller hermosillo attorney general for the northern mexico 
state of chihuahua says the case remains under investigation 
the dead mans father jose armendariz says his son had been 
friends with drug smugglers since childhood but was not involved 
i think he knew something he knew everybody around here and 
what they did armendariz says 
several people have been killed here in the past two years in 
disputes involving drugconnected families residents and us law 
officers say 
pepe paid the price for being too friendly with one side or 
the other says carlos ogden attorney and exmayor of 
neighboring columbus nm 
retired us border patrol agent don daniels says one faction 
finally forced the other out of palomas a town of about 8000 
people and six or seven people were killed 
they had a little miniwar daniels says 
michael lappe agent in charge of customs at el paso texas 
says the power struggle followed the death three years ago of 
longtime mexican drug kingpin pablo acosta mexican federal police 
killed acosta in a shootout at a ranch near ojinaga 200 miles 
south of el paso 
lappe says the sandovals of palomas were among families emerging 
in the vacuum created by acostas death 
brothers carlos and fabian sandoval are under us indictment on 
heroinsmuggling charges dating from 1983 us attorney william 
lutz of albuquerque nm said they were fugitives for seven years 
after each putting up 2500 of their respective 25000 bonds 
weve always thought they were down in the palomas area 
lutz says 
carlos sandoval remains at large but fabian sandoval was 
arrested in early september following a shootout near here said 
federal judicial police cmdr elias ramirez 
ramirez said sandoval attempted to bribe officers with 500000 
in us currency 
sandoval and five men arrested with him are members of a family 
linked to drug trafficking and murder ramirez said at a ciudad 
juarez news conference 
the federales seized much of the sandoval family property 
including a lumberyard in palomas said tracy self police chief in 
neighboring columbus nm 
the family also owned landing strips warehouses and ranches and 
employed more than 100 gunmen throughout chihuahua state ramirez 
said 
many emerging mexican drug organizations have connections to 
colombian cocaine cartels several us law enforcement officials 
say colombian cocaine has been routinely flown into chihuahua 
state for years they say 
but the administration of president carlos salinas de gortari 
has been cracking down for the past two years self says there is a 
tough new federal commandant in palomas 
there used to be an airport west of palomas where colombian 
cocaine was flown in but the binational crackdown including a 
nearby antismuggling radar blimp on the us side forced the 
landings farther into mexicos interior the officials say now 
they say smugglers truck the contraband to the border and stash it 
in the desolate rangeland along the 180 miles of rusty barbedwire 
fence new mexico shares with mexico

what the colombians are doing is aligning themselves with 
established mexican drug traffickers because they have all the 
established routes in place all their arrangements taken care 
of says sam herrera resident drug enforcement administration 
agent in charge at el paso 
self says informants in mexico tell him colombians have been 
buying property around casas grandes 120 miles south of here and in 
the las chepas area a few miles south of the border 18 miles west 
of here 
theyre forcing people out and buying officials the way it 
was described to me they were telling these people we can buy it 
from you or we can buy it from your widow 
palomas and las chepas are ideally located for smuggling in a 
sparsely populated triangle of mexico between new mexicos 
eastwest and northsouth borders 
palomas and columbus have been smugglers havens for 
generations 
we have families in palomas and columbus that are second and 
thirdgeneration smugglers self says 
he says theyre nearly impossible to infiltrate because theyre 
so closeknit 
you can hire 50 kids in palomas for 50 bucks apiece to haul 50 
pounds of marijuana across the line its virtually impossible 
to stop them all he says 
during a shootout with state judicial police a few weeks ago at 
las chepas one youth captured by officers told them they were 
lucky his gun jammed or they would never have taken him alive 
self says several other youths escaped 
self says he fears an allout drug war may be brewing between 
rival families he says his own life has been threatened many times 
by local smugglers he carries a submachine gun 
he provided a list of 13 known palomas drug smugglers and 40 
weapons they have bought from one legitimate us gun shop since 
1986 the weapons include several semiautomatic weapons the men 
all listed new mexico post office boxes 
they get the post office box and drivers license and with 
that they can go into any gun store in new mexico he says 
self says children of wealthy palomas drug families attend 
school in columbus the children are usborn and therefore 
citizens 
about 75 percent of our 310 students come across from 
palomas school secretary irene davis acknowledges 
in school customs and border patrol officers give antidrug 
lectures but mrs davis says students see the issue from 
conflicting perspectives how do children of drug families just 
say no 
the smaller ones dont really understand what it is thats 
going on but the older ones do it kind of gives them double 
standards says mrs davis 43 a lifelong columbus resident 
the palomas businessman says he also worries about the lure of 
easy money on children he says his teenage son suggested last 
summer he might join the smugglers 
dad but they make a lot of money he says the youth told 
him 
the father threatened to throw his son out of the house 
the father already had been asked to carry a package across the 
border for hundreds of dollars he said 
im honest i said no i said when i sit down and eat a pot 
of beans im going to eat them without having to look over my 
shoulder to see whos going to shoot me in the back and when i go 
to sleep i dont sleep with a gun under my bed and i dont walk 
around with four or five bodyguards like you guys do 
these guys have to go out in the street every day and they 
know somebodys going to knock them off one of these days 
i could have become a millionaire he adds but im not 
going to live like that 
like this guy that got killed he said i have so much money 
im not going to be able to spend it the rest of my life he sure 
didnt he didnt get to spend it

editors note wild animals are being returned to their former 
habitats in new yorks adirondack mountains and elsewhere across 
the country but not all are being welcomed back docile moose are 
fine and small cats are ok some residents say but who wants 
wolves and cougars roaming around their back yard 
</TEXT>

dozens of canada lynx shipped from the 
yukon are digging their claws into the high peaks of new yorks 
adirondack mountains in one of the nations newest wildlife 
restoration projects 
in addition female moose could be moved to the adirondacks as 
early as next year to keep company with a lonely herd of males 
some nature lovers want to bring back wolves and cougars but 
some residents say thats going too far 
one advocate of wolves and cougars is neil woodworth lobbyist 
for the adirondack mountain club 
youre never going to see them youre never going to be 
threatened by them but youre going to hear them at night he 
says its the very essence of the wilderness the kind of 
experience youll treasure a lifetime 
while many people are afraid of wolves and cougars the less 
dangerous lynx and docile moose are welcomed by conservationists 
and adirondack residents alike 
fifty lynx have been released since last year around newcomb in 
essex county about 100 miles north of albany says biologist 
rainer brocke who heads the program about 40 more will be 
released next year 
canada lynx are sleek cats with long fur and tufted ears 
weighing from 18 to 35 pounds the cats live in forests and 
lumbering wiped them out in the adirondacks in the late 1800s 
the high peaks can sustain about 70 lynx says brocke a 
professor at the state university college of environmental science 
and forestry in syracuse by next year enough lynx will have been 
released to make up for cats lost to road kills disease or even 
poachers he says 
biologist bob lund of the new jersey fish game and wildlife 
division says new york has a tremendous land advantage with the 
adirondacks theyll probably be real successful 
new jerseys efforts to reintroduce the lynxs cousin the 
bobcat in the northern third of the state failed mainly because 
only 24 cats were released from 1977 to 1981 lund says 
human development essentially pushed out and ran over new 
jerseys bobcat population by the 1950s lund says only a few 
bobcat remained and the population has been virtually unchanged 
despite the restoration effort he says 
the lynx may fare better so far six have been killed by cars 
while another raiding a chicken coop was shot by a farmer the rest 
are thriving and at least one pair apparently mated last spring 
brocke says 
the cats are tracked by radio collars the males have roamed 
areas as large as 700 square miles some lynx have wandered all the 
way to new england and new brunswick brocke says 
they exercise their freedom to roam he says some 
exercise it too much 
the lynx are roaming to pick the areas where theyre 
interested in living and setting up shop says kent gustafson a 
research assistant for the project those released in 1989 are 
settling down he says 
environmental officials hope to release female moose that may 
entice about 20 migratory males wandering the adirondacks to settle 
down as well 
the number there now is not going to get any larger because 
most of them are males brocke says 
the state department of environmental conservation could begin 
releasing moose in the mountains by late next year says peter nye 
who heads the agencys endangered species unit 
while new jerseys bobcat program failed a wild turkey 
restoration had dramatic success a decade ago 23 turkeys were 
released today new jerseys wild turkeys number 5000 and the 
state allows limited hunting of the birds lund says 
in north carolina the us fish and wildlife service has 
reintroduced 22 red wolves in alligator river national wildlife 
refuge since 1987 
the wolves were bred in captivity from only 40 survivors of the 
species those survivors were rounded up in texas and louisiana in 
1973 after congress passed the endangered species act 
i tell people that if the endangered species act had not been 
passed till 1976 there would be no red wolves today says warren 
parker who heads the program 
two litters of red wolf pups were born in the refuge this year 
parker says more wolves will be released in other parts of the 
eastern seaboard next year he said 
contrary to claims made by opponents of such efforts wolves and 
other carnivores are not beasts from hell parker says 
youre not going to have to pull up and move because we put 
wolves in next to you he says theyre not going to chase 
school buses and attack children 
red wolves feed mostly on small mammals and do not hunt in 
packs their cousin the gray wolf does hunt in bands and is 
finding a cooler welcome in the adirondacks and other areas where 
conservationists want them reintroduced 
defenders of wildlife a conservation group in washington dc 
is pushing federal officials to reestablish gray wolves in 
yellowstone national park in wyoming 
a bloody and pointed and governmentsanctioned effort to 
shoot poison and trap the grey wolf off the face of the earth 
has left it all but extinct in the lower 48 states says the 
groups spokeswoman mary margaret patterson 
since the wolf died out in yellowstone around 1920 the park has 
been overrun by elk and bison the wolfs prey patterson says 
the wolf is needed to thin elk and bison herds that are on the 
brink of starvation she says 
ranchers fearful for their livestock oppose bringing back the 
wolf 
adirondack residents dont mind lynx which feed on snowshoe 
hare and other small mammals but only the staunchest of nature 
lovers want large predators such as wolves and cougars living next 
door 
they add an incredible asthetic quality says woodworth of 
the adirondack mountain club 
on the downside wolf packs can wrestle large mammals such as 
moose to the ground 
putting wolves back in the adirondacks would jeopardize the 
states efforts to revive moose brocke says also competition 
from another cousin may leave no room for the gray wolf in the 
adirondacks 
the coyote has taken over the ecological niche of the original 
wolf brocke says we have a miniwolf in the adirondacks 
already 
talk of restoring wolves and cougars to the adirondacks is 
premature since researchers are waiting to see how the lynx fare 
lynx arent a threat to anyone gustafson says if youre 
going to learn how to do something youve got to start small

john shea finally agreed to do a television 
series but not until he had read dozens of pilot scripts in search 
of a strong role 
a veteran new york stage actor who has appeared in several 
films shea is making his tv series debut on cbs in wiou set 
in the highly competitive environment of local television news 
shea stars as hank zaret a newly hired news director battling 
low ratings at a network affiliate station in chicago the role of 
a key man in a tough spot mirrors sheas own apprehension about 
working in tv 
i didnt watch television i didnt like it and i didnt want 
to do a series shea says i felt television could destroy me 
i came out of the new york theater and had elitist attitudes 
but shea an energetic man found that he sometimes spent six 
months doing nothing between plays and movies 
i was getting bored he says i looked for alternatives 
and my agent said a tv series was one way to solve the problem 
after i won an emmy for playing the attorney in baby m the 
networks started pursuing me in earnest i turned down everything 
but decided to educate myself i started reading the pilot scripts 
shea began splitting his time between stage and films when he 
made his movie debut in missing in 1982 since then he has 
appeared in stealing home a new life unsettled land 
and windy city his tv films include the impossible spy 
family reunion small sacrifices kennedy baby m 
and do you know the muffin man 
he compares the theater to sculpture and television to 
watercolors on stage youre constantly chipping away at an image 
to discover and reveal an ideal form which is never achieved he 
says in television like watercolors you have to know what you 
want and do it very quickly 
so i had a jump when wiou came around last winter i read 30 
to 40 scripts to me wiou was clearly the best for many reasons 
i got a lot of scripts for halfhour comedies but i didnt want to 
do a sitcom i wanted a role that would challenge me 
i didnt want to be the sole star of an hour drama ive heard 
too many horror stories of how actors get burned out i wanted to 
do an ensemble show 
now hes working with some of the people who helped refine 
ensemble dramas in the early 1980s with such multiemmy winners as 
hill street blues and st elsewhere 
shea heads a cast in wiou that includes helen shaver as a 
reporter pushing to become an anchorwoman shaver is also the 
former girlfriend of sheas character 
others in the large cast are harris yulin as an anchorman whose 
ego matches his inflated salary mariette hartley as an executive 
producer who feels she should have gotten sheas job and dick van 
patten as a popular weatherman who reaps a fortune for personal 
appearances 
its a volatile mixture of drama and black comedy that goes up 
against nbcs hot police show hunter and abcs lyrical cop 
rock on wednesday 
shea says one of the things that attracted him to wiou was 
its similarity to the only shows he ever watched hill street 
blues and st elsewhere they were also ensemble shows that 
blended drama and comedy and they were developed at mtm when it 
was headed by grant tinker 
tinker went on to become head of nbc when those police and 
hospital dramas slowly developed an audience while charming the 
critics and emmy voters 
wiou is from tinkers gtg entertainment tinker was chairman 
of nbc from 198186 
the creators of wiou john eisendrath and kathryn pratt 
each spent six years in local television news in chicago 
eisendrath was a producer and writer and pratt was a reporter 
scott brazil coexecutive producer with the creators is a former 
producer of hill street blues 
my character is a man obsessed with details and so am i 
shea says i was involved in the casting im involved in the 
writing im a news junkie and i collect stories i have a masters 
degree in directing from yale and i see this as an opportunity to 
direct again 
hanks a former boy wonder whos taken smaller stations to the 
top i think of him as a news gangster who goes after the story at 
any cost he took a fall in new york when he rushed into a story 
that turned out to be wrong now hes wary everybodys on his 
neck he has to bring up the stations ratings but he has to watch 
his ethics 
shea has leased a house in santa monica and his wife and son 
jake have joined him from new york his wife is laura pettibone a 
finearts photographer whose work is exhibited in galleries around 
the country 
i made my debut in missing which was a prestigious picture 
with jack lemmon and sissy spacek i couldnt find a worthy 
successor i turned down a lot of things went my own way and as a 
result lost my momentum shea says 
i did a lot of art films abroad that no one has ever seen so 
in a way im entering the culture of my country in a big way what 
i havent done before is mainstream work and i thought a 
television series would do that immediately none of my features 
were big commercial successes 
this is a turning point im older now ready for a new phase 
of my life

there are certain songs by george and ira 
gershwin that michael feinstein never ever gets tired of singing 
like they cant take that away from me 
or someone to watch over me 
thats a song every time i do it i feel a different sense of 
how i want to sing it says the brash boyish feinstein 
theres never only one interpretation 
in the last seven years or so feinstein has been singing a lot 
of gershwin and kern and rodgers and porter and styne and all 
those other great broadway and hollywood composers he admires with 
the enthusiasm of a true believer 
and his devotion has paid off 
since 1983 feinstein has gone from tiny hotel clubs in los 
angeles to the fabled algonquin in new york from concert dates all 
across the country to various symphony orchestras and to broadway 
three times in two years 
the performing and pressure have been almost nonstop 
i do work a lot the 34yearold feinstein said the other 
day while preparing for his latest foray on broadway michael 
feinstein in concert piano and voice one thing that happens 
when you first achieve success is that you get jobs and think wow 
great this is what i wanted my whole life you take everything 
seven records and hundreds of concerts later he says its time 
to slow down after being on the road for as much as seven months 
each year 
i got to a point where finally i had to say no im not 
going to do this its hard to say no im a real people pleaser 
now im really starting to say no because there has to be a balance 
in everything particularly in work and play and im going to take 
a good deal of time off next year 
besides his house in california feinstein now has a second home 
in santa fe nm although he hasnt been there as often as he 
would like 
i have unblocked a lot of my life for 1991 he says i 
just need time to myself people hire you because they think youre 
good or they love what you do but you have to have time to be 
creative you have to have time to lie on a beach and read to do 
other things i want to take time to learn how to use computers and 
synthesizers 
although he loves new york feinstein cant unwind in the big 
apple 
thats why ive never lived here he says but i meditate 
and exercise and that keeps me sane 
what hasnt bothered him was the change from playing in front of 
50 to 60 people at places like the algonquin to performing before 
2000 in a theater or even 17000 in the hollywood bowl 
when i was first booked into a large place i was nervous 
feinstein says i didnt know whether i would adapt to a larger 
setting 
i learned that i could do the same thing on stage that i could 
do in the algonquin relate to the people tell stories if im 
comfortable on stage and act like im in my living room then the 
audience is going to be comfortable 
feinstein beams when he talks about his latest project a series 
of recordings with famous composers playing their own works 
im like a little kid he laughs i jump up and down 
because its so much fun 
the idea grew out of feinsteins passion for collecting records 
something he has done since he was a child in columbus ohio it 
started with old 78 rpm records of people such as bing crosby and 
fred astaire and blossomed after he obtined home recordings of 
many famous songwriters playing their own compositions 
after feinstein moved to california in 1976 he met a lot of 
them harry warren ira gershwin arthur schwartz burton lane and 
others 
everytime i would hear one of these guys play the piano it was 
a revelation he recalls its like an author reading his own 
work they know what its about it came from their soul 
album one michael feinstein sings the burton lane songbook 
has just been released and lane best known as the composer of 
finians rainbow and on a clear day you can see forever 
made surprise appearances on stage during feinsteins latest 
broadway show 
burton didnt write that many shows for broadway feinstein 
says he was very picky as to what he did but he told me once 
that he felt his songs were ambassadors of good will they had made 
a lot of friends for him 
on tap are a second volume of songs with lane as well as an 
album with jule styne composer of shows such as gypsy funny 
girl and bells are ringing and others such as hugh martin 
harold rome jay livingston morton gould charles strouse and 
jerry herman have expressed interest in working with him

are we weird guitarist chris degarmo of 
queensryche asks only slightly kidding 
no queensryches not weird its just that hearts and flowers 
are not part of their vocabulary when they write of love its 
obsessive and intense such topics as homelessness selfreliance 
the environment and dream control are also more their speed 
and seriousness is their specialty 
critics hailed the seattle bands 1988 magnum opus 
operationmindcrime as heavy metals answer to the whos 
quadrophenia and pink floyds the wall the entire album 
concerned an underground organization that preaches the overthrow 
of government and the cleaningup of a corrupt society 
with their latest effort empire queensryche has left 
behind a record tied together by a central theme and has instead 
turned to individual songs dealing with specific issues the band 
used that formula on their two earlier works 1986s rage for 
order and 1984s the warning 
the first thing that we wanted to do was not repeat 
ourselves degarmo said in a telephone interview 
i think the experimentation that the band is always pushed for 
is what produced operationmindcrime and we felt confident that 
if we continued just really trying to not tread water and push our 
songwriting out into new areas that wed come up with something 
that we all felt really good about and something that was 
interesting as well 
degarmo called empire a more intimate record 
the last record was pretty cynical this third person 
fictional event that the listener just watched more than anything 
or listened to as a spectator he said and this time we just 
felt we needed to make a more personal record that had a lot more 
i language in it 
such songs as della brown about a homeless woman 
resistance about cleaning up the environment and best i 
can a tale of triumph over adversity prove that the band hasnt 
left behind its social consciousness 
della talks about this media message that seems to come to 
young women that if theyve got looks theyve got everything 
degarmo said 
she tries to believe that line and never develops her mind 
never develops the person within and what happens is eventually 
that young beautiful figure and face fades with time and shes 
left unhappy 
perhaps the albums most introspective track is the gorgeously 
orchestrated silent lucidity a haunting song about the fine 
line between dream and reality and the possibility of controlling 
dreams 
degarmo wrote both the music and lyrics of lucidity and said 
it came from his own experiences with lucid dreaming 
the first time i ever experienced a lucid dream it kind of 
really startled me he said i knew that i was dreaming and 
yet i could actively participate in the dream and shape it 
he said the song raises questions about why if one is dreaming 
do situations seem so real 
how come you can go to sleep and enter this rem state where 
youre having sight and sound information coming to your brain and 
you wake up with the experience of what youve done in your dream 
and then you shake it off and go oh no it was only a dream 
but geez it sure felt like i walked through that wall or like 
that i really flew or i had this sexual experience or whatever it 
was that you had thats why people wake up so freaked out out of 
a nightmare it scares them so much because its so real he 
said 
empire also contains some of the bands first love songs 
but theyre more bitter than sentimental filled with longing and 
charged with sexual energy the songs also reflect the bands 
unwillingness to completely lay bare its soul 
you sort of want to reach in and write something about that 
side of you the side of you that is involved in relationships but 
yet you dont want to share that private space of your life with 
everyone so it becomes very tricky to tread that line he said 
with empire queensryche has made still another attempt to 
challenge itself as degarmo said theyre also trying to keep 
the predictability factor low and the goosebump ratio high 
we kind of have this feeling that the audience is really 
into the fact that they never quite know whats going to be on the 
next queensryche release he said and that theyre just 
willing to go along with our experimentation 
i think once they get in they just fall further into the 
abyss until theyre stuck inside our records finding new things 
each time they go through them 
singer geoff tate provides the bands trademark soaring 
operatic vocals and most of its gritty lyrics queensryche holds 
onto an older trend in heavy metal with its two guitarists degarmo 
and michael wilton both of whom share lead and rhythm chores 
relatively equally bassist eddie jackson and drummer scott 
rockenfield round out the band 
degarmo thought that queensryche musically has come a long way 
since its start seven years ago 
from a melodic standpoint i think were trying to make 
songs that are a little stickier i think the lyrics are much more 
concrete now than they were in the past and musically the 
goosebump ratio is getting higher

take 6 has a bit of a public relations 
problem it would like to clear up 
it seems members of this sextet have been berated for lending 
their distinctive a cappella harmonies to an advertisement plugging 
beer 
now take 6 has no philosophical problems with jingles but this 
is a gospel group whose members dont drink dont smoke dont do 
drugs and praise the lord at every turn and they most assuredly 
dont do beer commercials 
a lot of fans who are christians have come to us and said we 
knew youd sell out were disappointed were not going to listen 
to you anymore said mervyn warren but unfortunately its 
just not true 
take 6 recorded a levis commercial that wasnt used television 
themes to the sitcom punky brewster and game show to tell the 
truth and are open to other offers but when budweiser beer 
approached them take 6 said no 
that didnt stop budweiser from carrying through with the idea 
using a group of imitators warren said 
imitation may cause problems but as the saying goes its a 
sincere form of flattery the flap over the commercial is but one 
indication that the selfdescribed contemporary christian a 
cappella pop jazz group has made an impact with a career thats 
just now two albums old 
take 6 formed in 1980 at oakwood college a baptist institution 
in alabama after seven years of singing on the gospel circuit 
under the name alliance they were signed by reprise records in 
nashville 
their first album unexpectedly earned a gold record and three 
grammy awards take 6 quickly became favorites of fellow musicians 
and have performed or recorded with quincy jones johnny mathis 
ella fitzgerald james taylor melba moore and kd lang 
stevie wonder invited the group to open concerts for him in new 
york city bought hundreds of copies of their cd for his friends 
and even used take 6s music on his answering machine message i 
called it myself warren said 
the justreleased second album so much 2 say is a 
combination of the spiritual and secular such songs as time 
after time and sundays on the way speak to take 6s gospel 
audience while i love you and where do the children 
play address more universal concerns 
theres also something new for take 6 musical instruments other 
than their voices 
deep on side 2 of so much 2 say band members joke about the 
a cappella act of 1990 that bans the use of musical 
instruments they immediately follow the gag with where do the 
children play the only song on two take 6 albums with 
instruments 
according to warren the decision to put drums horns and a 
synclavier on the song wasnt unanimous 
when youve got six cooks in the kitchen they all want to 
season the pot a little differently he said im an if it 
aint broke dont fix it type of person i probably would not 
have put instruments on it if it were completely up to me 
warren who produced the album said he was anxious to disprove 
skeptics who thought take 6 couldnt make another successful a 
cappella album 
take 6 will always be an a cappella group at heart he said 
but because we all do play instruments and we listen to all 
different kinds of music inevitably there are going to be some 
novelty pieces and some departures 
warren shrugged off the pressure thats generally crushing on 
groups trying to follow a successful debut 
as is traditional the group had plenty of stored material for 
the first album the follow up was recorded in a year 
the first one was kind of an introduction to the public who 
we are he said the second record we actually sat down and 
conceptualized and wrote this entire record almost from scratch 
where do the children play implores adults to guard children 
against drug abuse these are our children take 6 sings in a 
song written by members david thomas and claude mcknight iii 
dont let them slip away 
the group is doing its part by sponsoring a campaign during this 
falls concert tour they will select six junior high school 
students from six cities get it bring them to concerts and 
enroll them for a stay next summer at the music and arts camp at 
fisk university in nashville 
winners have to show an interest and aptitude in the arts take 
6 will announce winning students during visits to schools along the 
tour 
the group is also doing several benefit concerts for young 
people against crack a poughkeepsie nybased teenage education 
and recreation program designed to help kids resist drugs said 
shauna woods of choice management in nashville 
were trying to do a little something to make the world a 
better place for children warren said 
of all the musicians with whom take 6 has worked since the debut 
abum warren said his favorite was quincy jones 
hes always been the best for me he said ive always had 
his records and i never dreamed that id be able to participate in 
any way on his next record 
take 6s career has taken the sextet beyond the gospel circuit 
this summer the group performed at jazz festivals across the 
country and didnt have to change a note to satisfy finicky jazz 
fans he said 
but whatever style the group tries out warren said take 6 will 
always be a gospel group

you study the yellowed pictures could 
that nowsilent face belong to someone you once knew and those 
funny clogs your greatgrandmother used to wear that kind to work 
as a child and eager for new work the family story goes she 
brought them with her from the old country 
visitors to ellis island may find themselves looking for 
personal pieces of history as they move through the new national 
museum of immigration in the building where their ancestors began 
new lives as americans 
stand in the huge registry room the great hall with its soaring 
vaults lined with thousands of gustavino tiles if they emigrated 
through ellis you can be sure youre standing in the same space 
where your ancestors stood at one time says diana pardue chief 
of the museum services division of the national park service which 
manages ellis island 
ellis you may find is less a sight to see than an experience 
to be shared however vicariously with the ancestors who went 
through it to be admitted to the united states 
not that ellis isnt a handsome sight the 1897 main building 
in the largest restoration ever attempted in the us has been 
brought back from nearruin with 156 million of privately donated 
funds and has drawn critical praise as an architectural treasure 
but perhaps some of the best treasures are the little things 
the recorded histories the homely memorabilia donated by 
individuals the scraps of records postcards photos and posters 
and of course the experience 
land by ferry at the island and enter the building through the 
baggage room where youll see authentic bags boxes and trunks of 
the period most immigrants checked their belongings but others 
distrustful dragged them through the entire clearance procedure 
walk up a flight to the huge registry room where arrivals 
underwent initial scrutiny even as they climbed the steps they 
were scanned by doctors who noted those who had difficulty 
climbing they were asked if they had at least 25 to get 
themselves started and given eye mental and general health checks 
some newcomers received dreaded chalkmarks on their shoulders that 
meant more intensive examination 
go through the wing of smaller examination rooms now the 
through americas gate exhibit connected by hospitaltiled 
corridors here immigrants endured detailed testing and 
commissioners reviewed applications against complex regulations 
while waiting some applicants scratched graffiti or their names 
still to be seen on the walls most were cleared within hours but 
others were kept overnight in dormitories on the third floor 
exit from the registry room down the stairs of separation 
where immigrants departed after processing the left stairs led to 
the ferry back to the manhattan docks and the right for trains to 
westward destinations most went west the center stairs were 
reserved for those who were detained 
the real mission of the museum says pardue is to put this 
experience into context by telling its reasons and showing its 
artifacts 
museum displays trace the great wave of immigration which lasted 
from about 1880 to 1924 the largest human migration in history 
twelve million new americans came to the country through the 
immigration station at ellis island opened in 1892 and perhaps as 
many as 140 million americans today are descendants of these 
immigrants 
most came for economically related reasons overpopulation land 
shortages unemployment and dislocation caused by 
industrialization the earliest came from england ireland germany 
and the scandinavian countries later immigrants came mainly from 
italy russia and austriahungary the early ones wanted land the 
later ones often just wanted jobs 
immigrants came through ellis and about 30 other entry points 
such as brunswick ga el paso texas ketchikan alaska and port 
townsend wash thats why the museum is devoted immigration itself 
and not just to ellis the task of separating the story of ellis 
from the story of immigration was impossible pardue says 
facts are given life by memorabilia rail timetables list 
departures to council bluffs des moines st joseph and kansas 
city via the corn belt route original ship manifests carry 
information that immigration officials relied on for official 
records thus the visitor learns that miss s a snowden 27 of 
bedford england arrived from the port of liverpool to settle 
permanently in new york city she had three pieces of baggage 
voices of immigrants are heard through an archive of recorded 
individual oral histories the park service spent about 10 years 
collecting these searching for subjects by taking out small ads in 
the aarp bulletin and similar publications 
through this search they also found items for the treasures 
from home exhibit after a while pardue says the collection 
sort of grew by itself with one contributor telling another 
these are souvenirs from the worlds left behind linens and 
clothing in elaborate needlework books musical instruments 
sewing machines toys spectacles shoes jewelry and other 
treasures most immigrants arrived with just as much baggage as 
they could manage and what they brought were things they valued 
the extraordinary part is that the people who donated things 
are still alive and theyve been able to tell us about them to 
give us details someone who may have donated a doll could tell us 
how she got it and what it meant 
there are no immigration records at museum though future plans

to a casual visitor china cove on angel 
island state parks northeastern shore is a pleasant sandy beach 
for picknicking and watching boats in san francisco bay 
to others it is ellis island of the west and to many of 
asian ancestry it symbolizes something far less welcoming 
the old immigration station at china cove opened in 1910 
originally was meant to handle an expected flood of immigrants who 
would be coming to the united states by way of the newly opened 
panama canal but it was used instead as a detention center for 
most of the approximately 175000 chinese immigrants who came to 
america between 1910 and 1940 looking for their gan saan or 
golden mountain of wealth which they planned to return to the 
economically depressed villages that sent them 
at any one time between 200 and 300 men and 30 to 50 women were 
detained as they tried to overcome the tangle of restrictive 
antiasian laws some of these were held on the island for weeks 
months or even years awaiting hearings or appeals on their 
applications almost 10 percent of the detainees eventually were 
deported and many of these to avoid the humiliation of being sent 
back to their villages committed suicide 
the detainees often wrote poetry to vent their anger despair 
homesickness and loneliness and some of it was carved on the walls 
in the style of the tang dynasty the rediscovery of the carvings 
in l970 prompted a california state legislature appropriation for 
the preservation of the station which closed after a fire 50 years 
ago 
today visitors can visit the old rooms now brightly painted 
and see fragments of the poetry a 50th anniversary commemoration 
is planned for november and many former detainees will make peace 
with the past says paul chow whose angel island immigration 
station historical advisory committee is planning the event we 
finally made it to gold mountain he says

sobered by two snowscarce seasons european winter resorts are 
luring skiers back to the slopes with massive investments in 
snowmaking machines and substitute activities ranging from winter 
golf and horseback riding to sled dog runs and cooking classes 
europes last two mild winters triggered an arc of crisis 
mainly in the western alps causing resorts to close early or 
drastically curtail their season on the eastern side of europes 
central range however mountains benefited from greater snowfalls 
and held the damage to a 3 percent drop in attendance 
meanwhile highaltitude resorts which boast skiing the 
yearround at over 11550 feet boasted record seasons frances 
glaciers at les deux alpes and alpe dhuez attracted thousands of 
italians over the border while hinterdux and sulden in austria 
became the hotdog places to ski italys 9100foot stelvio 
pass training site for the national team and its boisterous star 
alberto la bomba tomba invested 10 million in new lifts for 
glacier skiing another growing summer as well as winter sport 
for europeans and visitors 
europes oldest resort italys sestrieres reeled out the lure 
as soon as summer ended it is offering a halfprice 636 early 
purchase season ticket for over 100 lifts spread across 250 miles 
of the francoitalian milky way which allows gliding back and 
forth across the border with no passport also included in the 
ticket are free access to health clubs medical insurance and 
helicopter evacuation in case of accident free ski lessons for 
children under 7 free tickets to a race in the world ski 
championship on dec 11 discounts on mountain bike purchases and 
free access to a winter golf driving range 
italys frenchspeaking val daosta area at the foot of 
europes tallest peak mont blanc already has started its drive to 
edge out salt lake city nagano japan ostersund sweden jaca 
spain and sochi ussr for the last winter olympics of the 
century in 1998 the aosta resorts of courmayeur and pila have 
poured 10 million into new snowmaking equipment in 12 valleys and 
started regular helicopter ski runs with mountain guides at powder 
snow time or high on the glaciers crosscountry skiers are a being 
wooed by 5 rental fees while canine fans can try their rein with 
siberian and alaskan huskies and alaskan malamutes at the mont 
blanc sled dog school europes version of the alaskan iditarod 
race called alpirod and starring many of the american drivers from 
the grueling competition starts jan 22 in courmayeur covering 
the entire alpine region in 12 days 
applying the same wandering spirit to restless skiers italys 
spectacular dolomite range with its superski dolomiti skipass 
allowing access to 12 resorts and 450 lifts has started a new 
vacation on the move formula skiers may glide off every 48 
hours to a new town while their suitcases are bused to the next 
hotel on their vacation allowing them to unbuckle at the door of 
their next overnight stay without the hassle of changing location 
our main problem has been to get the correct information on 
the weather to skiers abroad says franz peradoner director of 
the dolomiti formula while skiers might have been sobbing in one 
mountain valley others could have been kicking up powder in 
another place where the snowfall hit its always safer to check 
conditions with a quick telephone call 
swanky swiss resorts seem to have suffered the least from scarce 
snowflakes zermatt recorded a 129 increase in foreign visitors 
also due to its glacier skiing st moritz with less than 50 
percent of the visitors seeking downhill activities has 
diversified into crosscountry winter cricket polo games in the 
snow greyhound racing and horse jumping 
nevertheless the snowdrought did hit the entire european 
industry hard in 1990 frances rossignol and yugoslavias elan ski 
factories posted record losses and salomon bindings reduced their 
sponsorship to 30 world cup skiers apparel companies like benetton 
took advantage of the crisis to buy up equipment producers like 
nordica boots and to start producing new winter clothes lines and 
some environmentalists especially in switzerland are beginning to 
request restrictions in local referendums on artificial snow 
cannons claiming it affects the alpine ecology and the water 
table 
a quick skiaround other areas 
austria saalbach is hosting the world ski championships in 
february and many resorts already are fully booked for the 
christmas and traditional carnival vacations ice skating curling 
winter bicycling and hiking have been planned as nosnow 
contingencies 
switzerland some resorts like wengen a favorite of britains 
prince charles an expert skier and muerren are so popular that 
hotel owners accept reservations from regular clients only in 
alternate years the frenchspeaking valais area has launched a 
lift card useable in the entire province sunny resorts like crans 
montana are offering golfinthesnow and outdoor tennis besides 
hiking 
scandinavia sweden and other scandinavian countries are 
enjoying a miniboom reinforced by a snow guarantee triggering 
a reimbursement in case the flakes do not fall 
france albertville site of the 1994 olympics has been the 
rising star of frances hightech resorts and neighboring val 
disere courchevel and les arcs are proceeding with preparations 
for the world competition 
germany west germanys resorts are offering threehour 
instead of allday lift tickets while garmisch partenkirchen of 
olympic fame has invested in snow cannons to avoid calling off 
world cup ski races for the fourth season in a row 
spain while the central sierra nevada resort coped with tons 
of snow throughout the 1990 season the popular baqueira y beret a 
regular stop for king juan carlos and his royal family was only 
intermittently open but spain has one of the lowest weeklong lift 
tickets in europe less than 100 for six days while the alpine

after suffering an offyear last 
season due to poor snow colorado ski resorts are hoping to lure 
record numbers of skiers with 30 million in lift and lodge 
improvements throughout the state 
the forecast predicts a wet winter this year even the 
farmers almanac is predicting a snowy year said kathleen shaw 
a spokeswoman for colorado ski country usa the industrys lobbying 
group 
the skiing in colorado is as varied as the states geography 
singles and young couples the people who can party all night and 
ski all day flock to the glitz of aspen and vail provided they 
can afford it 
families gravitate to the big resorts too steamboat springs 
has grown to rival the terrain of the betterknown resorts summit 
county with resorts at keystone arapahoe basin breckenridge and 
copper mountain has some good deals with a wide choice of where 
to ski 
others particularly westerners who think anything other than a 
rope tow is a lift of luxury tend to prefer the small places the 
bestkept secrets of colorado skiing provided they can survive the 
rigorous economic competition 
wolf creek pass in southern colorado has snowfalls of 400 
inches a year its unpretentious and never crowded ski sunlight 
near glenwood springs the middleclass answer to the aspen areas 
four resorts doesnt have the highest vertical by any means but 
its uncrowded has varied terrain and its lift tickets come with a 
pass to the hot springs pool 
small areas have it tough monarch between gunnison and salida 
has been through bankruptcy reorganization powderhorn near grand 
junction has so many lawsuits from angry creditors and a water 
shutoff by fedup neighbors that it may not even open this year 
although current company officials say it will 
eldora near boulder is managed now by vail associates as is 
ski broadmoor in colorado springs shaw says the small resorts 
suffer more from high liability insurance rates uncertain power 
bills and lack of skier awareness outside colorado so they have a 
tough time competing with the big ones 
as baby boomers age so is skiing telluride famous for its 
steep narrow bump runs including the famed plunge is grooming 
and widening some of them now 
boomers who skied bumps all day when they were in college ski 
one steep set of bumps a day mostly to prove they can still do it 
what they prefer is wellgroomed advanced intermediate runs and a 
ski schoolday care option for their kids 
at purgatory a previously small resort now coming into its own 
locals buy season passes for 75 visitors get day care lunch and 
a ski lesson for 38 the top adult lift ticket price is 34 
colorado ski country says colorado resorts because of the 
amenities they offer including sleighriding and ice skating 
provide better value for the money than resorts in other states 
like utah or wyoming 
aspen is touchy about its prices earlier this year aspen ski 
co commissioned a study that showed a week of skiing for two 
complete with air fare from chicago and midrange lodging was less 
than a skier would pay at deer valley resort in utah still the 
tab runs 2900 for the twoperson package in aspen food and drink 
not included 
at breckenridge in summit county weeklong packages without air 
fare start at 300 purgatory crested butte and others have a wide 
range of prices 
the rising cost of oil is likely to increase air fares this 
winter although shaw says colorado ski country expects the rising 
costs to have little impact this coming season most travel 
packages have been locked in on contract she says so skiers this 
season wont suffer from higher air fares unless they decide at 
the last minute to go skiing 
outofstate travelers to colorado ski resorts dont have to 
hassle with the winter crush at stapleton international airport in 
denver any more in the last 10 years airports close to major 
resorts have undergone runway and navigation improvements to allow 
jet traffic to land 
skiers going to crested butte for example can fly direct and 
nonstop every day from chicago and dallasfort worth and on 
weekends from atlanta and houston to gunnison only a 30minute 
drive to the resort 
hayden a 20minute drive from steamboat springs has direct 
flights coming from dallas chicago los angeles phoenix 
minneapolis san jose and newark 
choosing a ski resort involves tradeoffs a fast nightlife and 
lots of shopping and restaurants generally mean crowds too 
conversely a smaller area with no crowds means little or no 
nightlife and little shopping 
the time of year is important too christmas in a ski resort is 
an experience valued by many early snowbirds anxious to hit the 
slopes put up with blustery cold and varying snow conditions in 
november and early december january has better snow but it can 
get cold 
during february march and early april the snowpack is deep and 
solid the crowds thin after spring break and its warm enough 
many days to ski in a tshirt and jeans 
travel agents can obtain information on any of colorados 25 ski 
resorts lifts terrain prices lodging amenities and weather

the poets and the travel agents will tell you go to ireland 
theyll wax lyrical about the irish warm and friendly and the 
countryside beautiful and its cheap 
two out of three isnt bad 
two hundred years ago horace walpole wrote that the irish 
have the best hearts in the three kingdoms of great britain 
arguably his opinion still holds 
the country itself the green island the emerald of europe 
appears just made for photographs as well as memories indeed 
several new picture books published this year try to capture the 
people and the dramatic vistas in twodimensional visions an 
irish moment colour library books ireland your only place 
crown irish cottages crown 
no other country is so associated with a color green the irish 
claim their land produces 41 shades of green its now 42 with 
us currency left there by tourists 
which brings us to the third point with the recent us dollar 
devaluation irelands economic entry into the european community 
and the countrys growing reliance on tourism to survive if not 
thrive a visit is no longer the bargain of the past although 
comfortable bedandbreakfasts listed geographically in an irish 
tourist board booklet cost a most reasonable 2030 per person 
on a recent weeklong trip across the country it was decided to 
bypass cosmopolitan dublin and trainferry from london to rosslare 
harbour on irelands southeast coast the train ride across wales 
and the luxury ferry across the irish sea are delightful adventures 
in themselves there are other ferry routes as well depending on 
your plans including one from the coast of france 
ten minutes into the country provided the first of many examples 
of the friendliness and hospitality of the irish when car rental 
arrangements and accommodations went awry on arrival a local lass 
working for a competitor rental agency offered her home as a 
bedandbreakfast for the night and went out of her way to take us 
to and from dinner waking early to fetch our car and bring it to 
us 
from there armed with the advice of a leprechaun travel agent 
and a good map it was off to see the country constantly 
reminding ourselves to drive on the left a small car is a 
necessity incidentally if your plans are to take the narrower 
side roads the ones the irish now call regionals as compared 
to the national highways 
from rosslare it was on to wexford waterford yes the crystal 
palace dungarvan with its celtic sea coast vistas cork the 
countrys second largest city and just north blarney not a long 
way from tipperary 
the 15thcentury blarney castle lures tourists with the legend 
of its blarney stone the promise of everlasting eloquence to those 
who kiss it according to the story recorded in verse centuries 
ago 
there is a stone there 
that whoever kisses 
oh he never misses 
to grow eloquent 
others obviously not irish say kissing the stone assures 
telling lies for seven years 
getting to the stone takes some clambering up ancient staircases 
to the roof where the ritual requires lying down on ones back and 
leaning over backwards to plant a pucker on the piece 
there is more to see around the castle including the rock 
close with its witches kitchen and wishing steps and the castle 
house but sure tis the stone that attracts 
on the road again doubling back south through cork to the 
seacoast resort of kinsale then east and then north toward 
killarney and the precarious and astounding ride around the ring of 
kerry peninsula with its dramatic views from sinuous mountain 
roads take the tour leave the driving to them 
then farther north toward tralee if theres time a side trip 
to the dingle peninsula where ryans daughter was filmed 
and a short ferry ride across the mouth of the shannon to kilrush 
and a few miles across to the atlantic coast town of kilkee 
the spectacular cliffs of mohrer rise up from the ocean on the 
road north toward galway 
then time running out its back south toward shannon and the 
touristy medieval banquet entertainment at bunratty castle 
before one last pint of stout and shopping at shannon airport

following the 14hour flight from bangkok to seattle you stand 
exhausted before the customs inspector your ears are so stuffed 
you hardly hear him say open that bag please 
as you do so carryon items erupt onto the counter among these 
is a papaya youd forgotten to eat during the journey 
travelers delayed behind you glare suspiciously as the inspector 
interrogates you and eventually confiscates the fruit in failing 
to declare it you broke the law 
its that easy to become a criminal while going through 
customs even forgotten fruit prohibited because cropkilling 
parasites may be present gives you a record 
embarrassment and confiscation are minor compared to jail terms 
or fines imposed for illegal drugs firearms or counterfeit goods 
but computerized files give inspectors instant information about 
past infractions which however slight can cause annoying delays 
following future excursions abroad 
your best defense know and abide by regulations all purchases 
and gifts acquired abroad plus repairs and alterations must be

if it is better to light one candle than to curse 
the darkness the volunteer founders of the alzheimers association 
have set a beacon they hope will guide others through a potential 
publichealth nightmare 
one in 62 americans 4 million people already has alzheimers 
disease a debilitating incurable brain affliction that robs 
victims of their memories their capacity to care for themselves 
and over an agonizing period of years their lives 
one in 22 americans 15 million people could have the disease 
within half a century researchers predict increasing the already 
enormous emotional and economic toll on families thrust into the 
grueling gauntlet of caregiving detailed in the book the 36hour 
day 
its a lingering lingering death said jerome h stone a 
wealthy chicago businessman who watched his attractive intelligent 
wife deteriorate into something subhuman after she was 
diagnosed with alzheimers in 1970 
as one of my friends described it its a funeral that never 
ends said stone who turned his helpless frustration over his 
wifes 14year decline to death into the founding passion behind 
the alzheimers association 
this year the chicagobased organization is celebrating its 
10th anniversary and it is regarded as a model for volunteer 
groups said dr gene d cohen deputy director of the national 
institute on aging in bethesda md 
theyre really looked at as one of the truly exemplary family 
associations cohen said theyve been very very effective in 
raising visibility in an area that has been so misunderstood for 
such a long period of time 
since it was founded in 1980 the organization has increased 
from seven initial groups to 210 chapters in 49 states its 
national budget has grown from 78000 to 184 million staffers 
said 
though it began and still relies mostly on volunteers it has 
more than 100 paid workers at its headquarters and its washington 
dc office many chapters have their own offices and staffs 
the association is proud of its effectiveness in lobbying and 
advocacy 
alzheimers disease is recognized by the public and by 
officials as a major publichealth problem since 1985 it has been 
the theme of madefortv movies television news documentaries 
news magazine cover stories and most recently an awardwinning 
country and western song 
federal research funds have increased from 4 million a year 
to 150 million including support for 15 research centers 
thirtythree states have created task forces to study 
alzheimersrelated problems 119 state programs exist financed at 
25 million annually providing services ranging from respite care 
for families to day care for victims to training for care givers 
stone haunted the medical establishments after his wifes 
diagnosis in 1970 in a vain search for information on alzheimers 
disease he found only wisps of data even though 64 years had 
passed since german neurologist alois alzheimer identified the 
disease documenting its characteristic nervefiber tangles in the 
brain of a demented woman 
stone searched out seven disparate family support groups for 
people with various brain diseases and persuaded them to form the 
alzheimers disease and related disorders association 
he agreed to be the groups first chairman inviting charter 
members to chicago as his guests for meetings and he took over 
most of the initial fundraising 
about a month after the associations oneperson office opened 
in new york in autumn 1980 an inquirer to dear abby asked for 
information about alzheimers disease abby inquired at the 
national institutes of health and was given the address of the 
associations little new york office 
within four days of its printing the office received 25000 
pieces of mail according to the association 
we immediately knew all the statistics doctors were giving us 
were wrong that there were alzheimers patients all over the 
country stone said there was a hunger for information 
families needed strategies to cope with victims forgetfulness 
tendency to wander away exaggerated personality traits and 
eventual incapacitation and unresponsiveness 
and they needed a network of other families with whom they could 
share the ordeal of watching a loved one slowly die of 
complications from bed sores feeding problems or pneumonia the 
typical causes of death in alzheimers 
that network is strong today through the 1600 support groups 
the alzheimers association sponsors via local chapters engaging 
more than 35000 volunteers 
jane campbell 34 a chicago restaurant manager whose mother was 
diagnosed with alzheimers disease last year says she has 
benefited greatly from such a group its compassion reassurance 
and experience 
my first meeting all i could do was cry and tell them how 
scared i was and how awful it felt its so bewildering to have 
someone you know not remember where they are who they are and who 
their children are she said 
people said youre in the right place and she returned 
for more group meetings ms campbell said 
much of the groups focus is on problem solving she said how 
to feed someone who doesnt want to eat how to get them to 
exercise how to keep loving someone who has this disease 
hilda pridgeon whose husband was diagnosed with alzheimers 
disease in 1974 when he was only 47 had none of the benefits of 
such an organization but managed to find the wife of another 
victim and then a few other victims wives in minneapolis 
we needed to talk to each other so we wouldnt all go down the 
same deadend streets looking for help said mrs pridgeon 
she later took a leave from her job at data control corp to 
become a founding leader of the association though her husband 
died in 1988 the 64yearold mrs pridgeon remains heavily 
involved 
jerry stone certainly was the glue that held us together and 
got us on the right track in many ways she said but there was 
real core of dedicated people 
not all were present at the organizations beginning 
princess yasmin aga khan jeffries the daughter of perhaps the 
most famous alzheimers disease victim rita hayworth got 
involved in the early 1980s she has since helped raise an 
estimated 5 million through annual galas in her mothers name 
beginning in 1984 
i watched my mother suffer i suffered others suffered im 
committed to it mrs jeffries said from new york 
ms hayworth died in 1987 this years 1000aplate galas are 
scheduled for oct 26 in chicago and nov 1 in new york 
for stone the successes are sweet 
one thing im very proud of i think in 10 years weve 
learned and taught people how to cope he said 
but the successes are not enough he said not when care for 
us alzheimers victims is costing an estimated 88 billion a 
year and the government is spending only 150 million on research 
less than 02 percent of the cost of care to find a cause and 
cure 
from my business sense thats not a very good ratio stone 
said

pat thompson cant walk much anymore 
she is only 49 but has lung disease and uses an electric 
scooter to go shopping and take her treasured neighborhood walks 
all the time hooked up to an oxygen tank 
i had a real intimidation about using the threewheeled 
scooter mrs thompson what will they think what will they 
say 
they she said was everyone around me that silly notion 
that everybodys looking 
thats not a problem anymore and as using scooters becomes more 
acceptable to older people and those with disabilities the 
question will increasingly focus on a consumer issue which one to 
buy 
on a bright clear cool morning 16 people set out on scooters 
along the sixmile bicycle and walking path at valley forge 
national historical park to help find that answer 
only one scooter broke down about two miles into the tour past 
monuments and small log cabins that mark where washingtons troops 
holed up for the winter of 1776 
ecri a nonprofit evaluator of healthcare technology originally 
called emergency care resource institute is trying to help others 
do what mrs thompson had to do herself 
the models tested by ecri show what consumers face when choosing 
a scooter some had three wheels some four some had two 
batteries some one some can turn more easily in tight spots one 
had large wheels and thus better suited to outdoor use some have 
cloth seats some vinyl which can be important to someone with 
incontinence 
mrs thompson last year tried out five scooters without the 
information ecri hopes to provide 
especially after sharing it with so many people at the beach 
this summer i think its important that people have the 
information on what it can do for them said mrs thompson of 
nearby plymouth meeting 
for me personally i wanted to be able to use it in the house 
i wanted to be able to use it in small spaces and i wanted to be 
able to assemble and disassemble it myself 
mine takes me around my neighborhood real nicely stop and 
visit the dogs and the kids the other thing is braking how itll 
handle a hill its maneuverability whether itll tip 
those are exactly the kinds of concerns ecri investigated with 
the financial help of the national institute of disability research 
and rehabilitation the us department of education and the 
national rehabilitation hospital 
the engineers and other ecri employees at valley forge rated 
scooters for comfort hillclimbing braking stability of the 
ride driver fatigue speed control and battery power the outdoor 
test is part of the testing from which ecri expects to release 
results around next june 
mrs thompson said her scooter will tip but that if she gets in 
a tricky spot she can get a foot out to brace herself many people 
who use such vehicles such as stroke patients with some paralysis 
arent so fortunate said kenneth brown of ecri 
you dont have an arm to brace yourself you just kind of go 
over in it said brown who leaned to one side on two wheels to 
demonstrate 
sharon lawler a marketing specialist for ecri who rode one of 
the scooters said ecri has no ties to manufacturers that way 
people can be sure that our data is at least objective 
her scooter made it but rob schluths didnt have the power to 
handle the hills at the park that wont ruin its evaluation 
ecris brown said it will simply put it in perspective of what is 
determined in other tests that may make it good for indoor use 
if the unit is acceptable it would be conditionally 
acceptable that you dont take it out on rough terrain he said 
having 15 finishers impressed brown i didnt expect this many 
to do this well a lot of these models were indoor models and they 
handled the park very well he said 
scooter prices range from 1500 to 3500 brown said 
generally insurance has not helped pay the bill he said 
pat suda national sales director for scooter manufacturer 
orthokinetics of waukesha wis said medicare rarely reimburses 
for the scooters she said the company is telling distributors 
be prepared to ask for cash dont ask what their insurance is 
she agrees with ecri that projections of the aging of the us 
population promises growth in the scooter market al thieme has 
seen the growth firsthand thieme made his first scooter 22 years 
ago for his wife who suffered multiple sclerosis now he has a 9 
million business as president of amigo a bridgeport michbased 
manufacturer of scooters 
today theres a lot of competition there are probably 20 
different manufacturers in the united states and i would say 20 to 
25 manufacturers in other countries thieme said

when 28yearold artist jack frankfurter left 
his first professional art job designing silver at tiffany amp co 
he took off for rome with every intention of returning after a 
years study 
a year turned into decades and when frankfurter finally came 
back it was as an artist with five oil triptychs installed in the 
fabled stores fifth avenue windows not as a silver designer 
its closing a circle in a way he said 
for frankfurter 61 the tiffany paintings represent more than a 
return to the place where he began his professional art career 
they also represent a symbolic return to his childhood and a 20th 
century america he left long ago for the classical attractions of 
italy 
born in austria in 1929 frankfurter moved to new york with his 
family at the outbreak of world war ii he studied fine arts and 
literature at columbia university and cooper union and briefly 
taught college english 
he joined tiffany though he had no experience designing silver 
he created coffee pots and teapots ashtrays clocks and hurricane 
lamps 
his designs he said were generally modern but usually echoed 
classical designs his interest in the art of antiquity led him 
toward italy 
in 1957 frankfurter secured a grant to attend the university of 
rome for a year tiffany asked him to return to their studios 
afterward but those plans were shattered within his first few 
months in rome 
i was taken by the fact that it was absolutely beautiful he 
said it became obvious to me that this is what i wanted to paint 
all along 
through the 60s and 70s frankfurter was a success exhibits 
throughout italy and in london new york munich and los angeles 
works in museums and the private collections of malcolm forbes 
gore vidal and frederico fellini designs for theater productions 
in several european cities 
the last decade by his own admission was not his most 
productive but frankfurter sees his tiffany show in may the 
first exhibit of his work in the united states since 1976 as the 
start of a new period in his career 
i found that while living in rome id lost contact with 
america he said during the last decade though he began to use 
his art to explore american themes in particular the america of 
his childhood 
as far as my art was concerned and as far as my outlook was 
concerned i had many more roots in america he said even 
after 32 years in italy i think ill always be a foreigner 
there 
although he often feels like a fish out of water when he 
returns to the united states he remains profoundly attracted to 
this country his recent works reflect that conflict they are 
crowded with nostalgic symbols of american cultural life laced with 
cynicism and irony 
in one triptych by the sea a collage of images includes 
carousel horses family album snapshots a toy sailboat an ice 
cream cone and a hot dog all painted with oil in a style that 
gives it a windblown and weathered look as if the triptych and 
the memories were left out in the salt air for a halfcentury 
another painting dream vending machine depicts a 
coinoperated machine in the shape of a movie marquee the inside 
is littered with cultural icons of wealth and prestige a cruise 
ship a daimler a wedding in paris and champagne but the glass of 
the machine is cracked and plastered on it is a sign that reads 
out of order 
theyre not optimistic i dont have that great optimism he 
said 
i played with my early memories of america he said 
whether i enjoyed it or not its what i look back on 
frankfurter is not certain whether he could return permanently 
to the united states but is sure about his work 
i have more desire to work now and more endurance at it than 
years ago when i would gladly put down my brushes early at the end 
of the day to go out with my friends he said now i happily 
work until midnight because im enjoying what im doing

terrence page and maryon freifelder have been an 
unlikely pair of friends for three years teaming up on issues of 
interest to young and old 
page is a senior at miami central high school freifelder is an 
activist with the american association of retired persons and a 
member of floridas silverhaired legislature 
together they have traveled across the state on campaigns for 
new laws now they are teaming up again to promote a new 
crimeprevention project linking the two generations 
we sincerely believe that youth and age if were willing to 
walk hand in hand can solve any problem in this community 
freifelder said 
the program called youth and elderly against crime was kicked 
off recently with a pep rally organized by dade county schools 
citizens crime watch jewish family services crime prevention 
group and freifelder and pages intergenerational law advocacy 
group 
of the 79000 crimes committed in miami last year only 
twotenths of 1 percent involved seniors but crimes against the 
elderly create a sense of outrage and opened the door for the 
program 
about 150 students from three innercity high schools will be 
linked with two senior housing complexes a senior community center 
and a downtown church to survey seniors about crime and suggest 
solutions 
one of the programs biggest achievements would be to eliminate 
a widely expressed fear among the elderly of teenagers all 
teenagers 
whole generations especially those living in the inner city 
have expressed nothing but fear said vern thornton director of 
the state attorney generals seniors vs crime project this fear 
leads to the elderly community imprisoning themselves at home 
page has felt the unwillingness of seniors to accept teenage 
strangers but he considers that a minor setback 
one of the reasons why theres resistance is a lot of time 
its hard for people to believe that somebody cares the 
18yearold said 
but he sees the generation gap as a misunderstanding that can be 
resolved 
in the first stage of the oneyear project teenagers will be 
matched with a designated group of seniors in their neighborhoods 
to meet regularly and draft crimeprevention plans 
other miami programs already focus on crimes against the elderly 
and linking old and young but this extends the existing projects 
christell porter who arranges crimeprevention meetings for 
jewish family services organized about 35 residents of the mildred 
and claude pepper towers to attend the kickoff rally 
her group already offers deadbolt locks peepholes and 
heavyduty metal screening for windows 
dade county public schools offer adoptagrandparent and senior 
mentors for creative student programs to capitalize on the assets 
of each generation 
we have the two extremes we have the young who are somewhat 
unaware of the problems associated with being old second we have 
the old octogenarians worried about their ability to protect 
themselves against crime said police chief perry anderson i 
think theyll be looking out for each other

when the air gets nippy people ask me 
if ive put the garden to bed never the cows that watched me 
weeding the corn in july see me in snowboots and earflaps in 
december picking brussels sprouts for christmas dinner 
some of the tastiest and most nutritious crops thrive in autumn 
and are still good in winter 
the yearround gardener looks forward to chilly nights to put 
flavor into parsnips and sprouts he or she makes room in the 
vegetable patch for other hardy crops like late broccoli chinese 
cabbage kale collards beets leeks carrots turnips spinach 
swiss chard and other greens 
scientists say cool weather affects the metabolism of some 
plants promoting sugar buildups and concealing less attractive 
flavors when frost is killing tender crops like tomatoes and 
beans hardy vegetables are just reaching their prime 
one of the best of these crops is brussels sprouts some of us 
think long a favorite in europe sprouts are strangely missing 
from most american gardens the national gardening association 
estimates only one gardener in 10 grows them 
perhaps too few gardeners have picked fresh frostsweetened 
sprouts in late fall cooked them just to the forktender stage and 
served them with melted butter the association says in its 
gardening guide 
some gardeners may have fumbled by planting sprouts too soon or 
too late in my garden 50 miles north of new york city the best 
time is october coinciding with the first frosts 
if planted in early spring they mature in midsummer with 
inferior taste if planted too late the plants dont grow enough 
you have to experiment in your own climate and especially with 
conditions in your own garden to get it right 
parsnips one of the sweetest of vegetables are also curiously 
absent from many gardens perhaps a yen for instant gratification 
turns some of us away for parsnips require waiting and 
attention 
planted in early spring the edible root doesnt start 
sweetening until the autumn chill a waiting time of six months 
and more some growers think they dont reach their best until they 
have wintered over almost a year after sowing 
like carrots parsnips are difficult to germinate after 
numerous failures outdoors i resorted to sowing them indoors in 
flats under lights where i could keep them both warm and damp this 
worked giving me nice seedlings to transplant in may 
because parsnips are a deepthrusting root plant the soil must 
be worked carefully to remove stones i use an iron bar to punch 
deep holes which i fill with compost and plant the seedlings in 
those after these initial efforts the plants need occasional 
watering but thats about all 
i start digging up my parsnips after a few hard frosts using a 
trowel or spading fork to protect them from the bitterest cold 
mulch them with leaves or hay and then harvest them as you desire 
all winter long and into early spring in the south they may be 
dug a few at a time and stored in the refrigerator where the cold 
will sweeten them 
broccoli nicetasting all summer acquires an extra tang in 
autumn this vegetable is an ideal garden crop in my area for a 
single planting in early spring will yield large heads in summer 
and then florets deep into november 
breeders have also produced varieties like waltham and green 
valiant that are planted in midsummer to yield large central heads 
in the fall 
romanesco an italian heirloom variety recently offered in us 
seed catalogs produces a gorgeous chartreuse head broccoli 
especially eaten raw ranks at the top of nutrition charts for its 
vitamins and minerals 
also outstanding nutritionally kale yields tasty greens in the 
fall and winter its lacy leaves add a nice touch to the salad 
bowl 
late lettuces with names like arctic king and north pole produce 
deep into fall and early winter third harvests are prolonged in 
coldframes or under transparent synthetic covers peas will yield a 
fall crop although not as abundant as in spring 
cut back to ground level in late fall and mulched deeply swiss 
chard sends up fresh tender leaves in early spring you cut these 
for salads even as youre planting next seasons crop truly the 
garden never sleeps

floridas strength as a magnet for 
retirees seeking sun sand and palm trees may be diminishing 
a recent university of florida study of us census data shows 
the numbers of elderly people moving to the southeast dropped in 
the first half of the 1980s compared with the 25 previous years 
stephen golant a university demographer who published the study 
in julys journal of gerontology predicts the drop will continue 
through the 1990s for several reasons 
fewer babies were born during the depression the age group 
now beginning to turn 65 
the northeast and midwest provide more retirement 
opportunities 
the recession of the early 1980s made it difficult for 
northern retirees to sell their homes and move 
also golant said a youth movement seems to be stirring in 
florida with a backlash against retirement communities 
whats happening is that the glamour of having an older 
population in ones community is if anything dampening rather 
than increasing golant said 
communities once synonymous with retirement miami beach and 
st petersburg have made efforts to attract younger people 
because of the realization that retirees demand more services he 
said 
florida population projections show the states over65 
population growing 26 percent in the 1990s compared with 71 
percent in the 1970s and 44 percent during the 1980s

apple computer inc which has taken a 
battering on wall street as it contends with a computer industry 
slowdown is betting its bottom line on three new lowerpriced 
macintoshes it will introduce monday 
analysts are divided over whether apples effort to gain market 
share at the expense of profit margins will revitalize the company 
or cut into earnings 
investors so far appear to be wary apples stock price has 
plummeted from a high of 50 a share during the past year to a low 
of 2550 last week before closing friday at 2825 
apples overall unit shipments have declined and you can make 
a very strong case that the markets apple is trying to enter now 
are much more closed than they used to be said douglas kass an 
analyst at dataquest inc a san josebased research firm they 
missed the window of opportunity in the lower end a year and a half 
ago 
kass said the new machines will produce a pretty rapid spike 
in sales and will strengthen apples midrange offerings but he 
added i dont think the low end will generate that much to make 
it a big deal 
others are more optimistic 
people forget what happens when you introduce a very 
inexpensive version of a product that a lot of people want said 
michael murphy editor of the california technology stock letter in 
san francisco apples volume is going to go through the roof i 
may be out in left field in this but i think this totally reverses 
their fortunes 
apple stagnating with a 9 percent share of the 67 billion 
personal computer market down from a peak of 14 percent in 1987 
is launching its new machines with a 40 million television and 
print advertising campaign 
the company is cranking up production of the computers to the 
limit anticipating strong demand as it introduces the machines 
simultaneously in 121 countries 
most of the companys dealers already have been given previews 
of the computers and despite a reluctance by apple executives to 
provide details before monday there arent many secrets 
the mac classic a compact desktop computer based on the 
motorola 68000 microprocessor with a builtin blackandwhite 
monitor will be priced at about 1000 with a floppydisk drive 
and 1500 with a 40megabyte hard disk drive 
the list prices are less than half those of the comparable and 
very popular macintosh plus and se models and street prices are 
expected to be several hundred dollars lower 
the macintosh lc based on the more powerful motorola 68020 
microprocessor and listed at 2400 with a 40megabyte hard disk 
and the macintosh si based on the still more powerful motorola 
68030 and priced 3800 to 4500 with an 80megabyte hard disk 
are several thousand dollars cheaper than existing models both 
will have separately available 12inch monitors blackandwhite 
for 300 or color for 600 
most analysts predict the lc apples first lowcost color 
model eventually will be the hottest seller of the new machines 
but it wont be ready in volume until january costing apple the 
key christmas sales season 
the computers wont be as cheap as the least expensive clones of 
international business machines corp personal computers but the 
new macs will be competitive with ibm clones equipped to use 
windows 30 the software from microsoft corp that gives 
ibmcompatible machines the look and feel of macintoshes 
apple chairman and chief executive officer john sculley 
acknowledges the risks in introducing new products with lower 
profit margins but he said he thinks the timing is right with a 
recession looming and industry sales bumping along sluggishly 
until the introduction of windows 30 in may apples 
macintoshes because of their unique easytouse design allowed 
the company to keep prices high and attain more than 50 percent 
gross profit margins 
the strategy apple has been pursuing in the late 1980s is one 
which made us the third most profitable computer company in the 
world sculley said at a recent briefing with reporters it was 
a pretty good one when we had high industry growth when there 
wasnt anyone who had technology that looked anything like ours 
and when we were trying to reposition apple from a toy company to a 
serious computer company 
its quite clear that with the industry slowing down with 
more competition out there that apple if it is going to be a 
significant player in the 1990s has to go for market share and get 
very aggressive he said 
sculley said he believes investors will support the strategy 
as long as the products are well received by the market and 
the efforts lead to higher market share 
with the christmas buying season beginning it shouldnt take 
long for investors to find out if apples plan is correct the big 
question facing apple and every desktop computer maker though is 
whether the weak economy will scuttle sales for everyone

business leaders cant agree on whether 
the us economy is headed for a recession 
i guess i would align myself with those who believe we are in 
or are entering a recession said willard c butcher chairman of 
chase manhattan bank 
but while john s reed chairman of citicorp describes it as a 
difficult period he says hes not ready to throw in the 
sponge 
and david t kerns chairman of the xerox corp says he doesnt 
have the slightest idea whether the united states is in a 
recession 
there were other topics discussed at the business councils 
weekend meeting at this mountain resort the persian gulf crisis 
the federal budget deficit and the baseball playoffs but 
recession took center stage 
the councils semiannual economic outlook report prepared by 19 
corporate economists set the tone 
there is first of all a very big difference in what our 
consultants are projecting now compared to what they were 
projecting last spring lewis t preston chairman of jp morgan 
amp co and council vice chairman told reporters before presenting 
the report to leaders of the nations top 100 corporations 
while threefourths of the economists believe the economy still 
can skirt a recession this year projected growth in the second 
half was down to 03 percent at an annual rate compared with a 2 
percent rate projected in may 
five of the 19 panelists said an economic downturn would occur 
before years end 
in a session with reporters 12 of the councils corporate 
chiefs assessed their particular industries while most agreed on 
the overall economic sluggishness many noted that weakness varied 
from industry to industry and from region to region 
it feels like a recession in some segments said general 
electric co chairman john f welch jr who becomes council 
chairman in january in other segments things are quite good 
citicorps reed said consumers were reflecting the economy 
we look at our credit card business and we see different 
patterns depending on the state of the economy in a given area 
he said 
in areas where the economy is very weak consumers tend to 
prepay their outstanding and put the card in a drawer reed said 
and in areas where theyre feeling good they tend to use it 
normally 
but most agreed that even those industries that had not been 
greatly affected by the economic sluggishness earlier in the year 
slowed dramatically after the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
there is still growth but at a lesser rate than in the past 
said james d robinson iii chairman of the american express co 
this too changes as you go across the country the 
northeast of course being quite hard hit now central and western 
parts of the country however spending still a bit more robust 
he said 
robinson welch and others agreed that housing and consumer 
spending on durable goods bigticket items such as appliances and 
automobiles have been most adversely affected 
those items were sliding even before the persian gulf crisis in 
part because of high interest rates the oilprice shock has 
removed even more money with which to buy them 
housing starts instead of being up about 225 percent are 
going to be down about 1225 percent this year said sd bechtel 
jr chairman emeritus of the bechtel group inc next year more 
of the same 
bechtel also said nonresidential construction would be down 
considerably this year 
our consumerrelated businesses appliances light bulbs and 
things like that were going along at a fairly even keel for the 
first seven months and clearly were affected in august by the 
shock that hit the system and orders fell off in line with consumer 
confidence said ges welch so weve seen a real slowdown in 
the consumer durable side 
among those industries still experiencing some strength include 
food drugs and health care areas most resistant to recessionary 
effects the business leaders said 
consumer credit continues to be good but were seeing a modest 
rise across the country in delinquencies and charge offs said 
chase manhattans butcher interestingly about 50 percent of 
thse delinquencies and charge offs are individual bankruptcies 
in the heavy machinery sector both aircraft and electrical 
machinery orders are strong welch said 
roger b smith retired chairman of general motors corp said 
the automobile industry still expects a very good year

xerox corp the sleeping giant of office 
products companies has woken up 
analysts say its about time after the companys loss of its 
dominant position in the copier industry and its foray into the 
financial services business 
xerox this week launches a television advertising campaign that 
the company hopes will shake its image as merely a photocopier 
maker and establish it as the document company 
in an industry now bursting with facsimile machines fancy 
copiers optical scanners and personal computers paul allaire 
xeroxs new president and chief executive wants top billing for 
the company that invented the plainpaper copier 
theres no other company that can come close to making the 
kind of claims and positionings that we do allaire said in a 
recent interview we think it really does build from our heritage 
and should give us an advantage of uniqueness in todays crowded 
information industry 
the ad campaign which includes a catchy broadway show tune is 
more than a sales pitch the company wants to change the mindset of 
both whitecollar america and xerox employees themselves 
the message is that xerox whose name is virtually synonymous 
with photocopying can help office workers create and publish 
splashy reports not just copy individual pieces of paper 
by focusing on the document we actually see more opportunity 
for xerox said leonard vickers xeroxs senior vice president 
for marketing yes well sing and dance but its a lot 
more than that were just sharpening and redefining the business 
were in around the document 
by stressing the importance of quality documents xerox can sell 
more of its printers scanners fax machines computer networks 
work stations electric typewriters software and of course 
copiers vickers said then theres its newest product docutech a 
220000 multifunctional machine that allows users to create and 
alter documents digitally as well as publish them 
analysts say xerox is onto something 
clearly the direction is right said b alex henderson an 
analyst with prudential bache securities in new york nobodys 
doubting that this is what they need to do 
analysts have long criticized xerox for branching out into the 
financial services businesses in 1979 when it established the xerox 
credit corp today allaire has put some of those businesses on the 
auction block and is considering selling others 
we will look at every one of them and if we cannot have a game 
plan to have each of those units deliver at least a 15 percent 
return on equity we will look at ways of not being in those 
businesses said the 52yearold allaire who took the helm at 
xerox in august 
xerox has already started doing that it announced thursday an 
agreement to sell navco corp an auto insurance company to a 
subsidiary of general motors acceptance corp for approximately 
250 million 
like a lot of huge corporations they got led down the 
unrelated diversification path said david j schofield a 
technology analyst with duff amp phelps in chicago and it seems 
the general consensus is that that doesnt work 
the financial services business was once seen as a way to make 
up for a drop in xeroxs share of the plainpaper copier market 
japanese competition reduced xeroxs share to 85 percent in 1985 
xerox increased that to a 152 percent share last year according 
to dataquest inc last year the company won the commerce 
departments malcolm baldrige quality award 
xerox last year had net income of 704 million on revenues of 
176 billion compared to net income of 632 million on revenues 
of 164 billion in 1988 
while the advertising campaign wont change xeroxs image 
overnight company officials say it is the dawn of a new era 
the campaign is paul allaires effort to create a 90s 
corporation vickers said theres a very hardheaded logic 
behind what looks like a softhearted campaign were doing it 
for the best of all reasons to make money to grow the company 
it began as an internal campaign in september when allaire sent 
out letters and a booklet to xeroxs 111400 employees explaining 
the document company strategy 
the campaign went public two weeks ago in select newspaper and 
radio advertisements but will hit mainstream america during the 
first game of the world series on tuesday with one of a series of 
lively sometimes thoughtful television ads 
all the radio and television ads are accompanied by a version of 
a stephen sondheim song putting it together from the broadway 
show sunday in the park with george

ibm said today its profit jumped nearly 27 
percent in the third quarter despite weakening economic conditions 
at home and abroad 
international business machines corp said net income for the 
three months ended sept 30 totaled 111 billion or 195 a 
share up from 877 million or 151 a share in the same quarter 
last year 
revenue rose nearly 7 percent to 1528 billion from 1430 
billion in the yearago period 
overall sales slipped 15 percent to 901 billion but revenue 
derived from support services software equipment rental and 
financing posted doubledigit increases over the yearearlier 
period 
the earnings were slightly below the expectations of industry 
analysts 
despite weakening economies in the us and other parts of the 
world and a major product transition we continue to make progress 
on the course we have set for the business ibm chairman john f 
akers said in a statement 
he said the company based in suburban armonk is encouraged 
by customer response to the recent introduction of the system390 
line a new generation of mainframe computers that are about twice 
as powerful as current models the line was unveiled in early 
september though some models wont be available until the third 
quarter of 1991 
akers said the worlds largest computer company also was seeing 
the benefits from a costcutting plan announced late last year the 
restructuring includes the elimination of about 10000 jobs and 
plant consolidations the move was prompted by a slowdown in the 
computer industry 
our portfolio of products and services which is the strongest 
in our history and our geographic diversity are serving us well 
akers said assuming no further deterioration in the worlds 
economies we continue to expect substantially improved financial 
performance for 1990 
for the years first nine months ibm reported net earnings of 
356 billion or 621 a share up 12 percent from 317 billion 
or 543 a share in the 1989 period

almost 9 percent from 422 billion in the same period a year 
earlier

the supreme court today left intact a 1 
million punitivedamages award won against the celotex corp by a 
new york man who sued over his exposure to asbestos 
the justices without comment refused to hear arguments that 
the award wrongly was based on mere negligence and not as required 
by new york law on a finding of reckless or intentional conduct 
john e johnson who from 1942 to 1945 worked as an 
electricians helper at the brooklyn navy yard was diagnosed after 
his retirement in 1985 as having a lung condition caused by 
asbestos exposure 
johnson sued celotex and other asbestos manufacturers over their 
failure to warn him about the dangers of such exposure 
asbestos has been used for decades in the construction of 
buildings and ships inhalation of asbestos fibers has been linked 
to various diseases 
tens of thousands of personalinjury lawsuits have been filed 
against asbestos manufacturers by shipyard workers hundreds of 
asbestosinbuildings suits also have been filed 
some asbestos makers have sought protection by filing for 
bankruptcy 
after a trial on johnsons charges us district judge charles 
sifton awarded him 350000 in compensatory damages and 28 
million in punitive damages 
celotex one of three defendants who had not settled before 
trial with johnson was ordered to pay 1 million of the 28 
million punitivedamages award 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld siftons ruling 
last march 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for celotex argued that 
the appeals court misapplied new york law in upholding the 
punitivedamages award 
the appeal also contended that johnsons case wrongly had been 
consolidated with a lawsuit filed in behalf of a man who had died 
from a disease attributed to asbestos 
johnson lives in long island but a lawyer who worked on his case 
could not say which community 
the case is the celotex corporation vs johnson 90339

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a group of shipping companies ordered to beef up pension funds for 
dockworkers in mobile ala and philadelphia 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
companies say jeopardizes some labor negotiations along the east 
coast 
the case stems from a settlement in 1988 between the 
international longshoremans association and the carriers container 
council a group of shippers that administers a benefit fund for 
east coast dockworkers 
the council is an outgrowth of a 1977 labor dispute prompted by 
the changing nature of the longshore industry up to that time 
contributions to pension plans were based on the number of 
manhours worked 
but with the advent of containerized shipping there was a drop 
in hours worked at smaller ports such as mobile pension fund 
contributions now are based on tonnage of cargo loaded and unloaded 
at the docks 
the 1988 agreement between the council and the ila left the 
shipping association with a 57 million surplus the shipping 
companies said they contributed too much money to the fund because 
their tonnage assessments were mistakenly too high 
pension fund managers for the philadelphia and mobile workers 
did not sign the 1988 pact 
collective bargaining in the industry operates on two tiers a 
national level designed to produce an overall union contract for 
docks from maine to texas and at a local level at each port in 
which ila locals negotiate with their employers 
the philadelphia and mobile funds sued the shipping company 
group over the 1988 surplus a federal judge in alabama ordered the 
companies to pay 153 million to the philadelphia fund and 42 
million to the mobile pension plan 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in march agreed that the 
companies must make restitution to the two funds but sent the case 
back for further hearings on the proper amount of damages 
the appeals court also upheld a related ruling by another 
federal judge who said the shippers group must pay more money to 
the mobile fund for withdrawing as a contributor to that plan 
the judge ordered the shippers to pay 12 million for 
withdrawing the appeals court said the amount must be determined 
by an arbitrator 
in its appeal to the supreme court the shipping companies said 
the appeals court ruling could interfere with negotiations between 
labor and management to keep pension funds solvent 
but the 11th circuit court said federal pension law generally 
prohibits employers from recovering surplus money contributed to an 
employee trust fund 
the ila supported the shipping company appeal the union said 
the appeals court ruling could mean disaster for collective 
bargaining in the industry 
the case is carriers container council vs mobile steamship 
association 90323

compaq computer corp on monday introduced a new 
notebooksized personal computer experts say will give the company 
an edge over the competition in laptop models 
the new model from the houstonbased personal computer maker 
uses several innovations to squeeze its electronics including a 20 
megahertz intel corp 386sx microprocessor into an 8by11inch 
7pound machine 
compaq said the computer uses technology originally developed 
for the defense industry the technology allows the computers 
circuit board to fold in half to take up less space 
compaq calls the new lte 386s20 introduced at a news 
conference in new york the highest performance notebook 
computer on the market 
although at least one competitor has announced a 386sxbased 
notebook computer compaq will be the first to ship such a machine 
when its dealers start receiving the model later this month 
industry experts said 
the computer has a suggested retail price of 6999 for a model 
with a 60megabyte fixed disk drive and 6499 for one with a 
30megabyte drive it will sell in the range of 5000 at compaq 
dealers 
compaq also announced an optional attachment that increases the 
performance of the computer when it is used on a desk 
several industry observers said the new machine may prove too 
expensive particularly at a time when the economy is declining 
and when several competitors are poised to introduce lowerpriced 
notebook machines 
i think its an exciting product and i think its an exciting 
technology but at that high of a price tag im not sure said

the owners of the wall street journal announced 
monday they will halt the circulation of the asian wall street 
journal in singapore following the publication of new restrictions 
on the foreign press there 
what the government of singapore wants is for the foreign 
press to practice selfcensorship dow jones amp co the majority 
owner of the asian wall street journal said in an editorial a 
facade of factual reporting will be allowed but any statement by 
authorities must be taken at face value 
the editorial published in mondays editions of the asian 
journal the wall street journal in the united states and the wall 
street journal europe also accused time warner incs asiaweek of 
cooperating with singapores regulations asiaweek recently 
published a positive cover story on retiring prime minister lee 
kuan yew 
asiaweeks editor michael oneil said the editorial was 
factually incorrect and that the story on lee was not too 
soft he declined to comment further 
lee in a speech monday in hong kong to the commonwealth press 
union said the journals decision was of little consequence 
dow jones decision is the latest in a longrunning battle 
between its two asian publications the asian wall street journal 
and the far eastern economic review and the singapore government 
in 1987 singapore restricted the circulation of the asian 
journal from 5000 copies to 400 after the journal ran a story 
about singapores efforts to start a second stock market the 
government criticized the story in a 1500 word letter that the 
journal refused to print in full 
singapore also limited the review to 400 copies for reporting on 
the governments treatment of the political opposition and other 
sensitive topics 
when the review halted its circulation in singapore the 
government altered its copyright laws to allow a local printing 
house to reprint copies of the review and sell them in singapore 
it was not immediately known whether singapore would also allow 
printing houses to do the same with the journal 
dow jones decision follows the passing of new regulations by 
singapores parliament on aug 30 under the regulations foreign 
publications are required to obtain an annual distribution permit 
if they distribute more than 300 copies in singapore and if they 
carry articles on politics and current affairs on any country in 
southeast asia 
the new regulations also require such foreign publications to 
post an unspecified security deposit that can be put toward any 
legal liabilities or court costs the publications might face in 
singapore 
what worries us here is not any one provision dow jones 
said in its editorial what worries us is the purpose to which 
five years of experience warns us these powers will be put

pepsico inc said its thirdquarter earnings 
rose 25 percent as all of its businesses posted sales and profit 
gains

intel corp announced monday a set of compact 
powersaving microprocessor chips that will enable computer makers 
to produce smaller laptop computers with longer battery life 
in picking tokyo to announce the new version of its highly 
popular 386 microprocessor dubbed the 386 sl the us chip 
company underscored japans growing domination of laptops one of 
the fastestgrowing areas of the computer market 
intels powerful 386 microprocessor is used as the brains of 
many ibmcompatible personal computers but previous versions 
consumed relatively large amounts of power helping drain the 
batteries of portable computers 
intel said the new chips made especially for laptop and smaller 
palmtop computers would cut power use in half 
the announcement of the 386 sl and other associated chips 
represents intels entry into the market for chip sets or 
packages of chips used by computer makers to build clones of ibm 
and other computers 
advances in semiconductor technology since intel introduced the 
first 386 processor in 1985 also have allowed it to combine the 
functions of many chips in one microprocessor 
intel said the new 386 sl processor contains 855000 
transistors and includes a shortterm memory a main memory 
controller and computer management circuitry 
with the new chip set a computer that mimics the popular at 
model of international business machines corp can be built with 
only 10 chips plus memory on one circuit board measuring four by 
six inches compared with 170 chips for early 386based computers 
intel said 
by 1993 only one chip plus memory will be needed to make the 
same computer said david house president of intels microcomputer 
components group 
we have shrunk the 386 to a fraction of its original size 
said intel president andrew grove this also made it possible for 
the chip to run faster and for us to make it more cheaply but more 
importantly it leaves us the room to add additional chip 
functions 
included in the 386 sl is a new power management system that 
automatically shuts off unused computer components to conserve 
battery life 
lower power consumption also allows manufacturers to reduce the 
weight of laptops by using smaller batteries one of the heaviest 
components 
intel said the 386 sl will cost 176 in bulk computers 
containing the chips will become available early next year it 
said 
grove said japan now accounts for 10 percent of intels 
approximately 4 billion in annual sales a share that may grow 
with the new chip set 
we brought this introduction to japan in recognition of 
japans leadership in computer packaging and display technology 
which are the other key technologies in portable computers grove 
told reporters 
while us companies remain strong n desktop computers 
japanese companies have introduced a flurry of highperformance 
laptops and are rapidly increasing their world market share 
laptop sales have grown particularly rapidly in japan where 
limited housing and office space often prohibits the permanent use 
of desk space for a fullsize personal computer

united airlines parent company today announced 
an order worth up to 22 billion for 128 boeing aircraft the 
largest airplane deal in history 
the agreement includes firm orders for 34 boeing model 777s 
the firstever purchase of that new plane and 30 boeing 747400s 
plus options on 34 model 777s and 30 model 747400s 
united one of the nations biggest airlines had come close to 
placing the widebody order earlier this year but postponed it in 
july at the request of uals labor unions who were leading an 
effort to buy the company 
the employees failed to get bank financing for a 44 billion 
bid and uals board rejected their offer last tuesday 
this is uniteds third major aircraft order in 18 months its 
last order for 370 narrowbody boeing jetliners came in april 
1989 
this purchase will allow united to replace older aircraft as 
well as expand both its domestic and international services said 
stephen wolf chairman of ual corp the parent company of 
chicagobased united 
in short it will ensure that this company is positioned to 
compete aggressively around the world he said in a statement 
in seattle boeing commercial airplane group spokesman richard 
schleh said the twinengine 777 designed to fill a market niche 
between the 747400 and the existing 767300 widebody will be 209 
feet long have a wingspan of 197 feet and will seat 360 to 390 
passengers in two classes 
the importance of todays commitment for boeing cannot be 
overstated said boeing chairman and chief executive officer 
frank shrontz with a ratification by boeings board on oct 29 
this order will launch an allnew 777 aircraft family which will 
set a new standard for very large twinengine operations around the 
world 
united is to receive its first 777s in may 1995 and the first of 
its new 747s in 1994 schleh said both planes will be powered by 
variations of pratt amp whitneys pw4000 engine 
united had long been rumored as the 777s launch customer 
boeing confirmed this summer it was discussing the 777 with united 
and seven other carriers including american airlines british 
airways japan airlines and cathay pacific 
uniteds 777s will seat 363 passengers 38 in first class and 
325 in economy the 747s which normally seat 412 in three classes 
will be in a variety of configurations tailored to specific 
markets boeing said 
boeing earlier had said it planned the 777 for 350375 
passengers 
boeing plans to build the jets with folding wingtips to allow 
it to fit at existing airport gates united however has not yet 
selected the folding wings as an option schleh said 
the 777 will have a range of up to 4800 statute miles that 
compares with the longrange 767300 which can carry 261 
passengers in mixed classes 7200 miles and the 747400 the 
worlds largest commercial jet which can fly 8000 miles 
boeing already is talking about building a family of 777 
aircraft and has proposed a version that could haul 300320 up to 
7600 miles the design eventually could be adapted further with a 
stretched fuselage boeing says

kuwaiti oil minister rashid 
alameeri monday discounted speculation that oil prices would reach 
100 a barrel in the event of a military strike to liberate kuwait 
ameeri who is with the kuwaiti governmentinexile set up in 
saudi arabia after iraqs aug 2 invasion told a press conference 
that oil prices would increase in the event of hostilities but not 
that high 
he said iraqi troops have placed mines around kuwaiti oil 
fields refineries and other installations war would result in 
further damage to kuwaiti oil installations he said 
but he added that kuwaiti leaders have drawn up contingency 
plans to reconstruct the facilities with international assistance 
ameeris statements were clearly intended to reassure the world 
about the oil supply as more and more kuwaitis are heard expressing 
impatience with the un sanctions against iraq and pressing for a 
usled military strike to end the 10weekold iraqi occupation of 
their country 
independent oil industry executives have said the market would 
suffer a severe upheaval in the event of a military conflagration 
but the extent of the oil price hikes would depend on the amount of 
damage to the oil facilities and the duration of hostilities 
theyve also noted that saudi arabia which sits on onethird of 
the worlds proven oil reserves would exert itself to stabilize 
the market 
the saudis were instrumental in offsetting the shortfall caused 
by iraqs invasion which took 4 million barrels per day off the 
market the kingdom increased its own output by about 2 million 
barrels per day to 75 million barrels and urged other members of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries to increase their 
production 
oil experts note that the kingdom is also preparing to reuse oil 
facilities that were laid to waste during the lean years of the 
glutted world oil market in the early to mid1980s 
ameeri was attending a threeday conference in jiddah of 
prominent kuwaiti exiles discussing their countrys plight and its 
future 
he said the recent increase in oil prices was not the result of 
a shortage in oil supplies but of fears about war in the gulf 
former saudi oil minister ahmed zaki yamani said recently that 
oil prices would rise to 100 dollars a barrel if war broke out 
ameeri noted that oil production has increased to make up for 
lost supplies from kuwait and iraq he also said countries could 
release oil from their strategic reserves 
if the crisis is resolved quickly then the shortfall in the 
market can be offset he said but if the crisis lingers on 
the market would not be able to put up with the adverse 
consequences 
ameeri estimated kuwait was losing 50 million to 60 million a 
day in income because of the shutdown of its oil industry kuwaits 
preinvasion output was 15 million barrels a day 
he also estimated that the iraqis are now pumping about 90000 
barrels a day just meeting the needs of local power stations and 
desalination plants

the early october sales rate for cars and trucks 
made by the big three automakers in north america dropped 48 
percent from the same period last year when sales began a 
threemonth slump the automakers said monday 
yeartoyear comparisons were clouded by wild swings in the 
september and october sales rates last year prompted mainly by 
incentives and announcements of price increases 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
their domestically made cars and light trucks sold at an average 
daily rate of 27620 from oct 110 this year compared with a 
daily rate of 29016 during the same time last year 
car and truck sales fell 15 percent and 107 percent 
respectively 
consumers who planned to buy cars in the last quarter of 1989 
headed to dealerships early to take advantage of incentives before 
they ended and to avoid previously announced price boosts for 
1990model cars and trucks 
for example gm offered its dealers big incentives in september 
1989 to clear their lots for 1990 cars and trucks customers 
flocked to showrooms and that resulted in sharply lower sales 
rates in october 
in turn that colored mondays yeartoyear early october 
comparisons gms car sales were up 159 percent while those of 
ford which didnt offer incentives like gm did last year dropped 
238 percent 
through oct 10 of this year sales of cars and trucks by the 
big three were running 81 percent behind last years pace with 
car sales down 104 percent and truck sales off 44 percent 
ford said its early october car sales fell 172 percent and 
truck sales were down 238 percent combining for a 213 percent 
decline in vehicle sales the companys yeartodate car and truck 
sales were down 91 percent 
gm said its vehicle sales were up 133 percent over last year 
in addition to the 159 percent increase in car sales gms light 
truck sales were up 73 percent 
gms car and truck sales so far this year were running 5 percent 
behind last years pace 
chrysler said its combined car and truck sales for early october 
were 108 percent lower than last year with car sales rising 26 
percent and truck sales dropping 26 percent the companys vehicle 
sales so far this year were 146 percent behind last years pace

after a year of testmarketing a highcaffeine 
soft drink pepsicola co evidently has woken up and smelled the 
coffee 
the no 2 beverage maker behind cocacola co says it has 
stopped testing its extrakick pepsi am although pepsi will 
continue to test a marketing strategy aimed at luring coffee 
drinkers to its regular cola in the morning 
pepsicola had begun testing pepsi am in august 1989 in 
waterloo iowa but decided to discontinue the beverage this past 
august company spokeswoman leigh curtin said monday there are no 
immediate plans to brink the drink back 
what we found from the test was we didnt need to reformulate 
our product for consumers to enjoy it in the morning curtin 
said 
pepsi am had about 25 percent more caffeine than regular 
pepsi the compny wanted to see if the added jolt would attract 
coffee drinkers but sales proved slow and some iowa consumers said 
the beverage tasted flat 
while the test has ended pepsi has not given up on converting 
coffee drinkers to its soft drinks in the morning said another 
pepsi spokeswoman rebecca madeira 
she said a promotional test begun in august 1989 in fort wayne 
ind is continuing using the slogan pepsi in the morning for 
its regular cola 
cocacola also has used periodic promotions in some markets that 
pitched its regular soft drinks for consumption in the morning 
industry experts say the percentage of soft drinks consumed in 
the morning has risen to 15 percent of all soda sales from 10 
percent a decade ago an important increase because each 1 percent 
share of the market represents more than 400 million in retail 
sales 
coffee consumption meanwhile has shown signs of declining 
though it remains one of the prevalent wakeup beverages in the 
country 
we think there is a lot of potential there to expand ms 
madeira said

on balance sheets

equivalent of 503 a share in the quarter ended sept 30 compared 
with a 111 billion loss which equaled 1245 a share a year

state attorney general robert abrams on monday 
announced a settlement with 12 car manufacturers that will provide 
up to 100 million in refunds to consumers 
the settlement was reached under the states lemon law and 
could set a precedent for other states officials said abrams said 
he believes it to be the largest refund by automakers in the 
nations history 
the settlement will provide refunds for all new york residents 
who bought or leased new cars after aug 2 1986 and have been 
forced to pay for repairs that should have been covered by 
warranty 
the repairs must have been made after the manufacturers basic 
warranty expired normally during the first 12 months or 12000 
miles whichever comes first but before the first 24 months or 
18000 miles or whichever comes first 
the states lemon law requires manufacturers and their dealers 
to make repairs under their warranty at no cost to the customer 
for a period of two years or 18000 miles whichever comes first 
the carmakers who entered into the agreement are chrysler ford 
general motors honda hyundai isuzu mazda mitsubishi nissan 
subaru toyota and volvo each company also paid the state 10000 
in costs for a total of 120000 but they did not admit 
wrongdoing in signing the settlement 
some carmakers such as mercedesbenz were not included in the 
settlement because their warranty programs are broader than the 
states lemon law abrams said 
abrams said the settlement was reached after a longfought 
effort of four years to get the auto manufacturers to agree on 
the terms 
within the next month the automakers will place advertisements 
in major new york newspapers detailing the refund plan the ads 
will run for six weeks and consumers have 4 months to respond 
what happens in new york becomes very important to the rest of 
the nation and we may see other states taking a look at this 
abrams said 
since the states lemon law was expanded in 1986 a record 60 
million has been recovered on behalf of consumers abrams said

mr keating is innocent he believes in his innocence hes 
confident that when the evidence is developed he will be 
vindicated 
keating 66 remained jailed monday on 5 million bail after 
superior court judge lance ito set a tentative trial date of nov 
26 
keating and three others are accused of defrauding investors 
with american continental junk bonds sold through the now defunct

american continental which owned lincoln 
also in court monday were keatings codefendants all of whom 
are free on bail they are ray c fidel 32 former lincoln 
president robin s symes 37 former lincoln chief executive 
officer and judy wischer 42 former american continental 
president 
each of the four defendents is charged with 42 counts of fraud 
and could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of six or more 
counts

federal court after losing similar bids in state appeals courts 
the bespectacled keating was permitted to change from his prison 
uniform into slacks and an opencollared beige shirt before 
entering the courtroom where he listened to the proceedings with a 
slight smile 
ito scheduled a motions hearing oct 26

romania will devalue its national 
currency by almost half and lift subsidies on most consumer goods 
beginning nov 1 a government official said monday 
economics minister eugen dijmarescu said in an interview that 
the government had decided to devalue the romanian leu from the 
current official rate of 20 to the dollar to 35 to the dollar 
the government also plans to replace the leu with a new currency 
early next year according to official sources 
romanians will be able to change their lei still emblazoned 
with the socialist emblems of nicolae ceausesacus former 
dictatorship for the asyetunnamed new currency at a rate of 
10toone the sources said 
officials said the measures should help the leu become fully 
convertible help attract foreign investment and help romanias 
devastated economy adjust to free market practices after four 
decades of communist central planning 
the government also hopes the devaluation will stimulate exports 
and redress a spiralling trade deficit observers said 
dijmarescu said the new measures will enable the leu to achieve 
convertibility sooner than initially thought possible western 
observers say at least three years will be needed for full 
convertibility 
he said subsidies will be lifted nov 1 on most consumer goods 
but prices of staples such as bread meat and electricity would 
remain fixed to protect low wage earners from the inflationary 
effects of the liberalization package

a consumer group said monday that five of the 
nations top 20 property and casualty insurance companies would be 
threatened with insolvency in the event of a severe economic 
downturn 
spokesmen for four of the firms took issue with the report by 
the ralph nader organization public citizen and said the companies 
are healthy comment was not immediately available from the fifth 
firm 
they either used the wrong facts or they got the wrong 
numbers said howard smith senior vice president and comptroller 
for the american international group 
in addition to aig the companies listed as potentially at risk 
were aetna the hartford liberty mutual and united states fidelity 
amp guaranty 
although during the present high phase of the insurance 
cycle none of these companies are on the edge of insolvency the 
underlying weakness in their financial condition is clearly 
evident the consumer group said 
shawn mooney senior vice president of the insurance information 
institute called the study irresponsible you can precipitate a 
run on a company by putting out statements that such and such a 
company is in bad financial shape he said 
public citizen president joan claybrook said she would not advse 
people holding policies with any of the companies to change to 
another insurer but she said they should write to their companies 
and urge corrective action 
the study analyzed six factors that it said could cause 
companies to fail during a downturn in the insurance business it 
said the five companies were each vulnerable to four of the 
factors 
the 124page report analyzed shrinking surpluses the ratio of 
surplus to losses and unusually wide premium swings over the years 
1969 to 1988 
three shortterm factors were also examined the amount of risk 
the company insures compared with the size of its cushion against 
unexpected losses the degree to which its investments could be 
converted into cash and the extent of its investment in highrisk 
junk bonds 
joyce willis a spokeswoman for the hartford insurance group 
said hartford rates high in assessments by credible agencies it 
would surprise me that suddenly someone else could come in and use 
what appear to be similar criteria and announce that we are 
vulnerable she said 
ms claybrook said public citizen believes the standards used by 
the national association of insurance commissioners a commonly 
accepted rating group for insurers are not tough enough 
her groups report said a combination of low premium volume 
high claims and weak return on investment could mean potential 
financial trouble for the companies it said all of these factors 
occur during an insurance cycle downturn 
the failure of just one insurance giant would overwhelm the 
state funds designed to protect policyholders ms claybrook 
said the result could be another taxpayer bailout on the model 
of the savings and loan industry 
smith of aig said he was flabbergasted that his institution 
would be considered vulnerable he said aig had a 17 percent return 
on equity in last years annual report plus the highest premium 
volume of any commercial writer in the country and our cash flow 
continues to be exceptionally strong 
jonathan powell a spokesman for aetna called the five firms 
named by public citizen very strong companies and said he was 
astounded that the consumer group would find otherwise whit 
lancaster manager of corporate communications for liberty mutual 
labeled the report absurd and reckless 
other firms included in the survey were allstate cignaina 
chubb cna continental crum amp forster farmers firemans fund 
kemper lincoln nationwide st paul state farm travelers and 
usaa only allstate and state farm failed to register any of the 
potential danger signals the study said 
public citizen recommended several steps to ease the problems it 
found among them are repeal of the mccarranferguson act that 
exempts insurers from antitrust laws use of the racketeer 
influence and corrupt organizations law to prosecute fraud and 
wrongdoing by insurance executives use of more insurance tax 
dollars for regulation and a yearly federal report on the 
effectiveness of state regulation

crude oil price hikes hampered thirdquarter 
growth in the chemical industry a situation analysts say will 
worsen by the end of the year 
thirdquarter earnings are not yet out but chemical company 
stock prices have taken a beating because crude oil prices have 
nearly doubled since the persian gulf east crisis began 
companies with large chemical units like exxon corp chevron 
corp mobil corp and ei du pont de nemours amp co which owns 
conoco will offset their chemical earnings squeezes with higher 
profits from crude oil sales 
but companies that focus on chemicals have no crudeoil profit 
buffer 
makers of chemicals used in making a variety of plastics will be 
hit the worst analysts say because oil represents a large portion 
of their costs 
if conditions stay as they are its bound to be worse in the 
fourth quarter because a recession will follow said analyst 
leslie c ravitz with salomon brothers in new york 
companies that buy commodity chemicals and further refine them 
to make plastics are a little more insulated because a relatively 
smaller portion of their feedstock cost is directly related to the 
price of oil analysts say 
feedstock prices have gone up more quickly than product 
prices said earl armstrong a consultant for dewitt amp co a 
houston consulting firm that specializes in the chemical industry 
armstrong said prices for some refined products began catching 
up with the higher costs this month but most companies were forced 
to swallow the higher costs during the first month of the oil 
increase because of price protection clauses in supply agreements 
that require them to give manufacturers 30 days notice of an 
increase 
everybody got hurt pretty badly on the time lag armstrong 
said

polaroid corp reported monday that its 
third quarter earnings increased 5 percent over last year aided by 
strong international sales gains 
the firm said net earnings for the quarter were 313 million 
compared with 299 million for the same period last year total 
sales increased 6 percent in the quarter to 4637 million 
compared to 4377 million last year 
the earnings report followed news on friday that us district 
judge a david mazzone had ordered eastman kodak co to pay 
polaroid 9095 million in damages and interest for infringing on 
seven polaroid patents mazzone said the infringement was not 
willful and declined to award the 12 billion polaroid had sought 
in punitive damages 
us sales were down 6 percent for the quarter ending sept 30 
while international sales increased 27 percent the firm attributed 
the gains to strong international sales aided by a weaker dollar 
higher unit sales also contributed to the increased margins but 
were offset by higher marketing costs resulting in a 5 percent 
drop in operating profit the firm said 
but profit before taxes increased due to lower interest expense 
i macallister booth president and chief executive officer 
said in a statement the firm remained committed to making the 
marketing product development and capital expenditures necessary 
to support sales and to secure our competitive position in the 
growing imaging marketplace of the future 
the third quarter earnings reflected those investments booth 
said 
for 1990 operating profits were expected to be flat or slightly 
down from last year reflecting the uncertainties of the us 
business climate and continued investments in product development 
booth said 
polaroid supplies instant photography cameras and films as 
well as conventional films videotapes and electronic visual 
communication products to family business and technical and 
industrial markets

energy futures prices declined in active but 
calm trading monday as the market sensed some easing of tensions in 
the persian gulf 
a drop in refinery demand for crude oil contributed to the 
slide 
the november contract for delivery of light sweet crude fell 
174 to 3795 a 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange after dropping 73 cents on friday 
analysts said trading was influenced by a soviet report that 
iraqi president saddam hussein might be willing to withdraw his 
troops from kuwait in return for some kuwaiti land bordering the 
persian gulf 
peter beutel an oil market analyst with pegasus econometric 
group inc said the market believed tensions were lessening 
somewhat if that is the case the likelihood of war would be 
reduced and so would a cutoff in oil supplies from the gulf 
however the situation in the gulf and the market remained 
touchandgo tomorrow morning may be a completely different 
story beutel warned 
abundant supplies of crude oil and refined products also helped 
bring prices down monday 
the november contract for home heating oil tumbled 329 cents to 
10207 a gallon while wholesale unleaded regular gasoline slipped 
218 cents to 9495 cents a gallon both contracts advanced on 
friday 
refiners are currently retooling their equipment to turn out 
more heating oil and less gasoline for the winter months this 
seasonal lull reduces the need for crude and with traders feeling 
more optimistic about the middle east situation allows 
supplyanddemand forces to have an impact on trading 
beutel said technical forces were also at work in the market 
monday under current conditions refiners are not willing to pay 
40 and more per barrel for oil and are balking at the higher 
prices he said 
in natural gas trading the november contract closed at 1900 
per 1000 cubic feet down from 1950 on friday

silver prices hit new 14year lows monday and gold plunged to 
its lowest level since before iraq invaded kuwait reflecting new 
hopes for peace in the middle east and skepticism in the investment 
value of precious mtals 
on other commodity markets oil futures fell nearterm orange 
juice rebounded grains and soybeans were lower and livestock and 
meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 1250 to 1420 lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for spot delivery at 375 an 
ounce the lowest spot gold price since aug 1 
silver futures ended 174 cents to 199 cents lower on the comex 
with october at 4132 a troy ounce platinum plunged 2280 to 23 
on the new york mercantile exchange where the october contract 
ended at 39410 a troy ounce platinums first drop below 400 
since early 1986 
analysts said the selloff was partly triggered by a sharp drop 
in petroleum prices that was in turn prompted by a soviet press 
report that iraqi leader saddam hussein might withdraw his troops 
from kuwait in exchange for some kuwaiti territory on the persian 
gulf 
but analysts said the slide in gold silver and platinum also 
was an indication that more and more investors no longer view 
precious metals as desirable assets in times of economic and 
political uncertainty 
although the market is not following its traditional path 
its hard to imagine a scenario more bullish for precious 
metals than the current situation said frederick demler metals 
analyst at painewebber inc 
ten years ago we would have seen gold at 500 or 600 he 
said 
analyst william oneill of merrill lynch futures said gold and 
platinumproducing countries such as the soviet union and south 
africa were heavy sellers of those metals monday 
mondays lower oil prices also were linked to expectations that 
us consumption of crude oil has begun to weaken on a seasonal 
basis as refineries retool to produce more heating oil and less 
gasoline said peter beutel energy analyst with the pegasus 
econometric group of hoboken nj 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 57 cents to 174 lower on 
the new york mercantile exchange with november at 3795 a barrel 
heating oil was 217 cents to 329 cents lower with november at 
10207 a gallon unleaded gasoline was 155 cents to 27 cents 
lower with november at 9495 cents a gallon 
frozen concentrated orange juice for november delivery rose 45 
cents to 11795 a pound on the new york cotton exchange 
rebounding from a loss of 1645 cents friday 
all other orange juice contracts fell their permitted daily 
limit of 5 cents though in a continued reaction to a government 
report that predicted a bumper florida orange crop 
harvest pressure helped push most grain and soybean futures 
prices lower monday on the chicago board of trade 
analysts said dry weekend weather in the midwest allowed farmers 
to get back into their fields to resume the soybean and corn 
harvest which was stalled by heavy rains early last week 
an agriculture department report released after the close showed 
the soybean harvest 40 percent complete and the corn harvest 32 
percent complete as of sunday the progress rate was below average 
for both crops 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 265 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 228 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to cent higher with december at 120 a bushel 
soybeans were 6 cents lower to 1 cents higher with november at 
614 a bushel 
cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange pork futures ended mostly lower led by the pork belly 
market which erased limit gains amid expectations for sharply 
lower cash prices next week

government bond prices closed slightly higher 
monday after a listless session 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond gained 732 point or 
219 per 1000 in face amount its yield which falls when prices 
rise slipped to 893 percent from 895 percent late friday 
it has been an extraordinarily quiet day said susan hering 
a treasury bond economist at salomon brothers inc 
government bond prices rose slightly when the market opened 
after rising overseas then slipped slightly and remained at 
virtually the same level the rest of the day 
ms hering said the market had almost no reaction to news that 
auto sales dropped 48 percent in the first 10 days of october i 
think people were expecting them to be weak so that diffused the 
impact she said 
often a sign of growing economic weakness boosts bond prices 
because it makes it more likely the federal reserve will ease 
interest rates 
a dip in oil prices also had little impact she added usually 
bond prices rise on signs that inflationary pressures may be 
easing inflation is a major concern of bond investors since it 
devalues the fixedreturn securities 
ms hering said she believed bond investors were awaiting the 
results of the ongoing budget negotiations in washington and the 
release thursday of september consumer price figures 
also monday interest rates on shortterm treasury securities 
sold at auction were virtually unchanged 
the treasury sold 94 billion in threemonth bills at an 
average discount rate of 718 percent down from 719 percent last 
week another 94 billion was sold in sixmonth bills at an 
average discount rate of 722 percent up from 721 percent last 
week 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were unchanged to 332 point higher intermediate 
maturities rose from 116 point to 532 point and longterm issues 
were up as much as 732 point according to telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 123 to 114799 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 737 percent as the 
discount rose 2 basis points to 716 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 754 percent as the discount rate rose 4 basis points 
to 718 percent yields on oneyear bills remained at 756 percent 
as the discount stood at 708 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent up from 7 
percent late friday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively

ibm said monday its thirdquarter profit jumped 
almost 27 percent despite the economic downturn and persistent 
sluggishness in the computer industry 
however wall street did not cheer the news and sent ibms stock 
price down 1 to close at 9925 in new york stock exchange 
trading 
from what had been anticipated this was on the low side 
analyst stephen cohen of soundview finanical group inc in 
stamford conn said of the earnings 
international business machines corp said profit for the three 
months ended sept 30 totaled 111 billion or 195 a share up 
from 877 million or 151 a share in the same quarter last year 
revenue at the worlds largest computer company rose nearly 7 
percent to 1528 billion from 1430 billion in the yearago 
period 
analysts expressed concern partly because ibm declined to say 
how much its results benefited from the lower value of the dollar 
during the quarter 
ibm derives more than half its revenue and profit outside the 
united states a weaker dollar means overseas sales translate into 
better results in dollar terms because of this analysts want to 
know whether the benefits of the weaker dollar are masking any 
underlying trouble 
in a conference call with analysts ibm said it gained from the 
dollars decline but would not elaborate 
cohen estimated the boost amounted to 30 cents out of the 195 
in pershare earnings in addition about 5 cents came from lower 
federal tax rates this year with this in mind he said 195 
does not look like that big a number 
ibms product sales slipped 15 percent to 901 billion but 
revenue from support services software equipment rental and 
financing posted doubledigit increases over the yearearlier 
quarter 
ibm based in suburban armonk told analysts that sales of 
personal computers were unchanged during the third quarter while 
this came as little surprise analysts said it presented one more 
worry as the economy declines 
ibm also told analysts that revenue from mainframe computers was 
not as robust as other products because of the transition to the 
new system390 mainframe line announced in september ibm said it 
hasnt been able to meet demand for the powerful newgeneration 
machines crimping revenue said john jones an analyst at 
montgomery securities inc in san francisco 
jones called the decline in ibms stock price a bearmarket 
knee jerk 
some people may have hoped that ibm would come through with a 
big surprise he said 
in a statement ibm chairman john f akers said the company was 
seeing the benefits of a costcutting plan announced late last 
year the restructuring which includes the elimination of about 
10000 jobs and plant consolidations was prompted by the computer 
industry slowdown 
our portfolio of products and services which is the strongest 
in our history and our geographic diversity are serving us well 
akers said assuming no further deterioration in the worlds 
economies we continue to expect substantially improved financial 
performance for 1990 
for the years first nine months ibm reported a profit of 356 
billion or 621 a share up 12 percent from 317 billion or 
543 a share in the 1989 period 
revenue for the nine months totaled 460 billion up almost 9percent 
from 422 billion in the same period a year earlier 
meanwhile monday ncr corp another major computer maker said 
profit slipped 3 percent in the third quarter due to a 
sharerepurchase program 
ncr based in dayton ohio said it earned 91 million or 136 
a share down from from 94 million or 123 a share in the 
yearearlier quarter 
revenue rose 9 percent to a record 152 billion from 139 
billion a year earlier 
ncr said it repurchased 22 million common shares during the 
quarter under a continuing stock buyback program that increased 
earnings per share while decreasing net income it said 
for the first nine months profit was 258 million or 373 a 
share a 3 percent decrease from 265 million or 340 a share a 
year earlier 
revenue increased 5 percent to 439 billion from last years 
417 billion 
charles e exley jr ncrs chairman and chief executive said 
the company didnt expect profit to increase for the entire year 
due to disappointing domestic orders in the second and third 
quarters

united airlines announced plans monday to buy as 
many as 128 new boeing aircraft to rejuvenate and expand its fleet 
in an order worth at least 11 billion and potentially a record 22 
billion or more 
the deal includes boeings new 777 model the firstever order 
for that plane and represented a significant coup for boeing over 
its leading competitors mcdonnell douglas corp and airbus 
industrie of europe 
it also came a week after a protracted employee effort to buy 
united failed and seemed to signify an attempt by one of the 
nations leading airlines to refocus attention on its longterm 
competitive position 
this purchase will allow united to replace older aircraft as 
well as expand both its domestic and international services said 
stephen wolf chairman of chicagobased ual corp uniteds parent 
company 
in short it will ensure that this company is positioned to 
compete aggressively around the world wolf said 
the agreement includes firm orders for 34 boeing model 777s and 
30 boeing 747400s with a total value of about 11 billion 
in addition united has the option to purchase an additional 34 
model 777s and 30 model 747400s if all those options were 
excercised the total value of the purchase would swell to at least 
22 billion and make it the largest order in history 
for united customers wolf said the order means more service 
to more destinations in the worlds newest most modern and 
efficient aircraft 
for our shareholders it means more revenue growth to be 
reflected in increased shareholder value 
wolf declined to discuss plans for financing the order but he 
said it wouldnt affect employee contract negotiations 
we dont intend to ask them to make concessons to pay for the 
fleet he said we anticipate raises 
wolf said the expansion provides a sense of security for 
uniteds 74000 employees 
united said it chose pratt amp whitney 4000 engines to power the 
aircraft assembly on the 777s is to start in late 1992 as they 
are delivered united said they will replace the companys dc10 
aircraft on domestic routes and provide expansion capacity 
delivery of the 747400 aircraft would start in 1994 a number 
of 747400s from a previous order are expected before that and will 
be used for continued expansion of uniteds international market 
wolf said the company would more than double its service to 
europe in 1991 by adding destinations 
a large united purchase had been expected for some time 
although the uncertainty of the buyout negotiations with employees 
had raised questions about the timing and size it was well known 
throughout the industry that boeing airbus and mcdonnell douglas 
were competing aggressively for the order 
the importance of todays commitment for boeing cannot be 
overstated frank shrontz boeings chairman and chief executive 
officer said in a statement from the aircraft makers seattle 
headquarters 
with a ratification by boeings board on oct 29 this order 
will launch an allnew 777 aircraft family which will set a new 
standard for very large twinengine operations around the world 
boeing commercial airplane group spokesman richard schleh said 
the 777 designed to fill a market niche between the 747400 and 
the existing 767300 widebody will be 209 feet long and have a 
wingspan of 197 feet uniteds 777s will seat 363 passengers 
boeing plans to build the 777 at its everett wash widebody 
plant north of seattle schleh said it now has about 3400 
employees working on the plane 
shrontz said the buildup in the 777 program will mean 8000 to 
10000 jobs but not all will be new jobs he said because some 
will come from other company operations 
like other leading airlines united has been seeking to 
replenish its fleet with younger airplanes that are more fuel 
efficient and require less costly maintenance than their aging 
predecessors 
the latest order is uniteds third in 18 months uniteds last 
aircraft order for 370 narrowbody boeing jetliners was in april 
1989 
ual spokeswoman sara dornacker said the average age of uniteds 
fleet was 127 years at the end of august compared with 136 years 
a year earlier 
the largest order in the industry excluding options to purchase 
aircraft is 168 billion made in april 1989 by an irelandbased 
aircraft leasing company gpa group ltd it ordered a total of 308 
planes from boeing airbus industrie and mcdonnell douglas 
united had come close to placing its widebody aircraft order 
earlier this year but postponed the plans in july at the request of 
uals unions which were then still in the midst of leading an 
attempt to buy the airline 
last week the employees failed to get bank financing for a 44 
billion bid prompting uals board to reject their offer

monday unveiled a lowercost line of its popular macintosh 
machines tempting consumers but worrying investors and dealers 
apple priced the macintosh classic at about 1000 the 
macintosh lc at 2500 and the macintosh iisi starting at about 
3800 however shoppers can expect better deals after retailers 
discount the products experts say 
we are prepared to do whatever it takes to reach more people 
with macintosh said brodie keast an apple product marketing 
manager the plan is to get as aggressive on price as we need to 
be 
analysts said the strategy will work only if the cupertinobased 
company sells enough computers to offset the smaller profit margins 
on them 
the risks are making investors jittery that apple wont be able 
to make changes necessary to thrive on lower margins apples stock 
closed monday at 2775 a share in national overthecounter 
trading down 50 cents from friday and well off its 12month high 
of 5037 
the new computers unveiled at apples factory in fremont also 
are raising concerns among apples 1700 authorized dealers they 
worry that they ultimately will lose business if apple in its 
effort to boost sales recruits more dealers or sells through 
retail outlets previously shunned analysts said 
clearly this is something apple is evaluating said walter 
j winnitzki an analyst for the brokerage firm brown brothers 
harriman amp co in new york 
the base macintosh classic available immediately comes with 1 
megabyte of memory and a floppy disk drive another version for 
about 500 more offers 2 megabytes of memory and a 40megabyte hard

the air line pilots association is opening a 
longplanned television and radio campaign to burnish its members 
professional image in the immediate aftermath of the conviction of 
three pilots for flying while drunk 
the campaign theme safety is a daily commitment 
the 250000 cost to buy air time for the commercials was paid 
for by individual contributions from 2500 pilots said capt henry 
duffy president of the association thats also the pilots labor 
union 
although the advertising campaign was conceived two years ago 
it follows widespread negative publicity from the arrest and 
conviction of three northwest airline pilots for intoxication while 
flying 
one of them testified he had consumed up to 20 rum and diet 
cokes at a lounge the night before piloting a flight from fargo 
nd to minneapolisst paul international airport 
we go quickly by 19000 successes and focus on an occasional 
slip duffy said referring to the number of flights safely 
concluded each day in the united states 
pilots have the feeling that there is no understanding of how 
much training they undergo of how many checks they are subject to 
and how many physicals theyve had to take he said 
i think any time the media focuses on some negative aspect of 
the aviation industry there are going to be questions in the public 
mind duffy said we want to balance that with the high level 
of competence in the cockpits 
duffy said the associations image enhancement campaign was 
prompted by concerns expressed by many of the 42000 pilots who 
belong to the association 
pilots themselves arent at all good in being their own pr 
agents duffy said no matter how skillful a feat of airmanship 
a pilot performs youll usually only hear him or her say i was 
just doing my job 
the television commercial will be aired 150 times on cnn 
headline news from oct 22 to nov 18 and is aimed duffy said at 
business travelers our key target audience 
it also will be shown on the late evening news in miami 
chicago minneapolis pittsburgh and atlanta 
the radio commercial will be broadcast beginning the week of 
oct 22 with sponsorship of games 4 5 and 6 of the world series on 
the cbs radio network it also will be aired on the mutual radio 
network during college and professional football shows talk shows 
and news reports 
the 30second television commercial cuts from the cockpit where 
the crew calmly carries out its duties to the cabin where a little 
girl plays with a teddy bear and naps 
the narrator more than a million people rely on us every day 
it takes experience ability and dedication to be a professional 
airline pilot

a huge order monday from united airlines 
gave the boeing co the goahead for its new 777 jetliner a plane 
boeing hopes will be the basis of a new hightech family of 
aircraft for the early 21st century 
the twinengine plane slightly smaller than a 747 jumbo jet is 
the first allnew aircraft to be launched by boeing since 1978 to 
build the jet boeing plans to add as many as 6500 more jobs in 
the seattle area over the next four years 
united ordered 34 of the jets and took options on another 34 as 
part of a 128plane order potentially worth more than 22 billion 
united also bought 30 boeing 747400s and optioned 30 more in what 
would be the largest commercial aircraft purchase in history if all 
options are exercised 
at a news conference chris longridge boeing commercial 
airplane group executive vice president for sales called the order 
mindboggling 
the total value of all boeings announced orders in 1987 was 
199 billion a company record at the time he noted 
longridge said boeing already is talking about building a 
family of 777 aircraft and has proposed a version that could 
haul 300320 people up to 7600 miles the next logical step would 
be a stretch version to carry more than 400 passengers longridge 
said adding that some operators have been talking to us about 
that 
boeing designed the 777 to fill a market niche between its 
767300 and 747 widebodies 
its big it will seat 360390 passengers in two classes 
compared to a 747400 which holds 412 people in three classes 
at 209 feet the 777wwill be about 23 feet shorter than a 747 
but its body will be 2 inches wider at 20 feet 4 inches and its 
197foot wingspan 2 feet more than the jumbo jets each engine 
will be 20 percent more powerful than those of a 747 and large 
enough to swallow the body of a midsized jetliner 
the most visible change from previous models will be the folding 
wingtips that will allow the jet to use airport gates now used by 
midsized planes 
but the plane will have an allnew wing and fuelstingy engines 
that alan mulally vice president of engineering for boeings new 
airplane division says will make it 30 percent to 40 percent more 
fuelefficent than existing dc10s and l1011s 
to save weight the plane will make extensive use of composite 
materials rather than metal 
airlines today order jets 10 years in advance and expect to fly 
them another 20 years after that for that reason mulally said 
boeings potential customers wanted the 777 design to be as 
flexible as possible 
the 777 will be plumbed and wired to allow galleys and 
lavatories for different seating patterns seats can be placed 
anywhere from five to 10 abreast 
the 777 will have a range of up to 4800 statute miles that 
compares with the longrange 767300 which can carry 261 
passengers in mixed classes 7200 miles and the 747400 the 
worlds largest commercial jet which can fly 8000 miles 
three japanese companies mitsubishi heavy industries kawasaki 
heavy industries and fuji heavy industries will build large 
portions of the planes fuselage the companies also build part of 
the 767 
longridge said the 777 program eventually will employ 8000 to 
10000 people with assembly at boeings everett widebody plant 
about 3400 are working on it now boeing which has about 100000 
workers in the seattle area has been trimming its workforce and 
the new jobs could offset that somewhat he said 
although its introduced several variations of existing models 
the last allnew planes boeing brought out were the midsized 757 
and the 767 in 1978 
united and boeing struck their deal sunday night longridge 
said after the airline heard lastminute presentations by boeing 
and competitors mcdonnell douglas corp and airbus industrie 
united long was rumored to be the initial 777 customer the 
company postponed its order last july at the request of its unions 
which were making an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to buy the 
carrier 
longridge said boeing is discussing possible 777 sales with 
american airlines delta airlines cathay pacific british airways 
qantas japan air lines and all nippon airways he said its likely 
all nippon could make its decision within the next few weeks

a judge on monday struck down state 
approval for northeast utilities to issue 500 million in bonds to 
help pay for its 23 billion takeover of bankrupt public service 
company of new hampshire 
merrimack county superior court judge kenneth mchugh said 
approval of the bonds by the state industrial development 
authority gov judd gregg and the executive council was 
arbitrary unreasonable and capricious 
he ordered the ida to hold a public hearing on the bond 
application 
the state is reviewing the ruling and has not decided whether to 
appeal 
mchugh issued his ruling on a complaint by the campaign for 
ratepayers rights which has opposed the seabrook nuclear plant 
built by public service and has fought electricity rate hikes 
planned to help pay for the 66 billion plant 
the executive council which is elected to review certain 
appropriations approved the pollutioncontrol bonds 50 several 
weeks ago on recommendation of the ida the bonds half of which 
are tax exempt are among a number of bond issues northeast 
utilities of berlin conn planned to use to finance its friendly 
takeover of psnh 
mchugh earlier rejected as premature a petition by the campaign 
and others to block the bonds but he said the court would review 
their claims before the bonds are issued 
mchugh ruled only on whether the public had been given a proper 
chance to participate in the ida decision 
utility and authority officials denied the allegation they said 
they had reviewed the process carefully and were confident of its 
legality

winnebago industries incs bottom line 
improved in the most recent quarter but the motor home company 
still had a 38 million loss on sagging sales 
the market for recreational vehicles has been sent into a 
tailspin by soaring gasoline prices and fears of a recession a 
combination that leaves consumers reluctant to spend 27000 and up 
on a motor home 
the quarterly loss was winnebagos fifth consecutive 
the company recently offered gasoline rebates to new customers 
in an attempt to revive its slumping business 
winnebagos loss in the quarter ended aug 25 came to 15 cents a 
share compared with a loss of almost 113 million or 46 cents a 
share in the comparable quarter a year earlier revenue slipped 4 
percent to 859 million from 895 million 
for the full fiscal year the loss came to 178 million or 72 
cents a share and surpassed the previous record loss of 135 
million in fiscal 1980 another period when gas prices soared and 
the economy contracted a year ago winnebago had a loss of almost 
47 million or 19 cents a share revenue fell 234 percent on the 
year to 3351 million from 4375 million 
winnebago makes recreational and commercial vehicles and its 
cyclesat subsidiary delivers television commercials by satellite 
the fourth fiscal quarter loss was aggravated by a settlement of 
an internal revenue service audit that increased the net loss by 
23 million said fred dohrmann winnebagos chief operating 
officer 
results for the fiscal year were hurt by reduced sales volume 
for recreational vehicles and operating losses at the companys new 
commercial vehicle business and at cyclesat dohrmann said 
but he said the company had operating income from its 
recreational vehicle division in the fourth quarter of the fiscal 
year 
winnebago said it has been able to substantially increase sales 
volume of the winnebago warrior and itasca spirit micromini motor 
homes 
in an attempt to reassure customers spooked at the gas pump 
winnebago last week guaranteed to rebate gasoline expenses above 
999 cents a gallon for new motor homes purchased through the end 
of the year the rebates will be in effect for 12 months or 12000 
miles whichever comes first 
winnebago also laid off 1500 workers at forest city at the end 
of last month because of high inventories of unsold recreational 
vehicles on monday it called back 1000 workers but said there 
were no plans yet to bring back the remaining 500 idled workers
