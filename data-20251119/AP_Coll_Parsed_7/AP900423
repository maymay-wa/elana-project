republican gubernatorial nominee clayton williams 
who admitted during the weekend that he went to prostitutes as a 
youth said monday its time to put the past behind him and 
concentrate on the issues in the campaign 
im saying that ive not been a perfect man in my early days 
but im honest ive admitted that and im willing to talk about 
the issues now williams told reporters in midland during an 
appearance with his wife modesta 
it was williams first public statement on the controversy 
brought by a sunday houston post story in which he admitted that he 
frequented prostitutes in mexico as a youth and later as a student 
at texas aampm university 
mrs williams said monday that the youthful escapades did not 
bother her 
that was so long ago that was 35 or 40 years ago that was 
not part of our marriage weve had a very strong wonderful 
marriage what he did in his past it doesnt matter to me 
williams said he paid for sex in his youth because brothels 
were the only place you got serviced then 
he also has said hed be uncomfortable running against a woman 
because he grew up in a mans world and during gloomy weather 
on a cattle roundup with reporters present williams compared rape 
to bad weather saying if its inevitable just relax and enjoy 
it 
williams gaffes may be widening the gender gap in the texas 
governors race but political analysts say they wont necessarily 
hurt the west texas oilmans chances against democratic state 
treasurer ann richards in november 
its definitely going to be a gender race and hes chiseling 
away at the womens vote said karen ashmore a spokeswoman for 
the dallas chapters of the national organization for women and i 
think itll be down to nothing by november 
but george christian an austin political consultant doesnt 
think its that clear 
its hard to say whether one or two incidents have a 
devastating effect or not said christian who was lyndon 
johnsons white house press secretary its so far from the 
general election god knows whats going to come out by then at 
the rate its going 
i dont know who gets hurt and who gets helped ive never 
seen politics this way i dont know how to judge it he said 
ive never seen a man confess to what williams confessed to the 
other day 
christian said williams could undermine himself 
hes accessible and hes honest and were going find out 
whether thats refreshing or thats dangerous he said 
it may well be that people will act pretty positively to 
someone who is naive and is totally open said max sherman dean 
of the lyndon b johnson school of public affairs at the university 
of texas at austin 
it seems to me that williams probably is just a totally open 
person he says whats on his mind and hes continuing to do 
that as a candidate sherman said he doesnt try to hide the 
ball 
but ms ashmore said williams comments about prostitution were 
his third strike 
it has clearly shown an underlying chauvinistic attitude 
toward women it shows insensitivity to women and to issues that 
are of concern for women she said 
i think hes lost all the feminist vote and a feminist is 
anyone who believes in equality for women ms ashmore said i 
also think hes losing more of the mainstream republican women who 
were willing to give him a chance

who says dead men dont tell tales 
sam feigenbaum had many choice words for federal bureaucrats 
after an error listed him as deceased and cut off medicare and 
social security benefits 
feigenbaum 71 said he learned he was listed in social security 
administration computers as dead when he applied for 2860 in 
medicare payments for hospital tests in february also american 
savings was ordered to return about 2500 in social security 
benefits deposited in his account between july and february he 
said 
i begged the director of the bank dont send the money away 
i am not dead he said 
the confusion apparently stems from the death of feigenbaums 
wife sara in july they shared the same first initial and 
feigenbaums medicare claim number was identical except for the 
letter a at the end 
more than 700 has been returned to his bank account but it 
will take longer to make the correction in the main social security 
computer banks to pay doctor and hospital bills said social 
security branch manager mark spicker 
last week feigenbaum said he received another letter from 
medicare saying it will not pay his hospital bills 
its cheaper to send someone to check whether im alive than 
to send so many letters he said

smiling children skip along dirt 
paths kicking up radioactive dust they throw stones in their 
radioactive playground then go home for contaminated meat and milk 
since cesium strontium and plutonium descended on their 
rooftops gardens farms and schools four years ago the people of 
this byelorussian village and of scores more in the ukraine and 
russia have been prisoners of chernobyl 
they are surrounded and continously bombarded by an enemy they 
cannot see smell or hear they say their government and the world 
have all but forgotten them 
in bartolomeyevka another village a warm and hearty woman 
named tatiana t kharshunova said they did this to us and we 
had to live here not just for a month or two but four years no 
one paid attention to us 
she and her neighbors grow potatoes and barley in their gardens 
even though the radiation level is 40 curies nearly three times 
the danger level they can recite the figures like scientists but 
do not seem fully aware of the threat 
im as strong as a horse irina y kovoleva said she looked 
down at her 14monthold grandson in her arms and added hes 
strong too 
the boy and his parents were scheduled to be evacuated the next 
day 
ill cry when they leave the grandmother said the 
cemetery is nearby so ill die and go there 
nadezhda n dmitrochenko of the local governing council said she 
tries to explain the dangers of radiation but people still dont 
know what this is it doesnt glow and it doesnt whistle 
on april 26 1986 an explosion and fire destroyed one of four 
reactors at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the ukraine 125 
miles southwest of noviye gromyki 
as the children of the village played on a sunny april day four 
years later chickens and cats darted among the green and brown 
wooden huts 
the only sounds were chickens clucking dogs barking and the 
distant roar of tractors plowing contaminated fields in the vast 
fertile plain traversed by a creek 
the official death toll from chernobyl remains at 31 but a 
soviet newspaper said last fall it had risen to 250 scientists 
still predict thousands of deaths will be traceable to the accident 
after years of passivity the people affected are speaking out 
residents of gomel the provincial capital plan a strike and 
demonstration thursday the anniversary to protest official 
handling of what the government newspaper izvestia called the 
greatest technological catastrophe in world history 
citizens of kiev the ukrainian capital 80 miles south of 
chernobyl also plan demonstratons a telethon to raise money for 
victims is scheduled in moscow 
protesters demand that officials who concealed the extent of the 
danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas be brought to 
trial they want medical care for victims and supplies of 
radiationfree food 
about 70 percent of the chernobyl radiation fell on byelorussia 
and contaminated onefifth of the arable land an area twice the 
size of massachusetts where 22 million people live 
immediately after the accident about 25000 byelorussians were 
evacuated but only last year did officials admit the full scope of 
the contamination and decide to resettle more than 100000 more 
the resettlement will take five years and people eat and breathe 
nuclear poison in the meantime 
the program appears poorly run some evacuees are being 
resettled on land that also is contaminated and the government is 
building new homes schools and offices in areas that are being 
evacuated 
most families with young children have been moved out of noviye 
gromyki since resettlement began jan 1 
those still waiting feel abandoned and frightened they cannot 
move on their own because housing must be found for them 
we sit and cry said claudia a kostochka 75 who was on a 
bench with two other women sobbing they wont take us were 
pensioners 
i lived almost a whole century here raised a son and daughter 
here two weeks ago they closed our store so were eating cabbage 
and cucumber preserves from last year we dont know whether its 
dangerous or not but we have to eat 
a farmer said the milk from his cows was too radioactive to 
drink so he sells it to the government which makes it into 
butter he said the butter was supposed to be safe 
many others interviewed said they drank the milk because there 
was no alternative as many more said they did not bother to have 
their home produce checked at a local radiation laboratory 
soil and dust carry radioactive particles 
the only paved surfaces in noviye gromyki are one street and the 
grade school playground at no 13 lenin street winds blow dust 
from the dirt roads and fields onto the asphalt and the people and 
into their homes 
residents are warned not to gather firewood from the highly 
radioactive forests nearby burning it makes their stoves into what 
specialists have called minireactors 
villagers are supposed to wash frequently but they are allowed 
only one bar of soap a month the same as anyone else soap is 
rationed in most of the country 
each household gets 30 rubles a month from the government to buy 
uncontaminated food but it is hard to find thirty rubles are 
worth 49 at the official exchange rate but much less in reality 
in vetka a few miles south of novoyi gromyki children are fed 
clean meals at high school no 1 and the crumbling cement 
floors are washed several times a day 
outside their protection against radiation consists of paved 
playground and a 6inchhigh concrete barrier to keep them off the 
sidewalk where contaminated dirt falls from the roof students are 
supposed to rinse their shoes in a pan of water at the school 
entrance but many dont 
several students said they ignored warnings and rode mopeds in 
the forest they complained of headaches and exhaustion which they 
blamed on fallout 
to the list of ailments the chernobyl generation suffers school 
principal nikolai n shatilo added bloody noses swollen thyroid 
glands and vision loss the radiation level at high school no 1 is 
two to three times normal 
we cant provide normal conditions in school he said 
theres only one thing to do take them to a clean zone we must 
save the children they are our future 
one student said she was bitter because no one seemed to care 
not even the doctors who examine her class twice a year 
a 16yearold boy said were sick and tired of all the 
checkups what are they for all they do is keep saying 
everythings normal

dean kahler hugged the grass of the practice 
football field bullets were ricocheting off the blacktop road no 
more than 40 feet away 
oh my god theyre firing he said to himself 
then a sudden sting not much more than a pin prick at his back 
it was the only pain he felt he would never walk again 
a bullet fired through jeffrey millers mouth and skull slammed 
him to the ground as his blood pooled along a concrete curb a 
14yearold runaway knelt over him in anguish her arms flung 
skyward her face contorted in bewildered terror 
a 13second fusillade by national guardsmen turned antiwar 
dissent into disaster on a may monday 20 years ago at kent state 
university 
four students were killed and nine others wounded stunning a 
nation already fragmented by five years of a distant conflict 
by april 1970 more than 100 young americans and probably 
thousands of vietnamese north and south were dying each week in 
distant jungles and rice paddies but now the war had claimed 
victims at home four kids on a bluecollar campus amid the 
pancakeflat farmfields of ohio 
even so a gallup poll taken for newsweek within days of the 
shootings indicated that 58 percent of the public blamed the 
demonstrators and backed the ohio guardsmen the mourning parents 
received hate mail 
almost three more years would pass before the united states 
ended its military role in vietnam although some families of the 
dead believe the kent state killings hastened that end 
i believe the war in vietnam was brought to a quicker close 
because of it said florence schroeder of lorain ohio whose 
19yearold son william died that day that is our only reason 
to have ever filed the lawsuits to make sure the event gets its 
proper historical significance 
the significance of dead students on american soil was powerful 
dissent against us involvement in vietnam had built slowly since 
combat troops were sent in march 1965 but by 1970 campuses were 
in turmoil over the increasingly unpopular war 
president richard nixon was seen as the villain and he returned 
the sentiment in kind the president assailed the more vocal 
antiwar protesters as bums his vice president spiro agnew 
suggested in april that universities deal with their protesters 
like nazis the next time a mob of students waving their 
nonnegotiable demands starts pitching bricks and rocks at the 
student union just imagine they are wearing brown shirts or white 
sheets and act accordingly 
adding to the boiling tension was the fact that every young 
mans birthday was potentially a ticket to vietnam from 1969 to 
1973 the military draft was a lottery based on birth dates 
the black cloud of vietnam and the draft were hanging over 
their heads said kahler then a 20yearold freshman and 
conscientious objector from canton ohio 
thomas lough was one of many professors who felt they didnt 
dare give a male student a failing grade that would kill him 
said lough who teaches sociology at kent state theyd be 
eligible for selective service if they were flunked out of school 
their lives were on the line 
on april 30 student dissenters around the country listened in 
disbelief as nixon announced on nationwide television the invasion 
of neutral cambodia by us troops bent on destroying communist 
border sanctuaries 
just the previous july nixon had begun a phased withdrawal and 
tens of thousands of american men were already back home now 
americans were fighting on a new front some students had lost 
brothers and childhood friends in the war they didnt want to kill 
or to be killed protests broke out at onethird of the nations 
2500 colleges 
the day after nixons speech perhaps 500 antiwar protesters 
rallied peacefully at noon on the kent state commons then planned 
to gather again monday 
but that night the first warm evening of the year a small 
crowd of students and townies spilled from a string of bars in 
downtown kent early festiveness turned to angry shouts and 
antiwar slogans a passing police cruiser dodged beer bottles 
the crowd by midnight swollen to 500 people lit a bonfire in 
the street and began smashing shop windows 
the mayor declared a civil emergency imposed a curfew closed 
the bars and summoned the national guard thrown rocks slightly 
injured four or five officers police forced the students back onto 
campus with tear gas 
the violence continued on saturday night the campus rotc 
building was burned down demonstrators threw rocks at firefighters 
and slashed their hoses the arsonists were never identified or 
arrested 
the national guard arrived in the midst of the chaos one convoy 
was stoned as it approached the campus the guardsmen were already 
weary pulled away from patrolling interstate highways during a 
truckers strike 
when they were called out again to patrol monday morning 
nobody had any sleep to amount to anything recalled sgt leon 
smith of beach city ohio 
that same morning alan canfora a 21yearold junior from 
barberton ohio left for the noon rally carrying a black flag his 
banner of mourning for yet another vietnam casualty 
even before the cambodia invasion more americans were dying 
every day the toll was grim 335 killed in january 385 in 
february 442 in march one of the april victims was canforas 
childhood friend 
canfora upset at his friends death and by the presence of the 
guardsmen on campus joined 200 to 300 student protesters gathered 
at the commons as other students left class for lunch the crowd 
grew to as many as 2000 many of them on the hill behind the main 
knot of demonstrators 
many of the dissenters talked angrily about the guardsmen the 
curfew and the universitys ban on rallies announced the day 
before they considered the last an attack on their rights to free 
speech and assembly 
i felt so strongly against the war canfora said in an 
interview i was willing to risk my own life and face those 
rifles i chose the black flag because of the sad state of affairs 
on our campus and in our country 
to enforce the ban on rallies guardsmen drove past in a jeep 
ordering students through a bullhorn to leave the commons 
pigs off campus the students shouted 
sieg heil they chanted mocking the nazi salute 
students hurled stones at the jeep and guardsmen retaliated 
with a burst of tear gas canisters the students tossed them back 
within moments however the nearly 100 guardsmen had fixed 
their bayonets and loaded their weapons mostly m1 rifles they 
advanced on the students scattering them in retreat over the hill 
and down the other side onto the football field and parking lot

as the students retreated allison krause a freshman honors 
student from pittsburgh who had just turned 19 turned to her 
boyfriend and sobbed why are they doing this to us why dont 
they let us be she cursed the soldiers and threw rocks 
the guardsmen regrouped on the practice field knelt and aimed 
their rifles at students in the parking lot but other students had 
regrouped behind them realizing they were outflanked the 
guardsmen rose and marched back up the hill to resume their 
original position on the commons 
they were under bombardment from stones and obscenities but the 
nearest students were at least 60 feet away as the guardsmen 
neared the top of the hill they suddenly turned rifles at their 
shoulders 
the gunfire stunned the students many began running others 
dropped to the ground some thinking the guardsmen were firing 
blanks stood their ground until they heard the bullets hitting 
around them 
joseph lewis jr an 18yearold freshman from massillon ohio 
and probably closest to the guardsmen was shot as he made an 
obscene gesture a guardsman later said he believed lewis was 
advancing on him lewis was hit just below the waist and slammed to 
the ground 
i felt like being hit in the stomach with a shovel he said 
i thought i was dying i prayed another bullet hit his left 
leg 
canfora about 75 yards away was shot in the right wrist i 
got behind a tree thats what saved my life he said im 
convinced they were shooting at me intentionally i could hear 
bullets hitting the tree i could hear bullets zipping and cracking 
through the air and through the grass on both sides of the tree 
sixtyone shots were fired from at least 28 weapons 
allison krause fell mortally wounded 100 yards away from the 
guardsmen a bullet through her chest the body of 20yearold jeff 
miller of plainview ny dropped 90 yards from the rifles 
the fbi said krause and miller were initially at the front of 
the crowd taunting the guardsmen miller made some offensive 
gestures and miss krause shouted obscenities the report said but 
neither was in a position to pose even a remote danger to the 
national guard at the time of the firing 
sandy scheuer 20 of boardman ohio and schroeder were walking 
to class each was about 130 yards from the guardsmen schroeder 
was shot in the back after diving to the ground scheuer was shot 
through the neck 
i was scared said sgt smith who fired one shot into the 
air i felt my life was in danger i had a fellow coming at me 
with what looked like a brick in his hand i had no intention of 
hurting anybody or killing anybody 
what prompted the shootings remains a mystery the fbi said it 
could only speculate one theory is that a guardsman either fired 
in panic or shot intentionally at a student and the other 
guardsmen fired at the sound of the first shot 
the presidents commission on campus unrest said that although 
the actions of some students were violent criminal dangerous 
reckless and irresponsible the indiscriminate firing of rifles 
into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were 
unnecessary unwarranted and inexcusable 
a portage county special grand jury found that the guardsmen 
acted in selfdefense and exonerated them of criminal charges it 
indicted 25 students and faculty members including canfora lewis 
and lough the professor those charges were dropped in december 
1971 
in march 1974 a federal grand jury in cleveland indicted eight 
guardsmen on charges of violating the civil rights of the dead and 
wounded students midway through the trial a judge dropped all 
charges for lack of evidence 
the wounded students and the families of the dead settled a 40 
million civil suit out of court in january 1979 for 675000 but 
more important to them they said was a signed acknowledgment by 
the defendants gov james a rhodes and 27 guardsmen that the 
shootings should not have occurred and that the confrontation could 
have been resolved in other ways 
after years of debate over an appropriate memorial a granite 
plaza with four prominent upright slabs is being dedicated may 4 on 
a 2acre site adjacent to the parking lot where the students were 
killed 
a bouquet of 58175 gold daffodils already blooms around the 
memorial one for each american man and woman killed in vietnam 
for florence schroeder the daffodils are a living memorial more 
valuable than quarried granite her son she explains used to pick 
her wild flowers when he was a schoolboy she says she will plant 
one more daffodil at the memorial 
for him

june romeo is back at kent state a generation 
after witnessing national guard bullets kill four students and 
wound nine more the tears still come easily 
its funny the 38yearold nursing instructor and graduate 
student said they said 13 seconds of gunfire when you stop to 
think one two three four if you count thats a long time 
romeo then an 18yearold freshman from westlake ohio was 
about 20 steps from one of the wounded tom grace you dont 
believe it at first she said no one had ever shot a student 
protester before 
the violence and its emotioncharged aftermath became too much 
for romeo she left campus the next year upset by such scenes as a 
cafeteria confrontation between students joking about the shootings 
and others who were irate 
it was not the right place for me said romeo who tried 
selling insurance then enrolled at baldwinwallace college a small 
liberal arts school in berea near her hometown 
i kept thinking i should go back but i never did said 
romeo who keeps a candle from the first campus anniversary 
memorial may 4 1971 twenty years later she has come back as a 
graduate student and instructor in educational theory 
the tragedy was very personal said romeo whose 
undergraduate students occasionally note her resemblance to the 
young woman whose searing photographic image arms raised high over 
a dying kent state student won a pulitzer prize 
romeo said she pushed the shootings out of her mind along with 
other campus memories she lost track of classmates and roommates 
she collected but never read almost every book about the 
shootings and student unrest in 1970 
i wanted things connected with it she said of the books 
her husband has read the books but the two dont talk about may 
4 
romeo says the only person with whom she discussed kent state in 
detail was a physician and former navy officer who convinced her 
that the guardsmen would never have fired without a command 
that more than anything else has bothered me i cant 
conceive of a mind that would give an order like that she said 
pausing to catch her breath at the thought 
romeos emotions were rekindled four years ago when james 
rhodes who as ohio governor had ordered the national guard onto 
the kent state campus to restore order was a patient at the 
cleveland clinic where romeo was a nurse 
the softspoken romeo said her loathing for rhodes and his role 
in what happened was so strong that she took a day or two off while 
rhodes was hospitalized 
i kept thinking i want so much for him to feel some of the 
terror those people felt she said that really brought it 
back i never had feelings like that about anyone i really cant 
think of people i hate 
romeo returned to kent state fulltime last year she credits 
her social activism for her return to campus and her efforts to 
deal with memories of the shootings she runs a program in 
clevelands inner city that teaches youngsters to read and write as 
well as how to make reasoned decisions that will affect their lives 
i need to help people become aware she said aware of 
choices and consequences 
romeo believes that few among the couple thousand kent state 
students protesting the war on may 4 1970 were aware of the 
potential consequences she teaches her students that youre 
going to have to decide for yourselves what battles are important 
to fight and what arent worth your time and effort 
when her students learn she was a student of the 70s they are 
curious about the period she tells them she favored weird 
clothes and wore her hair long and flowing 
i even wore flowers in my hair she tells them they said 
noooo 
romeo brushes aside the current campus brouhaha over whether the 
granite memorial to be dedicated on the 20th anniversary of the 
shootings is too little too late 
i dont care that much about the memorial she said i 
think the most fitting thing is to keep the whole thing alive 
people 20 years down the line should really be questioning it it 
should be studied like we study wars

did we all descend from eve an african woman 
whose offspring quite literally conquered the world 
though of course no one knows her name some biologists and 
anthropologists believe that all humanity traces its roots to just 
one woman this idea known as the eve hypothesis or the garden of 
eden theory is intriguingly simple 
eve lived in subsaharan africa 100000 to 200000 years ago as 
the ancestors of modern humans her children and grandchildren 
spread throughout africa and eventually across the world 
triggering the extinction of other primitive peoples 
or so some scientists believe 
others ridicule the idea the theory based on a comparison of 
the genes of people around the world is one of the most hotly 
contested controversies in the oftenrancorous field of human 
origins 
at a meeting earlier this year of the american association for 
the advancement of science both sides argued their cases with 
facts speculation and sarcasm 
allan c wilson of the university of california at berkeley one 
of the architects of the eve hypothesis said the evidence is so 
strong that the argument is done clinched finished its over 
not quite countered the other side 
there are serious and obvious flaws in the eve hypothesis 
said geoffrey g pope of the university of illinois 
most everyone agrees that smallbrained humanlike creatures 
arose in africa 15 million to 2 million years ago they spread 
throughout africa europe and southeast asia and flourished for 
hundreds of thousands of years 
but what became of them the theory favored by pope and many 
fossil experts holds that those creatures known as homo erectus 
are the true ancestors of us all 
if they are right these early hominids parted company in africa 
but went on to evolve in unison useful genetic changes that arose 
in small pockets of population slowly spread throughout the world 
as neighboring tribes mingled after thousands of centuries they 
became us modern humans who differ only in superficial racial 
features 
however garden of eden theorists believe those early settlers 
disappeared leaving no trace in humanitys genes instead they say 
they have evidence that a new kind of people arose in africa much 
more recently their kin also spread throughout the prehistoric 
world somehow killing off or squeezing out the european 
neanderthals and other descendants of the first wave out of africa 
the difference between the scenarios is so stark that there 
seems to be no middle ground no room for compromise 
there is no question on this issue said alan g thorne of 
the australian national university an eve skeptic one of us is 
absolutely wrong 
the debate began about three years ago with the use of new 
scientific techniques to look for signs of the family tree inside 
the genes of modern humans this intrusion of the glitzy tools of 
molecular biology have not always been accepted graciously by the 
traditional fossil hunters who rely largely on meticulous 
measurements and comparisons of bone fragments to fathom human 
origins 
david w frayer a neanderthal expert from the university of 
kansas said the quick acceptance of eve reflects a preference for 
sensational catastrophe over mundane gradual change as well as a 
willingness of some to accept without criticism or even 
suspicion the results of molecular biology 
molecular biologys role has been to decipher the genetic 
information inside mitochondria these are structures within human 
cells that help produce energy 
mitochondria have their own genes separate from the chromosomes 
that carry all the other blueprints for human beings ordinary 
genes are a mishmash contributed equally by mothers and fathers 
mitochondrial genes are passed along only by mothers 
therefore each new generation gets an almost exact copy of the 
mitochondrial genes of their forebears the only difference is the 
occasional variation caused by genetic mutations 
these mutations are the key to reading mitochondrial genes as a 
clock biologists believe they know how quickly the mutations 
occur by comparing the degree of mutation in the genes of people 
from different parts of the world they believe they can trace the 
various lines back to the point at which they all converge eve 
the latest study of this sort conducted by linda vigilant at 
berkeley uses hair roots plucked from 199 people from europe 
asia new guinea and seven ethnic groups in africa analyzing the 
root genes she calculates all the people descended from a common 
ancestor who lived in africa 207000 years ago this females 
descendants evolved into physically modern humans by 100000 years 
ago 
as neat as the idea seems anthropologists attack it on several 
grounds 
one is whether the mutations in mitochondrial genes occur like 
clockwork the critics argue that the biologists are overly 
confident that they know the tempo at which the mitochondrial clock 
is ticking 
milford h wolpoff of the university of michigan contends the 
clocks rhythm is hopelessly thrown off by the dead ends of allboy 
families whenever a family produces no girls the orderly 
accumulation of genetic mutations stops cold no mitochondrial 
genes are passed to the next generation 
if there is a clock said thorne it needs new batteries 
other scientists point to the fossil record the teeth and bits 
of bone that remain from the ancient beings 
if the eve theory is correct the new wave of humans migrating 
out of africa 1000 centuries ago did not mate and mingle their 
genes with the ancient hominids that already lived in europe and 
asia instead they replaced them completely 
some fossil experts believe they have found clear signs that 
traits of those ancient peoples have been passed down to modern 
humans for instance pope argues that 1 millionyearold fossils 
from ancient asia have the same cheekbones and wisdom teeth as 
modern asians 
this similarity in facial features indicates that the eve 
hypothesis is completely untenable in asia 
frayer also believes he can see echoes of neanderthal skulls and 
teeth in later generations of europeans 
allison s brooks of george washington university questions eve 
on behavioral grounds she said that if modern humans overran 
europe replacing the dimwitted natives there should also have 
been a cultural revolution 
however she finds no abrupt change showing dramatically more 
advanced stone tools or hunting techniques in europe after the 
supposed arrival of eves offspring

after 100 days in office gov l douglas 
wilder has earned widespread attention for his new mainstream 
agenda but criticism at home from some who say he has ignored black 
concerns and has little vision for virginia 
wilder gets about 250 invitations a week to speak on his 
platform of fiscal conservatism and social progressivism that he 
says helped make him the nations first elected black governor 
its really caught on around the country the new 
mainstream he said in an interview last week shortly before he 
reached his 100th day in office sunday 
although he says national office isnt on his agenda wilder has 
traveled twice to california and will speak at a democratic 
political event in new hampshire in june both states will hold 
early presidential primaries in 1992 
i havent really taken any time from state activities to go to 
any other place he said 
wilders message has worried some black political scientists who 
say he has neglected black issues in an attempt to appeal to white 
voters 
they point to his push to expand the death penalty in virginia 
his opposition to creating a majority black congressional district 
in the state and his refusal to take a stand on whether women 
should be admitted to taxsupported virginia military institute 
i think the reluctance to take a stronger stand on the vmi 
issue is particularly troubling said charles e jones an 
associate professor of political science at old dominion university 
in norfolk if we dont have black politicians taking a more 
aggressive stand on that then who is 
if doug wilders agenda is just going to be politics as usual 
then i dont think theres that much for blacks to be excited 
about said georgia persons associate professor of political 
science at georgia tech university 
wilder said his priorities fighting the drug problem 
eliminating disparity among local school systems and improving 
early childhood education will benefit blacks as well as whites 
blacks are disproportionately affected he said im not 
unaware of it 
the state naacp has refused to criticize wilder even though it 
disagrees with him on the death penalty and redistricting 
i said from the beginning that doug wilder was not going to be 
a black panacea governor said jack w gravely president of the 
state branch of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
if he did not do what hes doing now the press would label 
him a wildeyed jesse jackson gravely said 
wilder has been popular nationally because he is positioning 
himself as an alternative to jackson who represents the democratic 
partys liberal wing said robert holsworth a political analyst at 
virginia commonwealth university in richmond but wilder has yet to 
prove himself in the governors mansion holsworth said 
weve yet to see many substantive initiatives put forward by 
the governor he said hes been much more successful in 
flexing his political muscles and gaining national attention than 
he has been in developing a clear agenda for virginia 
state sen joseph v gartlan jr of fairfax one of the few 
democrats willing to criticize the governor publicly said he is 
still waiting for wilder to explain his pledge to help youth and 
families and his vision for the state 
he really hasnt filled that void yet gartlan said 
in speeches out of state wilder boasted about balancing the 
state budget without mentioning that it is required by state law 
and called his 200 million budget reserve a rainy day fund 
even though it is designated for teacher raises in 1991 gartlan 
said 
its something of a triumph of form over substance he said 
gartlan also said wilders handling of several political 
appointments left a very bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths 
wilder replaced some close associates of former democratic gov 
gerald l baliles on boards and commissions with his own supporters 
and caused a minor flap when he delayed approving lownumbered 
license plates that baliles had requested for his former aides 
one would almost think that he was a republican governor in 
terms of wilders treatment of him holsworth said of baliles 
who has declined to comment on wilder 
holsworth said wilders rough treatment of fellow democrats 
could backfire when he needs their support later but the governor 
said he is not concerned 
in politics people need each other he said 
wilder also disputed the notion that democrats in the general 
assembly are dissatisfied with him 
if that were the case they wouldnt be supporting me as they 
do wilder said he noted that the legislature granted his 
requests for a cap on college tuition increases a budget reserve 
and a repeal of the sales tax on nonprescription drugs 
ive been very impressed with the degree of support he said

the lameduck sandinista front is 
searching hard for a new identity to help it become a viable 
opposition party by the next presidential election six years from 
now 
so far the partys transformation has included shifting away 
from leftist revolutionary rhetoric and becoming more open and 
mainstream 
sandinismo has a big problem it doesnt know what it is 
said emilio alvarez montalvan a veteran of nicaraguan politics and 
foreign affairs adviser to conservative presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro who is to take office wednesday 
theyre not guerrillas any more theyre not 
marxistleninists they dont like being socialdemocrats by 
definition theyre not socialchristians much less conservatives 
or liberals what are they then they themselves dont know 
alvarez said in a recent interview 
losing the feb 25 general elections to mrs chamorros 14party 
national opposition union was a shock and an embarrassment to the 
sandinistas who had ruled for nearly 11 years 
more than a halfdozen opinion polls had given them a wide lead 
over uno their last campaign rally was the largest political 
gathering in nicaraguan history drawing more than 300000 people 
they lied to us one party leader from the interior ministry 
said bitterly after the final tally showed uno obtained 55 percent 
of the vote 
still the sandinista front got 408 percent of the vote which 
because uno is a coalition still leaves it as the single largest 
party in nicaragua 
that to its leaders means the mass support is still there but 
the partys approach and even its image must change before the next 
elections in six years 
i think the cycle of antiimperialist revolutions is coming to 
an end said victor tirado lopez one of nine commanders of the 
1979 revolution that make up the sandinista fronts national 
directorate therefore we must reexamine our path 
what does the electoral defeat of sandinismo express that the 
people want peace and we cant keep pointing to war to resolve 
social contradictions tirado said in an interview published in 
march in barricada the official sandinista front newspaper 
in 1984 the sandinista front and president daniel ortega 
obtained 64 percent of the vote the war with the usbacked 
contra rebels was about two years old then and the revolutionary 
fervor that had toppled rightist president anastasio somoza was 
still high 
but after a decade of war and economic hardship resulting from a 
us economic embargo and sandinista administrative imcompetence 
nicaraguans apparently decided to believe unos promise that only 
it could bring peace and prosperity to the nation 
the sandinista leadership met in emergency session and came out 
with a pronouncement that gave a glimpse of the partys new 
direction 
we have the total willingness to back all those actions that 
go in favor of the people but we have the willingess and firm will 
to oppose and resist with the strength of the people all those 
actions that go against the people ortega said in a speech less 
than 48 hours after the election 
his vow to rule from below has become the new sandinista 
slogan one that draws strength from a grassroots organization 
built on labor unions farm cooperatives women and youth groups 
after the elections the sandinista front announced it would 
join the socialist international a worldwide association of 
parties that generally advocate socialism through democratic reform 
rather than armed revolution 
that indicates a change of attitude reinforced by last years 
dramatic fall of hardline communist leaders in the soviet bloc 
ten or 20 years ago many people underestimated electoral 
democracy they only accepted armed struggle and insurrection to 
grab power from the bourgueoisie tirado said today times 
have changed 
more recently the sandinistas have rushed to get a hold on mass 
media knowing they will need a public forum 
nearly the entire staff of the voice of nicaragua the 
government radio station has started to move to radio ya a new 
station being set up at sandinista headquarters 
workers at another sandinistadominated radio station la 
primerisima have been given ownership of the facility 
the front also started an alternative nightly news hour called 
extravision broadcast on nicaraguas sole tv station the 
sandinista television system 
the sandinistas already have begun acting like an opposition 
party threatening strikes if the contras dont fulfill an accord 
to dismantle by june 10 
ortega in a televised speech last week said enforcing that 
accord was the sandinistas main objective for the next few months 
it amounted to a description of his job as a political leader and 
gave the party a rallying theme

a tenured black professor at harvard law 
school is threatening to request a leave of absence to protest the 
lack of women and minorities on the schools faculty 
the professor derrick bell has decided to go on leave and stay 
on leave without pay until a black woman has been offered and 
accepts a position on the law school faculty according to a 
statement he prepared for release tuesday by a student activist 
group 
reached monday night bell refused to discuss the matter in 
detail referring a reporter to the student coalition for civil 
rights which has been staging protests demanding the hiring of 
more minority faculty at the law school the law school has five 
black professors three of them tenured out of a faculty of more 
than 65 according to bell 
according to coalition spokesman keith boykin bell prepared the 
following statement for release tuesday 
i cannot in good conscience continue in a role that limits 
rather than expands faculty diversity i cannot continue to urge 
students to take risks for what they believe if i do not practice 
my own precepts 
i hope students will be moved by my example to continue their 
efforts to gain sooner rather than later the diversity in our 
faculty that is now so positive a force in our student body his 
statement said 
before the noon rally where bell was scheduled to make his 
announcement he and the law school administration were expected to 
hold talks about the possibility hiring of a black woman on law 
school faculty 
bell and the coalition for civil rights are urging the school to 
hire regina austin a black woman who is a visiting professor at 
harvard austin has been offered a permanent post at the university 
of michigan boykin said monday 
bell 59 is a former member of the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee a civil rights group he first taught at 
the law school in 1969 but left in 1980 to become dean of the 
university of oregon law school bell returned to harvard in 1986 
where he was then the only tenured black professor 
last may during student sitins to protest what they called a 
lack of diversity on the faculty some students pushed to have bell 
named dean of the law school 
bell put the number of minority students at the school at 400 
with fewer than 200 of those black harvard law school has about 
1500 students 
bell said that there were only five female law professors none 
of them black 
the students have been urging greater diversity i guess its 
been happening in many other places around the country bell said 
monday night thus far there has not been very much in the way 
of positive response to demands given the administration a couple 
of months ago

housewives in this border town 
silently curse pushy west germans who grab all the seats at the 
beauty parlor 
they and their husbands are tired of seeing welloff west 
germans load up their cars with relatively cheap statesubsidized 
goods from tools to meat and drive back across the border 
citizens of the two germanys are getting to know one other after 
40 years of separation but dont always like what they see 
id say 80 percent of them are really good people but then 
theres that other 20 percent uwe fritsch said of the west 
germans fritsch runs an electronics store in this drab border town 
185 miles west of berlin 
people in muehlhausen and towns on the other side of the hilly 
frontier look upon the opening of the border as the most important 
event in postwar german history 
east germans have their freedom and good chances for future 
prosperity west germans probably will increase their own wealth 
and international clout after reunification 
close friendships have sprung up and in some ways the frontier 
has ceased to exist 
as in marriage however the germans are discovering that their 
new partners are imperfect 
some east germans see western visitors as brash rude people who 
like to show off their wealth and view themselves as humbler folk 
not consumed by greed 
in west germany a popular view is that east germans are 
backward lazy and unrefined 
a shoplifting boom in west german border towns also has dampened 
some of the reunification euphoria 
all along the border from schleswigholstein to bavaria 
department store and supermarket managers are unable to rescue 
themselves from long fingers from the east stern magazine said 
most of the discontent is on the eastern side of the border 
there even have been reports of brawls in east german taverns 
one began in muehlhausen when an inebriated east german sitting 
across from a west german who was trying to make time with an east 
german woman suddenly declared all westerners are liars 
young west germans often head over there on the prowl for 
young east german women who are impressed by fast cars motorcycles 
and west german marks 
many wessis also come in search of statesubsidized goods 
and services 
at a good restaurant in east germany for example a meal might 
cost onethird of the price in the west the official exchange rate 
for tourists is three east marks for every west mark on the black 
market its 6 for 1 
west germans have mobbed border towns like muehlhausen to buy 
bargainpriced goods 
its not fair when you have to wait in a long line and then 
find out everything you wanted is gone said barbara weber uwe 
fritschs sister who helps him in the store 
one recent day a west german family loaded up their mobile home 
with armloads of meat presumably to freeze at home 
roswitha vogler who works in a butcher shop said the crowd of 
west germans in the beauty parlor angers many muehlhausen women 
on saturdays there isnt a single place left she said 
aggressiveness is not exclusive to westerners 
at the stadt muehlhausen hotel a westerner sitting with an east 
german woman paid for their meal and drinks with west marks 
you idiot the woman snapped why didnt you tell me you 
needed ost marks i would have changed your money at onetofour

real estate problems are spreading from the 
southwest and northeast threatening metropolitan markets across 
the nation according to a new statistical analysis by banking 
regulators 
banks in regions already beset with falling or flat real estate 
prices have responded by tightening their lending policies an 
analysis by the federal deposit insurance corp shows that lenders 
elsewhere also may have reason for concern 
the fdic which insures bank and savings and loan deposits up to 
100000 has fashioned what it hopes will be an early warning 
system that identifies soft real estate markets before they turn 
sour 
a preliminary version released last week examined commercial 
real estate in 40 metropolitan areas some wellknown sore spots in 
the southwest ranked high on the list phoenix ariz was first 
austin texas was sixth and oklahoma city was seventh 
but many of the riskiest markets were surprises nashville 
tenn was second followed by anaheim calif atlanta and 
philadelphia rounding out the top 10 were san jose calif 
detroit and fort lauderdale fla 
the fdic ranked the markets on three factors increase in new 
office construction started growth in office jobs and change in 
office vacancy rates 
markets with the slowest job growth the biggest increase in 
construction and the steepest increase in vacancies are considered 
the most vulnerable to a downturn 
our preliminary work has led us to conclude that extraordinary 
growth is often followed by an economic downturn said fdic 
chairman l william seidman imprudent growth can result in real 
estate supply getting ahead of market demand sometimes with 
extremely unfavorable results 
when things are good builders want to build and lenders want 
to lend said economist mark zandi of regional financial 
associates of west chester pa but what happens is you get 
overbuilding vacancy rates can take off very quickly 
a report last week by alex sheshunoff an austin texas 
consultant underscored the consequences when bank lending becomes 
too gung ho 
commercial banks last year earned 163 billion 34 percent less 
than in 1988 sheshunoff attributed much of the deterioration to 
real estate lending 
delinquent real estate loans more than doubled in eight of nine 
states in the northeast last year he said they tripled in 
massachusetts and were six times higher in connecticut 
sheshunoff however predicted that a crackdown by banking 
regulators will prevent the kind of real estate bust that hit the 
oilproducing states of the southwest in the mid 1980s 
it is often the regulators job to prescribe preventive 
medicine he said it means pulling the punch bowl away from 
the party earlier in the evening to the profound displeasure of the 
partygoers 
regulators scrutiny of bank lending has drawn complaints from 
borrowers politicians and economists who say credit is drying up 
even for good projects 
the national association of home builders last week trimmed its 
housing starts projection for this year by 30000 units to 135 
million attributing the drop in part to a regulatory credit 
crunch 
new england business executives and members of congress are 
planning a meeting with federal regulators in boston this week 
concerning what rep barney frank dmass called 
overregulation 
theyve been particularly upset with examiners from the office 
of the comptroller of the currency which supervises nationally 
chartered banks and has ordered large writedowns at many 
institutions in the region 
a study released last week by the federal reserve board 
confirmed that a large majority of 60 of the countrys largest 
banks had tightened real estate lending in the last six months 
the banks blamed the credit crunch largely on economic 
conditions rather than on closer scrutiny by regulators however 
some economists believe the squeeze is a cause and not just a 
symptom of the economic slowdown 
not long ago almost anyone who was willing to pay the right 
price interest rates was able to get credit that is no longer 
true economist sung won sohn of norwest corp in minneapolis 
said in a recent newsletter credit rationing is hurting economic 
growth for the first time since the early 1970s 
to me it is a time for regulators to be judicious in their 
actions not to squeeze down too hard im very concerned a 
lot of this countrys wealth is tied up in real estate said 
william isaac a former fdic chairman who now heads the secura 
group consulting firm 
officials in the comptrollers office maintain that it is 
economic conditions that have toughened not their examination 
standards earlier this month they took the unusual step of holding 
briefings for financial analysts and reporters to deny that they 
had launched a crackdown 
circumstances have changed we have to come in and put 
some reality back in thats our job said richard kovarik a 
senior bank examiner in the comptrollers office 
don inscoe the fdics research director defended his agencys 
risk list from criticism that regulators in effect declared a loan 
moratorium for some areas 
we arent necessarily saying you shouldnt lend in the places 
high on the list were just saying that in the past extremely 
high growth has resulted in a crash he said

only in america could an irish bandleader 
in a town of polish immigrants transform that most hokey of ethnic 
music into sounds worthy of carnegie hall 
you see polkas dont come just with kielbasa anymore 
slush down some beer and polish sausage thats all some 
people see when they think of the polka said fred hudy 
president of the international polka association in chicago 
were trying to get rid of that image 
theyre definitely out of the closet now said ian dove 
spokesman for the national academy of recording arts and sciences 
which added a polka category to the grammys five years ago 
the jimmy sturr orchestra is riding the new wave of polka 
popularity winning the grammy four straight years sturr has 
played at new yorks carnegie hall six times the only polka band 
to perform that much at the celebrated concert auditorium 
once relegated to the stomping grounds of local sausage fests or 
to sunday morning radio broadcasts the polka is following latin 
american and cajun into the musical mainstream 
its big business said sturr 42 an irish bandleader who 
lives in the orange county village of florida about 30 miles 
northwest of new york city 
his 10piece orchestra has recorded 76 albums 75 polka and one 
country on his starr records label which he started in 1964 the 
label records other polka country and ethnic groups including 
bobby vinton 
getting its own grammy category has completed the legitimization 
of a musical form once thought squarer than the square dance until 
1985 polka music was lumped into the catchall folk category dove 
said 
it was felt that polka was a form of music unto itself he 
said similarly the grammy trustees created separate categories 
for reggae tropical latin and mexicanamerican music in recent 
years 
sturr started his first band when he was 11 though irish he 
was surrounded by polishamericans who made up fourfifths of his 
hometowns population sturr grew up with the polka and fell in 
love with the music he began recording and touring with his polka 
band in the musical maelstrom of the 1960s when most people viewed 
the polka as a dance confined to the bowling alley crowds of 
milwaukee or buffalo 
its moved out of that ethnic category sturr said now 
everybody enjoys the polka when i was a kid and somebody said 
hey what kind of band do you have id be embarrassed to say im 
in a polka band 
minnesota gov rudy perprich declared 1990 the year of the 
polka thousands attend polka festivals each year in minnesota 
which claims to have the granddaddy of all polka fests in 
gibbon minn 
like cajun and country the shrill brass and reedy woodwinds of 
some polka styles revolve around the accordion which is enjoying 
its own return from corn purgatory 
its a happy music its a snappy music hudy said your 
feet automatically tap 
several rock groups have transformed themselves into new wave 
polka bands turning out what sturr calls punk polka one such 
band rotundi has scored a parody polka hit with polka till you 
puke 
in the united states the polka is most closely associated with 
polishamericans yet the polka invented in 1830 by a peasant 
girl in bohemia now part of czechoslovakia never was popular in 
poland even though it was influenced by polish styles of music and 
dance 
as the polka swept through europe in the 1830s and 40s poland 
was trying to regain its independence from russia other europeans 
considered the polka a twostep with a hop thrown in a dance of 
sympathy for polands oppression but the poles felt the polka 
mocked the way polish women danced said charles keil american 
studies professor at the state university of buffalo 
europeans had a general fascination with poland as a 
struggling country whose borders had been violated thats 
where polka dots came from everybody was naming things after the 
polka said keil whose book polka happiness is being 
published by temple university 
from europe the polka traveled around the world it became 
paraguays national dance while american indians out west adopted 
a form of polka in the 1860s 
those indians think of the polka as their traditional music 
nowadays keil said 
while sturrs polishamerican polkas win grammys 
mexicanamerican bands in southern texas are producing the most 
innovative polka music today keil said 
the mexicanamerican style mixes latin and polka rhythms while 
sturrs eastern polish style relies on woodwinds accordions and a 
frantic beat in the midwest the slower german polka with its 
brassy oompahs is popular while plucky banjos highlight country 
polka styles 
polkas must be written in twofour time two quarter notes per 
measure a tempo which gives the music its dancy beat the songs 
can range from the toofat polka with its whimsical chorus 
i dont want her you can have her shes too fat for me to 
the more sentimental did you ever fall in love polka from one 
of sturrs albums 
songwriter steve lopuch has contributed three songs to sturrs 
records including titles on his 1988 grammy album i remember 
warsaw and this years winner all in my love for you 
lopuchs source material ranges from nursery rhymes in the 
crooked man polka to allamerican denim in the blue jeans 
polka 
when these people came the irish polish lithuanians 
germans italians they didnt have nothing said lopuch a 
retired dairy farmer in the montgomery county town of florida 30 
miles west of albany not to be confused with the village of 
florida where sturr grew up they planned to stay a few years 
make some money and go back but most didnt go back they stayed 
and so did their music 
lopuch has written about a dozen polkas based on nursery rhymes 
which he hopes to have recorded by sturrs orchestra or some other 
polka band 
im hoping grandparents will buy it for their grandchildren so 
they dont listen only to rock lopuch said 
keil has similar hopes that more young people will turn to 
polka local polka fests are dying out because a younger 
generation has not come along and gotten into the dancing of it in 
any big way he said 
he predicts there will be a revival of polka dancing its so 
good its eating drinking dancing partying music because it 
survived so long despite rock n roll despite tv because some 
fanatic people wont give it up its a matter of young people 
getting really bored with postpunk nonsense people will see that 
community dancing is a powerful thing

mario bonilla was traveling outside nicaragua in 
1981 when he was tried for promoting human rights he never 
returned home after learning he had been sentenced to 23 years in 
prison for counterrevolutionary activities 
like thousands of other nicaraguan professionals bonilla a 
doctor fled to south florida to escape the leftist sandinista 
regime of daniel ortega 
but now that the euphoria of violeta chamorros upset 
presidential victory over ortega in february has subsided the 
professionals nicaragua needs desperately are weighing a return 
carefully and many are choosing not to go back 
some of the reasons are financial but much of the concern is 
over the role the defeated sandinistas will play after the new 
government is sworn in wednesday and how those returning will be 
treated 
we are afraid said bonilla president of the nicaraguan 
medical association in exile the sandinistas are in the same 
place with the same weapons there are only some changes in the 
administrative area at this moment 
the exile community is in agreement all should work hard to 
help our country said roberto arguello founding president of 
the nicaraguanamerican bankers and businessmen association but 
were all being very cautious because the new government is very 
fragile 
the chamorro government has been sending a special message to 
the estimated 150000 nicaraguan exiles in miami we need you to 
help rebuild the country in ruins after a decade of civil war 
emotional appeals to exiled professionals have come in person 
recently from vice presidentelect virgilio gody mrs chamorros 
chief economic adviser francisco mayorga and the 
presidentelects son pedro joaquin chamorro mrs chamorro 
addressed exiles last month in houston where she was treated for a 
knee injury 
its a country that has been drained of its talent said 
adolfo calero a former director of the nicaraguan resistance a 
nowdisbanded umbrella group for antisandinista rebels or contras 
theres a need for people with knowhow not only 
professionals but technical and skilled workers and politicians 
lawyers engineers doctors 
yet the exiles many of whom lost their homes businesses and 
properties to the sandinistas remain wary about the transition to 
a multiparty democracy following a decade under revolutionary 
sandinista rule 
a recent survey of some 3000 members of the federation of 
nicaraguan professional association in exile which represents 
professions from engineers to lawyers found about 20 percent 
wanted to return to their homeland 
that number is expected to go up some after the chamorro 
government is sworn in said bonilla who also is president of the 
federation 
bonilla said those going back are seeking guarantees of their 
safety he has decided to stay here but not just because of 
political concerns 
bonilla a psychiatrist is among 100 nicaraguan physicians 
enrolled in a program created by the state last year for them to 
obtain licenses to practice in florida each doctor gets a 10000 
interestfree loan to finance his studies 
even those who have established themselves in this country and 
have the resources for a quick return to nicaragua are proceeding 
slowly 
last month dr antonio lourenco was among the first exiles to 
go back and try to reclaim his home in an exclusive neighborhood of 
managua the coral gables psychiatrist lost his justbuilt home 
when dictator anastasio somoza fell while the family was in miami 
on vacation in 1979 
he found during his visit a country destroyed in every aspect 
physically morally economically now the people are willing 
to rebuild the country and start over 
lourenco wants to be part of that process but he expects a long 
battle in the courts first to get back his home and properties 
confiscated by the sandinistas 
the chamorro government has said it is prepared to create a fund 
to reimburse owners who cant get back their homes through the 
courts 
meanwhile portugueseborn lourenco plans to contribute by 
visiting managua once a month and seeing some patients until i 
can see more clear the situation 
even if most exiles could return nicaragua would not be able to 
absorb them all at once said arguello citing high unemployment 
and a housing shortage 
but many exiles have already begun to explore investment 
opportunities since the bush administration lifted a fiveyear 
economic embargo after mrs chamorros victory and proposed a 300 
million aid package 
some are optimistic about returning 
eduardo miranda assistant chief of surgical residents at a dade 
county hospital has begun planning his return with his wife and 
three children he said they always expected to go back to 
nicaragua once fighting ended 
i trust the sandinistas too because i think they have been 
changing lately i think theyre not going to give chamorro any 
trouble miranda said

last month 25 years after first reading 
walden in high school in east texas rock singer don henley 
finally visited this picturesque sandy pond that inspired henry 
david thoreau more than a century ago 
the walden pond he saw which lies less than a hundred yards 
from a highway and is adjacent to a dump is far less pastoral than 
when walden lived by its shore in a tiny shack in 1845 
ive been an active environmentalist for over 20 years and 
part of that activism stems from reading his works said henley 
i just assumed walden would be preserved forever 
the grammywinning singer was moved to visit walden pond and 
walden woods after watching a tv report about residents fighting a 
proposed condominium project a half mile from the pond 
proponents of the project including the developers and some 
state officials say it will mean affordable housing residents 
believe it will mar the area and they want to make the 3000acre 
area a national landmark 
after watching the tv report henley organized friends such as 
bonnie raitt glenn frey bob seger john cougar mellencamp don 
johnson and carrie fisher for two concerts at the worcester centrum 
this week to raise money to buy up land near the pond and preserve 
it the amount of money needed has not been disclosed 
you hear all this hoopla about earth day and how far weve 
come as a nation and our new consciousness about the environment 
henley said in a telephone interview last week but it seems 
incredibly ironic that we cant preserve the place where that 
consciousness came from thoreau for all practical purposes is the 
father of the environmental movement 
henleys walden woods project also includes environmental 
leaders scholars and politicians henley 42 is cochairman along 
with michael kennedy 32 the son of sen robert f kennedy former 
sen paul tsongas and mohandas gandhis grandson arun gandhi a 
writer and philosopher are among the members 
the groups focus has been criticized by state officials who say 
the celebrities dont realize they are helping block affordable 
housing 
amy s anthony state secretary of communities and development 
sent a letter to henley claiming his groups campaign is a 
thinlyveiled attempt on the part of a few to obstruct the 
construction of affordable housing in a wealthy suburban 
community 
kennedy who runs a boston company that provides lowcost 
heating oil to the poor said affordable housing is compatible with 
preservation of walden woods 
walden pond is a 62acre body of water in a 333acre state 
reservation on the edge of concord an affluent town of 12500 
about 20 miles from boston

several environmental organizations at the 
forefront of earth day celebrations are under fire from a seemingly 
unrelated group planning its own march on the capitol next weekend 
the national right to life committee 
the antiabortion leaders are asking members to withhold support 
from environmental groups they regard as proabortion among those 
on the list the sierra club the national audubon society and the 
national wildlife federation 
they also are criticizing the league of conservation voters the 
environmental movements major political action committee for 
including abortionrelated votes on its 1989 congressional 
scorecard 
douglas johnson right to lifes legislative director said the 
listed groups are trying to overturn major prolife policies 
including the socalled mexico city policy that denies us funds 
for organizations that promote abortion as a method of family 
planning in foreign countries 
fortunately there are other environmental and wildlife 
organizations which do not engage in proabortion activities 
johnson told members in last months newsletter 
readers are encouraged to disseminate the names of both the 
good and bad environmental groups in local prolife 
newsletters church newspapers and the like he said 
ali webb director of elections for the league of conservation 
voters said her organization was targeted because it advocates 
family planning 
they right to life represent a point of view that family 
planning is not an appropriate arena for environmental action but 
if something isnt done the world population will double in the 
next 37 years webb said 
the worlds ecosystem is unable to support that many people 
the problems of deforestation and global warming are due to the 
fact that there are too many bodies on earth she said 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said there is a natural alliance between environmentalists and 
the prochoice movement 
people need to understand the connection between family 
planning and our ability to feed people and save the planet yard 
said in an interview i think the right to life committee is very 
afraid of what might happen if the environmental groups join us 
they are not dumb 
right to life is most critical of the national wildlife 
federation and the national audubon society it accuses both of 
misleading members about their positions on abortion 
although opposed to the sierra clubs stand on abortion right 
to life gave that group some credit because it does not seek to 
conceal its policy recognizing abortion as an acceptable means of 
controlling population growth 
william w howard executive vice president of the national 
wildlife federation said his group has tried to explain its 
position to right to life and specifically to johnson for more than 
a year 
the national wildlife federation does not promote abortion 
he said we have no policy position specifically on abortion our 
policies are directed toward population stabilization and quality 
of life 
patricia baldi the national audubon societys director of 
population said right to life has distorted her groups position 
she said it has no position on abortion but supports family 
planning programs as a critical element of population control 
for a long time environmental groups thought they were 
controversial enough without getting into family planning but that 
is changing she said 
i think the real fear at right to life is what will happen if 
8 million people in the environmental community decide they want to 
do something on this issue we really have the potential to turn 
this thing around baldi said 
nancy wallace director of the sierra clubs international 
population program said if the right to life committee has any 
real interest in the environment it will endorse proposals to 
increase international contraception funding

to combat consumer shortages irans 
parliament has approved the death penalty for people convicted of 
hoarding profiteering and black market dealings tehran radio 
reports 
in a broadcast monitored sunday in nicosia the radio said if 
profiteering or hoarding is meant to counter the islamic republics 
establishment the profiteer and hoarder will be executed 
iranian officials and the media call such individuals economic 
terrorists 
iranians contend daily with shortages of consumer goods while a 
black market flourishes for those with the means to pay exorbitant 
prices it is common practice for shopkeepers and businessmen to 
divert governmentsubsidized consumer goods to the black market 
ayatollah emami kashani a member of 12man council of 
guardians which screens all legislation for conformity with 
islamic law and the constitution told the radio that his committee 
approved the bill 
kashani said that according to the law the wealth and property 
of profiteers and hoarders could be confiscated by the government 
the draconian law comes during a growing outcry about official 
corruption and economic problems including an annual inflation 
rate unofficially estimated anywhere between 100 to 200 percent 
iranian opposition groups have reported protests in several 
iranian cities in recent weeks with demonstrators demanding 
economic reforms 
a radical iranian daily last month reported sharp price 
increases over the last year for a number of items 
the farsilanguge jomhuri islami reported that the price of 
lentils had gone up almost threefold to 1300 rials 18 at the 
official exchange rate a kilo 22 pounds while a pair of mens 
pants sold for 11000 rials 157

some think it odd that greta garbo the nations 
most famous recluse lived in its most crowded city 
but this is because they do not understand the allure of new 
yorks dense street life and the implicit contract between true 
new yorkers and true celebrities a pact that confers on the famous 
a pleasing mixture of adulation and anonymity 
garbo who died april 15 at age 84 wasnt really a recluse and 
she didnt come here to be alone she didnt like to talk to 
journalists or have her picture taken but she liked to do 
something that is harder and harder to do in this country walk 
along city streets to run errands stretch the legs and see whats 
going on 
she was able to do this in new york because of the 
aforementioned contract which stipulates that when new yorkers 
spot a star they suppress the urge to point and scream and keep 
their distance the celebrity returns the favor by acknowledging 
the recognition with a nod wink or halfsmile 
celebrities accordingly can walk to work eat at a restaurant 
watch a ballgame or visit a museum without being mobbed yet enjoy 
the reassurance that their presence has not gone unnoticed 
in los angeles celebrities have all the privacy they want 
back yard swimming and tennis drivein everything restaurants 
with unlisted phone numbers privacy at any rate can be obtained 
anywhere as howard hughes found in las vegas and jd salinger has 
found in new hampshire 
but if thats what most celebrities wanted they would have 
become monks or cloistered nuns 
john lennon had to be dragged here in the early 70s by yoko 
ono and the couple moved into the dakota apartment building 
because of its security but he soon realized that sophisticated 
new york was relatively free of suffocating beatlemania yet 
sufficiently appreciative of his genius 
above all it was a real place a tough worldly port city like 
liverpool and hamburg biographer albert goldman reports that 
lennon was thrilled by fresh contact with the street such as 
the time he and a street musician were told to move on by a 
policeman in front of the fillmore east rock ballroom 
as it turned out lennon in 1980 was shot to death by an 
obsessed fan outside the dakota 
especially for younger movie and pop stars new yorks allure 
lies somewhere between getting lost in the crowd and drawing a 
crowd and it ties into the desire of many creative people to see 
and be seen albeit discreetly 
listen to actress elizabeth mcgovern one of the growing number 
of film stars who live here to walk down the street in new york 
keeps me more connected to real life as opposed to the isolation 
you feel in la where youre always in a car and always reminded 
of the movie business she also rides the subway 
while the good life in beverly hills is tarnished by the 
spectacle of tourist buses rolling past the stars homes 
manhattans only equivalent is an outofprint map of the stars 
homes and walking tours of celebrity neighborhoods 
the map was discontinued after several stars sued the walking 
tours are hardly intrusive tour director sam stafford says that 
when lillian gish complained he stopped mentioning the elderly 
actress address on east 57th street 
tour members hear a lot of stories about the stars but see only 
the drawn blinds of their apartment house windows there are a few 
exceptions one tour bumped into paul simon on fifth avenue and 
another encountered carly simon in central park he posed for 
photos and she signed autographs 
much of the time celebrities pass unnoticed sometimes with the 
help of sunglasses jacqueline kennedy onassis and floppy hats 
woody allen dustin hoffman is notorious for profanely refusing 
autograph requests mrs onassis says no and keeps walking 
some stars think their privacy is being violated when it isnt 
startled by the pop of a flashbulb as he dined at the four seasons 
yul brynner demanded that his waiter confiscate the film from the 
shutterbugs polaroid as the picture developed however the actor 
was embarrassed to see that the subject was not his gleaming dome 
but the dessert cart

words like deceit greed revenge and 
corruption have been used before in arkansas politics but not 
often in a republican gubernatorial primary 
this years gop race between rep tommy robinson and sheffield 
nelson former friends and democrats who abandoned the party last 
year has all the intrigue of a primetime soap opera 
the likely democratic nominee is fourterm gov bill clinton 
who pulled back from a presidential bid in 1988 and is regarded as 
a potential presidential candidate for 1992 or beyond 
nelson a little rock attorney made 77 million in 12 years at 
the helm of arkansas biggest gas utility sometimes helping 
robinson who was sheriff of pulaski county which includes little 
rock in the early 1980s 
their duel for the gop nomination has focused more attention on 
a tangled web of dealings involving three power brokers who like 
to stay behind the scenes than on matters of public policy 
two of the key figures are brothers wr witt stephens and 
jackson t stephens owners of the largest us investment firm off 
wall street the third is dallas cowboys owner jerry jones a 
lifetime pal of robinsons until this campaign 
kingmakers since the segregationera days of sixterm governor 
orval e faubus the stephens familys political apparatus which 
appeared to slumber in recent years has revived to try to crush 
nelson and carry robinson 
they own him lock stock and barrel nelson says 
nelson owes a lot to witt stephens who headed the arkla inc 
natural gas utility helped nelson get a job with the company 
promoted the young lawyer and when stephens retired in 1973 
nelson was the handpicked successor 
the relationship soon soured according to nelson stephens 
became upset when nelson wouldnt have arkla buy gas from stephens 
at inflated prices and refused to allow arkla to deal with most of 
the stephens subsidiaries 
i think theyre greedy nelson said i think theyre mean 
i think they can hold grudges and i think the best evidence i can 
give you is the grudge theyve held for me over the years 
stephens 82 a longtime democrat said the only candidate hes 
supporting this year is his nephew former rep ray thornton whos 
running for robinsons seat but his feelings toward nelson are 
clear i want all thieves beat the way he managed the gas 
company is not very commendable 
robinson is among those pointing fingers at a deal arkla made in 
1982 under nelson the company sold mineral leases on thousands of 
acres to arkoma productions which was owned by jones who also was 
a pal of nelson 
he sold our property too cheap those leases too cheap 
stephens said in my opinion hes a thief and i dont recommend 
thieves to anybody 
jones paid 15 million and spent another 35 million on drilling 
and acquisitions before he sold the gas rights and the rest of his 
company to arkla in a deal whose eventual cost to arkla was more 
than 160 million 
robinson meanwhile lost his friendship with jones by jumping 
on the deal between jones and nelson if he ran our state like 
arkla the state would be bankrupt and sheffield nelson would end 
up making sam walton look like a pauper walton is the 
billionaire walmart founder 
it was another close relationship gone sour 
jones and robinson had grown up together in north little rock 
as a rich man jones loaned robinson thousands of dollars to buy 
christmas presents pay medical bills and get by asked in 1988 how 
he managed to raise six children on a policemans salary robinson 
said i borrowed money from jerry jones 
they also had a partnership in a farm but their business ties 
fell apart this year after robinsons criticism of the deal and 
after jones daughter charlotte resigned as chief of robinsons 
staff 
while witt denounces nelson but otherwise stays on the 
sidelines his brother jack a republican supports robinson 
jacks wife mary anne stephens is robinsons campaign chairman 
and terry rose witts soninlaw is robinsons campaign manager 
in pulaski county 
the ties with the stephens family have led to questions about 
whether robinson will exercise a free hand if he becomes governor 
says robinson nobody controls me just ask jerry jones

political support for a fullscale star wars 
antimissile defense is fading as fast as the cold war tensions 
that gave rise to the idea seven years ago 
president bush says he wants to deploy the system which is 
banned by an existing ussoviet treaty as soon the pentagon 
decides the sensors radars satellites and hittokill 
interceptors are ready but even some members of bushs own party 
say the project needs reshaping in light of a receding soviet 
military threat 
others question bushs commitment to preserving the vision his 
former boss president reagan first outlined in launching his 
strategic defense initiative on march 23 1983 
the presidents going to have to get involved rep william 
dickinson rala he cautioned the projects director lt gen 
george monahan that many in congress were itching to gut the 
program which has been nicknamed star wars for its proposed use of 
futuristic weaponry 
hes going to have to draw a line in the sand on an 
acceptable level of spending for sdi said dickinson a star wars 
advocate otherwise sdi supporters will get crushed in a 
budgetcutting stampede 
to hold back the charge on capitol hill defense secretary dick 
cheney launched a spring offensive to promote sdi but his has been 
a lonely voice cheney argues that because the soviets remain the 
only country capable of threatening the survival of the united 
states and because of doubt about the stability of the kremlin 
leadership america needs a reliable defense against ballistic 
missiles 
a superpower arms treaty now under negotiation would reduce the 
number of longrange nuclear missiles but both sides would keep 
more than enough to destroy each other 
cheney also put a new wrinkle on the administrations rationale 
protecting the united states and its overseas interests from a 
possible smallscale ballistic missile attack by third world 
countries or from an accidental launch 
bush struck on this new theme when he visited lawrence livermore 
national laboratory in california two months ago to tout progress 
in the brilliant pebbles technology that would place thousands 
of selfcontained kinetic rockets in permanent orbit the 
threefootlong rockets would detect and track enemy missiles as 
they left their silos then vaporize the targets by ramming them at 
30000 mph 
in the 1990s strategic defense makes much more sense than 
ever before bush declared 
last month on the seventh anniversary of reagans speech 
envisioning a star wars defense bush tried to reinforce the idea 
that sdi was more than a protection against a soviet threat 
in a new international environment as ballisticmissile 
capabilities proliferate defense against thirdcountry threats 
also becomes an increasingly important benefit he said 
for all that sdi supporters have long suspected that bush was a 
lukewarm advocate some say the president may be forced in this 
years defense budget debate to show his true colors 
its fair to say that clear presidential prestige is now on 
the line says baker spring analyst at the conservative heritage 
foundation think tank and a strong advocate of sdi 
other analysts say that even with bush pushing congress to 
provide more financial nourishment for star wars the project is 
unlikely ever to reach full blossom 
the spirit behind sdi died with the end of the reagan 
administration says robert h kupperman a science and 
technology expert at the center for strategic and international 
studies a washington think tank 
even some of the pentagons senior sdi officials are suggesting 
that a ballistic missile defense may never include the spacebased 
elements now under development 
i dont know if a decision is ever going to be made to deploy 
fullup says lt gen robert hammond commander of star wars 
work at the armys strategic defense command maybe thats not 
all bad 
kupperman favors development of a smallscale defense against 
ballistic missiles but says a fullblown defensive shield of the 
kind now being pursued will fall victim to tighter defense budgets 
and perceptions of a more peaceful world 
the congress is in no mood to fund it he says 
money not menace now appears to be the predominant force 
shaping the future of sdi 
bush has asked congress to approve 48 billion in sdi spending 
for the 1991 fiscal year starting oct 1 an increase of 1 billion 
from this year much of the increase is earmarked for 16 tests of 
key technologies including the first attempt by a brilliant 
pebble to intercept an object in suborbital space 
it may be months before the sdi budget is finally set but it 
appears likely that bush will have to settle for far less than he 
wants congress search for a peace dividend from the fading 
cold war makes star wars a fat target 
sdi is a logical place to look for savings says rep 
charles bennett dfla 
bennett who says he favors continuing research and development 
of sdi but not deployment led a house charge last fall to cut the 
projects budget below the administrations request he said in an 
interview that he intends to introduce an amendment this session to 
limit 1991 sdi spending to perhaps 25 billion 
cheney said in a speech march 19 that the money crunch has put 
sdi at a crossroads 
we want to move forward our critics want to cut back the 
issue between us is almost entirely political he said 
yet even some prominent republicans are ruling out any increased 
commitment to sdi 
sens william cohen of maine and john mccain of arizona 
prominent members of the senate armed services committee said in a 
joint defense proposal april 5 that this years 38 billion sdi 
budget should be an upper limit to future funding levels 
the senators also called for reorienting the project away from 
defending against an allout soviet attack 
monahan director of the sdi project office in the pentagon 
told a house panel on april 4 that the cost of deploying star wars 
in its currently planned form is 553 billion not adjusted for 
the effects of inflation in the 1990s he said that was down from 
691 billion estimated in october 1988 before the pentagon decided 
to use brilliant pebbles instead of larger more costly 
interceptors 
monahan predicted the figure would fall even further but many 
critics challenge his arithmetic 
in his new book out of the cold robert mcnamara who 
served as defense secretary under former presidents john kennedy 
and lyndon johnson said star wars price tag could spiral to 
hundreds of billions of dollars which he called an enormous 
waste of resources 
rep john conyers jr dmich chairman of the house government 
operations committee cites a february report by the general 
accounting office that estimates it will take 123 billion to 
complete the current sdi plan in addition to the roughly 19 
billion that has been spent over the past seven years 
with eastern europe shedding the yoke of communism this 
extraordinary expenditure of taxpayer dollars seems more absurd 
then ever conyers said we are talking about a stupendous cost 
for a missile defense system that is only partially effective

mayor tom bradley is battered but politically 
alive a year after the biggest mess of his long public career but 
problems may lie ahead 
at one point it was thought the 72yearold mayor would be 
lucky to keep his job through 1989 because of questions about his 
finances and ethics 
i would say that there has been irreparable damage to the 
mayors reputation said councilman mike woo however the 
prophets of doom who predicted that mayor bradley would not last 
out last year have clearly been wrong 
the trouble for bradley started with reports he accepted 18000 
to serve as an adviser to far east national bank which was doing 
business with the city 
with scandal in the air bradley narrowly avoided a runoff in 
april 1989 and won an unprecedented fifth term over the next few 
months he was battered by allegations of unethical conduct 
culminating with an investigation by the city attorney 
bradley got more than a little help from the investigation 
which had bark but no legal bite the demise of the los angeles 
herald examiner which had aggressively investigated him and his 
own perpetually pleasant personality 
the mayors aides contend he weathered the controversy because 
he never did too much wrong in the first place and his problems 
were overblown in the media 
still bradley paid a price he disappointed even his strongest 
supporters when he accepted the adviser fees and hints are 
circulating that retirement may be a good idea when his term ends 
in 1993 
this wont be a stain on his record said labor leader bill 
robertson a longtime bradley backer he has enough time to make 
some significant progress on his projects i dont think anyone 
would question his right to retire if he so chooses 
a federal grand jury continues to conduct what appears to be a 
wideranging investigation of bradleys finances and a friend and 
business partner of the mayors has been charged with stealing 
money from a city task force 
bradley would not comment at length on the events of the last 
year leaving as he usually does the talking to his aides 
the mayor is a remarkable person in that he never wavers in 
his day to day outlook said chief of staff mark fabiani he 
stares straight ahead and moves straight down the road 
one chapter in the bradley affair was closed this month when the 
city council allowed treasurer leonard rittenberg to resign rather 
than be fired rittenberg had taken much of the responsibility for 
the mayors problems 
it was rittenbergs office that had made a 2 million deposit 
into the bank paying bradley then apparently tried to cover up the 
transaction by putting white eraser fluid over the ledger entry 
per the mayor 
in the months after bradleys nearmiss with a runoff election a 
year ago a city council committee held a series of dramatic 
hearings that exposed wrongdoing ineptitude and the apparent 
coverup in the treasurers office 
most on everyones mind was the release of the findings of city 
attorney james hahns investigation some city hall observers 
speculated at the time that a damaging report could abruptly end 
the mayors term 
but when it was released in september the report although 
critical of bradleys alleged ethical lapses found no grounds for 
prosecution 
bradley agreed to pay 20000 to settle allegations he failed to 
report financial holdings amounting to 160000 but he admitted no 
wrongdoing 
although the report said the findings were not a vindication of 
the mayors conduct bradley declared otherwise 
when all is said and done the inquiry confirms what i have 
said all along i did not engage in conflicts of interest i did 
not violate the publics trust he said 
still hanging over bradleys head is the grand jury probe of his 
business ties to eight banks thrifts and brokerages under 
scrutiny is possible insider trading and violation of federal laws 
aimed at political corruption 
bradleys political allies also have run into trouble among 
them juanita st john former head of the citys task force for 
africalos angeles relations pleaded innocent this month to 
embezzling nearly 200000

a compilation of agriculture department 
subsidies paid in 1989 shows 10 states accounted for about 60 
percent of 109 billion in direct payments to farmers 
the largest recipient was texas whose farmers received nearly 
125 billion iowa was next at 9812 million according to 
figures provided by the departments agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service 
rounding out the top 10 illinois 7259 million minnesota 
5999 million kansas 5873 million nebraska 5411 million 
wisconsin 5223 million north dakota 4739 million arkansas 
4397 million and california 3721 million 
payments to the 10 totaled approximately 649 billion and 
included all major programs handled by ascs such as deficiency 
payments for wheat feed grains and cotton emergency and disaster 
assistance and costsharing and annual rental under the 
conservation reserve program or crp 
collectively the 109 billion paid to farmers last year was 
down from about 145 billion in 1988 and the record 167 billion 
in 1987 department analysts say the payments will drop further in 
1990 
one factor has been the higher commodity prices that resulted 
from the reduced production caused by drought the last two years 
with higher market prices deficiency payments have been reduced 
among the programs administered by ascs feed grain deficiency 
payments accounted for more than 31 billion of the 1989 total 
cotton 118 billion wheat 6029 million and rice 671 
million 
the crp payments totaled 157 billion nationally while 
disaster payments added more than 27 billion 
farmers got 1811 million under the old agricultural 
conservation program or acp 11 million under a forestry 
incentive program about 8 million from the water bank to help 
preserve wetlands and almost 25 million to reduce colorado river 
salinity 
the mix of payments in 1989 varied greatly among the states and 
depended on the kind of crops and livestock operations involved 
cotton and rice are major crops in the south and california but 
not in the corn belt dairying is big in the upper midwest and new 
england but often is far down the list in other states 
for example the 125 billion collected by texas producers was 
led by 4161 million paid to as cotton deficiency payments 1641 
million for feed grains and 386 million for wheat 
texas also got 2235 million in disaster payments and 1564 
million under the crp the states total also included 501 
million in wool and mohair subsidies 
in iowa the runnerup feed grain deficiency payments totaled 
577 million while wheat was only 248032 last year disaster 
payments were 2189 million and crp was 1475 million iowans 
collected 784421 in wool payments 
kansas traditionally the leading wheat producer collected 
1036 million in wheat deficiency payments but that was second to 
1649 million under the feed grain program disaster payments 
totaled 1478 million and wool was shown at 592653 the crp 
provided 1541 million 
no cotton payments were made in kansas and iowa 
total direct farm payments in calendar 1989 under usda programs 
rounded in dollars for other states were

gaylord nelson the founder of earth day two 
decades ago looked out at the thousands who gathered at the foot 
of the capitol and talked of the job yet to be done to save the 
planet from pollution 
i dont want to come back here 20 years from now and have to 
tell your sons and daughters that you didnt do your duty 
nelson 74 told the throng that gathered sunday to join in the 
worldwide 20th birthday of earth day 
the daylong rally in the nations capital was one of many across 
the country and in 141 nations the numbers are staggering 
said denis hayes organizer of the anniversary events as the 
people on the national mall slowly began to scatter 
he said indications were that as many as 225 million people took 
part worldwide 
according to the us capitol police more than 125000 came to 
the us capitol to hear a string of environmental activists 
politicians and celebrities call for grassroots action to protect 
the environment 
thousands more strolled along other parts of the national mall 
and near an array of environmental exhibits including a 
25footlong section of a 7footthick tree bought from a sawmill 
in washington state that dates back more than 700 years to the 
days of marco polo it once was among the oldgrowth forests of the 
northwest that environmentalists are trying to preserve 
on earth day 1990 we hear the voice of the planet and demand 
that she be healed declared hayes chairman of earth day 90 
inc the group that led the 3 million effort to remember the 
original earth day two decades ago 
several environmental activists blasted president bush for 
staying away from the rally and going fishing in florida instead 
where is the president today hes gone fishing railed ruth 
caplan executive director of the environmental action foundation 
bush returned to washington late sunday from florida where he 
met with founders of a key west group reef relief which he 
singled out for its efforts to protect the coral reefs 
young people pushed against the barriers near the stage for a 
closer glimpse at celebrities such as actors tom cruise and richard 
gere and recording artist john denver further away people many in 
shorts and tshirts strolled in the warm sun 
we must change things we must pressure our political 
leaders declared cruise who portrayed vietnam veteran activist 
ron kovic in the movie born on the fourth of july 
fifteenyearold mariah bauer said she hadnt yet seen cruise or 
any of the other celebrities but was glad she had come 
we wanted to help save the earth to do our part she said 
to becky lopez 15 and sonja goepfert 20 it was largely a day 
of work wearing yellow rubber gloves they were among about 200 
volunteers who collected trash discarded by the crowd into paper 
collection bags and separated it for recycling 
our aim is to get 95 percent of the trash here recycled 
said goepfert 
farther down the mall margaret shumaker a mother of three 
could barely hear the speeches and songs as she changed the diapers 
of noah 1 using cloth diapers instead of the plastic disposables 
disliked by many environmentalists because they do not degrade in 
landfills 
we wouldnt show up without them the cloth diapers said 
debbie wills we couldnt show our faces 
what brought the group to the rally 
because we like the earth said zachary shumaker 7

pope john paul ii used a historic visit to 
czechoslovakia to call for an unprecedented europeanwide meeting 
of bishops and said on his way home that he wants his church to 
play a key role in shaping a new europe 
the church has something to say and something to give as 
former communist countries in eastern europe move toward democracy 
and freedom of worship the pope said sunday night as he returned 
to rome 
a vatican spokesman also announced that the pope has accepted an 
invitation to visit cuba in december 
the pontiff said he hoped his 2day visit to czechoslovakia 
can open new doors to relations between the east and west and 
toward european unification it was his first trip to a warsaw 
pact country other than his native poland 
he called the meeting or synod of europes nearly 1000 
bishops out of 3000 worldwide to discuss spreading the 
churchs message across a continent transformed by the toppling of 
communist regimes 
the synod will apparently map a church strategy to meet the 
popes vision of a europe that is united on the basis of its 
christian roots and whose peoples reject materialistic tendencies 
in favor of spiritual values 
no date or location was specified for the gathering 
at an outdoor mass which drew several hundred thousand faithful 
on a raindrenched field in the slovak capital of bratislava on 
sunday the pope lauded the perseverance of the countrys 
longsuppressed roman catholics 
he also gave special thanks to czechoslovakias youth who 
sparked the peaceful november revolution that toppled the former 
communists rulers of a country that is twothirds catholic 
i am thinking of the young people whom others tried to lead 
astray but who did not lose their thirst for truth justice and 
love and who in the light of such values became the agents of 
recent changes he said 
the 69yearold pope made his announcement of a european synod 
as he visited a moravian shrine in the city of velehrad 90 miles 
from bratislava the shrine was dedicated to cyril and methodius 
two patron saints of europe 
we could find no better occasion for an announcement that 
intimately concerns this continent which throughout the centuries 
has been torn by wars but also blessed with a presence and work of 
countless saints who sowed the gospel seeds far and wide he said 
john paul said the synod would be held at a nottoodistant 
date but a papal spokesman joaquin navarro said the meeting 
probably would not be held this year he said details would be 
announced in rome on tuesday 
to my mind the agenda for the synod will be huge navarro 
said it will be the first such european church summit bringing 
together bishops from every country on the continent 
since european communist regimes started crumbling last year 
the vatican has been moving quickly to expand its influence in the 
region 
poland was the first to restore diplomatic relations with the 
holy see that countrys first postwar noncommunist premier 
tadeusz mazowiecki attended the papal mass in velehrad and kissed 
the pontiffs ring 
after celebrating a mass at velehrad attended by some 200000 
people the pope flew on to bratislava for another huge openair 
service that was the final big event of his trip 
at that mass was deputy prime minister jan carnogursky a slovak 
and the emerging leader of the increasingly ambitious christian 
democratic movement which is expected to do well in parliamentary 
elections set for june 89 
the movement was expected to reap political benefits from the 
popes visit and carnogursky even read during the mass 
also prominent at the service was parliament speaker alexander 
dubcek the former communist party leader whose 1968 prague 
spring reforms prompted the warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia and a restoration of hardline policies 
the vatican estimates 107 million catholics live in the country 
of 156 million 
the trip was the popes 46th foreign tour next month he is 
scheduled to visit mexico and malta and he plans a tour of africa 
in september and a stop in cuba in december

police officers posing as taxi drivers are 
cruising for the killers of seven cabbies 
with the slaying of two drivers over the weekend mayor david 
dinkins ordered police to step up the investigation into the 
killings as part of the police probe undercover officers are 
working as cab drivers 
the body of the sixth driver killed in the bronx since march 7 
was found sunday and another driver was shot to death in brooklyn 
on saturday 
after meeting sunday with police commissioner lee brown dinkins 
called the seven slayings a public crisis and a threat to the 
entire city 
police have said they believe one killer was responsible for 
three of the slayings in the bronx they were investigating whether 
the two weekend deaths might also be related 
certainly theres some similarities lt donald f 
stephenson said of sundays shooting 
the victim had been shot in the head the man whose name was 
not released was believed to be a gypsy driver or one who 
illegally picks up passengers on the street only medallion cabs 
or yellow cabs may do that 
on saturday afternoon a gypsy cab driver ferdinand charlie 
jeannot was shot in brooklyn through a plastic partition by a 
backseat passenger police said they speculated the gunman may 
have planned to rob jeannot but couldnt reach his wallet 
containing 100 because the front doors were locked 
the three related shootings in the bronx all within a mile 
involved drivers who were called late at night to pick up a 
passenger police said ballistics tests have shown the bullets 
were from the same 22caliber gun police think robbery was the 
motive 
the mayor said in ordered brown to expand a 30member task force 
assigned to find the killer or killers 
these killings represent more than a brutal attack on the 
drivers who have fallen victim dinkins said they have also 
become an assault on a vital link in our transportation system 
nonmedallion cabs are used most often by people in upper 
manhattan and the outer boroughs where yellow cabs are hard to 
find 
at least 32 cabbies were killed on the job last year so far 
this year nine cab drivers have been slain 
a reward of 20000 has been offered for information about the 
bronx cabbies killer or killers

a gaunt pale robert polhill was freed 
sunday by proiranian shiite moslem militants in beirut after 1182 
days as a hostage and he said his anger kept him alive 
the iranian foreign minister was quoted as saying the shiite 
movements in lebanon wanted a prompt reciprocal move for freeing 
polhill but president bush said he would make no deals with the 
kidnappers 
an iranian newspaper close to iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani said monday that the lebanese kidnappers should release 
another american hostage immediately without conditions 
polhill was the first american hostage to be released in nearly 
3 years 
polhill 55 of new york was freed near the seaside summerland 
hotel in moslem west beirut at 515 pm 1115 am edt and 
driven immediately to damascus where he was turned over to us 
ambassador edward djerejian 
i want to tell you im a very happy man tonight polhill 
told a news conference in damascus looking dazed but elated im 
am sorry i kept you waiting so long thirtynine months is a long 
time 
on monday he and his lebanese wife feryal flew from the 
syrian capital in a us air force c141 plane to rheinmain air 
base just outside frankfurt west germany 
at the base he was helped down stairs from the plane by two 
men waved to reporters and was escorted to an olive green military 
van 
polhill was then to head by helicopter to nearby wiesbaden 
where he was to undergo medical checks and a debriefing by us 
intelligence officers at a us military hospital before returning 
to the united states 
other american captives freed in the past have also gone there 
bush thanked syria and iran for their roles in freeing polhill 
and called for the release of all the hostages he said the united 
states would make no deals with hostage takers 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati was quoted early 
monday as saying the proiranian extremists in lebanon wanted a 
quick reciprocal move the official syrian arab news agency 
quoting velayati in new york specified the release of sheik abdul 
karim obeid a lebanese shiite clergyman abducted by israeli 
soldiers in july 
seventeen western hostages remain missing in lebanon including 
seven americans polhill a professor of business studies and 
accounting at beirut university college and two other us 
educators jesse turner and alann steen were held by the islamic 
jihad for the liberation of palestine 
in a syrian tv interview polhill said he was grateful to those 
who helped him but added im still deeply concerned about my 
two friends and others who are still held in the conditions i was 
held in 
polhill said he played cards with other hostages during his 
captivity and tried to keep his mind off the possibility of freedom 
i strived to continue to be angry knowing at all times that 
if i began to lose that anger i would just sort of become a 
vegetable and i didnt want that to happen he said in the 
interview 
the terms of the release which followed a series of communiques 
from the shiite moslem kidnappers were not known 
guards outside the summerland who witnessed the release said 
polhill stepped out of a car that screeched to a halt about 50 
yards from the hotel 
he was immediately picked up by a threecar syrian convoy and 
driven off at high speed 
the syrian tv footage showed polhill being driven through 
beirut sitting in the back of a car and puffing heavily on a 
cigarette he appeared drawn after his long ordeal and smiled wanly 
several times 
at his news conference polhill gaunt and pale said he was too 
tired to answer any questions about seven other american hostages 
or his captivity by the proiranian islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine since jan 24 1987 
standing beside polhill djerejian said we will keep 
communication lines open to all parties that have influence with 
the hostage takers we are going to continue doing everything we 
can we are going to continue talking to continue trying 
also speaking at the news conference syrias foreign minister 
farouk alsharaa said he hoped polhills release will lead to 
other hostage releases 
in an editorial in mondays editions the tehran times newspaper 
said another hostage should be freed to test president bushs 
claim that goodwill begets goodwill 
this they should do swiftly in order to leave the ball in the 
other partys court to demonstrate its goodwill if it has any 
said the englishlanguage newspaper which often reflects 
rafsanjanis views 
bush on a fishing trip in florida said all american hostages 
must be free before the united states will reciprocate with a 
goodwill gesture 
i dont trade for hostages he said 
polhills mother ruth polhill of fishkill ny was overjoyed 
at news of the release and the prospect of seeing her son 
maybe ill have control of myself by that time she told cnn 
polhill and steen a native of boston who turned 51 on sunday 
and turner 42 of boise idaho were kidnapped from the beirut 
university college campus by gunmen disguised as police officers 
the last american hostage to be freed was david jacobsen former 
director of the american university hospital in beirut he was 
kidnapped in beirut on may 28 1985 was released nov 2 1986 
he had been held by another shiite faction islamic jihad or 
isamic holy war 
in libya sunday col moammar gadhafi also called for the 
release of hostages in an appeal to moslems around the world the 
official libyan news agency jana said 
the first word of an impending hostage release came wednesday 
when the kidnappers announced they would free one captive in 48 
hours 
but on thursday the captors indefinitely postponed the release 
after bush refused to send john kelly assistant secretary of state 
for near east affairs to damascus as the kidnappers had demanded 
syria as it moves back to the arab mainstream after years of 
isolation apparently wants to improve its image in the west and 
hopes that mediating the release of us hostages will persuade the 
united states to eventually take it off the list of countries 
sponsoring terrorism 
in iran rafsanjani and some of the more pragmatic politicians 
are apparently want to improve ties with the west 
the longest held western hostage is terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

rooted beneath the buzzing blades of a 
marine helicopter president bush gave some anxious moments to 
secret service agents whose job it is to protect him 
one white house staffer joked afterward that it was the closest 
vice president dan quayle had ever come to being president 
the setting was the landing strip where bush bade farewell to 
visiting french president francois mitterrand after a day of talks 
at nearby key largo 
bushs limousine pulled up right next to the waiting helicopter 
and the two leaders emerged and shook hands 
when mitterrand climbed aboard the helicopter bush stepped back 
about 10 feet and planted himself behind his armored car 
the helicopter pilot delayed starting his engine waiting for 
bush to leave but the president didnt move 
finally the aircrafts huge blades began turning faster and 
faster throwing out great gusts of wind 
bush held his ground leaning forward against the stormlike 
weather clutching a strap inside the car for balance 
a secret service agent next to bush suggested he get in the 
limo the president ignored him the agent tried again same 
response 
bush seemed oblivious to the noise the wind and any danger 
with his hair blowing and sport coat flapping in the wind he 
waved repeatedly to mitterrand until the helicopter finally climbed 
into the air and took him away 
seeming exhilarated bush got in his car and left 
helicopter drama aside bushs meeting with mitterrand provided 
an extraordinary look at an array of presidential body language 
after hours of talks they appeared together on an outdoor stage 
for a news conference 
bush opened with an eightminute statement he stopped every few 
moments to allow the remarks to be translated into french 
when it was his turn mitterrand droned on for 21 minutes 
including translation and when it came time for the questions and 
answers the french leader was always more longwinded than bush 
it clearly put bushs patience to a test 
he fidgeted and rubbed his jaw he grimaced and set his teeth in 
a smile several times bush twisted around to the back of stage as 
if to seek relief from his press secretary marlin fitzwater 
standing nearby 
bush occasionally caught the eye of reporters in the audience 
who made no attempt to hide their distress at mitterrands 
soliloquies bush smiled and lowered his eyes 
fitzwater later described the session as the longest 
presidential news conference in memory a full 72 minutes in fact 
he ducked out early on to smear on some suntan lotion 
the next day bush boasted about his endurance 
i was very polite the president said i was thinking of 
media adviser roger ailes keep eye contact 
the day after mitterrand left bush settled into islamorada for 
a weekend of fishing he didnt do very well the first day but said 
he fared better the second day he offered no specifics 
while the fish may have avoided the president the tourists 
didnt 
when bush strolled onto a beach at sunrise on earth day for an 
environmental ceremony on sunday he was greeted by two women 
humming hail to the chief 
bush smiled at the familiar strain and said thank you he 
added for the benefit of other onlookers the marine band is over 
there 
it was a spurofthemoment performance the women said 
afterward 
if i had planned it i would have brought kazoos from school 
but i didnt think far enough in advance said barbara wilt 38 
an elementary school music teacher from orlando 
sarah seay 42 of altamont springs fla asked bush afterward 
how did you like our singing 
he just looked and went wahhhh she laughed pantomiming 
bush shaking his hand in a soso gesture

when nicaraguan president daniel ortega steps 
down on wednesday he will join a rapidly growing but still 
exclusive club 
over the past year and a half wrathful voters in about a dozen 
latin american countries have rebelled against their declining 
living standards by voting incumbent parties out of office in 
nicaragua voters repudiated the revolutionary left elsewhere 
more moderate parties were turned out of power 
in some ways the throw the bums out mentality in latin 
america parallels what occurred last year in eastern europe 
in both regions the trend generally has been toward reducing 
the state role in the economy and adoption of free market 
principles 
but the political upheaval in latin america has been far less 
dramatic than in the east bloc it has taken place not on the 
streets but in the quiet of the voting booth 
ortegas defeat by violeta chamorro on feb 25 was just the 
latest example of central american voters opting for the more 
conservative alternative the pattern has been similar in elections 
in el salvador honduras and costa rica over the past year 
in south america similar examples can be cited in brazil and 
uruguay in the recent election in peru the large majority of the 
votes went to either centrist or rightist candidates leaving the 
nominee of the ruling centerleft party trailing badly 
in chile despite high economic growth rates voters turned 
against 15 years of military rule in 1988 the countrys newly 
elected leadership has promised not to tamper significantly with 
the conservative economic policies of the previous government 
in venezuela argentina ecuador and jamaica the presidents 
were elected as populists but are pursuing economic policies that 
are far more conservative than what they promised during the 
campaign 
in mexico the partido revolucionario institucional is still in 
charge but not without receiving a scare from the voters two years 
ago 
president carlos salinas de gortari is winning praise from 
washington for his efforts to revitalize the mexican economy 
through marketoriented approaches 
throughout the hemisphere there is a recognition that the 
traditional way of doing things hasnt worked 
eva loser an analyst at the center for strategic and 
international studies says there is a widespread tendency to 
throw out what theyve been doing and try something new 
secretary of state james a baker iii has hailed the restoration 
of democracy in the hemisphere but says that breakthrough will be 
meaningless unless it leads to improved living standards 
economists look on the 1980s in latin america as the lost 
decade a time when production investment and consumption all 
dropped the number of latin americans in absolute poverty is 
believed to be far above 100 million 
in 1988 combined inflation in latin america was 420 percent 
when peruvians went to the polls several weeks ago prices were 
soaring at an annual rate of almost 3000 percent 
some countries have had to earmark up to half their export 
earnings for foreign debt payments the declining economies in many 
countries were the result of rockbottom prices for export 
commodities 
that is a problem local governments cannot influence but other 
maladies are homegrown 
douglas payne director of hemispheric affairs for freedom 
house a prodemocracy group based in new york said economic 
stagnation in the hemisphere is partly the result of monopoly 
regulation and protectionism 
more recently he said these problems have been compounded by 
interventionist development policies that created huge 
moneyguzzling state corporations and corrupt nowork 
bureaucracies 
one of the more interesting contests shaping up in the short 
term is expected within the next year in guyana 
there the moderate ruling party will be squaring off against a 
party led by an oldline marxist cheddi jagan who for now is 
the favorite to win

the nonstop rise in college tuition coupled 
with the prospect of major cuts in americas troop strength is 
prompting calls for expanded benefits under veterans educational 
program known as the montgomery gi bill 
the congressional committees that deal with veteran affairs 
recently recommended that veterans secretary edward j derwinski 
propose raising the maximum monthly gi bill benefit 
the pentagon and armed services groups are looking at how the 
program can help ease the impact of demobilization on service 
members who had planned on a military career 
since 1985 the monthly benefit for veterans who pursue fulltime 
study has stood at 300 for a maximum 36 months tuition at public 
institutions has risen 6 percent to 7 percent annually since then 
and is expected to keep rising the pentagon says 
tuition for all highereducation institutions including 
twoyear colleges cost 6800 in 1988 the department of education 
says 
if the program were indexed the benefit would be 464 monthly 
says richard l johnson of the non commissioned officers 
association his figure is based on a pentagon test program 
rep gv sonny montgomery chairman of the house veterans 
affairs committee asked the va in a letter march 26 to raise the 
monthly benefit under his namesake bill to 400 in fiscal 1992 the 
senate va committee gave no dollar figure in its budget 
recommendation 
johnson says the benefits are becoming more critical because of 
pentagon plans to cut military strength the army where gi bill 
enrollment is the highest would drop from 764000 to 580000 
members by 1997 under the latest pentagon plan 
the big concern i have is when we look back through 1970 to 
1975 we had a gi bill that could reasonably support an individual 
who had a wife and child said johnson that would be impossible 
now he said 
under the gi bill then in place the last wartime and draftera 
bill the benefit for a veteran with no dependents rose from 130 a 
month in 1967 to 342 in january 1981 veterans with dependents 
received more 
usage for any gi bill since the program began after world war ii 
peaked in 1976 when 28 million people received training most in 
college 
johnsons concern has also been expressed in the pentagon where 
lt col otis elam says weve been looking at that very hard 
his concern is with the longerterm service member 
when they get out they may not have a job opportunity and may 
need benefits for school said elam associate director for 
education and officer procurement policy in the defense department 
paradoxically a program that was tailored to attract 
highquality recruits and keep them in the service will have to be 
used to ease people out and no one has any idea what impact 
demobilization will have on the present budget projections for the 
program 
the reagan administration had tried to end the program in its 
1987 budget proposal substituting an earlier less popular 
peacetime version the administration said at the time the bill had 
achieved its purpose 
the montgomery gi bill took form amid a debate over how to 
restore the strength and quality of the armed services because of 
that concern the program has incentives for staying in the 
activeduty military or reserves 
under the montgomery bill service members are automatically 
enrolled unless they elect to opt out within two weeks after 
entering the service participants have 100 a month deducted from 
their pay for the first 12 months of service which they do not get 
back if they do not go to school after leaving the service 
as a result of these deductions the pentagon has saved 1 
billion in payroll costs since july 1985 the benefits the bulk of 
which come out of the va budget are only now beginning to be paid 
in large numbers 
the va has predicted that usage of the 300 monthly benefit will 
peak in 1995 and that from then to the turn of the century nearly 
250000 participants will collect about 500 million dollars each 
year or about 1900 each

an army of census workers is about to start 
chasing answers from millions of americans a task that in past 
years occasionally meant fleeing from dogs and goats changing 
diapers and helping hang wash 
its never routine knocking doortodoor says fred borsa 
the man in charge of training the 330000 census workers who will 
hit the streets on thursday 
goats bulls dogs and roosters are among the animals that have 
routed the citizencounters in the past 
but pleasant experiences occur also for example one census 
worker reported that while she was interviewing the residents of a 
household the family cat brought her four kittens into the room and 
placed them at the feet of the enumerator 
animals arent included in the census but the bureau does want 
to count the millions of americans who havent returned their 
census forms whether they were lost ignored or never arrived 
the bureau has faced a barrage of criticism in recent weeks 
following reports that whole towns failed to receive the forms 
mailed out in late march some 48 million forms were 
undeliverable in addition people who did get forms have not 
responded as well as the bureau hoped 
as a result the cost of taking the census is expected to run 
150 million to 190 million above estimates as more people must 
be hired for the doortodoor count the canvass had been expected 
to cost 13 billion 
past census workers have found people living in converted 
chicken coops tin huts old boxcars mine tunnels and lofts most 
folks are cooperative according to workers in previous counts 
workers have helped with babies and washing fought fires and 
discovered sick elderly people who had to be taken to hospitals 
census workers are told to leave the area if trouble arises but 
most people cooperate once a census enumerator gets to the front 
door borsa said although they dont always want to let a worker 
indoors 
sometimes people wont let you in the house and there you 
are standing in the rain trying to conduct an interview he 
explained 
borsa recalled an incident involving an irate woman in 
albuquerque she was upset that her husband was unemployed and she 
didnt see how answering census questions was going to do her any 
good he said 
the enumerator took some time was very patient she explained 
the benefits to the local community how it was important for 
people to cooperate he said after a few minutes the woman 
decided to talk and provided the requested information 
its not unusual for workers to get invited into peoples homes 
for dinner the bureau reports 
the bureau tries to hire people to work in their home towns and 
even in their home apartment buildings where possible borsa said 
local people are more readily trusted he explained and know their 
way around a neighborhood 
census workers get two and onehalf days of training including 
some field practice before being sent out on their own borsa said 
patience and resilience can be important qualities for a census 
worker 
in one instance a census worker climbed onto the porch of a farm 
home and asked the resident if the house needed any repairs 
promptly the porch collapsed around her 
one woman told a census worker it was her first visitor in two 
years 
when people refuse to cooperate the enumerators crew leader 
makes one last attempt to get an interview said borsa 
then if all else fails they talk to neighbors and record what 
they can observe from outside about how many people seem to be in 
the residence

when house speaker thomas s foley and his 
democratic team marched into the news conference to announce their 
budget everything was in place the cameras the press releases 
the package of rhetoric 
everything that is except the budget as planned 
the democrats didnt hold their news conference last week to 
give detailed designs for how the government could operate better 
next year 
for years theyd said their budgets were superior to the 
reaganbush blueprints with lower deficits and more innovative 
programs but the public still believed the republicans were more 
trustworthy keepers of the federal balance sheet 
this time the democrats werent going to get bogged down 
explaining the arcane details the white house realized years ago 
that nobody outside washington cares about that stuff 
so budget not in hand the democrats announced their plan was 
the rebuild america budget a budget with vision and that 
in contrast with president bushs plan it invests in the 
economic strength of america and our working families 
after foley dwash and the other party leaders left house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta explained how that worked 
bushs defense budget would be cut and the money spent instead on 
welfare programs education job training etc in short 
traditional democratic party priorities 
panetta released the actual budget the following day and 
without fanfare it was passed by his committee on a partyline 
vote full house debate is expected to start late this week 
the news conference wednesday was only the first step in the 
democrats longrange media strategy for their budget which most 
expect will ultimately be reduced to a bargaining position for 
talks with bush 
the budget left to its own devices is an impenetrable 
subject says david dreyer communications director for house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
the group of democrats organized by gephardt to criticize the 
president regularly on such issues as foreign policy and the 
environment will add the budget to their repertoire the key 
message the changes in eastern europe mean its now prudent to 
trim military spending for americas needs and bush is behind the 
curve 
that the budget is a political battle is nothing new but in the 
past it has been treated as the most serious and weighty of tasks 
sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill each step a hurdle 
house democrats decided this year to play down the tedious 
manufacturing process and instead present the public with a 
product a sort of budget lite easier to digest 
weve been thinking like that all year said one top 
leadership aide its a realization with everything we do we 
have to be able to tell a story to the american people 
theres no way that the congressional democrats can command news 
media coverage the way the white house can 
the president dominates coverage when he releases his budget 
and bush needs only to hint at a change in one of his budget 
stances such as a tax increase and hes got international 
attention with financial markets moving 
by contrast last weeks democratic budget undoubtedly closer 
than bushs proposal will be to the final fiscal 1991 plan 
garnered little time on radio and television and few big headlines 
but the democrats are willing to take what they can get and are 
willing to change the way things are done to get it in hopes of a 
longterm payoff 
id rather take a balanced story on page 13 than a blast on 
page one said the leadership aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the onus is on us dreyer said

blacks are more likely than whites to be 
victims of violent crimes such as aggravated assault rape and 
robbery according to a federal study 
the rate of such violent crimes occurring against black 
americans age 12 or older was 44 per 1000 compared with 34 per 
1000 whites in the same age group according to data collected by 
the justice departments national crime survey between 1979 and 
1986 
there were 13 robberies per 1000 blacks during the sevenyear 
period compared with five robberies per 1000 whites the study 
said the rate of aggravated assaults was 14 per 1000 blacks and 9 
per 1000 whites there were 15 rapes per 1000 black women 
compared with 08 rapes per 1000 white women 
whites were more likely to be victims of simple assault with a 
rate of 19 per 1000 compared to 16 simple assaults per 1000 
blacks 
blacks were more likely to be physically attacked or threatened 
with violence than whites during the commission of a crime the 
study said 
among victims of aggravated assault 48 percent were black 
while 41 percent were white 
in addition blacks were more likely to be attacked by someone 
holding a knife gun or some other weapon

timothy and paula whisman thought their 
hands would be full with two demanding infants by now instead 
their arms are aching to hold one newborn daughter who clings to 
life because of her twin brothers heart 
alison page whisman was born april 10 with a fatal heart 
condition her brother tyler was born brain dead minutes later 
doctors saved the girls life by giving her tylers heart in what 
they believe is the first heart transplant between infant twins 
we just want to have her where we can hold her and feed her 
and all those things that you do with a baby mrs whisman said 
i just want to get her where i can have some snugglies 
page as her parents call her is in the newborn intensive 
care unit at riley hospital for children she is hooked to a 
heartlung monitor 
dr randall caldwell medical director of the riley pediatric 
cardiac transplantation program said page had hypoplastic left 
heart syndrome a fatal congenital abnormality that occurs in about 
one in 6000 births 
without help infants with the condition die within 15 days 
drugs can forestall death for about 45 days researchers dont know 
what causes the condition which develops about four to nine weeks 
after conception 
the whismans have been told that if page continues improving 
they can take her home within three weeks for now they make the 
hourlong commute daily from their home in cicero ind about 20 
miles from indianapolis to visit page 
its limited the time we can spend with her she was really 
alert today and her eyes were bright she knows when her lullabies 
were playing mrs whisman said in a telephone interview sunday 
night 
the twins were artificially conceived in august because the 
whismans had been unable to conceive on their own 
page was born one minute before tyler he was born brain dead 
asphyxiated in the womb just before birth doctors said page 
appeared strong at delivery but doctors discovered the heart 
defect within 12 hours 
the whismans had the idea for a transplant 
it was just a passing thing i had made the comment that 
wouldnt it be amazing if it was up to tyler to save his sisters 
life said mrs whisman 40 who began taking fertility drugs in 
july when she had difficulty getting pregnant 
because the twins were not identical the chances of an organ 
match werent certain but in four of the six compatibility factors 
that surgeons test for the twins matched 
when page is old enough mrs whisman said she will be told of 
her brothers gift of life 
weve got pictures of tyler well tell her we think its 
real important that she know that it was her brother that saved her 
life she said 
the whismans also decided to donate tylers liver to a 
pennsylvania newborn even if the tissues hadnt matched to help 
page we would have still wanted his life to touch someone else to 
help someone else mrs whisman said 
she said the couple believes the unique operation represents 
even more than the life of their daughter 
each time its done they learn more and maybe itll make 
things easier for the next little baby out there who has the same 
problem page has

clayton williams spokesman says the 
republican gubernatorial candidates admission that he patronized 
prostitutes as a young man demonstrates his greatest strength 
honesty 
democrat ann richards campaign charged that williams remarks 
raise new questions about the 58yearold oilmanranchers 
attitudes toward women 
the houston post reported sunday that williams admitted 
patronizing prostitutes in texas and mexico as a teenager and as a 
student at texas aampm university he said it had been at least 35 
years since he had done so 
ive never claimed to be a perfect man williams told the 
newspaper its part of growing up in west texas its like 
the larry mcmurtry book the last picture show 
he added it was a lot different in those days the houses 
were the only place you got serviced then 
williams press secretary bill kenyon trying to turn the remark 
to the candidates advantage said one of claytons greatest 
strengths as a person is one of his greatest weaknesses as a 
politician he always tries to be honest 
kenyon said that williams had answered a reporters question by 
telling the truth even when it wasnt politically expedient 
williams was in arizona and not available for comment 
in recent months the republican nominee has made several 
comments which taken together drive this wedge between men and 
women and i think thats unfortunate said glenn smith ms 
richards campaign manager 
smith said the state treasurer who was vacationing didnt wish 
to comment on williams statement 
smith said williams has made a series of remarks about women 
that should be a topic of debate he implies that women are here 
to service men that kind of an attitude is as insulting to men 
as it is to women smith said 
a month ago williams came under fire for a remark during a 
cattle roundup on his ranch williams likened bad weather to rape 
and said that if it is inevitable just relax and enjoy it he 
apologized the next day 
during a visit to washington before the democratic runoff 
williams told reporters he would feel uncomfortable running against 
a woman 
prostitution is legal in some areas of mexico including most 
border cities prostitutes must have health cards and undergo 
weekly checkups in mexico city and some other areas prostitution 
is illegal but tolerated 
ms richards won the democratic nomination on april 10 after a 
mudslinging campaign in which her opponent attorney general jim 
mattox accused her of using illegal drugs as recently as 10 years 
ago 
a recovering alcoholic ms richards declined to give a 
yesorno answer when asked about drug use

young has become so weary of lollygagging attorneys and other 
court officials that hes imposed a fine for tardiness even 
penalizing himself three times 
the minimum mandatory for latecomers a transformer or teenage 
mutant ninja turtle will do just fine 
those fined must bring a toy to court 
the real thing i want people to learn is i expect them to be 
on time to keep their calendars in order and to keep things 
moving he said at the same time there are a lot of children 
who can benefit from something like this 
when the pile of toys behind the judges bench gets too high 
they are taken to local charities 
lawyer bob merdith who was overdue for a hearing was the

hey i got nailed but i thought well ill be glad to

milton graton says there are quicker ways 
to pull a 70000pound bridge into place than with two oxen and 
wooden rollers but there isnt a better way 
hundreds of residents watched the animals inch the 
coveredbridge builders latest masterpiece onto its foundations 
over the weekend 
its the difference between doing it the right way and the 
wrong way the 81yearold said saturday it takes longer to do 
it the right way 
with the yoked oxen strolling in circles to turn a capstan the 
60footlong 14footwide bridge was pulled in place using chains 
500 feet of heavy rope and an old block and tackle 
each time the oxen made a circle the bridge slid forward about 
three inches on wooden rollers 
though the process was about as lively as watching corn grow 
marion merrill of the ashland historical societys squam river 
covered bridge association said its nice to show people how it 
was done years ago 
its a great engineering feat she said we today think we 
have all the knowledge and they didnt have it years ago 
the state had proposed a 11 million steelandconcrete span to 
replace a condemned concrete bridge over the squam river but in 
1988 town selectmen entered into an oral agreement with graton 
thats the only way he does business to build the bridge for 
189000 the coveredbridge association raised about 200000 in 
donations for the project 
graton and associates operated by milton and one of his three 
sons arnold 52 began construction last year 
arnold graton said the oldfashioned bridge is just what youd 
expect to find in a town like ashland 
you dont go play golf on a cement golf course with plastic 
grass he said

the dollar edged lower against the japanese yen 
today while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange also fell in 
listless trading 
the dollar closed at 15755 yen down 005 yen from its 15760 
yen close on friday it opened at 15740 yen and traded between 
15705 yen and 15758 yen 
currency dealings were dominated by cross trading between the 
yen and the west german mark that kept the dollaryen rate fairly 
stable dealers said 
kaneo ogino senior dealer with goldman sachs in tokyo said the 
yen was likely to remain weak against the mark ahead of a may 6 
decision on unifying the east and west german currencies 
the yen also is being weakened by speculation over possible west 
german and us interest rate increases that would enhance the 
appeal of the mark and dollar dealers said 
the dollar meanwhile is expected to remain in a box 
trading between 155 and 160 yen ogino said 
dealers said it was hard to determine the dollars direction 
because no incentives were driving the currency 
at the same time there is speculation that the us acceptance 
of a weak yen is waning because of fears of a deterioration in the 
trade imbalance they said the weak yen makes japanese exports 
more price competitive overseas 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues fell 15637 points or 052 percent closing at 2967907 
it lost 10997 points friday 
an estimated 330 million shares changed hands in thin trading 
analysts predicted little movement in prices ahead of the 
golden week holidays japans financial markets will be closed 
next monday thursday and friday for the series of holidays 
people are in a holiday mood said christopher leighton 
manager of international sales at schroder securities 
a temporary equilibrium was believed to exist in all three 
major financial markets bond currency and equities and no 
one wants to disturb it he said 
the equilibrium level for the nikkei was believed to be 30000 
points for the dollar 160 yen and for the benchmark japanese 
government bond a yield of about 73 percent leighton added 
the price of benchmark no 119 10year japanese government bonds 
declined to 8619 points as of 4 pm from fridays close at 8636 
the yield stood at 7325 percent up from 729 percent

television interview with released american hostage robert polhill 
on sunday night 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q how do you feel after being released 
a im very happy and grateful to all the people who spent time 
on my case im still deeply concerned about my two friends and 
others who are still held in the conditions i was held in 
some of them have been held longer than me my happiness tonight 
is a bit toned down that theyre not with me im looking forward 
that well be together again all of us 
i dont know where im going i think its better you ask me 
specific questions im not sure i cant summarize 39 months of my 
life its a little bit difficult at this moment i didnt have 
time to begin relecting yet on those 39 months of my life 
q how was your first day in captivity 
a i remember my first day in captivity more than the rest of my 
days in captivity it was boring we were kept away to ensure 
the security of our being kept 
that prevented us from doing anything we were not allowed to 
speak loudly we had something to read but we were deprived 
materials that gave any news about us 
as to our specific conditions i can tell you it could have been 
a lot worse we were not maltreated thanks to those who guarded 
us who tried to give us things within the limits of the 
restrictions on them we played cards 
we were very much in the dark about our status we didnt know 
where we stood that was the worst we didnt know whether we were 
going to be released and when or whether we were ever going to be 
released 
in fact i know that those left behind and others still in 
captivity in places im not aware of quite possibly dont know 
that ive been released but i guess theyll have hope if they know 
ive been released 
q what does freedom mean to you 
a freedom is something that believe it or not neither me nor 
my two associates spent a lot of time thinking about its a bit 
like you wish you had a tbone steak in front of you 
knowing you were not going to get it right away makes you more 
hungry makes you want that steak more so we didnt spend time 
thinking or talking about when wed be freed 
our most difficult assignment was to find things to think about 
to keep our minds active so we didnt begin to vegetate i dont 
know what psychologists say about this my belief is that part of 
the symptom of a mind beginning to stray and go bad to the point of 
danger is the loss of anger 
i was angry at what was done to me at being taken away from my 
wife and family my friends and students and so i strived to 
continue to be angry knowing at all times that if i began to lose 
that anger i would just sort of become a vegetable and i didnt 
want that to happen 
q what do you want to say to the world 
a one thing i probably should say is that i was a little bit 
surprised to find out that the specific demand these men the 
kidnappers are making and want the world to know seems to be 
precisely the same they made about two weeks after our kidnapping 
when alann steen made the videotape releasing the 400 prisoners 
held in israeli jails we seem right back at ground zero 
one of the last words i heard today from one of them as they 
went out was that was still their demand i dont know if its 
still the same 400 prisoners or others 
besides that i dont think i have any other messages that im 
supposed to be carrying to the people or governments of the world 
or the united nations as i say this is rather surprising 
id have thought things would have changed over the three years 
that some of those prisoners got released i dont know 
q what are your plans for the future 
a i really dont have any plans for the future yet except to 
see my wife mother sons and friends and family people i havent 
seen in three years or 39 months and together talk about things 
like that about the future

oklahoma teachers realize they will be held 
accountable for better schools after a fourday strike that won 
them the biggest education funding bill in state history union 
officials say 
the walkout ended with the legislature approving the 230 
million bill on thursday most teachers were back in class the next 
day schools that did not reopen friday were expected to resume 
classes today 
teachers realize the bill is just a first step and is not 
going to solve all the problems of education karla feeley 
spokeswoman for the 31000member oklahoma education association 
said sunday 
teachers celebrating at a union meeting friday and saturday 
were euphoric and sharing their happiness and talking about the 
need to get down to it and make it happen she said 
the strike began last monday to protest legislative inaction on 
the bill which calls for raising 230 million by increasing sales 
and income taxes 
a onehalf cent increase in the 4cent state sales tax would 
raise 104 million as would a 10 percent increase in personal 
income taxes an increase in the corporate tax from 5 percent to 6 
percent would produce 22 million 
the bill calls for spending 681 million to raise minimum 
teacher salaries by 1500 a year for four years it also provides 
money for special education and early childhood development 
programs 
oklahoma teachers say they rank 48th in pay among the states 
making 22000 a year compared with the national average of 29648

two days of fighting between moslem separatists 
and chinese security forces in the countrys far west claimed 22 
lives the regions media said in reports that broke two weeks of 
official silence on the unrest 
the local television reports in the xinjiang uygur autonomous 
region said 15 moslem protesters a provincial official and six 
policemen were killed and 19 police wounded in the april 56 
clashes in akto county 
in its report sunday the station claimed militant separatists 
in the region had formed the islamic party of east turkistan and 
proclaimed a holy war to establish an independent republic 
akto county is 25 miles south of the ancient bazaar city of 
kashgar and less than 60 miles from the soviet border 
foreign travelers in xinjiangs capital of urumqi said at the 
time of the rioting that troops had been sent in to quell 
disturbances in kashgar and two other cities hotan and kuqa and 
that an estimated 50 people were killed 
the weekend television reports monitored by the british 
broadcasting corp did not mention unrest anywhere except aktos 
baren township 
the foreign sources said the rioting broke out after a dispute 
over the building of a mosque but xinjiang television called the 
clash in akto a premeditated counterrevolutionary armed 
rebellion and made no mention of the mosque dispute 
more than half of xinjiangs 14 million people are from moslem 
minority groups such as uygurs kazakhs taziks and kirghiz many 
with close cultural ties to the restive moslem nationalities of 
soviet central asia 
relations between moslems and han chinese in xinjiang have long 
been strained in may serious rioting broke out in urumqi when 
moslems angered by a chineselanguage book on moslem sexual habits 
stormed communist party headquarters 
in recent months xinjiang officials have repeatedly made 
unspecified warnings about the threat of separatists using 
religion to undermine the unity of the nation 
media reports have said the government is tightening controls 
over religious activities including closing unauthorized religious 
schools and stripping moslem imams or high priests who violate 
laws against proselytizing of their religious qualifications 
in its sunday broadcast the local xinjiang station said a 
very small number of reactionary elements in baren had declared 
the holy war seeking an independent republic the group was 
reported to have vowed to form moslem death squads and preached the 
triumph of islam over marxism leninism and socialism 
this gang under the banner of religion incited a religious 
craze and wildly proclaimed the launching of a sacred war to 
eliminate the heathens the television report said 
the report quoted an unnamed leader as saying even moslem 
women must kill the enemy 
it said ringleaders included fugitive murderers former labor 
camp inmates and habitual thieves who met together many times they 
recruited dozens of young people whom they trained to be hired 
thugs and amassed weapons and ammunition including long knives 
dynamite packs and grenades 
they allegedly forced illinformed masses to make trouble on 
april 5 and surrounded officials and security forces who tried to 
maintain order 
they frenziedly stopped and attacked the public security 
personnel who went to perform their duty robbed them of their 
weapons and killed six armed police officers and fighters injured 
13 others and destroyed four police vehicles it said 
the next day they opened fire and hurled bombs at police and 
officials wounding three more police officers police retaliated 
killing 15 rioters a provincial official was killed and three 
security officials hurt during the pursuit the report said 
following the unrest xinjiang closed the area to all foreign 
visitors officials in both urumqi and beijing have refused to 
comment on the reported clashes 
national news media have ignored the strife the communist 
partys official newspaper the peoples daily on sunday carried a 
lengthy frontpage article praising the central governments 
support for xinjiangs economic and cultural development 
it said the governments policies have strengthened unity among 
the regions various minorities

a woman blamed for a fourhour delay of a 
northwest airlines flight says she was just joking when she 
questioned the pilots sobriety 
i said when they told us that a pilot was on his way in to 
staff the plane i hope he hasnt been partying i didnt even 
say drunk ann beaver said saturday in a telephone interview 
from atlanta where she was visiting her children 
a flight attendant and the pilot whom northwest has refused to 
identify took the comment seriously and the pilot demanded a 
blood test which showed no alcohol in his system the airline 
said results of a urine test were expected today 
the pilot had been assigned to flight 497 from detroit to 
atlanta on thursday after the scheduled pilot was delayed en route 
from milwaukee 
beaver said she made her remark as the substitute pilot was 
driving to the detroit airport she said she told him she was only 
joking but he said you made an allegation and now i have to 
go to a hospital and take a blood test 
the flight was delayed while another substitute pilot was 
procured when the plane finally left beaver and her husband 
stayed behind because other passengers were mad at them northwest 
said the couple took a flight friday 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said beaver seriously questioned 
the pilots sobriety and integrity he said the pilot has an 
impeccable record in his more than 20 years with the airline 
beaver said she has been made a scapegoat im a certified 
social worker with a masters degree said beaver 50 im not 
a nut 
three northwest pilots were arrested on march 8 in minneapolis 
and accused of flying from fargo nd while drunk they were 
fired and face state and federal charges 
by the conduct of three former crew members we made ourselves 
a target for some jokes and were able to withstand it gibbons 
said but this was more than a joking remark in the estimation of 
the man who was going to fly the plane

after marching from the auschwitz death 
camp to the crematoria of birkenau the roughly 4000 teenagers 
from 36 countries marking holocaust memorial day lighted torches 
and heard a prayer for the dead 
in israel sirens wailed for two minutes sunday as life briefly 
came to a standstill in remembrance of the 6 million jews slain by 
the nazis 
writer elie wiesel diplomats and israeli parliamentarians 
joined the young marchers in southern poland for the twomile 
march of the living 
the sunny day turned cloudy and light rain started as wiesel 
stood at a podium before a gray stone monument to recall his time 
at auschwitz 
years and years ago i saw i cannot tell you what i saw im 
afraid that if i told you we would all wake up in tears and would 
not be able to stop i see a young girl he said before 
stopping apparently unable to continue he silently left the 
podium 
many cried as the students some carrying israeli flags and 
others bouquets of flowers walked along the train tracks that 
ended at the cremetoria 
dandelions waved in the windswept grass now covering the rubble 
of the camp torches were lighted poems read and mournful violin 
songs played before a reading of the kaddish a jewish prayer for 
the dead 
shawn tepper 17 of miami beach fla held hands with a row of 
other young american jews she said the experience was overwhelming 
but proved to everyone that we are alive we are together and we 
are strong 
the march was in memory of those who died in nazi death camps as 
well as in the warsaw ghetto uprising that began april 19 1943 
in the uprising several hundred jewish insurgents staged a 
desperate threeweek struggle against the nazi drive to liquidate 
the last 75000 residents of the walled ghetto 
sundays event was the second march of the living 
participants said it had special significance because of the drive 
toward german unification and israels rapid renewal of ties with 
eastern european countries that once had flourishing jewish 
communities 
the nazis built auschwitz as the main engine of hitlers final 
solution estimates of the death count vary but recent research 
has put the toll at the camp at about 15 million more than 90 
percent jews 
in israel as the sirens sounded at 10 am sunday traffic 
ground to a halt and thousands stood silently at attention to 
honor the victims 
hundreds of israelis also marked the day by participating in 
ceremonies across the country at which the names of victims were 
read by relatives and friends 
according to recent statistics 302404 holocaust survivors live 
in the nation of 47 million people including polishborn prime 
minister yitzhak shamir and other top military and political 
leaders 
i remember my family members who have died in those terrible 
and fearsome days said shamir 74 during a ceremony outside 
parliament he lost his parents two sisters their husbands and 
children during world war ii 
the holocaust still deeply influences private lives and politics 
in israel reflected in both the rightwing preoccupation with 
security and the liberal drive to guard human rights but its 
impact on the younger generation is diminishing

native lebanon left that country a weakened man who said he kept 
his sanity during 39 months of captivity by staying angry at his 
captors 
i was angry at what was done to me at being taken away from 
my wife and family my friends and students the 55yearold 
american educator said in a syrian television interview after his 
release sunday 
and so i strived to continue to be angry knowing at all times 
that if i began to lose that anger i would just sort of become a 
vegetable and i didnt want that to happen

his mother ruth polhill a retired high school librarian who 
lives in fishkill ny said in an interview before her sons

trips for a new york city accounting firm 
it was very beautiful she recalled he loved the people 
he loved the campus 
despite his anger while held 1182 days by the proiranian 
shiite moslem militants polhill said he tried not to think about 
when he would be released 
freedom is something that believe it or not neither me nor 
my two associates spent a lot of time thinking about he said in 
the syrian interview its a bit like you wish you had a tbone 
steak in front of you 
knowing you were not going to get it right away makes you more 
hungry makes you want that steak more so we didnt spend time 
thinking or talking about when wed be freed 
polhill said he was not mistreated and that his guards tried to 
provide amenities within the limitations placed on them but the 
uncertainties terrified him and his two fellow captives 
we were very much in the dark about our status he said 
we didnt know where we stood that was the worst we didnt know 
when or whether we were ever going to be released 
polhill a diabetic attended cornell university and graduated 
from new york university in 1961 
he later began work as a new york city accountant he was 
described as a photography buff an avid new york giants fan and a 
committed educator 
polhill had two children from a previous marriage 
his mother said he told her before his abduction that he was not 
fearful living on the beirut campus now thats what he tells his 
mother she said he had all the confidence hes be safe on the 
beirut campus 
said son brian we knew it kidnapping was a possibility but 
it wasnt something he put a big accent on he was extremely 
careful he kept a low profile 
syrian tv on sunday showed polhill being driven through beirut 
lebanon sitting in the back of a car and puffing heavily on a 
cigarette he appeared drawn after his long ordeal and smiled wanly 
several times 
he said his first day of captivity stood out mostly clearly in 
his mind 
i remember my first day in captivity more than the rest of my 
days in captivity it was boring he said 
he added we were not allowed to speak loudly we had 
something to read but we were deprived materials that gave any 
news about us

monday but the margins remain very limited one milan trader 
said 
he predicted the dollar would run into strong resistance around 
16970 west german marks before resuming its longerterm downward

an abortion rights group is jumping into 
the iowa governors race with an ad campaign that attacks an 
antiabortion democrat but also aims to persuade one of two 
prochoice candidates to drop out 
kate michelman of the national abortion rights action league 
concedes its a highrisk tactic but says her groups campaign 
dramatizes the importance of gubernatorial races since the supreme 
court expanded the power of states to regulate abortion 
no election is more important than iowas race for governor 
this year ms michelman said 
ms michelman said her group will launch a series of ads 
attacking attorney general tom miller a democrat contending 
voters wont have a choice if hes nominated to run against 
incumbent republican gov terry branstad both miller and branstad 
take antiabortion positions 
miller asked last weekend about the planned ad campaign called 
naral a singleissue group and added they represent all thats 
wrong with politics in america today 
the campaign ran into an immediate complication as seven of 
eight commercial television stations refused to carry the ads that 
left the group with cable television and radio stations but it 
vowed to move ahead 
ms michelman said the drive could wind up persuading one of the 
two prochoice candidates to drop from the race to avoid splitting 
the vote 
our going in at this moment may also contribute to one of the 
prochoice candidates emerging as the leading candidate she said 
democratic contenders house speaker don avenson and retired 
banker john chrystal both favor abortion rights and ms michelman 
said both are good people 
this is tough its very hard to say you hope one will get 
out she said if it makes sense and we believe strategically 
it would ensure that branstad has a prochoice challenger we may 
end up endorsing the candidate we believe has the best chance 
of winning 
that announcement probably wouldnt come until a few weeks 
before the june 5 primary she said 
avenson has been endorsed by virtually all labor unions in the 
state and by some womens groups he is generally considered the 
leading prochoice contender he has held discussions with ms 
michelman about a possible endorsement 
the campaign underscores the focus being placed on iowa by both 
prochoice and antiabortion activists the state is the home of 
the first presidential caucuses every four years 
abortion also is a major issue in iowas us senate race in 
which incumbent democrat tom harkin favors abortion rights and gop 
challenger tom tauke is antiabortion 
following last years supreme court decision the main abortion 
battleground is in the states ms michelman said 
governors are now the most important elected officials in the 
nation she said 
the ads provide an escalation in a democratic primary thats 
already heated miller the ads declare wants to let the 
government interfere in your most personal decision 
the fact is that tom miller is the only antichoice candidate 
in the democratic primary and its very important for democratic 
voters to understand that ms michelman said 
picking between two candidates who support abortion rights is 
more difficult she conceded 
this is a very unusual step she said we generally do not 
endorse in a contest where there are two prochoice candidates

an accident at a chemical factory sent a 
cloud of hydrochloric acid fumes drifting over two trailer parks 
forcing evacuation of about 1000 people for four hours

the residents were evacuated about 1130 pm sunday and were 
allowed to return home about 330 am today said dion lemieux 
fire chief for muskegon countys egelston township

a violent chemical reaction and released a cloud of the highly 
toxic acid fumes lemieux said 
two firefighters were treated for exposure to the fumes at mercy 
hospital in muskegon and released he said he said an unknown 
number of residents also sought treatment mercy hospital wasnt 
immediately able to provide information on those it treated a 
switchboard operator said 
the acid cloud forced evacuation of a sixsquaremile area of 
egelston and muskegon townships lemieux said he said he had no 
idea how many people were forced to flee he said many took 
temporary shelter at oak ridge high school 
the federal environmental protection agency and state department 
of natural resources have joined the investigation of the spill he 
said 
most of those forced to flee lived in two mobile home parks 
arlington estates and eaglecraft park authorities said together 
the two parks have about 1000 residents said gordon christian 
manager of arlington estates 
you could see the brown in the air christian said 
during the evacuation he said residents were real calm they 
were orderly im proud of them everybody looked out for everybody 
else they do look out for their neighbors

friends and family of british hostages in lebanon 
today welcomed the release of american robert polhill as a step 
toward freeing all the captives and urged the government to talk 
to those who influence the kidnappers 
we seem to be in a period now where people are being released 
rather than taken and of course that is grounds i would say for 
great optimism said david waite 
his brother terry waite the archbishop of canterburys envoy 
disappeared in beirut in january 1987 while trying to negotiate the 
release of american hostages 
a spokesman for anglican archbishop robert runcie welcomed 
polhills release and said if it is a step towards closing the 
hostage file that is even better news 
the friends of john mccarthy a british journalist kidnapped in 
april 1986 warned that if britain does not begin discussions with 
iran and syria it might be the only country unable to bring its 
hostages home 
the group said in a statement the american government will 
have achieved this hostage release through diplomacy and 
negotiations with the iranian and syrian governments a process the 
friends of john mccarthy have been appealing to the british 
government to undertake on behalf of the british hostages for some 
years now 
the us government says it made no deals with polhills 
kidnappers after polhill was released sunday however president 
bush thanked syria and iran for their roles in influencing the 
kidnappers 
britain broke diplomatic ties with syria in 1986 accusing it of 
complicity in the attempted bombing of an el al jetliner at 
londons heathrow airport relations with iran were severed in 
february 1989 following the publication of the satanic verses 
the novel by salman rushdie that has angered many moslems 
conservative lawmaker robert adley chairman of the 
britishsyrian parliamentary group called on his partys 
government to restore diplomatic relations with syria immediately 
the foreign office said it has been in close contact with 
american officials in recent weeks 
they have assured us they are pressing for the release of all 
western hostages said a spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity in keeping with british custom 
britain also seeks the release of retired pilot jack mann and 
schoolteacher brian keenan who also holds irish citizenship 
the foreign office says it seeks word on alec collett a new 
yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him but his body was never found

west germany gave in to a key east 
german demand today and said it would convert east german wages to 
an equal number of west german marks 
the east german mark is officially valued at 31 against the 
west mark but unofficially worth almost nothing outside east 
germany 
both nations have said they expect a full merger of the 
economies of the nations to be in place on july 1 
east german salaries will be valued at a straight 11 rate to 
the powerful west mark said dieter vogel spokesman for west 
german chancellor helmut kohl 
vogels announcement cleared a major hurdle to an agreement 
between the germanys on eventual unification 
the east german government of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
wanted a straight 11 exchange for wages pensions and bank 
accounts to offset the effects of eliminating the heavy subsidies 
of the former socialist system

an influential congressman says the united 
states should make a goodwill gesture in response to the release of 
an american hostage but an administration official said today 
president bush is not into gestures 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on the middle east said the release of hostage robert 
polhill on sunday made it appropriate for the united states to 
send some kind of a gesture that were willing to enter into a 
dialogue with iran 
john kelly assistant secretary of state for near eastern and 
south asian affairs said today the policy is very clear we 
dont make deals the president has said as he did on inauguration 
day that good will begets good will but as he noted yesterday he 
wants all the hostages out 
interviewed on nbcs today show kelly noted that president 
bush has said hes not into gestures nevertheless kelly 
added were always looking at how we can improve the situation 
and attempting to figure out ways that will speed the release 
without compromising our principles 
hamilton and others spoke after polhill was freed in lebanon 
after spending almost 39 months as a hostage their comments came 
before bush reacted publicly to the release by reaffirming his 
absolute policy against trading for hostages but expressing 
willingness to give credit where credit is due for polhills 
release 
its establishing a dialogue that is critical hamilton said 
there are a lot of things that could be done here short of 
aid short of normalization short of credits that might be a 
gesture in response to the release of a hostage he said on 
cbstvs face the nation 
in an initial written statement bush thanked iran and syria for 
their roles in polhills release but subsequently told reporters 
he wasnt sure how much iran had to do with it and said he was 
purposely stopping a little short in his expressions toward 
iran 
i dont want to give credit when i dont know the facts he 
said 
while insisting that he had no intention of trading for hostages 
or dealing with kidnappers and declaring that he was not trying 
to think up any gesture toward iran or anyone else bush did say 
id have goodwill to those who facilitated the release if that 
included iran absolutely 
but he emphasized that he does not have forgiveness in my 
heart as long as one american is held against his will 
in an editorial in todays editions the tehran times newspaper 
said another hostage should be freed to test president bushs 
claim that goodwill begets goodwill 
this they should do swiftly in order to leave the ball in the 
other partys court to demonstrate its goodwill if it has any 
said the englishlanguage newspaper which often reflects the views 
of iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
irans foreign minister meanwhile was quoted as saying the 
proiranian extremists in lebanon wanted a quick reciprocal move 
the official syrian arab news agency quoting ali akbar velayati in 
new york specified that move would be the release of sheik abdul 
karim obeid a lebanese shiite clergyman abducted by israeli 
soldiers in july 
kamal kharazzi irans ambassador to the united nations said 
today on abcs good morning america that iran will continue 
trying our best to facilitate the release of hostages we are 
actually involved in encouraging lebanese militant moslems to free 
hostages he said 
asked if there would be another release soon he said we hope 
so 
but he said bushs policy of no reciprocity unless all the 
hostages are released would put some more complexity to the 
situation these sort of statements may present problems 
richard murphy a former assistant secretary of state for the 
near east in the reagan administration said today on nbc that i 
dont think they the iranians have any reason to expect a 
positive gesture hostagebyhostage and thats what the president 
in effect is telling us in his statements he wants them all out 
the seven americans and other western hostages are believed to 
be held by different groups of shiite moslems in lebanon under 
differing degrees of influence from iran 
gary sick a columbia university professor who dealt with 
iranian matters during the carter administration said western 
nations probably must make concessions to get their hostages out of 
lebanon 
this is not going to be easy he said if the west wants 
to get their hostages out theyre going to have to provide some 
concessions to iran and others along the way he said on meet 
the press 
our policy for a long time has been that we will talk directly 
with the government of iran but there can be no normalization of 
our relations with the iranian government until they reject the 
notion of terrorism and until they do everything they can to obtain 
the release of our hostages secretary of state james a baker 
iii said at a news conference 
our policy is that we do not negotiate with hostageholders 
and we dont make deals for hostages baker said and the 
reason we dont is because we think that will simply lead to more 
and more hostagetaking 
since the end of the devastating iraniraq war last year 
rafsanjani has made overtures toward western nations in an attempt 
to rebuild his countrys shattered economy

a day after the government admitted financing a 
jewish settlement in the old citys christian quarter church 
leaders said they will close the major christian sites for a day 
and ring bells in protest 
the protest friday will mark the first time all christian holy 
places in jerusalem bethlehem and nazareth will close samir 
kafiti anglican bishop in jerusalem said today 
on sunday the israeli government acknowledged it had put up 
18 million for the settlement of 150 jews in a complex not far 
from the church of the holy sepulchre the colony which was set up 
on april 11 has provoked angry demonstrations by christian clerics 
and palestinians both christian and moslem 
it also has brought legal moves by the greek orthodox church 
which owns the building and wants the jews evicted 
the governments acknowledgment sunday was the first 
confirmation of official involvement in buying arab property in 
jerusalems walled old city captured by israel during the 1967 
middle east war 
the settlement called neot david is the only jewish presence 
in the old citys christian sector its spokesmen have consistently 
said no government money was involved in the settlement 
the christian leaders who met early today to consolidate their 
response to the settlement said israeli government involvement in 
the matter endangers the survival of all christian communities in 
the holy city 
among the church properties to be closed are the church of the 
holy sepulchre the church of the nativity in bethlehem and the 
church of the annunciation in nazareth 
avi pazner a spokesman for caretaker prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said the churches planned protest was too hasty since the 
issue of the jewish settlement is before israeli courts 
i think with the reputation of israeli justice it would be 
worthwhile for those organizations to wait until there is a court 
decision pazner said i hope they will reconsider this 
decision 
the government money for the settlement passed from the housing 
ministry to a subsidiary trusteeship of the jewish national fund 
the ministry said in a statement the fund part of a 
quasigovernmental jewish agency was created in 1901 to buy land 
for the founding of israel 
the funds then went to a panamanian company sbc which invested 
an additional sum to buy legal rights to the four buildings it 
then rented the space to a religious jewish group which created 
the settlement 
this governmentbacked settlers action continues to provoke 
almost daily violent incidents in and around the area containing 
the holy sepulcher and the centers of church governance read a 
statement signed by ten christian church leaders 
signatories included the greek orthodox patriarch diodorus i 
the latin patriarch of jerusalem michel sabbah and leaders of 
other churches 
they said freedom of access to the holy sepulcher and freedom 
of worship within it have been threatened and the settlement 
seriously jeopardizes the integrity cultural and religious 
autonomy of the christian armenian and moslem quarters in 
violation of the centuriesold status 
the christian leaders demanded immediate eviction of the 
settlers and return of the property to the greek orthodox church 
the church claims that a former tenant sold his rights illegally 
israels supreme court is expected to continue its hearing of 
the eviction dispute thursday the court stayed an eviction order 
during the proceedings 
a separate case on the property dispute is before a lower court 
and attorneys for the church say a ruling in not expected before 
six months 
the church closure will be in effect between 9 am friday and 
an unspecified hour the following day and church bells will play a 
funeral toll on the hour from 9 am until noon friday 
however both diodorus i and kafiti who addressed reporters to 
announce the protest measures say the closure may remain in effect 
longer than announced

officials today welcomed the release of a us 
hostage by proiranian shiite kidnappers but gave no indication 
israel is ready to free arab prisoners to encourage further 
releases 
robert polhill 55 a business professor was freed sunday after 
1182 days of captivity 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati called immediately 
for a swift reciprocal move the freeing of shiite moslem cleric 
sheik abdul karim obeid who was abducted by israeli troops in 
lebanon last july 
avi pazner spokesman for caretaker prime minister yitzhak 
shamir gave no indication that israel planned to free obeid or 
urge the freeing of about 300 shiites and palestinians held in the 
khiam prison by the israelibacked south lebanon army militia 
we are very pleased to hear about the release of this 
american hostage and would like to see the day when all hostages 
americans others and especially israelis are also released we 
pray that that day will come soon pazner said in an interview 
he acknowledged that on the hostage issue as a whole of 
course we are talking with the united states as we do on every 
issue 
but pazner stressed there was no coordination on the release 
of this hostage between israel and the us government or any 
other party 
israel has offered to trade obeid for all foreign hostages 
along with an israeli an air force navigator and two soldiers who 
were captured by shiite guerrillas in lebanon in 1986 
the south lebanon army said it had no intention of freeing 
shiite prisoners in response to polhills release according to 
israel radio 
however it could still make such a gesture thursday or friday 
in connection with the id al fitr the moslem holiday marking the 
end of the monthlong ramadan fast prisoner releases are 
traditional during the holiday 
an israeli army spokesman declined to say if israel would 
release any of the nearly 9000 palestinians jailed in connection 
with the 28month palestinian uprising 
the tehran times which is close to iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani called in an editorial for goodwill gestures to 
expedite further releases 
but it said that as long as israel holds scores of arab 
prisoners the hostage holders will certainly find it hard to 
comply with this request and their position is quite 
understandable 
in the days before polhills release israel carried out two 
attacks in lebanon that were seen by some observers as increased 
pressure on proiranian groups holding hostages 
on friday israeli troops struck beyond israels selfproclaimed 
security zone in south lebanon killing six guerrillas of the 
hezbollah the proiranian shiite moslem militia that is believed 
linked with groups holding western hostages 
the day before israeli airplanes bombed two bases in lebanon 
belonging to ahmed jibrils popular front for the liberation of

discoverys astronauts are back for 
a second try at a spaceshot and theyre optimistic the shuttle 
will lift off with the hubble space telescope on tuesday despite 
one crewmans bad luck with launches 
meanwhile columbia was rolled out sunday to the launch pad 16 
miles from discovery only the second time both pads at kennedy 
space center have been occupied the first time was just before the 
challenger explosion in 1986 
discovery is due to lift off at 831 am tuesday forecasters 
today said they expect an 80 percent chance of favorable weather 
up from the 70 percent predicted sunday nasa expects to launch 
columbia no earlier than may 16 one week late because of 
discoverys twoweek delay 
today i bring you only good news nasa test director al 
sofge said today the launch vehicle is in good shape the hubble 
space telescope is in good shape the flight crew is ready and 
the weather looks good so at this point everything is go 
discovery commander loren j shriver and his four crew members 
returned to cape canaveral on sunday shriver poked fun at steven 
a hawleys unwanted distinction of having the most shuttle launch 
scrubs or postponements 
hawley experienced three postponements on his first flight in 
1984 and six on his second in 1986 a mission he shared with 
discoverys pilot charles f bolden jr he felt so jinxed he 
donned a groucho marx mask to disguise himself while waiting aboard 
columbia on its seventh and successful launch attempt 
discoverys first launch attempt halted four minutes before 
liftoff april 10 because of a faulty power unit was hawleys 10th 
mission scrub 
we feel very confident despite the fact that we did not make 
steve wear any kind of disguise or do any kind of masquerade yet 
he and charlie both shriver joked 
nasa test director mike leinbach said the countdown which began 
saturday was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in 
perfect condition the malfunctioning power unit was replaced a 
week ago 
the 15 billion telescope nasas most expensive and complex 
payload will enable astronomers to look back to nearly the 
beginning of time and solve some of the universes mysteries 
discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles the highest a 
shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper 
orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere hawley will use the 
shuttles mechanical arm to lift the 24250pound telescope into 
space on the second day of the fiveday mission 
a 100 million observatory called astro will accompany 
columbias seven astronauts into space next month and probe 
ultraviolet radiation 
columbia commander vance brand said he does not believe nasa is 
rushing to get his shuttle up 
in some cases it could be a problem having shuttles on both 
launch pads he said in this particular case everythings 
fitting together

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
the california murder conviction a black panther party member who 
was shackled during his 17month trial 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
shackling at johnny spains trial violated his rights 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said spain is entitled to 
a new trial or to go free because he was forced to wear 25 pounds 
of chain more than 10 hours a day while on trial for allegedly 
murdering two san quentin prison guards 
in a 21 ruling last august the appeals court said the shackles 
prejudiced the jury against spain by making him appear guilty the 
appeals court said the shackles caused him so much physical and 
emotional pain it was difficult for him to assist in his own 
defense 
if extraordinary steps were needed for courtroom security it 
would have been preferable to bar spain from the trial or permit 
him to miss some days to rest and regain his strength the appeals 
court said 
spain had said that to avoid chaining he was willing to give up 
his right to be present at the trial 
california prosecutors urged the justices to reinstate spains 
conviction and life prison sentence 
spain 41 was convicted in 1976 of murdering two guards in a 
widely publicized case 
he was freed on 350000 bail in march 1988 while the state 
appealed to the 9th circuit court to reverse a federal judges 
ruling that overturned spains conviction 
since his release spain has worked as an electrician and taught 
a course entitled society behind bars at the university of 
california at berkeley 
spain has spent 21 years in prison beginning in 1967 for a 
murder committed in 1966 when he was 17 
in the case acted on today spain was among six inmates dubbed 
the san quentin six after they were charged with taking part in 
a bloody escape attempt aug 21 1971 three guards and three 
inmates were killed in the incident 
one inmate who died was george jackson a black revolutionary 
writer and author of the book soledad brother 
he was shot down attempting to flee san quentin after taking 
over the solitary confinement unit with a gun he produced following 
a visit with one of his attorneys the lawyer stephen m bingham 
was later acquitted of murder and conspiracy 
during their trial in a san rafael calif courtroom all six 
defendants were chained around the legs wrists and waist and 
other extraorindary security measures were taken 
the measures were prompted in part by the killing of a judge at 
the same courthouse in 1970 when george jacksons brother 
jonathan took over a courtroom and attempted to exchange the 
judge a prosecutor and a juror for his brother and other inmates 
the case is rushen vs spain 891336

the supreme court today rejected a chemical 
companys challenge to federal standards for clean water 
the court without comment left intact rules that govern more 
than 1000 factories producing organic chemicals plastics and 
synthetic fibers 
the environmental protection agency adopted the guidelines in 
1987 to limit pollutants dumped into the nations waterways 
the limits were challenged by ppg industries inc of pittsburgh 
which said the guidelines are too stringent and that some 
violations are unavoidable 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals rejected the companys 
arguments last year 
ppg said the appeals court unjustifiably concluded that as 
long as a hypothetical best plant theoretically could achieve 
the full set of limitations then it is irrelevant that no actual 
plant can do so 
the bush administration urged the justices to reject ppgs 
appeal saying the claims are unsupported by technical evidence 
the natural resources defense council an environmental group 
that has said the epa regulations should be tougher denounced 
ppgs appeal 
ppg has had more than its fair day in court and this 
persistent frontal assault on epas rules should be stopped in its 
tracks the environmental groups lawyers said 
the case is ppg industries vs environmental protection agency

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a former member of the church of scientology of california who 
wanted the church declared a phony religion 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by larry 
wollersheim of aspen colo 
still pending before the justices is an appeal by the church of 
scientology of california aimed at overturning a 25 million 
emotional distress award won by wollersheim 
a california appeals court ruled that the church must pay 
wollersheim 500000 in compensatory damages and 2 million in 
punitive damages 
a trial jury had awarded wollersheim 30 million in damages but 
that amount was reduced by the appeals court 
scientology was founded by l ron hubbard who died in 1986 
scientologists believe they can progress toward spiritual 
awareness through private sessions in which members skin responses 
to questions are monitored by an electronic device called an 
emeter which hubbard invented 
the church calls such monitoring sessions auditing 
wollersheim a scientologist from 1969 to 1979 said church 
members harassed him and tried to drive his novelty business into 
bankruptcy scientology officials denied the charges but a jury in 
los angeles ruled for wollersheim 
upholding the jurys finding that church officials inflicted 
emotional distress on wollersheim the state appeals court last 
august said there was substantial evidence to support a factual 
finding that the auditing as well as other practices in this case 
were conducted in a coercive environment 
the state court therefore ruled that the churchs asserted 
religious freedom could not shield it from having to pay the 
damages award 
lawyers for the church are arguing in its appeal that the 
constitution prohibits courts from imposing emotional distress 
tort liability based upon peaceful religious practices by 
permitting juries to determine that such practices constitute 
coercive persuasion 
the stillpending appeal also raises a dueprocess challenge to 
the 2 million punitive damages award an issue the justices 
already have under study in another case 
in wollersheims appeal rejected today he accused scientology 
of being a mockery of religion and a religious front but 
the appeal did not appear to ask the court for any remedy except a 
formal declaration that scientology is not really religion 
in response lawyers for the church told the justices 
wollersheims appeal sought an advisory opinion that could have 
no possible effect on the outcome of this case in its present 
posture 
the case is wollersheim vs church of scientology of california

they captured staterun radio nigeria offices and announced that 
the government had been overthrown but babangidas forces later 
retook the station after what state media described as heavy 
bombardment and sporadic shooting 
there was no word on how many people were killed in the 
fighting but reporters said casualties appeared heavy 
the fighting began at 2 am sunday with an attack on dodan 
barracks the military headquarters where babangida has his 
residence 
the president escaped moments before his residence was shelled 
according to government sources 
babangida then fled to bonny camp to direct a counterattack by 
loyal forces the coup attempt failed as senior commanders in other 
regions of the country went on the radio to declare their support 
for babangida 
witnesses also reported heavy fighting around state house 
gunfire was reported at several other military installations in the 
city of 6 million on the atlantic ocean 
babangida said his aide lt col u k bello was killed in the 
gunbattle at the military headquarters the official news agency of 
nigeria reported 
the unfortunate situation in lagos this morning has been 
brought under control babangida told reporters sunday night 
there were no reports of fighting elsewhere in nigeria 
babangida said many rebel soldiers had been arrested and would 
soon face trial but he did not give any specific figure among 
those arrested he said were majors lieutenants and second 
lieutenants in the military 
the rebellion apparently was led by officers opposed to 
traditional domination by moslem northerners over the central and 
southern states which are mainly christian and animist 
when the rebels took over the radio station they broadcast an 
announcement accusing the states of borno bauchi kano katsina 
and sokoto in the moslemdominated north of messing up the rest 
of the country 
a rebel officer said those states would not be allowed to be 
part of nigeria until they fulfilled conditions proving loyalty to 
a new government 
a similar conflict along religious and tribal lines caused the 
19671969 biafran war more than 500000 civilians and 100000 
soldiers died when easterners attempted to form the state of biafra 
and secede from nigeria 
moslems are a slight majority in the oilrich nation of 100 
million people africas most populous the country gained 
independence from britain in 1960 
the rebellious soldiers on sunday tried to stir up popular 
support with radio broadcasts they told nigerians this is the 
opportunity to free yourselves from internal slavery 
the official news agency said other parts of the country were 
calm however in ibadan a southern university city thousands of 
students took to the streets in support of the coup plotters 
eleven hours after the fighting began lt gen sani abacha 
army chief and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff went on 
national radio to say the coup had been smashed he also urged 
remaining rebels to surrender 
the news agency of nigeria quoted col ishaya bamaiyi as saying 
earlier announcements by rebel troops who seized the lagos radio 
station represented the view of a few disgruntled officers 
babangidas military government has been viewed as weighted in 
favor of the moslem north since the dismissal in december of lt 
gen domkat bali a christian as defense minister 
in one rebel radio broadcast a man identifying himself as maj 
gideon ngwozor oka announced 
fellow nigerian citizens on behalf of the patriotic and 
wellmeaning peoples of the middle belt and southern parts of this 
country i wish to happily inform you of the successful ousting 
of the dictatorial corrupt drugbaronish inhumane sadistic 
deceitful homosexually centered and unpatriotic administration of 
general ibrahim babangida 
babangida took power aug 27 1987 when he overthrew gen 
muhammadu buhari in a bloodless barracks coup nigeria has been 
led by military governments for much of its history 
the general has promised elections and a return to civilian 
government in 1992

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating a hawaii womans assault conviction thrown out because 
a federal magistrate not a federal judge presided over jury 
selection in her trial 
the justices said they will review a ruling that overturned 
darlina frances conviction and fiveyear prison sentence for 
shooting her husband 
mrs france was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon 
assault with intent to murder and related charges she was 
sentenced to five years in prison plus three years probation 
the case was tried in federal court because mrs france and her 
husband neil were living on an army base in hawaii when the 
shooting occurred dec 20 1986 
prosecutors said mrs france shot her husband in the shoulder 
after he took her beer from the refrigerator and put it in the 
backyard they said the couple had argued earlier in the day and 
that she became upset when he knocked over a christmas tree 
mrs france said her husband provoked the shooting by attacking 
her france testified that he believed the gun went off 
accidentally urged that his wife not be prosecuted and said they 
were reconciling 
in overturning mrs frances conviction last september the 9th 
us circuit court relied upon a supreme court ruling the previous 
june 
in it the high court said federal judges to ensure an 
impartial trial may not delegate the task of presiding over jury 
selection to magistrates federal judges unlike magistrates are 
appointed for life to assure they will not be swayed improperly by 
popular opinion 
in the case decided last june the defendants had objected to 
having a magistrate preside over jury selection 
mrs france made no such objection prior to her trial but the 
9th circuit court said the distinction has little significance 
the appeals court said she should not be penalized for failing 
to object to what at the time of her trial was the generally 
accepted rule that magistrates could select juries 
the appeals court in an unusual move also said federal 
prosecutors were too harsh in charging mrs france under a 1984 
federal law that carries a mandatory fiveyear prison term for 
offenders 
we have been left with the sense that darlina france may 
not be the sort of hardened violent offender whom congress had in 
mind when it enacted the 1984 law the appeals court said 
justice department lawyers in the appeal acted on today said 
mrs france forfeited her right to have jury selection conducted by 
a federal judge because she failed to object to the magistrates 
role before trial 
dozens of convictions could be thrown out if the 9th circuit 
court ruling is not reversed the government lawyers said the 9th 
circuit court has jurisdiction in hawaii alaska arizona 
california nevada oregon idaho montana and washington state 
the case is us vs france 891363

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
virginia officials seeking more power to prevent fraud by 
businesses that solicit charitable donations 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that lets federal 
judges block some antifraud measures for violating freespeech 
rights 
the dispute stems from an investigation by virginia consumer 
protection officials into the conduct of telco communications 
which raises funds for police organizations and firefighter unions 
the state office of consumer affairs said it received complaints 
that telco was misleading potential donors for example the state 
said one solicitor allegedly lied and claimed he was a volunteer 
state officials met with telco officials in 1988 without 
reaching any resolution about two weeks later the company sued in 
federal court to block the state from taking any action 
the state said the federal judge should not interfere 
particularly since the states investigation was incomplete but 
the judge ruled against the consumer protection office 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last september upheld much 
of the judges ruling 
the appeals court said federal judges may bar state enforcement 
in such cases where state proceedings were in a preliminary stage 
and where the state had imposed a prior restraint upon protected 
speech otherwise the appeals court said it would leave a 
partys constitutional rights in limbo while an agency contemplates 
enforcement but does not undertake it 
the appeals court said there no longer is a live controversy 
over one of the states antifraud laws that required professional 
solicitors to tell potential donors how much of their contributions 
will go to the charities 
a supreme court ruling in 1988 prohibits such laws the appeals 
court said 
the appeals court also struck down a virginia regulation that 
solicitors must submit to the state in advance a written script 
of what it tells potential donors that kind of review by the state 
amounts to an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech the 
appeals court said 
but the 4th circuit court upheld a virginia regulation requiring 
solicitors to tell potential donors in writing that the 
fundraisers financial statements are available from the state 
consumer affairs office 
the appeals court refused to decide whether the state may 
suspend or revoke a fundraisers right to do business for 
violating the antifraud rules it would be premature to decide 
that issue since telco was not accused of violating any 
regulations the appeals court said 
the case is carbaugh vs telco communications 891311

a fraillooking robert polhill 
the first american released by proiranian lebanese captors in 
nearly 3 years walked slowly off a plane today after winning 
freedom with the aid of syria and iran 
doctors who later examined the 55yearold educator said he was 
malnourished and mildly dehydrated 
polhills release sunday after 1182 days of captivity was 
followed by a reported call by irans foreign minister for a swift 
reciprocal move freedom for a shiite moslem cleric kidnapped by 
israeli troops in july 
president bush thanked iran and syria whose military forces in 
lebanon picked up polhill in west beirut and drove him to the 
syrian capital of damascus for their help in securing the release 
but the president said he would make no deals with the 
proiranian shiite moslem militants in lebanon still holding 17 
western hostages seven of them americans 
an iranian newspaper close to that countrys president hashemi 
rafsanjani today called on the lebanese kidnappers to release 
another american hostage immediately and without conditions 
rafsanjani is among iranian leaders seeking better relations 
with the west the bush administration has expressed willingness to 
improve ties if the hostage crisis is settled 
and in beirut hussein musawi a leading proiranian shiite 
cleric said today that freeing another western hostage was in 
the cards but he stressed there must first be reciprocity on the 
part of washington 
musawi interviewed by the communistrun voice of the people 
said the possibility of another release is in the cards but i 
dont know when how or for what 
such a step polhills release has to have a reciprocation 
it is not feasible that all releases would be made as goodwill 
gestures he said 
he refused to speculate on which hostage might be freed next 
us officials said today in wiesbaden that they had no 
information about another us hostage being released they said 
they were not aware of any message for bush polhill may have 
brought from his captors 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said polhill 
was kept in the same building as american hostages jesse turner and 
alann steen but he probably doesnt know about terry anderson or 
terry waite 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press was kidnapped on march 16 1985 he has been held the 
longest of the foreign hostages waite 50 british envoy of the 
anglican church disappeared in lebanon on jan 20 1987 
polhill a new yorker looked extremely frail today and was 
hunched over as he came down the steps of the us air force c141 
at rheinmain air base in a cold rain supported by two airmen 
he was dressed in a military camouflage jacket and carried a 
football given to him as a touch of america under one arm 
during the short walk to a military van 
about two dozen people nearby applauded and the gaunt polhill 
responded with a wave a helicopter whisked the freed hostage and 
his lebanese wife feryal to a us military hospital in nearby 
wiesbaden 
welcome home pray for the others read one banner hung 
outside the hospital where polhill began medical tests and was to 
be debriefed by us intelligence agents 
military spokesman cmdr john woodhouse said polhills stay at 
the hospital which has received other freed us hostages could 
be anywhere from a couple of days to a few weeks 
he is alert stable ambulatory and somewhat tired said a 
medical bulletin based on polhills first two hours in the 
hospital although he appears to be in relatively good shape he 
is malnourished and mildly dehydrated 
it said doctors would also make an evaluation of polhills 
diabetes which he has had for 25 years 
polhill arrived at the hospital saying he was hungry and 
quickly downed a breakfast of grapefruit scrambled eggs bacon 
english muffins milk and coffee 
the exhostage later had a relaxed conversation with medical 
staff according to the statement 
about 100 people cheered and clapped as polhill arrived in 
wiesbaden 
in damascus the business professor said his unrelenting anger 
at his captors had kept him alive and sane during the ordeal he 
also said that his joy at being free was tempered by the knowledge 
that others were still held 
i was angry at what was being done to me being taken away 
from my wife and family he told a syrian tv reporter as he was 
being driven from beirut to damascus and so i strived to 
continue being angry knowing at all times that if i began to lose 
that anger id just sort of become a vegetable 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati said in new york 
after the release that iran and the shiite factions in lebanon want 
the israelis to release sheik abdul karim obeid in return the 
official syrian arab news agency reported obeid was kidnapped in 
south lebanon 
the tehran times which is close to rafsanjani said in an 
editorial today that as long as israel still holds scores of arab 
prisoners the captors will certainly find it hard to comply 
with the request for more releases 
but perhaps the release of one hostage alone will not be 
enough to establish the kind of overwhelming trust needed to bring 
the whole hostage crisis to an end it said 
though pale and apparently fatigued polhill managed to joke 
with reporters shortly after being turned over to us ambassador 
edward djerejian in syria 
the first thing id like to say is that im sorry i kept you 
waiting so long he told a news conference at the syrian foreign 
ministry 
polhill was abducted along with two other professors from beirut 
university college on jan 24 1987 by the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine the group still holds the other two jesse 
turner 42 of boise idaho and alann steen a 51yearold boston 
native 
the last american hostage to be freed was david jacobsen former 
director of the american university hospital in beirut he was 
kidnapped in beirut on may 28 1985 and released nov 2 1986 he 
had been held by another shiite faction islamic jihad or holy war

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether prison inmates who testify in federal court proceedings 
should be paid witness fees 
the court said it will hear an appeal by a colorado state prison 
inmate seeking compensation for testifying at a 1988 federal trial 
the inmate richard s demarest testified for the defendant on 
march 15 1988 he said he should be entitled to the same fee as 
anyone else who is a witness in federal court 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled last september that 
federal law does not require that prisoners be paid for appearing 
at federal trials 
beyond their loss of the very modest compensation they might 
receive from participating in prison jobs programs prisoners 
generally do not incur financial costs serving as witnesses the 
appeals court said 
the appeals courted noted that the 30aday witness fee is much 
more that inmates make working in prison industries 
demarest for example is paid 40 a month in his job at the 
arkansas valley correctional facility in crowley colorado 
the appeals court said paying prisoners could lead to abuses 
since it would tempt inmates who number in the millions to file 
suits and then subpoena inmate friends to testify 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject 
demarests appeal 
the case is demarest vs manspeaker 895916

the supreme court today agreed to hear the 
appeal of georgia death row inmate james a ford convicted of 
kidnapping and killing a newnan gas station manager in 1984 
the court said it will decide whether ford is entitled to a new 
trial because prosecutors used socalled peremptory challenges 
to exclude blacks from the jury 
the justices in 1986 barred prosecutors from disqualifying 
potential jurors based on their race and in 1987 they said that 
the 1986 ruling was to be applied retroactively to perhaps hundreds 
of other convicted defendants 
but georgia courts refused to apply the supreme court decisions 
in fords case 
today the justices said they will judge the validity of the 
georgia courts refusal 
ford was convicted of killing sarah dean after taking her from a 
gas station on march 1 1984 
ms deans ody was found locked in the trunk of her car which 
was submerged in a pond police said she had drowned

government warplanes dropped cluster bombs 
in two raids on the guerrillaheld red sea port of massawa killing 
50 civilians and wounding 110 ethiopian rebels said today 
the eritrean peoples liberation front said it expected the 
death toll to rise from sundays attacks as most of the wounded 
were in very bad condition according to a clandestine radio 
report monitored in the kenyan capital of nairobi 
about 50 houses were destroyed in the midmorning and early 
evening raids the radio said 
the rebeloperated voice of the broad masses of eritrea gave no 
further details of the air strikes the latest since secessionist 
guerrillas captured massawa from government forces in february 
the report on the air raids could not be independently verified 
massawa is one of two strategic harbors that traditionally 
handle most of ethiopias trade and relief supplies for millions of 
people threatened with starvation in the face of war drought and 
poor harvests 
the eritrean front has been fighting for control of ethiopias 
northernmost province since 1961 a year after the former italian 
colony lost political autonomy and was forcibly annexed by the late 
emperor haile selassie as a province 
rebels hold other towns and villages in eritrea and with 
backing from other guerrilla armies are seeking to overthrow 
marxist president mengistu haile mariam 
the rebel radio has reported several previous raids by warplanes 
dropping cluster bombs and napalm on civilians they have been 
denied by the addis ababa government 
israel has been accused of supplying the cluster bombs which 
contain dozens of smaller grenadelike bomblets that hurl shrapnel 
over wide areas 
both israel and ethiopia have denied these claims

chinese premier li peng arrived today for the 
first visit in 26 years by a chinese head of government to the 
soviet union chinas longtime rival for leadership of the 
communist world 
the fourday trip is to promote normal relations and ease border 
tensions at a time when both countries are confronted with serious 
domestic problems 
the 61yearold premier was expected to hold at least two rounds 
of talks with president mikhail s gorbachev who last may went to 
china in the first visit by a soviet leader in three decades 
lis visit to the ussr underscores the importance of 
continuing the sinosoviet dialogue at the summit level which 
began a year ago and signalled the normalization of relations 
the tass news agency said 
li was met at the airport by premier nikolai ryzhkov and foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
i will be exchanging views with president gorbachev chairman 
ryzhkov and other comrades from the soviet leadership on matters 
concerning bilateral relations and on major international issues of 
common concern li said at the airport 
tass said ryzhkov and peng began meeting monday but did not 
report what they were discussing 
gorbachevs historic visit to china was overshadowed by 
studentled prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing which ended 
weeks later when li and other chinese leaders sent in troops to 
crush the movement 
in moscow gorbachev is contending with the crisis in lithuania 
which declared independence march 11 
the official chinse press before lis departure said his trip 
would have profound significance on peace in asia and the world 
china and the soviet union split over ideological differences in 
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969 in 1972 china restored 
relations with the united states in part because thenleader mao 
tsetung saw the soviet union as chinas most serious military 
threat 
western diplomats in beijing said china has stressed it will 
never be a docile soviet ally as it was in the 1950s and they 
noted that chinas inherent suspicions of soviet aims have grown 
with gorbachevs reform policies 
the ideological hardliners who now rule china reportedly blame 
gorbachev for the fall of communist parties in eastern europe and 
see perestroika gorbachevs program of political and economic 
reform as leading to the demise of socialism 
tass said both the soviet union and china agreed that the latest 
rounds of talks will not presage a return to the relationship of 
the 1950s but the departure from the confrontation that existed 
in the past 
the news agency said the two sides have shown readiness to 
reduce troops deployed in the area of the sovietchinese border and 
have agreed to a treaty on the reductions 
it said the current talks will enable the two countries to 
improve cooperation in trade economic scientifictechnical 
cultural and other areas 
the last chinese premier to visit moscow was lis foster father 
chouenlai who met thensoviet leaders leonid brezhnev and alexei 
kosygin in 1964 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen deputy chief of general 
staff xu xin and lis wife zhu lin accompanied the premier on his 
visit

the white house said today that the united 
states will not deal for hostages and it will take the 
unconditional release of all those still in captivity in lebanon to 
open the door towards better relations with iran 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said preliminary reports 
from a us air force hospital in wiesbaden west germany indicate 
robert polhill is malnourished and dehydrated but in 
relatively good condition after being freed sunday after 39 
months in captivity 
fitzwater did not say what the united states would do next but 
said we are not going to trade for hostages however or make 
deals 
we do not know what was the specific motivation for the 
release we have always believed that iran has control or at least 
influence over the hostage holders he said iran has been 
supportive of mr polhills release we appreciate that 
he said debriefing of polhill was just beginning the only 
information we have is that he was with fellow teachers jesse 
turner and alann steen throughout most of his captivity up until 
the last few days but i dont have any other details other than 
they are alive and he was with them 
he echoed the hard line that bush struck after learning of the 
release sunday while fishing off the florida keys 
as the president said yesterday we want the release of all 
hostages that would open the door towards better relations with 
iran said fitzwater 
fitzwater said the united states is also looking for an 
accounting as to the status of the two missing hostages william 
buckley and lt col richard higgins both believed killed by 
their captors 
bush said he would make no gesture towards iran or others until 
all the hostages are free 
this is a mission uncompleted there are other americans held 
against their will bush said in islamorada fla after speaking 
by telephone with polhill 
john kelly the assistant secretary of state for near eastern 
and south asian affairs said today that bushs policy on the 
hostages is very clear we dont make deals 
however kelly appearing on nbctvs today show said 
were going to be talking to the syrians we have been in contact 
indirectly with iran and were going to keep working as hard as we 
can on this issue asked if release of another hostage was 
imminent kelly said its too early to say with any certainty 
whether that will be the case but we certainly hope it is 
bushs initial written reaction made a small bow in irans 
direction 
the written statement thanked those who had a hand in the 
release particularly the governments of syria and iran whose 
efforts have contributed to the release of this hostage 
syrias role was obvious as its diplomats arranged to pick 
polhill up in beirut from his captors then whisked him to safety in 
damascus 
however bush omitted iran from his words of appreciation in a 
facetoface meeting with reporters he said i cant tell you i 
honestly know what irans role in the release is but id have 
goodwill to those who facilitated the release if that included 
iran absolutely 
his spokesman marlin fitzwater said there were no deals no 
negotiations with the hostagetakers we have no way of identifying 
any specific action on our part that could have been a contributing 
factor to the release 
bush who last week refused the kidnappers request that he send 
envoy john kelly to damascus said he felt great joy but i 
dont have forgiveness in my heart as long as one american is held 
against his will 
i will carry the burden of the other hostages with me until 
every single one of them is free he said theres not a night 
goes by that i dont think about it 
the tehran times newspaper said in an editorial today that 
another hostage should be freed to test president bushs claim 
that goodwill begets goodwill meanwhile irans foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati was quoted today by the official 
syrian arab news agency as saying the proiranian extremists in 
lebanon wanted a quick reciprocal move 
the united states maintains that iran has influence over the 
groups still holding the americans and 10 other westerners in 
lebanon 
the hostages include terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press kidnapped on march 16 
1985 polhill was a hostage for almost 39 months along with two 
fellow american teachers at beirut university college who ignored 
us warnings to leave the wartorn country 
bush told reporters on sunday im not trying to think up any 
gestures to make toward iran 
im not making gestures i dont trade for hostages i dont 
go ante up one step and another he said 
on the soviet crackdown against lithuania bush said he has not 
yet decided what action to take the white house said friday that 
bush would confer with leaders of congress early this week after 
completing consultations with us allies 
bush received word of polhills release by shiptoshore phone 
as he was fishing in the everglades with national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and other 
bush began his observance of sundays earth day on an islamorada 
beach at sunrise honoring activists who work to protect the keys 
coral reefs and announcing an effort to declare the waters within 
10 miles of the keys off limits to big ships and oil freighters

civil rights leaders sent up a chorus of praise 
for the rev ralph david abernathy saying they preferred to 
remember him for his contributions to the cause rather than for the 
controversy that followed him to the grave 
about 2000 people attended a memorial service sunday at the 
baptist church where the rev martin luther kings closest friend 
and chief lieutenant had been pastor since 1961 abernathy died of 
a heart attack tuesday at age 64 
officials at abernathys church west hunter street baptist 
said about 2500 people had filed through the church sunday and 
this morning to pay their respects

church abernathy was to be taken to his crypt at a in a muledrawn 
wagon the symbol of humility he had suggested for kings funeral 
the motorcade was to travel along martin luther king jr drive 
among those who had worked closely with abernathy gone was any 
trace of outrage for writing in his autobiography about kings 
alleged marital infidelity abernathy was branded a judas last year 
because of the passages 
theres always been unity even when theres been 
disagreement said former mayor andrew young now a candidate for 
governor i wouldnt be doing what im doing now if ralph had not 
been where he was doing what he was doing 
we must judge him on what he meant to our struggle and he was 
high up on the honor roll said jesse jackson i think those 
who would focus on a point they may disagree on must mix the bitter 
with the sweet and it comes out much sweeter 
abernathy who with king founded the southern christian 
leadership conference worked with him to organize the montgomery 
ala bus boycott marched with him in selma ala and in 
washington and cradled his bloody head when he was cut down by an 
assassins bullet in memphis tenn in 1968

that fell down 
on sunday mourners some carrying children walked past the 
coffin and several touched the sleeves of abernathys white 
ministerial robe those attending included robert f kennedy jr

the supreme court today raised the possibility 
that minnesota officials may enforce a traffic safety law against 
certain members of an amish sect in rural fillmore county 
the court set aside a minnesota supreme court ruling that barred 
such enforcement 
the justices told the state court to reconsider the case in 
light of their decision last week allowing states to outlaw the 
religious use of the illegal drug peyote 
in a brief order today issued over two dissenting votes the 
court said the minnesota court should restudy the amish controversy 
after examining the peyote ruling from oregon 
in that case members of the native american church contended 
that punishing the religious use of peyote violated religious 
freedom 
in the minnesota case the state supreme court ruled that 
requiring the amish to display a slowmoving vehicle warning 
emblem on the back of their horsedrawn buggies violated their 
religious freedom 
a state law requires that slowmoving vehicles display a 
yelloworange triangular emblem to warn other drivers the law 
provided for one alternative a black and white triangular emblem 
not all members of the amish sect living in fillmore county in 
southeastern minnesota near the iowa border object to the emblem 
but 14 who did were issued citations for refusing to attach the 
emblems to their black buggies 
the 14 say the loud colors and worldly symbols conflict with 
biblical admonitions against putting their faith in anything but 
god 
a state trial judge ruled that enforcing the traffic law against 
the 14 amish members did not violate any right but the minnesota 
supreme court unanimously threw out all charges against them last 
august 
the states highest court ruled that the requirement infringed 
on the exercise of a sincerely held religious belief and most 
importantly the states compelling interest in traffic safety 
could be served by a lessrestrictive requirement 
noting that the amish do not object to outlining their buggies 
with silver reflective tape or to displaying red lit lanterns to 
supplement the tape the state supreme court said there does 
exist a less restrictive alternative to serve the states public 
safety concerns 
in the appeal acted on today county attorney robert r benson 
argued that the state court impermissibly advances religion by 
allowing the amish special rights which individuals outside that 
religious group cannot enjoy 
lawyers for the amish said benson is wrong 
there is ample room for legislatures and courts to craft 
religious accommodations and yet not establish or advance 
religion they said the minnesota supreme court has not 
established religion by allowing the amish to use reflective tape 
and the traditional red lantern on their buggies instead of forcing 
them to use an orange fluorescent or black worldly symbol 
justices john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor dissented 
from the high courts action today without stating their reasons 
the case is minnesota vs hershberger 89804

about 100 inmates remained on the roof 
of a prison on the outskirts of bristol today following a night of 
violence that left three guards injured 
authorities also reported overnight trouble at long lartin a 
high security prison in evesham northwest of london where an 
inmate took another prisoner hostage and held him in a cell at 
knifepoint 
authorites speculated that the disturbance at the pucklechurch 
remand center near bristol in western england may have been 
inspired by the riot 23 days ago at manchesters strangeways prison 
seven inmates remained on the strangeways roof today while 
prison negotiators continued what they called their softly 
softly strategy for talking the men down 
officials at pucklechurch said they would be more aggressive 
about retaking the wing of the facility held by the prisoners 
our intention is to retake the occupied areas of the 
establishment as quickly as possible using the minimum amount of 
force necessary for that aim said mick cook a spokesman for 
pucklechurch 
it was not known what caused the riot at pucklechurch the 
strangeways riot was sparked by overcrowding but authorities said 
pucklechurch is not overcrowded 
at pucklechurch about 120 inmates snatched a prison officer 
late sunday as they returned from the exercise yard they took away 
his keys released other prisoners and then freed him less than an 
hour later authorities said 
the prisoners climbed on the roof and began hurling missiles 
onto the staff 
three prison officers were injured including one officer who 
required hospitalization after being hit in the face with a brick 
before dawn today prison staff had retaken the central wing one 
of three wings in the male section authorities said 
a home office spokesman speaking on condition he not be 
identified said 20 prisoners had given themselves up the inmates 
who spent the night on the roof lit fires to keep warm 
the remaining prisoners were locked in the other wings and more 
than 40 female prisoners were moved out of pucklechurch 
a senior member of the prison staff said special contingency 
plans had been put into operation and officers from other prisons 
trained in control and restraint techniques were called in to the 
scene 
the home office spokesman said there were no indications over 
the weekend that a disturbance was likely 
at long lartin efforts continued through the night to persuade 
the captor to give up his victim but the rest of the jail was 
quiet the home office spokesman said 
it was not known if the hostagetaker had made any specific 
demands 
on april 4 prison staff at long lartin foiled a breakout 
attempt by nine inmates who were caught as they cut through an 
inner perimeter wire fence at the same time 32 other inmates 
staged a demonstration and barricaded themselves into one of the 
prisons wings for 13 hours before surrendering

the supreme court today agreed to use the case 
of a mississippi death row inmate to provide new guidelines for 
police questioning of suspects 
the court said it will hear an appeal by robert s minnick a 
convicted murderer who said his confession was unlawful because he 
was denied his right to have a lawyer present 
minnick and james monkey dyess escaped from clarke county 
miss jail in april 1986 and went looking for guns authorities 
said 
police said the two men fatally shot donald ellis thomas and 
lamar lafferty when the victims returned to thomass mobile home to 
find minnick and dyess there 
minnick was arrested in lemon grove calif on aug 22 1986 
fbi agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a 
lawyer minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to 
answer any more questions 
a few days later deputy sheriff jc denham of clarke county 
flew to california and questioned minnick the defendant confessed 
to murder saying he shot lafferty because dyess was threatening to 
kill minnick if he did not 
minnick was convicted in mississippi and sentenced to death 
he said in his appeal that his rights were violated because he 
never agreed to talk to denham without a lawyer present 
the mississippi supreme court upheld his conviction ruling use 
of the confession was lawful 
the state court said since minnick previously had talked to a 
lawyer but still agreed to speak to denham his right to have a 
lawyer was not violated 
the state court said denhams questioning of minnick did not 
violate the rule the us supreme court established in 1981 when it 
barred police from questioning a suspect who has asked for a lawyer 
unless the suspect initiates the conversation 
the case is minnick vs mississippi 896332

lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis said today that mikhail s gorbachev is staking 
everything on the lithuanian crisis by not excluding the use of 
soviet troops in the baltic republic 
landsbergis also asked the lithuanian parliament the supreme 
council to draw up emergency plans to deal with mass layoffs 
expected in the republic because of the kremlins economic blockade 
the republic of 38 million began its first full work week since 
the soviet president cut off supplies of oil natural gas and other 
raw materials to the republic which declared independence on march 
11 
vilnius main thouroughfare gedimina street was practically 
devoid of vehicles today as lithuanians struggled with gasoline 
rationing that limits them to about seven gallons per month bus 
service among cities also was curtailed sharply 
on sunday lithuania halted exports to soviet republics and 
foreign customers claiming moscow was imposing a total embargo 
but also sunday a visiting soviet official denied any general 
blockade existed 
the british broadcasting corp meanwhile quoted gorbachevs 
senior military adviser marshall sergei akhromeyev as saying the 
red army wont hesitate to use force to crush illegal protests in 
lithuania 
if the lithuanian separatists break the law then we will take 
measures to enforce the law i am not afraid of using force if 
necessary he said in an interview for broadcast on the bbcs 
panorama program 
when asked about akhromeyevs comments lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis told reporters we must worry about such 
insanity its military madness force is always a real threat as 
long as there is no willingness to use politics if they use force 
in lithuania it means they would be prepared to use force in the 
world 
according to a parliamentary spokeswoman rita dapkus 
landsbergis later told lawmakers that by refusing to rule out the 
use of force gorbachev was staking everything the lithuanian 
president used cardplayers slang that gorbachev was playing the 
bank literally risking all 
there are signs from the ussr that raise worries 
landsbergis added according to ms dapkus president gorbachev 
is being placed in the artificial position that plays the role of 
putting the rest of the world into a dilemma of whom to support 
lithuania or gorbachev 
ms dapkus said landsbergis called this an artificial ploy 
soviet troops have used force twice already to round up 
lithuanian army deserters and to occupy a vilnius printing plant 
in moscow arkady maslennikov gorbachevs press secretary said 
today the kremlin might negotiate with lithuania if it freezes its 
declaration of independence for two years 
but maslennikov made it clear the breakaway republic also would 
have to admit it is subject to the soviet constitution lithuanian 
leaders refuse to do that saying the republic was forcibly annexed 
by the soviet union in 1940 
soviet leaders are willing to talk to lithuanian officials if 
they acknowledge jurisdiction of the soviet constitution either 
by rescinding or freezing the independence decisions maslennikov 
said at a press briefing 
over the weekend landsbergis denied reports the declaration of 
independence would be frozen for two years in hopes of reaching a 
compromise with moscow 
maslennikov said he did not know if any soviet leaders would 
meet a lithuanian delegation that arrived today it depends on 
what theyve come with 
ms dapku quoted landsbergis as saying parliament should draft 
an emergency plan for when gorbachevs economic blockade starts 
throwing lithuanians out of work 
we have to think about what we will suggest to the people how 
to act in an extreme situation when they will lose their jobs 
she quoted him as saying 
the embargo is expected to take jobs from 70 percent of the 
republics workforce of 500000 people 
landsbergis referred to gorbachevs embargo as a total 
blockade 
a soviet official on sunday denied that any general blockade 
existed 
plans for a total blockade dont exist said andrei n 
girenko a communist party central committee member 
however lithuanian deputy premier romualdas ozolas said sunday 
lithuanian ports have stopped loading goods bound for foreign 
countries and stopped sending some products to other soviet 
republics 
lithuania said in a telegram to soviet premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov the soviet cutoff would choke lithuanian processing and 
manufacturing of goods meant both for export and for the soviet 
domestic market 
a leningrad journalist said today long lines already were 
forming at gasoline stations in that city as residents feared that 
refined petroleum products processed in lithuania would be cut back 
gorbachev said last week he would halt the shipment to lithuania 
of exportable products unless lithuania backs away from measures 
furthering its independence decree 
an embargo on oil and most natural gas began wednesday and 
ozolas said lithuanias only oil refinery at mazhiekiai would 
shut down today 
lithuania and itsd baltic neighbors latvia and estonia are 
trying to restore independence lost in 1940 when they were forcibly 
annexed by the soviet union

along the ceasefire line kashmir pakistan ap gunfire 
erupts nightly along the ceasefire line that weaves through the 
spectacular snowcovered peaks and lush freshly tilled valleys of 
disputed kashmir 
pakistani and indian soldiers crouched in their camouflaged 
bunkers only yards apart routinely take pot shots at each other 
raising fears that a fourth war could break out between the two 
nations 
any time any place they can come we can take them col 
naeem abid of pakistan boasted from his commamd center at pandu 
overlooking one of the most explosive spots along a ceasefire line 
that splits the former princely state of kashmir between india and 
paksitan 
a pakistani flag still flies from an indian bunker at chakhoti 
thousands of feet almost directly below pandu 
they are afraid we will shoot at them if they try to take it 
down abid said there is fear in their minds 
three pakistanis died putting that flag up in february they 
were shot when indian border guards opened fire on a crowd of 
several thousand people mostly students who swarmed across the 
border 
keeping the flag in place has now become a matter of pride for 
the pakistan soldiers guarding the area abid said 
time passes slowly for soldiers manning the remote peaks of the 
pir panjal mountain range foreign journalists visited their 
bunkers sunday during a helicopter tour of the ceasefire line 
arranged by pakistans government 
both countries talk of war and the latest rhetoric between the 
governments in islamabad and new delhi dominates long evening 
conversations abid said 
twice the two neighbors have gone to war over kashmir in 1948 
and in 1965 a third war was fought over bangladesh or what was 
then east pakistan 
if its forced upon us well teach them a lesson abid 
said 
the normal indian troop strength along the 490mile ceasefire 
line is 245000 military and paramilitary troops said a pakistan 
defense ministry spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules 
the indian government does not disclose such numbers 
the pakistani spokesman said india has deployed another 70000 
throughout jammukashmir state indias only moslem state 
most of those soldiers he said are assigned to quell a moslem 
secessionist uprising that has claimed at least 292 lives since 
jan 20 when the indian government ordered a crackdown 
the militants once demanded that the kashmir valley become part 
of pakistan but now they want independence and the status of a 
neutral nation 
pakistan has 100000 soldiers along the ceasefire line which 
was negotiated and now monitored by un peacekeeping forces 
india regularly accuses pakistan of fomenting violence in its 
troubled state a charge as often denied by pakistan 
the accusations have intensified in recent weeks with each side 
accusing the other of preparing for war 
the foreign ministers of india and pakistan are attending a un 
session on third world economies in new york this week and they 
have indicated they may meet privately to try to defuse tensions 
between their countries 
from a helicopter flying along the ceasefire line sunday there 
was little evidence of a troop buildup on pakistans side only 
sporadic traffic moved on the roads snaking through the mountain 
passes 
being on the border we have to be on maximum alert be it day 
or night said lt col abdul rasheed 
he spoke from his isolated outpost 7800 feet up in the 
mountains at chirikot rasheeds compound with its labyrinth of 
tunnels and underground bunkers was the first stop on the 
helicopter tour along the ceasefire line 
indian and pakistani soldiers at chirikot had exchanged gunfire 
for about five hours on saturday he said 
it happens every night rasheed said 
two days earlier a 14yearold girl was rushed to the hospital 
with gunshot wounds he said they resort to shooting civilians 
we resent that he said they are intentionally provoking us 
new delhi says civilians shot along the border are en route to 
pakistan for training and weapons to continue their violent 
insurgency in jammukashmir 
the entire population of the village of khantawal only miles 
inside indianheld kashmir fled to pakistan about one week ago 
accusing indian border guards of a litany of abuses 
while pakistan denies training and arming the militants 
thousands are reportedly in pakistanheld kashmir 
in a small tent village on the grounds of an abandoned factory 
in muzzaffarabad the capital of azad free kashmir about 70 
young boys wait for weapons 
we want weapons guns rocket launchers pistols 
everything said salim 20 who uses only one name 
but pakistan still is not doing anything for us

junk bond king michael milken will not have to 
name names of wall street cheats in exchange for being allowed to 
plead guilty a source says 
the arrangement differs sharply from the deal reached by 
milkens accuser ivan boesky who was required to give evidence 
against others in exchange for leniency after he was accused of 
running an insider trading network in 1986 
part of boeskys deal was he would cooperate and turn on 
others a person who was briefed on milkens plea deal said 
sunday that has nothing to do with michael milkens settlement 
milken though will face questioning from the justice 
department and the securities and exchange commission if his plea 
is approved by us district judge kimba wood such questioning is 
standard in criminal guilty pleas 
that would be a real victory for him and i think a real 
victory for his clients and the whole junk bond structure alan 
bromberg a securities law professor at southern methodist 
university said of the reported terms of the plea bargain 
milken on friday agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 
600 million in penalties to settle charges contained in a 98count 
fraud and racketeering indictment handed up a year ago 
prosecutors are expected to recommend a prison term of about 
five years for milken the 600 million fine is the largest ever 
against an individual and is said to cover both criminal and civil 
penalties after his indictment milken set aside about 700 
million to guarantee payment in the event of conviction 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the deal 
precludes any further criminal prosecution of milken who 
spearheaded some of the biggest takeovers of the 1980s as head of 
drexel burnham lambert incs junk bond department 
milken 43 controlled a network of buyers and sellers in the 
200 billion market for the highyield debt securities and was 
widely believed to have knowledge the government may been able to 
use in its probe of illicit trading 
the us attorneys office had given milken until last friday to 
accept a settlement or face a new expanded indictment 
barring lastminute changes milken is to enter the guilty plea 
on tuesday a hearing before wood was scheduled for tuesday 
morning according to the judges office 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
newberg were charged in the indictment which alleged securities 
law violations in several takeovers 
the plea bargain contains no insider trading or racketeering 
charges and the government agreed to drop its case against lowell 
milken that was said to be a key component of milkens decision to 
plead guilty the specific charges in the plea were not revealed 
milken had maintained innocence since he was linked to illegal 
trading in 1986 by boesky who pleaded guilty to one charge paid 
100 million and cooperated with investigators boeskys testimony 
led to convictions from or guilty pleas by several wall street 
figures 
milkens plea agreement apparently does not settle charges 
against newberg lawyers for newberg said sunday they had not been 
contacted by the government about their clients status 
in a related case newberg was convicted last year of 
racketeering and securities faud in connection with illegal tax 
trading by princetonnewport partners a nowdefunct securities 
firm he was sentenced to three months in prison 
it also was unclear whether any action would be taken against 
individuals who had received target letters from the government 
last year indicating they would be charged in a new milken 
indictment 
drexel last year pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to 
pay 650 million to settle related fraud charges the firm 
collapsed in february and is liquidating

a train carrying a caustic chemical and 
crude oil derailed and exploded spewing about 100000 gallons of 
oil and releasing a chemical cloud that forced 200 people to 
evacuate 
twentynine cars in a 97car buffalo amp pittsburgh railroad 
freight train jumped the tracks in a steep ravine along buffalo 
creek late sunday john h bell the railways vice president said 
today 
at the fires peak flames shooting several hundred feet high 
could be seen 30 miles away at midmorning the fire was still 
burning but was under control authorities said 
bell said only a small amount of the spilled oil leaked into 
buffalo creek a tributary of the allegheny river and that it 
didnt appear to be a threat to drinking water 
in addition to the oil one tanker leaked sodium hydroxide that 
sent a chemical cloud drifting toward worthington causing 200 
people to be moved from their homes overnight all but 50 had 
returned by midmorning said worthington fire chief don grafton 
he said about 300 people were told to be on standby for possible 
evacuation this morning but that the danger posed by the cloud 
appeared to be easing 
a dike collected most of the sodium hydroxide a caustic 
substance used to clean drains bell said it can cause oil to 
ignite according to a 1980 department of transportation hazardous 
materials handbook 
at late morning crews were using hoses to suck oil and sodium 
hydroxide from the ground 
what a weird time time for this to happen on earth day 
said one resident the rev sharon schwab maybe it will make 
people begin to realize that we need to do things so this sort of 
thing doesnt happen as often as it does now she said she heard 
a strange noise from the train like something was dragging or 
hitting the tracks wrong before the accident 
the 12 oil tankers that derailed carried more than 300000 
gallons of oil bell said about 100000 gallons give or take a 
few thousand had leaked from four ruptured cars he said the 
other eight oil tankers derailed but didnt rupture 
except for the tanker carrying the sodium hydroxide the other 
train cars carried miscellaneous freight 
firefighters had the fire under control to a point when 
officials decided to let the oil burn away said bob walker the 
director of hazardous materials handling for armstrong countys 
emergency services office 
theres product in buffalo creek but its dark and the crude 
is black betsy mallison a spokeswoman for the state department 
of environmental resources said early today were focusing on 
making sure areas are diked and boomed to keep most of the product 
out of the creek 
its so hot and volatile and its difficult for firemen to get 
in there and get a close look she said 
buffalo creek flows into the allegheny river 10 to 15 miles 
downstream communities along the allegheny were told they might 
have to close their drinking water intake valves 
dead fish were starting to rise to the surface in a twomile 
stretch of buffalo creek said emil svetahor spokesman for the 
state fish commission 
three firefighters suffered chemical burns but their injuries 
were not serious said ms mallison a mobile home was damaged 
there was an instant when that one fireball went up that i 
thought it was coming right on us because you could feel the 
heat said one evacuee rose davis 46 who lives in a trailer 
park near west franklin township it lit our yard up like 
daylight you could hear the roaring of the fire 
the cause of the derailment was under investigation the two 
train operators who werent injured were undergoing drug and 
alcohol tests under the punxsatawneybased companys policy bell 
said 
the train derailed as earth day festivities wound down 45 miles 
away at pittsburghs point state park where an estimated 40000 
celebrated the environmental awareness day

without water earlier this month after a pipeline broke and spilled

his troops arrested the rebels and were in control of this east 
african nation he did not mention any casualty figures or the 
number of arrests 
all those involved in the attempt have been arrested those 
who are in active military service and those who are retired 
elbashir said in a speech broadcast at midday over radio omduran 
the official government station 
elbashir said the coup plotters had been under surveillance 
from the start of the takeover attempt 
without elaborating elbashir said the abortive coup was 
masterminded by the alliance in coalition with the outlaws 
the government has often used the term outlaws to refer to 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army which has been waging a 
sevenyear insurgency seeking autonomy for the countrys southern 
region 
the alliance was possibly a reference to political parties 
disbanded by elbashir after he took control of the country june 30 
an official government spokesman said todays coup attempt was a 
continuation of a bid uncovered in march to topple the military 
government 
authorities took measures to prevent the move from the start 
after receiving information that rebel officers were planning 
todays coup attempt said government spokesman mohammed khogali 
salihein 
he said todays attempted coup was plotted by two retired 
officers maj gen abdulkadir alkadaru and brig gen mohammed 
osman hamid karrar he said both officers were in custody but no 
civilians had been arrested 
informed sources in the capital of khartoum said the army 
appeared to have had little trouble putting down a series of 
attacks led by junior army officers 
the sudanese sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the attempted coup began at midnight and the rebels tried to take 
over khartoum airport and official government radio but were 
quickly overpowered 
the sources said several officers tried to shoot their way into 
the armed forces general command in khartoum apparently in search 
of elbashir but could not get through the front gate 
they said a guard at the general command was wounded in the hand 
khartoum airport was closed briefly and telecommunications cut 
for several hours but by midmorning khartoum was peaceful 
it was an attempted coup around midnight by a small number of 
very lowlevel officers said a source who said he details came 
from people at the general command 
they tried to take over the airport and the radio in a rather 
pathetic way and were very unsuccessful the source said 
tanks were seen on vital bridges and around the general command 
the army was on full alert but overall security did not seem 
heightened in the streets of the capital 
in a dispatch from khartoum egypts staterun middle east news 
agency said the coup attempt involved junior officers but was 
masterminded by some retired officers it did not identify them 
in late march the official sudan news agency reported that a 
number of civilians and military officers were arrested for 
allegedly planning a coup 
later elbashir was quoted as saying that only 20 people were 
involved and that investigations were under way 
the junta seized power june 30 by overthrowing prime minister 
sadek elmahdis civilian government 
at the time elbashir said his principal aims were to end the 
7yearold civil war in the south and improve the countrys 
beleaguered economy he has had little success

a veterinary surgical team began a risky 
caesarean section operation today to help babe a 36yearold asian 
elephant deliver a calf after her labor stopped five days ago 
the sevenmember team led by dr michael schmit a veterinarian 
from the washington park zoo in portland ore began preparations 
for the surgery at about 11 am after drugs administered to the 
7700pound elephant failed to induce labor 
everybodys kind of nervous weve got several hours worth of 
surgery ahead said yvonne pelletreau a spokeswoman at the 
burnet park zoo 
it will be the third time the veterinary team has attempted a 
csection on an asian elephant she said only one of the 
operations was successful she said 
babe would become the oldest firsttime elephant mother to give 
birth in a north american zoo 
babe began labor wednesday but stopped it early thursday 
female elephants have the ability to stop their labor when they are 
feeling pain and it is not unusual for elephants to take up to five 
days to deliver a calf but zoo officials became concerned about 
both mother and infant as the delay continued 
on saturday a group of four veterinarians from cornell 
university checked babe and found that her cervix was probably too 
small for her calf to pass through they injected her with 
estrabiol to start her cervix dilating said pelletreau 
the drug had some effect but not enough so on sunday the 
veterinarians gave babe a second injection she said 
that second injection caused the elephants cervix to widen 
enough for a calf to pass early today the veterinarians gave babe 
ocytocin a laborinducing drug but it didnt work she said 
babe is one of eight asian elephants currently pregnant in north 
american zoos a second burnet park elephant romani is expected 
to give birth in july 1991 
asian elephants are an endangered species that number fewer than 
45000 in the wild

demonstrators clashed with police 
throughout the capital of katmandu today in the first major 
violence since the nation returned to democracy two weeks ago 
witnesses said ten people were reported killed and 72 injured 
in todays clashes six policemen were beaten to death by 
protesters and four demonstrators were fatally shot by police 
witnesses said 
the violence broke out when a mob of several hundred paraded 
three unconscious and bleeding men through the streets the group 
claimed its captives were policemen belonging to a banned 
rightwing gang called mandale which was once allied with the 
monarchy and is now blamed for an outbreak of looting mugging and 
arson 
police opened fire in at least four places as the mob with the 
three captives marched toward the royal palace some men were 
beating the three unconscious captives who were tied together in a 
sitting position on a pushcart others chanted birendra thief 
leave the country 
on april 8 king birendra yielded to a groundswell of 
prodemocracy demonstrations and lifted a 29year ban on political 
parties 
the march was halted by police who rescued the three 
unconscious men accused of belonging to mandale 
two of the captives died and were identified as policemen after 
their bodies were brought to bir hospital where the third man was 
in serious condition his identity was not immediately known 
four civilians who died of bullet wounds were also brought to 
bir hospital doctors said it was not immediately known whether 
they were part of the march on the palace or were shot in other 
locations 
four policemen were beaten to death by a mob that attacked a 
police station in katmandus western teku neighborhood according 
to a reporter who witnessed the killings and spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said police at teku initially fired tear gas then warning 
shots in the air and finally gunshots into the crowd it was not 
known if there were any casualties 
crowds were seen attacking at least six other police stations 
demonstrators also set fire to a twostory building housing offices 
of the general commissioner the top civil administrator for the 
katmandu region 
doctors at two local hospitals said the injured included 24 
people with bullet wounds and 14 others who were suffering from 
stab wounds inflicted by the mob other people were injured in the 
stampede as crowds dispersed 
police imposed a curfew in central katmandu 
earlier today irate residents beat 12 suspected mandale members 
with iron rods and then set fire to four police jeeps accusing the 
police of failing to protect them the cabinets home minister said 
when the minister yog prasad upadhyay and hem bahadur singh 
nepals top police official went to the scene of the beatings 
they were surrounded by hundreds of people who forced them to 
address a public meeting and later pounded their jeep 
the rage stems from the growing wave of arson looting and 
muggings that followed this himalayan kingdoms return to democracy 
victims and other witnesses say the attacks are the work of the 
mandale after the group was banned in 1979 they say it went 
underground and served as a vigilante squad supporting nepals old 
nonpartisan system 
the prodemocracy movement was launched feb 18 by two banned 
political groups the two dominate a government that took office 
thursday 
the movement snowballed until april 6 when 200000 
demonstrators marched on the royal palace police opened fire 
killing up to 200 people according to witnesses the kings 
government maintained that only 10 people were killed

afghanistans moslem guerrillas 
monday called on their archenemy president najib to test his 
popularity in an election but not under the banner of his 
communiststyle party 
the loose broadly defined proposal for a nonparty election 
represents a major concession by the seven guerrilla groups 
fighting for 12 years to overthrow the sovietbacked government in 
kabul 
the proposal came as rockets slammed into the afghan capital 
hitting a mosque and others sites and killing 19 people and 
wounding 11 radio kabul said the report blamed the usbacked 
guerrillas for the attack 
were talking about general elections and that means everybody 
can participate said azim nasserzia an author of the plan and 
a spokesman for the national islamic front of afghanistan a 
moderate guerrilla group 
but the plan drew a cool response from the kabul governments 
highestranking diplomat in pakistan charge daffaires qudrahullah 
ahmadi 
we gave our proposal three years ago for a sixmonth 
ceasefire followed by elections we are ready for those 
elections ahmadi said the guerrillas however have rejected 
the ceasefire 
theyll eventually come over to our proposal he said 
the guerrillas who have spent as much time fighting each other 
as they have najibs troops have come under heavy pressure from 
the united states and other financial backers to close ranks and 
come up with a political solution to the protracted war 
senior us officials in islamabad said guerrilla leaders have 
been warned that their multimillion dollar weapons pipeline could 
dry up next year 
washington annually ships between 500 million and 700 million 
worth of military supplies to the guerrillas also known as the 
mujahedeen they are also financed by pakistan saudi arabia and 
other sympathetic arab states moscow reportedly pumps billions of 
dollars worth of supplies to kabul 
skeptics among the rebels say talk of elections is a stalling 
tactic to satisfy the doves while the hawks prepare for one last 
fighting season 
spring weather is melting the snow on afghanistans rugged 
mountain passes and allowing rebel fighters to resupply their 
positions inside the country 
the guerrillas control nearly 80 percent of the countryside but 
have yet to capture a major city najibs forces have failed to 
make significant military gains leading to calls for a political 
settlement to the bloody stalement 
najib has repeatedly offered to negotiate peace anytime 
anywhere and on any terms with the guerrillas in the last year the 
rebels and their backers rejected the offer demanding najib step 
down first 
washington later said najib could stay during peace talks but 
would eventually have to go before elections a condition kabul 
rejects 
while guerrilla leaders appear ready to compromise on najibs 
participation nasserzia added under no circumstances could 
elections be held under najib or the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan 
the proposal was drafted by a national islamic front of 
afghanistan leader pir sayed ahmed gailani it calls for a united 
nations team to conduct elections in areas controlled by the 
government and for representatives of the organization of islamic 
countries to monitor polls in guerrillaheld areas 
voters would elect representatives to a traditional afghan 
jirga or grand assembly which would choose the person to form a 
new government 
the plan the latest in a series drafted over the past year was 
outlined at a meeting sunday with pakistan president ghulam ishaq 
khan and prime minister benazir bhutto

rival black factions clashed 
with guns and knives and attacked homes during the weekend killing 
at least 13 people including two black police officers 
authorities said monday 
police said 11 people were killed during the weekend in 
factional fighting in natal province the dead included a 
15yearold boy and a 70yearold woman who were shot in separate 
incidents police said 
police gave few details on the fighting in other parts of the 
nation two black police officers were killed in separate incidents 
in cape province and natal police said 
police backed up by south african army troops arrested about 70 
people in a sweep sunday through a black township near 
viljoenskroon in orange free state police said police declined to 
say why the suspects were rounded up 
the citizen newspaper reported monday that police had said they 
would not allow extreme rightwing whites to form private militias 
police officials said such groups were stockpiling weapons and were 
a threat to law and order 
we reject the concept of any militant rightwing 
organizations because we cannot allow any member of the public to 
take the law into his own hands a police spokesman capt peet 
bothma was quoted as saying 
extreme rightwing groups that oppose giving blacks political 
rights have claimed to be forming armed units several air force 
members and rightwingers have been arrested on charges of helping 
steal air force guns last week for an extremist group 
on sunday african national congress leader nelson mandela 
called for intensified armed struggle against the white government 
to force speeding up negotiations on the end of apartheid 
there can be no talk of a lasting peace while government 
agents continue to massacre people mandela said referring to 
three recent incidents of police firing on black protesters or 
hitting bystanders while shooting at rioters 
but mandela told a crowd estimated at 70000 in umtata the 
capital of transkei the homeland where he was born that only 
successful negotiations can convince us to end the armed struggle 
and peace will come as a result of negotiations it is not 
negotiations which will come as a result of peace 
president fw de klerk whose cabinet will hold talks with a 
mandelaled anc delegation next week has said the ancs continued 
calls for armed struggle are an obstacle to formal negotiations on 
a new constitution which would give the black majority the vote 
de klerk said in an interview broadcast by british television on 
sunday that he was strongly opposed to war talk and considered 
it a stumbling block in the way of negotiations 
south africa has been hit by a wave of violence in recent weeks 
that has claimed hundreds of lives much of the violence involves 
power struggles between rival black groups that disagree over plans 
for a future south africa

an oregon woman who does not want to share 
parenting rights with the california man who donated his sperm for 
her artificial insemination lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that kevin 
mcintyre is entitled to a trial in seeking to prove he donated 
sperm only after linden crouch said she would let him help raise 
the child 
ms crouch says no such agreement was made 
nationwide more than 20000 children are born each year through 
artificial insemination the court was told 
in most cases women are inseminated with sperm obtained through 
a sperm bank from donors who remain anonymous to them but 
mcintyre from moraga calif has known ms crouch from ashland 
ore for over 13 years 
ms crouch gave birth to a daughter glenellen susan on nov 
24 1986 after being artificially impregnated with sperm she had 
asked mcintyre to donate 
he says ms crouch told him before he agreed to donate his sperm 
that she wanted him to share parenting with her he says she also 
agreed to his request for visitation rights 
in other action today the high court 
agreed to use the case if a mississippi death row inmate to 
provide new guidelines for police questioning of suspects 
the court said it will hear an appeal by robert s minnick a 
convicted murderer who said his confession was unlawful because he 
was denied his right to have a lawyer present 
refused to reinstate the california murder conviction of a 
black panther party member who was shackled during his 17month 
trial 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
shackling at johnny spains trial violated his rights 
rejected an appeal by a utah city accused of unlawfully 
promoting religion by subsidizing the mormon church and by putting 
a church symbol on city property 
the court over one dissenting vote refused to kill a lawsuit 
that says the city violated the constitutionally required 
separation of church and state 
refused to give new life to a copyright lawsuit over actress 
shirley maclaines 1983 bestselling book out on a limb 
the court without comment let stand rulings that maclaines 
book about reincarnation and other spiritual subjects did not 
infringe the copyright of a 1977 book written by charles silva 
rejected an appeal by a former member of the church of 
scientology of california who wanted the church declared a phony 
religion 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by larry 
wollersheim of aspen colo 
still pending before the justices is an appeal by the church of 
scientology of california aimed at overturning a 25 million 
emotional distress award won by wollersheim 
rejected a chemical companys challenge to federal standards 
for clean water 
the court without comment left intact rules that govern more 
than 1000 factories producing organic chemicals plastics and 
synthetic fibers 
oregons artificial insemination law denies any parental rights 
to sperm donors who are not the womans husband 
the law states such donor shall have no right obligation or 
interest with respect to a child born as a result of the artificial 
insemination 
invoking that law a state trial judge threw out mcintyres 
lawsuit seeking parental rights 
but a state appeals court by a 21 vote reinstated his suit in 
1988 the appeals court said the state law when applied to 
mcintyre violated his constitutionally protected dueprocess 
rights 
the appeals court said mcintyre is entitled to a trial in 
jackson county ore on his allegation that ms crouch broke an 
oral agreement 
the oregon supreme court refused to hear ms crouchs ensuing 
appeal last nov 30 but postponed any trial until ms crouch could 
appeal to the nations highest court 
in the appeal acted on today ms crouchs lawyer argued mr 
mcintyres claim at the most and if proven is that he has lost a 
quantity of sperm because he was tricked by ms crouch 
this was conduct between private parties the appeal said 
the government was not involved so a liberty interest under the 
constitutions due process clause does not exist 
ms crouchs appeal said the appeals court ruling calls into 
question the legal relationships among donors fathers and children 
conceived by artificial insemination in oregon 
her appeal said most states have artificial insemination laws 
mcintyres lawyer urged the justices to reject ms crouchs 
appeal he said mcintyre had tried since 1980 to adopt a child and 
since 1983 had sought to have a child through a surrogate mother 
the case is crouch vs mcintyre 891424

mobs beat six policemen to death and 
security forces shot and killed five civilians during daylong riots 
monday that threatened the himalayan kingdoms transition to 
democracy 
the mobs accused police of condoning and sometimes joining an 
underground monarchist group blamed for a wave of crime that 
swelled up last week after a new government headed by prodemocracy 
leaders took office 
armed policemen in riot gear patrolled katmandu and its suburbs 
after the staterun radio announced a 10hour curfew beginning at 8 
pm 
doctors said 78 people were injured in the violence the worst 
since security forces opened fire april 6 on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
witnesses said as many as 200 people were killed that day but 
king birendras government said only 10 people died the killings 
and the burgeoning movement for democracy forced birendra to 
abolish his 29yearold system of government in which political 
parties were banned 
a new coalition government dominated by onceoutlawed political 
parties took office on thursday within 24 hours there was an 
outbreak of arson mugging and looting 
residents blamed the trouble on the mandale an outlawed 
organization composed of supporters of the old political system and 
the monarchy the mandale whose name means group in the nepali 
language went underground in 1979 when birendra officially banned 
it because of its violent tendencies 
in several neighborhoods residents set up local vigilante 
groups on sunday after receiving anonymous telephone threats that 
mandale members would raid their houses there appeared to be no 
political pattern to the people targeted 
mondays trouble started in the morning after residents captured 
three men dressed in police uniforms and accused them of belonging 
to the mandale 
the men were beaten and paraded on a pushcart through katmandu 
and around the walls of birendras palace 
the three unconscious men their bleeding heads lolling and 
faces puffed from beatings were tied together in a sitting 
position as the crowd continued to beat them and chant birendra 
thief leave the country 
more than six hours after the three were captured police broke 
up the procession and rescued the trio two of the men were dead on 
arrival at bir hospital and the third was in critical condition 
doctors who spoke on condition of anonymity said all three were 
policemen 
later groups of men and boys attacked police stations in at 
least eight other neighborhoods four more policemen were beaten to 
death according to an indian reporter who asked not to be 
identified 
police fired tear gas and rifles in several places throughout 
the capital in an effort to disperse the crowds 
in bir hospital where most of the casualties were taken five 
civilians had fatal bullet injuries doctors said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
they said 24 other people were hospitalized for treatment of 
bullet wounds at bir hospital and teaching hospital katmandus 
largest medical institutions 
fourteen other people were hospitalized with knife wounds the 
doctors said they were stabbed by mobs who accused them of 
belonging to the mandale 
most of the other casualties were beaten or were injured in 
stampedes 
this is threateneding the newfound democracy said 
rishikesh shaha a former foreign minister and now a prominent 
human rights activist these are not just teething troubles of 
democracy but more serious problems he also accused the mandale 
of instigating the violence 
the chief government spokesman radheshyam bista said prime 
minister krishna prasad bhattarai met king birendra for more than 
one hour monday night 
bhattarai a top leader of the nepali congress party and the 
prodemocracy movement later met with home minister yog prasad 
upadhyay and inspector general of police hem bahadur singh to 
review the situation bhattarai and others have said nepal may be

israeli officials on monday welcomed the 
release of a us hostage in lebanon but gave no indication that 
israel would comply with iranian demands that israel free a 
kidnapped lebanese shiite clergyman 
sources close to the israelibacked south lebanon army said 
militia chief antoine lahad would decide on tuesday whether to free 
some of his 300 prisoners for id al fitr the moslem holiday 
marking the end of the ramadan fast 
proiranian radicals holding 17 western hostages and three 
israeli soldiers in lebanon could interpret the release of the 
mostly shiite moslem inmates from the al khiam prison just north of 
israels border as a goodwill gesture 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was 
a tradition of freeing prisoners during the holiday but they said 
any release would be up to lahad and unconnected with the issue of 
western hostages 
earlier in the day israel radio quoted the south lebanon army 
as saying it had no intention of freeing shiite prisoners in

us hostage robert polhill 55 an educator held for 1182 days 
was set free sunday

of shiite moslem cleric sheik abdul karim obeid who was abducted 
by israeli troops in lebanon in july 
the tehran times an englishlanguage daily close to president

prisoners impeded efforts to free western hostages israeli army 
spokesmen and other officials gave no indication that israel 
planned to free obeid

israel was making efforts to free its own soldiers held captive in 
lebanon

the supreme court on monday kept alive a 
lawsuit in which a california man seeks parental rights to a child 
he fathered by artificial insemination 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by the mother 
linden crouch of oregon who says she never agreed to share 
parental rights with sperm donor kevin mcintyre 
the justices refused to block a trial in which mcintyre hopes to 
prove he donated sperm only after ms crouch said she would let him 
help raise the child 
ms crouchs appeal said mcintyre has no constitutional right to 
share in rearing the child now 3 mr mcintyres claim at the 
most and if proven is that he has lost a quantity of sperm because 
he was tricked by ms crouch the appeal said 
in other action the high court 
refused to give new life to a copyright lawsuit over actress 
shirley maclaines 1983 bestselling book out on a limb the 
court let stand rulings that maclaines book on reincarnation did 
not infringe the copyright of a 1977 book written by charles silva 
raised the possibility an amish sect in minnesota may be forced 
to display a slowmoving vehicle warning on the back of its 
horsedrawn buggies the justices ordered the minnesota supreme 
court to restudy its ruling exempting the amish from the traffic 
warning emblems 
refused to reinstate the california murder conviction of black 
panther johnny spain who was shackled during his 17month trial a 
lower court overturned the conviction on the ground the shackling 
violated his rights 
agreed to use the case of a mississippi death row inmate to 
provide new guidelines for police questioning of suspects the 
convicted murderer said his confession should not have been 
admitted as evidence because he was denied his right to have a 
lawyer present 
rejected an appeal by a former member of the church of 
scientology of california who wanted the church declared a phony 
religion still pending before the justices is the churchs appeal 
to overturn a 25 million emotional distress award won by the 
former member 
rejected a chemical companys challenge to federal standards 
for clean water the court left intact rules that govern more than 
1000 factories producing organic chemicals plastics and synthetic 
fibers 
the justices were told in the sperm donor case that more than 
20000 children are born each year through artificial insemination 
in most cases sperm banks are used and the donors and the women 
are unknown to each other 
but mcintyre from moraga calif has known ms crouch from 
ashland ore for 13 years 
ms crouch gave birth to a daughter glenellen susan on nov 
24 1986 after being artificially impregnated with sperm she had 
asked mcintyre to donate 
he said he agreed to the arrangement only after ms crouch told 
him she wanted him to share parenting with her and would let him 
have visitation rights 
oregons artificial insemination law denies any parental rights 
to a sperm donor unless he is married to the recipient 
a state trial judge threw out mcintyres lawsuit seeking 
parental rights 
but a state appeals court by a 21 vote reinstated his suit in 
1988 the appeals court said the state law violated mcintyres 
constitutionally protected dueprocess rights 
the appeals court said mcintyre is entitled to a trial in 
jackson county ore on his allegation that ms crouch broke an 
oral agreement 
this was conduct between private parties ms crouchs 
appeal to the supreme court said the government was not involved 
so a liberty interest under the constitutions due process 
clause does not exist 
ms crouchs appeal said the appeals court ruling calls into 
question the legal relationships among donors fathers and children 
conceived by artificial insemination in oregon 
most states have artificial insemination laws her appeal said 
mcintyre in urging the justices to reject ms crouchs appeal 
said he has tried since 1980 to adopt a child and since 1983 has 
sought to have a child through a surrogate mother

its after dark and car service driver ronnie 
ramchand is answering a call in the bronx the address is on a dark 
street and the caller turns out to be a teenager carrying a 
baseball bat 
should i or shouldnt i ramchand wonders scrutinizing the 
young man 
if he guesses wrong it could be deadly 
a bronx cab driver found sunday with a bullet in the back of his 
head was the sixth hired driver to die in that borough in six 
weeks another was found dead saturday in brooklyn police believe 
robbery was the motive 
this time ramchand guesses right he gave the teenager a ride 
and lived to tell about it 
im taking precautions he says im not picking up 
anybody i dont like the looks of 
mayor david dinkins has ordered undercover police officers to 
drive cabs in hope of catching the killer or killers soon they 
may become the only nighttime cab drivers in the bronx scores 
have quit driving after dark 
why should i asked carlos rosado a driver for parkway car 
service its crazy im only 20 im not going to lose my life 
no way 
but thats why ramchand who had been driving for a living for 
two months works nights so many night drivers have quit that 
ramchand who normally works days is driving well into the night 
to help express taxi service with its driver shortage 
three of the shootings have been linked through ballistic tests 
to the same 22caliber gun those three victims had been called to 
pick up passengers late at night at addresses within a mile of each 
other in the bronx 
ramchand admits theres little he can do to protect himself 
unlike many other drivers he doesnt even carry a crowbar as a 
weapon 
passengers sit right behind you ramchand said you cant 
see them youre not going to know if theyre going to hit you 
conventional medallion cabs which are allowed to pick up 
passengers who hail them on the street often have bulletresistant 
partitions between the driver and passengers 
but the vehicles used by car services often are ramshackle and 
have no such partitions the citys car services respond to 
telephone calls and may not pick up passengers who hail them on the 
street 
in new yorks outer boroughs medallion cabs are hard to find 
they make more money picking up fares in busy manhattan 
some of the upscale chauffeur services accept vouchers reducing 
the amount of cash a driver carries but some like ramchands 
take only cash making them moving targets for robbers 
he says he will not pick up a fare that doesnt feel right 
that teenager with the baseball bat called from a section of 
street where the lights were not working ramchand went to the 
address and blew his horn and the young man walked toward him 
ramchand looked carefully he noticed the bat was accompanied by a 
glove and the sweat and dirt on the youths baseball clothes 
as long as im careful ill be ok im not scared but my wife 
is ramchand said 
elsewhere in the bronx driver william barnwell was less 
sanguine one of his cousins was among the slain drivers 
what can i say im scared to death barnwell said 
ive been robbed ive been beaten up ive had my tooth 
caps knocked out i got 14 stitches in my head last year and now 
this guy not only wants your money he wants to kill you he said 
barnwell who works days says he has been robbed so often that 
other drivers tease him 
that last guy he didnt even say stick em up barnwell 
recalled man ive never seen so many guns pointed at me since i 
took this job 
the attacks have taught him what kind of fare to avoid the 
tipoff is when somebody late at night wants to go only a short 
distance dont pick those calls up he said

energy secretary james watkins unleashed a 
scathing attack monday on the northeast saying the regions 
continued opposition to pipelines refineries and nuclear plants 
likely will cause repeats of last winters heating oil crisis 
the northeast has not participated in the agony in 
balancing their desires for a pristine environment with assuring a 
secure and adequate supply of energy watkins told a house energy 
subcommittee 
a national energy strategy being prepared for president bush 
will emphasize the northeasts greater reluctance than other 
regions to supply its own energy needs he said 
i dont see anybody clamoring for a reduced standard of 
living watkins told the three members of the energy panels 
oversight and investigations subcommitee present at the hearing 
but if you dont so some of these things then youre going to 
have to face the consequences 
for example he said 11 refineries with a combined production 
capacity of 25 million barrels a day have been rejected over the 
past two decades for environmental reasons by state and local 
governments in the region 
if some of these refineries had been built the additional 
capacity might have helped to alleviate last winters supply 
problems in the northeast he said 
watkins said the proposed energy strategy to be submitted to 
bush in december will seek to level the playing field and 
present options to eliminate obstacles to moving toward an energy 
policy that better balances costs among regions of the country

federal safety investigators concluded monday 
that an improperly latched cargo door popped open before a cargo 
plane crashed in texas last year but said they could not determine 
the cause of the crash 
the accident at carswell air force base near fort worth killed 
the pilot and copilot who were the only people aboard the dc9 
operated by evergreen international airlines 
the national transportation safety board after a meeting on the 
march 18 1989 crash said inadequate procedures used by evergreen 
for preflight verification of cargo door security contributed to 
the crash 
the board also blamed the federal aviation administration for 
approving procedures used for verification of cargo door security 
and for failing to order modifications to the open door warning 
system on dc9s used as cargo planes 
mcdonnell douglas was cited for failing to provide the flight 
crew guidance on inflight opening of the cargo door despite 23 
previous incidents involving dc9s and dc8s none of the previous 
incidents resulted in an accident 
the board said klm which owned the aircraft before evergreen 
accomplished only three of the 11 items the manufacturer 
recommended for the main cargo door and evergreen took no 
additional action on the items 
all faaordered actions were taken however investigators said 
the board said the flights copilot probably failed to complete 
the door locking cycle and the captain was not aware of it because 
of the malfunctioning warning system the door opened upon takeoff 
investigators concluded 
the opening of a cargo door could disturb the stability of an 
airliner affecting airspeed and altitude the board said in 
recommending that mcdonnell douglas amend its operating manual to 
include information about the effects of an open cargo door on 
flight 
the plane crashed during a turn as it was preparing to land

million and from taiwan 4855 million 
the departments finding was preliminary a final determination

federal health officials monday called 
experiments involving animals the linchpin of medical advances and 
said animal rights activists threaten to derail this progress 
animal studies have been and continue to be an 
indispensable part of the great biomedical revolution that has 
brought freedom from disease and suffering to millions of human 
beings said constance horner under secretary of health and 
human services 
virtually every major medical advance of the last hundred 
years has involved such studies the development of vaccines for 
polio tetanus diphtheria and whooping cough insulin for 
diabetics radiation and chemotherapy for cancer patients organ 
transplants and antibiotics 
in a pep talk to scientists at the national institutes of health 
in bethesda md the day before a planned animalrights rally 
there horner condemned the activities of extremists who are 
cultivating a climate of fear throughout the scientific 
research community 
scientists are being intimidated and threatened and their 
experiments sabotaged she said 
we must not permit the activities of a handful of extremists 
to deprive millions of lifesustaining and lifeenhancing fruits of 
biomedical research she said in prepared remarks 
horner said scientists including those at nih have long 
discouraged and condemned animal research that is unnecessary or 
cruel 
dr frederick goodwin head of the alcohol drug abuse and 
mental health administration told reporters earlier that both nih 
and his agency conduct research under the regulations of the animal 
welfare act of 1966 
in many cases its easier to do research with humans than 
with animals he said 
animal rights activists planned a demonstration at nih on 
tuesday to protest the use of animals in addiction research 
friends of animals which is sponsoring the protest says too 
much is being spent on animal experimentation at the expense of 
treatment and prevention of drug addiction 
the group contends scientists search for a cure for addiction 
is fruitless and fails to address the underlying social and 
psychological causes of addiction 
goodwin said the federal government is spending about 1 million 
this year and hopes to increase that to 20 million next year on 
various efforts to educate the public especially the young about 
the life sciences 
he said that was necessary in part to counter the efforts of 
animal rights activists who he said use americans lack of science 
knowledge to confuse the public 
people for the ethical treatment of animals characterized the 
effort as indoctrinating children with the idea that animals are 
no more than test tubes with whiskers

a teary marilyn quayle told a congressional 
panel monday that her mother might have been spared a painful death 
from breast cancer had the disease been detected at an early stage 
mrs quayle making her first appearance on capitol hill since 
her husband dan quayle became vice president in january 1989 
recounted her mothers death at age 56 her voice cracked with 
emotion 
we meet this morning to declare war on breast cancer a 
war in which there can be no substitute for victory mrs quayle 
said before the house subcommittee on health and environment 
the 40yearold mrs quayle who has traveled the country urging 
women over age 35 to have mammograms recalled what happened when 
her mother a pediatrician in indiana found a lump in her breast 
her own physician told her not to worry he had seen many 
lumps in the past he was fairly certain this one was benign 
mrs quayle said of her mother the late mary tucker 
within six months however the lump had grown and the cancer 
had spread to mrs tuckers lymphatic system after debilitating 
breast surgery and painful chemotherapy mrs tucker died in 1975 
mary tuckers story does not have to be repeated mrs 
quayle said mammography and selfexamination could have kept her 
alive early detection could have given my mother less severe 
surgical options it could have slowed the spread of the disease 
while mrs quayle has promoted the need for mammograms she did 
not endorse legislation that would finance screening for lowincome 
women for breast and cervical cancer 
the legislation sponsored by reps henry waxman dcalif the 
panels chairman and edward madigan rill is expected if 
passed to cost 50 million in fiscal year 1991 
madigan asked mrs quayle if she could persuade the bush 
administration to back the measure instead she dwelt on the fear 
that keeps some women for having the xrays 
fear is what we are fighting she said fear the greatest 
obstacle to early detection and treatment fear of the unknown 
fear of what might turn up on the xray 
she also said that women dont take care of themselves and 
urged men to be more aggressive in encouraging the women in their 
lives to have breast cancer examinations 
noting that women frequently are the ones who hound husbands and 
children on health care she said its time for the men in our 
lives to hound us 
also testifying was rep barbara vucanovich rnev who said no 
doctor ever mentioned to her the need for a mammogram until she was 
61 her first examination detected a tumor 
early detection of my breast cancer allowed me to go on to 
live an active and satisfying life and caused me to dedicate 
myself to reducing breast cancer she said

a centerright coalition claimed 
victory monday in multiparty parliamentary elections in croatia 
while a reform communist won the runoff presidential election in 
neighboring slovenia 
the elections in the two republics were considered crucial for 
the future of yugoslavia a loose federation of six republics and 
two provinces there were fears the voting could further divide the 
country 
slovenia and croatia have taken the lead in holding the first 
free multiparty elections in yugoslavia in almost 50 years nearly 
4 million voters went to the polls in the two northern republics on 
sunday 
but serbia the largest republic and only one of two still led 
by hardline communists has accused some slovene and croatian 
leaders of advocating secession from the balkan nation of 23 
million 
in slovenia with nearly all the 12 million ballots counted 
communist reformer milan kucan had 5839 of the vote after sundays 
secondround presidential balloting 
joze pucnik leader of the centerright demos coalition trailed 
with 416 percent of the vote and conceded the election 
kucan formerly headed the slovene communist party renamed the 
party of democratic reform which has insisted that slovenia remain 
part of a reconstructed yugoslav federation pucnik advocated 
slovenias secession from yugoslavia 
kucan thus becomes eastern europes first freely elected 
communist head of state since a democratic upheaval swept the 
region last year 
we should now heal the rifts of a very divisive campaign by 
uniting for the sake of slovenia kucan said in a television 
interview monday 
kucan 49 said he had turned in his party membership card for 
the duration of his fouryear term of office in a goodwill gesture 
toward his opponents 
i want to be the president of all citizens of slovenia 
kucan said 
despite kucans victory his party was soundly defeated in the 
april 8 parliamentary elections 
he will have to work with a government chosen by pucniks demos 
coalition which is expected to form the first noncommunist 
government in any of yugoslavias republics in 45 years the 
centerright coalition won 55 percent of the seats in slovenias 
regional parliament 
in croatia the second largest republic a leader of the 
croatian democratic union a centerright coalition claimed 
victory in the republics parliamentary elections 
neven jurica a coalition leader said the union had won an 
impressive victory and was expected to take an outright 
majority of seats in the elections firstround 
jurica said the coalitions first task would be to change 
croatias communist constitution into a westernstyle charter 
voters chose among 30 parties to fill 356 seats in the 
threechamber parliament 
with nearly onethird of the votes in 106 constituencies 
counted the unions candidates were leading in 60 of them the 
reform communist party in 38 and the centrist coalition of

washington no deals is the word from george bush but one 
deal is held out that clearly interests iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani release of american hostages would lead to dramatically 
improved relations between the united states and iran 
the same offer applies to syria the other key government with 
the ability to influence the hostage situation 
the release of an american in lebanon this time it was robert 
polhill always sets analysts scrambling to determine if something 
has changed if there is reason to hope that the ordeal of the 
remaining hostages might soon end 
the hope this time is that iran and syria might be seeing 
release of the hostages as the price they must pay for improved 
relations 
that would be the reverse of irans stance last summer when the 
demand was that the united states make the first move 
i have said many times that if the united states expects us to 
help in the lebanese issue it should show in practice that it has 
dropped its hostile stand against us rafsanjani said then 
has there been a significant change as usual in the middle 
east who knows 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on the middle east said the release of polhill made 
it appropriate for the united states to send some kind of a 
gesture that were willing to enter into a dialogue with iran 
there are a lot of things that could be done here short of 
aid short of normalization short of credits that might be a 
gesture in response to the release of a hostage he said on cbs 
face the nation 
but the response from the white house was to maintain a tough 
line 
as the president said yesterday we want the release of all 
hostages that would open the door towards better relations with 
iran said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
bush had to admit on sunday that he couldnt say what irans 
role had been in gaining polhills release 
i cant tell you i honestly know said the president 
american analysts cite iran and syria as the two countries with 
obvious influence on the groups that are holding 17 westerners 
including seven americans in lebanon 
but can a one quick command from tehran or damascus bring 
freedom for the hostages 
that doesnt seem likely 
richard murphy assistant secretary of state for the near east 
during the reagan administration pointed out on nbcs meet the 
press that there are no clear lines of authority within 
hezbollah the organization that includes the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine which was holding three americans 
including polhill 
gary sick a national security council aide when jimmy carter 
was president appeared on the same program as murphy the show 
aired before polhills release and the two men were speculating 
about the reasons for the delay word was circulated last week that 
one of american hostages would be freed on friday but then the 
release was abruptly postponed 
sick speculated that the delay might be simply a demonstration 
of a long negotiating process that this is not going to be easy 
and that if the west wants to get their hostages out theyre going 
to have to provide some concessions to iran

president bush sought to unravel a white house 
mystery monday what bit presidential pooch millie on the nose 
bush returning from a midday speech stepped from his 
limousine conferred with national park service groundskeepers and 
then led them on a search of an ivycovered hill 50 yards from the 
mansion 
they poked around the knoll for a few minutes before bush headed 
for the oval office 
reporters watching from afar clamored for an explanation 
the president assuming an air of mock gravity responded 
theres a very serious problem when i get ready to announce 
what i was doing ill let you know it was very serious stuff 
then he was ready 
millie got bit on the nose by some animal he added 
theres a big hole over there 
millie an english springer spaniel had the encounter friday 
and still had scabs on her nose a press aide to first lady barbara 
bush said later monday 
mrs bush is speculating it was something big millie had her 
nose where it shouldnt have been and she got bit said aide jean 
becker 
millies nose swelled up after the incident but the swelling 
went down by evening and she required no treatment ms becker 
added 
millie went to camp david later friday for the weekend with her 
mistress 
it was anybodys guess whether millie suffered this comeuppance 
from a groundhog or some other lowlying lawn beast 
bush has boasted of millies hunting prowess the springer 
spaniel has recorded almost a dozen known kills of squirrels 
rabbits and at least one rat

an international group of museum directors on 
monday pledged financial support to an art gallery facing obscenity 
charges for displaying robert mapplethorpes sexually explicit 
photographs 
trustees of the association of art museum directors came to 
cincinnati from across the country and canada to show their support 
for the contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie 
the gallery and barrie were indicted april 7 on misdemeanor 
obscenity charges for displaying the seven disputed photos in the 
175picture collection by the late mapplethorpe some of the photos 
in the show which angered sen jesse helms and prompted debate 
about federal funding for the arts depict naked children or 
homosexual acts 
the new yorkbased association represents directors of 153 
museums in the united states and canada 
john walsh the associations president and director of the j 
paul getty museum in los angeles said the charges are an attack on 
constitutionally protected freedom of expression 
if a prosecutor here can use indictments police actions and 
confiscation to intimidate an art exhibit then other prosecutors 
may be tempted walsh told a news conference at the gallery we 
see something sinister here if dennis is under indictment we 
think were all under indictment 
none of the photos was confiscated but patrons were cleared 
from the cincinnati show for a time on its opening day while 
authorities videotaped the exhibit 
the museum association criticized cincinnati prosecutors and 
those those who supported them 
this is the tip of the iceberg said marc wilson the 
associations second vice president and director of the 
nelsonatkins museum of art in kansas city mo the question is 
is one group with the set of values of this group allowed to 
define what the majority should see its not just about art 
its about your right to do a lot of things 
the association said it would pay any fine that barrie the art 
gallery and its trustees might incur it also promised to help 
defray defense costs and to provide witnesses and testimony if 
there is a trial 
hamilton county municipal judge david albanese has scheduled a 
pretrial meeting with the lawyers april 30 barrie and lawyers for 
the center have pleaded innocent 
barrie said the art centers legal costs are in the tens of 
thousands of dollars 
karl kadon an assistant city prosecutor overseeing the 
prosecution declined comment monday 
the exhibit has attracted more than 35000 people since it 
opened april 7 spokeswoman amy banister said 
the 50yearold arts centers previous record attendance for any 
exhibit was 29000 for the sixweek computers and art show in 
late 1987 
the mapplethorpe show titled the perfect moment continues 
to be shown in its entirety at the art gallery the center obtained 
an april 8 order from us district judge carl rubin protecting the

a top contra leader in nicaragua says 
rebel troops he commands will not disarm until the sandinista army 
disappears regardless of a demobilization accord with the 
governmentelect 
the causes for our fight will have been fulfilled once the eps 
sandinista army and the interior ministry internal security 
forces disappear dennis galeano known as commander johnny 
told the associated press in an interview sunday 
representatives of the usbacked rebels signed accords with 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorros united national 
opposition on april 19 agreeing to move into rural security zones 
and disarm by june 10 6 weeks after mrs chamorro takes office on 
wednesday 
although contra negotiators said the agreement was 
unconditional they were clearly aware that the sandinistas agreed 
to depoliticize the army and forbid officers to serve in party 
posts the sandinista party now controls the army 
what has been signed is in exchange for something that will 
happen if everything goes according to plan we will disarm 
said galeano the brother of contra chiefofstaff israel galeano 
known as commander franklin 
dennis galeano reported had more than 2000 guerrillas under his 
command and said they will move into security zones designed to 
keep the sandinista army and contras apart as called for in the 
accords 
but differences of interpretation and suspicion of each others 
intentions after nine years of civil war may cause hangups on 
demobilization the sandinistas note the government agreed to 
respect the integrity and professionalism of the sandinista 
peoples army interpreting this to mean the military command will 
be left intact 
contras in the field however said the current command 
structure could not be retained 
this is the voice of the people they didnt vote for a 
partial change they voted for a total change said osvaldo 
galeano another galeano brother and battalion commander known as 
el negro 
dennis galeano said the sandinista military must understand 
that political power is the essential element to maintaining an 
army and they lost the elections 
the ap encountered dennis and osvaldo galeano and about 100 
other contras in this hamlet of a dozen wooden houses on a prairie 
they were talking with about 300 peasants from around el guau in 
central chontales province about 100 miles east of managua 
i dont think the resistance should disarm said santiago 
diaz a 65yearold peasant referring to the contras by their 
formal name 
before the elections the sandinistas told us that if we voted 
for uno they would present us with the bill he said using a 
nicaraguan phrase that can be interpreted as a threat 
well we voted for uno and now if they sandinistas stay in 
place well all be dead youll see 
another peasant candelario benito vargas 60 said we want 
the army to leave and the resistance to become our army thats 
what we want 
if you never lived under the repression of the sandinistas 
you dont know what it was like vargas said we want those 
piricuacos an indian word meaning dogs to disappear 
both dennis and osvaldo galeano hinted the contras themselves 
might replace purged sandinista officers 
that would be the peoples decision if they ask us to replace 
the officers then we would dennis galeano said 
the sandinistas have repeatedly said they will not accept the 
contras as a new nicaraguan army saying such a move would be 
tantamount to bringing back the hated national guard of the late 
rightwing dictator anastasio somoza whom the sandinistas 
overthrew in 1979 
outgoing president daniel ortega said last week the main task of 
all sandinistas was to ensure the contras kept to their 
demobilization pact 
asked about the possibility of a renewed war as a result of a 
deadlock with the sandinistas dennis galeano said 
well see what happens after the new government reaches power 
i dont think open war is possible but well see how dona violeta 
acts and according to that we may be satisfied

a key prosecution witness in the slaying of a 
black teenager by a gang of whites last summer testified monday 
that one of the youths standing trial for murder boasted of having 
guns shortly before the killing 
gina feliciano whom defense lawyers say was the spark that led 
to the slaying of yusef hawkins 16 on aug 23 1989 said she 
heard keith mondello talk about weapons on the street below her 
apartment hours before the attack 
keith was saying he had five guns altogether three 38s and 
two 45s or three 45s and two 38s miss feliciano told the jury 
in brooklyns state supreme court 
she said mondello then bragged that he cant wait for 
tonight 
mondello and another white defendant joseph fama both 19 are 
charged with two counts of seconddegree murder and other crimes 
if convicted they face up to 25 years to life 
prosecutors say fama was the gunman who fatally shot hawkins and 
mondello organized the mob that attacked the black teens 
defense lawyers say the white youths gathered in front of miss 
felicianos apartment because they believed she had invited black 
and hispanic friends whom they considered outsiders and 
troublemakers to her 18th birthday party 
the youths from the mostly white neighborhood of bensonhurst in 
brooklyn were armed with baseball bats to protect themselves the 
lawyers maintain 
a sobbing miss feliciano testified that she later was looking 
out a bedroom window shortly after 9 pm when she saw hawkins and 
three other blacks walking along the street the four were in the 
neighborhood to look at a used car and did not know miss feliciano 
she testified that she heard mondello use a racial epithet to 
describe hawkins and his companions 
hawkins and his friends were followed by the whites many 
carrying bats and guns she said she said mondello and two other 
whites charged in the attack james patino and joseph serrano were 
in the gang 
they all had guns she said of the three young men 
how do you know they were guns asked justice thaddeus 
owens the trial judge 
cause i seen them miss feliciano replied 
she said she heard several shots and the whites scattered

survivors of 28 workers killed when an 
apartment building collapsed during construction three years ago 
monday say the debrisstrewn vacant lot at the site is a painful 
reminder of the tragedy 
on the anniversary city officials unveiled plans to erect an 
apartment building on the site of the lambiance plaza complex 
where 11 stories of concrete collapsed on the workers 
politicians and friends and relatives of the victims gathered 
monday a halfmile from the site to place flowers on a stone 
memorial offer words to the victims families and announce plans 
for the fivestory housing complex to be called renaissance plaza 
construction of the apartment complex is the final piece in the 
41 million settlement reached in december 1988 between the 
survivors and the projects developers 
under the settlement ownership of the land and anything built 
on it is transferred from the developers to the victims families 
said richard a bieder the attorney who represented the families 
in a class action lawsuit 
the building will consist of 60 to 80 apartments for low and 
middleincome tenants 
federal investigators blamed the collapse on the failure of a 
hydraulic jack used to lift floor slabs into place in a building 
technique known as liftslab construction the jacks failure 
created a chain reaction that brought down the entire building 
it was a terrible terrible sight and it was a scary scary 
sight with all the rubble down on everybody recalled frank j 
carroll jr president of the bridgeport building trades who 
helped with rescue efforts 
rescue workers dug through the rubble for nine days but only 
found one survivor 
that gave us some kind of hope that we would be fortunate 
enough to get more he said unfortunately that was not the 
case 
the new 9 million building is being built by two hartford 
developers who are putting up 34 million the rest will be 
financed by the connecticut housing finance authority and the state 
department of housing 
groundbreaking is expected this summer 
its nice to see them get rid of the rubble but i would have 
liked to have seen a park said david schneider whose uncle 
mario colello was among the victims 
others especially construction workers who attended mondays 
service said they will be glad to see a building rise from the 
rubble 
the scars are really too ugly said bridgeport electrician 
dave henshaw who lost a friend in the disaster and searched for 
others in the rubble you dont need to drive by on an almost 
daily basis and see the twisted metal and concrete 
but construction workers are less satisfied with efforts to 
improve job safety 
congress has still not enacted legislation pushed by sen 
christopher j dodd dconn and rep christopher shays rconn 
to improve safety requirements and give more authority to the 
federal occupational safety and health administration 
during the memorial service osha head gerard f scannell said 
he had been able to enact a number of administrative changes such 
as a new office within osha that will concentrate on reducing 
construction hazards and responding to emergencies 
he also said new standards would take effect this summer 
governing the liftslab construction like that used at lambiance 
our resolve must be that another lambiance plaza disaster 
will never again happen in america he said

president gerald r ford in 1975 secretly 
promised israel that the united states would seriously consider 
backing israels retention of territory on the golan heights 
captured from syria according to a report by an israeli think tank 
the territory had been used before the 1967 six day war for arab 
attacks on villages in northern israel it has served since then as 
a security buffer for the jewish state but syria is demanding its 
return 
ford in a letter to prime minister yitzhak rabin said the 
united states had not decided what position to take on the borders 
between israel and its arab neighbors including syria 
should it do so ford wrote sept 1 it will give great 
weight to israels position that any peace agreement with syria 
must be predicated on israel remaining on the golan heights 
at the time israel had agreed to relinquish key positions in 
the sinai desert to egypt 
in his letter ford called the withdrawal arranged through 
shuttlediplomacy by secretary of state henry a kissinger an 
act of great significance 
ford promised to maintain israels defensive strength through 
the supply of advanced f16 jet aircraft he also promised that 
the us will support the position that an overall settlement 
with syria in the framework fo a peace agreement must assure 
israels security from attack from the golan heights 
the letter which had been classified secret was published by 
the institute for advanced strategic and political studies of 
jerusalem in a report titled can israel survive a palestinian 
state 
i think its authentic said an official who served in the 
ford administration and was involved in mideast diplomacy it 
refers to a conversation ford had with rabin in the oval office 
the assurance probably was not as categorical as the israelis 
would have liked said the exofficial insisting on anonymity 
it sympathizes with the israeli position without binding us to it 
fully and without prejudging the outcome 
the main conclusion of the study was that establishment of a 
palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza territories also 
captured by israel in the 1967 war would pose a danger to the 
jewish state 
a palestinian arab state west of the jordan river would not 
bring a stable middle east peace the report said rather it 
would likely lead to chronic regional instability ending in a 
general arabisraeli war 
an independent palestinian state would be run by the palestine 
liberation organization the report said it would be a 
springboard for surrounding hostile states 
the report was to be made public at a news conference here 
tuesday it was sponsored by the simon wiesenthal center of los 
angeles 
israel returned part of the golan heights to syria in 1974 in an 
agreement mediated by kissinger israel subsequently extended its 
legal authority a step short of annexation to the rest of the 
territory 
the bush administration has taken the position that israel 
should relinquish occupied territory on all fronts the west bank 
gaza and the golan heights however us officials have not 
specified if that means all the land lost by the arabs in the 1967 
war should be returned 
the report stressed the importance of the west bank as a 
natural tank trap saying control of the region would enable 
israel to repel a coalition of arab armies that hold a manpower 
advantage

a new budgetcutting package in the house is 
putting a further squeeze on farm bill costs agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said monday 
the package announced last week by rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee would hold agriculture 
department spending on farm income support under federal commodity 
programs to 98 billion in the fiscal year that will begin on oct 
1 he said 
an administration budget plan sent to congress in january called 
for 102 billion a reduction of 15 billion from the increase 
that normally would occur if annual baseline spending trends 
were followed 
yeutter told a meeting of the national association of 
agricultural journalists that the administration and he in 
particular had come in for severe partisan criticism for the 
proposed 15 billion spending reduction 
the budget figures by panetta will be even harder for house 
agriculture committee leadership to reckon with because those 
amount to a 19 billion cut from the baseline he said 
we now have a much different situation in farm legislation 
than we did a few days ago yeutter said 
however the situation also depends on whose baseline is being 
used the current usda baseline is 117 billion which was based 
on crop indications last fall thus a 15 billion reduction would 
be required to needed to lower fiscal 1991 spending to the 102 
billion cited by yeutter as the bush proposal 
the panetta figure of 98 billion was derived from a 
congressional budget office baseline of 106 billion computed as 
of february 
under that computation the panetta budget reduction would be 
only 800 million not the 19 billion yeutter said 
regardless of whose figures are used farm commodity programs 
are in for some more paring and yeutter made the point that it 
will be even more urgent for the united states to seek a favorable 
conclusion to the uruguay round negotiations under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
the gatt talks scheduled to conclude at the end of this year 
are aimed a liberalizing world trade 
the us position on agricultural trade calls for the gradual 
elimination of all tradedistorting policies and subsidies over a 
period of years 
yeutter said there is a feeling in some us agricultural 
circles that the gatt talks are being overemphasized and that 
farmers would be better off relying on congress to write generous 
price and income support provisions in the new farm bill 
but there will not be a lucrative price package in the farm 
bill yeutter said therefore farmers will have to generate more 
of their income from the marketplace 
were simply not going to have the flow of federal tax dollars 
into agriculture in the coming year that weve had in the past 
he said 
yeutter said a twoprice dairy plan approved last week by a 
house agriculture subcommittee has some very negative features 
and would put a heavier cost burden on consumers 
members of the house wheat soybeans and feed grains 
subcommittee also faced grim financial reality last week when 
panetta announced the budget figures 
the lawmakers plans for price supports would cost 16 billion 
more over the fiveyear life of the bill than the budget would 
allow committee staff said 
the sections of the farm bill dealing with those commodities 
were put on hold until this thursday while the lawmakers find 
places to cut

the vanities blazed in the bronx on monday and 
courthouse regular ed mccarthy was steamed its total chaos 
he barked relating in detail his failed search for a parking spot 
maybe the book was right 
the book is the bonfire of the vanities tom wolfes 
bestselling story of avarice ego and corruption in new york and 
the chaos was occasioned by the arrival of onlocation filming for 
the movie 
there was a 200member film crew there were stars people such 
as tom hanks and bruce willis there was a simulated subway stop 
there were two 100foot cranes to spray simulated rain there were 
hundreds of onlookers 
and naturally there was a traffic jam 
they had to pick a monday they couldnt do it on the 
weekend groused mccarthy veteran spokesman of the district 
attorneys office so now im parked at a bus stop where some 
idiot will give me a ticket and ill have to go downtown to get it 
fixed 
mccarthy was joking about the ticket but not about the rest 
and he wasnt alone its making everybodys life miserable 
said nick kavalos owner of a delicatessen across the street the 
bread guy had to park two blocks away and carry in my delivery 
others took a more benign view of the proceedings which focused 
on a corner outside the mario merola building housing the bronx 
county courthouse about 200 people watched obligingly hushing 
during takes then resuming their chatterpunctuated gawking at the 
stars 
in manhattan you see it all the time not in the bronx 
said max gottlieb a jeweler and aspiring screenwriter who had 
traveled from his manhattan office to watch up here its a 
major event 
so far ive seen only tom hanks said elba vargas smiling 
in the sun with her yearold daughter christine also geraldo 
she appended meaning television personality geraldo rivera who 
had a 12word part 
its pretty good for the bronx this area is still in a 
rebuilding stage and to have something like this here its a boost 
to the economy said ron romano a clerk in the courthouse 
its a morale boost too 
the economic benefit garnered some debate the city says feature 
film producers spend roughly 100000 per day locally when shooting 
here and the bonfire filming may take five weeks 
but kavalos of the court deli noted with resignation that the 
crews meals were catered elsewhere look around you dont see 
nobody said one of his waitresses chris ripkin all we get is 
bathroom customers 
there was a more serious economic issue as well its fantasy 
land thats what it is said the rev james mcclain who passed 
by the crowd and kept on his way they spend 30 million or 40 
million for a picture and theres people here who cant afford to 
feed their children 
an equally harsh reality showed its face three blocks from the 
filming just before noon the driver of a van fired a gunshot 
tried to run over a police officer and then sped off authorities 
said 
no one was hurt and the only disruption at the movie site was a 
single police car that whizzed past with sirens blaring 
said kavalos were in a bad neighborhood here 
that is not the message the leaders of the bronx wish to send 
out and they eyed the moviemaking warily theyre in here to 
make money but i dont think theyre in here to take advantage of 
the people of the bronx said clint roswell spokesman for 
borough president fernando ferrer theyve certainly expressed a 
willingness not to do broad smear 
one sign of good will plans to decorate the recently cleaned 
courthouse with ersatz graffiti were dropped i can definitely 
confirm that there is no fake graffiti said rob harris 
spokesman for the distributor warner bros 
harris said little else averring that warner had made a 
marketing decision not to encourage media coverage of the movie 
just yet still some potential customers had already made up their 
minds 
am i going to go to the movie no said kavalos when they 
put it on tv maybe

diehard contra rebels an economy in 
such poor shape that it is not producing enough food for its people 
and opposition from the outgoing sandinistas are among the problems 
facing violeta barrio de chamorro when she takes office wednesday 
the effort to find solutions in central americas largest 
republic is made more difficult because her united national 
opposition is a 14party coalition that spans the political 
spectrum from communists to conservatives 
but mrs chamorro will be taking over following the mandate of 
free elections on feb 25 something rare in this tropical nation 
of 35 million residents nicaragua has been ruled by autocratic 
and oppressive governments much of the time since it gained 
independence in 1821 
its the beginning of democracy in nicaragua mrs chamorro 
said when she and vice presidentelect virgilio godoy were 
officially presented with their election certificate monday by the 
supreme electoral council 
nevertheless it will be a tough start for mrs chamorro 61 a 
newspaper publisher who has little political and no governmental 
experience she has been relying on a team of experienced advisers 
to develop economic plans and negotiate with fractious contras and 
sandinistas 
the contras are foremost among the problems her administration 
faces they have been fighting the sandinistas for nine years and 
dont want to demobilize as they promised to do so by june 10 
unless the army is purged of sandinista officers 
mrs chamorros team has agreed to respect the professional 
status of the sandinista army but forbid its officers to hold any 
positions in political parties 
some contras want their officers to replace sandinista officers 
something that could lead to conflict with stillmilitant 
sandinistas the army is under their political control and many 
party activists also have modern weapons 
mrs chamorro has repeatedly said nicaragua cannot support a big 
army anyway the economy hurt over the years by a nowended us 
embargo and ineffectual sandinista policies is in shambles 
inflation in 1988 hit 33600 percent until the sandinistas 
curbed spending and brought it down last year to 1800 percent 
even so the chamorro administration will have to do a lot of 
belttightening to bring it to acceptable levels 
they need to stabilize the currency attract foreign investment 
and bring back some of the money people stashed away abroad for 
safekeeping 
as it is nicaragua is saddled with a 7 billion foreign debt it 
can hardly meet payments on and that will need renegotiating with 
creditor banks 
president bush has asked for 300 million in immediate aid to 
help the chamorro administration through its first months in 
office but the us congress has been moving slowly and in any 
case the amount will not solve all problems 
we dont have anything but i have confidence in nicaraguans 
and in our friends from the exterior to reconstruct nicaragua 
she told journalists monday 
mrs chamorros financial adviser francisco mayorga says the 
new administration will not know until after the inauguration how 
much cash the treasury has government employees must be paid five 
days after she takes office 
even the number of government employees is unknown the 
sandinistas havent been giving out any figures although outgoing 
president daniel ortega talked in 1989 of having to fire 30000 
government employees as part of his austerity program 
for many years the government rationed gasoline to save on 
crude oil which the sandinistas imported from the soviet union via 
cuba venezuela and mexico cut off sales about three years ago 
because nicaragua was not paying even at belowmarket rates 
right now the country has two months reserves and cuba is 
cutting off sales meaning mrs chamorros administration will have 
to buy on the open market 
the sandinistas who got 40 percent of the vote in the february 
elections and are still the countrys biggest single political 
party have been distributing land titles and making other moves to 
entrench their reforms 
uno has also accused sandinista sympathizers of stripping 
government assets down to the office furniture 
but sandinista policies including price controls and limited 
investment hurt farm and livestock production in this largely 
agricultural nation a problem that will become another priority 
for mrs chamorros administration 
as recently as january the country had to import rice which 
it used to export and received a donated shiploand of beans from 
spain because it did not grow enough of these staples to feed the 
population

its unlikely that kimberly hardy a 
black welfare mother and lynn bremer a successful white attorney 
would ever have been thrown together if not for one thing they had 
in common cocaine addiction 
bremer joined hardy last week as two of the first women in 
michigan to be charged with delivering cocaine to their babies by 
allegedly using the drug just before giving birth 
the cases are drawing renewed attention not only to the practice 
of prosecuting drugaddicted mothers but also to the misconception 
that is it primarily the poor uneducated woman using drugs during 
pregnancy 
were finding that drug addiction during pregnancy is a 
problem that crosses all income and social levels particularly 
when it comes to cocaine said suzanne mieluken of the michigan 
department of public healths office of maternal and child health 
a study conducted last year in pinellas county fla found no 
substantial difference in the rate of substance abuse between 
pregnant women undergoing care in public clinics and more affluent 
women in private care according to the national association for 
perinatal addiction and research and education 
about 148 percent of all american babies born last year were 
exposed to controlled substances before birth the organization 
said 
there are 30 to 40 similar similar cases pending across the 
country 
think of how many cases of drugaddicted births there must be 
in detroit all over the state but women arent being prosecuted 
there said attorney alan rapoport of the american civil 
liberties union who represents bremer and hardy the only places 
where this is happening is the little jerkwater towns where the 
local prosecutor wants to make headlines 
on monday muskegon county circuit judge r max daniels denied a 
request by rapoport to dismiss the cocainedelivery charge against 
hardy however the judge did dismiss a less serious charge of 
seconddegree childabuse saying there was no evidence hardys 
cocaine use had caused her sons low birthweight and 
gastrointestinal problems 
the cocainedelivery charges carries a maximum penalty of 20 
years in prison seconddegree child abuse is punishable by a 
maximum of four years in pison 
muskegon county prosecutor tony tague says he is using the 
threat of prosecution to urge addicted mothers to seek treatment 
during pregnancy 
were trying to send a message that if you are a 
drugaddicted pregnant women and you seek meaningful treatment 
during your pregnancy you will not be prosecuted tague said he 
said if bremer had sought treatment during her pregnancy which her 
doctor had recommended she likely wouldnt be facing charges 
bremer 36 checked herself into a 30day drug treatment center 
april 15 five days after her daughter brittany was born at 
hackley hospital tests showed evidence of cocaine in the systems 
of both mother and daughter bremer was charged thursday but wont 
be arraigned until she is released from the center 
tague said bremer a general practice attorney since 1982 
admitted using cocaine throughout her pregnancy up until about 48 
hours before delivery police say hardy 22 admitted using crack 
cocaine about 13 hours before she gave birth in august she was 
charged in october and went into drug treatment which she has 
completed 
rapoport and many healthcare providers contend tagues approach 
will keep drugaddicted pregnant women out of prenatal programs for 
fear of prosecution 
tague contends that hardy and bremer passed cocaine to their 
babies through the umbilical cord seconds after the infant exited 
the birth canal and before the cord was cut under michigan law a 
woman cannot be charged with injuring or delivering anything to a 
fetus 
tague has said he wouldnt seek prison time for the women 
conviction on the 20year felony charge includes one year of 
mandatory imprisonment but the statute allows for a departure from 
the mandatory minimum if the court finds substantial and 
compelling reasons to do so 
the infants born to bremer and hardy appear healthy but 
research suggests babies exposed to cocaine while in the womb 
suffer from a distressing array of brain disorders and medical 
problems that appear to stunt their development for years if not 
permanently 
bremers daughter is in the custody of the state department of 
social services and was placed in a foster home tuesday hardys 
newborn son and other two children were taken from her and are 
living with her parents in mississippi both women are single

an ohio congressman said monday that hes not 
convinced the bush administration is putting enough emphasis on 
environmental protection in eastern europe as it rushes to help 
emerging democracies 
over the last few months we have been watching the iron 
curtain rise only to reveal a ruined landscape blanketed in 
devastating toxic industrial pollution said rep thomas luken 
democratic chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on transportation and hazardous materials 
but he said a turf war between the environmental protection 
agency and the agency for international development threatens the 
us environmental programs in eastern europe 
movement is afoot to hand over these us environmental 
programs to the agency for international development even though 
all the expertise is at epa luken said 
timothy atkeson who is in charge of international activities at 
epa said environmental experts will be working with eastern 
europeans though they may be private contractors hired through aid 
the president has asked for flexibility atkeson said at a 
hearing of lukens subcommittee 
some programs would be best addressed by the epa some by the 
department of energy and some the private sector through aid 
contracts atkeson said 
he said epa would be the lead agency 
but luken admonished 
in the rush to provide ecomomic assistance to these ruined 
nations it is imperative that we not commit the very mistakes that 
their own governments have made since the second world war by 
choosing development at the expense of the environment

turboprop passenger planes will have to have a 
groundproximity warning system under federal regulations announced 
monday 
the federal aviation administration said the rule which would 
become final after a period for public comment follows a study of 
accidents in which pilots have flown aircraft into the ground with 
no apparent awareness that they were about to crash 
of 41 such accidents from 1970 to 1988 twothirds could have 
been prevented with such a system the faa said the study was 
conducted by the transportation department on a recommendation from 
the national transportation safety board which investigates 
accidents 
a groundproximity warning system sounds an alarm when a plane 
that is not preparing to land goes below a set altitude if the 
aircraft has its flaps and wheels down for landing the alarm does 
not sound 
the faa said 695 turboprop aircraft would have to add the 
system which has been required on large jetliners since 1974 and 
on smaller jets since 1978 warning devices were not previously 
required for turboprops the faa said because it was believed at 
the time that they had a greater ability to respond quickly in 
situations where altitude control was inadvertently neglected

the drug enforcement administration said 
monday that the publication of the names of 49 dea agents in mexico 
by a mexican news magazine was an irresponsible act that could 
put them in danger 
the dea said in a statement that the agency is open about our 
presence in 46 countries but we do not publish the names or 
location of our personnel for obvious security reasons 
publication of the names of dea special agents and others 
by proceso was an irresponsible act that could potentially threaten 
the safety of these people dea said 
dea spokesman conn dougherty said the motivation behind this 
is still a mystery to us 
we dont think its any sort of retaliation at all for the 
arrest by dea agents of a guadalajara gynecologist on charges of 
participating in the 1985 murder of dea agent enrique camarena 
dougherty said 
dr humberto alvarez machain was taken by plane to el paso 
texas where he was arrested by dea agents an attorney for alvarez 
contends the doctor was abducted and taken to the border 
that arrest earlier this month sparked a diplomatic protest from 
mexico which demanded a full explanation from the us government 
attorney general dick thornburgh said a preliminary report of 
the arrest by dea indicates that no us agents were present when 
alvarez was captured and flown to el paso 
dougherty said he was unaware of any special security 
precautions that the dea agents in mexico were taking as a result 
of the publication of their names 
were very careful that our people in all the countries 
exercise proper precautions especially in countries where there may 
have been any kind of disturbance or incident in the past 
dougherty said

albanian authorities said monday they 
will allow the emigration of six siblings in albanias capital of 
tirana who have been living as refugees in the italian embassy for 
more than four years 
the popaj family members two brothers and four sisters aged 52 
to 65 walked into italias embassy on dec 12 1985 and demanded 
asylum they told diplomats they had been confined almost 20 years 
to kules a village west of tirana because a brother had defected 
to the west 
it was the first known case of albanians seeking shelter in a 
western embassy in tirana 
the albanian state ata news agency monday quoted a foreign 
ministry spokesman who said the italian embassy is informed 
that if the popaj brothers wish they are free to go abroad being 
equipped with albanian passports and exit visas 
the statement added that the family could leave albania a 
hardline stalinist regime that in recent months seems to be 
loosening some of its controls in one or two days after they make 
a formal request to emigrate 
it was unclear why the albanian statement referred to the six as 
brothers and there was no information on the condition of the six 
this humanitarian solution serves also the promotion of 
the spirit of friendship existing in albanianitalian relations 
ata reported 
in reaction an italian foreign ministry spokesman said there 
is a readiness and will on the part of albania just as there is a 
readiness and will on our part for a solution 
italian lawmakers have repeatedly asked albania to permit the 
emigration of the siblings

ethiopian warplanes dropped cluster bombs 
on the guerrillaheld red sea port of massawa killing 50 civilians 
and wounding 110 the rebels said monday 
the eritrean peoples liberation front said the death toll from 
sundays air attack was expected to rise as many of the wounded 
were in very bad condition according to a clandestine radio 
report monitored in the kenyan capital nairobi 
the radio said 50 homes were destroyed when the warplanes made 
two bombing runs on massawa one in the midmorning and one in the 
early evening 
the rebeloperated voice of the broad masses of eritrea reported 
no further details of the air strikes the latest since 
secessionist guerrillas captured the important port from government 
forces in february 
there was no reaction from the ethiopian government which 
rarely comments on rebel claims the report on the air raids could 
not be independently verified because observers are banned from 
areas of conflict 
massawa is one of two strategic harbors that have traditionally 
handled most of ethiopias trade and international relief supplies 
for millions of people threatened with starvation in the face of 
war and drought 
the eritrean front has been fighting for control of ethiopias 
northernmost province since 1961 a year after the former italian 
colony of eritrea lost its autonomy and was forcibly annexed by the 
late emperor haile selassie 
rebels hold other towns and villages in eritrea and with 
backing from other guerrilla armies are seeking to overthrow the 
marxist regime of president mengistu haile mariam 
the rebel radio has reported several previous raids by warplanes 
dropping cluster bombs and napalm on civilians the reports have 
been denied by addis ababa 
israel has been accused of supplying the cluster bombs which 
contain dozens of smaller grenadelike bomblets that hurl shrapnel 
over wide areas 
both israel and ethiopia have denied these claims

a panel of residents decided the xrated 
movie amber pays the rent violates community standards 
clearing the way for the removal of all adult videos from a store 
city officials announced monday 
more than twothirds of the 45member panel said the video 
appealed to prurient interests and nearly that number said it 
offended their personal standards 
the movie depicts the lives of several female roommates who pay 
their bills by way of sexual favors 
i think the result is clear said stephen klein a city 
attorney for the western ohio community of 20000 about 30 miles 
north of dayton 
the marketplace has spoken he said 
neither owner john rimkus of home video ventures or his 
attorney louis sirkin immediately responded to calls seeking 
comment 
klein said he planned to inform sirkin of the results and 
expects all of the adult videos to be removed from the store within 
about two weeks 
the panel was approved last october as attorneys prepared for a 
court fight over adult videos available at the store 
klein said the owner agreed to remove all adult tapes if the 
vote went against the film although the ruling was not binding to 
showcase video another store renting adult videos 
these results are clear enough that the city will not hesitate 
to proceed in court with this as evidence and attempt to have the 
community standards imposed legally on the other store he said 
we now have the ammunition 
klein said communities can set their own standards on obscenity 
based on a 1973 us supreme court ruling in a california case that 
established the criteria he said the test included whether the 
average person finds that the material appeals to prurient 
interests 
the panel chosen on the basis of age race education income 
and religion was designed to represent the makeup of piqua panel 
members watched the 80minute video in individual viewings last 
week and then answered two questions 
asked if they thought the film appealed to a morbid shameful or 
unhealthy interest in sex 667 percent said yes and 311 percent 
said no asked if it offended their personal standards 644 said 
yes and 333 percent said no the remainder said they didnt know 
or were undecided 
male and female panelists differed in their opinions eighty 
percent of women and 50 percent of men said the film appealed to 
prurient interests forty percent of men said the film offended 
their personal standards compared with 84 percent of women 
said panelist eric fries 27 as far as a porno flick goes it 
was fairly obscene

lithuanians woke monday to a world of 
impending shortages and while the soviet economic embargo hadnt 
taken full effect yet life wasnt exactly proceeding normally 
either 
vilnius enjoyed another sunny spring day and tulips were 
beginning to bloom in carefully tended public gardens throughout 
the lithuanian capital outwardly the city seemed to be shrugging 
off the threat of a cut of most supplies from moscow 
but some bus routes were canceled to save fuel consumers were 
lining up for many goods and there was talk of opening embargo 
funds for gasoline coupons to get the embattled baltic republic 
through what most expect will be a difficult period 
whether its necessary or not people are lining up to buy 
it said a saleswoman taking a break in the bright sun outside 
the citys modern new department store its for everything it 
doesnt matter what it is 
inside there were especially long lines to get into the 
department selling fabric blankets and pillows long lines also 
were reported in some city food stores 
the threat of a cutoff of all shipments from the soviet union 
has made people of this independenceminded republic realize they 
have few raw materials and depend on shipments from elsewhere to 
provide the materials to run their factories said the saleswoman 
an ethnic pole who declined to give her name 
while people were not buying out of panic they clearly were 
stocking up just in case she said 
officials of the sajudis political movement were collecting 
money for an embargo fund at the end of a twoday congress on 
sunday the organization collected 9230 in rubles from its 
members an official said an elderly woman also had pledged the 
6480 in rubles she received from the soviet government in 
compensation for being wrongly sent to siberia years earlier 
there also was a proposal to begin collecting items of gold that 
lithuanians wanted to contribute to sell abroad and earn foreign 
currency she said but that idea was on hold because there was no 
safe place to store it 
some bus routes into downtown were canceled residents of the 
virsuliskis district outside vilnius were forced to find another 
way to get to work monday morning 
all along the route of bus 11 through downtown handwritten 
notes were pasted telling riders the route temporarily was out of 
operation it normally runs at intervals of 1020 minutes from 
about 6 am to midnight 
taxis hit by the governments strict limit of about 7 gallons 
of gas per car per month were difficult to find 
but the citys extensive system of trolleybuses continued to 
operate on schedule 
alla gecauniene a middleaged railroad worker selling her 
daffodils and carnations on a street corner for extra money said 
residents of her village of lentvis 11 miles from vilnius were 
having a hard time getting into the capital 
instead of a bus every hour on sunday there was only one bus to 
the capital and one back she said 
the russians poles and lithuanians living in her village of 
about 4000 were still getting along and there were no plans so 
far to shut down the main industry a sewing factory she said 
despite the heightened political tension the ethnic lithuanian 
woman said she really didnt know what all the fuss was about 
whatever government is running the republic must fill the store 
shelves better she said 
we produce stockings in lithuania soap and shampoo she 
said where are they 
im not involved in politics she added i just want full 
stores so i can buy what i want

a bipartisan band of past and current 
congressional challengers called monday for a political 
housecleaning to end the imperial permanent congress 
our federally elected officials have so rigged the process 
that they are impossible to unseat said harold coker a 
chattanooga tenn republican who ran unsuccessfully for congress 
in 1988 
his complaint was the central theme at a meeting of the 
coalition to end the permanent congress a grassroots organization 
formed in protest of the 1988 elections in which 985 percent of 
house incumbents seeking reelection were successful 
coker was one of about three dozen congressional candidates 
some seeking office this year and others having lost earlier 
contests to attend the meeting 
the coalition members representing at least 18 states 
advocated a lengthy list of reform proposals among them were a ban 
on taxpayerpaid mass mailings by members of congress prohibiting 
lawmakers from accepting honoraria or speaking fees eliminating 
political action committees which contribute mostly to campaigns 
of incumbents and imposing a 12year limit on how long members can 
serve in the house and the senate 
the coalitions assault on incumbency came as the senate 
prepared to consider legislation to overhaul the system of 
financing congressional campaigns lionel kunst a kansas democrat 
who helped found the coalition rejected the legislation as 
pablum and said it would do little for challengers 
the coalition did approve of one proposal that could surface in 
the senate debate however group members embraced the idea of 
providing free television time to incumbents and challengers a 
senate leadership task force has suggested giving political parties 
free tv time to divide among candidates 
although the desire to win election to congress brought the 
group together its members maintained they had a much loftier goal 
of reviving government 
im here because congress is not doing the job theyre not 
solving the problems of america complained coker 
bernard tomkin an elkins park pa democrat who is running 
again after a loss in 1988 put it this way unless we find a way 
to clean up and ventilate our political process then we are 
letting our future generation down

the rev ralph david abernathy was carried to his 
crypt monday on a wave of praise riding in a plain muledrawn 
wooden wagon flanked by his sons and colleagues in the civil rights 
movement 
the procession followed a service at which civil rights leaders 
who criticized abernathy for his controversial account of martin 
luther king jr got a public rebuke 
the famous and the humble piled shouldertoshoulder inside a 
southwest atlanta church for the fourhour service for the man who 
was kings longtime chief lieutenant in the civil rights movement 
afterward two mules pulling a green wooden wagon bearing 
abernathys casket set out from west hunter street baptist church 
where abernathy was pastor for lincoln cemetery 
kings body was carried to its resting place by a muledrawn 
wagon after he was assassinated in 1968 at the suggestion of 
abernathy who considered it symbolic of humility relatives said 
abernathy wanted the same for himself 
abernathys bier traveled in a twohour procession of 22 
limousines that passed dilapidated buildings and drugnfested 
communities along the street named in honor of king 
groups of people some with children and pets lined sidewalks 
as the wagon inched along in a sea of 150 suited marchers 
including abernathys sons kwame and state rep ralph david 
abernathy iii and movement associates andrew young and the rev 
jesse jackson 
among those speaking at the funeral was georgia state rep 
tyrone brooks who said said the civil rights movement should be 
proud instead of embarrassed by abernathys book the walls came 
tumbling down the autobiography published last year touched on 
kings alleged extramarital affairs 
brooks who was a student activist in the 1960s stood in the 
pulpit above abernathys rosecovered coffin and waved a copy of 
the book he urged the crowd of 2500 to read it 
it was not a mistake brooks said it is the truth all 
636 pages 
among those present were kings widow coretta scott king and 
three of her children kings sister christine king farris 
benjamin hooks head of the naacp us rep john lewis dga 
robert kennedy jr archbishop eugene marino and health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan 
abernathy who was kings closest friend and adviser died april 
17 of a heart attack induced by a blood clot he was 64 
jackson said abernathys accomplishments through the civil 
rights movement far outshadow any disagreement brought by his 
memoirs 
one cannot judge a player by one exceptional play jackson 
said nor can a player be judged by an error ralph abernathy is 
in the hall of fame we must pay homage and thanks 
hugh gloster president emeritus of morehouse college kings 
alma mater described abernathy as second only to martin luther 
king as a leader in the civil rights movement 
you have had your share of abuse and scorn gloster said 
abernathys son ralph david abernathy iii compared his father 
to the biblical hero david saying he slew the goliath of 
racism and served as a stellar role model 
i am the son of a giant slayer he said

sudans military ruler said loyalist 
forces thwarted a coup attempt by army officers monday arrested 
those involved and quickly restored peace to this east african 
nation 
lt gen omar hassan elbashir the countrys military leader 
said the coup attempt was led by active and retired military 
officers it was the second reported attempt in a month to 
overthrow the ruling junta 
all those involved in the attempt have been arrested 
elbashir said in a speech broadcast at midday over official radio 
omduran 
a government spokesman said most of the rebels surrendered 
without a fight and there were no casualties sources in khartoum 
said one soldier was slightly wounded in a brief shootout 
elbashir said the coup was easily suppressed because the coups 
plotters had been under surveillance by authorities from the start 
of the takeover attempt 
informed sources in the capital khartoum said the army 
appeared to have had little trouble putting down a series of 
attacks by junior army officers 
government spokesman mohammed khogali salihein said authorities 
had previously arrested 30 officers involved in a march coup 
attempt and later received information that a second group of 
officers were planning mondays coup 
he said the government took measures to prevent the move from 
the start and was able to convince the rebels to surrender 
without a fight 
there was no fighting and consequently no casualties 
salihein said 
he said the coups two leaders retired maj gen abdulkadir 
alkadaru and retired brig mohammed osman hamid karrar gave 
themselves up after they were assured they would stand a fair trial 
elbashir said the abortive coup was plotted by the alliance 
in coalition with the outlaws he did not elaborate 
the alliance was possibly a reference to political parties 
disbanded by elbashir after his junta took control of the country 
on june 30 
the government has often used the term outlaws to refer to 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army which has been waging a 
sevenyear insurgency seeking autonomy and greater economic reforms 
for the countrys three southern provinces 
sudanese sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
attempted coup began at midnight and the rebels tried to take over 
khartoum airport and the official government radio they were 
quickly overcome 
they tried to take over the airport and the radio in a rather 
pathetic way and were very unsuccessful one source said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said several 
rebel officers also tried to shoot their way into the downtown 
headquarters of the armed forces general command apparently in 
search of elbashir they were unable to get through the front gate 
one guard at the general command was reportedly wounded in the 
hand sources said 
khartoum airport was closed briefly and telecommunications were 
cut for several hours by midmorning khartoum was peaceful 
in the capital troops supported by tanks guarded bridges and 
the militarys general command the army was reportedly on full 
alert but there seemed to be no special security precautions on 
the streets of the khartoum 
elbashir came to power in june after he overthrew prime 
minister sadek elmahdis civilian government elbashir has said 
his principal aims are to end the rebel insurgency in the south and 
improve the countrys faltering economy 
he has had little success

seven cars of the eastbound california zephyr derailed about 
125 pm on burlington northern tracks authorities said 
eyewitnesses counted as many as nine cars off the track 
it made a hell of a noise and then all kind of dust started 
flying said robert franklin of batavia 
it was just one big loud bang kind of like a clankety 
clang said his wife patricia

the train had 12 passenger cars four baggage cars and three 
locomotives said sue martin an amtrak spokeswoman in washington 
marci larson another amtrak spokeswoman in washington said the 
last seven cars derailed three remained upright three were left 
leaning and one a sleeper car was turned on its side 
amtrak officials said they did not know how fast the train was 
traveling when the cars left the tracks and that the trains 
black box would have to be examined the train is authorized to 
travel as fast as 79 mph in the area they said 
among the passengers was wisconsin state rep marlin schneider

hitting 
paul tray 29 of batavia said workers were using a ladder to 
climb down into the tippedover cars searching for people who 
might be in the wreckage

from a steady rain 
polhills two sons stephen 26 and brian 23 were expected to

initiative that promises palestinian elections in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip he also agreed to accept a preliminary meeting

firefighters worked monday to extinguish 
three burning train cars and crews skimmed crude oil from the 
surface of a creek that was fouled when a freight train derailed 
and caught fire 
twentynine cars in a 97car buffalo and pittsburgh railroad 
inc train derailed in this sparsely populated rural community

10000 gallons of sodium hydroxide a caustic chemical used to 
clean drains leaked from one car said john bell the railroads 
vice president and general manager 
heat from two coal cars that caught fire sunday night warmed six 
derailed oil tankers to dangerously high temperatures officials 
said three oil tankers that had collided burned intermittently 
officials said 
to ease the heat one of the two coal cars was moved late monday 
afternoon to a field about 150 yards away from the track bell 
said smoldering coal was spread over the ground and sprayed with a 
special water solution to cool it 
crews began moving the second car early in the evening 
officials said 
the situation at present is unstable there are still isolated 
fires flaring up on occasion said lt gov mark singel who 
visited the scene 
firefighters sprayed the oil cars with water to cool them said 
bob walker hazardous materials coordinator for armstrong countys 
emergency management agency 
most of the leaks in the tanker cars were plugged by afternoon 
bell said 
about 200 people had been evacuated late sunday but most were 
allowed to return home monday an evacuation order remained in 
effect for about 50 people who lived within a quartermile of the 
accident because of the possibility of an explosion bell said 
although some oil spilled into buffalo creek most of it burned 
off in the fire bell saidthe creek flows into the allegheny 
river the source of drinking water for several pittsburgharea 
communities 
the spill was expected to have no significant impact on drinking 
water supplies said charles duritsa a regional director for the 
state department of environmental resources 
the environmental impact was pretty much controlled by teams 
diking the accident site duritsa said 
authorities were investigating the cause of the crash bell said 
several of the derailed cars lay in a zigzag pattern and white 
smoke poured from burning coal cars monday afternoon fire 
smoldered in a stream of oil that flowed from one car into a ravine 
firefighters used hoses to suck oil and sodium hydroxide from 
the ground booms set up along buffalo creek skimmed globs of oil 
from the surface of the water 
a car that had contained 18000 to 20000 gallons of sodium 
hydroxide had been turned upright about half of the chemical 
leaked from an inspection pipe atop the car when it was flipped 
upside down in the derailment 
the two conductors who were not injured were given drug and 
alcohol tests as is routine after accidents bell said they told 
the railroad they were traveling about 20 mph when the derailment 
occurred bell said the company speed limit for the craigsville 
area is 25 mph 
thousands of dead fish were found in buffalo creek a popular 
fishing spot said emil svetahor an official with the state fish 
commission the commission had planned to stock the creek with more 
fish friday but those plans have been canceled svetahor said

from the crash were in their living room when the train passed by 
it was the fastest train ive ever heard go through here

a private human rights monitoring group 
appealed to japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu on monday to 
spare an accused chinese hijacker from probable torture in china 
and let him be tried in japan 
extraditing zhang zhenhai to china would be a serious human 
rights violation because he would likely be tortured by 
chinese authorities both for participation in the democracy 
movement and for his hijacking of a chinese airliner last 
december asia watch said in a message to kaifu 
asia watch appealed to kaifu on the basis of a tokyo report that 
zhang could be deported to china this week justice minister shin 
hasegawa issued an order for his extradition monday 
we obviously do not condone hijacking but no one should be 
subjected to torture said the signer of the appeal asia watch 
executive director sidney jones 
asia watch is affiliated with helsinki watch which oversees 
human rights guidelines of the 1975 helsinki agreement on eastwest 
cooperation and security 
asia watch has documented several cases of torture in chinese 
prisons including many participants in the crushed 1989 democracy 
movement ms jones said 
the tokyo high court last week upheld the japanese governments 
intention to deny political asylum to zhang overruling his defense 
that his offense was political 
zhang now 36 had actively participated in the 1979 democracy 
wall movement and in the 1989 demonstrations in beijings tiananmen 
square his lawyers said 
police said he hijacked a chinese jumbo jet en route from 
beijing to new york with 233 people aboard threatening to blow it 
up with a bomb he did not actually have the plane landed at 
fukuoka japan and zhangs wife and 13yearold son were returned 
to china the next day 
japanese prosecutors said zhang was not involved in political 
activity and was seeking to flee criminal charges described by 
chinese television as embezzlement 
in another development two members of the house of 
representatives launched a republican launched a campaign for 
colleagues in congress to adopt some of the perhaps 30000 
people they said are in chinese prisons for backing the democracy 
movement crushed last year 
we want the beijing government to know that we have not 
forgotten and will not forget the courageous men and women who 
risked their lives in the struggle for democratic reform reps 
ted weiss dny and john miller rwash said in a letter to 
house members 
they asked colleagues to write letters to chinese authorities in 
behalf of individual adoptees to insert statements in the 
daily congressional record on their behalf and to bring up their 
names when travelling in china

king the troubled london musical about martin 
luther king jr opened monday to a fourminute standing ovation 
but poor reviews from the critics 
someone should put on a musical about the making of king it 
would probably turn out to be a good deal more entertaining than 
king itself charles spencer in the daily telegraph wrote the 
show bowed at the piccadilly theater after its original opening 
date april 4 was postponed three times 
maureen paton in the daily express wrote this treatment comes 
across as a simplified version for children it may be 
wellmeaning but its an insult to adults 
the show stars opera singers simon estes and cynthia haymon 
their strong singing deflected doubts about the absence of any 
insight into the private lives behind the public persona of the 
slain black civil rights leader and his wife coretta 
mondays premier brought to an end weeks of speculation about 
the show which for several weeks was making headlines almost daily 
as various directors and writers parted company with the project 
on march 6 coretta scott king announced in a statement that she 
was withdrawing her support because the show trivialized her 
husband she restored her support a week into previews 
the poet and lyricist maya angelou who withdrew at the same 
time as mrs king has yet to lend her support anew 
the finished product bears lyrics by both angelou and alistair 
beaton the briton who cowrote the 1988 london flop ziegfeld 
the director 39yearold clarke peters is a black american 
based in london who has the supporting role in the show as the 
garage mechanic george he was hired after gotz friedrich and 
graham vick two directors known for their work in opera quit the 
musical 
the book is billed as an adaptation by lonne elder iii an 
oscar nominee for the film sounder who followed fellow 
playwrights ron milner and richard nelson neither of whom receives 
credit in the program the sheer quantity of creative participants 
must account in part for the confused narrative and 
characterization of king 
spencer wrote in the daily telegraph it is sometimes hard to 
make out exactly what is going on still less where or when 
king is budgeted at 45 million and breaks even at close 
to 50 percent in the 1168seat theater according to producer 
hans flury 
the top ticket price of 41 puts king on financial par with 
londons reigning musical blockbusters miss saigon and the 
phantom of the opera 
of the advance sale executive producer peter wilson would say 
only that it is very satisfying 
there was a standing ovation that lasted four minutes following 
the opening

quarter church leaders said 
the announcement came one day after the israeli government 
confirmed it put up 18 million to help finance the settlement of 
150 jews in a 72room complex near the church of the holy sepulcher 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
called the settler move into the christian quarter an insensitive 
and provocative action 
she said israels funding of the settlement is deeply 
disturbing and that us ambassador william brown was raising the 
issue with israeli officials 
in response foreign ministry spokesman yossi amihud said 
jerusalem is the sovereign capital of the state of israel and the 
government of israel will continue to stand by the rights of jews 
to settle in jerusalem 
in athens foreign minister antonis samaras summoned israels 
diplomatic representative moshe gilboa to protest the settlement 
government spokesman vyron polydoras said the settlement is in a 
compound owned by the greek orthodox church 
archbishop serapheim head of the greek orthodox church in 
greece also protested monday to israeli caretaker prime minister 
yitzhak shamir over the occupation 
the settlement set up april 11 has provoked angry 
demonstrations by christian clerics and palestinians both 
christian and moslem 
in announcing fridays daylong protest the leaders of 10 
christian sects in the holy land said government support for the 
settlement endangers the survival of all christian communities in 
the holy city 
we demand respect of the privileges and rights the christians 
have in the holy land greek orthodox patriarch diodorus i said 
on monday 
the settlement called neot david is the only jewish presence 
in the old citys christian sector its spokesmen have consistently 
said that no government money was involved in the settlement 
palestinian christians have complained that the settlement 
threatened the traditional separation of the christian moslem and 
jewish quarters of the old city 
the greek church which says a former tenant illegally leased 
the compound got an court order to have the jews evicted the 
supreme court will consider an appeal of the order on thursday 
fridays protest will mark the first time all christian holy 
places close said the rt rev samir kafiti anglican bishop of 
jerusalem the church leaders included roman catholic coptic and 
lutheran officials 
among the christian sites to be closed are jerusalems church of 
the holy sepulcher bethlehems church of the nativity and the 
church of the annunciation in nazareth 
israels religious affairs ministry said in a statement that the 
action gives rise to a suspicion that it might be an attempt to 
influence the supreme court which is hearing an appeal of an 
order to evict the jews 
the ministry also accused church leaders of a basic and 
serious violation of the statusquo of holy places that we try so 
much to preserve in order to allow an orderly religious worship 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said he was sorry the churches 
undertook drastic action before the legal process was completed 
but he condemned the damage to coexistence in the city and the 
standing of jerusalem caused by the settlers he said government 
support only deepens the doubts and sharpens the fears of the 
churches in jerusalem 
the governments acknowledgement sunday that it helped finance 
the settlement was the first confirmation of official involvement 
in buying arab property in jerusalems walled old city captured by 
israel in the 1967 middle east war 
it came as settlers prepared a new settlement in the occupied 
gaza strip and the government authorized the expansion of 
settlements in the occupied west bank 
the settlement activity follows the march 15 collapse of the 
coalition cabinet that left the government in the hands of shamir 
and his rightwing likud bloc which favors retaining the occupied 
territories 
shamir is leading the government on a caretaker basis while 
labor party leader shimon peres tries to form a government with 
ultraorthodox parties 
about 75000 jewish settlers live in the occupied lands home to 
17 million palestinians who have a rebellion for 28 months 
against israeli rule 
the christian leaders said the church will hold the protest 
regardless of the supreme court decision 
the church closure will be in effect between 9 am friday and 
an unspecified hour saturday church bells will toll on the hour 
from 9 am until noon friday 
diodorus i and kafiti said the closure may be longer than 
announced

us eastern orthodox leaders have voiced their 
distress at recent jewish settlements in the christian sector of 
the old city of jerusalem charging that church property was 
occupied 
they asked for a meeting with secretary of state james a baker 
iii about the unjustified occupation and subsequent 
provocative incidents church officials announced monday 
telegrams about the matter were sent last week to baker 
jerusalems greek orthodox patriarch diodoros and to israels 
president chaim herzog 
american jewish leaders also criticized the settlement of 20 
jewish families in the christian quarter of jerusalem the move set 
off criticism in israel as well as elsewhere 
in jerusalem monday church leaders announced that christian 
shrines in the holy land will close friday and ring a funeral toll 
from their belltowers to protest the settlement 
fridays protest will mark the first time all christian holy 
places close said the rt rev samir kafiti anglican bishop of 
jerusalem the church leaders announcing the plan included roman 
catholic coptic and lutheran officials 
among the christian sites to be closed are jerusalems church of 
the holy sepulcher bethlehems church of the nativity and the 
church of the annunciation in nazareth 
the standing conference of canonical orthodox bishops in the 
americas including eight wings of eastern orthodoxy totaling more 
than 7 million members termed the settlements another obstacle 
to peace 
in their message to herzog they expressed our distressover 
the violent occupation by jewish settlers of property that belongs 
to the greek orthodox patriarchate of jerusalem 
the bishops said they expected a prompt and just solution to 
the problem by the removal of the settlers and return of this 
property to the church 
in jerusalem the jewish families totaling about 150 members had 
moved into st johns hospice near the church of the holy 
sepulchre on good friday marking the crucifixion of christ 
they claimed that most of the approximately 4 million spent to 
sublet the property from an armenian family that had leased it from 
the greek orthodox church came from unidentified american donors 
however the israeli government acknowledged sunday that it had 
secretly provided about 2 million to help establish a jewish 
settlement in the christian quarter 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of major american 
jewish organizations said the settlement of the jewish families 
was offensive and an unnecessary provocation 
he said the action was especially disturbing since it occurred 
during the celebration of holy week by christians and ramadan by 
moslems 
reich who also is international president of bnai brith 
noted the settlers had covered a cross over a main door with a 
poster of the star of david he said this could be viewed as 
insensitive or even a degradation 
this was a deliberate provocation he added 
the bishops protest was issued after a meeting april 19 of the 
various national wings of us orthodoxy under chairmanship of 
greek orthodox archbishop iakovos 
they told baker that difficulties in the occupied territories 
and lebanon coupled with the jewish occupation in holy week of 
greek orthodox property necessitated an early meeting with him 
they expressed our painful concern over these violations to 
baker and in a separate telegram to patriarch diodoros said 
we are disheartened by the recent illegal actions that 
occurred during the passion week of our lord

hundreds of environmentalists demonstrated monday in the 
financial districts of new york and san francisco where postearth

pacific gas amp electric customers in santa cruz and watsonville 
in new york police arrested about 204 of an estimated 700 
demonstrators two protestors were charged with assaulting an 
officer and the rest with disorderly conduct according to police 
spokesmen 
the major corporations have committed a lot of crimes against 
nature said marc chernoff 30 a member of new yorks coalition 
for a nuclear free harbor its long overdue to place the blame 
where it directly belongs if the products that pollute were not 
made available people would not buy them 
trade on the new york stock exchange went on as scheduled and 
none of the protesters got inside except for getting up a little 
early its a pretty normal day said the exchanges senior vice 
president richard torrenzano

attention on institutions responsible for much of the ecological 
devastation which is destroying the planet

think anyone is taking this seriously besides them

hear us said debbie augustine 34 of loudon nh a member of 
the antinuclear power clamshell alliance 
a spokesman for the san francisco demonstrators daniel 
finkenthal of the earth day action coalition said the purpose of 
the protest there was to give the public an alternative to the 
corporatesponsored views of environmental action that preceded 
earth day 
yesterday these corporations came into our community and spent 
a lot of money on a media coup to try to convince the american 
public that environmental protection and reform was high on the 
corporate agenda but its the lowest priority finkenthal said 
in fact theyre spending more money on earth day promotion than 
they are on actual corporate reform and the environment 
the group that claimed responsibility for the two california 
outages called itself earth night action group and said the target 
was pacific gas amp electric a corporate earth rapist residents 
of santa cruz and watsonville were affected by the outages sunday

trash left by the crowds who gathered to celebrate a cleaner earth 
in baton rouge la the grounds of the old state capitol and 
the centroplex auditorium were strewn with trash and it took an 
eightperson city crew and a few volunteers three hours and about 
65 overflowing trash bins to clean up 
youre not going to change peoples actions overnight said 
local earth day chairman paul davidson id like to think its 
cleaner than at past festivals but i dont know 
new york city was better off even though an estimated 750000 
to 1 million people gathered in central park for music and 
speeches before the celebration the parks department put out 250 
55gallon trash drums and 20 15gallon recycling bins 
we estimate that 90 percent of all refuse from the concert was 
either put into the drums or recycling bins or was placed very 
carefully right next to them on the ground when the receptacles 
became too full said parks department spokeswoman abigail meisel 
by midday monday workers had carted away 1 ton of newspapers 
for recycling 33 tons of metal and glass for recycling and 150 
tons of other refuse she said 
the crowd on the mall in washington dc was smaller more 
than 125000 people and they left only 6 to 7 tons of trash said

president bush is ready to announce a series 
of economic penalties against the soviet union in response to 
moscows crackdown on lithuania us officials said monday 
bush was expected to outline his trategy at a tuesday meeting 
with congressional leaders said officials who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
among the steps will be postponment and withholding of a variety 
of trade and economic concessions that the soviet union is seeking 
from the united states the officials said 
however the administrations measures are not intended to 
interfere with ussoviet arms negotiations or to postpone the may 
30june 3 superpower summit the officials said 
although exact details of the administrations package were not 
clear the general thrust will be to slow down ussoviet trade 
liberalization talks which had been scheduled to resume in paris 
on tuesday the officials said 
among the actions expected to be announced by bush on tuesday 
are a withdrawl of his earlier us support for moscows bid for 
observer status in the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
international organization that oversees freemarket trading rules 
although such an approach would be a measured one the sanctions 
could help mute criticism in congress that the bush administration 
wasnt doing enough to respond to the soviets tightening crackdown 
in lithuania 
moscow last week sharply curtailed oil and natural gas supplies 
to the secessionist state 
earlier monday the white house welcomed what it called signs of 
flexibility from moscow in its standoff with lithuania and 
officials said that the president remained hopeful that the crisis 
still could be resolved through negotiations between moscow and the 
rebellious baltic republic 
bush earlier had proposed a variety of us help to the ailing 
soviet economy ranging from technical assistance to an easing of 
legal restrictions on ussoviet trade that are now expected to 
be put on hold 
bush answering reporters who asked if he might call off the 
trade talks in response to the soviet economic crackdown said 
ill sure let you know when i make a decision 
secretary of state james a baker iii cautioned last week that 
economic relations are being put to risk by soviet actions in 
lithuania 
before the officials disclosed bushs course baker said 
consultations with west european governments on a course of action 
will be completed very soon he denied reports the 
administration was taking its time in the hopes a solution would 
emerge saying we are not dragging our feet 
in a sign of business as usual a senior state department 
official said monday that baker will meet may 5 in bonn with the 
foreign ministers of the soviet union britain and france on 
security concerns raised by prospects of german unification 
in moscow the spokesman for soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
said the kremlin might negotiate with lithuania if it freezes its 
march 11 declaration of independence for two years 
arkady maslennikov gorbachevs press secretary said soviet 
leaders were willing to talk to lithuanian leaders if they will 
acknowledge they are still subject to the soviet constitution 
lithuanian leaders have refused to do that saying the republic 
was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
the constitution guarantees the right of secession in principle 
but the soviet union has never passed implementing legislation 
gorbachev and other soviet leaders have acknowledged that the 1940 
annexation was illegal 
lithuania and its sister baltic republics of estonia and latvia 
had belonged to the russian czars for 200 years when in the 
turmoil that followed the communist revolution of 1917 they 
established themselves as independent countries recognized by the 
soviet union in 1920 
lithuanias 38 million people began their first full work week 
since gorbachev cut off supplies of oil natural gas and other raw 
materials to the republic on sunday lithuania halted exports to 
soviet republics and foreign customers 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that the bush 
adminstration was still consulting with allies on what course to 
take 
the statements from the kremlin do appear to show some 
flexibility we are hopeful that thats the case he said 
its impossible for us to know exactly what these statements 
mean but if they are indicative of the two sides being able to 
get together that would be a welcome sign fitzwater said 
baker discussed lithuania at the state department with european 
community officials 
weve talked at some length of course about the problems of 
ethnic divisions that face the soviet union and weve talked about 
the fact that instability in the soviet union does not operate to 
the advantage of anyone and is not something to be desired baker 
said at a news conference 
meanwhile a planned meeting monday between alexsandr yakovlev 
the soviet communist party secretary and vice president dan quayle 
was postponed at the soviets request the white house said the 
soviets gave no reason for postponing the meeting

open accounts of less than 30000 company officials said monday

for parole again april 18 said he would be a free man had he spent 
his 29 years in the louisiana state penitentiary making license 
plates instead of running a newspaper 
rideau was convicted of killing a woman by cutting her throat 
and stabbing her in the heart 
ive tried to make amends the best i could in the only ways 
available to me ive done things that counted over the last 29 
years he said that was the only violent act of my life done 
when i was a wild teenager if i could change it i would 
on april 18 the louisiana pardon board recommended for the 
fourth time in six years that rideau be set free gov buddy roemer 
said he is inclined to reject the unanimous recommendation to 
commute rideaus life sentence a decision was not expected for at 
least a week 
rideau has been called a model inmate by prison authorities the 
editor of the prison magazine the angolite he also gives lectures 
to youth groups and gets out to go on national speaking tours on 
prison reform over the years he has had a literary agent and 
written freelance articles for up to four figures for publications 
such as penthouse 
rideau has won the robert f kennedy journalism award the

the angolite which has carried stories on inmate suicides 
prison riots prisoner rights executions prison sports and 
special events was featured in the new york times sunday magazine

columbia journalism review 
rideau has appeared on national tv including abcs 
nightline on which he was on a fiveman panel with former 
chief justice warren e burger in a discussion of prison reform 
and that is why rideau thinks hes still in prison 
lets face it theyve released thousands of murderers since 
ive been in prison ive watched them come in and go out all 
anonymous he said 
the governor hasnt searched out the families of their victims 
to talk to theyve managed to get out because their greatest 
achievement as a prisoner was that they remained anonymous 
of the 31 prisoners sentenced to either death or life in prison 
sent to louisiana state penitentiary in 1962 only rideau remains 
behind bars 
its not like im asking for special treatment or 
consideration not when the system has released everybody else 
routinely convicted of the same or worse crimes the system exists 
for everybody else in the state but wilbert rideau he said

a lawyer for united press international told a 
federal appeals court april 18 it could go out of business if 
reuters is allowed to terminate a photo exchange agreement 
three judges of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals reserved 
decision on upis request for an injunction barring reuters from 
terminating the contract 
the judges however extended an earlier stay that keeps the 
agreement in effect until they issue a written decision 
the contract between the news services was made in 1984 and 
called for upi to supply reuters with pictures from the united 
states and for reuters to provide upi with pictures from other 
countries it was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985 
we will immediately lose customers the minute reuters cuts us 
off upi lawyer mitchell karlan told the court if we are 
unable to get pictures from reuters upi is going out of business 
upi is appealing a decision by us district judge peter k 
leisure that the agency had not shown it would be irreparably 
harmed if the arrangement was discontinued 
the injunction request stemmed from a counterclaim by upi to a 
reuters lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange agreement 
reuters said the agreement was not living up to expectations 
robert sugarman an attorney for reuters argued against the 
injunction on the grounds that upi had not shown how many customers 
it would lose without foreign photos from reuters 
sugarman pointed to testimony from upi chairman earl brian that 
upi had negotiated to receive foreign photos from the french news 
service agence francepresse for a threemonth period in the 
event the reuters contract is discontinued 
in a statement brian said we will continue to pursue upis 
rights by confronting reuters erratic and unwarranted behavior we 
take further encouragement from todays hearing and continuation of 
the order against reuters 
we at upi consider photos and graphics a strategically vital 
component of our business today and in the 1990s he said

legislation requiring newspaper 
editorial writers to sign their work and disclose financial 
interests may get watered down in the face of uncertain support 
the bills sponsor said april 16 
id like to salvage the whole thing but im a realist said 
rep bruce mcewan rorlando 
mcewan couldnt gauge the support he had for the bill april 16 
before the house judiciary committee and asked that a vote be 
delayed a week the bill squeaked out of subcommittee earlier this 
month on a 43 vote and mcewan acknowledged many lawmakers are 
concerned that it might infringe on the first amendments press 
protections 
the bill would include newspaper editorial board members under a 
law requiring state managers and most elected officials to file 
financial disclosure forms by july 1 every year or face a possible 
5000 fine 
the public perception out there is that a lot of the 
newspapers have special interests too mcewan said 
in addition the bill would make it a seconddegree misdemeanor 
for a newspaper to print any unsigned editorial

a judge on april 17 ordered the state to 
pay more than 31000 in lawyers fees to the orlando sentinel and 
florida today after ruling that a prosecutor wrongly prevented 
reporters from obtaining records in a murder case 
state attorney norm wolfinger denied requests for copies of 
ballistic reports bloodalcohol tests autopsy records and other 
materials following the shooting deaths of six people at two 
shopping centers on april 23 1987 
wolfinger said he feared that releasing the information would 
damage cruses opportunity for a fair trial by prejudicing 
potential jurors 
judge dean moxley said in his ruling that the amount of 
publicity over the case already had been so widespread that release 
of the records would not have made a difference 
state laws provide for release of such public records and assess 
penalties against officials who refuse to do so state insurance 
plans will cover the cost of the payments 
william cruse was convicted of the murders last year and was 
sentenced to death he remains under psychiatric care at florida 
state prison

the supreme court on april 17 refused to order 
the government to reveal the names and addresses of retired or 
disabled federal workers 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by an 
organization seeking to use the information to recruit new members 
in its campaign for increased benefits for retirees 
the national association of retired federal employees used to 
have an agreement with the federal office of personnel management 
that helped the associations drive for new members 
the agency from 1979 to 1981 permitted the association to send 
information packets to newly retired federal workers through an 
independent mailing service 
after the office of personnel management ended the arrangement 
the association sought to obtain the names and addresses under the 
freedom of information act 
a federal judge ruled in favor of the association but the us 
circuit court of appeals here overturned that ruling last july 
the appeals court said revealing the names and addresses of 
retired and disabled workers would violate their privacy

the house where gen robert e lee planned 
an attack on union troops to save the confederate capital has 
become the center of a new battle preservationists are fighting a 
newspaper publisher who wants the nowcrumbling structure moved 
lockwood house is a twostory white frame plantation home where 
lee spent three nights just before the battle of cold harbor in 
hanover county in the spring of 1864 
the house rests on property purchased by media general inc for 
a new headquarters and printing plant for its two richmond 
newspapers the site is about five miles from downtown richmond 
j stewart bryan iii who is publisher of the richmond 
timesdispatch and the richmond news leader and is a member of the 
associated press board of directors has offered 50000 to help a 
purchaser move the house 
it doesnt belong on that site bryan said recently noting 
that the house is insectridden and has a rotting foundation 
but 11 organizations including the association for the 
preservation of virginia antiquities and the historic richmond 
foundation wrote to bryan last november urging protection of the 
house where it is 
historically and architecturally it would be devastating to 
move it said linda marks president of the hanover county 
historical society 
bryans greatgreat grandfather owned the house in downtown 
richmond where lees family lived during the civil war his 
greatgrandparents helped launch richmonds historic preservation 
movement and save the white house of the confederacy from 
demolition and his father d tennant bryan is president emeritus 
of the virginia historical society 
its a simple farm house built in the early 1800s where 
general lee spent two three or four nights when he was sick with a 
high fever since then nobody was interested in the house until we 
bought it said bryan 
while at lockwood house lee planned an interception of union 
troops that slowed the norths advance on richmond he also was 
visited there by confederate president jefferson davis 
the house does not stand exactly where the newspapers planned 
200 million production plant will be built but bryan said the 
plant slated for completion in 1991 would overshadow it 
overpower it 
during an open house viewing for potential buyers earlier this 
month at least 20 prospects showed up and about a dozen more have 
expressed interest in buying the structure bryan said 
we dont care about dollar offers he said we just want 
to see it put to good use

criticism was partly a friendly prod at oregonian publisher fred

mario bonilla was traveling outside nicaragua in 
1981 when he was tried for promoting human rights he never 
returned home after learning he had been sentenced to 23 years in 
prison for counterrevolutionary activities 
like an estimated 150000 other nicaraguan professionals 
bonilla a doctor fled to south florida to escape the leftist 
sandinista regime of daniel ortega 
but now that the euphoria of violeta chamorros upset 
presidential victory over ortega in february has subsided the 
professionals nicaragua needs desperately are weighing a return 
carefully and many are choosing not to go back 
some of the reasons are financial but much of the concern is 
over the role the defeated sandinistas will play after the new 
government is sworn in wednesday and how those returning will be 
treated 
we are afraid said bonilla president of the nicaraguan 
medical association in exile the sandinistas are in the same 
place with the same weapons there are only some changes in the 
administrative area at this moment

voters said her organization was targeted because it advocates 
family planning 
they right to life represent a point of view that family 
planning is not an appropriate arena for environmental action but 
if something isnt done the world population will double in the

in thumbnail appraisal the man is described 
as a consummate pragmatic politician a leader who likes power and 
will do what is necessary to keep it 
that aim is said to have been the major influence in shaping his 
drastic political economic and foreign policy moves 
the description comes from richard m nixon and it sounds as 
though the expresident is looking in the mirror 
but it is not a selfportrait it is his judgment of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev the most remarkable statesman of 
our time 
the nixon comments on gorbachev in a new book an undelivered 
speech and a public television interview are a blend of admiration 
for the soviet leaders ability and style and suspicion of his 
aims 
despite what you may hear that he could be a closet democrat 
or even a closet christian gorbachev is in fact a 
truebelieving communist nixon says his goal is not to 
abandon communism but to save it not to dismantle the soviet 
empire but to preserve it as demonstrated by the hard line he is 
taking on lithuanian independence 
but the most dominant facet of his complex personality is that 
he is a consummate pragmatic politician who likes power knows how 
to use it and will do what is necessary to keep it says nixon 
who lost his own in 1974 when he resigned to avoid impeachment over 
watergate it is this characteristic which has primarily 
influenced his decisions to adopt his revolutionary political 
economic and foreign policy reforms 
nixon made those comments in a speech he was to have delivered 
to the boston world affairs council postponed after he was 
diagnosed as suffering from a heart rhythm problem nixon 77 is 
recuperating at home in saddle river nj and is expected to 
resume his normal schedule in about a week 
in that text and his newly published eighth book in the 
arena nixons comments about the soviet leader sometimes 
parallel his observations about his own career 44 years in 
office in resignation and political disgrace and in what he now 
calls renewal 
he is a world class strategic thinker says nixon neither 
saint nor a softheaded dogooder but a skilled adroit operator in 
his own and his nations interests 
reflecting on his own foreign policy in a public broadcasting 
system interview to be broadcast may 4 nixon says his course of 
detente toward moscow wasnt softheaded negotiation but 
calculated to serve us objectives 
the detente strategy hardheaded detente that i pursued 
worked he said 
he describes his single most dramatic foreign policy move the 
1972 mission that reopened us links with china in similar terms 
he says it had nothing to do with any softening of his opposition 
to communism it had to do with strategic relationships 
politically nixon says gorbachevs reforms do not meet 
american standards but have meant breathtaking change in the 
soviet union after having had their voices stilled for over 70 
years the great silent majority of the russian people are finally 
being heard he says 
that is a special phrase for nixon as a candidate and in his 
early white house years he appealed for and claimed support from 
the great silent majority of my fellow americans 
nixon calls gorbachev the most intelligent and creative leader 
in soviet history and also the most powerful since stalin he 
says the instincts of the pragmatic politician led gorbachev to his 
attempted reforms at home and to acquiescence in the wave of 
democratic change that swept eastern europe 
simply put nixon says he had no choice but to reform at home 
and to retrench abroad he argues that it will not serve us 
interests to help gorbachev if that produces an economically 
stronger soviet union that continues to aid antiamerican regimes 
in the third world 
he says those moscow subsidies still amount to 15 billion a 
year in arms and economic aid and challenges gorbachev to end them 
as part of the price of us trade credits and technology 
still as an athlete warily praises a rival nixon praises 
gorbachev a world class strategic thinker and a wily leader 
who will survive the perils around him 
i think he will make it nixon says because he is a very 
capable and shrewd politician and his political instincts will 
make him land on his feet even though the problems are infinitely 
great

hes 84 now a passionate liberal on an 
increasingly conservative supreme court his health is not the 
best but william j brennan says he is having too much fun to 
retire 
im still enjoying myself nothing possibly could be as 
satisfying he told the associated press in an interview days 
before his 84th birthday wednesday 
ive been having some bad health of late i had that doggone 
attack in march that started i thought as influenza now 
thought to have been a more serious bronchial infection they gave 
me some antibiotics and i had a bad reaction lost a lot of 
weight brennan said they told me it might be as long as three 
months before i finally get fully recovered from it 
but retire if i can keep on the way i am im going to 
stay he said 
his stay to date has lasted 34 years and transcended the 
administrations of eight presidents 
in the courts history only one justice william o douglas 
wrote more opinions only three court members served at more 
advanced ages oliver wendell holmes at 91 roger taney at 87 and 
hugo black at 85 
few have written with such literary grace and eloquence 
appointed by president dwight d eisenhower brennan helped lead 
a liberal revolution in american law through the 1960s the 
protection of individual rights was elevated to new heights 
some called brennan an ideologue and an activist some called 
him a champion of the underdog 
in a 1987 law school speech he said when i think of the 
progress we have made over the last 30 years i look upon our 
system of civil liberties with some satisfaction and a certain 
pride 
gradually his role changed ronald reagans legacy three key 
court appointments has left brennan often outmanned in his fight 
against a nascent conservative counterrevolution 
in recent years the other side has pretty much carried the 
day brennan said that strikes me as nothing to be surprised 
about after all the president fills the vacancies 
in a recent interview published in new yorker magazine brennan 
was quoted as saying im not discouraged to the point of giving 
up i hope people dont overdo the suggestion that were headed for 
perdition 
he added im not going to walk out and say the hell with it 
even in recent years brennan has registered major successes 
some of them prompted daniel popeo of the conservative washington 
legal foundation to state unfortunately i think the man is 
extremely intelligent hes been a key player now under three chief 
justices he deserves professional respect 
brennan told ap of one possible exception to his resolve against 
retirement if the good lord steps in and something happens that 
i wouldnt be able to carry on 
i have a pledge from my wife that the day she notices it 
shell tell me so ill act accordingly he said i think it 
would be so wrong to stay here unless youre fully able to do your 
job too much rides on what we do around here 
among the more than 1200 opinions written by brennan are 
landmarks that imposed a one person one vote standard for 
electing state legislatures created constitutional protections for 
libel lawsuit defendants and helped invent a legal definition of 
obscenity 
new york university law professor burt neuborne evaluating 
brennans opinions and his contribution to the justices 
deliberations once called him the most influential supreme court 
member since john marshall the great chief justice of the early 
19th century 
the comment makes brennan wince 
honestly thats so overstated so overdrawn even the greats 
of the past holmes brandeis theyd never stand for such a 
claim he said 
but retired justice lewis f powell for 15 years brennans 
colleague said in a recent interview i have no doubt he will 
have a high ranking among the courts members bill is one of 
historys great justices 
although far more conservative than brennan in his judicial 
views powell said their professional differences never impaired 
our friendship he is a man of great personal warmth 
reminded of his reputation as a skilled behindthescenes 
coalition builder brennan took exception i dont know who 
invented that you know damn well its not true he said you 
do your best and as often as not when you end up with a majority 
it reflects many ideas of your colleagues and not only yours 
he said the courts members persuade each other in written 
memos not in backroom deals or smokefilled meetings 
a sample of brennans writing style and perhaps his power of 
persuasion was displayed in a speech he wrote to celebrate the 
constitutions 200th birthday 
our entire constitution is a national treasure a document of 
heady ideals and eloquent elegant language a political landmark 
for individual rights he wrote 
but one thing the old parchment is not is a china doll that 
has to be protected from the regular world by a good layer of 
cotton wool it is a tough old soldier thats collected quite a few 
respectable dents in the line of duty

robert taft ii whose family produced a 
president and two us senators with careers spanning most of this 
century has found that being a taft is not what it used to be 
the 48yearold lawyer serving his third fouryear term as a 
hamilton county commissioner in cincinnati abandoned his bid to 
become ohios next governor in february after disappointing 
showings in the polls 
he said his aborted try for the republican gubernatorial 
nomination made him understand that he needs to become better known 
to younger voters 
among those who knew me the reaction was positive taft 
said but there was a number who didnt know the family name 
among those who knew the name many dont know who i am 
taft is now running unopposed in the may 8 gop primary for 
secretary of state leaving former cleveland mayor george voinovich 
unopposed for the gop gubernatorial nomination 
it has been 20 years since a taft won a statewide election 
although the family name was on the ballot in 1976 1982 and 1986 
james wray political director for the white house said that 
while the taft family made a tremendous contribution to the gop 
and the nation taft will have to work to increase his name 
recognition 
hes going to have to get out there and identify himself 
wray said 
james ruvolo ohios democratic chairman said taft is not well 
known outside of cincinnati 
the name is not the drawing card it once was ruvolo said 
taft quit the governors race after party contributors balked at 
funding a costly battle between him and voinovich his switch to 
the secretary of states race will pit him in november against 
twoterm incumbent democrat sherrod brown who is unopposed in his 
partys primary 
voinovich state chairman robert bennett and other party leaders 
praised taft as a team player whose willingness to change races 
reflected his familys party loyalty 
tafts father robert jr served three terms in the us house 
before his election to the senate in 1970 he was defeated in a 
reelection bid in 1976 
robert jrs father robert a was known as mr republican 
while serving in the senate from 1939 to 1953 he sought the gop 
presidential nomination in 1952 against dwight eisenhower 
william howard taft father of robert a and greatgrandfather 
of robert taft ii served from 1909 to 1913 as the 27th president 
and then became us chief justice 
in 1982 seth taft of cleveland a businessman and distant 
cousin of robert jr ran for the gop nomination for governor 
finishing second in a field of four 
robert taft ii became involved in politics when he helped his 
father get elected to the senate he served in the peace corps and 
was a state department aide in vietnam 
taft served in the ohio house for two terms from 1976 to 1980 
he ran for lieutenant governor in 1986 as the running mate of 
former fourterm gov james a rhodes who tried to make a comeback 
at age 77 but lost to democratic incumbent gov richard celeste 
i think i got some visibility in 1986 but rhodes was the 
issue taft said it was difficult to emerge clearly 
last year taft decided to head his own ticket in the race to 
succeed celeste who ends his second consecutive fouryear term in 
january and is barred by law from seeking a third taft announced 
his candidacy in june and insisted through most of the year that he 
was in the race to stay 
but among a lot of voters particularly maybe younger voters 
maybe there wasnt a lot of awareness built up i had never been 
involved on my own in a statewide campaign he said 
tafts exit from the gubernatorial race sparked rumors that a 
deal was cut for a future party endorsement perhaps for the us 
senate in 1992 when democratic incumbent john glenns term expires 
taft denied having plans beyond this year i think in 
politics its a mistake to look beyond the office you are 
seeking he said

with the two germanys moving toward unification 
here is a chronicle of a dark period in world war ii the war that 
led to the division of germany in the first place it was 50 years 
ago this month that adolf hitlers forces blitzed across western 
europe forcing the heroic evacuation of more than 300000 allied 
troops at dunkirk and france collapsed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the stalemate in europe ended sitzkrieg became blitzkrieg 
fifty years ago next thursday at dawn on may 10 1940 adolf 
hitler blew the whistle and for the second time in nine months let 
loose the full force of his dogs of war 
on the same day almost by acclamation winston churchill was 
called on to be prime minister of great britain 
during the winter german forces had taken norway and denmark 
almost as military exercises adding them to the bulging nazi sack 
with poland czechoslovakia and austria 
now hitlers targets were the low countries the netherlands 
belgium and luxembourg all neutrals all assured repeatedly of 
germanys peaceful intent 
in five days he leveled rotterdam and crushed holland sending 
queen wilhemina and the dutch government into exile in britain but 
holland was only a battle in passing 
his steel phalanxes spearheaded by stuka dive bombers and 
paratroopers next turned to belgium having breached the steep 
banks of the meuse across four bridgeheads poured an armored 
assault the likes of which europe had never seen before 
german tanks in three columns a hundred miles long roared and 
clanked through sedan shattering two french armies in a dash 
toward the english channel cleaving the allied forces in half 
trapping the best of the british and french divisions in belgium to 
the north 
tactically the germans uncorked one innovation after another 
special task forces were assigned specific targets fortresses and 
bridges and delivered by parachute and glider for this they had 
practiced on replica targets in germany the previous winter 
the formidable fort eben emael was a case in point it was the 
strongest fortress in all of europe a steel and concrete bastion 
dug deep into belgian soil heavily armored with gun turrets and 
manned by 1200 men 
the german assault was mounted by a task force of 80 men 
commanded by a sergeant and borne to the fort by nine gliders that 
landed on the roof 
specially made hollow explosives knocked out the gun turrets 
spreading gas and flame everywhere flamethrowers were then turned 
against every aperture essentially blinding the fortress 
panzer units and dive bombers finished the job a white flag was 
posted at noon of the 11th the fortress had fallen in 30 hours of 
the 80man task force there were only six killed and 19 wounded 
it presaged what would happen to frances vaunted maginot line 
on the second day of the advance german commanders felt the 15 
divisions and six in reserve of the sixth army in the north could 
fend off any attack by the 24 british and french divisions and the 
15 belgian divisions facing it to the south they greatly 
outnumbered the allied forces 
a week after the invasion of holland the german forces were 
rolling across undefended french countryside churchill was 
astounded to discover the french had committed all their reserves 
and were essentially broken 
although his generals were confident hitler himself was a 
bundle of nerves he expected a french counterattack that would 
isolate his armies his caution was clearly uncalled for 
he authorized a reconnaisance in force and with that 
permission seven armored divisions pressed westward and by may 19 
were only 50 miles from the channel 
the next day the second panzer division had reached the mouth of 
the somme river and the british expeditionary force three french 
armies and the belgians were trapped 40 divisions in all the 
formerly worried hitler was overjoyed 
then came an incredible series of events 
the french chose this moment to change commanders and precious 
time was lost leaving little chance to move south and break out of 
the german circle of fire and steel 
by the 24th the allies had their backs to the channel the 
germans were in sight of dunkirk evacuation by sea was the only 
option left 
then at the edge of victory hitler ordered his panzers to 
stop probably in a bow to the luftwaffe and hermann goering who 
wanted his heinkels and messerschmitts to finish the allies off or 
perhaps he thought of conserving his army 
the british smelling defeat had been gathering all kinds of 
boats anything that could make it across the channel churchill 
ordered all noncombatants taken off first meanwhile the 
belgians holding the northern rim of the dunkirk peimeter were 
beginning to weaken

on the evening of may 26 the british ordered up the hastily 
designed operation dynamo the first british troops most of them 
from heavily hit divisions were home that night plucked from port 
and beach by the makeshift flotilla 
the british searched boatyards for motorboats and launches 
yanked lifeboats from liners at london docks mobilized tugs from 
the thames and called into service barges and pleasure craft 
fishing boats and small coastal steamers on the night of may 27 
this second fleet headed toward dunkirk 
in all 400 small vessels joined the british navy an armada 
that eventually numbered 860 craft churchill noticed that some of 
his own staff were mysteriously absent as all of england 
established a lifeline to its stricken troops 
at first the huddled british and french were pummeled by the 
luftwaffe but gradually the royal air force eroded their numbers 
wrote churchill to and from between the shore and the ships 
plied the little boats gathering the men from the beaches as they 
waded out or picking them from the water with total indifference 
to the air bombardmenttheir numbers alone defied air attack the 
mosquito armada as a whole was unsinkable in the midst of our 
defeat glory came to the island people united and unconquerable 
it continued until june 4 beyond the point anyone thought the 
rear guard could hold out in the end more than 338000 troops 
were rescued including 60000 of the 100000 french left on the 
beaches and docks of dunkirk were 7000 tons of ammunition 90000 
rifles 2300 artillery pieces 82000 vehicles 8000 bren guns 
and 400 antitank rifles but the men were saved to fight again 
to rearm them the united states went to its military 
warehouses and sold the defeated allies 500000 world war i rifles 
900 french 75 field guns and 80000 machine guns it left the 
arsenal of democracy with weaponry for only 18 million men 
while the dunkirk evacuation proceeded king leopold iii 
against the advice of his government and with the shortest possible 
notice to his allies surrendered belgium to the germans on may 28 
on june 5 the day after dunkirk fell hitler turned his full 
attention to the 65 french divisions and less than two british 
divisions in the south to that task he unleashed 143 divisions 10 
of them armored 
on june 10 the french government fled to bordeaux and four days 
later german troops raised the swastika over the eiffel tower the 
french asked for armistice but hitler said he would have to 
consult first with italian dictator benito mussolini who now felt 
he could join the party on june 11 he ordered his 32 divisions to 
attack on the alpine front after a week of fighting they had not 
been able to advance against six french divisions 
on the afternoon of june 21 at compiegne where the germans had 
surrendered to the allies in world war i william l shirer author 
of the rise and fall of the third reich watched as hitler read 
the inscription on the memorial plaque that said 
here on the eleventh of november 1918 succumbed the criminal 
pride of the german empire vanquished by the free peoples which 
it tried to enslave 
about hitler on that day shirer wrote i have seen that face 
many times at the great moments of his life but today it is afire 
with scorn anger hate revenge triumph suddenly as though 
his face were not giving quite complete expression to his feelings 
he throws his whole body into harmony with his mood he swiftly 
snaps his hands on his hips arches his shoulders plants his feet 
wide apart it is a magnificent gesture of defiance of burning 
contempt for this place now and all that it has stood for in the 22 
years since it witnessed the humbling of the german empire 
seventeen days earlier before the house of commons as the 
dunkirk evacuation ended churchill directed himself to the free 
world in a onesentence pledge that will never be forgotten 
even though large tracts of europe and many old and famous 
states have fallen or may fall into the grip of the gestapo and all 
the odious apparatus of nazi rule we shall not flag or fail we 
shall go on to the end we shall fight in france we shall fight in 
the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and 
growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever 
the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on 
the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the 
streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender and 
even if which i dont for a moment believe this island or a large 
part of it were subjugated or starving then our empire beyond the 
seas armed and guarded by the british fleet would carry on the 
struggle until in gods good time the new world with all its 
power and might steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the 
old

when les tyler talks about his rescue from 
dunkirk the story is told with music and tears 
tyler was a 20yearold private in the british army in may 1940 
as he waited under enemy fire and prayed for a boat to save him 
from the advancing german guns 
he had been shot in the arm during fierce fighting near arras 
belgium and was sent to a medical station for evacuation but 
while awaiting transport home he was instructed to retreat to 
dunkirk on foot it was every man for himself 
burrowed between the sheltering dunes wounded and watching 
other young men dying all around him tyler had some doubts he 
would survive 
but im not the kind of person to give up easily says 
tyler 71 instead of giving up i get a tune in my head 
so while the bullets blazed around him and his comrades watched 
the sea and prayed tyler took out a harmonica and played 
i played everything i knew tyler recalls and the more 
scared i got the harder i played 
i played roll out the barrel and pack up your troubles in 
an old kit bag pieces from operettas and marching songs and over 
and over vera lynns white cliffs of dover 
often during his twoday wait tyler thought hed never see the 
familiar cliffs again german stuka fighters screamed overhead 
strafing and bombing the beach bullets struck the sand inches 
away he wanted to go home 
it just made me so angry to be stuck there only a few miles 
from dover he says every time a plane came over i shot at it 
even though i knew it was impossible to hit with a rifle i was 
just so mad 
just across the english channel a huge armada of ships large 
and small was assembling for the dunkirk evacuation 
we were told ships would come he recalls it was chaos 
more and more men were joining us all the time lads were spread 
out along the sand as far as you could see 
tylers narrative stops as his eyes fill with tears and he 
chokes back a sob his wife helps fill gaps in the story 
all along the road were terrified french refugees fleeing 
advancing german troops 
i had been separated from my unit the northamptonshire 
regiment tyler says so while i was with a crowd on the road 
and beach i was all alone and knew no one 
toward dusk at the end of the second day the little ships 
finally appeared on the horizon i thought thank god 
but it was still a long while before he set sail for home he 
spent hours standing in neckdeep waves a short man tyler had 
trouble keeping head above water he lost his rifle some men gave 
up in exhaustion sank and drowned german planes continued their 
murderous fire 
long after dark tyler finally was pulled aboard a commercial 
ferry the ss canterbury later he learned that of the 1000 men in 
his regiment only 20 survived 
historians say the evacuation from dunkirk was the key to the 
war saving the lives of 338000 men needed to fight later battles 
but tyler was sent to mine coal in surrey for the duration of world 
war ii 
he became a railroad guard now retired he is president of the 
dover branch of the dunkirk veterans association 
dunkirk was not tylers last war he was sent to korea captured 
in the battle of imjim river and survived two years in the prisoner 
of war camp at chong song 
im not the kind of person to give up easily tyler says

a flotilla of hundreds of vessels will 
sail across the english channel in a reenactment of the dramatic 
rescue of more than 300000 allied troops trapped on the beaches of 
dunkirk 50 years ago 
the voyage in late may will kick off a summer of exhibits 
concerts and parties commemorating the evacuation 
at least 5000 veterans are expected in belgium england and 
france for events ranging from a quiet service in a military 
cemetery to a beer bash in a nato airport hangar 
a few of the veterans already are in their 90s some are coming 
from as far away as australia organizers are hoping to make the 
commemoration worth the trip for the vets and for the thousands of 
history buffs and tourists who also will be on hand 
some people regard dunkirk as a defeat but for us it was the 
beginning of a bigger victory says lucien pelfrene who was 11 
at the time of the evacuation and now is helping organize events in 
de panne belgium 
for us these men are heroes and will be welcomed here just as 
they were at the liberation 
about onethird of the 338000 men evacuated were taken from 
beaches at de panne about 20 miles from dunkirk 
cafe and bar owners in the belgian resort will compete may 25 to 
see who can make their establishment look most like a traditional 
english pub fireworks will light the sky over the english channel 
and military music will fill the air 
on may 28 after a day of commemorative ceremonies at town hall 
and on the beach veterans and their friends will dance to 1940s 
swing in an enormous hangar at natos koksyde airbase nearby 
fireworks parades and concerts by military bands also are 
planned in dunkirk but the centerpiece of the commemoration will 
be the arrival of the socalled little ships 
about 70 of the original boats will sail out of dovers 
wellington docks on may 24 escorted by the modern naval frigate 
hms alacrity and hundreds of modern boats 
everybody who owns a boat wants to sail along says chris 
lean an organizer of the events and the director of tourism for 
the dover district council 
it will be spectacular he says on a clear day you can 
see france from the cliffs and on that day you will see a huge 
flotilla of fishing boats yachts paddle steamers ferries boats 
of all kinds sailing across the channel 
the boats will dock for three days in dunkirk then they will 
form a circle into which a helicopter will drop a wreath 
exhibition flying teams from england and france will do flyovers 
during the events 
dovers events will extend through july and include concerts 
dances a harborside exhibit on the evacuation and the opening of 
an unusual historic site under dovers imposing 12th century norman 
castle 
more than a mile of cavernous tunnels carved into the chalky 
white cliffs in napoleonic times will open to the public on may 14 
sections of these tunnels were the headquarters for operation 
dynamo the code name for the evacuation 
visitors to the tunnels can stand on the same 500foot high 
vantage point overlooking dover harbor where winston churchill 
looked across to his helpless troops under fire 
the tunnels begun in the early 1800s saw their finest hour as 
viceadmiral bertram ramsey and his staff worked nonstop 200 feet 
below ground planning the miraculous nineday evacuation

montanas prison has had chronic overcrowding currently 1100 
prisoners are in a facility designed for 744 state law allows 
early eligibility for parole when the prison exceeds capacity for 
more than 30 days 
oregon has released prisoners early for years the state also 
has a rotating bunk system whereby an inmate is released for seven 
days while another takes his bunk when the first inmate returns 
someone else is released for a week 
in april 1989 the georgia board of pardons and paroles began an 
emergency early release of 3000 prisoners to avert a threatened 
federal lawsuit georgias prisons were about 110 percent over 
capacity with 4000 state prisoners backed up in county jails by 
september 1989 it had dropped to 40 percent over capacity with 
1400 prisoners backed up 
however while the release program was going on georgia still 
recorded a 48 percent increase in prisoners in the first six 
months of 1989 reaching 20000 prisoners and climbing 
under the pops program 200 tulane university law students are 
compiling medical and legal histories of all louisiana inmates 55 
and older 
louisiana has 799 prisoners who are 60 or older says martha 
jumonville of the department of corrections as of december 1989 
1989 prisoners faced sentences of life 266 faced 99 years and 
928 faced between 35 and 98 years 
other than medical furloughs for the severely disabled there 
are no special provisions for releasing the elderly or impaired 
jumonville says 
less than 10 medical furloughs have been granted in the past 
year prison officials say to qualify a prisoner must be 
recommended by the warden and medical staff and must be permanently 
incapacitated or expected to die within six months says jane 
bankston a consultant to the secretary of corrections 
they must also have someone who agrees to care for them and pay 
all their medical expenses says deputy warden richard peabody 
prisoners eligible for parole may apply for consideration every 
six months because most of the elderly inmates were sentenced 
without the possibility of parole they must first apply for a 
pardon which can only be done once a year and must be approved by 
the governor if granted 
the average expense for medical care and maintenance for inmates 
over 55 is 69000 a year about three times the average for other 
inmates turley says 
the costs of keeping these men in prison is staggering 
turley says the suffering it inflicts on the elderly prisoner 
who cant get proper care and lives in fear of younger inmates is 
appalling

dont look now but dancers are starting to 
touch each other again a generation that grew up on rock n roll 
and disco is learning the pleasures of swaying to the rhythms of 
sweet ballroom music and its not just the older folks say dance 
instructors who are cashing in on the trend 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the brazilian lambada dance craze may 
be the fad in some circles but a resurgence of oldfashioned 
ballroom dancing is also sweeping couples back into each others 
arms 
thats sweet music for dance school operators who stand to 
benefit the most 
people are turning away from the loud noise and that sort of 
thing says richard stephenson author of the complete book of 
ballroom dancing 
they would like to get back into other types of dancing but 
the problem is they dont know any other type of dancing 
there are plenty of people willing to teach them across the 
nation local adult education programs are trying to meet the 
demands for more and more classes in this ohio river city two 
west virginians recently opened the academy of ballroom dance 
the market is everywhere says rebecca richardson coowner 
of the huntington academy if people go out and see the chacha 
or the rumba they like it they dont know what it is but they 
like it 
its ballroom dancing 
americas departure from ballroom dancing is blamed in part on 
rock n roll music and the 60s movement away from tradition it 
was downright difficult to try ballroom moves to a rockin buddy 
holly tune and it became gauche for men to lead a dance during the 
womens movement 
women found that they wanted to be able to stand alone says 
tom cyrus ms richardsons partner 
but alas romance has reentered the picture 
ballroom dancing was also hurt by flybynight dance hall 
instructors who insisted that 80yearold widows needed 20 years 
worth of lessons 
there always was some demand for ballroom dance lessons during 
the rock and disco years but nothing like there is today ms 
richardson says 
its not 70yearolds going to clubs bringing back ballroom 
dancing she says its the younger people 
stephenson wrote his book with a connecticut dance instructor in 
1980 after noting a resurgence in ballroom dancing on their college 
campus 
one of the house mothers called him and suggested he come over 
to her dorm stephenson says they were having a waltz party 
dancing on the carpet in the old dormitory 
stephenson still sells about 3000 copies of the hardcover book 
each year he says 
ballroom dancing involves intricate balance says dancer and 
choreographer marge champion 
its no fun to dance unless you really have a partner who you 
can counterbalance with says champion who with her husband 
gower worked on broadway and toured clubs and television shows in 
the 40s and 50s 
dave and anne griffin of huntington recently glided sputtered 
then glided again through their fourth dance lesson 
griffin had a few lessons as a youngster but mrs griffin had 
never touched a dance floor in a formal setting 
all i ever did was what all college kids do go to the local 
joint and do whatever everyone else was doing she says 
griffin who was formerly in law school and now is finishing 
medical school says that in some socialbusiness circles knowing 
how to dance is an asset 
i muddled around out there and hoped that nobody would 
notice he says most of the time i sat on the side 
stephenson who also has written two chemical engineering 
textbooks cites the romantic benefits 
a lot of people who meet in the dance classes end up getting 
married he says the types of kids youre going to meet in the 
dance class are probably a lot more compatible than ones youre 
going to meet at bars and lounges 
many high schools have turned gymnasiums used for physical 
education classes into temporary dance halls with teachers 
breaking out square dance or waltz records and telling students to 
pair up 
stephenson says the teachers are trying to teach proper behavior 
students now realize this is an important way to interact with 
the opposite sex he says some students were so hung up that 
if they put their arm around their partner it was an invitation to 
go to bed with them 
but dancing is just supposed to be fun says elsa clemensen of 
ashland ky who at 87 is the huntington ballroom dance 
academys oldest student 
i want to dance like those girls in the beautiful dresses on 
tv she says

the industrialized east is not known as a haven 
for wildlife and big game but pennsylvania is taking pains to 
preserve a herd of elk as a natural legacy and a tourist 
attraction its one of only two such herds east of the mississippi 
river 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the thumping of the hovering helicopter 
shatters the tranquillity of the rugged landscape in northcentral 
pennsylvania sending a herd of female elk and their offspring 
scrambling along a hillside 
about 50 yards away a bull elk suddenly appears 1000 pounds 
of muscle and nearly 4 feet of sweeping antlers 
hes coming to protect them the pilot says over the headset 
as the chopper hovers briefly above the treetops 
indeed the dominant bulls presence appears to calm the other 
elk as the helicopter slowly circles the ridge on a sunny afternoon 
similar scenes are played out whenever crews from the 
pennsylvania game commission and the bureau of forestry conduct the 
annual census of pennsylvanias small but stable elk herd 
at last count the news was good there are 154 elk here the 
most since the count was started in the early 1970s through most 
of the last decade the herd ranged between 120 and 140 animals 
in colonial times elk roamed across much of the state but 
development an expanding population and commercial hunting made 
the native elk extinct in the state by 1867 
the roots of the current herd can be traced to 1913 when the 
game commission placed some rocky mountain elk in northcentral 
pennsylvania and in the pocono mountains region of the northeast 
the pocono herd died out leaving the only elk in the state 
confined to about a 200squaremile area in elk and cameron 
counties 
there are major concentrations of elk in the western united 
states where hunting them is popular but pennsylvania has one of 
only two herds east of the mississippi the largest concentration 
of elk in the east is in michigan 
bill drake of the game commission who supervised the census 
from a hangar at saint marys airport says for pennsylvanians 
elk are pretty impressive theyre not only large but theyre 
graceful and theyre beautiful 
the small size of the states elk range allows the searchers to 
concentrate their efforts but without snow getting an accurate 
count is impossible even though an elk is five or more times 
larger than the more common whitetailed dee the elk stand out 
against a backdrop of snow and their tracks and beds are easier to 
spot but the rest of the year their coats of brown and tan blend 
with the forest floor 
last year unseasonably warm weather prompted cancellation of 
the census this year some snow aided visibility at the start of 
the week but it was melting quickly so the crews had to step up 
the pace 
drake plotted the progress on a big wall map keeping in touch 
with the crews by radio and telephone its not easy there was an 
unconfirmed report that three large male elk were parading in a 
field several miles away they need to be confirmed by game wardens 
before they can be added to the count 
is there anything we can do to find those three drake asks 
we can use every elk we can find 
he predicted 171 but was resigned to the fact that the actual 
count would fall far short 
it is frustrating for instance one ground crew reported 
finding three fresh beds but saw only two bull elk they debated 
for a few minutes before drake quietly but firmly said he wouldnt 
count an elk that nobody saw 
the census also counts the number of elk that have died in an 
average year 13 animals die in 1989 the mortality count was 10 
five including one found with its antlers removed with a chain 
saw were killed illegally two were klled by farmers because their 
crops were being destroyed one died of unknown causes and one a 
goliathlike victim of a much smaller foe died of malnutrition 
with porcupine quills in its mouth 
hunters are not allowed to kill elk in pennsylvania but drake 
and others acknowledge a limited hunt is not out of the question at 
some point in the future they are quiet about it in the early 
1980s when the commission publicly said a hunt might be held 
farmers and poachers jumped the gun twentysix elk were killed 
illegally in one year 
they thought if we had trouble with too many elk theyd 
handle it locally rather than let people come in and hunt from 
outside the county drake said thats what we think happened 
a local elk committee has been set up to keep farmers sportsmen 
and the game commission informed of illegal kills to draw elk away 
from farmland some public land has been clearcut to provide food 
for the herd 
the herd has become a tourist attraction in recent years and 
mark rupprecht owner of elk county ammo and arms knows where they 
gather 
in the fall for instance motorists can see as many as 60 elk 
in a field just outside town theres a lot of traffic out 
there rupprecht said its hard to get a parking space 
drake adds if we can maintain elk its kind of an indication 
that we still have some areas in pennsylvania that have a pristine 
quality of environment

ted danson like many people raised near 
inland deserts finds himself irresistibly drawn to the oceans 
and his love affair with the sea which began with boyhood 
visits from his home in arizona is reflected in a new cable tv 
series 
danson best known as the star of nbcs cheers is host and 
narrator of challenge of the seas now appearing weekly on the 
arts amp entertainment channel 
he isnt abandoning cheers yet at least before another 
season but he says the end is near 
the 26week aampe series examines the role that the oceans and 
their inhabitants play in the balance of the earths ecology 
you cant separate the oceans from the rest of the world 
danson says nor can you talk about the oceans without talking 
about the rain forests or any other part of the world the oceans 
are a metaphor everything you put into the air or into the ground 
ends up in the ocean 
he was asked to host the series because of his work with the 
american oceans campaign an environmentalist group he helped 
organize three years ago 
hardy jones and his wife julia whittey came to see me he 
says theyre divers and documentary filmmakers he produced it 
and wrote it and stars in the show with his wife they have some 
absolutely amazing underwater footage 
down in baja in the sea of cortez they dove with hundreds of 
hammerhead sharks the bubbles from the air tanks drove off the 
sharks so they did free diving to 100 feet to get their pictures 
one of the reasons i wanted to do this is that hardy filmed 
unbelievable pictures of fish and animals in their natural habitat 
its more than just a nature film it shows that what we do on land 
impacts on the sea around us 
dansons wife casey and environmental attorney robert sulnick 
are cofounders of the american oceans campaign which has offices 
in santa monica and washington 
our purpose is to preserve and restore our oceans danson 
says thats a pretty broad statement but we are working on 
three programs they are curtailing offshore oil drilling stopping 
coastal pollution and outlawing international drift nets 
some of those drift nets are 50 miles long and they can sweep 
an area the size of ohio every night the nets kill everything in 
their path and if they break loose they float around forever 
killing fish 
upcoming episodes of the series will deal with such subjects as 
dolphins sea lions gray whales sea otters hammerhead sharks 
undersea volcanoes the miledeep canyon near the bahamas sea 
birds marine sanctuaries and parks and kelp beds 
although danson grew up in arizona where his father was an 
archaeologist in the summer the family vacationed in california 
a visit to the ocean was like a pilgrimage he says 
danson just recovered from a case of chickenpox picked up from 
his children is back at work at paramount studios to complete a 
twopart episode wrapping up the eighth season of cheers 
ill be back for another season but after that well have to 
see he says kirstie alley calls me waffle boy because i 
change my mind daily about continuing the show but its getting 
close to the end 
despite his success in such theatrical movies as dad 
cousins and three men and a baby danson has no plans to 
abandon television 
in my mind it makes sense to stay in television he says 
if i werent as successful in films id probably go into it more 
just to raise my batting average its hard to say goodbye to a 
group as good as ours at cheers people are still watching 
danson has also launched another new television series nbcs 
down home he is one of the executive producers 
down home stars judith ivey as a woman who returns after 
several years in new york to her hometown in texas to help her 
father save his small baitandtackle business 
danson and ivey met when they costarred in the tv movie we 
are the children in africa 
next up for danson is three men and a little lady the 
sequel to the hit comedy movie tom selleck steve guttenberg and 
nancy travis as the mother will also reprise their roles leonard 
nimoy directed three men and a baby but he is working on 
another project so emile ardolino dirty dancing will direct

buffeted by the recent death of its god and 
a drop in donations the commune of the late freelove guru osho 
rajneesh is trying to save itself by going mainstream 
emphasis has shifted from mystical sex to meditation exercises 
primal screaming was banned after neighbors complained of the 
noise deals have been signed with prominent companies for 
distribution of video cassettes 
we are mellowing said swami tatahgat an indian board 
member of rajneesh foundation the trust that controls the commune 
before we used to wear our rebelliousness on our sleeves 
it appears to be a kinder gentler commune now than at 
rajneeshpuram ore where according to commune residents and 
spokesmen for the poona press office members administered 
barbiturates and other drugs to rivals they considered 
negative rajneesh called himself bhagwan or god in those 
days 
no longer do disciples prance halfnaked through the halls of 
the local fivestar hotel the blue diamond the hotel recently 
welcomed them back but only for meals 
the lush 11acre campus with its miniature waterfalls outdoor 
japanese restaurant and hightech workout rooms seems more like a 
summer camp for adults than a focus for worldwide revolution in 
consciousness 
all visitors are required to produce the results of an aids test 
no more than a month old westerners seen groping at one anothers 
bodies on poonas streets may get a talking to by other followers 
osho mediatatio is taught at the tata management school a poona 
business college the commune has a contract with cbsindia 
to distribute videotapes of rajneeshs lectures and another with 
pocket books to publish his writings

day breaks at the osho international commune 
disciples gather for a meditation session in lao tzu hall where 
the gurus ashes are housed in a small vault kept on his marble bed 
pattering into the house they pass through a marble room 
furnished only with a plush dental chair 
this is where osho had his teeth fixed swami subhuti a 
commune spokesman intones reverently he used to be peter waight 
a newspaper reporter in london 
inside the mausoleum once rajneeshs bedroom disciples move 
close to the vault containing his ashes never born never

osho rajneesh the mesmerizing guru of quickfix enlightenment 
died jan 19 at the height of his popularity the 58yearold 
former teacher of sanskrit amassed 500000 followers 87 rolls 
royces diamondstudded watches and gowns fashioned from gold 
thread 
rajneesh started his movement in india in the late 1960s 
preaching a blend of eastern mysticism free love and pop 
psychology among his 650 works are such titles as take it easy 
vols i and ii and yahoo 
he changed his name numerous times adopting bhagwan zorba the 
buddha and finally osho the one the heavens shower with 
flowers 
in the early 1980s rajneesh moved his band of redrobed 
followers to a 64229acre ranch in the hills of central oregon 
rancho rajneesh disbanded after the master was kicked out of the 
united states in 1985 for immigration fraud and the american 
movement degenerated into a miasma of poisonings and costly court 
cases 
ma anand sheela rajneeshs former chief aide was sentenced to 
4 years in prison for arson attempted murder and masterminding a 
foodpoisoning outbreak that made 750 townspeople ill other aides 
avoided prosecution by cooperating with police 
rajneesh advocated breaking with all social conventions through 
meditation as he defined it 
through meditation he said his followers could destroy the 
family the church and the state structures he said were 
destroying humanity 
he developed or synthesized several techniques including one in 
which followers jump up and down yelling hoo hoo hoo 
unlike gurus who demanded that disciples reject worldly goods 
rajneesh encouraged his followers to revel in sensual pleasures 
including sex drugs and good food 
only by this way will you ever rise above them he said in 
one of his famous discourses which he peppered with bathroom humor 
and intriguing riddles 
those who succeeded in meditation the guru said would attain 
buddhahood or enlightenment they would be able to live in the 
world unaffected by its changes 
what osho taught is that the next jump for humanity is not 
changing the shape of your nose or face but changing the shape of 
your inner space said swami amrito a british doctor who was 
with rajneesh when he died 
rajneesh returned to india in 1986 and problems followed the 
movement home 
after his death the indian press speculated that rajneesh was 
murdered or died of aids his followers denied the claims and 
accused the united states of poisoning their god while he was in 
jail 
indian newspapers claimed westerners were trying to seize 
control of the movement the commune also rejected that claim 
a mysterious team of 21 people called the inner circle 
runs the commune an american swami jayesh and the british 
doctor swami amrito are believed to be in charge 
negative publicity has hurt donations which routinely reached 
millions of dollars a year 
swami tatahgat the indian board member said the commune did 
not plan to expand its campus because we dont have the funds 
last year the commune lost a court case and was forced to pay the 
indian government 2 million in back taxes

be there or be square says a californian with pigs riding 
surfboards on his shorts 
the meeting of the white robed brotherhood is the centerpiece of 
meditation at the commune every evening hundreds of followers don 
cotton robes and gather in the gautama the buddha auditorium 
disciples pass a metal detector then a duo of sniffing women 
whose job it is to detect those who are wearing perfume or havent 
bathed 
osho doesnt like weird smells says one olfactory guard 
like other followers she speaks of rajneesh in the present tense 
his empty chair sits on a marble stage between two air 
conditioners set at 52 degrees fahrenheit his preferred 
temperature 
a screen drops and a video of the master is shown 
as the discourse ends a young frenchwoman whispers he is 
still with us

spring came for alfredo mustelier on march 21 
after two decades as a prisoner he was free 
free prison uniform meaning he had to live in his undershorts 
prisoners like mustelier who refuse the prison regimen are 
called plantados or steadfast ones they once were many but 
musteliers release left only two 
frustration and hopelessness so overwhelmed mustelier that he 
took out his rage on his teeth grinding them relentlessly some

enter maria a doctor in havana who was a 28yearold widow in 
1985 
a cousin of mustelier who lived in miami was marias close 
friend the cousin asked her to write mustelier because no one 
else did and to mail him reading material and money for 
incidentals 
she agreed never thinking the relationship would develop 
he never thought about love she said he had had two 
marriages that did not work out he had this idea of dedication to 
the fatherland and he did not think about romance 
i would write every week he would say he looked at the world 
through my eyes i would tell him how things were on the street 
about fashion what i saw on tv 
the affection that developed between us was first a great and 
powerful friendship and later a love developed i didnt think 
he would fall in love with me through letters and of course when 
he told me i was in shock 
for much of their correspondence he had never even seen her 
photograph 
mustelier who is white did not know she was black maria said 
racial issues intrude on personal relationships in cuba although 
not nearly so much as in the united states 
she tried twice to visit him in the prison at santiago 600 
miles from havana but was turned away because she was not a close 
relative 
in the spring of 1987 mustelier and some other inmates were 
moved to a prison in the capital 
she will never forget the day they met june 12 1987 
three months later they were married in a twohour prison 
ceremony with about 20 people in attendance the wedding banquet 
was ice cream soda and snacks 
after that she could see him every 21 days 
each time she said since early morning my heart was 
pounding because i knew i was going to see him 
her husband knew she had no time to eat before the visits so he 
sometimes saved his meager lunch for her 
he would bring me his lunch his piece of chicken his piece 
of meat she said 
on one visit two years ago the male guards stripsearched 
maria and sexually abused her mustelier was enraged and refused to 
eat for 19 days 
in addition to the consequences of hunger strikes mustelier 
said he suffers from the results of cruel treatment 
castro has claimed there never has been an instance of torture 
in more than 31 years of the cuban revolution but here are some of 
musteliers complaints 
for two years he was held in a white cell with nothing but a 
500watt electric bulb the constant glare made him nearsighted 
and the condition is becoming progressively worse 
loud horns blown by guards to keep him from sleeping cost him 
40 percent of his hearing 
his arms and legs bear the scars of bayonet attacks by guards 
and his jaw was broken once musteliers legs still are inflamed 
from the last hunger strike 
he once was handcuffed to two other inmates and placed in a cell 
six feet high six long and three wide if two of them lay 
sidebyside the third had to lie on top because of the handcuffs 
after 24 hours mustelier managed to remove the handcuffs the 
guards threatened to put them back on but he said for you to 
put the chains back on youll have to kill us 
an officer sided with the inmates and although the three were 
kept in the cell several more days they were not handcuffed 
despite his prison ordeal mustelier looks surprisingly healthy 
perhaps younger than his 47 years seven weeks after ending his 
last hunger strike he has gained 40 pounds and worries about 
becoming fat 
if he is embittered he doesnt show it laughter often 
punctuates his stories of life in prison even his description of 
being overrun by roaches and mosquitos 
we used to say they were the big allies of our jailers he 
said 
did he ever count the days during his 105day hunger strike 
no because after counting them you worry and this weighs on 
you he said and laughed again 
yoga and an hour of physical exercise every day helped mustelier 
endure the long confinement like maria he found comfort in 
religion 
in his last hunger strike his rosary was always with him 
he showed a visitor a book of religious verses he had since 
1988 despite daily use it was nearly in mint condition 
he opened the book with great care not touching the pages 
beyond the margins 
every verse filled me with peace and tranquillity he said 
mustelier wrote love poems to maria whom he calls caruca and 
gave her a collection of them in september for their second wedding 
anniversary 
one translated from the spanish reads 
your appearance produces not only happiness but joy 
happiness is a momentary state of emotion joy is a state of 
satisfaction and deep feeling with that i will look upon you as a 
gift of spring

when nissan was ready to market a luxury car it 
wanted a name and a symbol that meant something on both sides of 
the world conveyed its quality and bridged language barriers 
after months of consultation the name infiniti and its symbol an 
unbroken line incorporating a peak emerged 
when american can decided its name no longer fit the character 
and breadth of its financial services and specialty retailing 
business it searched for a new one it ultimately became 
primerica with a logotype characterized by two merging typefaces 
that mirror the companys diversity 
both companies used corporate identity consultants to analyze 
and execute the changes 
naming names has become vital business in the era of mergers and 
global expansion and many companies are using these specialists to 
help them establish or reestablish their persona in the 
marketplace 
it has achieved a level of recognition that it never had 
before says clive chajet chairman and chief executive officer 
of lippincott amp margulies probably the leading corporate identity 
firm and the one which created the infiniti and primerica names 
he says the growing field is lucrative for people who have a 
curious blend of qualifications intellectual discipline 
creativity hardnosed business sense diplomatic skills 
seasoning and patience they might find places at lampm or its 
competitors which include anspach grossman portugal inc landor 
associates and siegal amp gale identity specialists are found on 
many corporate staffs as well 
corporate identity people get involved in such diverse functions 
as naming or branding logotypes and print design market analyses 
and research mission statements and overall strategy chajet sums 
it up as creative intellectually strategic planning 
the mission he says is to define an identity that conveys what 
kind of company it is to work for what its place in the market is 
and its value in the stock market you dont do this simply 
because the company wants to decorate itself 
field professionals fall into three main categories usually 
working in concert consultants designers and name people 
a name person is a very special breed of person chajet 
says these are people who love words who love to sit around and 
dream up names the challenge may be to put a great deal of 
meaning and information into one simple word most companies today 
need names that are internationally recognizable names also must 
be available for copyright not a small problem since 80000 new 
names are registered each year 
then there is the designer who may work primarily with 
typography but whose duties will extend to laying down usage 
formulas for logotypes stationery publications or product 
branding our designers have to succeed in a very narrow graphic 
area the type may be limited but it has a major affect on the 
design itself 
and the omniscient consultant he is well educated he is a 
good strategist and he knows how to link what we do to general 
business he is sophisticated he has to have patience and the 
ability to deal with a lot of clients if he has these qualities 
he will be at home here the consultant is at the forefront of 
analyzing a companys mission and conception problems in context of 
its position in the marketplace often he will be involved in 
drawing up internal mission and position statements that clarify 
these for the company 
there arent any schools of corporate identity and except for 
designers staff members usually come in after seasoning elsewhere 
marketing advertising financial writing and other fields the 
late walter margulies cofounder of the firm was an architect 
one of the main attractions of the work is its stimulation 
chajet says the diversity of business you get involved with 
gives you a buzz youre dealing only with the top level of 
management the level of your colleagues is high you have a 
sophisticated lifestyle the subject matter thinking of and 
shaping images is a fascinating subject i call that a big buzz 
steve lawrence vice president of account services at the firm 
agrees we dont have any dog days here the high level of work 
is constant there arent any formulas and each problem needs an 
individual solution the ultimate satisfaction is to provide a 
solution that lasts for a long time 
the variety lets me change jobs every few months adds 
vice president kate moran whose specialty is names and brands she 
says she gets a thrill when she sees the results of her work as she 
travels like an automobile or a company name she helped create 
 
design services director connie birdsall who recently came up 
with a new healthcare symbol for bausch amp lomb products says she 
likes the wonderful problem solving and creating permanent 
designs 
the material rewards are good too according to chajet though 
he wont put a dollar figure on any of the jobs he says 
professionals can earn a nice living and salaries are 
competitive with those in topline advertising and design firms 
unlike some of those firms who may lay off large parts of their 
staffs when they lose accounts the identity field is stable 
our stability for the last eight years has been absolutely 
frightening

a shortage of engineers and scientists has educators and 
potential employers aggressively courting women and minorities 
we need to funnel our brightest students including women and 
minorities into science and engineering to remain competitive 
economically on an international scale says dr harold j 
raveche president of stevens institute of technology in hoboken 
nj 
a shortfall of 400000 recipients of bachelor of science degrees 
and 27000 of doctorates by the year 2000 has been projected by the 
hudson institute in its workforce 2000 report the squeeze is 
being intensified by competition from countries like japan and west 
germany which have about twice as many engineers per capita as the 
united states according to a battelle memorial institute study 
cornell university for one has initiated two new programs to 
find and encourage black high school students and minority college 
freshmen to pursue science and engineering careers too many 
people have accepted the idea that theres no pool from which to 
train the black engineers of the future says judy jackson 
assistant dean of engineering for minority programs we said 
thats ridiculous we went aggressively into five high schools and 
we asked guidance counselors for kids with aptitude we talked to 
every kid who had the potential and chose those who also had the 
desire to reach their potential then we talked to their parents 
little progress has been made in increasing the number of women 
in science and engineering says dr jane butler kahle professor 
of teacher education at miami university in oxford ohio who has 
been studying the problems of women in the profession she thinks 
the reasons include lack of role models a male bias in science 
and inequities in the workplace 
only 14 percent of the countrys scientists and engineers are 
women about the same proportion as 25 years ago she says not 
only are their enrollment rates lower but the attrition rates are 
higher the few who manage to get their degrees and move into the 
workforce face lower pay slower promotion less visibility and 
fewer rewards at work 
armed with a grant from the national science foundation kahle 
investigated high schools around the country to see what they did 
to motivate girls to continue science studies i was tired of 
teacher bashing i wanted to go in and find out what a good teacher 
did 
what she found was that relatively inexpensive changes 
attractive classrooms with plants and animals nonsexist language 
stress on the creativity in science and career advice 
contributed to increased interest not only from girls but boys as 
well this was true even in the innercity school where the room 
was like an island it was just very attractive even though all 
the blinds were ripped and some of the glass was shattered 
raveche agrees that a less sterile image of science will help 
weve got to convey the sense of fun and excitement and the 
relevance of science he adds that high schools and colleges 
need to improve the image and professionalism of math and science 
teachers our society has created a stereotype of the scientist 
as a nerd complete with calculator and pocket protector 
girls should be encouraged not only because the economy will 
need them but because they will benefit themselves kahle says i 
explain to parents that we arent in the schools because we think 
their daughters should be phd scientists but because we think 
its better to earn 10 an hour as a technician rather than 3 an 
hour as a beautician

polymer engineering completely unknown two decades ago is a 
new field for science and engineering graduates 
i get lots of of job descriptions for polymer engineers i 
wish i could fill all the requests i get says ruth walton who 
directs career services at stevens institute of technology in 
hoboken nj stevens is one of the few american colleges that 
teaches polymer engineering a field growing because of development 
of highperformance plastics with new uses in manufacturing 
construction and medicine 
plastics are beginning to be rated as highly as steel glass and 
ceramics as an engineering material says costas gogos chemical 
engineering professor at stevens and new initiatives director of 
its polymer processing institute and in medicine polymers are 
useful because they are inert meaning they do not interact with 
the body that makes them good for implants and intravenous feeding 
devices he says 
stevens placement council estimates that the median starting 
salary after college for chemical engineers including polymer 
specialists at 34699 
the wastemanagement crisis has created a shortage of trained 
environmental and wastemanagement engineers according to a 
cornell university survey of consulting firms in the united states 
and canada 
almost all the 51 firms we surveyed project new employment 
opportunities for environmental and wastemanagement engineers 
says kate skelton research director for the cornell waste 
management institute the number of students preparing to enter 
the field of waste management is far from sufficient to meet 
current and future demands 
wastemanagement engineers oversee plans and strategies for 
dealing with solid municipal industrial hazardous agricultural 
sewage and radioactive wastes these include design siting 
monitoring and construction of handling facilities 
while the firms say that 60 percent of their new hires in the 
past two years have had bachelors degrees most want future 
employees to have masters degrees average starting salaries were 
27518 for the former and 30403 for the latter salaries are 
highest in the northeast and lowest in the southwest and midwest 
skelton says that the demand may even be higher than the survey 
shows we polled only established consulting firms that have 
already carved out their stable share of the market and we know we 
are missing the many new firms entering the field of waste 
management and environmental engineering 
another field with shortages is nuclear pharmacy for dealing 
with radiopharmaceuticals and radioactive drugs used in diagnosing 
diseases like heart conditions and cancer 
limited resources and a lack of qualified teachers have made it 
difficult to start programs in this specialty says stan shaw 
professor of nuclear pharmacy at purdue university in west 
lafayette ind other schools with programs are massachusetts 
college of pharmacy mercer school of pharmacy temple university 
university of kentucky and university of new mexico 
if the student can make it through the college program and has 
genuine interest in nuclear pharmacy he or she should have no 
problem finding a job says steve piepenbrink a nuclear 
pharmacist at syncor international co in indianapolis at 
syncor there are at least 20 positions open throughout the company 
on an ongoing basis a problem faced by nuclear pharmacies 
nationwide 
these drugs are only occasionally used for therapy he says the 
primary use is diagnostic usually the drug is injected 
intravenously into the patient and absorbed into the organ or 
tissue under observation radioactive atoms decay and emit 
radiation that is detected by a gamma camera the drug will appear 
as excessive or small amounts of radioactivity in the tissue or 
organ alerting a doctor to the possibility of disease 
the field will continue to grow says shaw there are many new 
radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis and therapy being developed and 
there will be a bigger challenge to develop resources needed to 
educate students

intensified recruitment special programs and higher salaries 
are being put to work as shortages in nursing and healthcare 
specialties continue 
there were 16 million registered nurses in 1988 according to a 
report recently sent to congress by health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan but the association of academic health 
centers representing about 100 major health complexes in the 
united states estimates that an additional 137000 new nurses are 
needed to fill current vacancies in hospitals and nursing homes 
a recent salary survey by working woman magazine puts the 
national pay average for nurses at between 37000 and 40000 
pace university in new york says the starting salary in the 
metropolitan area is 35000 
paces leinhard school of nursing in westchester county and new 
york city says it is launching an allout effort to find and train 
new nurses recruiting not only in high schools but in other 
disciplines and careers one of its programs is nursing summer camp 
for promising high school candidates in westchester another 
project in cooperation with a group of new york city schools 
enables hospital workers to upgrade their careers through nursing 
education lienhard also has a combined degree program that lets a 
degree holder in one field complete requirements for an initial 
nursing degree in as little as a year 
other healthcare specialties experiencing shortages include 
laboratory technicians dr betty hatten chairman of the 
university of oklahomas clinical laboratory sciences department 
cites a survey that shows that 93 percent of medical technologist 
and 136 percent of cytotechnologist positions across the country 
are vacant 
she says low enrollments overwork burnout and low salary 
growth are among the causes in cytotechnology analysis of cells 
to diagnose cancer and other diseases technicians are restricted 
by new federal rules on how many slides they are allowed to review 
in one day 
genetic counselors according to a representative of sarah 
lawrence college there are only 950 genetic counselors certified 
by the american board of medical genetics more than half of whom 
received their training at the bronxville ny college 
these specialists are involved in screening and diagnosis of 
such disorders as cystic fibrosis muscular dystrophy 
neurofibromatosis or craniofacial disorders they also work with 
families to adjust to the impact of these conditions 
sarah lawrence was the first school in the nation in 1969 to 
establish a masters level program in genetic counseling it has 
established affiliations with more than 30 medical and research 
centers in the metropolitan new york area the college says field 
work placement with leading researchers at area institutions is 
readily available for students with research interests 
optometrists optometry schools reported only 1881 applicants 
for 1214 spaces in 1989 compared to 2022 applicants for 1196 
spaces the previous year according to the american optometric 
association 
aoa says the country needs more and more optometrists as the 
population ages but there are fewer seeking a career in the field 
doctors of optometry are statelicensed to diagnose and treat 
vision conditions and eye disorders they prescribe glasses 
contact lenses special optical devices and in some states drugs 
to treat certain eye diseases specializations within the 
profession include contact lenses vision therapy pediatric or 
geriatric optometry 
aoa says optometrists averaged net incomes of 66000 in 1988 
with an average of more than 40000 during their first full year 
of practice 
support staffs in contrast to healthcare specialists are being 
cut by many hospitals and institutions because of consolidation and 
tighter reimbursement restrictions 
as a result innumerable administrative jobs in clerical 
purchasing and accounting are being automatically eliminated 
says angelo m troisi of lee hecht harrison inc a bostonbased 
outplacement firm he predicts the cutbacks will continue for at 
least five years 
he says that vulnerable healthcare workers should consider 
relocating to urban areas where healthcare needs are greater or 
even changing to other fields already we see a growing number of 
higherlevel administrators moving out of healthcare he says

law school graduates face a dilemma which is the better career 
path small firm or large firm 
the answer pretty much lies within the comfort zone of each 
individual but among those touting the small firm is dean booth 
senior partner of booth wade and campbell a small firm based in 
atlanta 
in a small firm the young lawyer has an opportunity to work 
directly with the partners if he or she is very good that quality 
will easily be recognized says booth in large firms that 
contact is not easily accessible and young lawyers often need a 
mentor in the firm to guide their path to partnership 
booth believes that lawyers in smaller firms are often required 
to engage in a variety of tasks and have more opportunity to 
practice litigation 
advantages often cited for larger firms include security and 
salary 
richard zeif a partner in the small law firm of nierenberg 
zeif and weinstein in new york says he advised his son to seek out 
a large law firm i think his future is more secure with a larger 
firm he says 
booth says the failure rate for large and small firms is about 
the same less than 5 percent each year and financial compensation 
is now comparable

the graying of america and the growth of twocareer families has 
brought renewed momentum to the direct selling industry 
traditionally called doortodoor sales according to specialists 
in the field 
the trend toward nesting by baby boomers is giving the 
industry its greatest boost says elizabeth doherty a 
spokeswomen for the direct sales association an industry trade 
group 
these nesters now in their 30s and 40s are settling down to 
raise their children and are looking to create a healthier balance 
between family and work 
early retirees also are returning to the work force seeking 
extra income to supplement fixed pensions and social security 
according to the trade group there was a decline in the 
nationwide number of direct sales representatives in the mid80s 
but in recent years the trend has been reversed to the point where 
it now is a 97 billion industry employing some 4 million fulland 
parttime sales representatives 
john naisbitt author of megatrends 2000 says women are 
expected to take twothirds of all new jobs created in the 90s 
and of these women mothers will make up the largest percentage 
according to ms doherty the association estimates that 80 
percent of direct sales representatives work part time and 80 
percent of the industry is comprised of women 
because of its time flexibility direct selling has 
historically proven to be a popular career choice with mothers and 
others seeking parttime work she says

here are highlights of opportunities in a variety of fields 
the cio or chief information officer is gaining visibility as 
a senior executive in many corporations says a search consultant 
who specializes in the field 
while some skepticism persists the cio idea a senior 
executive by whatever title in charge of technology on a par with 
the cfo and other toplevel executives is no longer a novelty 
says john j davis who runs an executive search firm in new york 
city 
davis estimates that better than half of the 100 largest 
technologicallydriven corporations have a cio this executive is 
less a technology expert than a business leader who manages 
information technology as an offensive and defensive weapon in a 
companys fight to survive in global markets he says 
the position has real teeth real substance 
the person who plans and manages office environments represents 
a new professional specialty facilities management 
responsibilities include longrange planning and budgeting real 
estate acquisition and disposal planning of interior space 
architectural and engineering planning new construction or 
renovation maintenance and operations management integrating 
communications systems and general administrative services like 
food services reprographics and transportation 
according to the international facility management association 
based in houston and currently claiming 8700 members entry level 
salaries average 2000030000 depending on position company 
size and geographic location the organization says that 22 
colleges offer programs in this area among them cornell 
university iona college north dakota state university and brigham 
young university the massachusetts institute of technology offers 
several courses and hosts a conference each year 
the corporate real estate management field has become central to 
corporate strategy planning industry observers note 
specialists once just caretakers of company holdings must now 
deal with large plant investment decisions that call for knowledge 
of corporate needs government regulations tax structures cost 
factors and worldwide site location criteria according to the 
industrial development research council an association of fortune 
500 corporate real estate professionals 
corporations are placing heavier emphasis on the recruitment of 
specialists who are seasoned in finance foreign and domestic 
dealmaking and strategic thinking according to the council 
employment opportunities are excellent for college business 
graduates who specialize in accounting according to the personnel 
director of one of the nations largest independent regional 
accounting firms 
with the general disenchantment on wall street 
businessminded individuals looking for great career opportunities 
should seriously consider accounting says rick fisher of richard 
a eisner amp co a new yorkbased firm 
although auditing services will always be the backbone of the 
accounting industry fisher says individuals can expect to see 
opportunities in the areas of litigation support bankruptcy 
divorce and white collar crime 
according to the american institute for certified public 
accountants the earnings potential of a cpa is excellent with 
starting salaries as high as 33000 depending on the size of the 
firm the company and the geographical location 
women are making inroads into the life insurance business 
according to a spokesman for northwestern mutual life where one of 
10 sales agents are women 
the lure in this oncemaledominated field is the right mix of 
financial reward and flexibility says john caspari of the firms 
communications department he says the trend for more women in 
sales ranks will continue advanced degrees and prior experience 
while helpful are not a prerequisite he adds 
job opportunities in the welding field are being upgraded by a 
new certification program providing recognition of welders who have 
demonstrated their competence according to the american welding 
society 
the program improves career mobility for welders with 
certification that travels with the individual explains richard 
alley president of the society 
the bureau of labor statistics tells us that we must maintain 
the welder workforce at about 420000 into the 21st century so aws 
developed the welder certification program to provide personal 
credentials that stay with individuals wherever they may want to 
work similar to those available in many other occupations he 
says 
while industry is losing 25 percent of its welders every year 
due to normal attrition nearly 100000 annually we have only 
about 35000 students in secondary education taking welding courses 
today he adds 
many retirees and housewives are choosing second careers as 
school bus drivers says a spokesman for miamibased ryder student 
transportation services 
more than 50 percent of ryders 7500 drivers are women many of 
them mothers of school age children attracted by schedules and 
vacations that coincide with their childrens according to 
jonathan ward 
some even drive their own children to school he adds 
another source of school bus drivers is retirees ward notes 
like housewives retirees are drawn to school bus driving by 
the opportunity to work with children and by the flexible work 
schedules two shifts of three hours each in the morning and 
afternoon he says 
ryder transports some 400000 students each school day in more 
than 7000 buses in 15 states

second quarter hiring will be somewhat softer than the same 
period last year according to a survey by manpower inc the 
international temporary services firm 
among businesses surveyed 26 percent plan to add staff during 
the aprilmayjune period a drop from last years 30 percent 
decreases in staff are projected in 8 percent of the companies up 
from last years 6 percent percentages are based on responses from 
a quarterly survey from among the 15000 public and private 
employers surveyed by manpower 
the weakness shows up in the slow pickup in hiring plans from 
the first to second quarter of this year says mitchell s 
fromstein the firms president we usually see a drop in hiring 
in january after the holiday period which is followed by a sharp 
increase in the second quarter the pickup is there this year but 
the usual eightpoint increase is down to six points 
these lower hiring projections are still above normal 
recession levels 
sharp declines from a year ago in the northeast is largely 
responsible for the downward trend according to the survey stable 
hiring is forecast for the south and midwest and hiring 
projections for the west are marginally higher than they were for 
last year 
the downtrend is most noticeable in manufacturing both durable 
and nondurable goods manufacturers project sharp declines in 
hiring construction and service sectors continue to show 
aboveaverage growth while wholesale and retail trades are near 
the allindustry average

because of a shrinking labor pool workers in the 
year 2000 will be in a better position to realize workplace demands 
such as better environments continuing education extensive 
benefits packages and shorter work schedules 
thats the picture that emerges from a survey of 1300 business 
people in eight countries conducted by priority management system 
inc a management training firm 
by the end of this decade taking time off will become more 
important than making more money says dan stamp the firms 
president 
the survey report called the 21st century workplace shows 
that employees want to change or escape from pressures of todays 
workplace 95 percent of respondents work more than 40 hours a 
week 49 percent took two weeks or less in vacation time during the 
past year 36 percent lack adequate skills to operate a computer or 
other hightech equipment and 66 percent feel their jobs are more 
stressful than they were a decade ago 
when asked what would make them happier most respondents said 
they wanted more time with family good health job challenges and 
opportunity and that these benefits ranked ahead of making more 
money 
businesses will have to be sensitive to the altering 
complexion of employee needs if they are going to attract and 
retain qualified personnel concludes stamp

a new quirk in corporate hiring is the interim 
executive according to john a thompson chairman of the interim 
management corp 
thompson says many corporations are using executive temps to 
solve their shortterm problems 
they serve as chief executive officer chief financial 
officer comptroller chief loan officer marketing manager and any 
other executive category in which there is an immediate need he 
says 
an interim management strategy allows a company to meet 
challenges without padding its permanent team or draining its 
resources its not a stopgap measure its a sound lowrisk 
strategy that any organization can use to ensure versatility and 
depth 
most interim managers he says are not outofwork executives 
but people who have achieved a degree of financial independence 
and prefer shortterm assignments rather than permanent corporate 
positions 
thompsons company which specializes in supplying highlevel 
executives on a temporary basis to industry and the nonprofit 
sector offers this list of questions for potential interim 
executives 
have you held a highlevel management position for at least 10 
years 
do you prefer to use your expertise in a wide variety of 
situations 
are you a quick learner 
are you a selfstarter who needs a minimum of supervision 
do you enjoy working in situations where the objectives are 
relatively shortterm and well defined 
are you comfortable with not knowing where you will be working 
in six months

college students may discover that the best way to find a job 
after graduation is to find a job during college through 
internships 
an internship is often the answer to more questions than most 
students even realize they have says barbara yanowski faculty 
member and advisor to the internship program at columbia college in 
chicago 
she says virtually every department in the liberal arts school 
at columbia has a formal internship program with more than 160 
chicago area employers participating 
of course the most important question is will i get a job 
after college but there are other questions as well she says 
what do i want to do where do i want to work am i taking the 
right classes an internship program helps students gain a 
perspective on who they are and what they want in school and out 
working with professionals in the field helps students focus on 
their career goals and objectives says yanowski its hard to 
know what you want to do if youve never done it before students 
not only learn from coworkers about their given field of interest 
they also benefit from the advice guidance and experience of 
people whove been in their position before and theres the added 
plus of great networking opportunities for the future 
ed andrzejewski a television major at columbia served an 
internship in the audiovisual department at the harris bank in 
chicago 
my internship here is giving me the chance to apply what ive 
learned in school to a profession im using advanced equipment 
actually making training videos getting involved in everything 
from editing to pre and postproduction he says 
at the bank charles perkins an assistant vice president who 
frequently hires interns says i look for an intern who can work 
well under pressure someone who is bright aggressive and a 
selfinitiator who can solve problems and adapt to his environment 
here we need someone who can communicate effectively and adapt to 
almost any situation 
david monk an inhouse producer and employer of interns at 
marshall field amp co in chicago says internships provide a 
great opportunity for students to see if theyd enjoy a particular 
kind of work environment an internship is the best way to find 
out what makes you happiest 
from a business point of view he says not only does the 
intern provide an extra pair of hands but an enthusiasm and 
excitement that motivates everyone 
yanowski says many colleges have formal internship programs like 
columbias and many others have job boards where opportunities are 
listed she also recommends the alumni office which often lists 
alumni and their present occupation 
the library is also a good resource she says for annual 
reports the dun amp bradstreet directory chamber of commerce 
publications and thomas register of american manufacturers all 
ways to learn about different industries and specific companies

taking time out to raise children did not 
affect the earnings of barnard colleges class of 1945 according 
to a survey conducted by edith u fierst a member of the class a 
washington attorney and mother of three 
the years out of the labor force do not appear to have had a 
major impact on final earnings she says those within a given 
occupation tended to end up in the same bracket whether or not they 
had taken time out for children 
fiersts survey covered 75 class members or a third of her 
class at barnard a liberal arts college in new york city 
affiliated with columbia university of the group 80 percent said 
they had held paying jobs and almost all of the group who had 
children took time out to care for them before returning to work 
one of the things fierst discovered in her survey was that 
contrary to conventional wisdom the women didnt find fulltime 
motherhood boring or depressing instead they said it was happy 
fulfilling and joyous most of the respondents said they believe 
staying home with the children was the right thing to do

clenching muscles dizziness back pain 
fatigue eating disorders and substance abuse all can be symptoms 
of stress on the job 
but there are ways to destress says wendy reid crisp 
executive director of the national association for female 
executives 
because stress can cause muscles to tighten crisp suggests a 
daily exercise routine such as taking a walk or doing some 
stretching light exercise can help loosen these muscles making 
you feel more relaxed she advises 
drawing from her own experience and that of others she 
recommends looking at your work area to reduce or eliminate 
stressors 
sometimes there are factors in the office that can contribute 
to a stressful environment she notes 
working under bright fluorescent lights can cause dizziness or 
disrupt your concentration an uncomfortable room temperature can 
make you feel fatigued and sluggish try using a desk lamp instead 
of fluorescent overhead lights 
as for regulating the temperature a portable fan or radiator 
is a comfortable solution 
taking a break outside for fresh air is another crisp suggestion 
at the end of a specific task whether its an exhausting 
meeting or writing a lengthy report take a mental break she 
says it can be as simple as a walk around the block or making a 
quick phone call to a friend it will help clear your head and 
mentally prepare you for what lies ahead 
take one day at a time she adds and when its time to go home 
try to accept the fact that you cant solve all of your work 
problems in one day and that theres no way to fix all jobrelated 
problems after the work day is done

the first day at a new job is much like 
the first day of school an exciting time but an anxious one 
whats the best way to approach it get right down to business 
or watch your new boss and colleagues for a while to pick up cues 
to the office culture 
theres nothing wrong with showing eagerness to assume new 
responsibilities says james case director of the career 
services and placement center at the university of rochester but 
beginning a new job is a bit like moving to a foreign country 
theres a hidden culture that youve got to know 
if youre a good observer if you ask the right questions and 
if youre willing to adopt a style that meshes with those unwritten 
rules that others seem to obey then youll probably be accepted 
case says that among the things to pay attention to are the 
dress code the style in which others interact to get work done 
teamwork or solo efforts and the level of involvement the boss 
prefers when an employee carries out an assignment 
when people complain theyve been victimized by office 
politics says case they may have been discounted because 
they clashed with the style or values of the workplace whether by 
choice or accident 
he advises too that you have a good idea of what is expected 
of people in the job position before you even apply for it 
theres a world of difference between loving to play volleyball 
and being a successful volleyball coach he cites as an example 
if you were thinking about becoming a coach youd be smart to 
talk to some coaches about what they do about what they like about 
their jobs and what they dont like then you could decide whether 
you think youd really enjoy the work 
five key questions to ask the job holder he says 
1 how do you spend your time during a typical work week 
2 what skills or talents are most essential to being effective 
in your job 
3 what are the toughest problems you face 
4 what is most rewarding about the work itself apart from 
salary or fringe benefits 
5 if you were ever to leave your job what would drive you 
away

first impression so making a good one can be a vital key in your 
quest for corporate success how you look and how you communicate 
during an interview can affect its outcome 
among contenders with equal qualifications the candidate who 
with the best communications skills is the one most likely to get 
the job offer says barbara mcentee a new york city communications 
consultant whose clients include some of the countrys top 
companies in fact the ability to communicate well is ranked as 
the number one key to success by leaders in business politics and 
the professions she says

value a traditional approach to work and apparel 
some of his recommendations for the job applicant 
suit navy blue or dark gray pinstripes single breasted 
shirt white with spread or buttondown collar some 
companies have a whiteshirtonly policy 
tie ancient madder foulard or patterned silk never wear a 
striped tie with a pinstripe suit 
handkerchief for breast pocket optional it should complement 
but not match the tie 
socks navy blue or black overthecalf 
shoes calfskin laceups well polished 
press says clothes should be thought of as a career investment 
if a suit is selected with care he notes it will last five 
or more years without going out of style 
both men and women should strive for the neat tailored look he 
adds 
posture also is important in the job interview according to 
linda fields an expert on body language and public speaking 
slouching sends a message youre insecure and nervous and 
perhaps not capable of handling the job says ms fields a 
principal of new yorkbased fields amp mckamy international speaker 
services sitting on the edge of the chair will help you avoid the 
slouch she says 
both ms fields and mcentee say the candidate should maintain 
eye contact and appear confident

chinas listless economy wont begin to recover 
until the second half of the year jeopardizing the nations 
industrial growth target a government economist said monday 
zhang zhongji of the state statistical bureau told a news 
conference that the economy had failed to respond to several 
measures taken during the first quarter of the year 
he said an infusion of 42 billion in loans for slumping 
industries double the amount for the same period of 1989 had 
contributed mainly to further overstocking of unsold products 
zhang provided figures most already released showing zero 
growth in industrial output value over the first quarter with a 
31 percent downturn in retail sales and sharp declines in the 
production of durable consumer goods 
he said austerity measures initiated in late 1988 to slow down 
inflation and runaway economic growth had shown some positive 
results retail prices were up only 39 percent from the previous 
year the lowest increase since 1988 energy production was up a 
solid 67 percent the trade balance was favorable and goods on the 
marketplace were plentiful 
but there has been no fundamental change in the slump of the 
market stagnation in industrial production and poor economic 
efficiency he said 
zhang predicted little economic growth in the second quarter he 
said the economy will only begin to recover in the second half of 
the year 
reaching the government target of industrial growth of 5 percent 
to 6 percent will be a very difficult and arduous task he said 
zhang said the economic slump caused concern for many people 
but declined to characterize the situation as a recession he said 
it was not surprising to see some stagnation and even decline 
as the government tries to control inflation and adjust the 
industrial structure

the supreme court today refused to block an 
alaska state court trial of a lawsuit that accuses oil companies of 
underpaying the state for oil leases 
the justices without comment rejected arguments the oil 
companies cannot get a fair trial in alaska because all residents 
including judges and prospective jurors would share in any 
additional money the firms could be ordered to pay 
alaska officials sued in 1983 seeking damages from 19 oil 
producers who received state leases to mine the states north slope 
the state said the companies underestimated the value of oil and 
gas taken from prudhoe bay and kuparuk river fields 
three companies that are trying to kill the suit said 26 
billion could be at stake and that could translate into 70 a year 
indefinitely for each state resident qualified to share in the 
proceeds the three companies are standard alaska production co 
exxon corp and chevron usa 
a share of all oil royalties go into a special state fund 
created so that alaska residents can share in the states mineral 
wealth 
about half the yearly income produced by the fund is distributed 
to qualified residents in the form of dividends 
the oil companies said the existence of the fund means it is 
impossible to get an impartial judge and jury in alaska to consider 
the states suit for additional payments 
every judge and juror in alaska has an inherent bias 
lawyers for the oil companies said since a successful suit by the 
state could put more money in their pockets 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year the 
companies bid to use the federal courts to block the state court 
proceedings is premature 
the appeals court said even assuming that each state resident 
stands to gain 70 a year from the suit we do not have 
sufficient facts before us to determine whether such a sum is a 
substantial financial interest compelling disqualification of 
judges and jurors 
it is also possible that some judges and prospective jurors 
would be willing to forgo any extra benefits from the suit the 
appeals court said 
the case is bp exploration vs baily 891375

the number of working us oil and natural gas 
rigs fell by two this week to total 932 baker hughes reported 
monday 
the rig count has declined by three and nine respectively the 
past two weeks a year ago the count was 767 baker hughes said 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oilproducing states texas and oklahoma posted the 
largest gain with six each while colorado gained one 
california recorded the largest decline for the week with five 
followed by north dakota four louisiana ohio and pennsylvania 
three each wyoming two and michigan one 
kansas and new mexico remained unchanged from last week

eurotunnel said monday it would raise up to 41 
billion more from its banks and shareholders to finish its rail 
tunnel under the english channel 
the anglofrench consortium said the cost of the 31mile tunnel 
has risen to up to 124 billion due to soaring construction and 
borrowing costs only half the boring has been completed the 
company said 
last year it said the project would cost 114 billion and 
three years the price tag was at 793 billion 
the company said it would sell up to 815 million worth of new 
shares to its existing shareholders after it completed talks with 
its bankers about expanding credit facilities 
eurotunnel said it expected to increase funds available to the 
project up to 138 billion from 11 billion 
we are going to raise more than we need so we dont have to go 
through this asking for extra finance exercise again said 
eurotunnel deputy chairman alastair morton 
morton said that with the actual tunneling work halffinished 
he was confident the extra funds could be raised 
morton said tunneling progress has been satisfactory we have 
gone from having a third of the actual tunneling work completed to 
having half of it done in just 16 weeks he said 
eurotunnels 208 banks already have put up 82 billion in 
credit eurotunnel said that it would seek release of additional 
funds from that credit line in june to cover operating expenses 
while it negotiated terms on additional credit 
the consortium blamed the increased costs primarily on added 
expenses forecast by its main contractor transmanche link which 
cited inflation and the need to add workers to assure that the 
project is completed by its june 1993 target 
eurotunnel also cited rising interest costs at a time of 
increased borrowing 
some of the additional costs might be slightly offset by savings 
from a costcontrol agreement reached in january between eurotunnel 
and transmanche link eurotunnel said 
the strained relations between the two over disputed costs 
apparently have improved 
morton said the relationship between the two companies was 
always good at sitelevel its now good on the daytoday project 
level 
but eurotunnel noted that it still was in dispute over some 
costs with transmanche

the us dollar rose against most major foreign 
currencies monday in european trading gold prices were mixed 
dealers said the dollars advance was largely a reflection of 
the selling of european currencies amid renewed jitters over german 
unification 
market activity was modest and it appeared participants were 
waiting for us durable goods data on tuesday and fridays us 
gross national product figures before becoming convinced of the 
dollars strength traders said 
the dollar which is considered a safe refuge in times of

lithuania caused by the soviet economic embargo on the separatist 
republic dealers said 
in tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 15755 japanese yen from

history is repeating itself in cyprus 
the east mediterranean island which grew fabulously rich in the 
middle ages as the main link between europe and the orient is 
becoming an international offshore banking and business center 
the merchants of cyprus in the 15th century grew so wealthy that 
they used to produce fruit bowls laden with diamonds and other gems 
for important visitors who could choose one as a gift 
cypriot hospitality is not so lavish now but official 
statistics list more than 6000 offshore companies including 19 
foreign banks and numerous financial services based on the 
island which has emerged as the principal transit point to what 
used to be the thriving city of beirut lebanon 
many companies are there in name only as cyrprus provides a 
convenient mailing address and a way to keep a presence in a part 
of the world continuallly racked by war and terrorism 
but nearly 700 maintain offices employing more than 3000 
people the central bank said they pumped 95 million into the 
economy of the greek sector of the wardivided island last year 
cyprus was divided in 1974 when the turkish army invaded and 
seized the northern onethird of the island it is now a breakway 
turkish cypriot republic 
the island has become the regional center for major news 
organizations including the wests three major wire services it 
also has the worlds fastest growing shipping registry 
nearly 2000 ships call cyprus home making it numerically the 
third largest fleet in the world in terms of tonnage it ranks 
seventh with a gross total of nearly 19 million tons 
the island has a long way to go to catch up with bahrain 
financial center of the oilrich persian gulf with 60 offshore 
banks 
but recently banks from the soviet union yugoslavia and jordan 
have set up in cyprus and a group of 30 japanese bankers visited 
the island 
cyprus got its start as a regional business hub when the civil 
war in lebanon 100 miles to the southeast broke out in april 1975 
many beirutbased companies relocated to cyprus a bonanza for 
the island that the year before had been ravaged by the turkish 
invasion 
the majority greek cypriots who lost rich farmlands tourist 
facilities and a major port in the invasion had little choice but 
to rebuild their economy with new tourist facilities and offshore 
business 
tourism lifeblood of the economy has now reached 13 million 
visitors a year bringing in an estimated 900 million annually for 
the 550000 greek cypriots 
it still is expanding hani yamani son of the former saudi oil 
minister ahmet zaki yamani recently announced a 300 million 
project for the most luxurious hotel in the world a greek 
history theme park and other facilities on 2500 acres on cyprus 
west coast 
but the focus is to build cyprus up as a business center it got 
a major boost when george vassiliou a selfmade millionaire 
business consultant was elected president in february 1988 
addressing a business seminar last month vassiliou said that in 
a small country with scant natural resources the provision of 
services is probably the only sector of activity that we can 
develop steadily to provide employment and a steady increase in the 
standard of living of our people 
late last year the central bank launched a campaign to attract 
more investment and offshore business 
central bank gov afxentis afxentiou stressed the islands 
geographical position at the crossroads of europe asia and africa 
and its satellite communications network as advantages for

soaring costs are forcing eurotunnel to seek an 
extra 41 billion from banks and investors to finish the 31mile 
rail tunnel under the english channel the anglofrench consortium 
said monday 
but eurotunnel said it has dug half the tunnel and maintained 
that the historic link between england and france would open as 
scheduled in june 1993 
when operating eurotunnel trains will travel from london to 
paris in three hours 
the consortium said higher construction and borrowing costs had 
pushed the projects total price tag to as high as 124 billion 
up from 114 billion in october and 79 billion three years ago 
when the project was launched 
the company said it would sell up to 815 million worth of new 
shares to existing stockholders after it completed its talks with 
its bankers about expanding credit facilities 
shareholders already have put up 163 billion and eurotunnels 
208 banks have provided 82 billion in credit the consortium said 
it expected to increase its total available funds to as much as 
139 billion 
we dont intend to go through this process again eurotunnel 
deputy chairman alastair morton told a news conference 
the deputy chairman expressed confidence in eurotunnels ability 
to raise the extra money 
eurotunnels shares were up the equivalent of 20 cents at 954 
late monday on londons stock exchange 
the expanded credit should be in place by the end of the summer 
and the share sale should take place by the end of the year said 
graham corbett managing director of finance 
the digging has improved recently because of increased 
reliability of boring machines and better ground conditions said 
alistair fleming managing director of construction 
english and french workers digging toward each other have 
bored a total of 50 miles of tunnel he said 
eurotunnel comprises three tubes one train tunnel for each 
direction and a service tunnel which is expected to be completed 
this autumn 
we will break through at the end of november fleming said 
the consortium blamed the increased costs primarily on added 
expenses forecast by its main contractor transmanche link which 
cited inflation and the need to add workers to assure that the 
project is completed as scheduled 
eurotunnel also cited rising interest costs as it increased 
borrowing british interest rates are around 15 percent 
some of the additional costs might be slightly offset by savings 
from a costcontrol agreement reached in january between eurotunnel 
and transmanche link eurotunnel said 
relations between the two have been strained over cost 
differences eurotunnel said it still was in dispute with 
transmanche over 11 billion in costs

the supreme court on monday agreed to review a 
ruling that if upheld could cost a bank holding company over 13 
million in damages 
the court said it will decide whether first american bankshares 
inc fabi violated federal securities law prior to a 1987 merger 
of its subsidiary virginia bankshares inc and the first american 
bank of virginia 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled last dec 15 that 
fabi violated securities law by sending first american bank of 
virginia minority shareholders misleading proxy statements 
before the merger virginia bankshares owned 85 percent of the 
stock in the first american bank of virginia a merger was proposed 
so fabi through its subsidiary would buy up the remaining 15 
percent and own all the banks stock 
fabi paid 42 per share for the minority shareholders stock 
but the merger was challenged in federal court by doris i 
sandberg who owned 2242 shares of first american bank of virginia 
a federal jury ruled for her and awarded her 43956 or 18 
per share in damages 
the presiding judge had refused to certify the suit as a class 
action filed in behalf of all the banks minority shareholders 
the 4th circuit court upheld the jurys verdict but ruled that 
the trial judge should have certified the lawsuit as a class action 
the result of this ruling is that the 43956 judgment that 
the jury awarded to sandberg might now be transformed on remand 
into a judgment in excess of 13 million lawyers for fabi told 
the justices 
in the appeal acted on monday the fabi lawyers argued among 
other things that the proxy statements found to have been 
misleading could not possibly have affected the outcome of the 
proxy vote the appeal said that fabi had far more than the 
twothirds of the share votes needed to bring about the merger 
without the consent of any minority shareholders 
the appeal also contended that no minority shareholder proved to 
have actually relied on the statements 
the appeals court ruled that reliance does not have to be proved 
in lawsuits invoking the securities law banning false or misleading 
proxy statements 
the case is virginia bankshares inc vs sandberg 891448

the right to strike a 
constitutional guarantee unions consider sacred would be severely 
restricted by legislation president carlos menem sent to congress 
on monday 
the peronist party president elected last may with the support 
of organized labor said the measure is needed to curtail walkouts 
that have disrupted schools commuter trains federal courts 
municipal hospitals phones and other public services 
if we obtain consensus for it thats great if we dont we 
will push it through anyway a determined menem said last week 
the measure would require unions that provide essential 
services to give at least 10 days notice of a strike and submit 
to mediation by the labor ministry that could last 15 more days 
management would be authorized to hire enough workers for a 
minimum level of service if strikers did not comply with the 
notice or tried to block all service they could be fired and 
unions could lose their legal status 
the legislation cites public health transport energy schools 
and telecommunications as essential services and leaves open 
the possibility that strikes by private unions also might be 
regulated 
victor de gennaro director of the 145000member association of 
state employees said the bill has as its objective the 
intimidation of workers 
juan manuel casella the civic radical unions candidate for 
vice president in the may 1989 national elections said the 
legislation is aimed more to punish workers than to regulate 
strikes 
the measure which menem at first said he would impose by 
decree upset even peronist legislators reluctant to alienate a 
group whose support has been steadfast during three decades of 
repression 
peronist sen orando britos said flatly he would vote against 
it a bloc of eight dissident peronist deputies in the lower house 
indicated they would too 
technically the ruling party has an absolute majority in the 
senate and a working majority in the chamber of deputies 
menem 59 is a lifelong member of the party and a threetime 
provincial governor he was arrested and held in detention with 
many peronist politicians and labor leaders following the march 
1976 military coup that toppled president isabel peron 
the measure is not his first that unions say is antilabor 
since menem took office last july amid hyperinflation and 
recession public service rates have risen faster than salaries 
contributing to the contraction of real wages 
despite campaign promises of massive wage hikes and a 
productive revolution menem has imposed an austerity budget 
that has exacerbated unemployment 
as many as 48 million argentines of a workforce of 125 
million are unemployed or underemployed according to the labor 
ministry 
menem appointed executives from argentinas largest 
multinational company as his first two economy ministers he 
ignored union pleas by lifting controls on wages prices and 
foreign exchange and by committing the government to sell 
moneylosing public companies 
anticipating conflict menem tried to unseat saul ubaldini as 
leader of the 3millionmember general labor confederation that 
failed but the confederation split into rival camps 
in recent weeks public school teachers from grade school 
through university have boycotted classes employees of the 
stateowned airline and telephone company have staged wildcat 
strikes doctors at municipal hospitals and court clerks have 
walked off the job 
unions are demanding pay increases which the government says it 
cannot afford also they are seeking a greater voice in the sale 
of state companies two of which the airline and telephone 
company are to be sold this year 
after months of currency devaluation and inflation that soared 
by 95 percent last month there are signs the government is 
bringing the economy under control 
inflation in april is projected at 12 percent to 15 percent the 
austral has held steady at 5000 for every us dollar or less 
since early march prices in supermarkets and department stores 
have begun to come down 
after an estimated 60000 union members staged an 
antigovernment demonstration on the steps of congress that many 
and more rallied at government house to shout their support for 
menem

sir james goldsmiths hoylake investments ltd 
said today it would not renew its 22 billion bid for the british 
conglomerate bat industries plc 
the hostile bid of 878 pence or 1431 a share would have been 
the worlds secondlargest takeover after kohlberg kravis roberts 
amp cos 25 billion purchase of rjr nabisco inc completed early 
last year 
the hoylake investors group dropped the bid because it simply 
felt that the combination of the time the bid would take to get 
through us regulatory hurdles and the costs thereof tipped the 
riskreward ratio the wrong way said a spokesman for one of 
hoylakes merchant banks who spoke anonymously 
hoylake said in a statement the directors of hoylake wish bat 
and its unbundled offspring great success within their new 
structures 
hoylakes withdrawal comes after californias state insurance 
regulators decided april 9 to bar a change of control of bats 
farmers insurance group inc of los angeles the offer needed 
approval from the commissioners of the nine states where farmers 
operates 
the withdrawal is a major defeat for goldsmith an anglofrench 
financier who has built a worldwide reputation by taking over and 
breaking up companies 
the news of the withdrawal came after londons stock exchange 
closed bat shares ended at 724 pence or 1180 a share down 4 
pence 
hoylake launched the offer last july but suspended it in 
september while it sought the clearance from the us state 
insurance commissioners 
bat has been restructuring itself to fend off the bid the 
hoylake withdrawal probably will not affect the restructuring 
which is designed to boost bats share price 
i am pleased that hoylke and axamidi have finally abandoned 
their bid bat chairman patrick sheehy said in a statement issued 
in the united states we can now devote our full attention to 
running the continuing group based on our financial services and 
tobacco businesses 
the hoylake investors group also included british merchant 
banker jacob rothschild and australian businessman kerry packer 
goldsmith and other shareholders have complained that bats 
stock price does not reflect the stocks real value because it is 
dragged down by the slower growth of its tobacco businesses 
bat is selling and spinning off its retailing and paper 
businesses to concentrate on tobacco and financial services 
last week bat announced the sale of its us retailer marshall 
fields to dayton hudson corp its saks fifth avenue unit also is 
on the auction block 
bat also is in the process of buying back up to 10 percent of 
its own stock

a japanese company has made a friendly offer of 
738 million pounds or 120 million for aquascutum group plc the 
classic british clothing retailer the companies said monday 
renown inc a japanese clothing manufacturer that specializes 
in middlerange ladies wear offered 200 pence or 326 for each 
of aquascutums 273 million special a shares the companies said 
in addition renown offered 550 pence or 897 for each of the

executive

a shares and 656 percent of the ordinary shares from the abrahams 
family and other shareholders

ordinary shares who have been seeking to end the special voting 
rights of aquascutums a shares those efforts had raised the 
prospect of a hostile offer for the company 
founded in 1851 aquascutum operates a dozen of its own stores 
with flagships in london and new york and wholesale outlets in 45 
countries it has 1600 employees 
abrahams said the offer was an exciting opportunity to 
expand and that it would allow aquascutum to get on with our 
business 
the japanese firm is seeking to upgrade its clothing line 
abrahams said 
we are a growing business in the far east a prestigious brand 
of very high quality goods abrahams said 
aquascutum will remain based in london he said 
the company also announced that its net profit for the year 
ended jan 31 fell 3 percent to 193 million pounds or 31 
million from 199 million pounds a year earlier earnings per

stock prices fell for the fourth straight 
session today still in the grip of interestrate and inflation 
worries 
analysts said fears of rising interest rates kept a dominant 
hold on the mood among investors 
a sharp rise in rates last week raised yields on longterm 
government bonds close to 9 percent their highest levels since 
last may 
as a new week began predictions abounded of further increases 
in rates partly on the basis of signs that business activity had 
picked up recently 
higher interest rates are seen as an increasingly significant 
obstacle to hopes that corporate earnings might improve as the year 
progresses

frustrated by us regulatory delays sir james 
goldsmiths hoylake investments ltd on monday ended its 
acrimonious ninemonth takeover battle for the british 
conglomerate bat industries plc 
the decision marks a major defeat for goldsmith the noted 
raider whose groups 22 billion allsecurities offer for bat would 
have been the worlds secondlargest takeover after the 25 billion 
buyout of rjr nabisco inc last year 
bat whose us companies include brown amp williamson tobacco and 
the saks fifth avenue department stores has been restructuring by 
selling its retailing and paper businesses to concentrate on 
tobacco and financial services 
goldsmith and other shareholders have complained that the slower 
growth of the tobacco businesses has dragged down bats stock 
price and that several of its business lines needed to be 
jettisoned 
but two weeks ago california insurance regulators decided to 
block the proposed sale of bats farmers insurance group inc of 
los angeles a key element of the planned takeover 
hoylake had planned to sell farmers for 45 billion to the 
french insurance group axamidi assurances the offer needed 
approval from the commissioners of a total of nine states where 
farmers operates 
a london source close to hoylake said the group which also 
includes british merchant banker jacob rothschild and australian 
businessman kerry packer dropped its offer because of us 
regulatory delays 
we have always felt we could achieve a favorable position but 
it could take quite a while said the source who didnt want to 
be identified we didnt feel it was in the best interests of the 
shareholders given the uncertainties 
after hoylake announced monday that it was withdrawing axamidi 
announced in paris that it had dropped its bid 
axas statement said that we understand hoylakes decision 
but we are sorry that it obliges us to give up the acquisition of 
farmers 
jeffrey beyer a farmers group spokesman in los angeles said 
state regulators objections to axamidis debtfinanced offer for 
farmers and the way hoylake proposed to transfer ownership had been 
wideranging and nearly impossible to remedy 
certainly axa was facing what we thought were insurmountable 
difficulties beyer said 
hoylakes offer of 878 pence the equivalent of 1431 worth 
of securities for each bat share had been suspended since last 
september while it sought regulatory approval 
bats shares finished down 4 pence at 724 pence or about 
1180 on londons stock exchange the statements came after the 
exchange close and bat declined about 40 pence in after hours 
trading 
bat chairman patrick sheehy issued a statement that he was 
pleased about hoylakes decision which he called overdue he said 
the company would press ahead with its massive defensive 
restructuring 
last week bat announced the sale of its us retailer marshall 
fields to dayton hudson corp for 104 billion saks fifth avenue 
also is on the auction block 
shareholders gave overwhelming support to our reshaping 
proposals in a vote last october sheehy stated todays 
overdue decision by hoylake does not alter our resolve to see that 
program through to its completion and to continue to maximize value 
for our shareholders 
for goldsmith who built a worldwide reputation for taking over 
and breaking up companies the withdrawal represents a major defeat 
i think hes gone from bat for good said jack jones an 
analyst with the london investment firm ubs philips and drew 
jones said he was somewhat surprised by the decision given 
recent positive comments by hoylake and axamidi 
but william de winton of nomura research institute in london 
said he was surprised how long the expensive bid dragged on 
from the start everyone knew the regulatory hurdle would be 
the problem de winton said they took it further than some 
people expected them to 
anyone going for bat will face what in effect seems to amount 
to a poison pill in the form of the us state regulatory system 
he said 
hoylake controls about 19 million bat shares or about 2 percent 
of the company said a hoylake spokesman no decision had been made 
on what to do with the stake said the spokesman who was not 
identified in accordance with british practice

the dollar strengthened against most major 
currencies monday benefiting from the west german marks weakness 
speculation that us interest rates will move higher as the 
economy continues to expand also encouraged dollar buying dealers 
said 
gold prices were mixed rising in new york after falling in some 
overseas markets on the new york commodity exchange gold bullion 
for april delivery settled at 37890 a troy ounce 230 higher 
than fridays close later republic national bank of new york 
quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at 37865 as of 4 pm edt up 
240 from fridays late bid 
ronald holzer chief currency dealer at harris trust in chicago 
said the mark was sold heavily amid worries about the consequences 
of planned german unification 
the governments of east and west germany have said they will 
merge their economies completely on july 1 as a prelude to full 
unification expected next year but the governments have not 
reached a final agreement on linking their currencies 
the dollar which is considered a safe investment refuge in 
times of economic or political uncertainty also benefited from 
news of growing oil shortages in lithuania caused by the soviet 
economic embargo on the republic 
also contributing to the dollars strength were expectations of 
domestic economic growth accompanied by rising credit costs higher 
us interest rates would enhance returns on dollardenominated 
investments and tend to boost demand for dollars 
i would say the dollar is benefiting in general from higher 
us rates and the perception that the us economy is still moving 
along at a moderate to good pace holzer said 
it was anticipated that a report due tuesday on orders for 
durable goods and a report friday on the gross national product 
would confirm that the economic expansion has staged a modest 
revival 
in tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 15755 japanese yen from 
15760 yen at fridays close later in london it was unchanged 
in new york the dollar settled at 15755 yen up from 15750 yen 
on friday 
the british pound rose to 16365 in london from 16357 late

gold prices moved mostly lower in overseas trading before rising 
in domestic dealings

from 37450 late friday in zurich the metal fell to a closing

than 24 million barrels of crude a day well over its ceiling of

production raised traders hopes that prices might return to their 
higher levels and energy futures rallied on thursday

optimistic monday according to andrew lebow an analyst with 
edampf man international futures inc

increases in rates partly on the basis of signs that business 
activity had picked up recently

about 850 workers for the santa fe railroad face 
layoffs because of sharp drops in shipments of automobiles and 
grain two of the railroads most important commodities the 
company announced monday 
some of the layoffs will start as early as a week from 
today robert gehrt spokesman for the atchison topeka and santa 
fe railway co said monday we hope to have most of them in 
place by may 15 
the layoffs will affect about 125 workers at the locomotive shop 
at san bernardino calif and an additional 100 from the railroad 
car repair shops in topeka kan the company said in a statement 
about 70 workers will be laid off from the companys centralized 
work equipment plant at albuquerque nm and 15 will be laid off 
at the newton kan rail plant the statement said 
an additional 200 section gang workers one from each gang and 
75 specialty gang employees will be laid off 
about 100 management employees will be laid off but the 
departments affected by those cutbacks have not been determined 
company president michael r haverty said in the statement 
santa fe which employs about 18000 people said the remainder 
of the layoffs are not expected to have a major impact in any one 
community 
automobile shipping dropped 47 percent in early april and grain 
shipping declined 40 percent the two normally account for about 22 
percent of the railroads business 
when you get a big hit like this in those two areas its 
something to be concerned about gehrt said 
piggybacking semitrailers account for more than 20 percent of 
the companys business gehrt said while shipments of food and 
farm products other than grain accounts for about 14 percent and 
chemicals for about 12 percent 
haverty said the layoffs are similar to seasonal employment 
reductions the company has undergone in the past but are more 
severe 
santa fe blamed a 10 million increase in fuel costs during the 
first quarter and mediocre firstquarter performance for the 
layoffs 
the company reported firstquarter operating income of 661 
million compared with 342 million for the same quarter last year 
but we had a big property tax refund in california of over 30 
million this quarter and without that we would have been just 
about even gehrt said and last years figures included a 
special charge of over 50 million the first quarter of 1990 
wasnt a good quarter

an investment group headed by texas financier 
robert m bass said monday it planned to vote in favor of a 
shareholders rights plan at the avon products inc annual meeting 
next month 
the robert m bass group decision was disclosed in a filing with 
the securities and exchange commission in washington 
the bass group which holds a 59 percent stake in the new 
yorkbased cosmetics company said it would vote in favor of 
submitting the companys poison pill defense to a shareholder 
vote bass group said it also supported a proposal seeking 
confidential voting for shareholders 
but the bass group said it would vote against a proposal to set 
up a shareholders advisory committee at the annual meeting in new 
york on may 3 
a spokesman for avon john cox said the company which opposes 
the poison pill and confidential voting proposals had no comment 
on the bass group disclosure 
a poison pill defense makes it prohibitively expensive to take 
over a company keeping the identity of those voting in shareholder 
elections secret from management has been a growing issue among 
shareholders rights groups 
the bass group announcement came three weeks after avons 
largest shareholder chartwell associates said it had boosted its 
stake to 16 percent chartwell had been pressuring avon management 
for representation on the board 
chartwell associates is a limited partnership that includes oil 
heir gordon p gettys family trust a subsidiary of dallasbased 
mary kay corp and the fisher real estate family of new york 
avon rejected takeover proposals twice last year from amway 
corp and minneapolisbased investor irwin jacobs

bond prices slipped monday in light trading 
echoing declines overseas as the market awaited economic reports 
due later this week 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 732 point or about 
219 per 1000 face amount its yield which rises when prices 
fall rose to 896 percent from 894 percent late friday 
the last time the yield on the 30year bond was as high was last 
may 11 when it stood at 907 percent 
the 30year bond has plunged more than 41 per 1000 over the 
past seven trading days in response to signs of increasing 
inflation a stronger economy and worries about upcoming bond 
issues including the treasurys quarterly refunding auction set 
for next month 
higher inflation and an economic upturn could prompt the federal 
reserve to keep interest rates high higher rates decrease the 
value of fixedreturn investments such as bonds 
an increased supply of bonds can temporarily drive down prices 
until the market absorbs the new issues 
there were few forces acting on the bond market monday except 
for a softness in prices in overseas trading before us trading 
began said william v sullivan director of money market research 
for dean witter reynolds inc 
it was lethargic he said so the market was just really 
drifting the markets looking ahead to the upcoming data release 
on tuesday the government is scheduled to release reports on 
durable goods orders for march and the employmentcost index for 
the first quarter while the first report on the gross national 
product for 1990 is set to be announced friday 
the market had little reaction to news that west germany agreed 
to exchange a limited number of east german marks for west german 
marks at a 11 ratio some economists believe such a ratio could 
cause inflation in west germany but sullivan said bond traders 
probably viewed the proposal as preliminary 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell from 132 point to lsqb point intermediate 
maturities lost between 532 point and 732 point and longterm 
issues were off from 316 point to point according to telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 141 to 113305 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 532 point to 90 1532 point the 
average yield to maturity rose to 761 percent from 759 percent 
late thursday 
at an auction monday the treasury sold 82 billion in 
threemonth bills at an average discount rate of 778 percent up 
from 771 percent last week another 82 billion was sold in 
sixmonth bills at an average discount rate of 791 percent up 
from 775 percent last week 
the rates were the highest since threemonth bills sold for 780 
percent april 9 and sixmonth bills averaged 792 percent march 19 
in the secondary market for treasury bills yields on 
threemonth bills rose to 797 percent as the discount rose 3 basis 
points to 772 percent yields on sixmonth bills rose to 828 
percent as the discount gained 6 basis points to 786 percent 
yields on oneyear bills rose to 849 percent as the discount 
gained 6 basis point to 789 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 percent unchanged 
from late friday

american and west european officials agreed on 
monday to strengthen their economic and political ties but 
disagreed on how to resolve a simmering discord over farm subsidies 
secretary of state james a baker iii who led the us 
delegation to the talks with the european economic community said 
the two sides discussed the changes in eastern europe and how these 
would affect the eec and the united states 
the two teams also discussed the soviet sanctions against 
lithuania baker said the eec shared with the united states the 
growing international concerns about the soviet response to the 
secessionist baltic state 
the useec ministerial talks held for the first time in the 
united states since they began in 1981 also focused on the effects 
of german unification on the european economy the subject as well 
as the us views will come up saturday at the eec summit in 
dublin ireland 
both baker and eec president jacques delors stressed the 
importance of coordinating their positions as the pace of european 
unification accelerates toward the target date of 1992 and as the 
eec tries to handle the changes brought about by the collapse of 
communism in eastern europe 
the united states is particularly concerned that as the eec 
moves toward a monetary and trade union among its 12 member 
nations us business will be shut out the eec is determined to 
reassure the americans that the new system will leave plenty of 
room for trade with the united states 
this meeting has taken place at a crossroads in atlantic 
history at a time of new significance to the partnership between 
the community and the united states delors told reporters after 
his daylong talks with baker 
both sides agreed on the need to bring the uruguay round of 
international trade talks to a successful conclusion by the end of 
the year 
but officials on both sides said they were worried that their 
dispute on agriculture could endanger the trade talks among 96 
nations which began in 1986 and are intended to liberalize 
commerce around the world 
the agriculture dispute revolves around the question of farm 
subsidies with the united states demanding the 12 eec nations do 
away with support for farmers and the europeans saying this is an 
unrealistic demand 
its certain the united states wants to go down the road f 
reform more than the eec said agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter that doesnt mean we cant resolve our differences until 
december 
the two delegations agreed to speed up their talks on the 
subject and appointed staff members to deal with various aspects of 
the dispute including the question of market access and export 
subsidies 
but the eecs agriculture commissioner raymond mcsharr 
cautioned that there are many difficulties and they musnt be 
underestimated

american express co chairman james d robinson 
iii told shareholders monday the companys troubled wall street 
subsidiary shearson lehman hutton inc was well positioned to 
return to profitability 
shearson reported a 915 million firstquarter loss the 
largest in securities industry history in large part to pay for a 
restructuring that included 2000 layoffs and business cuts 
initiated by american express 
american express lost 620 million in the first three months of 
1990 because of the troubles at shearson 
its the price we paid to put shearsons major problems behind 
us robinson told about 500 shareholders attending american 
express annual meeting in new york 
shearson needed time and capital but market conditions 
demanded immediate action he said 
american express last month announced a plan to buy all the 
remaining publicly held shares of shearson capping several months 
of turmoil at the wall street firm that analysts say overexpanded 
in the 1980s 
the payment card and travel services giant moved to gain 
management control of shearson by ousting peter cohen as chairman 
and installing an american express executive in his place howard 
l clark jr 
shearson then laid off 2000 workers in march with more 
expected by the end of the year and began plans to eliminate or 
scale back several business lines 
in addition to extending its current 61 percent stake to full 
ownership american express has provided 115 billion to shore up 
shearsons capital base in recent months 
robinson said that six months ago shearson didnt fit as a 
core operating entity and had been reduced to a strategic 
investment 
he attributed shearsons troubles to declining stock trading 
activity since the 1987 market crash rising worldwide interest 
rates a slumping domestic real estate market and the collapse of 
the junk bond market last fall 
the environment for securities companies changed rapidly and 
radically robinson said the result was a crisis for 
shearson 
but he said american express changes at the investment firm had 
left shearson well positioned to make money he did not say 
when he expected shearson to become profitable 
robinson admitted that some of shearsons expansion moves in the 
1980s under cohen were wrong including the 1988 purchase of ef 
hutton inc which added an extensive retail brokerage network and 
expensive overhead while causing animosity among employees 
in retrospect the hutton acquisition or at least the way it 
was structured was a mistake he said 
at the annual meeting shareholders elected three new american 
express board members motorola inc chairman george mc fisher 
new york city opera president beverly sills greenough and dow 
chemical co president frank p popoff

prices of most pork belly futures contracts surged the permitted 
daily limit of 2 cents a pound monday on the chicago mercantile 
exchange after an agriculture department report showed smaller 
supplies than traders had anticipated 
on other commodity markets hog futures rallied while cattle 
futures were mixed orange juice futures fell sharply oil futures 
advanced cotton was up precious metals were mixed and grain and 
soybean futures were mixed 
frozen pork belly futures settled 11 cents to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may up 2 cents at 6432 cents a 
pound 
hog futures ended 20 cent to 95 cent higher with june at 6202 
cents a pound live cattle were 27 cent lower to 20 cent higher 
with june at 7390 cents a pound feeder cattle were 28 cent lower 
to 25 cent higher with april at 8390 cents a pound 
the runup in the belly market had been expected since late 
friday afternoon when the usda released a monthly report showing 
975 million pounds of the raw bacon meat in the nations 
commercial freezers at the end of march 
the figure was nearly 3 million pounds below the average market 
estimate and compared with 86 million pounds at the end of february 
and a record 129 million pounds a year ago 
the usda also released a cattle supply report friday the 
quarterly estimage of cattle on feedlots in the 13 largest producer 
states which showed a largerthanexpected number of cattle 
placed on feedlots during the first quarter 
but analysts said the futures markets deep discount to cash 
prices last week had already reflected expectations for larger 
supplies by june so the futures market had little reaction monday 
to the report 
orange juice futures plunged on the new york cotton exchange 
largely reflecting speculative selling ahead of may 1 the first 
day for traders to declare intentions to deliver orange juice 
against the may contract 
speculators holding obligations to take delivery of a commodity 
typically liquidate those positions as first notice day approaches 
so as to avoid taking physical delivery 
celeste georkakis an analyst with cargill investor servicers 
inc said further selling was prompted by a florida department of 
citrus report estimating a 10 percent decline in us demand for 
orange juice mainly reflecting a drop in consumption of frozen 
concentrate 
orange juice futures settled 335 cents to 585 cents lower with 
may at 18965 a pound 
cotton futures advanced strongly on the cotton exchange 
reflecting positionevening ahead of tuesday first notice day for 
the may contract 
cotton specialist ernest simon of prudentialbache securities 
inc said world demand for highquality us cotton has 
strengthened due to a poor australian crop 
cotton settled 20 cent to 130 cents higher with may at 7531 
cents a pound 
oil futures rose on the new york mercantile exchange amid 
jitters about the may 2 opec meeting and what measures the oil 
cartel may take to support oil prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 25 cents 
higher with june at 1907 a barrel heating oil was 15 cent to 
67 cent higher with may at 5312 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 35 cent to 161 cents higher with may at 6354 cents a gallon 
gold futures benefitted from weakness in the stock and bond 
markets as investors shifted assets to the perceived safety of 
gold 
gold settled 230 to 290 higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange with april at 37890 a troy ounce silver was 04 cent to 
08 cent lower with may at 510 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures prices ended mixed on the chicago 
board of trade after a rally in the soybean complex faded late in 
the session 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents lower with may at 
370 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to cent higher with may at 
278 a bushel oats were cent to 2 cents higher with may at

computer giant digital equipment corp has 
been authorized by its board to buy back up to 5 million shares of 
its own common stock on the open market a company spokesman said 
monday 
the purchase would represent about 41 percent of the companys 
outstanding common stock which amounts to more than 122 million 
shares 
in trading on the new york stock exchange on monday digital 
stock rose 25 cents a share to close at 8325 at that price a 
buyback of 5 million shares would cost 41625 million 
we believe the current market value of digital stock does not 
reflect the underlying strengths of the company its customers 
products and the markets it serves as well as its strong financial 
position said james m osterhoff vice president of finance 
the shares purchased would be a way to return some of that 
value to the stockholders said bradley allen spokesman for 
digital 
some of the shares will be used to supply the employee 
purchase stock fund allen said 
he said the company had previously repurchased 18 million shares

political connections to help it beat out archrival american 
airlines for a chicagotokyo link 
united bragged monday that it had successfully solicited letters 
from five state governors two state congressional delegations and 
the nebraska legislature in support of its proposed route between 
washingtons dulles international airport and tokyo with a stop at 
chicagos ohare international airport 
american is seeking approval for an identical route and says it 
hopes economic and competitive issues hold more sway with the 
transportation department than politicians endorsements 
the letters of support have been sent to john j mathias a 
transportation department law judge who will conduct hearings 
expected to result by oct 1 in the selection of six new us 
gateways for nonstop flights to japan united said in a 
statement the hearings are scheduled to begin tuesday in 
washington

would be the us gateway for uniteds proposed flight 
united spokesman joe hopkins said a number of airlines are 
proposing multiple routes but united is concentrating on only one 
in what amounts to an allout effort to stop american from further 
humiliating united on its home turf 
hopkins said dallasbased american also has proposed a nonstop 
chicagotokyo route setting up a headtohead contest for the 
connection between the nations two largest airlines 
were putting all of our efforts into this one hopkins said 
american a subsidiary of amr corp pulled ahead of united in 
sales and market share last year to become the nations largest 
airline 
barry clark manager of americans international route strategy 
said that since united already is the leading transpacific carrier 
among us airlines competition would be better served if the 
transportation department awarded the route to american as for 
uniteds political connections we obviously hope its not that 
terribly important clark said in a phone interview 
american has been expanding and advertising aggressively in 
chicago during the past year trying to make a splash here while 
the management of uniteds parent ual corp has been caught up in 
a longrunning battle for control of the company 
uals board of directors recently agreed to sell the company to 
its employees for about 44 billion but financing for the deal 
hasnt yet been completed 
it is possible that neither airline would get the route since 
northwest airlines and japan air lines already fly between chicago 
and tokyo but it is virtually certain that united and american 
wont both get authority for the route 
supporting united are illinois gov james r thompson indiana 
gov evan bayh kentucky gov wallace g wilkinson nebraska gov 
kay a orr and virginia gov l douglas wilder 
other politicians backing uniteds bid include chicago mayor 
richard m daley the 24member illinois congressional delegation 
indianapolis mayor william h hudnut iii the nebraska legislature 
and the 12member virginia congressional delegation 
ual chairman stephen wolf said in a statement that the 
politicians speak not only for themselves but for the 
constituents in their areas with strong interest in a more 
efficient air link with japan

a coalition of physically handicapped and 
homebuilders complained on monday that proposed guidelines designed 
to guarantee disabled people access to apartments would price many 
of them out of the market 
however those assertions were promptly denied by the government 
and another group representing the disabled 
the guidelines were described as impractical inflexible and 
too costly in an analysis by the task force on handicap 
accessibility formed by the national coordinating council on spinal 
cord injury and the national association of home builders 
gordon mansfield assistant secretary of housing and urban 
development questioned the task force figures 
we are very concerned that we meet the intent of the law and 
make sure that secretary jack kemps priority on affordability on 
housing be paid attention to mansfield said 
the department of housing and urban development is required by 
the 1988 fair housing amendments to issue guidelines insuring 
disabled persons have easy access to new multifamily units first 
occupied after next march 13 
they affect such things as door hallway widths bathroom and 
walkin pantry sizes and grading and ramping of steeply sloped 
sites 
but the task force study said draft guidelines go far beyond 
the original intent of the fair housing legislation 
unless modified it said costs of building rental apartments 
and condominium and cooperative units will increase signficantly 
further slowing an already depressed multifamily industry and 
exacerbating the affordability crisis currently confronting 
millions of low and moderateincome households 
we estimate that the cost per unit of meeting huds proposed 
guidelines will range from 1300 to 3700 for walkup units and 
from 3200 to 4250 for mid to highrise units r jack 
powell president of the spinal cord injury council and executive 
director of the paralyzed veterans of america told a news 
conference 
since the added costs would be added to rents it would mean 
monthly increases of 13 to 37 for walkup units and of 32 to 43 
for mid or highrise units the coalitions study contended 
the coalition said its proposed guidelines would mean increases 
of between 7 and 26 for walkup units and 14 to 23 for mid or 
highrise apartments 
if huds design guidelines result in significant increases in 
the cost of housing they we have really defeated the purpose of 
the fair housing amendments and created another barrier to 
accessibilty powell said 
mansfield however said the hud guidelines would increase the 
cost of a 50000 apartment by 1 percent or 500 which both hud 
and the task force agree is within the cost that congress intended 
bonnie milstein cochair of the housing task force of the 
consortium for citizens with disabilities also said the 
coalitions claims were inaccurate 
ms milstein said the coalition figures include expenditures not 
required by the fair housing amendments and added that while the 
hud guidelines are far from perfect they are supported by her 
organization which includes the united cerebral palsy easter seals 
and the american foundation for the blind 
kent w colton home builders executive vice president also 
said uncertainty over the guidelines has severely disrupted the 
multifamily construction industry which finished 1989 with only 
373000 building starts down nearly 50 percent from 1985 and the 
lowest level since 1975 
mansfield said the guidelines are now being considered by the 
office of management and budget whose approval is required for many 
government regulations 
the home builders is a federation of more than 800 construction 
associations with more than 157000 members the coordinating 
council is comprised of 17 organizations associated with spinal 
cord injuries the largest is the paralyzed veterans with 14000 
members

hundreds of environmentalists demonstrated monday in the 
financial districts of new york and san francisco where postearth 
day demonstrators shattered windows at the bank of america 
authorities said 268 people were arrested in the two cities 
also in california handdelivered messages claimed 
responsibility monday for vandalism that cut power to some 92000 
pacific gas amp electric customers in santa cruz and watsonville 
in new york police arrested about 204 of an estimated 700 
demonstrators two protestors were charged with assaulting an 
officer and the rest with disorderly conduct according to police 
spokesmen 
the major corporations have committed a lot of crimes against 
nature said marc chernoff 30 a member of new yorks coalition 
for a nuclear free harbor its long overdue to place the blame 
where it directly belongs if the products that pollute were not 
made available people would not buy them 
trade on the new york stock exchange went on as scheduled and 
none of the protesters got inside except for getting up a little 
early its a pretty normal day said the exchanges senior vice 
president richard torrenzano 
at the pacific stock exchange in san francisco 49 people were 
arrested during a demonstration by 300 to 500 protesters that 
turned violent when some broke windows at bank of america threw 
golf balls rocks and eggs at police and overturned newsstands 
the exchange also opened on schedule although some employees 
were delayed 
police closed off two blocks of wall street to traffic and all 
pedestrians except those working there traffic elsewhere was 
disrupted during the morning and afternoon when protesters walked 
through lower manhattan streets 
the protest was organized by earth day wall street action which 
described itself as a coalition of 60 environmental organizations 
in the united states and canada it said it wanted to focus 
attention on institutions responsible for much of the ecological 
devastation which is destroying the planet 
i dont know why theyre protesting against wall street 
said james f dean 24 an auditor with jp morgan i dont 
think anyone is taking this seriously besides them 
i think its great that these guys in suits are stopping to 
hear us said debbie augustine 34 of loudon nh a member of 
the antinuclear power clamshell alliance 
a spokesman for the san francisco demonstrators daniel 
finkenthal of the earth day action coalition said the purpose of 
the protest there was to give the public an alternative to the 
corporatesponsored views of environmental action that preceded 
earth day 
yesterday these corporations came into our community and spent 
a lot of money on a media coup to try to convince the american 
public that environmental protection and reform was high on the 
corporate agenda but its the lowest priority finkenthal said 
in fact theyre spending more money on earth day promotion than 
they are on actual corporate reform and the environment 
the group that claimed responsibility for the two california 
outages called itself earth night action group and said the target 
was pacific gas amp electric a corporate earth rapist residents 
of santa cruz and watsonville were affected by the outages sunday 
and early monday caused by damage to power pgampe poles 
a young male caller to the associated press telephoned a few 
minutes after delivery of the message to ask if it had been 
received similar messages went to bay city news service and the 
san francisco examiner the caller refused to give his name or his 
telephone number
