most of the bald eagles that lost their 
nests when hurricane hugo swept through south carolina last fall 
have rebuilt their homes a wildlife expert said 
eighteen of 24 eagle pairs whose nests were destroyed have 
rebuilt them nearly all near their old nests thirty other eagles 
nests remained intact after the hurricane 
but tom murphy an eagle specialist with the state wildlife and 
marine resources department said that some of the trees in which 
nests lie are not very good nest trees were a little concerned 
that some of the nests might fall before incubation and chick 
rearing is over 
bald eagles an endangered species in the state nest here 
during the winter a pair mates for life and establishes a 
territory for nesting 
the bald eagle has shown promising progress in south carolina 
in 1976 murphy located 13 occupied nests last year he counted 52

a special grand jury on thursday indicted two city 
police officers on charges they conspired to cover up and 
misrepresent events surrounding a soured drug raid in which a 
detective was shot to death 
the charges against detective carlos a luna and sgt hugo r 
amate including perjury consiracy and filing false reports 
were the latest setback for police who have been blasted for their 
handling of the charles stuart murder case 
the fatal feb 17 1988 shooting of detective sherman griffith 
in the drug raid resulted in albert lewin being charged 
but a state judge dismissed the case after the elite antidrug 
squad failed to produce the informant it claimed led officers to 
the apartment where the shooting took place the supreme judicial 
court later voted 42 to reinstate the charges 
on thursday the suffolk county grand jury handed up 13 
indictments against luna and amate following an investigation by 
attorney general james m shannons criminal bureau 
if convicted of all charges the veteran officers face more than 
20 years in prison according to shannons spokeswoman mary 
breslauer luna and amate are to be arraigned march 5 in suffolk 
county superior court 
the indictment alleges that luna and amate agreed to carry out a 
coverup in the lewin case through perjury and by filing false 
reports shannon said in a statement 
luna testifying last month at a superior court hearing on a 
motion to dismiss charges against lewin said the 2yearold web 
of lies grew from the first affidavit used to obtain a search 
warrant for the raid 
luna said assistant district attorney francis omeara and his 
police superiors were told the informant used to obtain the search 
warrant was fictitious but conspired to cover it up to bring lewin 
to trial 
according to the affidavit detectives filed to obtain the search 
warrant an informant named john told him a 5foot 6inch hispanic 
drug dealer named stevie was selling cocaine from the apartment 
from the start a key hole in the prosecutions case was that 
lewin who is 6foot2 and jamaican didnt fit the description 
that discrepancy led the defense to ask that the informant be 
produced 
luna was charged thursday with filing false police reports 
within a month of the searchwarrant affidavit and two counts of 
perjury for testimony during a march 9 1988 probable cause hearing 
in the case against lewin 
he also faces 14 charges of filing false police reports between 
sept 27 and nov 25 1988 that detailed efforts to locate the 
fictitious informant and 10 separate counts of perjury in december 
1988 testimony in the lewin case 
amate who was part of lunas drug squad was charged with being 
an accessory after the fact in lunas alleged perjury in the 1988 
search warrant affidavit 
the indictment charges that amate knowing that luna falsely 
sworn to facts in the affidavit helped luna try to avoid being 
arrested shannons statement said 
amate was also charged with filing a false police report and 
committing perjury at a december 1988 hearing on the lewin case 
in the stuart case investigators believe stuart killed his 
pregnant wife carol then shot himself in the stomach last october 
police initially believed stuarts account that he and his wife 
were shot by a black man following an intensive manhunt police 
picked up william bennett who is black and identified him as the 
prime suspect 
stuart apparently jumped to his death from a boston bridge on 
jan 4 the same day police identified him as a suspect police 
have since been accused of racism in their hunt for a black suspect

researchers hope they have found a way to 
treat muscular dystrophy by altering the genetic makeup of weakened 
muscles 
scientists injected donor cells into the foot of a 9yearold 
muscular dystrophy patient at the university of tennessee on 
thursday testing a procedure called a myoblast transfer which may 
lead to medical treatments of genetically based diseases 
leon charash a new york child neurologist with the muscular 
dystrophy association said it apparently was the first time cells 
have been injected into living human tissue in hopes they would 
blend with dystrophic cells and restore them to normal 
if i were the family of this child and the thousands like him 
i would be heartened by this charash said i think it is the 
opening salvo to whats going to happen in the 1990s which i hope 
is going to be the successful treatment of many genetic disorders 
ive treated children with this illness for 30 years and 
people always ask what they can look forward to every one of these 
children die so you tell them you never know what science and 
research is going to do said charash chairman of the 
associations national medical advisory committee 
scientists at the university of tennesseememphis have selected 
11 young boys suffering from duchenne muscular dystrophy as test 
subjects 
on thursday doctors injected healthy immature muscle cells 
called myoblasts into a small muscle in one of the feet of sam 
looper a fourthgrader from pickens sc 
the injected muscle will be examined in 90 days to see if it is 
growing stronger and if its cells are producing a protein called 
dystrophin which is missing in muscle cells of duchenne sufferers 
if loopers body accepts the cell injection work will proceed with 
other test subjects 
similar tests are scheduled this year in san francisco boston 
and montreal previous tests have been conducted only on laboratory 
animals 
the research could lead within a year or two to medical 
treatments for improving and prolonging the lives of muscular 
dystrophy patients said gerald golden director of the 
universitys center for developmental disabilities 
by strengthening a few large muscles doctors may be able to keep 
a muscular dystrophy patient walking or breathing on his own for 
years longer than otherwise expected he said 
sufferers of duchenne muscular dystrophy a genetic disease that 
generally affects only boys rarely live past their 20s and are 
often confined to wheelchairs for much of their lives 
the tennessee research stems from laboratory work on mice 
conducted by peter law a professor of neurology who first 
published his theories on myoblast transfer in 1978 
it will not only prevent the abnormal cells from 
degenerating but it also will replenish lost cells law said 
to get donor cells for loopers injections doctors slightly 
injured a shoulder muscle of his father larry causing it to 
produce myoblasts a piece of the muscle was surgically removed and 
the immature cells were multiplied in the laboratory

will be open to all parties and any government said chief editor 
sinisa nikolic 
yugoslavia is changing its constitution legalizing a multiparty 
system and preparing for its first free elections in 50 years in

times have changed for petr zak a 
former secret police major 
just 13 months ago zak arrested dissident vaclav havel now 
havel is president and zak sits disconsolately at home under what 
he calls virtual house arrest 
like the thousands of others who toiled for the dreaded stb the 
czech acronym for the now disbanded secret police zak is under 
orders to stay home while an interior ministry commission mulls his 
fate 
in keeping with the philosophy of love and dignity preached by 
president havel its a mild punishment for years of repression zak 
helped carry out under the communist government 
the routine leaves zak and countless other former functionaries 
across eastern europe hours to ponder the fate that has wrenched 
power from their hands 
a year ago the burly balding zak confidently rasped out 
testimony that sent havel to jail for four months on charges of 
obstructing a police official in an interview with the associated 
press zak seemed deflated 
seated in his neat apartment in a shabby block on the outskirts 
of prague he groped to describe the change that has torn him from 
the 20 years of intelligence work he clearly relished 
it was a bit of a shock he finally conceded during an 
hourlong interview 
when unrest broke out after the nov 17 police attack on 
peaceful students some official structures did not act at all 
some went beyond their authority and the result was what 
happened he said 
as head of a 30member department dealing with what he calls 
extremism in independent initiatives zak was among those who 
best knew havel foreign minister jiri dienstbier and an array of 
other dissidents catapulted by revolution into positions of power 
in his classic bolshevik we lostthey won view this 
transformation was less surprising for zak than for a startled 
world watching czechoslovakias rapid makeover 
he had long gathered information by interrogating the 
dissidents listening to informers who he insists were unpaid 
and conducting surveillance easily observed by every visitor to 
dissidents homes 
zak claimed the dissidents long ago drew up a schedule of 
events for 1989 that foresaw the eventual assumption of power and 
hes sure things wouldnt have happened so fast without certain 
international support for his opponents 
there were a few mistakes on the communists side too he 
admitted one was a failure publicly to acknowledge or perhaps 
even play upon differences between the various dissident groups 
another was that we were forced more and more to carry out 
preventive measures and not our own intelligence work 
it was during these preventive measures the only term zak 
used to describe detention or interrogation that he spent hours 
in discussion with havel dienstbier and others puffing on 
petra cigarettes the cheap brand smoked by all three men 
if they had something constructive to say or something i 
didnt know before i was ready to accept or tolerate it zak 
said 
why then was no public action taken to open dialogue with the 
dissidents ask the politicians zak replied 
zak believes the communists should and will play a significant 
role in czechoslovakia he refused to talk about differences among 
the former leaders over what to do about the dissidents saying 
only that four groups fought for control 
equally loyally he refused to criticize the decision on jan 
16 1989 to arrest havel zak was one of those who detained the 
playwright after a small demonstration on wenceslas square which 
havel observed without taking part 
the arrest finally drove thousands of intellectuals who had 
refused to side openly with the dissidents into signing petitions 
for havels release 
it was the start of a revolt that moved with furious pace after 
nov 17 
many former communist functionaries have found th changes 
unbearable 
at least six people closely associated with the old rulers 
including two policemen and former slovak communist leader viliam 
salgovic long reputed to be a kgb agent have committed suicide 
since the revolution 
scattered reports in state media indicate many communists are 
being fired and finding it hard to get work at even the most menial 
tasks 
zak said his children met some resentment at school when they 
refused to join in certain actions of protest of the authorities 
and i suppose he said i was also punished by what is 
happening to me

it was clear to scott thomson 38 years ago 
long before television designer clothes and afterschool jobs 
began to claim the attention of american youngsters that the 
united states was losing ground in education 
thomson who this weekend ends his 10year reign as head of the 
nations largest association of school administrators says some of 
that ground has been regained but much remains to be done 
weve become so entertainmentoriented that weve forgotten 
that education is the main course and entertainment is the 
dessert he said 
i see happening now what i had hoped would have happened in 
the 60s and 70s that is placing education at a higher priority 
in the public mind 
thomson who as executive director of the national association 
of secondary school principals boosted membership in the 
organization from 33000 to 42000 says hes had some successes 
during his tenure but admits he still feels some frustrations 
i think i was much too ambitious to think i could have any 
kind of impact on the entire nation he said in a recent 
interview ive tried to do individually what i could to improve 
schools and raise standards and get everybody involved in 
learning 
thomson 61 said he foresaw us education problems after being 
in singapore on a rotary foundation scholarship in 195253 
i was so impressed with the commitment that singapore was 
making to education they were spending time and money all of 
society education was the no 1 priority 
thomson said he and his wife a teacher realized then how 
much trouble the united states was going to be in eventually if our 
kids had to compete against those kids who were burning up the 
track with their effort and attitude 
they were simply working harder and accomplishing more back in 
the 1950s than our kids were before we thought we had a problem 
today thomson points to the academic achievements of students 
in singapore and other asian nations reports show us students 
falling behind other industrialized nations academically 
particularly in math and science 
there is no question that education pays off he said 
as head of the association which begins its meeting friday in 
san diego thomson has warned of the negative impact the job market 
and television industry were having on learning in america 
a high demand for cheap labor and a premium on teenage 
consumption lure students into the job market said thomson who 
concluded after comparing the learning conditions in south korea 
and west germany with those in the united states that american 
society doesnt measure up 
thomson said surveys show a large percentage of us high school 
students work some as much as 20 hours or more a week 
in south korea students simply do not hold jobs while 
attending school and west germany students arent employed 
through all 13 years of school 
he said 71 percent of 13yearold korean students consistently 
watch science programs while only 37 percent of americans of 
similar age watch such programs 
thomson also tackled the issue of product advertising in the 
classroom aiming most of his criticism at whittle communications 
corp which has offered schools a daily 10minute news show with 
two minutes of advertising the schools receive free television 
monitors in return 
were very much opposed to channel one because we dont 
think the classroom setting is the proper place to buy levis or 
candy whatever he said 
thomson will continue his work with education in march becoming 
executive secretary of the national policy board for educational 
administration the only national group studying preparation and 
certification programs for school administrators 
the board plans to have a framework for preparation programs 
developed by june 1991 and launch a national certification board 
early in 1992 
thomson also will be a research professor at george mason 
university in fairfax va heading another project on preparation 
programs for school principals

homosexual literature long confined to the back 
corners of bookstores has come out of the closet with the 
emergence of aids today more than 200 titles involving aids have 
given the gay lifestyle broad exposure 
theres been an explosion of these books said david groff 
an editor at crown publishing in new york aids is the most real 
and potent metaphor for everything now it involves every issue of 
life and death and love 
most of the books revolve around those universal themes and the 
hardship of living under the threat of a modernday plague because 
aids has pervaded the homosexual world almost all current gay 
literature touches on the subject 
homosexual or bisexual men account for 60 percent of the cases 
of acquired immuned deficiency syndrome reported in the united 
states since 1981 
the biggest seller among aidsoriented books is still randy 
shilts 1987 chronicle of the aids epidemic and the band played 
on but novels or memoirs involving aids have become critical and 
financial successes 
armistead maupins sure of you a fictional account about a 
troubled married couple and the husbands gay business partner was 
on the new york times bestseller list in december paul monettes 
1988 book borrowed time a biography of the authors lover who 
died of aids was nominated for a national book critics circle 
award 
robert ferros 1988 novel second son the story of two men 
with aids who become lovers sold tens of thousands of copies 
as a result customers browsing through major mainstream 
bookstores such as buddenbrooks in boston come upon two shelves of 
gayoriented books displayed prominently 
the irony of the new legitimacy surrounding such books is not 
lost on sellers of homosexual literature 
aids has brought the gay lifestyle into the mainstream but i 
think its sad that its taken something like this to do it said 
buzz bryan editor of the lambda book report in washington which 
is associated with lambda rising one of the nations largest gay 
bookstores 
before the emergence of aids in 1981 most bookstores would not 
have considered displaying novels dealing solely and intimately 
with gay life on the same shelves as mainstream fiction 
sasha alyson owner of alyson publishing a small gay book house 
in boston said his imprint was the first to issue a book touching 
on aids called the advocates guide to gay health the 1982 
book had almost gone to press when a chapter on aids was added 
since then alyson said unsolicited aids memoirs have flooded 
his office 
a lot of them are very good and its hard to turn them down 
alyson said especially the ones written by parents 
a free book called you can do something about aids was 
published by alyson two years ago it is a collection of essays 
many by celebrities such as elizabeth taylor and over a million 
copies have been distributed at bookstores 
michael denneny senior editor at st martins press in new 
york said he believes aids was the final step in the publics 
acceptance of homosexuality the proliferation of aidsrelated 
books was a natural progression he said 
it was already happening somewhat with gay books hitting the 
mainstreamhe said now bookstores are more willing to accept 
them 
denneny also credits a new candor about homosexuality among 
publishing houses groff and denneny are the founding members of 
the publishing triangle a 700member group of gay and lesbian 
editors in the publishing industry 
ten years ago only three of us identified ourselves as gay 
said denneny when we formed the triangle i was flabbergasted to 
find out how many people joined

yeah we know that you were bored to tears by a googolplex of 
decadeending stories just two months ago yeah we know that 
decades are arbitrary guideposts that by one count the decade 
doesnt begin until next january 
but bar with us its official the 80s are history 
an inkling that we have entered the 1990s came when the parting 
of donald and ivana trump edged nelson mandela off the front page 
many readers asked the news media why are you so obsessed 
with these people whose main interest in life it seems is 
flaunting the goldplated faucets on their yacht is this some sort 
of trump fetish 
no no less than william norwich society columnist for the 
daily news explains that the trumps deserve walltowall coverage 
because they were the couple of the 80s a title they appear 
to have won by acclamation

cecilia briones a new york banker sees parallels between the 
rise and fall of the trumps and the course of wall street in the

order a perrier the fizzy drink of the 1980s a beverage that 
supplanted the lowly club soda as the pause that refreshed the 
ostentatious nearly 30 million gallons were guzzled in the united 
states in 1988 alone has been recalled in every one of the 120 
countries where it was distributed

ill just replace it ill suffer with evian said astrid 
sanai a paralegal at a manhattan law firm 
she and other healthconscious citizens of the 1980s have other 
reasons to be bummed to the max a phrase that never saw the end of 
the decade 
oat bran was the cholesterol eliminator of the 1980s in recent 
weeks scientists have said that this unappetizing foodstuff may 
protect the heart but only if it crowds eggs red meat and ice 
cream out of your diet not because it has some inherent 
anticholesterol qualities 
the running gravity boots and aerobics that marked the 1980s

four convicts have been released in less than a 
year by the courts or new evidence leading some attorneys to 
question how many more inmates may have been wrongly convicted in 
dallas 
but prosecutors and court watchers say the chances of that 
happening in dallas are no worse than anywhere else its the 
price one pays for justice 
we handle about 25000 felony cases a year and im sure that 
some mistakes are made norman kinne first assistant district 
attorney in dallas county said thursday i think the importance 
of it is not that mistakes are made but that we do everything to 
rectify them once its brought to our attention 
two inmates gained their freedom in just the last week another 
learned she would not be retried the fourth randall dale adams 
was within days of being executed for killing a dallas police 
officer before his sentenced was commuted in 1980 to life in 
prison he was released last march 
the question in my mind is how many more are out there 
asked joe cook president of the american civil liberties union in 
dallas its bothersome to me because it could happen to you to 
me or anyone else out there for that matter 
on wednesday prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss aggravated 
robbery charges against joyce ann brown 42 who was released last 
november after nine years in prison for a jewelry store robbery 
the texas court of criminal appeals overturned the conviction 
ruling that prosecutors should have known and should have told 
defense attorneys that a key witness against ms brown had been 
previously convicted for lying to police 
also wednesday gov bill clements signed a full pardon for 
michael anthony woten 36 who spent eight years in prison for a 
grocery store robbery authorities sought the pardon after the 
dallas times herald located his alibi witness another man has 
since admitted the crime 
last friday a judge released martin kimsey a 49yearold waco 
man who spent five years in prison before a federal prisoner came 
forward and took responsibility for a robbery kimsey was convicted 
of committing 
perhaps the most celebrated case was that of adams an ohio man 
who spent 12years behind bars for the 1976 shooting death of a 
police officer a state appeals court overturned the conviction and 
authorities chose not to seek a new trial much of the credit for 
adams release went to the film the thin blue line which 
detailed the case and alleged misconduct by prosecutors 
before adams came lenell geter an engineer who spent 16 months 
in prison for a restaurant robbery before his case was profiled on 
cbs 60 minutes and established the guilt of another man 
geters conviction was overturned and prosecutors backed away from 
retrying him in 1985 
kerry fitzgerald ms browns attorney said he thinks 
prosecutors have been more willing recently to take a second look 
at cases and backtrack if they must nonetheless he said citizens 
are becoming concerned 
people are getting scared of this he said theyre 
hearing that people are falsely accused and the person on the 
street im running into is saying that could be me whats going 
on 
geters attorney agreed that the das office appears to have 
softened 
last year they fought tooth and nail to keep all of these 
people in jail i think theyre handling the cases in a much more 
mature manner than they did last year bradley k lollar said 
dallas county criminal court judge larry baraka a former 
assistant district attorney is also less critical now of the das 
office last year he called for radical reform 
lets face it he said were dealing with human beings in 
a system that has its imperfections because it is manmade dallas 
county isnt the only place where innocent people are convicted

the battle of ballard locks escalated thursday as 
a marine biologist fired rubbertipped arrows at sea lions that 
threaten to devour a run of seagoing trout to extinction 
each winter state wildlife officials try to scare away as many 
as 40 of the federally protected marine mammals which have made 
the locks their home during the wild steelhead run 
the trout provide easy dining as they wait to pass through a 
fish ladder near the locks northwest of downtown seattle on their 
way to freshwater spawning streams 
sea lions have been gathering at the locks for the past eight 
years but theyve proved an increasing threat to the wild 
steelhead run in the past five eating 65 percent of last years 
run 
wildlife officials say lake washingtons wild steelhead run is 
in danger of vanishing because of the voracious mammals the wild 
steelhead is a stateprotected fish 
on thursday state marine biologist steve jeffries shot 
fiberglass arrows with hard rubber tips at the animals meanwhile 
underwater speakers blared a tape of sounds made by beluga whales 
and weddell seals creatures whose sounds arent normally heard by 
sea lions 
the goal is to get the sea lions to associate the unfamiliar 
sounds with an unpleasant bop on the blubber jeffries said 
if the conditioning works the sea lions should hurry away 
whenever the tapes are played although some reminder whacks may be 
needed 
the first four arrows brought startled reactions sending the 
victims rushing for deeper water 
the arrows travel at about 200 feet per second from a crossbow 
and cause some pain said state wildlife department spokesman bob 
byrne a line is attached to each arrow so it can be recovered 
the sea lions will be harassed with the tapes and arrows each 
morning through march when most of the wild steelhead will have 
passed through the fish ladder 
the tapes will be turned on whenever the beasts move within 150 
feet of the fishladder entrance and theyll be shot with the 
arrows when they get within 50 feet byrne said 
no one know how many thumpings may be needed to condition the 
sea lions or if the plan will work at all jeffries said similar 
methods have been used on bears to keep them away from campgrounds 
wildlife officials also plan to send 10 of the sea lions all 
males to the species breeding grounds on the channel islands off 
southern california 
sea lions are making news in california too with hundreds of 
them occupying at least 20 slips at the pier 39 yacht basin in san 
francisco theyre delighting the tourists but making life 
miserable for the marina and boat owners 
in the past federal and washington state wildlife officials 
have tried trapping the beasts screening the fish ladder with 
nets and harassing the sea lions with firecrackers and audio tapes 
of natural enemies all those efforts failed 
about three dozen of the sea lions were captured last winter and 
trucked to the southwest washington coast but most swam back 
within several days 
washington state has asked the federal government for a ruling 
on whether it would be legal to kill a protected marine mammal such 
as the sea lion if it is harming another protected species 
federal officials have said a ruling could be made later this 
year

microphone 
this seemingly bizarre campaign coverage is part of the japanese 
medias formula for fairness in accordance with the public 
officials election law 
with 953 candidates vying for seats in the lower house of 
parliament in an election sunday we cant show everybody in the 
news said takehiko motohashi spokesman for the prestigious 
public television network nhk 
the election law admonishes journalists not to contribute 
unfairly to the election or defeat of any candidate and it 
provides for prosecution of anyone who publishes a false story 
about a candidate 
for general coverage of rallies and other staged events nhk 
sometimes does not show the candidates face adhering to an 
allornone policy in covering candidates in any constituency 
similarly newspapers often make vague references to a 
conservative incumbent and print photos showing the backs of 
wouldbe parliamentarians 
the japan newspaper publishers and editors association insists 
there are no legal restrictions on campaign reporting but several 
reporters spoke of a tacit understanding 
masato kawahira chief of the domestic news section of the japan 
times a leading englishlanguage daily said when the official 
campaign begins we do not generally identify any of the candidates 
except the party leaders or former prime ministers 
when the paper does name a candidate it makes a point of naming 
all the others in the constituency in line with the election 
law he said 
a newspaper journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that if only major candidates in a certain district were 
identified fringe candidates would complain so although courts 
have ruled that news organs have the right to exclude fringe 
candidates from their coverage he said it is sometimes preferable 
to use no names at all 
last week former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who is 
seeking reelection filed a complaint with prosecutors against 
tadao uchida host of a morning talk show on tv asahi nakasone 
citing the election law charged that uchida made false statements 
about his campaign 
tv asahi declined to comment but following nakasones 
complaint takeshi maezawa ombudsman for the yomiuri shimbun 
japans largest daily said that unless a candidate has been 
arrested the news media must be very sensitive in publishing 
stories about the politician 
party leaders figure prominently in both tv and newspaper 
campaign coverage and cabinet members and other government 
officials continue to appear in the news this gives an advantage 
to major incumbents who can generate news at will 
unlike the united states where advertising holds center stage 
and is the biggest cost in political campaigns japan strictly 
limits candidates access to the mass media only political 
commercials sponsored by an entire party are permitted on tv and 
radio political newspaper ads are restricted to space the size of 
a playing card 
but even the humblest candidate gets to make at least one tv 
appearance by law 5 minutes are allotted free to each candidate 
on the airwaves of the public broadcasting system during the 
official twoweek campaign period 
every speech is delivered from the same blue podium in front of 
the same gray backdrop many of the officeseekers unfamiliar with 
the medium deliver their talks in a monotone one candidate from a 
fringe party lapsed into silent prayer presumably for votes 
if candidates are not satisfied with their access to the media 
yomiuris maezawa notes the law permits them to shout their 
names in the street as much as they like

after more than 30 years of 
marriage winnie mandela is finally learning to live with her 
husband 
ive been giving orders and now i have to take them mrs 
mandela said with a laugh during an interview thursday in the 
couples home in soweto 
mrs mandela a trained social worker married nelson mandela in 
1958 when she was 24 and he was a 40yearold african national 
congress leader on trial for treason 
he was acquitted in 1960 went underground a year later was 
arrested in 1962 and remained in prison until sunday during his 
more than 27 years in jail mrs mandela raised their two daughters 
alone and became a forceful and controversial antiapartheid 
activist in her own right 
now at 55 she said she is becoming a wife 
we never really lived together said mrs mandela so its 
like ive just got married and im learning the tricks of married 
life 
it is fun and very strange indeed at my age to wake up in the 
morning and i am told fetch my shirt what shirt have you 
prepared where are my shoes wheres my tie what should i 
wear she said reflecting traditional african society where the 
male in the family is the central figure 
it has been a marriage fraught with pain and frustration 
while mandela was doing hard labor on robben island prison his 
wife was allowed to visit once every six months and he could only 
receive one letter every six months after several years the 
international red cross succeeded in having privileges increased 
for mandela and his colleagues 
prison authorities refused to allow the mandelas contact visits 
until a few years ago regulations also forbade their daughters 
zindzi and zenani from seeing their father until they reached the 
age of 16 
all they did was just read about their father mrs mandela 
said i had to take them and introduce them to him when they 
turned 16 
the trauma of that type of meeting was so hurtful it was such 
a piercing reminder of who we are of who we are in the struggle 
for the liberation of our people she said you just felt a 
piercing dagger being struck right through your heart 
since his release mandela has often said his wife and family 
suffered more than him 
but mrs mandela said the sacrifices were worthwhile in that 
they could help their children and grandchildren escape the kind 
of racial hatred in the racial inferno of the south african 
apartheid system 
mrs mandela was under police restrictions almost continuously 
from 1963 to 1986 was arrested numerous times and held in solitary 
confinement for 17 months in 196970 
in recent years many activists called her mother of the 
nation 
but her questionable political judgment sometimes imperious 
style and reluctance to consult with antiapartheid groups led her 
into repeated conflict with both the white authorities and the 
black community 
longsimmering disputes boiled over last year when mrs 
mandelas bodyguards known as the mandela united soccer club were 
accused of abducting four youths and beating one to death 
nine people associated with the club are in custody for the 
death and the trial is to start shortly activists last year 
denounced mrs mandela and accused her bodyguards of waging a reign 
of terror 
she remained out of public view for several months but then 
began appearing again at antiapartheid rallies and has now 
returned to center stage with her husbands release

former president reagan gives videotaped 
testimony today for the irancontra trial of john poindexter whose 
lawyers are trying to destroy the former presidents claim that he 
knew little about the activities of overzealous aides 
reagans testimony at the federal courthouse in los angeles 
could be the toughest questioning he has faced about the scandal 
that caused heavy political damage to the final two years of his 
presidency 
with the press and public barred from attending reagan was 
being asked 154 questions plus followups that focus on his 
meetings with poindexter his former national security adviser 
then reagan faced crossexamination by irancontra prosecutors in 
questioning that could carry over until saturday 
poindexter goes on trial march 5 on charges of concealing from 
congress oliver norths assistance to the contras and lying about a 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
three years ago reagan portrayed himself as a president who was 
kept in the dark but poindexter contends he kept his boss fully 
informed about all aspects of the affair with the apparent 
exception of the diversion of iran arms sale money to the contras 
and that reagan authorized his activities 
reagan said early in 1987 that he hadnt known about secret 
bank accounts and diverted funds two products of the irancontra 
affair which he found personally distasteful he told the tower 
commission he didnt know the national security council staff was 
assisting the nicaraguan contras 
poindexter subsequently told congress however he believed 
reagan understood that col north was instrumental in keeping the 
contras supported without maybe understanding the details of 
exactly what he was doing 
details emerged at norths trial last year of reagans telephone 
call to the president of honduras to get the release of a seized 
shipment of ammunition destined for the contras 
also at norths trial an nsc staffer testified that cia 
director william casey said reagan had designated north as the 
principal point of reference for sustaining the contras during 
a congressional ban on military aid to the rebel force 
in 1987 poindexter said it was understandable that reagan 
didnt recall a briefing in which the national security adviser 
provided details about the contra support program 
but todays questions by poindexters lawyers sought to press 
the former president about his almostdaily meetings with his 
national security adviser 
on the agenda according to court papers 
the presidents knowledge of norths relationship with various 
individuals in the contra operation and the iran initiative 
whether poindexter told reagan of the status of richard secord 
who north enlisted to move supplies to the nicaraguan rebels and 
who operated the network of offshore accounts known as the 
enterprise to move money in the irancontra affair 
reagans discussions with poindexter regarding a chronology on 
a november 1985 hawk shipment that forms the basis of four of the 
five criminal charges against poindexter 
whether reagan advised poindexter to tell congressional 
committees they already had been given information about whether 
north was secretly assisting the contras the earlier responses 
were denials that north was raising money and providing military 
advice to the contras they led to former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlanes guilty plea to criminal charges of withholding 
information from congress 
reagan in a march 1987 an address to the nation said as 
angry as i may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge 
i am still accountable for those activities 
but secord who received two years probation for his role in 
the irancontra affair complained reagan has been hiding out 
i think its cowardly 
i think he should have stood up and taken the heat just as 
previous presidents have done said secord who pleaded guilty to 
making a false statement in connection with proceeds from the 
enterprise used to benefit north 
on thursday us district judge harold greene rejected a 
request by news organizations to attend todays deposition 
however greene said he would order the videotape released within a 
few days after editing to remove material deemed to touch on 
classified matters

when richard nixon broke the ice with 
communist china in 1972 reversing a frosty us policy of 
isolation it was said by the sages in washington that only a 
strong president could take such a step 
that wisdom might be applied to mikhail gorbachev in his 
startling reversal of policy on us and soviet troop levels in 
europe and on unification of east and west germany 
that is the view at least of some state department officials 
who had a frontrow seat as gorbachev reversed soviet policy on 
both fronts this week the key to their analysis is what transpired 
at the meeting of the central committee of the communist party 
before the policy shifts 
there gorbachev led the party into abrogating the constitutional 
provision that gives the party a monopoly on political power this 
sets the stage for contested elections and a thorough overhaul of 
the soviet system 
from the historic meeting gorbachev went into talks with 
secretary of state james a baker iii refusing in a brief exchange 
with reporters to commit himself to running for reelection to the 
presidency as a communist 
lets wait and see gorbachev said before the session that 
led by tuesday to soviet approval of the us framework for german 
unification and to soviet acceptance of a us manpower advantage 
in europe 
the us plan gives east germany and west germany wide latitude 
in shaping the united country that will begin to emerge soon after 
march 18 national elections in east germany the united states 
britain france and the soviet union would have only a supervisory 
role and only on external issues 
the soviets capacity to restrain any resurgence of german 
nationalism will be doubly submerged 
first the us plan would leave most sovereign decisions to the 
germans second the soviets supervisory role would be filtered 
through joint decisions by the four countries 
gorbachev tipped his hand a little about changing his mind in 
late january when he acknowledged the gathering force of german 
determination to end 45 years of division saying time itself is 
having an impact on the process and lending dynamism to it 
incredibly by tuesday the soviets had agreed to a framework 
that could put the territory of east germany into nato as part of a 
merged single state although west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher is dangling the possibility that western 
troops would not be deployed in the area 
even if nato and the merged germany took that step the shift in 
soviet policy still would amount to an enormous reversal by the 
kremlin 
gorbachevs switch on us and soviet troop ceilings came at the 
open skies conference in ottawa only a few days after he 
countered president bushs imbalanced jan 31 proposal with options 
of equal ceilings of us and soviet troops on foreign soil in 
europe 
as the bush administration hesitated gorbachev gave in and 
agreed to 195000 soldiers on both sides in central europe and an 
additional 30000 americans outside the zone 
it might have been a canny move by the soviet leader 
he is locking in a withdrawal of 80000 us soldiers from 
europe to get down to the new ceilings with leverage he might not 
have a year from now by then far fewer soviet troops than the 
current force of about 600000 are apt to be in europe as 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland all press for soviet withdrawal 
strategy apart though the state department view is that 
gorbachev is acting out of strength not out of weakness 
referring to his victories at the central committee meeting one 
official commented what one sees in gorbachev now is someone who 
clearly controls all the major levers of power there is no 
question when you look at the outcome of this plenum that he is 
politically strengthened 
as the official who demanded anonymity sizes up gorbachevs 
situation the soviet leaders successes in reaching agreements 
with the united states will strengthen his hand at the coming party 
congress 
there gorbachev will move to institute political reform and 
build up the presidency he has a stake in continuing to be 
successful on the outside and to show that he is a master and can 
manage the us relationship very well the official said 
the irony is that while gorbachev accrues even more political 
power he will not be able to blame opponents in the central 
committee or the politburo if he cannot solve the soviet unions 
economic problems

cable television customers may soon find 
theyre getting better service faster installation service calls 
and refunds but the industry says it could cost them higher rates 
the national cable television association in announcing the new 
public relations campaign thursday said cable companies may have 
to add personnel and costly new equipment and facilities 
if customers want highquality programming and state of 
the art plants sure its going to cost them something said 
james mooney ncta president but i think it will not be a 
significant upward boost in rates 
the voluntary customer service guidelines were adopted by the 
ncta board of directors on wednesday in boca raton fla 
john goddard president of viacom cable and chairman of the 
associations customer relations committee said it would cost his 
company about 1 million not including additional personnel 
viacom had about 11 million subscribers at the beginning of 1989 
an official at the nations largest cable company 
telecommunications inc said in a telephone interview from denver 
that the company will implement the guidelines and expects to 
absorb any implementing costs 
there are some costs associated with it but we expect them to 
be offset by an increased customer base said anne draper tcis 
director of community affairs 
the guidelines do not address the issue of monthly rates which 
have risen sharply in some cases since cable tv essentially was 
deregulated in 1987 
mooney said prices stabilized last year at about the rate of 
inflation or below nonetheless nearly a score of cable 
reregulation bills have been introduced in congress by members who 
have been besieged by constituents complaining of poor cable 
service and high rates 
in all candor we can say that a significant number of our 
companies havent gotten to the point where customer service is 
adequate mooney said 
he rejected assertions that cable companies should be able to 
provide a high level of customer service without adopting programs 
that could drive rates higher 
these problems are characteristic of any industry that has 
developed as rapidly as this one has mooney said 
cable officials hope the standards can be adopted nationwide by 
july 1991 the standards say 
more customer service representatives will be hired so 
telephone calls can be answered within 30 seconds including 
waiting time and transfers and automated answering systems will 
limit the number of rings to four this standard should be achieved 
90 percent of the time 
under normal circumstances a customer will receive a busy 
signal less than 3 percent of the time a cable company office is 
open 
standard installations will be performed within seven business 
days 
the cable operator will respond to service interruptions 
promptly certainly within 24 hours in situations not beyond the 
cable companys control other service problems will be responded 
to within 36 hours during the normal work week 
morning afternoon and allday appointment estimates should be 
established 
if an installer or technician is running late an attempt will 
be made to contact the customer to set up a new appointment 
customers should be given 30 days notice of rate increases 
bills should state clearly what services a customer is 
receiving and how much they cost 
ncta will not try to enforce the guidelines out of antitrust 
concerns but mooney said they likely would be written into 
franchising agreements between cable companies and local 
governments 
rep matthew j rinaldo rnj ranking minority member of the 
house energy and commerce telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee applauded the guidelines saying cable executives 
at last recognize that either they serve the public better or 
they face the prospect of dealing with all the costs headaches and 
delays of a federal bureaucracy telling them what to do

the planes intended flight path he said 
a fisherman in the area pulled up some debris from the plane in 
a fishing net about a week ago and contacted new england airlines 
bendokas said he said subsequent investigations by divers during 
the past few days positively identified the aircraft 
asked whether the wreckage will provide clues to the cause of 
the crash bendokas himself a licensed pilot said no one 
knows everyone hopes so 
aboard the plane were pilot john beck jr and passengers judy 
johnson of essex falls nj shirley wood of block island david 
sulle of block island duane lane and his son darrell of

the election of marion s barry jr as mayor 
of the nations capital was celebrated throughout black america 
the son of a mississippi sharecropper a scarred veteran of the 
civil rights movement he had soared to what he long preached as 
its ultimate goal political power 
now 12 years later many see him not as the portrayer of 
promise but of betrayal 
though the energized hope which barry bore into the mayors 
office had long since lost its gleam it virtually went up in smoke 
with a few videotaped puffs on a cocaine pipe in an fbi sting 
operation a month ago 
the charge then was a single misdemeanor count but many 
contended the arrest showed that barry 53 had reneged upon his 
obligation to wage war on the drug dealers who have brought so much 
violence and pain to the capital and its children 
on thursday a federal grand jury unfurled a longer list of 
charges three felony counts for allegedly lying about his drug 
use and five more misdemeanor counts for alleged possession 
for years there had been questions about whether barry a former 
lieutenant to martin luther king jr had been corrupted by the 
power he sought since his days of chopping cotton and waiting 
tables but barry pronounced himself invincible to his critics 
whether in or out of law enforcement 
what i have done he told a los angeles times reporter in a 
memorable barroom interview just two months ago nobody knows 
about because i dont get caught 
and for more than a decade it seemed he was invincible he was 
twice reelected using as his base a city payroll which included 
one out of every 12 residents he courted his predominantly black 
constituency by steering housing projects jobs programs and 
government contracts their way 
that support did not falter even as basic municipal services 
remained in disarray despite the huge payroll three times the 
size on a per capita basis of the city government of los angeles 
to this day residents can spend hours waiting for a simple license 
renewal and days to have their streets cleared of snow 
nor was the mayor troubled by matters that would do in other 
politicians he frequented topless bars and cruised around town in 
his blue limousine paying nocturnal visits to a variety of people 
who ordinarily wouldnt be expected to have a mayor drop by known 
drug dealers lowgrade city workers young women he made mystery 
trips to tropical spots sometimes in the company of a woman not 
his wife including one rasheeda moore who eventually turned 
against him by working for the fbi 
a previous wife mary treadwell and several close associates 
including two deputy mayors went to prison over various charges of 
misconduct one aide bought the mayors second wife effi a mink 
coat with city funds repaid by barry after the episode was 
publicized 
through all of that barry would simply refuse to answer the 
more troublesome questions about his behavior instead he 
suggested they came from a racist media and a republican 
administration eager to return control of the city to a white 
congress many washingtonians believed him and when barry 
scheduled an announcement last month that he would run for a fourth 
term few were prepared to bet against him 
that changed in a heartbeat when ms moore a former 
highfashion model in trouble with the law called him and invited 
him to her room in the vista international hotel next door were 
the fbi agents who watched his every move and videotaped them 
four days later on the day he was to declare his renewed 
candidacy barry instead entered st timothys episcopal church 
near his home and in a confession to his public and an apology to 
his wife he acknowledged he had succumbed to weaknesses 
how i wish i could trade this hour he declared in tears 
this time ive come face to face with my deepest human 
failures 
with that barry was off to a drug treatment center in florida 
when he will return remains uncertain meanwhile the grand jury 
returned on thursday

although most us airliner flights will be 
free of tobacco smoke after next week crewmembers and frequent 
fliers still face a health danger from cosmic radiation a new 
government study says 
the transportation department study of airliner cabin 
environment released thursday indicates radiation from the sun and 
stars poses a cancer risk comparable to that faced by nonsmokers in 
a plane where smoking is allowed 
the study sent to congress earlier this week recommends that 
airlines schedule cabin crews in ways that will reduce their risk 
to cosmic rays especially those crews who regularly fly near the 
north pole and south pole or at higher altitudes 
it also recommends a total smoking ban but that was superceded 
by congressional action that imposed a ban on all flights of six 
hours or less beginning feb 25 
the study reflects uncertainty over the effects of low doses of 
radiation but attempts to measure the possible risk to airliner 
crews business travelers and passengers who fly only infrequently 
the study included scientific monitoring of 69 smoking and 23 
nonsmoking flights between april and june 1989 it found some risk 
to nonsmoking crew and passengers on flights where smoking is 
allowed 
it estimated that about four nonsmoking crew members would have 
died of premature lung cancer as a result of cabin exposure over 
the next 20 years assuming each crew member flies about 960 hours 
a year 
one death every two to four years would have occurred among 
nonsmoking passengers exposed for 30 years the study estimated 
researchers did not monitor cosmic radiation levels but made 
health risk estimates based on previously gathered data it 
analyzed several flight paths using information gathered in a 
united nations study of atomic radiation 
it estimates that the lifetime cancer risk due to cosmic 
radiation for airline crew members who fly 960 hours a year would 
be from five to 61 deaths for every 100000 individuals in 20 years 
of flying it also notes some risk to frequent fliers and to the 
fetuses of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy 
the study found no health risk from bacteria or fungi in airline 
cabins

fertilizer costs are rising but probably wont 
be as high as they were a year ago when farmers take to the fields 
this spring according to an agriculture department report 
a preliminary report released thursday by the departments 
economic research service said fertilizer prices may be up 4 
percent from last fall but despite the increase spring prices may 
be down about 4 percent from yearearlier levels 
planted areas of corn and wheat the major fertilizerusing 
crops will probably increase by 1 percent to 5 percent the 
report said decreases in planted acreage are anticipated for 
soybeans 
analysts said supplies of nitrogen phosphate and potash should 
be enough to meet 1990 requirements although greater nitrogen 
imports will more than make up for lower domestic production 
nitrogen prices will likely show the greatest increase since 
last fall as domestic supplies tighten the report said 
phosphate supplies should be sufficient to meet demand at 
moderately higher prices than last fall even with a slight 
reduction in domestic production 
potash inventories are expected to be available at stable to 
slightly lower prices than last fall if price cuts initiated by 
canadian producers continue the report said 
on a global basis the use of plant nutrients rose about 3 
percent last year and growth in fertilizer production use and 
trade will probably continue in the 1990s the report said 
energy prices at the farm will probably remain at or perhaps 
slightly above 1989 levels due to the anticipated steady price of 
imported crude oil the report said however total expenditures 
by farmers may rise 46 percent this year to 909 billion because 
of increases in crop plantings and a modest rise in irrigation 
farm machinery sales rose an estimated 570 million in 1989 to 
66 billion the report said lower farm debt and higher farmland 
values helped strengthen sales last year 
sales of fourwheeldrive tractors were up 52 percent in 1989 
and are forecast to rise another 45 percent this year

a new program has been designed by the 
agriculture department to help curb the spread of a foodpoisoning 
organism salmonella enteritidis in poultry flocks that produce 
table eggs for consumers 
the organism which has a number of strains has been identified 
with food poisoning in humans who have consumed contaminated eggs 
that were improperly cooked 
assistant secretary jo ann r smith said thursday that the 68 
million control program will focus on testing and certification of 
breeding flocks that produce the tableegg layers and on tracing 
back and testing commercial egg flocks if and when they are 
implicated in human cases of s enteritidis 
the interstate movement of chickens eggs and associated 
articles from flocks infected or associated with the bacteria will 
be restricted she said 
smith said s enteritidis is a growing problem in the nations 
32 billion egg industry and has emerged as a serious public 
health concern as well she said strains of the organism are 
entrenched in northeastern and midatlantic states and are 
expanding into the midwest and northwest 
in humans the bacteria can cause cramps diarrhea fever and 
sometimes nausea and vomiting five to 72 hours after eating 
contaminated food smith said some people such as the elderly or 
those with poor immune systems can suffer serious and 
lifethreatening effects from eating contaminated eggs or other 
food 
an interim rule will put the program into effect as of feb 16 
smith said public comments on the plan docket no 88161 will be 
accepted through april 17 those can be sent to chief regulatory 
analysis and development ppd aphis usda room 866 federal

the agriculture department says price supports 
for peanuts grown under 1990 quotas will be 63147 per ton an 
increase of 1560 from last year 
officials said thursday that the increase was mandated by law 
which requires annual adjustments in the national support level for 
quotatype peanuts based on costs of production as costs increase 
so does the peanut support level 
production of nonquota peanuts which can be grown for peanut 
oil and meal and for export will be supported at 14975 per ton 
unchanged from last year 
the bush administration has asked congress to eliminate the 
escalator in the peanut support formula and put the program in line 
with other farm commodity supports

president bushs trip to the colombian drug 
summit produced some footnotes for the history books about a 
topsyturvy helicopter ride an unabashed attempt at flattery and 
utter rejection 
and not to be overlooked was this declaration from bush im 
not fuming 
the trip to cartagena to plot antidrug strategy got off to an 
unusual start when bush decided to sleep overnight wednesday on air 
force one in a guarded airport hangar so he wouldnt have to wake 
up for a predawn departure 
the plane lifted off with bush in bed just before landing in 
colombia the refreshed president visited the planes media section 
to express unhappiness about news stories emphasizing his penchant 
for secrecy 
bush said he was going to stop talking to the press because 
im not going to be burned for holding out information doing 
something deceptive 
he said i think there are too many press conferences its 
not good it overdoes it its overexposure to the thing 
after his plane landed at barranquilla bush switched to a 
helicopter for the 60mile ride to the drug summit at cartagena it 
was a strange 45minute journey 
the swarm of five helicopters carrying bush members of his 
entourage and the media moved out fast and flew low rolling and 
weaving over marshes and pastures scaring up herds of cattle and 
sending horses running 
this kind of flight pattern is known as contour flying a 
lowlevel evasion tactic used to elude attack what else would you 
do in a country wracked by drug violence 
four of the helicopters landed suddenly from the opposite 
direction the fifth helicopter this one carrying bush roared in 
for a landing 
within minutes bush was greeting the leaders of colombia peru 
and bolivia 
youre a big man bush told one tall broadshouldered man 
youre a big guy 
the target of his flattery was peruvian president alan garcia a 
mercurial leader who had threatened to throw a monkey wrench into 
the summit 
first garcia declared he would boycott the meeting to protest 
the us invasion of panama 
then to the consternation of us officials garcia said he was 
bringing some coca growers with him coca is the plant used to make 
cocaine and garcia wanted to make the point that coca growers need 
economic help to switch to legal crops 
against that background it was uncertain how the two presidents 
would get along 
when they finally came face to face bush turned on the charm 
glad to meet you at last bush told garcia and followed up 
by commenting on garcias stature 
when garcia replied bush apologized that my spanish isnt so 
good but it was all smiles between the two leaders 
what about the coca growers 
secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters he didnt 
see them but he tossed the question to peruvian prime minister 
guillermo larco cox sitting next to him at a conference table 
they were not allowed to come to the meeting the prime 
minister said 
american officials said the growers had been exiled to a 
cartagena hotel away from the summit site total rejection 
separately bush was asked by reporters if he had seen any coca 
growers 
he refused to answer instead bush wanted to talk about press 
stories written about his remarks earlier in the day warning that 
he was going to clam up on the media 
it was all a misunderstanding bush said if you tell the 
media im not fuming ill answer about whether he had seen any 
coca growers 
he got a quick agreement and offered a brief answer 
havent seen any bush said with that he left for more 
drug talks

here is the text of the statement issued by 
washington mayor marion s barry jr 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
todays indictment does not surprise me at all because it 
represents a continuation of the political lynching and excesses of 
the justice department in this multiyear multimilliondollar 
effort to investigate me and the barry administration 
i am not surprised in fact if it has to happen im glad its 
now rather than later and i am relieved that the indictment has 
finally been issued and the suspense has ended all of the 
calculated carefully orchestrated rumors and leaks by the federal 
government have put a damper on the city and its people but now 
that we will be moving into the courtroom which is where this 
case should be tried not in the press i am relieved i know that 
when a trial is held i will be exonerated 
until that time i urge the public to hold fast to our 
democratic principle that presumes a person to be innocent until 
proven guilty in a court of law i further ask that members of the 
media exercise restraint and professionalism in not seeking to 
interview me or my family about this matter that now clearly will 
be in the hands of the court i will have nothing to say about this 
case outside the courtroom 
as i continue to undergo the healing of my mind body and soul 
i want to assure the residents of washington dc that i am not 
considering resignation an indictment is not a finding of guilty 
it is simply a formal charge based on the presentation of only one 
side of the evidence now i have the right to defend myself 
against that charge 
i also want to tell you that i am firmly committed to continuing 
to focus on my recovery from the disease of alcoholism and its 
attendant problems a disease that affects millions of americans 
including such notable and courageous individuals as former first 
lady betty ford 
i have derived great benefit from my stay here at the alcohol 
rehabilitation center in florida and i know that recovery is a 
lifelong process to which i have dedicated myself 
but for now as i go through this healing process i want to 
make sure that my wife and our son are psychologically and 
emotionally comfortable after all that we have through and will be 
going through as a family i do not want them badgered and dogged 
at every turn they do not suffer from the disease i do any 
consequences should be mine to bear not theirs 
i am extremely proud of the way my management team headed by 
city administrator carol thompson has handled the affairs of 
government in my absence i know this budget period is a tough time 
for carol my staff director maudine cooper deputy mayors bob 
pohlman and wylie williams director of special services tina 
smith and the agency directors who must explain the serious 
realities of the citys financial picture during an election year 
i know citizens need assurance that their needs will be met and 
that the same high quality government services will continue 
uninterrupted in spite of the meanspirited and calculating people 
who would like to see us fail as a local government i put a strong 
management team in place and i can reassure you that government is 
operating smoothly efficiently and effectively and under the 
barry philosophy of quality compassionate competent and caring 
service 
i want to say to all that when i decided to go away to deal with 
my health concerns my political decisions were placed on hold and 
will be determined within the next 60 days anita bonds is the only 
person designated and authorized by me to speak on political 
matters 
my lawyer kenneth mundy and i are now preparing to go to court 
and win this case i will have no announcement about my political 
future at this point 
i hope the media will respect my right to continue my recovery 
in private and allow me to obtain the full benefit of treatment 
for this disease during my absence i urge you to respect the 
rights of my wife and my son to lead private lives as we go forward 
during this highly political legal procedure i ask that you 
confine your questions about the legal case to my attorney any 
other questions about me should be directed to my press secretary 
lurma rackley 
to all of you who continue to remember me my family and this 
city in your prayers i sincerely thank you

following are highlights of the 
13page communique signed by the presidents of the united states 
colombia peru and bolivia to fight illicit drugs 
the nations pledged to work together toward dynamic programs 
to fight the flow of drugs from the andean nations to the united 
states 
the statement broke no new ground but sounded a strong theme of 
cooperation 
the parties recognize that trafficking in illicit drugs has a 
negative longterm impact on their economies it asserted 
specifically the presidents agreed 
they would cooperate in exchanging information and 
intelligence but in an apparent foreclosure of the use of us 
military forces in the region the communique asserted each 
country may involve its armed forces in this fight within its own 
national territory 
still the united states agreed to provide increased equipment 
and training to the law enforcement agencies and the militaries of 
the andean parties 
they will call for a world conference against illicit drug 
trafficking in 1991 and hold a highlevel followup to thursdays 
fournation session within six months 
the united states would help train andean farmers on how to 
switch to other crops to substitute for the lucrative coca harvest 
bush will request an economic aid package of an unspecified 
amount from congress for fiscal 1991 to 1994 to help offset 
significant immediate and longterm costs caused by the loss 
of the coca crop in the three andean countries the president has 
earlier pledged a total of 22 billion in economic and military 
antidrug assistance for the andean nations over five years 
the united states will try to open its markets more to south 
american goods and to provide balanceofpayments assistance to 
help stabilize the economies of the drugproduction countries 
which have rampant inflation 
the bush administration will work for more private investment 
in the andean nations 
the four countries will sponsor programs to strengthen public 
awareness of drug problems 
the parties reaffirm their will to fight drug trafficking in a 
comprehensive manner attacking all facets of the trade production 
transportation and consumption the statement said 
on the sensitive issue of military involvement the communique 
said the control of illegal trafficking is essentially a law 
enforcement matter rather than a military one 
however it says that because of the magnitude of the 
problem the armed forces in each of these countries within 
their own territory and national jurisdictions may also 
participate 
the statement also calls for better intelligencegathering 
cooperation stepped up enforcement more control of chemicals used 
to manufacture drugs tighter restrictions on weapons planes 
ships explosives and communications equipment used in drug 
trafficking 
all the parties agreed to strengthen controls over the 
movement of illegal weapons 
the andean nations have complained that semiautomatic weapons 
made in the united states are finding their way into the hands of 
drug traffickers however bush thus far has resisted proposals to 
change us laws to further restrict the manufacture and export of 
such firearms 
in addition to the multilateral communique the united states 
reached six bilateral agreements with the other countries those 
incorporate 
an agreement with bolivia in which the state department will 
help diminish that flow of us light arms and other arms to drug 
traffickers in the andean countries by requiring weapons 
exporters to obtain an import certificate from the importing 
government before the united states will issue an export license 
the administration also committed to further discussions to 
determine what weapons are covered by the directive and to 
pursuing discussion with other governments concerned about 
limiting the flow of us weapons to illegitimate end users in the 
andean countries 
an extradition agreement with peru asserting that narcotics 
traffickers are extraditable under perus 1889 extradition treaty 
with the united states 
an agreement with peru to exchange tax records bank statements 
and other information to uncover drug profiteering and money 
laundering it also calls for prosecution of tax evasion to catch 
drug dealers and exchanges of technical information to improve tax 
compliance 
an agreement with bolivia pledging cooperation and 
informationsharing to crack down on illegal us exports of 
chemicals used to manufacture cocaine the countries vowed to 
promptly investigate the destination of such chemicals and seize 
those destined for illicit points the agreement requires domestic 
legislation if needed to provide for such seizure 
public awareness agreements with peru and bolivia to build 
public support against narcotics production distribution and use 
they also call for establishment of a computerized data base on 
antidrug activities and joint sponsorship of mass media projects 
to promote informationsharing about drug problems and solutions

the bush administration is moving forward with 
plans to borrow as much as 44 billion more this year to finance 
its savings and loan bailout but its leaving unresolved the 
politically touchy question of how the borrowing will affect the 
budget deficit 
a treasury departmentled board overseeing the resolution trust 
corp is expected to formally approve the plan as soon as today 
oversight board staff members on thursday told congressional 
aides the borrowing could start at the end of this month total as 
much as 11 billion by the end of march and 44 billion by the end 
of the year 
the private briefings on capitol hill followed a ruling from the 
justice department that the rtc created to dispose of failed 
thrifts may legally borrow from the federal financing bank a 
conduit for funneling treasury money to government agencies 
sampl bailout legislation enacted in august provided 50 billion 
through next year to cover the losses in failed thrift 
institutions but the rtc needs to temporarily borrow as much as 
100 billion more 
the borrowing called working capital would be repaid as 
the government sold loans real estate and other assets inherited 
from failed thrifts 
however the politically sensitive issue of what impact the 
borrowing will have on the budget deficit remains up in the air 
the office of management and budget has the authority to decide 
how to account for the borrowing but it plans to consult with 
congress before making the decision according to omb spokeswoman 
barbara clay 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the banking and budget 
committees and other congressional democrats say they are worried 
the administration will allow the deficit to balloon for the 
current fiscal year now that its too late to trigger automatic 
spending cuts under the grammrudman law 
later when sampl assets are sold and the working capital is 
repaid it would cut the budget deficit number and hide the true 
scope of government spending the democrats maintain 
its the worst type of budget gimmickry schumer said but 
it is a juicy morsel in the eyes of any person trying to make it 
look like the budget was balanced 
meanwhile economists said the extra treasury borrowing could 
at least temporarily drive up shortterm interest rates 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york said consumers with adjustablerate 
home mortgages or home equity loans tied to the oneyear treasury 
bill may see their payments take a jump 
however economist elliott platt of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities corp said any upset in interest rates would be 
shortlived 
apart from a little shortterm friction theres probably 
going to be relatively little effect on interest rates overall 
he said 
meanwhile rtc oversight staff members said at least for now 
two other more expensive methods of raising working capital wont 
be used 
in one the government would solicit large 
governmentguaranteed deposits for failed thrifts from 
institutional investors such as pension funds in the other the 
administration would borrow through the federal home loan bank 
system the quasigovernmental financing arm of the sampl industry 
also they said the 44 billion estimate for working capital in 
1990 does not include additional funds that could be used to pay 
off highcost deposits in failed thrifts controlled by the 
government the 11 billion estimate for this quarter includes 
about 3 billion to pay off highcost deposits they said

the head of the coast guard says hes 
satisfied with the cleanup of an oil spill off the california coast 
despite a congressmans contention the service overstated its 
readiness 
im delighted with the cleanup adm paul a yost said 
thursday in an interview ill stand by the cleanup 
yost made the comment after rep george miller dcalif 
charged that yost last august said the coast guard was capable of 
cleaning up far more than it actually did at the california spill 
miller said yost told him in a letter that under ideal 
conditions 161500 barrels of oil would have been recovered within 
72 hours of a spill off southern california 
miller said the cleanup of the feb 7 spill by the american 
trader although much smaller than that of the exxon valdez in 
alaska last march reached only 2762 barrels four days later 2 
percent of what the coast guard had estimated 
the american trader spilled 400000 gallons about 9500 
barrels of crude oil as it tried to moor about two miles 
offshore the exxon valdez spilled more than 10 million gallons of 
crude when it went aground 
i think everything that could be mobilized was mobilized here 
to deal with it miller said of the california spill adding that 
weather and other conditions were as close to ideal for a cleanup 
as could be expected 
all evidence would suggest that if you had a spill the size of 
the exxon valdez off the huntington beach wed probably be lynching 
the executives of british petroleum at this time miller said 
referring to the company that chartered the american trader 
miller had asked the coast guard for its appraisal of the 
cleanup capabilities off the california coast as a result of the 
exxon valdez disaster the nations worst oil spill yost said that 
model cannot be applied to the current spill 
he asked for a benchmark yost said i said in my answer 
this was an unrealistic situation 
yost said the two situations cant be compared because skimming 
would be much easier with a larger spill since the oil lies on the 
ocean in much thicker layers 
he added that in an ideal situation the water would be placid 
while in the california situation there was a slight chop 
we picked up 30 percent he said thats a higher 
percentage of oil slick than in any large spill in history 
miller chairman of the house interior subcommittee on water 
power and offshore energy resources is trying to win passage of 
oil spill liability legislation house and senate negotiators are 
working on a compromise measure 
the coast guard participates in and supervises oil spill 
cleanups but state and local governments and private industry 
provide most of the capability resources include skimmers barges 
helicopters airplanes fire booms and pumps

president bush and three latin 
american leaders agreed on a new drugfighting strategy but steered 
away from a disputed us initiative during a tightly guarded 
oneday summit 
bush said he and the leaders of the three largest 
cocaineproducing nations formed the first antidrug cartel 
but a joint communique vowing closer coordination on the war on 
drugs apparently ruled out expanding the use of us military force 
in bolivia colombia and peru to combat cocaine traffickers 
each country may involve its armed forces in this fight in its 
own territory said the communique signed by bush bolivias 
jaime paz zamora colombias virgilio barco and perus alan garcia 
latin leaders had opposed a us plan to send a naval force to 
interdict cocaine shipments in the international waters off 
colombias coast 
at the summit bush promised to step up the fight against us 
drug use and outlined emergency programs to help offset the 
weakening of perus and bolivias economies as they fight to reduce 
and eventually eliminate cultivation of coca used to make cocaine 
but garcia later questioned if the united states could come up 
with the money to pay for such expensive programs wheres the 
beef he asked at the concluding news conference 
zamora with a nod to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
sweeping reforms said a new openness had been attained at the 
summit a perestroika has begun he said 
extraordinary security precautions were taken to protect bush 
and his three summit partners with about 5000 uniformed troops 
watching over the proceedings battleships presented an imposing 
force off shore and helicopter gunships hovered nearby bush 
returned to washington late thursday without incident 
but colombian guerrillas made their own point one of defiance 
they kidnapped an american priest in cali the third us citizen 
taken prisoner by rebels this week also a small bomb exploded 
thursday morning 4 miles from barranquilla airport damaging a 
voltage regulator of a line that fed the air conditioning of the 
airport where bush landed two hours later 
at the summit bush met a key latin american demand by promising 
in the communique to fight cocaine consumption in his country 
i owe it to the children of america the united states to 
these three presidents to guarantee them that we will do everything 
we can to cut demand for narcotics in the united states bush 
said 
the four nations also promised to hold a followup meeting 
within six months to review progress in the batttle against cocaine 
and called for a 1991 world conference to address illegal drug 
trafficking 
the document proposed broadbased rural development to help 
prevent the economic hardship that it admitted will inevitably 
result from programs to substitute other crops for coca 
the communique indicated that the united states was willing to 
help finance programs to replenish the countrys foreign exchange 
and to help create jobs for farmers no longer able to grow the 
illegal crop 
the great result of the antidrug summit for our countries is 
the realization of the necessity of substituting a legal economy 
for the current coca economy zamora said 
in bolivias central chapare region an estimated 300000 
peasants make a living by growing the bush 
garcia has said repeatedly that many of the estimated 200000 
peruvian peasants who survive by growing coca could be driven into 
the camp of leftist rebels if their livelihood is taken away from 
them 
colombia has frequently complained that while it is spilling its 
blood fighting drug traffickers the us is discriminating against 
its legal exports such as coffee and flowers with high tariffs and 
other protective measures 
bush on thursday tried to address those complaints by saying he 
would work to open us markets more 
bush did not promise any more aid to the latin american 
countries other than the 22 billion over the next five years he 
had already pledged 
however the president perhaps realizing the programs called 
for in the communique would require additional funding said he 
would try to get western european and other developed nations to 
help foot the bill 
he added that at the economic summit of developed nations july 
911 in houston he would try to place economic assistance for latin 
american drug producers high on the agenda

the earthquake that walloped northern 
california in october triggered a fourfoothigh tsunami a huge 
undersea landslide and a feeding frenzy by fish in monterey bay 
scientists say 
towns along the bay were lucky the the tsunami or quakecaused 
sea wave occurred near low tide because if the jolt had come at 
high tide there could have been problems oceanographer frank 
schwing said thursday in a telephone interview 
the tsunami which measured as much as four feet from crest to 
trough moved through the bay at 67 mph just after the quake struck 
oct 17 said schwing of the national marine fisheries service in 
monterey 
submarine landslides including one twobyfivemiles in size 
suddenly exposed buried worms tiny crustaceans and other 
creatures attracting flatfish rockfish and deepsea perch he 
said 
a small unmanned submarine placed in the bay two weeks after the 
quake found the fish appeared to be engaging in a feeding 
frenzy on the newly exposed organisms schwing and others 
wrote in a study published in the current issue of eos an american 
geophysical union publication 
the 71 magnitude earthquake was centered on the san andreas 
fault about 10 miles northeast of santa cruz on the north side of 
monterey bay which is about 70 miles south of san francisco 
the us geological survey said the quake killed 62 people 
injured 3757 left 12053 homeless and caused more than 6 billion 
in damage in the greater san francisco bay region other estimates 
reported greater damage 
tsunamis which are often incorrectly called tidal waves are 
sudden rises and drops in sea level that sometimes make giant waves 
crash onto a coastline 
as the earthquake was unleashed the sea level in santa cruz 
harbor dropped about three feet as water rushed out of the harbor 
probably because the tremor lifted underlying ground upward by 
about four to eight inches schwing said 
people standing there actually saw the water go out he 
said there was some evidence boats actually hit bottom 
after the sea levels dropped they rose again by about three to 
four feet schwing said sea levels at monterey on the bays south 
side dropped about one foot then rose by 15 feet he said 
the tsunami took about 20 minutes to travel the approximate 24 
miles from santa cruz to monterey he said 
water sloshed back and forth across the bay every half hour for 
24 hours after the jolt rising and falling about one foot he 
added 
its analogous to having a tub of water and if you strike the 
side of the tub the water is going to bounce back and forth 
schwing said 
he said the tsunami and sloshing were much smaller than the 
normal tidal variation in monterey bay but the tsunami could have 
caused damage if it had happened at high tide 
ground failure or liquefaction on the bay floor caused 
numerous underwater landslides including the twobyfivemile 
slide about 15 miles west of moss landing the ground slid into 
monterey submarine canyon an underwater canyon about as deep and 
wide as the grand canyon schwing said 
schwing coauthored the study with jerry norton also at the 
national marine fisheries service and cindy pilskaln of the 
monterey bay aquarium research institute in pacific grove

worried that his constituents might lick 
or kiss a south american toad to get at the hallucinogenic toxin it 
secretes a legislator has introduced a bill making it illegal to 
get high on cane toads 
its the latest wave in hallucinating said rep pat harris 
citing the drug enforcement administrations recent toadlicking 
alert 
harris said thursday he has not heard of instances of cane 
toadlicking in south carolina although he said it was potentially 
an explosive phenomenon crack could pale in significance he 
joked 
they say these frogs grow to the size of a dinner plate i 
dont want to see somebody walk across the statehouse grounds with 
a frog on a leash and pick him up and lick him 
harris admitted his bill was good for nothing more than a laugh 
its a kind of tongueincheek deal the 78yearold real 
estate executive said kind of tongueonthefrog deal 
cane toads endemic to south america produce a toxin called 
bufotenine to ward off predators when licked raw or cooked the 
toxin acts as a hallucinogen 
asked if he would consider kissing a cane toad to hallucinate 
harris replied oh no no no id rather drink a lot of liquor

the tiny aluminum pincers invented by officer robert mika can be 
squeezed against an earlobe or finger especially the pinky to 
inflict pain without causing permanent injury 
dubbed the mika comealong the badged creator sees it as a 
public relationsconscious alternative to clubs stun guns and 
martial arts weapons 
the pincers can be held discreetly in the palm of the hand they 
are being evaluated for use by the police department officials 
said 
image is important in police work said mika a 16year 
department veteran 
you dont want something that looks too militaristic or has 
high visibility he said you dont want something that gives 
the image of overkill 
the pincers are the latest gadget mika has produced in the 
workshop at his suburban woodland hills home 
about 6000 officers have a mika pocket holster which 
prevents guns from snagging on pants pockets when drawn about 
3000 have ordered the mika pocket mirror which has a foldout 
handle that can be used to peek around street and corridor corners

researchers report today they have succeeded 
in giving a form of human leukemia to laboratory mice producing an 
animal that now can be used to test therapies against the disease 
with this new animal model experimental therapies that might 
otherwise be tried in human patients can now be tested in these 
mice said george daley lead researcher in the study conducted 
at the whitehead institute for biomedical research in cambridge 
mass 
you obviously can do more with the mice than you could with 
human patients he said 
the study published today in science says the whitehead 
researchers used intricate genetic engineering to inject into the 
bone marrow of laboratory mice the human gene linked to chronic 
myelogenous leukemia cml a form of a blood cancer that usually 
attacks adults and is only rarely cured 
daley said the study also proves cml is initiated by the fusion 
of parts from two broken chromosomes a finding that was suggested 
by earlier studies in other laboratories those parts have been 
identified as the socalled abl gene from chromosome 9 and a gene 
called bcr from chromosome 22 
cells containing this hybrid gene produce a protein called 
p210 that changes healthy cells into cancer cells 
daley said his study showed that transferring the bcrabl gene 
into mouse bone marrow and then putting these infected cells into 
healthy mice could produce cml in those mice 
it answers a question of basic science that is what causes 
the disease said daley we now know that the bcrabl gene is 
sufficient to induce the leukemia 
he said it is still not known precisely what causes the two 
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene but a high 
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor 
dr george canellos chief of medical oncology at the 
danafarber institute in boston said the whitehead finding is an 
important advance in understanding the disease 
he said the new animal model of the disease may help scientists 
find ways to block the action of the p210 protein produced by the 
bcrabl gene thus preventing the disease 
in screening biological substances it will make a very nice 
model said canellos 
daley said the mouse can be used to test biological 
inhibitors that would prevent the p210 protein from transforming 
normal cells into cancers such inhibitors formally could only be 
tested on human patients a process that could take years with a 
mouse model of the disease experiments can be sped up and can be 
more extensive 
to create the mouse model daley said he and his colleagues 
inserted the human bcrabl gene into a virus normal mouse bone 
marrow cells were then exposed to the virus which transferred the 
gene into the marrow cells 
thirty healthy mice were then irradiated to kill their bone 
marrow cells next the bone marrow carrying the bcrabl gene was 
transplanted into the 30 mice 
within five months 13 of the 30 mice developed a blood disease 
that mimicked human chronic myelogenous leukemia 
cml in humans can be controlled by chemotherapy for 3 to 5 
years this remission period usually ends with the sudden increase 
in abnormal cells a disease phase called blast crisis that 
usually results in death the only successful therapy used now is 
to kill the diseased bone marrow in the patient and replace it with 
healthy bone marrow from a compatible donor but even this 
treatment often fails 
daley said that continued studies of the cml mice show that many 
of the laboratory animals develop the blast crisis phase of the 
disease this he said is further verification that the course of 
the disease in the mice mimics cml in humans 
richard a van etten and david baltimore both of the whitehead 
institute were coauthors of the study with daley science which 
published the study is the journal of the american association for 
the advancement of science

even the best advances in the laboratory wont 
stem the aids epidemic unless people infected with the hiv virus 
change their sexual behavior researchers told a federal commission 
on the disease 
behavior is always the problem said dr john w ward of the 
national centers for disease control in atlanta look at smoking 
people still smoke in spite of peer pressure and such it always 
comes down to the individual to what benefit there is to the 
individual to change the behavior 
on thursday ward and other aids experts in academia government 
and medicine addressed a working group of the national commission 
on aids a panel appointed by president bush and congress to make 
national policy recommendations 
the group was meeting for a twoday conference focusing on 
testing for hiv the virus that causes aids and early 
intervention the group is to present its findings to the full 
commission next month in washington dc 
paul cleary a harvard associate professor of health care said 
aids testing may improve steadily and at first may seem to be a way 
to address the epidemic because it identifies the afflicted 
but the emotional costs to those who test positive for hiv and 
the social costs of some forms of testing make testing a policy the 
nation should approach cautiously cleary said 
counseling which can help people absorb the implications of 
their hiv infection and take steps to stop its spread is too often 
excluded altogether from aids testing speakers at the conference 
agreed 
panel members said patients react in dramatic and often tragic 
ways when they learn their blood contains the hiv virus they spoke 
of patients who refused to change their behavior or tell their 
sexual partners and of others who killed themselves 
others suppress the news cleary said 
we all work with persons with whom the information is not 
used he said 
adequate counseling can inform people who test positive of the 
possibility of false results tell them of the treatments available 
that often delay the onset of complications and help them 
understand the potential consequences of their infection the 
speakers said 
in addition however support services can help patients take 
steps to alter the behavior that may have got them the infection 
to ensure that its spread ends there 
the first step is giving people information saying if you 
care about people about the people you love your family you 
dont want to spread the deadly infection to them said ward the 
special assistant for science in the deputy directors office at 
the cdc 
about 1 million americans are believed to be infected with the 
hiv virus said dr alan r hinman of the cdc about 200000 of 
those have been tested and are aware of their infection he said

the authors of a study published today say 
california is succeeding in eliminating racial bias in the 
sentencing of felons to prison 
joan petersilia a rand corp researcher who cowrote the report 
appearing today in the journal science said it shows race plays no 
role in determining how long a convicted felon goes to prison in 
california 
she said the study shows californias determinate sentencing act 
almost means sentencing by computer 
various factors such as the type and seriousness of the crime 
and the defendants prior record are used to determine a 
sentencing score she said 
if you get a certain score then you go to prison unless the 
judge can give a very good explanation of why you will be an 
exception she said 
this has worked to the advantage of racial minorities ms 
petersilia said the system just doesnt have the discretion that 
it once had and as the discretion went away so did the opportunity 
for racial prejudice in the sentencing decision 
ms petersilia wrote a 1983 study that found racial bias in the 
california sentencing system but she says now that conclusion was 
in error she said judges told her the earlier study was flawed 
because it didnt take into account all the factors judges must 
consider in sentencing decisions 
she said the earlier study looked at 15 factors affecting the 
sentence but the new report was the result of studying 60 factors 
when those 60 factors were studied the addition of the 
individuals race made no difference she said 
factors considered included such things as whether a weapon was 
used how badly the victim was hurt whether an accomplice was 
involved and the precise role of the offender in the crime 
ms petersilia said the new study analyzed the records of 11553 
california offenders who were convicted in 1980 of assault 
robbery burglary theft forgery or drug crimes probation usually 
is not a possibility in more serious crimes such as murder so 
that type of offense was not analyzed she said 
the racial distribution in californias prisons is significantly 
out of balance when compared to the general population but the 
researcher said the criminal justice system is not to blame 
blacks make up about 34 percent of the california prison 
population and about 7 percent of the general population in the 
state hispanics are 19 percent of the state population and are 23 
percent of the prison population whites are 74 percent of the 
general population and 33 percent of those in prison 
what this study shows is that it is not a racist criminal 
justice system said ms petersilia she said the solution to the 
racial imbalance in the prisons must be found in the communities 
coauthors of the study with ms petersilia were stephen klein 
and susan turner all are researchers in the criminal justice 
program of the rand corporation a santa monica calif firm 
science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

soviet troops will begin leaving 
czechoslovakia in 10 days and an agreement on complete withdrawal 
from hungary may come within a month officials say 
soviet soldiers arrived in hungary to suppress the 1956 
antistalinist uprising and in czechoslovakia to crush the prague 
spring political liberalization of 1968 
with the first free general elections in more than 40 years 
nearing hungary and czechoslovakia are on the threshold of full 
democracy and see removal of soviet forces as a symbolic 
affirmation of independence 
gen anton slimak czechoslovak chief of staff said thursday 
the soviet withdrawal would begin next week in bruntal 160 miles 
east of prague the official news agency ctk reported 
later however ctk said soviet and czechoslovak delegations 
meeting in prague agreed the withdrawal would begin feb 26 the 
day president vaclav havel starts his first visit to moscow 
czechoslovakia had sought withdrawal of all 73500 red army 
troops by the end of this year but slimak said that would not 
happen moscow wants to have until the end of 1991 and sources in 
prague said earlier this week that june 1991 was a likely 
compromise 
no final date was agreed at thursdays talks in prague but 
talks will continue to nail that down ctk said 
in budapest a senior hungarian official was quoted thursday as 
predicting agreement within a month on ending decades of soviet 
military presence 
magyar nemzet a hungarian daily quoted foreign ministry 
official ferenc somogyi as saying hungary could count on working 
out the agreement within a month 
czechoslovakia has insisted the soviets withdraw whatever the 
results of eastwest talks in vienna on reducing conventional 
forces in europe but hungary has not 
officials on both sides appear confident of conventional forces 
agreement this year now that the soviets have accepted president 
bushs proposal to reduce the number of us and soviet soldiers in 
central europe to 195000 for each side 
hungary wants all 50000 soviet soldiers off its territory by 
early 1991 but somogyi said compromise was possible because of 
kremlin concerns about transportation and providing facilities for 
the returning soldiers 
we have to take into account our negotiating partners 
position he was quoted as saying 
slimak said withdrawal from czechoslovakia could not be 
completed by the end of 1990 for technical and social reasons 
a preliminary agreement indicates about 35 percent of the 
soldiers will be withdrawn by the end of may along with 40 percent 
of the tanks 30 percent of other combat vehicles and nearly one 
third of helicopters and artillery slimak said 
czechoslovakia has asked that a substantial part of the soviet 
forces be out before elections scheduled for june

the top aide to charles h keating jr says 
government regulators were responsible for keatings lincoln 
savings and loan co losing a 9 million profit from a stock deal 
government lawyers attacked the claims thursday saying keating 
never meant for lincoln to reap all the profits from the 
transaction a centerpiece of the allegation that keating illegally 
used the 55 billion thrifts federally insured deposits to make 
risky investments in junk bonds and finance his arizona real estate 
empire 
regulators say taxpayers could have to pay up to 2 billion to 
cover lincolns losses making it the costliest of more than 500 
thrift failures the past two years 
the transaction which involved memorex stock came in the week 
after the oct 19 1987 black monday stock market crash 
in the 12th day of a hearing on keatings lawsuit to undo the 
federal takeover of lincoln in april his top aide testified 
lincoln could not have bought back 79275 shares of memorex it sold 
four months earlier without violating a promise to regulators to 
buy no more stock 
judith wischer president of lincolns holding company american 
continental corp said the pledge was made at an oct 21 1987 
meeting with regulators 
because of that wischer told us district court judge stanley 
sporkin she and other top executives of lincoln and american 
continental decided oct 23 to have the parent company buy the 
stock rather than have lincoln repurchase it from tucson 
stockbroker and developer ernest c garcia 
regulators in the treasury departments office of thrift 
supervision and former federal home loan bank board have denied any 
such pledge was made at the oct 21 meeting 
government lawyers thursday presented a deed of transfer of the 
memorex stock from garcia to american continental signed by 
lincolns president bruce dickson and dated oct 21 two days 
before mrs wischer said the decision was made 
the date is not the correct date mrs wischer said i 
dont know why the dates differ the transaction was agreed to late 
friday night or monday morning oct 23 or oct 26 
dickson who also was a senior vice president of american 
continental has refused to testify on keatings suit claiming a 
fifth amendment constitutional protection against 
selfincrimination 
a federal grand jury in los angeles is considering possible 
criminal charges against officials of lincoln and american 
continental 
government attorneys contend the oct 21 deed is evidence that 
keating never intended for lincoln to take all the profits from the 
memorex stock and that the purchase through american continental 
was an illegal usurpation of corporate opportunity 
they also cited lincolns purchases of 19 million in stock in 
november and another 17 million in december as evidence that 
lincoln was continuing to invest in equities despite claims by its 
officials they had promised regulators they would not 
lincoln acquired the memorex stock for 1 a share in december 
1986 as a sweetener to its purchase of 40 million in junk 
bonds yielding 14 percent interest that were financing british 
investor james goldsmiths takeover move on the dutch computer 
company 
the bonds were sold the following april and may at a 15 
million profit to lincoln the thrift then sought from regulators 
but was effectively denied permission to sell the stock for 28 
million to american continental 
in june 1987 lincoln sold the stock to garcia for 1 million 
about 1250 a share with an option to buy it back for 425 
million or about 5350 per share

doris hagbergs mother spoke to her 
this week more than 20 years after her death 
the voice came through scratchy but excited on a record made in 
1937 atop the empire state building that mrs hagber set aside 
until she found a special wooden needle to play the souvenir 
all these years ive been thinking about it she said before 
she found a windup victrola and wooden needle 
every now and then mrs hagberg who is 68 would look at the 
record and wonder what message her mother had recorded during that 
new york vacation the hitch was the needle an inchlong clampin 
stylus 
she searched record stores and antique shops around her home in 
port angeles a city of 17000 across from victoria canada on the 
juan de fuca strait 
she wrote letters to stores in seattle and traveled across the 
puget sound to rummage through record collections and thrift shops 
in that city she even asked relatives to search in los angeles 
nowhere could she find the right needle 
she looked again at the envelope her mother used to mail the 
fiveinch silver disc 
it said empire state observatory and that was the only 
place i could think of to try that i hadnt 
she wrote a letter in january adressed to whoever at the 
building asking for help 
observatory director laura fries forwarded mrs hagbergs letter 
to the new york times and it appeared in that papers 
metropolitan diary column 
ms fries reported getting more than 50 calls offering needles 
or suggesting alternatives such as toothpicks rose thorns and 
cactus spines 
she sent a couple of needles by federal express and mrs 
hagberg arranged with the clallam county museum in port angeles to 
use their 1918vintage victrola to play the record 
on valentines day the late ella goller spoke to her daughter 
once more 
on hand were former museum director virginia fitzpatrick and bob 
blake a recording studio technician who brought a portable 
fourtrack recorder to capture the records sound in case it was 
damaged in the playing 
blake set his recording levels mrs fitzpatrick clamped the 
needle in place cranked the metal arm at the side of the fourfoot 
phonograph cabinet and set wood to groove 
mrs hagberg leaned close from her seat beside the cabinet and 
listened out came a scratchy barely audible female voice none of 
those present could make the message out 
mrs fitzpatrick tried another needle and the voice came out 
again not much louder but clear enough to make out this 
having a grand time 
mrs hagberg repeated the words 
the record was played again and the words theres so much to 
do could be heard 
the voice on the record giggled and mrs hagbergs eyes 
brightened with a memory of the time her mother left for a 
monthlong new york trip in 1937 leaving her then 16 with her 
father 
i remember my dad making chow mein with venison and burning 
it when she was gone the night she went i was babysitting and i 
locked myself out of the house she smiled 
not much else could be gathered from the record but blakes 
recorder cleared up some of the crackling 
one could spend the entire day here theres so much to see 
mrs goller said on blakes enhanced recording the buildings 
look just like towers down in the street

one of changlin tiens earliest memories 
of america is a segregated drinking fountain he saw in kentucky 
that memory could be a portent of what awaits tien as chancellor 
of the university of californiaberkeley which has been wracked by 
controversies over minority admissions and faculty hiring 
at a news conference thursday to announce his selection as

ancestry to head a major us university 
rep norm mineta dsan jose a japaneseamerican praised 
tiens selection 
for americans of asian ancestry in particular dr tiens 
appointment represents a milestone not only because he is the first 
asian american to head a uc campus but also because of the campus

tien an internationally recognized authority in heat transfer 
technology stayed at berkeley for 29 years before becoming 
executive vice chancellor at ucirvine 18 months ago at berkeley 
he served three years as vice chancellor of research and seven 
years as chairman of the mechanical engineering department 
his list of high honors is long a member of the national 
academy of engineers his fields most prestigious professional

of strength to demand new elections police said today that up to

whites by granting people with revolutionary aims and who want 
to enslave others by means of violence freedom of movement and the 
right to organize 
its an injustice against the nation

legitimate targets and will continue attacking them until south 
africas white leaders negotiate an agreement on racial equality

federal health officials are at a loss to explain 
why about 6 million americans who complain of arthritis will not 
see a doctor about it 
the national centers for disease control said thursday in a new 
survey that 35 million americans or 146 percent of the 
population reported having arthritis but only about 29 million 
had consulted a doctor 
these findings indicate the need to determine why these 
persons have not sought medical care and to identify approaches 
for overcoming barriers to care the cdc said in its weekly 
report 
dr arthur grazel senior vice president for medical affairs at 
the arthritis foundation said the report confirms our suspicions 
that many people think they can treat arthritis themselves 
prolonged arthritis without medical care can lead to irreversible 
joint damage grazel said 
foundation spokesman steve erickson said there is a real big 
misconception that only overthecounter pain medication is 
useful in treating the ailment 
the warning signs of arthritis include joint swelling early 
morning stiffness recurring joint pain or inability to move a 
joint that lasts for more than two weeks he said 
the survey of 3000 people taken in 1987 found higher rates of 
arthritis in women than men with the rate of incidence increasing 
with age for people over the age of 75 the rate was 53 percent 
the report also said that overall 3 percent reported arthritis 
was limiting their activities race had no statistical relevance as 
a factor in people reporting arthritis the rates were 15 percent 
for whites and 14 percent for blacks

the countrys first popularly elected 
prime minister is battling political infighting corruption and 
possibly meddling by the military that could bring down his 
government 
in this land where military coups were once as dependable as the 
monsoon rains prime minister chatichai choonhavans chief rival is 
an officer who insists democracy is here to stay 
one scandal after another has hit his coalition government he 
has muddled through so far but he is no james bond a leading 
newspaper editor suthichai yoon wrote recently of chatichai 
while not quite in the league of the indestructible fictional 
spy chatichais image of a partyloving and energetic leader 
initially spurred his popularity he also earned the nickname of 
mr no problem for insisting that his immediate political 
problems and the deeper ones afflicting thailand could easily be 
handled 
but problems are now piling up for this longtime prowestern 
country and for chatichais 18monthold government 
last month bangkoks vital river port was closed down by a 
fourday strike amid allegations of military involvement 
in addition police allegations have linked a senator and former 
economic adviser to chatichai kitti damnernchanvanich to 
largescale illegal logging in thailands ravaged forests 
these and other problems are being vigorously exploited if not 
partially orchestrated by political opponents 
they have also created splits both within the sixparty 
governing coalition and chatichais own chart thai party 
local editors and other anlaysts have talked of a possible 
cabinet change others have predicted dissolution of parliament 
when it reconvenes in may followed by elections that could oust 
68yearold chatichai before his term expires in 1992 
the army commander gen chavalit yongchaiyudh is widely seen 
as a rival or successor to chatichai 
the general has indicated he will retire from the military in 
april and enter civilian politics 
chavalit personally intervened to settle the port strike 
leading to speculation the military had orchestrated the whole 
thing to enhance its image 
this was a tactic frequently used in past decades when coups by 
military strongmen determined who ruled thailand but chavalit 
denied involvement in the strike and has frequently stated that the 
days of coupmaking are over 
chavalits accession to power through democratic means or 
otherwise would probably have little effect on thailands general 
course in recent years one ruling clique has replaced the next 
while the country itself has remained prowestern capitalist and 
respectful of the constitutional monarchy 
corruption has remained entrenched in the system but some 
academics political opposition figures and other critics claim the 
chatichai government has sunk to a new low 
allegedly cronyism has been a prominent feature of the 
present system indeed one is reminded of the marcos regime 
wrote political scientist likhit dhiravegin recently referring to 
the toppled philippine government of the late ferdinand marcos 
it is estimated that 10 to 15 businesss groups rallying around 
the power center have hastily taken the opportunity to exploit the 
gold mine

haitian community leaders dismissed 
as racist a new federal policy prohibiting haitians and subsaharan 
africans from donating blood because of the high incidence of aids 
in their home countries 
the policy announced this month by the food and drug 
administration requires blood collection agencies regulated by the 
fda to refuse blood from donors who were born in or emigrated from 
those countries 
the decision is based on the high incidence of africans and 
haitians infected with the aids virus through heterosexual contact 
which seems to play a major role in transmitting the virus 
according to the fda 
we still have the stigma then that we are carriers of aids 
said chantal thomas executive director of the haitian american 
community center in west palm beach it is insulting how dare 
they do something like that 
fda spokesman brad stone defended the rule 
we can understand how individuals from haiti would be upset by 
this policy in many cases they probably wont have it but right 
now this is the only fairly reliable method we have to protect the 
blood supply stone said 
most of the other groups in the united states considered to be 
high risk intravenous drug users homosexuals and prostitutes 
are discouraged from donating blood 
but it seems that in haiti and other countries the roots of 
transmission may be different stone said that makes it very 
hard at this point to set up criteria for self deferral 
we are not happy with this we understand the sensitivities 
nor is the policy an indictment of the haitian people or in any way 
a racial policy stone said 
joseph fanfan a fort lauderdale doctor with a family practice 
blasted the decision 
you cant just consider an ethnic group or nationality as 
being a risk group said fanfan former chairman of the haitian 
american community organization of broward county inc sexual 
promiscuity is being practiced by a lot of people and is not 
inherent in just one group of people 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a deadly disease caused 
by a virus carried in the blood it is spread through the use of 
infected hypodermic needles and sex 
for reasons that are not clear aids was first diagnosed in the 
united states mainly in the gay community and among haitian 
immigrants 
a previous fda policy permitted donations from haitians and 
subsaharan africans if they came to this country before 1977 
but the more we looked into aids we found that 1977 is a 
fairly good year to pinpoint its start in the united states but it 
may not be a good year to pinpoint in other parts of the world 
stone said

nearly half of working american adults do not 
believe social security will be able to pay them benefits when they 
retire a survey says 
the december survey of 1001 adults found that 49 percent of 
those who had not yet retired were confident social security would 
be able to pay them benefits 47 percent did not expect to get 
benefits and 4 percent were unsure 
the survey released thursday by the gallup organization was 
commissioned by the employee benefit research institute a 
nonprofit nonpartisan research group 
dallas salisbury the institutes president said the results 
indicate people are unrealistically pessimistic about the 
social security system and have not been well educated about how it 
works 
salisbury said confidence in social security could drop further 
as public debate continues on a proposal by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny to cut social security taxes to keep the 
government from using social security revenue for general 
government operations 
the debate is bringing into question the ability of the system 
to pay future benefits salisbury said 
president bush has criticized the moynihan proposal and claims 
that it could jeopardize benefits for future retirees 
the survey found that confidence in social security benefits was 
highest among those closest to retirement with 76 percent of those 
aged 55 and older expecting to receive benefits compared with 46 
percent of those aged 1834

federal officials say more than 3000 bottles 
of an antibiotic distributed by goldline laboratories doxycycline 
hyclate are being recalled because one bottle was found to contain 
a muscle relaxant 
doxycycline hyclate is used to treat a wide range of infections 
including venereal diseases acne and lifethreatening pneumonia

or operate heavy machinery 
the recalled bottles of goldline doxycycline hyclate 100 
milligrams are in six lots the bottles carry lot numbers 824039 
844059 863069 882079 883079 and 919099

a couple whose 17yearold daughter is dying 
of leukemia is having a baby in hopes the infant will prove to be a 
compatible bone marrow donor who can save their daughters life 
abe and mary ayala of suburban walnut undertook the desperate 
gamble against the advice of their doctor following a fruitless 
nationwide search for a suitable donor the los angeles times 
reported today 
it made me uncomfortable said dr patricia konrad a 
pediatric oncologist at city of hope medical center in duarte it 
didnt sit well if that was the only reason to have a child to 
help another child 
the odds are about one in four that the baby a girl who will 
be born in april will provide a compatible match doctors say 
i never thought id be pregnant at my age but when youre 
faced with the possibility that your child is going to die you 
desperately seek and whatever you need to do you do it said 
mary ayala 43 
konrad despite her misgivings has agreed to perform the marrow 
transplant if the baby turns out to have compatible tissue 
abe ayala had undergone a vasectomy after their daughter 
anissa was born doctors offered little hope a reversal would 
succeed but mrs ayala became pregnant six months after her 
husbands operation 
were just waiting and hoping that our miracle baby will be 
the miracle baby that anissa needs mrs ayala said 
anissas condition has stabilized and doctors have told the 
family that bone marrow can be obtained at little risk from an 
infant who is at least six months old 
if the tissue matches anissa will undergo a long and painful 
process of preparing for transplant surgery her existing bone 
marrow which is being ravaged by the malignancy would be 
destroyed through bombardments of radiation and chemotherapy 
donor marrow is harvested by inserting a thick needle repeatedly 
into the donors hipbones a healthy donor can regenerate lost 
marrow within a week 
medical ethicists said it is extremely rare for a baby to be 
conceived specifically to serve as a bone marrow donor for an 
ailing family member 
medical procedures such as donating marrow during transplant 
surgery require a patients informed consent with children such 
consent usually is given by the parents or legal guardian 
the ayala case however raises questions about the parents 
objectivity in deciding what is in the newborns best interest 
how much potential pain and risk can one parent demand of one 
sibling for the benefit of another siblingasked jake priester a 
research fellow at the center for biomedical ethics at the 
university of minnesota 
the ayalas voiced dismay that their motives might be questioned 
if its not a match we will love our baby just the same 
mary ayala said 
the couple discussed the idea at length with anissa and their 
19yearold son airon and they sought guidance from god mrs 
ayala said 
i had a dream and god told me everything was going to be ok 
she said he wants me to have this baby

and four other people were charged with running an illegal lottery 
out of an historic city church 
police on thursday raided the ebenezer ame church and 13 
homes allegedly used as substations for the bookmaking operation 
the arrests were partly a result of wiretaps placed on the 
pastors phone after police were tipped off by members of the 
congregation who were offended by what was going on said sgt 
george klein of the vice unit 
we were pretty skeptical about it at first said klein we 
thought no one in their right mind would run a lottery out of a 
church 
the rev wendall christopher 39 was charged with allowing the 
church to be used for an illegal lottery police said assistant 
pastor jerome berry 58 and his wife mary berry 49 were charged

directly participated in the operation but allowed it to operate 
from his study in exchange for a portion of the proceeds 
also detained were church secretary julie hall 36 rebecca 
griffin 57 phyllis cooper 28 and larry cooper 42 police said 
ebenezer is believed to be the oldest continuously used black 
church in the city the site of the church was purchased by freed 
slaves in 1839 and the present structure was built in the 1860s 
police were tipped off about the alleged lottery in may and in 
october obtained a court order to tap the pastors telephone they 
said 
three and fourdigit numbers were collected from players each 
day at the substations and phoned to the church police said the 
operation used the winning maryland state lottery numbers to 
determine its winners 
police said they would not have an idea of the amount of money 
involved in the operation until they look at seized lottery slips

prime minister bob hawke today called a 
general election for march 24 in a bid to gain a record fourth 
consecutive term for his labor government 
hawke said australians faced clear and stark alternatives in 
a vote over his governments economic record 
we can as a nation make the choice to continue on the path of 
steady growth or under the conservatives we can choose to forsake 
the future in a traumatic rerun of the late 70s and early 80s he 
said referring to years when the opposition was in power 
the central question is whether we will continue forward 
toward a fair society an increasingly efficient australian 
economy he said 
hawke spoke at a news conference after meeting with 
governorgeneral bill hayden to get approval for the election date 
the timing of the election comes amid widespread dissatisfaction 
with 17 percent interest rates which have hurt home buyers and 
small businesses but the opposition coalition also has suffered 
from internal squabbling and difficulty outlining alternative 
policies 
hawke 60 said he expected to lead the labor party to an 
unprecedented fifth term before retiring 
andrew peacock the 51yearold opposition coalition leader 
also predicted victory 
it is good news for all australians he said of the election 
date this has been a government which has put average 
australians last it has been a government for the very few and 
privileged 
the labor party under hawke was first elected in march 1983 and 
won in early elections in 1984 and 1987 the deadline for calling 
the next elections was may 12 with a threeyear term of government 
hawke is considered one of the most popular leaders ever in 
australia despite his tearful confessions about infidelity many 
years ago his daughters former heroin addiction and his 
acknowledgment that he once had a drinking problem 
recent opinion polls show support for the labor party at 45 
percent compared with 42 percent for the conservative 
liberalnational party coalition 
labor has 85 seats in the 148seat house of representatives 
which chooses the government the liberal party has 45 seats and 
its coalition partner national party has 18 seats 
hawke is hoping voters will remember the governments record of 
creating jobs while lowering personal and corporate taxes the

the us air force colonel in charge of the pacific 
stars and stripes resigned today saying the pentagon ombudsman had 
criticized him for managing the news published in the paper serving 
us troops overseas 
i believe it was appropriate for the good of the organization 
to tender my resignation col edwin j montgomery said 
he said ombudsman philip foisie whom the defense department 
named last year had said in a report that i inserted myself into 
the newspapers editorial process unnecessarily especially in 
the early part of his nearly fouryear tenure 
montgomery declined to give more details on the ombudsmans 
judgment but said he was pleased that foisie had not accused him 
of censorship 
i am disappointed that he saw my efforts to fulfill the 
charter as management of the news the air force officer said in 
a telephone interview 
the mission i had was to publish a newspaper that was unafraid 
of news critical to its readers and their profession but accurate 
in good taste and which assured that both sides of contentious 
issues were aired ive done my level best to accomplish that 
foisies report was not made public and when the associated 
press reached him at us army headquarters in heidelberg west 
germany he declined to comment on montgomerys resignation 
foisie was visiting the european stars and stripes the sister 
paper of the tokyobased publication read by some 135000 us 
troops in the pacific region 
since his appointment foisie has visited both stars and stripes 
papers to interview their military and civilian staff members to 
assess the free flow of information to the papers military 
readership 
foisie is a former foreign editor of the washington post and 
former executive editor of the parisbased international herald 
tribune 
civilian journalists at the pacific stars and stripes have 
complained of censorship by military editors news management and 
harassment of journalists who raise objections 
one senior civilian journalist in tokyo dewey brackett has 
testified to congress about his complaints and believes he was 
removed from the post of pacific editor as a result 
montgomery who has denied censoring the paper is retiring from 
the military later this year and his replacement has already been 
named marine col walter s de forest he like montgomery is to 
hold the titles of commander and editor in chief of the paper 
though the ombudsman has recommended that a civilian be the editor 
while the commanding military officer hold the title of publisher 
foisie said in an interim report that having a civilian be the 
top news executive would make the paper less vulnerable to charges 
that the military censors it 
the stars and stripes papers are authorized but unofficial 
publications the pentagon says their charter says they are to 
provide a free flow of news and information without 
censorship or news management

an undercover detective who worked on 
highlevel drug trafficking cases was killed by a bomb planted in 
his unmarked police car authorities said 
dennis wustenhoff 41 died at stony brook university medical 
center on thursday after his car blew up in front of his home in in 
this long island city said hospital spokeswoman maxine simpson 
this was probably an assassination and jobconnected said 
suffolk county police commissioner daniel guido but we dont 
know whether it was revenge or related to a current case wustenhoff 
was working on 
wustenhoff a 20year veteran was assigned to the narcotics 
squad in 1984 he was involved in major highlevel 
narcoticstrafficking investigations said cecilia clausing a 
suffolk county police spokeswoman 
the bomb blew out the entire front part of the latemodel white 
cadillac throwing debris up to 200 feet guido said there were no 
other injuries 
the device was placed either in the engine or under the drivers 
seat guido said it was unclear if it exploded when the officer 
turned on the ignition switch or whether it was set off when he sat 
in the drivers seat 
a neighbor who heard the explosion came running and helped pull 
him out of the car 
according to guido the officer was conscious and made some 
comments to the rescuer when asked if he knew who might have done 
it 
guido would not reveal what the comments were but he said the 
killing was not a street level operation it was much higher than 
that 
wustenhoff was decorated 10 times by the department and had 
worked with federal drug enforcement administration agents on a 
number of projects 
the presiding officer of the suffolk county legislature donald 
blydenburgh announced that a 1000 reward is being offered for 
information about the blast that leads to arrests 
wustenhoff leaves a wife and three children a 14yearold boy 
and two girls aged 12 and 10 his wife and children were not in the 
house at the time of the blast

us secretary of 
defense dick cheney peered through binoculars into heavily 
fortified north korea today and said the experience reminded him of 
americas determination to protect freedom and democracy around 
the world 
at a time when we are welcoming changes in eastern europe and 
the erosion of the soviet position in the warsaw pact its 
important to be reminded that the united states and the republic of 
south korea still face a very hostile and threatening power in 
the north said cheney 
cheney was driven up steep muddy slopes by jeep to this 
mountaintop south korean army observation post along the 25 
mileswide demilitarized zone which separates the communist north 
from capitalist south korea 
the border between the two koreas is one of the most heavily 
armed in the world with some 15 million troops behind barbed wire 
and bunkers on both sides 
south korean lt col chang gwangil told cheney in a strategic 
briefing that gongjak overlooked the chorwon valley one of the 
main invasion routes used by the communist north at the start of 
the 195053 korean war a peace treaty has never been signed and 
the two nations remain technically at war 
col chang told cheney he was visiting the site on the birthday 
of north koreas kim jong il the son and heir apparent of ruler 
kim il sung the worlds longest ruling communist dictator 
we never forget that we fought here side by side were 
ready to fight said the young south korean colonel 
cheney was flown to the border outpost by helicopter after 
lunching with troops of the us 2nd infantry division but had to 
cancel a scheduled visit to panmunjom the truce village on the 
border of the two koreas due to dense fog 
during his visit to camp casey headquarters of the us 2nd 
infantry division located 35 miles northeast of seoul he passed 
dozens of tanks bunkers and guard posts covered with camouflage 
buildings painted in speckled olive and brown and soldiers in 
fulldress battle fatigues 
journalists were told cheney asked to have an informal lunch 
with 12 noncommissioned officers with no generals present the 
special fare for the day at camp caseys warriors club where 
cheney ate was a secretary of defense turkey club sandwich 
cheney explained the background of cuts in troop strength and 
defense spending to senior enlisted men and asked for their 
comments one witness said 
there are 43000 us troops stationed in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact us officials said thursday about 5000 are 
expected to be withdrawn in the next three years 
the secretary told seoul officials earlier that he wants to cut 
us forces in asia and the pacific by 10 to 12 percent at least 
12000 troops over the next three years 
he said about 5000 of the troops would be pulled out of south 
korea and another 7000 to 9400 would be withdrawn from the 
philippines and japan there are 120000 us troops based in the 
three countries 
cheney who also will travel to manila and tokyo said the troop 
cuts in south korea would not be pushed precipitously 
our commitment remains strong cheney told reporters 
thursday 
at a meeting with south korean president roh taewoo thursday 
cheney reaffirmed washingtons firm security commitment to seoul 
and warned the military threat from communist north korea remains 
undiminished 
the koreas divided since 1945 face each other with more than 
15 million troops deployed on both sides 
on thursday north korea charged that cheney was in the region 
to observe south korean preparations for war against the north 
in a radio broadcast monitored in tokyo north korea also 
demanded a halt to ussouth korea team spirit military 
exercises underway since last month calling them nuclear war 
preparations against the north 
at a news conference at the end of talks thursday south korean 
defense minister lee sanghoon said his government would give 
positive consideration to increasing its support for the us 
troops 
an american official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
cheney wants seoul to double its 300 million annual contribution 
to the support of american forces 
the official said many of the details will not be worked out 
until the fall 
south korean estimates it provides nearly 2 billion annually to 
us forces such as the rentfree use of land that is not counted 
in the american calculation

mayor richard m daley unveiled a 5 billion plan 
for a third chicago air terminal that would lower traffic and 
delays at the worlds busiest airport ohare international 
daley announced thursday that officials are planning a 
9400acre airport to be called lake calumet airport near indiana 
harbor on the citys southeast side 
daley said the airport would cost 49 billion and generate 
137 billion annually for the impoverished industrial area which 
he called an ideal place for the longdiscussed airport 
others werent so sure 
the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal proposal is the 
recognition by the city of the need for a third major airport for 
the region said rep henry hyde whose district encompasses 
ohare 
federal transportation officials attribute national travel 
delays to ohares overcrowind problems ohare is located 
northwest of downtown chicago and midway airport is in the 
southwest 
the location proposed by mayor daley seems woefully inadequate 
and the proposed completion date of 2010 means that buck rogers 
will make one of the first landings at the new facility said 
hyde a republican 
he said building an airport there would displace 3500 homes and 
suggested the mayor go back to the drawing board 
us transportation secretary samuel k skinner welcomed daleys 
announcement and said the site he mentioned should be considered 
along with others that have been suggested to the south of the city 
and in northwest indiana

britain and argentina renewed diplomatic ties 
severed nearly eight years ago over the falklands war but 
argentina said it would keep pressing its claim over the islands 
foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain praised the accord 
reached thursday in madrid spain after two days of talks 
it underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with argentina 
and this has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty 
he said on britains private sky television 
foreign minister domingo cavallo of argentina said thursdays 
accord means passing from a state of war to a state of peace 
in buenos aires president carlos menem said the accord opened 
up trade possibilities for argentina a major meat exporter it 
followed the resumption last month of direct air service between 
the two nations who traditionally were heavy trading partners 
menem also named deputy foreign minister mario campora nephew 
of former president hector campora as the ambassador to britain 
menem however repeated argentinas claim to sovereignty of the 
south atlantic islands 300 miles off his countrys southeastern 
coast he said its claim was not diminished by restoring diplomatic 
ties 
the falklands war broke out after argentine forces invaded the 
britishruled islands on april 2 1982 britain sent a military 
task force that recaptured them after a 74day war 
the fighting claimed the lives of 712 argentines 255 britons 
and three islanders 
britain began ruling the islands as a colony in 1833 after spain 
ceased to govern argentina and abandoned the archipelago 
argentina claims it inherited the islands under the name las 
malvinas from spain and says britain stole them 
british prime minister margaret thatcher has refused to discuss 
falklands sovereignty with argentina in turn argentina refused 
until thursday to declare the war officially over 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar applauded the 
accord saying it creates an atmosphere of confidence 
talks between british and argentine officials on resuming normal 
relations began in august after menem said argentina would not use 
them to raise its claim over the falklands 
a key to the madrid agreement was britains agreement to lift 
its 150mile military protection zone around the islands british 
submarines ships and planes have patrolled the zone 
the islands are guarded by about 2000 british troops 
the british foreign office said the two nations had agreed to 
inform each other about movements of their warships and military 
aircraft in key areas of the south atlantic and give notice of 
large military exercises 
under the arrangement argentine warships wishing to come within 
50 miles of the islands and argentine warplanes wishing to come 
within 70 miles must give 48 hours warning 
the foreign office said ambassadors will be exchanged in due 
course 
hurd said it is for the falkland islanders to decide on their 
own contacts with the mainland argentina 
most of the 1900 islanders are fiercely probritish their 
legislative council refused an invitation to join the madrid talks 
william fullerton governor of the islands told british 
televisions channel 4 news from stanley the capital they 
accept that there should be good relations between britain and 
argentina 
he added the thing they would be worried about is the 
sovereignty issue and all along that has been specifically 
excluded from the talks

prime minister yitzhak shamir gave his approval 
to building a voice of america transmitting station in israels 
negev desert despite protests from environmental advocates and air 
force officers 
the dispute over the us governmentfunded station has caused 
strains between israel and the bush administration at a time of 
delicate contacts between the two countries over complex middle 
east peace moves 
the station expects to start broadcasting from israel to africa 
india afghanistan soviet asia and eastern europe in 1993 its 
officials say 
environmental affairs minister roni milo of shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc has argued against the new transmitter saying it seems 
unnecessary in light of recent changes in eastern europe 
however malcolm forbes jr chairman of the board of 
international broadcasting said thursday the new station was 
needed to further promote democracy 
we agreed that in order to carry on the process of democracy 
we must continue to have the exchange and free flow of information 
to all parts of the world forbes told reporters thursday after a 
20minute meeting with shamir the board oversees the network 
the planned station is seen in washington as crucial to 
transmitting voa programs among millions in asia and africa where 
many governments have not undergone the recent liberalization in 
eastern europe and the soviet union 
we are moving ahead as decided two years ago shamir was very 
supportive forbes added referring to the agreement signed with 
israel in june 1987 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner said the premier told forbes 
that israel would honor its agreement to allow the station 
israeli newspapers said the premiers consent follows a decision 
by the four senior leaders of the coalition cabinet made up of 
likud and the centerleft labor party 
these top ministers stepped in after messages delivered through 
us ambassador william brown were quoted by reports as urging 
quick completion of the planning stages 
work on the station has been delayed by lobbying from israeli 
nature groups that claim the threesquaremile complex and 
200meter tall antennae would emit radiation and disrupt wildlife 
including a bird migration route to africa 
objections have also come from air force commander maj gen 
avihu bennun who fears an important bomber training field may 
have to be moved because the new station will interfere with its 
operation israeli media reported 
communications minister gad yaacobi of labor has backed the 
project claiming it could bring up to 1 billion to israels 
debtridden economy over the next 25 years and provide hundreds of 
jobs

homeless to promote affordable housing 
the first night i slept out it was rather warm but last 
night it began to snow a little after midnight and it was very 
very cold katie wales 22 a recent graduate of brown 
university said thursday 
it was a very frightening experience being that cold wales 
said 
the campouts which started sunday and were set to end today 
attracted about 80 people at locations in providence cranston and 
pawtucket nearly twice the original goal organizer jim tull said 
it was supposed to be only three at each spot but people have 
just been coming down and adding to the numbers including some 
homeless people said tull 35 a codirector of amos house a 
shelter and soup kitchen 
weve had families we had a woman with three of her children

the effort is part of a nationwide campaign that started dec 25 
and is scheduled to continue in 65 communities until april 15 tull 
said a similar vigil also was held in washington dc this week 
rhode islands homeless population could be from 2000 to 5000 
said tull nationally it is estimated there are between 3 million 
and 4 million homeless

when that starts banging on the box it keeps you awake the 
people who werent in a box they got soaking wet said ed a

lawmakers today demanded changes in a landmark 
bill legalizing private property after attacking the proposal as 
overly narrow vague and open to abuses 
a group of 100 deputies fearing quick changes in the soviet 
union today announced formation of a parliamentary faction to 
resist the breakup of the ussr members of the new group 
vowed to fight separatism nationalism and chauvinism 
in the second day of its winter session the supreme soviet 
parliament sent the bill to committee and said it would take up the 
issue next week 
the property bill stems from the communist partys decision last 
week to diverge from orthodox marxism and permit individual 
property including means of production 
but the 35article bill never uses the words private 
property outright instead it speaks of the property of 
citizens 
deputy vladimir tikhonov an agricultural scientist said he is 
concerned that it mentions the right to own property but does not 
require the often recalcitrant soviet bureaucracy to sell it 
other lawmakers speaking on the second day of debate over the 
proposal argued the bill is not clear 
everything in the draft law has two meanings said anatoly 
sobchak a prominent reformminded deputy from leningrad he said 
the law must specify that any form of property is legal 
mikhail s gorbachevs nearly fiveyear tenure as soviet leader 
has led to many upheavals in politics and society but few official 
proposals have the ideological sweep of the proposed property law 
citizens who were taught for generations that property is theft 
are now being asked to accept private ownership along with two 
other forms of property already in existence collective and state 
ownership 
the words private property cause an allergy in us all 
said one lawmaker who spoke in support of the bill 
for decades soviet orthodoxy has forbidden the private 
ownership of farms factories or equipment on a large scale 
viewing it as the root of economic exploitation 
but the proposed law has the blanket legalization of the means 
of production and says foreign firms once scorned as agents of 
imperialism or neocolonialism can own factories and buildings 
the law is designed to spur the stagnating economy through 
greater productivity and an inflow of western capital 
if we want to have a market economy and take part in the 
international marketplace then we need such a law justice 
minister veniamin f yakovlev said in defense of the bill thursday 
the new parliamentary faction soyuz russian for union 
appears to be opposing baltic representatives who want to restore 
independence to their republics it also seems to oppose the 
interregional group an organization of progressive radicals 
demanding rapid radical economic and political reform 
the interregional group includes leading reformer boris n 
yeltsin 
the official tass news agency which announced formation of the 
new faction did not clarify if the faction was created by 
lawmakers in the supreme soviet or in the separate congress of 
peoples deputies a body created by gorbachev however it called 
the new faction a parliamentary group suggesting it is part of 
the congress

the party is over for the homeless 
who once feasted on cajunstyle blackened fish gourmet soups and 
rich desserts all leftovers from drexel burnham lambert incs 
beverly hills office 
for two years the homeless who gathered nightly at a nearby 
park often dined at picnic tables piled with tenderloin beef 
chicken breasts gourmet breads and new yorkstyle cheesecakes left 
from the companys lavish lunches but the bulk of drexels beverly 
hills staff faced layoffs today and the office was expected to 
close 
this will hurt because they were our major source of food and 
we have no one to replace them said ted landreth a spokesman 
for the greater west hollywood food coalition which distributes 
food to about 250 people in plummer park 
the food from drexel has been phenomenal better than at most 
deluxe restaurants expensive meats thick soups of all different 
varieties lovely salads landreth said 
in the companys heyday the coalition sent a car every day to 
pick up an estimated 500 worth of food or about 40 percent of its 
daily distribution that had been passed over by busy financial 
traders at the 400employee office 
drexel had offered the food free to employees on the advice of 
the companys junkbond chief michael milken who since has been 
fired and faces federal securitiesfraud charges 
it was michael milkens concept that everyone should be fed 
well everyone from the traders to the maintenance people ate 
well said neilson cook drexels food services director 
he figured that if they were eating at their desks they would 
be less likely to eat out and give away company secrets and he 
also wanted to keep the amount of time spent away from work at a 
minimum 
the investment banks parent company drexel burnham lambert 
group inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection tuesday and 
immediately began liquidating billions of dollars in assets

the second toxic chemical leak in two 
weeks at a plant considered among the most modern in the nation 
forced authorities to order 15000 residents to remain indoors 
about 500 gallons of muriatic acid leaked from a transfer hose 
at rhonepoulencs institute plant thursday no injuries were 
rported but fears that poisonous vapor released in the spill would 
spread over institute and neighboring st albans led officials to 
order people inside 
im certainly concerned said plant manager ron bearer 
this is a serious incident when we have to recommend to emergency 
services that people stay inside buildings 
the vapor didnt leave the plant and authorities lifted the 
order 30 minutes later 
in the first leak on feb 2 a small amount of methyl 
isocyanate or mic the same chemical that killed 3500 people in 
1984 at bhopal india escaped from a pipe and injured seven 
workers 
the occupational safety and health administration sent 
inspectors to the plant after the small mic leak they were still 
at the plant thursday and two more inspectors were dispatched to 
look into the muriatic acid leak said jack hord a spokesman for 
the us labor department 
after the bhopal leak and a series of leaks here in 1985 osha 
performed a walltowall inspection of the plant which then was 
wholly owned by union carbide the company was cited with 221 
violations 
a 137 million fine assessed by osha was settled out of court 
for 408500 on the condition carbide didnt have to admit fault 
the plant which is about 10 miles west of charleston and is now 
owned by both union carbide and rhonepoulenc a french company 
was considered by carbide as the safest in the nation after the 
company spent millions improving safety systems after the 1985 
leaks 
hord said the recent incidents dont mean this is an unsafe 
operation it doesnt compare to what happened in 1985 the 
problems at institute in 1985 were just multiplying you just have 
two incidents here 
after an august 1985 leak at institute 135 sought medical help 
at hospitals 
the muriatic acid leaked as workers filled a tank at the plants 
wastewater and sewage treatment plant where the chemical is used 
as a neutralizing agent a truck apparently ran over a hose 
causing it to split open bearer said 
muriatic acid is a mixture of hydrochloric acid and water 
a condensed solution of hydrochloric acid causes severe burns 
and permanent visual damage may occur according to the merck 
index an encyclopedia of chemicals if inhaled it can cause 
coughing choking and inflammation and ulceration of the 
respiratory tract 
the us coast guard stopped traffic on the kanawha river for 30 
minutes for fear the vapor cloud would sweep toward the river the 
cloud dissipated soon after it formed 
after the feb 2 leak the plant owners were criticized for 
waiting three days to notify county emergency officials bearer 
changed plant policy to require the reporting of all leaks 
community leaders praised the company for its fast reporting 
thursday kanawha county manager ron gregory said county emergency 
officials received word within 30 seconds of the leaks discovery 
i believe the recent mic incident may very well have had a 
beneficial effect gregory said it identified the 
communications problem we had thats now been corrected

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki told the 
east german leader today that poland must have at least a limited 
role in talks to reunify the germanys the polish news agency said 
mazowiecki meeting with east german prime minister hans modrow 
reiterated polish concerns that a united germany may seek to 
reclaim land ceded to poland after world war ii 
modrow was welcomed today at warsaws okecie airport by 
mazowiecki with whom he had two meetings scheduled on political 
and economic issues 
east and west germany and the four world war ii allies that 
divided them the united states soviet union britain and france 
plan a series of talks on eventual reunification 
mazowiecki described his first session with modrow as 
fruitful the official pap news agency reported 
both speakers in an open way expressed their views on the 
subject of the process which in the last few months has been 
developing and is leading to the reunification of germany 
mazowiecki told pap 
this process has to take into consideration the full security 
of the rights of german neighbors mazowiecki said 
poland doesnt have to take part in everything but it has to 
take part in everything that concerns poland it has to be 
present he added according to the pap report 
sessions were also planned with president wojciech jaruzelski 
and modrow was to address the foreign affairs committees of the two 
houses of parliament 
hans modrow will have a chance to join our postulate and 
voices of those states which think that poland must be included in 
the unification talks the government daily rzeczpospolita wrote 
today 
modrow has said he accepts polands western border as permanent 
east german government spokesman wolfgang meyer has attacked west 
german chancellor helmut kohl for failing to assure poland there 
would be no effort by a united germany to reclaim former german 
territory forfeited after world war ii 
however modrow is likely not to be much of a factor in the 
talks his communistled government which took over when the 
former stalinist dictatorship was overthrown last year is expected 
to be ousted when east germans hold their first free elections on 
march 18 
west germany has also said it has no territorial claims on 
poland but kohl has said he cannot speak on the subject for a 
reunified germany 
west germany foreign minister hans dietrichgenscher on 
thursday rejected polish participation in the talks saying no 
polish territories would be included in the reunited germany 
but with no unequivocal statement renouncing future claims such 
reassurances are unconvincing to poles subject to past german 
aggression and wary of german conservatives who contend germany 
still in theory exists within its 1937 borders 
the polish border along the oder and neisse rivers incorporates 
40000 square miles of territory ceded by germany following world 
war ii to compensate for an even larger territory taken from 
poland in the east by the soviet union 
jaruzelski on thursday called the border issue a question of 
life or death for poland 
more than 46 percent of the 1803 poles surveyed thursday in 50 
towns nationwide by the gazeta wyborcza newspaper said they felt 
fear at the potential reunification of germany 
only 7 percent said they greeted the prospect with joy and 
226 percent said they had mixed feelings according to the poll 
published today the rest said they were indifferent held another 
opinion or no opinion

imelda marcos cannot view classified government 
documents to prepare for her federal racketeering trial next month 
a judge has ruled 
us district judge john keenan in a written decision thursday 
said lawyers for the widow of deposed philippine leader ferdinand 
marcos had not proven that the us government had assembled an 
interagency task force to investigate her and her husband 
to say that it is clear there was is advocacy run amuck 
keenan said in denying her request for classified documents from 
more than a dozen government agencies 
these included the departments of justice defense and treasury 
the offices of the president and vice president the cia fbi 
national security agency the navy and the us embassy in manila 
the judge also scoffed at claims by her lawyers that mrs marcos 
and her husband were kidnapped from the philippines by american 
military forces after marcos ouster in february 1986 
keenan cited a june 1988 letter from marcos to president reagan 
in which he thanked reagan for his hospitality of two years ago and 
wrote how he came to the united states at your invitation 
this is hardly the language of a kidnap victim keenan said 
the judge has yet to rule on a separate motion by mrs marcos that 
claims the us government has no jurisdiction to prosecute her 
because she was brought to this country against her will 
mrs marcos who lives in hawaii is scheduled to go to trial 
march 13 on charges that she and her husband embezzled more than 
100 million from the philippine treasury to buy art and manhattan 
real estate they also were charged with defrauding banks of 165 
million in loans 
marcos died in exile in hawaii on sept 28 at age 72 
prosecutors opposed the request for the classified documents 
calling it a fishing expedition 
keenan noted that the prosecution had already turned over to 
mrs marcos lawyers about 350000 documents videotapes and other 
items seized in its investigation

an international group screening the sale of 
sensitive technology has granted preferential treatment to eastern 
europe recognizing it no longer presents a serious strategic 
threat a us official said today 
however the united states blocked moves by the majority of the 
group to grant the same preferred status to the soviet union 
the strategic threat is changing and cocom must adapt said 
a us delegate to the special twoday executive meeting of the 
coordination committee for multilateral export control the paris 
session ended late thursday 
but another official close to the talks also speaking on 
condition of anonymity said i dont think the americans 
conceded anything their position is thoroughly old fashioned 
based on the cold war perception of the soviet union as a country 
with missiles aimed at americas heartland there is no recognition 
of the changes no sympathy for the problems there 
decisions are reached by consensus among cocom members which 
include japan australia and all 16 nato countries except iceland 
the group formed about 40 years ago screens technology exports to 
prevent sensitive items from being diverted to military uses by 
communist governments 
but their work has become far more complex with the rapid moves 
toward democracy by the soviet union and countries such as 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland the three nations which stand 
to benefit immediately by the new preferred status which means 
their applications will be more favorably viewed 
cocom said an intensified review would begin immediately aimed 
at loosening the list of controlled hightech goods in the areas of 
telecommunications machine tools and computers the areas most 
meaningful to the development of the east the us official said 
for a country on the prohibited list to buy certain sensitive 
items it must be granted an exception by cocom the three areas to 
be liberalized represent more than half of all the exceptions 
granted the official said 
the official said cocom had received overtures from 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland who promised to protect western 
technology if allowed to purchase the sensitive items 
even with the change of status however eastern europe will not 
have the status enjoyed by china 
theres still the question of diversion to soviet military 
use thats not a problem with china the us official said

industrial production slipped 12 percent in 
january the government said today as abnormally warm weather 
reduced utility use and automakers temporarily laid off workers to 
reduce bloated inventories 
the federal reserve said januarys decline followed a revised 
02 percent gain in output a month earlier as a major strike ended 
at the boeing co and utilities fired up their operations to meet 
the demand prompted by the fourth coldest december on record 
decembers increase originally was reported to be 04 percent 
it was the first dip in production since a 03 drop last october 
in january the output of motor vehicles was curtailed 
drastically and the extremely warm weather caused a sharp drop in 
utilities output the department said 
output at utilities fell 107 percent last month the warmest 
january in 96 years of government weather recordkeeping reversing 
a huge 63 percent advance in december 
and the layoffs at auto factories drove overall manufacturing 
production down 09 percent manufacturing output represents 84 
percent of the index 
automobile assemblies plunged to a 41 million unit annual 
rate from a 62 million unit rate in december the department 
said 
the interestsensitive manufacturing sector has been among the 
hardest hit by federal reserve efforts to restrain inflation by 
keeping a tight grip on credit 
production of durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years fell 17 percent after rising 03 percent 
in december and 04 percent in november 
nondurable goods production increased 02 percent reversing a 
02 percent decline in december it rose 02 percent a month 
earlier 
output at mines aided by the warmer weather rose 21 percent 
after a 20 percent decline in december and a 02 percent gain in 
november 
the changes meant the industrial production index in january 
stood at 1409 percent of its 1977 base down from 1425 percent a 
month earlier 
in another report the fed said the operating rate of the 
nations factories mines and utilities dipped 12 percentage point 
to 819 percent in january 
factory use had remained steady at a revised 831 percent in 
december largely because of the weatherrelated 5 percentage point 
hike to 864 percent in the utility rate it was the sharpest 
utilityrate increase in the 23year history of the governments 
capacity utilization reports 
the factoryuse rate was 831 percent in both october and 
november 
but reflecting the warmer weather in january the utility rate 
plummeted to 771 percent the department attributed the fall in 
large part to a 10 percentage oint drop in power plant utilization 
the operating rate measures not only output but also changes in 
productivity levels 
while it reflected sluggish output the report could be 
interpreted as good news for consumers the closer us industry 
gets to full operating capacity the greater difficulty it has 
producing enough to meet demand leading to shortages and 
subsequent price increases 
analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or 
above as an indication of inflationary pressures 
the manufacturingplant operating rate in january slipped to 
819 percent from 829 percent in december the rate had peaked at 
847 percent in january 1989 
the rate at factories producing durable goods fell from 809 
percent to 794 percent 
operating rates for auto and truck assembly facilities dropped 
to levels near their 1982 recession lows the department said 
the rate at factories producing nondurable goods fell 01 
percentage point to 856 percent the operating rate at mines was 
down 08 percentage point to 8847 percent

united mine workers strikers won 
concessions on health care and pension benefits and pittston coal 
group got the ability to run its mines almost nonstop in a proposed 
settlement distributed to miners today 
if approved by the umws rankandfile in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky the settlement could resolve the unions 
bitter and sporadically violent 10month strike against the 
nations largest coal exporter by next week 
the associated press obtained a copy of the proposed contract 
from a source who insisted on anonymity since pittston and the 
union negotiators reached agreement on new years eve they have 
kept contract details secret while both sides moved to dismiss 
lawsuits and fines stemming from the strike 
umw president richard trumka announced thursday that union 
members would vote on the pact monday despite 64 million in fines 
pending in a virginia state court for illegal strike activity 
more than 2000 union members packed into a building at the 
russell county fairgrounds this morning to receive copies of the 
49page contract listen to pep talks by the unions top officers 
and receive a briefing on the terms 
trumka choked back tears as he congratulated the miners on what 
he said was a successful strike 
im proud im proud you did this trumka said as he raised 
the contract in the air to a round of applause 
some miners grumbled about terms in the contract but most gave 
it a favorable review 
theres some good some bad said jack hale a 48yearold 
laidoff miner well just have to weigh the good against the 
bad 
the proposal in many respects mirrors health and pension 
benefits contained in the 1988 bituminous coal operators 
association contract the industrys national labor contract 
but it differs in two significant respects pittston won the 
ability to hire contract truck drivers and maintenance workers as 
long as union miners are not laid off in the process and the 
company would be able to run its mines aroundtheclock and 
sevendaysaweek except for christmas and the sunday day shift 
wages were not a major issue in the strike but miners would 
receive a cumulative 120anhour raise at the end of three years 
topscale hourly pay in selected positions would be 1752 
pittston dropped out of the healthcare plan negotiated between 
the union and the bcoa and spurred the strike by proposing payment 
of 80 percent of the covered medical expenses rather than 100 
percent 
the umw won its demand to maintain 100 percent medical coverage 
for employees pensioners and their families 
the contract has a new healthcost containment provision in 
which pittston issues 500 twiceayear to each miner and pensioner 
under the age of 65 to cover their deductibles 
after it dropped out of the bcoa pittston stopped contributing 
to the multiemployer retirement fund and promised to take care of 
its own retirees it now has agreed to go back to the union pension 
fund 
pension benefits in the new contract are identical to those 
contained in the 1988 national agreement according to a contract 
summary 
the company wanted to be able to contract out work in five job 
categories but won the limited right in two areas transportation 
of coal and repair and maintenance work 
the company wanted to eliminate a provision that union contracts 
are not broken when a union mine changes hands or is conveyed from 
one subsidiary to another 
but the settlement retains the successorship provision in the 
1984 agreement and contains strengthened protection for umwa 
members against internal company reorganization and shifting of 
coal lands the contract said 
pittstons significant victory was its request to establish 
roundtheclock operations 
during negotiations the company dropped its original demand for 
a sunday day shift with four 10hour shifts a week instead of five 
eighthour shifts and the ability to call in workers for 
reasonable overtime with 12 hours notice on a mandatory basis 
the umw wanted to stick with its traditional fixed fiveday work 
week 
the contract contains two flextime work schedules in 
addition to the regular work week the flextime allows the company 
to work continuously 
pittston did not want to reinstate miners convicted of 
strikerelated felonies the umw wanted all miners reinstated a 
mention of the issue could not be found in the labor agreement

the partially burned body of foreign 
minister robert ouko was found today near his western kenya home 
three days after his mysterious disappearance 
the government indicated he had been murdered 
the discovery of oukos body was announced by president daniel 
arap moi who said it was found in circumstances which at the 
moment suggest foul play 
the body of the 58yearold minister was found in a sugar cane 
field about four miles from his family farm in koru not far from 
lake victoria 
the presidents statement said the body was partly burned and 
pledged that anyone who may be associated with this horrible 
event will most certainly be apprehended 
ouko considered one of the most skilled members of mois 
cabinet dropped from sight tuesday his disappearance went 
unreported until thursday evening when the offical kenya news 
agency broadcast an appeal from family members urging him to 
contact them or government officials 
moi said oukos death was a loss for the whole nation 
calling him a brilliant leader an articulate and courageous 
spokesman of this country and a loyal servant of the people 
the minister appeared largely above the fray of kenyan politics 
his name rarely appearing in almost daily press accounts of 
rivalries within the countrys single ruling party 
ouko was last seen publicly on saturday when he addressed a 
service club in kisumu 220 miles northwest of nairobi and not far 
from his koru home 
staterun radio and television stations quoted unidentified 
family members thursday night as saying no one had seen him leave 
his farm after he went to bed monday night 
the kenya times a nairobi daily newspaper reported today that 
a white car arrived at oukos home at about 3 am tuesday and left 
with the minister the paper attributed its report to two 
unidentified household employees 
before the discovery of oukos body a senior government 
official speaking on condition of anonymity said people are 
wondering how a full minister can disappear he referred to the 
fact that the homes of cabinet ministers are always guarded by 
armed policemen they also use bodyguards when they travel 
ouko first served as permanent secretary in the ministry of 
foreign affairs in 196364 he then held a number of other 
highranking government jobs before being tapped by moi to head the 
foreign ministry in 1979

air quality officials say they hope 
other companies will heed an agreement by lockheed aeronautical 
systems co to pay a 1 million fine for inadequate smog control 
record keeping 
we hope this settlement sends a message to the regulated 
community that the aqmd is determined to crack down on socalled 
technical violations such as record keeping because these 
violations have a serious effect on our air pollution problem 
said diana love chief prosecutor for the south coast air quality 
management district 
the agency described the civil penalty announced thursday as a 
landmark air pollution settlement under which lockheed promised to 
use more sophisticated painting equipment to cut down on pollution 
most violations involved errors in records related to the use of 
coatings and solvents the burbankbased aerospace manufacturer 
said 
some of the coatings and solvents the company uses emit volatile 
organic compounds that are key ingredients of smog lockheed is 
allowed to use those materials under a plan in which the company 
also uses coatings and solvents with lowerthanrequired emission 
levels 
lockheed has assured the district that it wants to protect the 
environment and is committed to complying with district rules 
said dale daniels lockheed executive vice president 
lockheed said it will have a central dispensing station for its 
coatings and solvents to better monitor their use the company 
also agreed to outfit all its plants with the latest pollution

newspaper red star 
tadzhikistan which borders china and afghanistan about 1600 
miles southeast of moscow is the latest in a string of republics 
torn by ethnic strife since mikhail s gorbachev came to power five 
years ago and relaxed some controls he has repeatedly warned that 
the turmoil threatens his reform program and has had to resort to 
force to put down uprisings in several republics that killed 
hundreds of people

nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel is calling 
for mikhail gorbachev to personally condemn a growing number of 
antisemitic incidents in the soviet union 
wiesel said at a news conference thursday that during a visit to 
moscow last month all the jews with whom he spoke agreed the 
situation is becoming increasingly dangerous in six visits to 
the soviet union he said he had never seen jews there living 
and dwelling in such fear 
he said he was told of many cases in which jews were publicly 
beaten or insulted as police or soldiers looked on impassively 
the time has come for gorbachev personally to address the 
issue wiesel said it must come from him directly clearly 
he said he supported the soviet presidents reforms and was 
confident of his intentions 
im convinced gorbachev is not pleased with antisemitism in 
the soviet union he said im convinced he would like it to 
disappear 
soviet officials have warned that fanning racial hatred is a 
crime punishable by imprisonment but some soviet jews have 
complained that not enough is being done to protect them from 
attacks by rightwing groups that have flourished in the soviet 
union as central authority has waned

six palestinians dragged an alleged arab 
informer into the square of a west bank village and axed him to 
death in front of about 250 spectators arab reporters said today 
villagers chanted kill him kill him after the man 
confessed through mosque loudspeakers that he had informed on 
fellow palestinians since 1968 and once led three plo men into an 
army ambush the reporters said 
the body of mohammed khatatbeh 52 was found today in the 
village square in beit furik near the west bank city of nablus 
arab reporters said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the incident began tuesday when six gunmen in camouflage 
uniforms kidnapped khatatbeh from his beit furik home a day later 
they took him to the village mosque where he confessed to being an 
informer the report said 
late thursday khatatbehs captors hacked him with axes and 
knives in the beit furik square as villagers looked on the army 
confirmed that a body was found and said police were investigating 
the case 
the public slaying of khatatbeh was rare since alleged 
collaborators usually are slain without witnesses with their 
bodies later left in public places to warn wouldbe collaborators 
khatatbehs death brought to 185 the number of palestinians 
slain by fellow arabs during the 26monthold uprising against 
israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip some 656 palestinians 
have been killed by israeli soldiers and civilians and 43 israelis 
also have died in the violence 
also today the army defended itself against palestinian 
accusations that soldiers seeking a suspected activist fired wildly 
into his home killing a teenage girl and that border police beat 
more than 40 high school students who were in custody 
an army official said preliminary findings showed that in the 
first case a soldier shot the girl to death on dec 22 after she 
stabbed his hand as he broke a window and tried to enter her house 
the official was unable to say if other relatives were wounded 
in the other case the army said it stood by its report that the 
40 students in bethlehem were all hurt falling from a wall as they 
fled paramilitary border police after a stonethrowing attack 
the army response came after the jerusalem post quoted school 
officials as saying the students were being held in a schoolyard 
and palestinian doctors as saying the students injuries appeared 
to be from beatings not from falls 
one doctor told the newspaper that not one student suffered a 
sprained ankle the most common injury in falls

a man targeted in the probe of a series of mail 
bombs across the southeast twice appealed a case to the court on 
which a slain judge sat a court official said today 
judge robert s vance of the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
was one of two victims of the bombs sent to targets in georgia 
alabama and florida 
walter leroy moody of rex one of three men investigated by the 
fbi in connection with the mail bombs was charged in 1983 with 
attempted murder in florida court documents show that moody using 
the name roy moody appealed in december 1988 the dismissal of a 
lawsuit alleging malicious prosecution and false arrest in that 
case 
a panel of the 11th circuit including vance dismissed moodys 
appeal a court official who asked that his name not be used said 
the panel did not hold a hearing before dismissing the appeal and 
moody never appeared before the court 
moody again appealed the dismissal in august 1989 court 
documents show that vance and two other circuit judges heard oral 
arguments in miami on aug 29 but the case is still pending 
the court keeps no transcripts of oral arguments and has no way 
of knowing whether moody was present at the hearing the court 
official said moodys attorney grafton carlson of fort 
lauderdale argued the case 
moody 55 appealed over allegations made during the 1983 case 
in which he was charged with abandoning in the gulf of mexico three 
georgia divers he had hired to photograph an underwater propulsion 
device he planned to market jurors were deadlocked and the judge 
declared a mistrial the state decided against retrying moody 
vance was killed by a bomb sent to his mountain brook ala 
home dec 16 two days later savannah ga lawyer robert robinson 
died after he opened a mail bomb sent to his office two other 
bombs were sent to targets in atlanta and jacksonville fla but 
were intercepted by authorities 
investigators have searched the homes and businesses of three 
men including moody in alabama and georgia 
no arrests have been made in the case 
meanwhile moodys attorneys sought a gag order thursday which 
would restrict information about the case 
the attorneys asked us district judge richard c freeman to 
issue the gag order to seal all documents in the case and to order 
the return of materials seized by agents who searched moodys 
clayton county home last week 
the request met opposition from lawyers for several news 
organizations 
freeman said he needed more time to study documents filed in the 
case he scheduled another hearing for wednesday and said that a 
portion of the hearing may be closed 
moodys lawyers including the local president of the american 
civil liberties union argued that the intense publicity over the 
bombs case has hurt their clients reputation

about 1500 students chanting prodemocracy slogans and waving 
placards marched today to the chinese diplomatic mission to protest 
the agreements announced would increase the number of seats 
directly elected to the 19951999 legislatures from 18 to 20 there 
are 60 seats in legislature which is chosen by the government and 
special interest groups

democratization than provided in the first draft of the 
constitution known as the basic law 
in london foreign secretary douglas hurd said today that the 
agreement produced a substantially greater first step toward 
democracy in hk than was planned two years ago 
we shall continue to press the case for a faster pace of 
democratization there will be further evolution between now and 
1997 hurd told the house of commons 
he has caved in completely to china responded gerald 
kaufman the opposition labor partys spokesman on foreign affairs 
although he told the people of hong kong last month that 
britain alone was responsible for governing hong kong until july 
1997 his surrender to china on elections to the legislative 
council has in fact given china a decisive voice in what happens in 
hong kong not in 1997 but now 
one hong kong representative dr raymond wu told reporters 
that the decisions represented only a little bit of improvement 
bits and pieces 
china has pledged to allow the thriving british territory to 
retain its capitalist economy and lifestyle for 50 years britain

officials from 24 western nations 
gathered today to consider of litany of requests for financial help 
from five eastern european countries trying to convert to 
freemarket economies 
the officials streamed into a building near the headquarters of 
the 12nation european community to consider the requests of 
romania bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany and yugoslavia 
the new governments in those once solidly communist countries 
want to be included in a program originally set up last summer to 
promote economic and political change in poland and hungary 
foreign ministers of the 24 western nations taking part in the 
program have agreed in principle to offer assistance to the other 
countries to encourage their drives toward democracy and 
freemarket economies 
but it was unclear whether the lowerranking officials meeting 
today would give the goahead to put together packages of aid for 
the others 
some had indicated before the meeting a final decision was 
unlikely and would probably be deferred to their foreign ministers 
expected to meet later in the year possibly in june 
but others today appeared ready to act more quickly youve 
got to maintain the momentum said another official as he entered 
the conference he demanded anonymity 
the plan is one of several western mechanisms aimed at restoring 
economic health to eastern european economies languishing after 
decades of central planning under hardline communist rule 
the aid programs are expected to amount to the largest campaign 
of regional assistance since the marshall plan rebuilt western 
europe after world war ii 
in july president bush and other key leaders of industrial 
nations put the european community a group of western european 
nations in charge of fashioning an economic aid package for poland 
and hungary 
since then other emerging democracies in eastern europe have 
appealed for help 
officials said bulgaria romania east germany czechoslovakia 
and yugoslavia have submitted papers giving details of their reform 
efforts and outlining their economic needs 
the appeals varied widely romania said the new government has 
been left with an economy in deep crisis 
czechoslovakia said there is no unemployment in 
czechoslovakia however a considerable part of the labor force is 
tied up in inefficient operations 
yugoslavia said it would need 2 billion to rebuild its banking 
system and convert to a freemarket economy 
several expressed concern about the effect of wrenching economic 
changes on their people bulgaria said an economic program has to 
be supplemented by a feasible and economically sustainable social 
program 
east germany said however it can fall back on its welltrained 
labor force agricultural sector and technical base 
relying on its own performance and making use of the economic 
support being offered to it east germany has an opportunity to 
achieve economic reform without going through periods of acute 
social tension it said 
the nations are all trying to move their economies to the 
freemarket models of the west but some such as poland are 
strapped with hefty foreign debts polish prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki has already asked the creditor nations would accept a 
moratorium of payments on their share of polands 39 billion 
foreign debt while he implements a radical economic plan to 
transform polands economy 
their requests are expected to be discussed at the meeting of 
the group of 24 the name given to the western nations 
participating in the program but officials said they doubted 
whether any final decisions would be made on extending the aid 
program 
foreign ministers of the participating nations are likely to 
meet later in the year to settle the question 
under the program about 6 billion has been granted or promised 
to poland and hungary in the coming years according to officials 
the aid ranges from emergency food shipments for poland to export 
and investment credits for both countries 
the soviet union has not been invited to submit a request for 
help 
nations attending the meeting include the european community 
members britain ireland norway denmark belgium the 
netherlands luxembourg germany france spain italy and portugal 
also attending were austria australia canada finland 
iceland japan new zealand norway sweden switzerland turkey 
and the united states

television commercials featuring chuck yeager 
promoting northrop corp as a conscientious defense contractor were 
ordered off the air by a federal judge presiding over the aviation 
companys fraud trial 
judge pamela ann rymer said thursday the commercials could bias 
potential jurors 
the advertisements featuring the legendary test pilot have been 
running for several weeks jury selection begins tuesday 
in my judgment the running of these ads at this time is a 
serious threat to the impartiality of the trial on which we are 
about to embark the judge said 
northrop and two employees are charged with fraud in the av8b 
harrier jet program northrop is accused of failing to test key 
parts the company built for the military jet 
the judges order bars the showing of the commercials in the los 
angeles media market until the end of the trial in her court and 
another in which northrop is accused of fraud in the cruise missile 
program 
the ruling applies only to the hard work series of ads in 
which yeager vouches for northrop and employees describe the firm 
as a hardworking scrupulous and professional contractor dedicated 
to quality 
northrop attorney brad brian argued that the company had a 
very substantial first amendment interest in using the 
commercials to battle bad publicity from the trials 
rymer recently was appointed to the us circuit court of 
appeals but is hearing the case as a federal district judge

former president nixon says he understands why 
president bush ordered the invasion of panama but believes that 
generally the united states should not act directly to depose 
foreign leaders of whom it disapproves 
nixon and former presidents reagan carter and ford were asked 
by the sunday newspaper supplement usa weekend for their views on 
the invasion of panama 
i support the bush administration said reagan a republican 
as is bush the desposed panamanian leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega now facing drug charges in the united states is where 
he belongs and the people of panama are beginning to put the pieces 
back together he said 
ford another republican said i applaud the presidents 
strong action 
carter a democrat said i deplore the invasion and feel a 
great responsibility now for our nation to help repair the damage 
caused by us economic embargo and our military action however 
he added perhaps the invasion can bring about real freedom 
democracy and economic prosperity for panama 
republican nixon said i understand why president bush acted 
as he did on the other hand he said when the united states 
decides by itself who is going to run a country it runs the risk 
of ending up running the country itself 
nixon carter and reagan replied in writing to questions 
submitted by the publication ford was interviewed by telephone 
all four indicated they had no interest in returning to the 
presidency and all said they believed there should not be a formal 
role in government for former presidents such as a seat as 
senatoratlarge as has been suggested occasionally 
our constitution is clear on who is and who is not an official 
part of the government said reagan 
carter agreed that former presidents should have no formal role 
but said they should be willing to serve in special cases when 
requested by the incumbent president 
similarly ford said my experience has been that a sitting 
president does call upon a former president informally and i have 
worked with president carter president reagan and now president 
bush when ive been asked to 
said nixon there is a great deal former presidents can 
contribute to thier country but another bureaucracy should not be 
one of them

a federal agency has proposed that 44 billion 
worth of pollutioncontrol equipment be installed at a northern 
arizona power plant to cut emissions blamed for wintertime haze at 
the grand canyon 
the environmental protection agencys proposal has yet to be 
approved by the white house and its office of management and budget 
and should not be considered definite officials cautioned this 
week 
its just a proposal at this point proposals have been 
changed before said christine shaver an attorney with the 
national park service in denver 
david stonefield head of the epas office of air quality 
research in research triangle park nc said the epa was 
proposing a 90 percent reduction in sulfurdioxide emissions from 
300 tons a day to 30 tons from the navajo generating stations 
three 770foot stacks 
the epa estimates that emissions from the coalfired plant near 
page fouls as many as 15 percent of the days at the canyon from 
november through march it also says it is possible that the 
plants emissions may cause haze during other seasons 
the utilities that own the plant led by the salt river project 
based in phoenix dispute the epas contention that the plant is 
responsible for haze at the canyon salt river officials and 
consultants have cited automobile pollution from the los angeles 
area as a more likely cause 
john mcnamara a salt river project associate general manager 
said he was not surprised by the epas proposal but he said his 
utility was pleased that the epa had agreed to consider salt 
rivers own 10 million study into whether the plant is causing the 
canyon haze 
results of that study are expected before a decision is made on 
the epa proposal possibly in october 
the epa estimated the cost of pollutioncontrol equipment at 
44 million while salt river has said it would cost 16 billion 
a lawyer in boulder colo for the environmental defense fund 
called the epa proposal a very positive sign 
its significant in that they ask for a 90 percent reduction 
which is everything weve asked for said robert yuhnke whose 
group filed a 1982 lawsuit that forced the epa to check into the 
canyon haze

new york states education policysetting 
board voted today to change the way history is taught to include 
more about contributions by nonwhites 
the board of regents voted unanimously to appoint a team of 
scholars who will try to wipe out examples of bias from history 
books and classroom curricula 
we have to understand better than we now do the diversity of 
the country said state education commissioner thomas sobol 
the action came seven months after a task force appointed by 
sobol and dominated by nonwhites released a report that said much 
of what school children learn in new york is based on hidden 
assumptions of white supremacy 
the report titled a curriculum of inclusion suggested that 
many courses minimize the contributions of minorities and largely 
ignore the wrongs committed by whites against nonwhites 
the team of scholars to be picked by sobol will study state 
curricula to determine how they can be improved the regents 
decided to establish a separate and permanent advisory council to 
make sure all ethnic groups receive appropriate and accurate 
attention in classes and books 
some regents suggested the changes would be more beneficial to 
whites than blacks and other minorities 
many of our children who have successfully come through our 
system do not know each other and do not have a legitimate basis 
for developing respect for each other said adelaide sanford a 
former high school principal from new york city 
regent walter cooper said it was important for schools to 
incorporate the information about minorities into traditional 
textbooks and not as separate units on nonwhite cultures 
one regent edward meyer suggested putting off action for a 
month so it could be studied more but sobol noting the 
controversy the report has generated in educational circles said 
any delay would send the wrong signal 
some members of the policysetting board testy about the 
controversy generated by the report in recent months said the 
state has been moving to include more minority contributions for 15 
years 
i think the teachers of this state are doing what weve been 
talking about here said regent laura chodos we just dont 
know about it

the government has agreed to end 
restrictions on private farming by lifting curbs on how much land 
individuals can till the state bta news agency reported today 
a government decree slated for publication later in the day 
will encourage free enterprise in agriculture bta said 
reporting on a cabinet meeting thursday restrictions on the size 
of land plots available for cultivation by private farmers will be 
lifted 
farmers had been allowed private ownership of only small strips 
of land primarily meant to fulfill their own needs and that of 
their families 
bta did not indicate whether the farmers would now be free to 
buy as much land as they wanted or whether they would have to lease 
additional acreage for private use 
the decision was among the efforts by the moderately reformist 
communist government to defuse pressure from the opposition for the 
introduction of market mechanisms into the moribund economy 
complicating the generally stagnant economic picture in recent 
months has been an unprecedented wave of strikes generally for 
better wages that has resulted in the loss of hundreds of 
thousands of manhours of production 
bulgaria also is wrestling with a gross foreign debt of more 
than 10 billion one of the highest per capita in the soviet bloc 
in an apparent bid to strengthen its creditworthiness the 
government also decided to apply for membership in the 
international monetary fund and the international bank for

the first american experiment aboard the 
soviet space station mir will return to earth on a soviet soyuz 
spacecraft monday the company that created the experiment said 
friday 
payload systems inc of cambridge mass said the protein 
crystal growth will have spent 61 days in orbit the longest period 
in weightlessness for a such an experiment 
the experiment was launched on a soviet spacecraft dec 20 after 
payload systems became the first us company authorized by the 
department of commerce to fly experiments aboard the mir the 
company has contracted with the soviets to fly six more experiments 
over a fouryear period 
protein crystal experiments have been flown a number of times on 
the us space shuttle but those flights have lasted only seven to 
10 days extended exposure to weightlessness is believed to be 
important in the growth of protein crystals 
experts use protein crystals to understand the fundamental 
structure of biological proteins once the crystal pattern is 
analyzed companies can make pharmaceuticals that will have 
specific effects such designer drugs are believed to be 
important in the future treatment of many diseases 
the company said the experiment should arrive in the united 
states on wednesday and the protein crystals will be removed

west german officials today unveiled 
plans for a military defense strategy for a united germany that 
would include nato membership a move opposed by the soviet union 
the government also announced plans for a 16state government 
that would encompass west and east germany 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg met with 
reporters today to discuss a common security concept that he said 
was being drafted by his ministry 
defense obligations are indivisible and cannot be weakened for 
a whole germany stoltenberg said noting that military 
integration would be an important initial step in a single german 
state 
he said that a cornerstone of the joint force would be its 
membership in the north atlantic treaty organization the soviet 
union has insisted a united germany be neutral 
despite stoltenbergs proposal the military alignment of a 
united germany is to be the subject of reunification talks this 
year among the german states soviets the united states britain 
and france 
washington wants at least the west german portion to remain in 
nato east germany is a key component of the sovietled warsaw pact 
whether germany should be in nato or neutral is likely to become 
an issue in the west german national elections in december 
stoltenberg said there likely would be a transition phase during 
which the east and west german armies would be merged but we are 
not going to have two different armed forces in a united germany 
for long stoltenberg said 
there was no immediate comment from the soviets or opposition 
leaders 
the governors of west germanys 11 states met today to discuss 
how a united germany would be administered in a rare show of unity 
among the state leaders split roughly equally between supporters of 
chancellor helmut kohl and the opposition social democrats the 
governors voted unanimously to pursue a 16state federal structure 
once the germanys are united 
they proposed that the east german territory be divided into 
five states along the borders of the traditional regions whose 
names in german are brandenburg mecklenburg sachsen 
sachsenanhalt and thueringen 
their promotion of a strong federal system where individual 
states enjoy broad autonomy and influence over the central 
government reflects the governors interest in setting up a united 
germany in the image of the west german and us federal models 
the conservative governor of badenwuerttemberg state lothar 
spaeth appealed to east germans to save years of legislative 
haggling by simply adopting west german laws and regulations he 
said a wholesale borrowing of the legislation would speed monetary 
union and economic reform 
kohls conservative christian democrats and the leftleaning 
social democrats have been wrapping themselves in the reunification 
issue in anticipation of the coming elections 
during a raucous parliament session on thursday kohl was 
accused of trying to take credit for the reunification 
developments which have been proceeding at a breakneck pace some 
officials say one germany could be formed this year 
but the race to reunify has some european neighbors and victims 
of the nazi regime worried about the rise of a powerful germany 
that could again threaten peace and security 
the reunification issue caught fire last year after the revolts 
against hardline communist regimes swept into east germany 
toppling the government but creating a political and economic void

trabelsi died of respiratory complications from the surgery which 
was performed feb 9 israel radio reported 
a granddaughter sara trabelsi said the woman had been 
unconscious toward the end of the week and that some of her 258 
children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren were at her bedside 
when she died 
she so much wanted to die with her leg maybe she lost her 
will to live without it she told the associated press 
mrs trabelsis leg became infected last month as a result of 
circulatory problems and bloodclotting but she refused to consent 
to the amputation because she wanted to enter the garden of eden 
on both feet 
the state took mrs trabelsi to court when doctors said she 
would probably die without the surgery but the case was dropped 
when a geriatric specialist testified that mrs trabelsi understood 
the possible consequences of her decision 
mrs trabelsi finally consented to the operation at the urging 
of mordechai eliahu one of israels leading rabbis 
her granddaughter said that mrs trabelsi would be buried friday 
with the amputated limb in accordance with jewish tradition 
grandma ruth will be buried with her amputated leg so that 
she can fulfill her wish to enter the garden of eden on both 
feet she said 
israel radio friday quoted hospital doctors as saying the delay 
in the operation caused by the court case had not helped mrs 
trabelsis condition and that she had been attached to a respirator 
since the surgery

hundreds of people gathered at a village square 
in the west bank to watch palestinian militants hack to death an 
arab man who admitted being an informer for israel arab reporters 
said friday 
the body of the victim mohammed khatatbeh was left in the 
central square in the village of beit furik and his family was not 
allowed to bury him in the town the reporters said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
at least 185 palestinians have been killed by their brethren 
since the uprising against israeli rule of the west bank and gaza 
strip began in december 1987 like khatatbeh most were accused of 
cooperating with israeli authorities 
according to the arab reporters khatatbeh was kidnapped tuesday 
from his beit furik home by six palestinians armed with pistols and 
dressed in camouflage uniforms the following day they took him to 
the village mosque where he confessed over a loudspeaker that he 
had informed on fellow palestinians since 1968 and once led three 
plo men into an army ambush 
israeli officials say palestinian activists often use torture 
and violent interrogations to force such confessions from suspected 
collaborators 
the militants then asked what should be done with khatatbeh and 
hundreds of villagers poured into the streets and chanted kill 
him kill him 
khatatbeh was hacked to death with axes and knives in the square 
late thursday as about 250 villagers looked on the reporters said 
the army command confirmed that a body was found in beit furik 
and said the case was being investigated 
in addition to the alleged collaborators another 656 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians in 
the uprising and 43 israelis have died 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said friday that israel should give 
up the occupied territories and concentrate on absorbing the 
hundreds of thousands of soviet jews expected to immigrate to 
israel 
kollek jerusalems mayor for the last 25 years said israel 
will need so many human and material resources to handle the 
immigration flow that i maintain it is impossible to continue at 
the same time to occupy the west bank and gaza 
kolleks remarks were in an essay distributed by his office in 
reply to prime minister yitzhak shamirs comment jan 15 suggesting 
that israel needed to keep the occupied lands to settle some 
300000 soviet jews expected to arrive in the next three years 
shamirs statement drew angry arab responses as well as 
condemnations from the soviet union and united states which 
consider settlement of the occupied lands an obstacle to peace 
shamir has since reiterated that there was no government policy of 
settling immigrants in the occupied lands 
also friday the foreign ministry said european sanctions 
against israel for its handling of the palestinian uprising were 
counterproductive and would discourage peace efforts 
israel flatly rejects the attempt by the commission of the 
european community and the european parliament to suspend certain 
activities with israel the ministry said in a statement these 
attempts discourage dialogue and work against peace 
a week ago the european commission indefinitely postponed two 
scheduled europeanisraeli seminars one on economic cooperation 
and the other on science 
earlier the 518member european parliament voted in midjanuary

waterways in this flowergrowing region with pesticides including 
such banned substances as ddt to protect their crops water 
officials said friday

bulb growing area and their levels were far above the norms in 
most cases said hans van der hoek a spokesman for the local 
water management board 
in samples weve even found longbanned substances such as 
ddt aldrin and dieldrin van der hoek told the associated press 
all three are highly toxic substances but van der hoek said it 
had not been determined if the pesticide levels in the water were a 
threat to public health

just north of this western dutch city the remainder is spread over 
the northwestern and central netherlands

in a major breakthrough the exiled 
leadership of the african national congress said today it would 
send a delegation to south africa for talks with president fw de 
klerk 
the meeting would be the first ever between the guerrilla 
movements exiled leaders and a south african head of state the 
talks would focus on removing obstacles to formal negotiations 
both sides say they want to work out a new constitution that would 
include the black majority 
alfred nzo secretarygeneral of the anc also said the 
guerrilla movement was prepared to negotiate a suspension of 
hostilities once de klerk meets the groups remaining conditions 
for formal talks the anc has said the whiteled government must 
release all political prisioners lift the state of emergency and 
allow exiles to return before formal negotiations begin 
de klerk has said he plans to take these steps but has not said 
when 
there was no immediate comment on todays anc statement from de 
klerks office in south africa 
anc leader nelson mandela released from prison feb 11 after 27 
years in prison is to visit the ancs exile headquarters in lusaka 
next week probably on tuesday 
it was not clear whether the delegation of anc exiles would go 
to south africa before or after the mandela visit 
nzo said that walter sisulu released in october after more than 
25 years in prison would lead the effort to rebuild the anc in 
south africa 
it is important immediately to begin the work of 
reestablishing the anc within the country nzo said adding that 
the organizations estimated 15000 exiles would soon begin to 
return on a large scale 
nzo said the anc resolved to meet mr de klerk as soon as 
possible to discuss with him the need to address these issues so 
that a climate conducive to negotiations is created 
the guerrilla movement said the delegation would include exiled 
members as well as leaders inside south africa that could include 
mandela and sisulu although nzo did not specify anyone by name 
the anc the main black group fighting white rule in south 
africa has been waging a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 
however the armed struggle has been largely dormant in the past 
year and poses no serious threat to the whiteled government 
the announcement followed three days of meetings to evaluate 
recent reforms announced feb 2 by de klerk such as legalizing 
more than 60 opposition groups including the anc the release of 
mandela the easing of press restrictions and a moratorium on 
executions 
nzo said the anc views these reforms in a positive light 
the anc which was banned for 30 years also said it would open 
offices in south africa 
de klerk and his predecessor pw botha met with mandela while 
he was in prison but no south african leader has met with any anc 
leaders as free men 
mandela in an interview today said he would be willing to meet 
with de klerk to discuss the prospect of negotiations 
i have found him to be a man of integrity with whom i can do 
business mandela said 
de klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution that will include 
the 28 million black majority in the national government 
but he opposes a oneman onevote system and outright black 
majority rule the basic demand of all leading antiapartheid 
groups including the anc he envisions some mechanism that will 
give whites veto power on major policy decisions

an architects organization has recommended 
tearing down the earthquakedamaged embarcadero freeway in downtown 
san francisco and replacing it with a waterfront boulevard 
we believe a surface roadway emerges as the better 
alternative said clark manus chairman of the urban design 
committee of san franciscos chapter of the american institute of 
architects 
the chapter released a report thursday which concluded that 
tearing down the 15mile elevated freeway would be safer cheaper 
faster and more compatible with other improvements in the area than 
rebuilding it 
alex bonutti president of the aia san francisco chapter called 
demolition a practical solution which minimizes further 
disruption to the city 
before the oct 17 earthquake the freeway carried 60000 cars a

the national organization for women was 
born in a hotel room in 1965 its name scribbled on a napkin no one 
saved 
loss of any other details about the beginning of now would 
hinder future historians seeking to chart the start of the modern 
battle for womens equality 
to preserve the stories of the women who spearheaded the modern 
womens movement patricia king is coordinating an oral history 
project of now and founder betty friedan 
the 100000 project at the schlesinger library of womens 
history at radcliffe college is being underwritten largely by mary 
jean tully a former president of the now legal defense and 
education fund 
we were creating a revolution a revolution thats changed 
the way people think about women the way they think about men and 
the way they think about each other it also changed the way women 
think about themselves their rights as human beings tully said 
from juno fla where she was vacationing 
i want my granddaughter to be able to study these things i 
want books to be written about it its affected everyones life 
there is little solid documentation of the early years of now 
we were using corporate hotel rooms and xeroxes lots of 
xeroxes but there was very very little written down we thought 
we were changing the world and nobody was taking notes said 
tully the only way we can get any documentation is the memories 
of those of us who were there 
tully is 64 friedan is 69 some of nows earliest movers and 
shakers are now in their 70s the youngest are reaching 50 
the oral history project is expected to take three years and 
include interviews with about 40 people present at the early 
founding and establishment of now it will also contain interviews 
with associates of friedan before and after she wrote the 
feminine mystique the 1963 analysis of women in american society 
an oral history of now also will show the continuity of womens 
history and that the movement was much more than one woman said 
susan ware a historian of 20thcentury us and womens history at 
new york university 
ware said she hopes to find in the firstperson accounts of 
nows story a way to trace the developing feminist agenda and the 
way in which issues like economics and the era the whole 
controversy over abortion how those kinds of issues began to 
develop whether they were divisive how they were mobilized 
the voices of past efforts will have a message for the present 
and the future as well said ware 
anytime you study a feminist organization it forces you to 
look again at all the problems women face in our society ware 
said when you study it you find out how much has changed and 
how much remains 
some say the womens movement grew out of the civil rights 
movement others insist it was really born in the last century with 
the effort that culminated in womens suffrage 
king director of the schlesinger library points out that other 
womens groups preceded now but it was now that galvanized 
feminists moved into the grass roots learned how to use the media 
and continues to thrive as a political voice for women

president bush met with his cabinet today to 
review the the icebreaking drug summit in colombia and to 
discuss the next steps in the international battle against 
narcotics 
bush waved off reporters questions at the outset of the cabinet 
meeting saying weve got a lot of business to do 
the president laughed when asked if he was still upset with 
reporters over stories that suggested he has sometimes misled the 
media he said thursday that such reports might lead him to cut 
back on news conferences but then he held two of them 
im going to get upset if you dont get the hell out of 
here bush said kiddingly as reporters were escorted from the 
cabinet room 
bush was flying to kennebunkport maine later today for a 
threeday holiday weekend at his oceanfront home he returned to 
the white house late thursday night from what he called the 
icebreaking meeting in cartagena that will lead to more 
ambitious international efforts to control drugs 
we in fact created the first antidrug cartel bush 
declared after he and the presidents of colombia bolivia and peru 
signed a communique vowing closer coordination in the war on drugs 
and while the document of cartagena broke no major new 
ground in specifics bush hailed the session as having forged an 
unprecedented alliance against the drug trade 
the president said he hopes to enlist us allies in europe and 
elsewhere in the drug fight and that an international effort 
against drug trafficking will be high on the agenda at the july 
economic summit of major industrial democracies in houston 
ill give a full report to us allies on this 
icebreaking meeting here he said 
the united nations will hold a special session on narcotics 
controls next tuesday through friday secretary of state james a 
baker iii will head the us delegation and speak on tuesday 
afternoon 
the us is hopeful that the special session will result in a 
stronger more balanced multilateral role for the united nations in 
drug control richard boucher a state department spokesman said 
today 
beyond that boucher said the united states hoped the united 
nations will concentrate also in the future on ways to reduce 
demands for narcotics and supplies of illicit drugs as well as 
suppression of drug traffic and improved treatment and 
rehabilitation 
the communique which aides said was written before thursdays 
session calls for a world conference against illicit drug 
trafficking in 1991 and a high level latin american followup 
in six months 
it also commits the bush administration to provide economic aid 
to help the three andean nations wage the drug battle and help 
persuade their farmers to switch to legal crops it calls for 
tougher enforcement of drug laws better exchanges of information 
and increased restrictions on the movement of firearms 
and it asserts that the drug problem is one equally troubling 
to drugproducing nations and drugconsuming ones 
bushs journey to colombia came off without incident amid 
intensive precautions for his safety 
because of security concerns over the safety of the airport at 
cartagena bush flew into and took off from the more secluded 
airport in barranquilla about 60 miles away he flew back and 
forth between barranquilla and cartagena by helicopter 
but bush shrugged off any concern about his own safety 
asked in barranquilla if he was surprised there was no violence 
to protest his visit bush said i am not surprised and he 
complimented colombian and us secret service security details for 
doing a good job 
still william bennett the us drug control policy director 
told reporters on the return flight aboard air force one a lot 
of people told him not to go 
it was risky but itwasnt foolhardy and this is what 
leadership is about bennett added 
the communique spelled out that military force could be used to 
bolster police activity against drug activity but only by each 
nation within its own territorial limits 
that appeared to rule out any andean role for the us military 
such as stationing warships off the coast of colombia 
bush said he didnt raise the idea of using us ships to 
establish a radar net task force to track cocainecarrying 
aircraft 
he said however that he reasserted my intention to interdict 
narcotics coming into this country including action on the high 
seas 
colombian president virgilio barco told a cartagena news 
conference after the drug summit that a us naval presence close 
to the colombian coast was not necessary colombian territorial 
waters are being controlled by us 
bush vowed to work to help open us markets to more andean 
nation products and to seek to ease current trade disputes between 
colombia and the united states over coffee and cut flower pricing 
a key consensus bush said was agreement that growing coca 
for the international drug market is immoral and wrong no 
matter how lucrative to andean farmers 
bush has proposed a 22 billion fiveyear plan for aiding 
andean nations wage the drug battle 
on the return flight to washington a parade of administration 
officials visited the press section of air force one to declare the 
session a success 
this is a real seachange in the international debate about 
drugs said assistant secretary of state bernard aaronson 
bennett declared this day could be the day these things came to 
maturity in the drug battle 
secretary of state james a baker iii also trumpeted the outcome 
of the conference 
earlier thursday bush displayed some testiness in a 
conversation with reporters complaining that some recent news 
stories had made him sound deceptive and secretive he said he 
might hold fewer news conferences so he wouldnt be burned 
he referred to stories noting that on monday he told a news 
conference he did not think it was time for a fourpower conference 
on german reunification on tuesday an agreement was announced 
calling for just such a conference bush said he didnt know about 
the deal at the time of his news conference

noriega in federal prison a visit allowed by the united states 
under its agreement to treat the deposed panamanian leader as a 
prisoner of war 
all details of the visit are kept strictly confidential said 
international committee of the red cross spokeswoman ann stingle in 
washington 
noriega is housed in a special cell at the federal metropolitan

the united states government has granted the necessary 
facilities to carry out their work said jeanmarc bornet the 
chief delegate for latin america from the international committee 
a genevabased organization concerned with prisoners rights 
after examining a prison red cross officials generally conduct 
a private interview with the prisoner 
they ask only about the conditions of detention bornet said 
including subjects such as food exercise family contact and 
medical treatment 
charles davis spokesman for the federal prison confirmed the 
red cross visit but said he could not release any information on 
the delegates activities 
after the visit the team will make a report about noriegas 
conditions at the prison said bornet and that will be sent to the 
governments involved 
bornet said noriegas attorneys have contacted the agency about 
the geneva convention but that the visit was routine under an 
agreement the red cross reached with the us government 
immediately after the dec 20 invasion of panama 
the red cross also is visiting several other panamanian 
prisoners in the united states including noriegas codefendant 
and jailmate luis del cid allegedly once a top aide to the 
deposed leader 
noriegas defense team had demanded he be treated as a pow 
saying us civilian courts had no jurisdiction over him 
the government agreed to the pow treatment but said he could 
still be prosecuted on a 1988 drugtrafficking indictment us 
district judge william hoeveler concurred last week and ordered 
the legal proceedings to continue

drexel burnham lambert inc fired thousands of 
workers today as the former junk bond powerhouse continued 
dismantling as part of the largest bankruptcy filing in securities 
industry history 
there are some tears today we all regard it as a real shame 
and a tragedy said john e oden director of institutional 
placement in drexels real estate division in beverly hills calif 
i feel like it could have been prevented 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said letters of termination were 
sent to the bulk of drexels 5300 workers today the remaining 
employees from investment bankers to secretaries will stay on 
temporarily to finish pending business 
youve got assets here anreder said we still have to 
negotiate try to straighten things out real estate to unload 
the investment firm said it was completing severance packages 
for most of the fired workers which included the 400member 
beverly hills junk bond division 
the operation long headed by michael milken was largely 
responsible for the firms rise from the margins of wall street to 
billiondollar profits and subsequent decline amid crushing 
scandals of the late 1980s 
the highyield bond division was devastated last year by the 
departure of milken after his indictment on fraud and racketeering 
charges and the subsequent collapse of the junk bond market 
as few as 10 to 15 percent of drexels 5300 workers the most 
talented could expect to land jobs perrin long of lipper 
analytical services estimated the securities industry has lost 
35000 people since the october 1987 stock market crash 
this isnt the best of times long said 
drexel employees have been looking for new work since the 
investment banks parent drexel burnham lambert group inc filed 
for chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection tuesday many found 
banks unwilling to accept their last paychecks because of 
uncertainty about whether they would clear the new york times 
reported today 
meanwhile most of drexels multibilliondollar treasury 
securities portfolio was liquidated by thursday aided by a rise in 
bond prices in the past week drexel executives said the firms 
junkbond holdings estimated to be worth about 1 billion were 
being dumped below market value 
there are parts of this business that are still good and 
represent value and those will be disposed of in an orderly way 
said alan miller the bankruptcy lawyer handling the case 
across wall street competing firms picked at drexels carcass 
to evaluate what holdings might be worth taking over soon to be 
exdrexel employees were said to be jobhunting alone and in groups 
of up to 50 people 
sure were looking at their clients they had lots of good 
people working there as well said joel cohen head of mergers 
and acquisitions at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
arthur kirsch chief of drexels worldwide equity business told 
his 600member division he still was trying to arrange for a mass 
movement to another firm 
but employees and analysts were skeptical that would happen to 
drexel divisions which consist of people and contacts not 
products 
i think its a great proposal but nobody will buy it said 
long of lipper analytical services 
lincoln supposedly did away with slavery with the emancipation 
proclamation he said you cant sell people

mayor marion barry vows i will be 
exonerated of new drugrelated charges but a city official is 
calling for his resignation and a top adviser wonders whether the 
mayor has any political future 
barry 53 was indicted thursday on five misdemeanor counts of 
cocaine possession and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury 
questioning him on drug use 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson who was assigned 
the case today tentatively scheduled barrys arraignment for next 
wednesday 
meanwhile close advisers to barry said thursday that the mayor 
will leave a florida drug treatment clinic by the end of the month 
to continue treatment elsewhere barry entered the hanleyhazelden 
clinic in west palm beach four days after his jan 18 arrest on a 
cocaine possession charge in what authorities said was a videotaped 
hotel sting 
the new clinic has not been chosen but an adviser speaking on 
condition of anonymity said a top priority will be to ensure that 
barry is isolated from the media 
barry in a defiant statement issued through his office said 
the indictment was a continuation of the political lynching and 
excesses of the justice department in this multiyear 
multimilliondollar effort to investigate me 
now that we will be moving into the courtroom which is where 
this case should be tried not in the press i am relieved 
barry said i know that when a trial is held i will be 
exonerated 
barry has steadfastly denied ever using drugs and his statement 
said he was undergoing treatment for the disease of alcoholism 
the mayor said he is giving no thought to resigning 
but one aide who asked not to be identified said the 
indictment dealt a crippling blow an absolutely devastating 
assault to barrys reelection chances if he seeks a fourth 
fouryear term in novembers election 
asked if barry should resign city councilwoman betty ann kane 
said it might be in his best interests and the citys best 
interests as a person who cares about the city i would make that 
recommendation now that its gotten to this point 
the washington post said in editorial today that barry has 
lost any last claim to a position of leadership and should resign 
for the sake of the city and of all the talent that stands 
ready to enlist public support for new leadership in city hall 
mr barry should let go entirely the newspaper said 
under city law barry would be forced to resign if convicted of 
a felony and city council chairman david clarke would become 
acting mayor 
each of the three perjury charges stemming from barrys 
association with convicted drug dealer charles lewis carries a 
fiveyear maximum prison term and a maximum fine of 250000 
each cocaine possession charge four stemming from barrys 
visits to lewis hotel room in december 1988 and one from an fbi 
sting operation that resulted in his january arrest carries a 
maximum sentence of one year in a jail and a fine of 100000 
only one of the possession charges stems from the videotaped 
hotel room encounter between barry and rasheeda moore a onetime 
barry girlfriend who is cooperating with investigators 
us attorney jay b stephens said of the perjury charges mr 
barry falsely testified that he was unaware of any narcotics 
activity by mr charles lewis when he stated that mr lewis had 
never given him mr barry any narcotics and when he stated that 
he mr barry had never given any narcotics to mr lewis 
barry told aides privately on the weekend following his arrest 
that he would abandon plans for a fourth term but he has not yet 
made any public statement to that effect 
stuart j long barrys financial cochairman said the mayor 
would face an uphill battle if he decided to run again hes got 
the trial probably a oneweek thing up or down long said 
after that well who knows 
four candidates including clarke already have announced their 
candidacies jesse l jackson has refused to rule out a campaign if 
barry is not in the race 
meanwhile law enforcement sources said two witnesses both 
social companions of the mayor were called to the federal 
courthouse under subpoena but left without testifying just before 
the indictments were issued 
sources said the witnesses gaylord tissueboo and former 
birmingham ala official willie davis were expected to be asked 
whether they had ever seen barry use drugs or if they had provided 
drugs to him 
it was not clear whether they or other witnesses would later be 
called before the grand jury which is empaneled until june the 
sources said 
the federal probe of barry began in december 1988 after city 
police aborted an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from lewis 
when they discovered that the mayor was in lewis hotel room 
lewis who pleaded guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges in 
november testified in court that he had supplied barry with 
cocaine lewis who has cooperated with prosecutors investigating 
his relationship with the mayor has been convicted of selling 
crack cocaine to undercover fbi agents in his native virgin islands

it was no mystery when janet jacksons rhythm 
nation 1814 went platinum but that number in the title is a 
mystery to many fans 
its true that r is the 18th letter in the alphabet and n is 
the 14th but thats just coincidence jackson said in the march 5 
issue of us magazine 
what actually happened jackson said was that while 
writing rhythm nation i was kidding around saying god you 
guys i feel like this could be the national anthem for the 90s 
just by a crazy chance we decided to look up when francis 
scott key wrote the national anthem and it was september 14 
1814 
jackson said that when she told aampm records executives what it 
meant they didnt want me to say so i didnt they still dont 
want me to say but everyone keeps asking me

african national congress leader 
nelson mandela said friday he is ready to meet president fw de 
klerk to try to launch talks on resolving south africas racial 
conflict 
mandela made the comment as the african national congress 
announced in lusaka zambia that it would send a delegation to meet 
de klerk to prepare for negotiations on ending whiteminority rule 
and sharing power with blacks 
mandela said he was ready to play a role in talks on a new 
political structure including meeting with de klerk he said he 
did not know when such talks might take place and he would have to 
consult with the anc leadership 
they the anc might want me to meet mr de klerk and convey 
certain messages this will be decided by them he said 
mandela who was released from jail feb 11 after 27 years in 
jail plans to visit lusaka probably next week for talks with the 
ancs exiled leaders mandelas role in the anc is yet to be 
determined but he is regarded as the most popular and important 
black leader in south africa 
he said the anc still wants de klerk to meet its conditions for 
talks including releasing all political prisoners and ending a 
state of emergency de klerk who legalized the anc and other 
opposition groups feb 2 has said only political prisoners not 
guilty of violent crimes would be released 
mandela said he believed the anc and the government could make 
rapid progress we have made it easy for him de klerk that an 
agreement should be reached as soon possible as far as we are 
concerned we are fully prepared to cooperate in easing problems 
with him 
mandela met earlier friday with diplomatic representatives of 
about 20 nations including the united states he outlined his 
hopes for south africa during the closeddoor meeting and urged 
other nations to help end apartheid 
talking to reporters at his home mandela was questioned about 
the many invitations he has received from world leaders to visit 
their countries president bush has invited mandela to washington 
the chance to meet bush was an honor and an opportunity 
which would be very important to any people who are struggling 
for change in their own country he said but a decision whether 
to accept such an invitation would have to come from the national 
executive committee of the anc he said 
mandela said he was not worried about opposition from rightwing 
whites to attempts to end whiteminority rule although they might 
pose a threat to his personal safety he dismissed the white 
opposition conservative party saying it had no policy at all 
except to appeal to rabid racialism 
thousands of whites protesting de klerks overtures to the black 
majority marched through pretoria ton hursday night in a major show 
of strength to demand new elections police said today that up to 
40000 whites took part in the march 
de klerks decision to free mandela and legalize the anc had 
created fear and uncertainty among south african whites the party 
said in a statement in its newspaper die patriot 
with one stroke great uncertainty about the future has been 
created the voters have been lied to too often the statement 
said

the african national congress said friday 
it is now willing to meet with south african president fw de 
klerk to discuss opening talks on ending the groups threedecade 
guerrilla war against apartheid 
such a meeting would be the first between the guerrilla 
movements exiled leaders and a south african head of state it 
could represent a major step toward finding a solution to south 
africas blackwhite divisions 
the group also said thousands of black guerrillas exiled decades 
ago would be returning to their homeland as the onceoutlawed group 
moves back to south africa 
the ancs national executive committee said delegates would 
visit south africa to try to clear the way for negotiations on 
ending whiteminority rule and sharing power with blacks for the 
first time the anc gave no date for the visit 
the offer follows the governments historic release on sunday of 
nelson mandela the most famous symbol of antiapartheid 
resistance mandela was freed to a tumultuous welcome after 27 
years in prison 
alfred nzo secretarygeneral of the anc also said the 
guerrilla movement was prepared to negotiate a suspension of 
hostilities once de klerk meets the groups remaining conditions 
for formal talks 
to achieve this objective in the shortest possible time the 
national executive committee resolved to meet mr de klerk as soon 
as possible the antiapartheid group said 
the groups conditions for formal talks are a lifting of the 
state of emergency and the release of all political prisoners 
a south african government spokesman said his administration was 
waiting to see the anc statement and would have no immediate 
response but it was unlikely that de klerk would refuse such a 
meeting 
the anc the main black group fighting white rule in south 
africa has been waging a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 
however the armed struggle has been largely dormant in the past 
year and poses no serious threat to the whiteled government 
mandela said friday he was ready to meet with de klerk to 
further negotiations and end apartheid mandela released sunday 
after 27 years in jail is expected to visit lusaka next week to 
consult with the exiled leadership 
i have found him de klerk to be a man of integrity with whom 
i can do business mandela said at his home in soweto outside 
johannesburg 
the anc said de klerk still had not met all conditions to clear 
the way for talks on creating a new political structure for south 
africa and cited the 3yearold state of emergency 
the statement also called for an end to all political trials and 
army troops be removed from black townships 
nzo said the anc resolved to meet mr de klerk as soon as 
possible to discuss with him the need to address these issues so 
that a climate conducive to negotiations is created 
the meeting agreed that the pretoria regime had not yet 
created a climate conducive for negotiations nzo said 
nzo said that walter sisulu released in october after more than 
25 years in prison would lead the effort to rebuild the anc in 
south africa 
it is important immediately to begin the work of 
reestablishing the anc within the country nzo said 
he said the organizations estimated 15000 exiles would soon 
begin to return on a large scale 
the guerrilla movement said the delegation would include exiled 
members as well as leaders inside south africa that could include 
mandela and sisulu although nzo did not specify anyone by name 
the ancs statement followed three days of meetings to evaluate 
recent reforms announced feb 2 by de klerk such as legalizing 
more than 60 opposition groups including the anc the release of 
mandela the easing of press restrictions and a moratorium on 
executions 
nzo said the anc views these reforms in a positive light 
the anc which was banned for 30 years also said it would open 
offices in south africa 
de klerk and his predecessor pw botha met with mandela while 
he was in prison however no south african leader has met with any 
anc leaders as free men 
de klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution that will include 
the 28 million black majority in the national government 
but he opposes a oneman onevote system and outright black 
majority rule the basic demand of all leading antiapartheid 
groups including the anc he envisions some mechanism that will 
give whites veto power on major policy decisions

the chief mate of the exxon valdez said 
today that in the first minutes after the tanker went aground he 
thought the skipper was trying to move the ship off a reef but 
later decided to keep it stable 
james kunkel concluding his testimony in joseph hazelwoods 
criminal trial said the captain of the tanker never told him 
whether or not he was trying to slide the ship off the jagged reef 
a move prosecutors say could have caused it to capsize and sink 
jurors already had heard a tape recording of conversations 
between hazelwood and the coast guard on march 24 after the 
nations worst oil spill indicating hazelwood tried to move the 
grounded ship 
kunkel testified that his first report to the skipper upon 
checking computer readings after the disaster was that the ship 
was stable 
on the basis of the instructions and commands the captain was 
giving you did you believe the captain was trying to keep the 
vessel on the reef asked hazelwood lawyer michael chalos 
at that time no i did not kunkel said i felt that 
perhaps we were trying to get off the reef at the beginning 
minutes later he said hazelwood told him to ballast the ship 
down and it was clear he was trying to stay on the rocks 
we are working our way off the reef hazelwood was heard 
saying in a radio message minutes after the tanker was gashed open 
and began spilling oil into prince william sound 
the port commander warned hazelwood against doing anything 
drastic and suggested i wouldnt do much wiggling 
the prosecution hopes to establish that hazelwoods effort to 
extricate the ship demonstrates his recklessness which must be 
proved for a conviction on the felony charge and one of three 
misdemeanor counts that hazelwood faces defense attorneys say 
hazelwoods orders were aimed at stabilizing the tanker on the reef 
the coast guard tape played in a hushed courtroom began with 
routine inquiries from hazelwood about ice conditions and his 
report that he planned to divert around shipping lanes to avoid 
ice shortly after midnight hazelwood called the vessel traffic 
center again 
his voice was gravelly and he sighed as he said its valdez 
back we should be on your radar weve fetched up hard aground 
evidently were leaking some oil and were going to be here for 
awhile 
within minutes the captain of the port coast guard cmdr 
steven mccall called hazelwood asking for more information 
a little problem here with the third mate but we are working 
our way off the reef hazelwood said the vessels been holed 
right now were trying just to get her off the reef and well 
get back to you as soon as we can 
the third mate gregory cousins was in control when the ship 
grounded he has blamed the accident on the helmsmans inability to 
take steering orders 
kunkel testified thursday the skipper had a calming influence on 
the crew in the wake of the accident 
what was the captains demeanor asked hazelwood lawyer 
michael chalos 
very sullen but all business said kunkel cool calm in 
charge 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with 
seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of reckless 
endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel 
while intoxicated if convicted he could draw up to 7 years in 
prison and 61000 in fines 
kunkel in charge of loading the ships cargo of oil said he 
rushed to the cargo room after the grounding and saw the oil gauges 
dropping he said he programmed the ships computer with facts 
about the grounding and it told him the ship could not go out 
onto a seaway he said he relayed this to hazelwood 
kunkel said he had warned hazelwood earlier that the helmsman 
robert kagan needed practice in steering and required special 
supervision in even the simplest tasks 
kunkel said he sailed with kagan four years earlier and wrote an 
evaluation saying the seaman tended to drift off while steering 
he said he once assigned kagan a simple task painting a bulkhead 
but found he had to watch him to ensure he used the right paint and 
brush 
but kunkel said he had no doubt that kagan was capable of 
executing a 10 degree right rudder turn which cousins has said

sam nujoma a former guerrilla leader 
who spent 30 years in exile was elected namibias first president 
friday and will take office when the territory wins independence 
from south africa on march 21 
nujoma helped found the southwest africa peoples organization 
in 1960 and led it through a 23year bush war against south african 
rule of namibia africas last colony 
on behalf of the namibian people and myself i want to express 
my sincere appreciation for the trust and honor you have bestowed 
upon me he told the 72member constituent assembly after its 
unanimous vote 
i call on all namibians to remain united behind our government 
and work together for peace and stability he said 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will swear nujoma 
into office on namibias independence day namibias south african 
administrator louis pienaar will remain in charge of the 
territory until then 
more than 20 heads of state are expected to attend the 
independence ceremonies swapo leaders say they will invite both 
south african president fw de klerk and recently released african 
national congress leader nelson mandela 
nujoma will serve five years then will be eligible for a second 
term however the constitution limits a president to two fiveyear 
terms a rarity on a continent where most leaders serve for life 
south africa which has ruled namibia since 1915 agreed to 
grant the territory independence under a regional peace accord 
signed in 1988 with angola and cuba 
more than 6000 un military and civilian personnel have been 
monitoring the transition to independence which began in april 
the rev jesse jackson attended the assembly session friday and 
was allowed to speak to its members 
im impressed by people civilized enough to agree and 
disagree jackson told the assembly this is an example of how 
a democratic society can work when people move from polarization to 
coalition 
jackson a former us presidential candidate completed an 
eightday visit to south africa on thursday and said namibia could 
become a shining example of democracy for south africa 
jackson who has known nujoma for many years told the namibian 
leader that god has rewarded you for all your suffering 
jackson said he would urge the us government to increase aid 
to namibia and other blackruled countries in the region 
leftist swapo won 41 of the assembly seats in elections last 
november six other parties captured the remaining 31 spots 
despite a hardfought election and sharp ideological 
differences the parties quickly worked out a democratic 
westernstyle constitution that was unamimously approved earlier 
this month also nujoma has named whites businessmen and 
opposition party members to his cabinet in a bid to heal the deep 
divisions caused by a war that lasted from 1966 until april 1989 
nujoma 60 has little formal education but is considered a 
shrewd instinctive politician who has maintained leadership of his 
organization despite several challenges over the years 
he helped found the ovamboland peoples organization the 
forerunner to swapo in the late 1950s he went into exile in 1959 
and was named president of newly formed swapo in 1960 
under his leadership the movement was recognized by the united 
nations as the sole and authentic representative of the namibian 
people although the territory had dozens of political parties 
nujoma helped launch swapos guerrilla war in 1966 and traveled 
widely during his years in exile particularly to communist and 
third world countries 
in exile he generally was portrayed as a marxist but has 
sounded much more moderate since returning to namibia in september 
even his political opponents have praised his efforts at 
reconciliation and the transition to independence has gone much 
more smoothly than most observers expected

the soviet union agreed to letting the united 
states have more troops in europe because it expects events to make 
irrelevant within a year or two the newly agreedupon ceilings 
soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov said friday 
we want to lower the level of military confrontation in 
europe said gerasimov a spokesman of the soviet foreign 
ministry in a telephone interview on national public radios 
morning edition 
we want it to be zero confrontation and we want foreign 
troops to be removed from foreign soil everywhere he said 
gerasimov said the soviets didnt accept the us argument that 
the united states needs to have 30000 more troops in europe than 
the soviets because of the difficulty in moving forces across the 
atlantic in the event of a conflict 
but the soviets decided to accept president bushs proposal for 
195000 troops for each superpower in central europe with an 
additional 30000 americans allowed elsewhere in europe to clear 
the way for a europewide treaty on cutting conventional forces 
gerasimov said 
the political situation in europe is changing at such a pace 
that a year or two from now these figures of 195000 and 30 
additional thousand will become irrelevant he said this is my 
hope 
so not to stop this process with small obstacles we decided to 
make this concession to common sense gerasimov said if 
you want to keep additional troops its your taxpayers money 
he said he had been reading remarks by french president francois 
mitterrand that alliances can exist only if they have enemies 
suggesting that the warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty 
organization may fade away 
today nobody in his right mind can argue that the soviets want 
to attack western europe said gerasimov and i hope that 
nobody in western europe or in your country thinks in terms of 
attacking eastern europe or the soviet union 
military capability must be cut to be in line with the good 
intentions of both sides because intentions may be changed 
tomorrow he said 
the soviet union continues to oppose us demands that a 
reunified germany remain a member of nato but the diminished 
importance of the alliances could make the issue irrelevant 
gerasimov said

a court on friday ordered eurotunnel to pay 
contractors 114 million for their work on a rail tunnel under the 
english channel 
the commercial tribunal of nanterre in suburban paris made the 
ruling on behalf of transmanche link tml the consortium of 
contractors working on the project 
the decision follows a series of conflicts between the parent 
company and the anglofrench consortium a eurotunnel spokeswoman 
said the company will appeal 
the dispute stems from tmls refusal to sign a financing 
agreement with eurotunnel and creditors allowing eurotunnel to draw 
701 million from the 87 billion in new loans granted to the 
venture 
the eurotunnel spokeswoman said the company lacks the funds to 
pay tml because the consortium refuses to sign the agreement and 
free up new loans 
disagreements between tml and eurotunnel have centered on the 
appointment of alistair morton former british president of the 
parent company as the new chief executive 
eurotunnel stock fell 60 cents per share to 939 on friday with 
19 million shares changing hands 
the tunnel being built from both sides is due to be opened in 
mid1993 to rail traffic about a third of the 34mile project is 
complete

soviet human rights activist yelena bonner 
said today that president mikhail s gorbachev deserves praise for 
his foreign policy but gets too much credit for changes taking 
place in the soviet union 
we do not know what it is he wants bonner said at the 
opening of a forum on human rights is he only interested in 
personal power or he is interested in the rights of the people 
bonner appeared at the peace prize forum at augsburg college in 
place of her husband nobel peace prize winner andrei sakharov who 
had been scheduled to address the forum before his death in 
december 
she said gorbachevs actions in allowing changes in the soviet 
bloc are widely misinterpreted by western countries she said 
revolts have been brewing for a long time and gorbachev deserves 
credit only for not stamping them out 
bonner said the soviet communist partys platform issued three 
days ago has only slight changes from party platforms of past 
decades 
she also said gorbachevs initiatives in making elections more 
democratic came too late because the changes were made after the 
deadline for filing for office had closed the elections scheduled 
in march in the soviet union are extremely important she said 
if he would have done this six months ago it would have been 
a courageous act bonner said but now so what 
she also said people in the soviet union are afraid gorbachev is 
claiming too many powers 
gorbachev has shown himself as a very strong leader in the 
struggle for his own power and his own survival she said 
bonner also criticized gorbachev for using military force to 
handle demonstrations and other disruptions 
the analysis of the western media stops at poor gorbachev 
how difficult it must be for him to govern in such 
circumstances she said 
bonner opened the forum with a news conference also attended by 
former vice president walter mondale her remarks in russian were 
interpreted in english by her son 
the theme of the peace prize forum is human rights in the 
global village it is sponsored by five colleges of the 
evangelical lutheran church in america including augsburg and is 
being held in conjunction with the oslobased norwegian nobel 
institute which awards the nobel peace prize 
sakharov won the nobel peace prize in 1975 for leading the human 
rights movement in the soviet union for decades

a mass of molasses oozed through two 
blocks of colorados sweetheart city on friday after a storage 
tank ruptured forcing a kindergarten to close and blocking several 
businesses 
no one was injured but before the syrupy mess was identified 
authorities took precautions against what they thought was a 
potentially dangerous chemical spill 
word of the spill reached authorities early friday after a car 
spun out of control on a slippery substance and ran into a ditch 
city manager mike rock said two young males were in the vehicle 
and one of them told me it was like hitting glare ice his 
windshield was so splattered with the stuff he couldnt see 
the molasses was steaming when it escaped but it thickened in 
the 5 degrees below zero temperature it flowed down a busy street 
into an industrial park and on into an irrigation ditch where it 
ran for another halfmile said police cpl al sharon 
it gives a whole new meaning to the term sweetheart city 
sharon said 
sharon estimated the ruptured tank was three stories high and 30 
to 50 feet in diameter 
jack fulton director of government relations for western sugar 
co owner of the molasses said 3400 tons or about 618000 
gallons were in the tank leased from great western salvage co 
we have engineers on the scene trying to determine the best 
way to clean up the spill fulton said 
the molasses is used as an animalfeed supplement often added 
to barley or other grains 
traffic was directed away from madison avenue which was covered 
with 1 to 7 inches of sticky brownishblack goo 
rock said of the cleanup effort maybe we need to bring in a 
big bunch of pancakes 
this city of approximately 30000 people 53 miles north of 
denver postmarks special valentines greetings on thousands of 
envelopes each year at this time 
the kindergarten and businesses in the industrial park were 
closed because their entrances were blocked by the running mass

a us commission on aviation security and 
terrorism appointed after the flight 103 disaster said friday that 
airport security has improved in europe but africa is a basket 
case 
if there is an achilles heel in aviation security it is 
africa which is literally a basket case said us rep james l 
oberstar chairman of the house public works and transportation 
subcommittee on aviation 
oberstar said cited poor training for security personnel high 
staff turnover insufficient detection equipment and economic 
pressures on african governments 
oberstar a minnesota democrat was speaking at a news 
conference given by the commission near the end of a week of 
consultations with airline government and security officials in 
west germany france and britain 
the commission is to report in may to president bush on american 
policy toward the terrorist threat to civil aircraft and to make 
safety recommendations 
bush appointed the sevenmember commission after pan am flight 
103 from frankfurt to new york via london was blown up by a 
terrorist bomb over the scottish town of lockerbie on dec 21 
1988 all 259 people aboard the boeing 747 and 11 people on the 
ground were killed 
oberstar said the attitude of france toward the terrorist threat 
to aircraft had changed markedly since sept 19 when a dc10 of 
the french airline uta crashed in niger west africa killing all 
171 passengers and crew uta said the apparent cause was a bomb 
the attitude in france a year ago was this is an american 
problem said oberstar after uta the french attitude is it 
is a worldwide problem 
the french government has given more than 5 million to african 
countries to train airport security personnel since the uta 
disaster the commissioners said 
they added that the attitude toward air security generally was 
tougher in europe than a year ago west germany for example 
markedly improved its system of checking baggage and passengers 
the fact is right now i think we are improving said 
commission leader ann mclaughlin a former us labor secretary 
commissioner member sen alfonse m damato rnew york said no 
one still knew for sure where the radiocassette bomb was put 
aboard flight 103 british officials maintain it was in frankfurt 
west german police seized similar bombs in october 1988 and 
arrested 16 palestinians but soon released all but two of them 
including a jordanian suspected by some of assembling the bomb in 
frankfurt that blew up the pan am flight 
the commission members will spend the day in lockerbie on sunday 
before going home

a surprisingly large 30 percent tradebalance 
improvement in december allowed the nation to close out 1989 with a 
1086 billion deficit the smallest in five years the government 
said friday 
while conceding that most of the december improvement was 
dependent on special factors the bush administration hailed the 
84 percent narrowing in the deficit for the year as evidence that 
the administrations effort to open foreign markets was succeeding 
however private economists were not as enthusiastic pointing 
out that while us exports hit an alltime high last year so did 
imports driven upward by americas growing dependence on foreign 
oil 
some economists forecast that the deficit this year will resume 
worsening as consumers continue their love affair with imported 
products and the foreign oil bill rises 
but other economists were not as pessimistic believing that 
1990 would show another slight improvement in the deficit although 
probably not enough to dampen protectionist cries in congress 
the trade deficit is coming out of a sixmonth period of 
deterioration but what happened in december overstates whatever 
improvement is occurring said allen sinai chief economist of 
the boston co 
in other economic news the government said that industrial 
production fell 12 percent in january pushing the operating rate 
at the countrys factories mines and utilities down to 819 
percent almost 25 percentage points below where it was a year ago 
while much of the january drop was a factor of unseasonably warm 
weather reducing the need for utility production analysts said 
much of american industry particularly automaking remains in a 
slump 
the 1989 trade deficit followed a 1185 billion deficit in 1988 
and was the smallest since a 1067 billion deficit in 1984 
however it still represented the sixth consecutive year that the 
difference between imports and exports remained above 100 billion 
many econmists believe the huge trade deficits are symbolic of 
americas inability to compete internationally but the bush 
administration maintains that after hitting a record high of 1521 
billion in 1987 the past two years of trade improvements showed 
that the country was regaining many of its lost overseas markets 
commerce undersecretary michael darby noted that us exports 
climbed by 13 percent last year to an alltime high of 3643 
billion while imports were up 73 percent to 4729 billion also 
a record high 
growth in exports was strong across most categories of goods 
including a wide variety of manufactured goods especially 
machinery and telecommunications equipment darby said 
however the export increase was just half the 26 percent rise 
enjoyed during 1988 a year when american manufacturers benefited 
from a falling dollar that made their goods more competitive on 
overseas markets 
while economists at drimcgraw hill forecast that the trade 
deficit will climb to 123 billion this year other analysts 
forecast it would dip to just under 100 billion reflecting their 
belief that strong growth overseas would provide markets for 
american products helping to offset the negative impact of higher 
oil imports 
in 1989 oil imports surged by 272 percent to 4894 billion 
105 billion more than in 1988 it was the highest yearly total 
since a 524 billion foreign oil bill in 1984 
the american petroleum institute said thursday that imports hit 
a record 54 percent of total us demand during january while 
domestic production was falling to its lowest level in a 
quartercentury 
petroleum must become the principal issue in the trade debate 
we are becoming very dependent again on imported petroleum said 
barry rogstad president of the american business conference a 
coalition of fastgrowing mediumsized companies 
as usual the countrys largest imbalance in 1989 was with 
japan a 49 billion deficit that accounted for 45 percent of the 
total this was down only slightly from a 518 billion deficit in 
1988 with japan but some economists noted as encouraging the fact 
that us export sales to japan were up by 182 percent helping to 
offset a 45 percent rise in japanese imports 
the united states enjoyed a rare surplus of 15 billion with 
the 12nation european community a sharp turnaround from a 92 
billion deficit in 1988 
after japan the largest deficits occurred with taiwan 13 
billion canada 962 billion south korea 626 billion and 
china 618 billion one of the biggest surpluses was with the 
soviet union with us exports exceeding soviet imports by 357 
billion 
the december deficit of 717 billion was the lowest monthly 
imbalance since a 679 billion deficit in december 1984 
the 30 percent improvement from novembers 1029 billion 
deficit occurred because exports rose 24 percent to 3111 
billion the secondhighest level on record while imports fell 59 
percent to 3828 billion 
exports were up in december in large part because of a big jump 
in sales of aircraft and parts reflecting the end of the boeing 
strike there were smaller increases in office equipment artwork 
and antiques and industrial machinery

soviet legislators said a bill legalizing private 
property was too vague and sent it back to committee friday then 
took up legislation that would let invididuals own land 
legalizing two fundamentals of capitalism banned for generations 
in this communist state is intended help revive the moribund 
economy by spurring individual initiative and attracting foreign 
investment 
alexander nikonov president of the allunion agricultural 
academy told the supreme soviet legislature the proposed law on 
land gives farmers a voice in choosing the appropriate form of 
ownership and how to use profits from their harvests 
agricultural land now is distributed among state and collective 
farms the constitution which must be changed if the bills become 
law says the land its minerals waters and forests are the 
exclusive property of the state 
debate on the land bill is to continue next week 
the deputies decided to consider the separate private property 
bill again in a week after the committee work and vote separately 
on each of its 35 provisions 
that law would legalize ownership of means of production 
but it does not define the term and says even foreign companies 
once scorned as agents of imperialism may own factories and 
buildings 
legislator vladimir tikhonov an agricultural scientist 
complained that while the draft property law mentioned the right 
to own property nothing in it required the often recalcitrant 
soviet bureaucracy to sell property 
other deputies in the second day of debate on the property 
bill said it was not clear 
everything in the draft law has two meanings said anatoly 
sobchak a prominent reformist from leningrad he said the law must 
say private ownership of any form of property is legal 
in an appeal thursday for approval of the property bill justice 
minister veniamin f takovlev said if we want to have a market 
economy and take part in the international marketplace then we 
need such a law 
president mikhail s gorbachevs five years as soviet leader 
have brought many upheavals in politics and society but few 
official proposals have the breadth of those on property and land 
citizens who were taught for generations that property is 
theft now are being asked to accept private ownership along with 
ownership by collectives and the state 
in other action 100 deputies said they had formed a 
parliamentary faction called soyuz russian for union to resist 
the breakup of the ussr 
they appear to be opposing baltic representatives who seek 
independence for their republics and the interregional group an 
alliance of boris n yeltsin and others who demand radical economic 
and political reform

most states are going along with an experiment 
to waive family income rules so people receiving food stamps can 
work on the 1990 census without losing their monthly benefits the 
agriculture department said friday 
assistant secretary catherine bertini who oversees usda food 
and consumer services said the program will enable participating 
families some extra income and provide the census bureau with 
muchneeded temporary assistance 
the bureau expects to hire about 300000 temporary workers to 
help with the count which is conducted every 10 years pay will 
range from 450 to 9 per hour depending on the region and type 
of work 
normally additional income would lead to a reduction in food 
stamp benefits which are based on household size income assets 
and other factors 
so far all but seven states alabama connecticut florida 
georgia idaho kansas and new hampshire have indicated they 
would participate bertini said 
the family support administration of the department of health 
and human services will conduct a similar demonstration project 
using waivers for recipients of aid to families with dependent 
children afdc the announcement said

the federal election commission said friday it 
wont appeal a judges ruling that it improperly dismissed a 
complaint alleging a republican party fundraising group illegally 
funneled more than 2 million to 1986 senate candidates 
that means the fec accepts the judges order to reconsider the 
complaint an action that could result in a hefty fine against the 
national republican senatorial committee 
us district judge gerhard a gesell ruling jan 24 on a 
lawsuit filed by common cause said the fecs initial refusal to 
act on the complaint cannot be upheld because it ignored the 
plain language of the applicable regulation and was not rationally 
explained 
the commissions only alternative to reconsidering was to 
appeal which fec spokeswoman sharon snyder said the commissioners 
decided not to do 
this action involved very serious violations of the law and 
now the commission has to go back and determine what the proper 
penalties are said common cause president fred wertheimer 
common cause alleged that the nrsc violated contribution limits 
by illegally funnelling proceeds of a fundraising campaign to 12 
republican senate candidates 
the nrsc through letters signed by thenvice president bush 
raised about 28 million and gave it to the candidates all of 
whom ultimatelty lost as the democrats regained control of the 
senate no candidates were identified in the various versions of 
the letters 
by the time of the fundraising campaign the republican party 
already had made the maximum contribution it was allowed to make to 
each senate candidate common cause complained to the fec saying 
the nrsc had pushed the party over the limits by giving the 
proceeds of the letterwriting campaign to the candidates 
the nrsc contended the donations could be treated as individual 
donations to the candidates but common cause noted the checks were 
made out to the nrsc and its affiliates 
the fecs general counsel agreed with common cause and estimated 
the excess contributions totaled 32 million but on a 33 vote 
with the three republican fec appointees siding with the nrsc the 
commission blocked action on a key portion of the complaint 
reducing the amount of excess contributions to 534249 the nrsc 
paid 20000 to settle that portion of the case 
common cause challenged the refusal of the fec to act on the 
major portion arguing the donations were clear violations of the 
party spending caps and gesell agreed 
the decision of the fec not to enforce in the circumstances 
presented by the record was contrary to the intent of congress to 
limit the participating of national parties in campaign 
fundraising gesell wrote

an arizona businessman charged 
with trying to steal a 37ton meteorite from a small argentine town 
left for home friday after a judge ordered a 90day postponement of 
his trial 
ive got my passport and im out of here robert haag 33 
of tucson said in a telephone interview a few hours before 
departure 
im supposed to come back in 90 days said haag also known 
as the meteorite man id like to come back and clear myself but 
i just dont know right now all i want to do is get back to my 
business of selling meteorites 
haag tucson photographer jeffrey smith 31 and miguel 
fernandez an argentine were arrested jan 21 when they were 
stopped by police near the small town of gancedo in chaco 
province 620 miles northwest of buenos aires 
the three defendants were charged in the neighboring town of 
charata with the theft of the meteorite roughly the size of a 
small automobile that police said they found in the back of a 
tractortrailer the men were driving 
the meteorite found in the 1960s reputedly is one of the 
worlds four largest charges against smith were dropped and he 
returned to tucson 
the area is rich in meteorites and several years ago provincial

unauthorized sale 
haag was released on 20000 bond but was forbidden to leave 
argentina 
fernandez unable to post 8600 bond remains in custody in 
charata 
haag claimed he planned to purchase the meteorite in a deal 
arranged by fernandez with the owner of the land on which the 
object had been found

expedition 
this has been a super adventure he said i met a lot of 
people in the chaco and at the end all kinds of them were trying 
to sell me meteorites 
haags case was being heard in charata by judge juan carlos 
clauter the judge postponed the trial and returned haags passport 
on wednesday after haag said he needed to return home to take care 
of business 
im losing at least 2000 a day by being here said haag 
who claims to do half a million dollars of business a year 
selling meteorites to private collectors schools and museums 
haag known to mineral enthusiasts back home as the meteorite 
man said he planned to sell the meteorite he is accused of trying 
to steal i could have gotten a million dollars for it he said 
if convicted haag could be sentenced to from 30 days to two 
years in jail if he fails to return when his trial resumes may 13 
he would forfeit his bail 
meteorites are common in the chaco haag said because a long 
time ago a giant asteroid broke into millions of pieces showering 
the area with fragments some the size of marbles and basketballs 
others weighing a ton or more 
the value of meteorites depends on the kind of material they 
contain he said some are fragments of the moon others are 
the heads of comets 
but im through dealing with meteorites in argentina haag 
added the last thing i want to do is to try to get anything out 
of here

a groundbreaking ceremony will be held next 
week for a religious center to replace a controversial convent on 
the grounds of the nazi death camp at auschwitz the world jewish 
congress said friday 
the official announcement of mondays dedication ceremony will 
be made following a meeting that day between polands prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiescki and wjc president edgar bronfman 
the center will be located several hundred yards from the death 
camp site which has been enshrined as a memorial to the hundreds 
of thousands of jews and other victims exterminated by the nazis 
french bishop gaston poulain announced friday a drive to raise 
funds among french catholics for the interfaith center the wjc 
said other european churches will also take part in raising money 
jews viewed the convent which houses 14 carmelite nuns in a 
warehouse used by the nazis to store gas cylinders for the 
auschwitz crematoria as a sacrilege to the memory of their 
brethren 
in 1987 catholic leaders reached agreement with the wjc to move 
the nuns to a new site near auschwitz by february 1989 
but no action was taken until the vatican intervened last year 
after an outcry by the world jewish community the new 
noncommunist government of poland also intervened and the decision 
was made to honor the 1987 agreement 
jewish leaders have given the new government high marks for its 
commitment to fight antisemitism in poland where only a few 
thousand jews remain from a prewar community of about 35 million

western officials on friday considered 
pleas for cash and credit from five east european countries that 
shed communist rule and now want to embrace freemarket economies 
the representatives of 24 western nations took no immediate 
action on the litany of requests leaving it up to a meeting in 
early june of foreign ministers 
east germany czechoslovakia bulgaria yugoslavia and romania 
are seeking the same sort of western assistance that was given to 
poland and hungary two nations that led the remarkable string of 
anticommunist revolts last year 
though taking no concrete action the western officials said 
they confirmed their readiness to coordinate assistance to the 
five nations 
they expressed their encouragement and their support for the 
measures already taken or envisaged by each of these countries a 
statement said 
it said the european community which is coordinating western 
assistance would send factfinding teams to the countries to get a 
firsthand look at their needs 
under the aid program poland and hungary have accumulated 
commitments to more than 12 billion in loans and guarantees as 
well as emergency food shipments to poland 
in their appeals the other countries emphasized the ills 
plaguing their economies including high inflation and heavy 
foreign debts some worried that quick economic changes would hurt 
living standards and create social tensions 
they all promised to move toward open political systems and 
change their economies from centrally planned systems to the 
freemarket models practiced in the west 
romania which overthrew dictator nicolae ceaucescu complained 
its economy was in deep crisis and suffered the effects of 
economic megalomania poor investments a sharp reduction in 
agricultural production and an inhuman policy toward the people 
bulgaria complained it was burdened by a budget deficit weighty 
foreign debt and an economic structure that favors production of 
heavy goods over consumer products 
efforts to change the economy it said will expose 
individuals to a high economic risk which they might not be able 
to bear 
czechoslovakia said there is no unemployment in 
czechoslovakia however a considerable part of the labor force is 
tied up in inefficient operations 
east germany which has seen thousands of its citizens flow into 
wealthy west germany in recent months said it needed quick reforms 
to gain our peoples confidence in the improvement of their 
economic and living conditions and attract foreign investment 
the countries sent numerous pages of projects they have in mind 
for western assistance ranging from cleaning up the environment to 
upgrading their telecommunications technology 
yugoslavia said it would need 2 billion to rebuild its banking 
system and revamp its economy 
the aid effort began when western leaders in july put the 
european community in charge of fashioning aid packages for poland 
and hungary 
the soviet union has not been invited to take part in the 
program its economic woes greatly overshadow those of its 
neighbors 
nations attending the meeting included the common market 
countries of britain ireland norway denmark belgium the 
netherlands luxembourg germany france spain italy and portugal 
also attending were the united states canada australia 
turkey new zealand japan sweden switzerland finland austria 
norway and iceland

except for emergency food and medicine us 
aid to countries in eastern and central europe will be conditioned 
on their adopting westernstyle political and economic systems a 
senior bush administration official said friday 
specifically deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
told an american chamber of commerce forum the countries should 
set up rival political parties and market economies with large 
private sectors 
rejecting the idea of a marshall plan for eastern europe he 
defended the measured approach of the bush administration and urged 
business executives in the audience not to try to make a quick 
buck in the region but to help build a longrange capitalistic 
structure 
first we want progress toward political pluralism based on 
free and fair elections and an end to the monopoly of the 
communist party eagleburger said 
second we want progress toward economic reform based on the 
emergence of a marketoriented economy with a substantial private 
sector 
eagleburger will get a chance next week to push the us policy 
directly with east europeans the state department announced he 
would lead a us delegation to poland hungary austria and 
yugoslavia feb 2027 to gauge political and economic reform 
poland and hungary are the most advanced of the warsaw pact 
allies in moving away from sovietstyle political and economic 
systems 
us aid over three years to poland is 8465 million and to 
hungary 915 million 
austria is a neutral country with a western orientation state 
department spokesman richard boucher said eagleburger will meet 
there with government leaders to get their appraisal of 
developments in the region 
yugoslavia which is not part of the warsaw pact has a moderate 
communist government trying to hold the country together amid 
tensions between diverse nationalities 
eagleburger said eastern europe is emerging from a 40year time 
capsule but he said we must not transfer substantial sums as 
western banks did in the 1970s before implementation of truly 
fundamental marketoriented reforms 
still eagleburger added not all of our assistance will be 
conditional some of it will be available to countries as they need 
it and are able to use it in this category i would place 
emergency and humanitarian aid designed to relieve deprivation and 
give a new government some breathing room

two americans and three employees 
of a west german chemical plant were charged with making and 
selling illegal drugs for distribution in europe and the united 
states officials said friday 
the west germans work for imhausen chemie the west german 
company that was accused in a separate case of helping manufacture 
a libyan plant allegedly intended to produce poisonous gas 
the five were charged with smuggling and selling millions of 
tablets of amphetamines such as a synthetic drug known as 
ecstasy said a statement issued by the offenburg prosecutors 
office 
all five were in investigative custody the statement did not 
identify the suspects and there was no reply at the prosecutors 
office on friday

chemist the statement said one of the three imhausen employees is 
a french citizen and two are west germans 
west germany is seeking the extradition of one of the accused 
americans who is in custody in the united states the other four 
are being held in west germany the statement said 
prosecutors accused imhausen chemie of delivering about 1 
million tons of chemicals needed to produce amphetamines to illegal 
labs in central america between 1986 and 1988 the two americans 
were charged with smuggling the drugs to the united states 
at the end of 1987 the americans allegedly decided to move drug

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is a 
powerhungry politician who has an overblown reputation as a 
reformer soviet dissident yelena bonner said friday at a peace 
forum 
gorbachev has shown himself as a very strong leader in the 
struggle for his own power and his own survival the widow of 
dissident leader andrei sakharov said is he only interested in 
personal power or is he interested in the rights of the people 
bonners remarks opened the peace prize forum at augsburg 
college a twoday event held in cooperation with the norwegian 
nobel institute sakharov recipient of the 1975 nobel peace prize 
had been scheduled to attend the forum but died dec 14 of a heart 
attack 
bonner said gorbachevs actions have been widely misinterpreted 
by the west she said revolts for democratic change in the soviet 
bloc have been brewing for a long time and gorbachev deserves 
credit only for not stamping them out 
he behaves that way not because he wants them to proclaim 
their independence from the communist party but because he could 
not stop it bonner said he had no way of influencing events 
in eastern europe 
despite five years of perestroika the political and economic 
restructuring sought by gorbachev the soviet union is still 
wracked by economic woes that have kept 43 million people in 
poverty bonner said 
ethnic battles and civil unrest have been worsened by military 
intervention directed by gorbachev she said 
the analysis of the western media stops at poor gorbachev 
how difficult it must be for him to govern in such 
circumstances she said 
while gorbachev deserves credit for a progressive foreign 
policy he has not offered solutions to domestic problems bonner 
said 
his fiveyear economic plan is not at all different from a 
long litany of previous fiveyear plans the most recent soviet 
party platform printed in pravda earlier this week also is 
unchanged she said 
although it does include some new slogans in its substance it 
is not very different from previous communist party platforms 
bonner said these thoughts have lost their meaning to the soviet 
people 
bonner who volunteered for the soviet army in world war ii and 
suffered eye damage during battle began voicing dissent in the 
late 1960s when the red army invaded czechoslovakia after marrying 
sakharov in 1971 she was watched by the kgb and harassed for her 
ties to dissident publishers 
in the mid1970s sakharov was arrested and sent to internal 
exile in the city of gorky after criticizing soviet military 
intervention in afghanistan in 1986 gorbachev personally informed 
sakarov and bonner that they were free to live and work in moscow 
bonner 67 opened the forum with a news conference also 
attended by former vice president walter mondale her remarks were 
interpreted by her son alexey 
bonner and former president carter were to address the forum

day six of trump the divorce arrived friday 
with the billionaire developer saying he had no plans to pay 
estranged wife ivana 100 million in a settlement to end their 
marriage 
i dont rule anything out but its highly unlikely there 
will a settlement negotiated beyond an existing prenuptial 
agreement trump told new york newsday the paper had reported a 
day earlier that trump told associates he expected to pay 100 
million to end the case quickly 
its a very simple case its an open and shut case trump 
told the newspaper ill do whatever i have to do but i dont 
see a settlement of this case 
trumps fortune which includes the trump tower the trump plaza 
hotel and casino and the trump shuttle is estimated at 17 
billion the couple has a divorce agreement which was updated four 
times during their nearly 13year marriage it reportedly would 
give ivana 25 million a connecticut estate and custody of their 
three children 
while trump was focusing on the divorce itself media coverage 
was touching on everything but the couples marriage including 
more reports on purported trump girlfriend marla maples among the 
more interesting items friday were 
advice on divorce from roxanne pulitzer you can fight over 
money and everything ese but i hope the children are kept from all 
this she trumpeted in usa today 
word from skater peggy fleming a rumored trump flame that 
she and donald are not buddybuddy i wouldnt even call him a 
close friend said the former olympian 
columnist liz smiths tidbit in the new york daily news that 
trumps father fred told his son if you dont stop what youre 
doing its going to give me a stroke 
a frontpage headline in the new york post proclaiming 
marla boasts to her pals about donald best sex ive ever 
had a picture of a smuglooking trump ran alongside the 
headline with a caption reading we always knew donald trump was 
a tiger in the corporate board room but now we know hes a wildcat 
in the bedroom too 
this last item produced an angry denial from miss maples agent 
chuck jones 
it is an absolute vicious lie lie said jones she 
would never make such a statement to an absolute stranger its 
not logical its stupidity 
miss maples turned down the chance to pose for a people 
magazine cover because the story was going to focus on the trump 
marriage jones said he also said she turned down a 250000 offer 
to tell her story to the national enquirer 
the agent also raised the possibility of legal action stemming 
from the stories about his client 
jones has repeatedly denied that miss maples who has yet to 
comment publicly on the divorce is involved romantically with

its not often that depositors rush to 
help bail out a bank but local supporters remember the good times 
with connecticut bank and trust co 
wait a minute said bill faude director of the nonprofit 
old state house group this is good old cbt that has always been 
there for every civic group shelter soup kitchen or fundraising 
drive in this town theyre the ones who drop the first shoe 
theyve had a member on every board they need to know theyve got 
some friends 
faude walked into the bank on tuesday with 50000 of old state 
house funds to put in a certificate of deposit he also drafted a 
letter to the hundreds of other nonprofit groups in the area 
urging them to show their support 
faude came up with the idea last week after hearing of the 
financial woes affecting cbts parent last month the bostonbased 
bank of new england announced an anticipated 1989 loss of 105 
billion due to the slumping real estate market 
the boston bank said it was selling 6 billion in assets as part 
of its recovery plan but some municipalities withdrew funds 
prompting the boston bank to borrow money from the federal reserve 
to tide it over 
cbt lost 355 million last year and lost 16 percent of its 
deposits during the first five weeks of this year according to 
state banking reports 
faudes idea picked up momentum with checks or promises flowing 
in from such groups as the connecticut opera river front 
recapture the urban league and the connecticut historical society 
the groups said theyd either deposit new funds or add to current 
cbt accounts 
sandy bender a bank official said more than 80 percent of the 
banks officers serve in at least one community volunteer position 
the bank provided more than 300 volunteers for the special olympics 
last year and collected more than four tons of food for a food 
drive 
she said withdrawals from the bank have stopped but she was 
impressed by the groups outpouring of support 
its an extremely gracious and supportive gesture bender

reminders of past trial success by marion 
barrys attorney he won the last major perjury case in the 
nations capital and barrys own talk of federal persecution 
could signal defense strategy as the washington mayor fights drug 
and perjury charges 
ive tried three perjury cases before and i dont think 
perjury charges are the hardest to defend against lawyer r 
kenneth mundy told reporters thursday after barry was indicted on 
three felony perjury counts and five misdemeanor charges of cocaine 
possession 
mundy reminded reporters that two years ago he persuaded jurors 
to acquit the former president of the citys public university of 
five perjury charges as well as mail fraud and theft 
the two cases have parallels that may foreshadow the type of 
defense mundy will offer for the mayor 
both barry and robert l green the former president of the 
university of the district of columbia are veterans of the 1960s 
civil rights movement in the south 
as in the green case mundy appears ready to portray barry as a 
scapegoat for white federal prosecutors intent on getting a 
conviction at all costs 
in a statement after the indictment the mayor himself evoked 
the specter of persecution barry undergoing treatment at a drug 
and alcoholism clinic in west palm beach fla called the 
indictment a continuation of the political lynching and excesses 
of the justice department 
in the green case coretta scott king the widow of slain civil 
rights leaders martin luther king jr appeared as a character 
witness as did atlanta mayor andrew young another veteran of the 
southern christian leadership conference 
in his summation mundy recalled greens career as a civil 
rights worker in alabama and mississippi urging jurors to search 
your hearts before judging him guilty or innocent 
earlier in the trial mundy had challenged the credibility of 
greens chief accuser who ironically is a top aide to barry the 
barry case would seem to call for similar tactics especially since 
a key witness will be a convicted drug dealer charles lewis 
lewis says he used cocaine with the mayor on several occasions 
at a downtown hotel in late 1988 barry is charged with lying to a 
grand jury when he said he nothing to do with lewis in relation to 
cocaine 
four of the possession charges also stem from barrys visits to 
lewis hotel room 
in perjury cases said washington criminal lawyer e lawrence 
barcella a former federal prosecutor first of all you have to 
establish the fact then you have to establish the fact that 
someone lied about that fact here they are going to have a lot of 
difficulty establishing the fact 
mundy said that on these lewisrelated charges prosecutors 
appear to be relying on testimony rather than physical evidence of 
drug possession 
but barcella said dopeless drug cases are not unusual 
there have been a lot of cases where there has been no white 
powder on the table he said in an interview 
mundy also is laying the groundwork for a possible entrapment 
defense to the fifth cocaine possession charge which stems from 
barrys jan 18 arrest at a downtown hotel 
barry came to the hotel to see former girlfriend rasheeda moore 
who was cooperating with the fbi 
while mundy admitted in a television interview that the fbi 
caught the mayor redhanded using crack cocaine he also said 
that fbi videotapes of the episode show that ms moore not barry 
first mentioned the subject of cocaine 
he also suggested contrary to an fbi affidavit that ms moore 
lit the pipe from which the mayor smoked the drug 
the barry case was assigned friday to us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson who presided at the 1987 perjury trial of former 
white house aide michael k deaver 
jackson who tentatively scheduled a feb 21 arraignment for 
barry fined deaver 100000 and ordered him to perform community 
service for lying under oath about his lobbying business 
also friday walter fauntroy the district of columbias 
nonvoting delegate to congress said he was agonizing over 
whether to run for mayor 
barry who was first elected mayor in 1978 has given no public 
indication that he will not seek office again though former 
supporters have been slipping away some urging jesse jackson to 
make the race 
calls for barrys resignation also have been increasing the 
washington post said in an editorial friday that barry has lost 
any last claim to a position of leadership and should quit but 
the mayor has said he will not

parliament approved civil marriage among 
members of the predominant greek orthodox church on friday defying 
an excommunication threat by its holy synod 
the decision is expected to lead to a break between the 
unicameral 50member greek cypriot parliament and the church 
the predawn vote after an overnight debate was 30 in favor 12 
against the remaining members were absent 
deputies said the law was designed to bring cyprus legislation 
in line with that of the european economic community and that a 
similar law in greece has existed for years without any objection 
from the greek orthodox church 
lawmakers accused the church of trying to retain the financial 
benefits the fees it gets from its monopoly on performing 
marriages and in divorces 
the synod issued a statement earlier calling the deputies 
intention to allow civil marriage a sacrilege 
the statement said the holy synod considers it its duty to 
make it clear that the church will not succumb to the arrogance of 
any worldly authority and will not abandon the sane sheep of the 
christian flock at the mercy of wolves 
it added that it would fight such a development not with 
weapons of the flesh but those of the spirit sufficiently 
powerful to result in excommunication 
the synod also warned that members of the church marrying under 
civil law or attending as best man or bridesmaid at such 
ceremonies would be automatically excommunicated 
glafcos clerides leader of the largest party the conservative 
democratic rally accused the synod of unacceptable interference 
in the legislative work of the house and contempt for the 
democratically elected representatives of the people 
the parliamentary spokesmen of the three other parties 
centrist socialist and communist branded the synod statement 
variously as anachronistic undemocratic arrogant insulting and 
completely unacceptable

the partly burned body of kenyas foreign 
minister was found friday in a cane field near his home three days 
after he disappeared the government indicated robert ouko had been 
murdered 
president daniel arap moi said the body of the 58yearold 
minister was found in circumstances which at the moment suggest 
foul play about four miles from his family farm in koru not far 
from lake victoria 
the presidents statement said the body was partially burned and 
pledged that anyone who may be associated with this horrible 
event will most certainly be apprehended 
ouko considered one of the most skilled members of mois 
cabinet vanished tuesday his disappearance went unreported until 
thursday evening when the offical kenya news agency broadcast an 
appeal from family members urging him to contact them or government 
officials 
moi said oukos death was a loss for the whole nation 
calling him a brilliant leader an articulate and courageous 
spokesman of this country and a loyal servant of the people 
the minister appeared largely above the fray of kenyan politics 
his name rarely appearing in almost daily press accounts of 
rivalries within the countrys single ruling party 
ouko was last seen publicly on saturday when he addressed a 
service club in kisumu 220 miles northwest of nairobi and not far 
from his koru home 
staterun radio and television stations quoted unidentified 
family members thursday night as saying no one had seen him leave 
his farm after he went to bed monday night 
the kenya times a nairobi daily newspaper reported friday that 
a white car arrived at oukos home at about 3 am tuesday and left 
with the minister the paper attributed its report to two 
unidentified household employees 
before the discovery of oukos body a senior government 
official speaking on condition of anonymity said people are 
wondering how a full minister can disappear he referred to the 
fact that the homes of cabinet ministers are always guarded by 
armed policemen they also use bodyguards when they travel 
ouko first served as permanent secretary in the ministry of 
foreign affairs in 196364 he then held a number of other 
highranking government jobs before being tapped by moi to head the 
foreign ministry in 1979

average residential phone costs dropped nearly 
5 percent nationwide in 1989 as declining longdistance prices 
continued to offset increases for local phone service the federal 
communications commission said friday 
the commission said that based on the labor departments 
consumer price index the cost of telephone service for an average 
residential subscriber fell 03 percent during 1989 
the cpi showed that local service charges increased 06 percent 
while toll charges for instate calls dropped 28 percent and 
interstate longdistance charges fell 13 percent 
the fcc noted that the overall inflation rate was 46 percent 
for 1989 
thus in real terms the cost of telephone service dropped 
about 5 percent during the year the fcc said 
the 06 percent increase in local phone service charges was a 
sharp change from 1988 when such costs rose an average of 45 
percent 
the fcc also released the results of a semiannual 95city 
survey of phone costs that showed the average monthly charge for 
oneparty residential local service with unlimited calling was 
1228 in october 1989 compared with 1232 a year earlier 
when taxes and federal and state subscriber line charges were 
added in the total local service bill averaged 1754 in october 
compared with 1657 in october 1988 the total does not include 
additional charges for touchtone service 
total local charges for unlimited privateline service ranged 
from 814 in anchorage alaska to 2703 in huntington wva 
the fcc said 
the federal subscriber line charge which helps defray the costs 
of connecting the local phone system with longdistance circuits 
was 350 per month for most residential customers in october 1989 
as the subscriber line charge goes up longdistance rates tend 
to go down that is because as longdistance companies pay less for 
the connection charge the fcc requires them to pass the savings 
along to longdistance customers 
the average household spent 499 on phone bills in 1987 the 
most recent year for which such statistics are available the fcc 
said that compared with an average 471 in 1986

when the brothers got into a fistfight in court 
the scuffle erupted as eustaquio deases was called to testify in 
the trial of his brother ruben who according to witnesses 
described the killing in the style of a rap singer 
as eustaquio 23 was led into the courtroom he lunged across 
the defense table swinging at ruben and cursing him ruben struck 
back and the men scuffled until they were separated by sheriffs 
deputies and defense lawyers 
the jury was asked to leave and district judge md seiser 
called a recess 
ruben who turned 18 monday is on trial in story county 
district court for firstdegree murder in the may 28 death of 
jennifer ann gardner 20 who shared an apartment with eustaquio 
another brother edward deases 21 awaits trial on the same charge 
eustaquio is in prison on a federal drug charge 
another brother johnny deases testified previously that edward

stood in the way of edwards advancement in a drugdealing business 
allegedly run by eustaquio 
earlier friday jack leinen a former youth service worker at 
the meyer hall juvenile detention center in des moines testified 
hed heard ruben describe the crime using the style of a rap song

farmers and government officials say the 
cartagena drug summit will have no immediate impact on bolivias 
antidrug campaign 
however the officials are pleased that the united states 
recognized a shared responsibility for cocaine trafficking and will 
provide more financial support for alternative crops to replace 
coca grown by bolivian farmers 
in the shortterm i dont think the cartagena summit will 
have much impact on fighting cocaine trafficking information 
minister manfredo kempff told the associated press in a 
mediumterm though we should be able to count on greater 
collaboration from the united states 
president jaime paz zamora attended thursdays summit in 
cartagena colombia along with presidents bush alan garcia of 
peru and virgilio barco of host colombia 
in their communique the presidents noted that persuading andean 
farmers to turn from coca production to legal crops such as coffee 
would have significant immediate and longterm economic costs 
on colombia peru and bolivia 
bush said he would request an economic aid package from congress 
for fiscal years 199194 to help offset some of these losses the 
communique said 
some critics say we received no firm monetary commitments 
kempff said we went to cartagena for the united states to 
understand our position to make a firm commitment to fight against 
cocaine trafficking and from there intensify the fight with greater 
foreign collaboration now the effective collaboration must come 
evo morales leader of the chapare regions cocaleaf farmers 
union said the cartagena summit did not provide concrete programs 
to address the needs of farmers 
in the summit declarations there is nothing clear and it does 
not assure us markets or prices for alternative crops we do not 
trust the bolivian or american governments morales said 
pastor velazquez leader of the countrys farmers confederation 
said only general positions were approved at the summit he 
said without more funds invested in rural areas eradicating coca 
will remain practically paralyzed 
velazquez added that coffee is often mentioned as a possible 
alternative crop but noted even colombia is worried because the 
price for that product is so low 
undersecretary of justice roger pando said the cartagena 
declaration backs our position of alternative development and 
makes it possible for the united states and europe to understand 
bolivias investment requirements to substitute coca leaves 
bolivian farmers destroyed a record 3038 acres of coca plants 
in december and january and tens of thousands of cocaleaf farmers 
left the chapare the countrys principal cocaleaf producing 
region this was in response to a sharp drop in cocaleaf prices 
from the colombian drug crackdown and increased interdiction by 
bolivian police and us drug enforcement administration agents 
in bolivia about 93600 acres are devoted to cocaleaf 
cultivation 
in peru however eradication programs were suspended one year 
ago and there is strong sentiment among coca growers the 
government and the general public against forced eradication the 
government of alan garcia has linked voluntary eradication to 
receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in economic development 
aid to provide alternative sources of income for cocagrowing 
peasants 
in bolivia farmers receive 2000 us dollars for every 
hectare 24 acres of coca destroyed the us government is 
providing about 40 million for fiscal year 1990 for crop 
substitution programs fifteen million dollars are budgeted this 
year for cocaine interdiction program additional us funds are 
only now beginning to reach bolivia due to delays in congress 
total us aid to bolivia is about 100 million 
cocaine provides the bolivian economy the poorest in south 
america with at least 300 million a year the countrys total 
legal export earnings are about twice that amount 
the government says at least 500 million are needed for 
alternative development programs to wean farmers from cocaleaf 
farming at least 250000 farmers live from cocaleaf cultivation 
in the bolivian subtropical lowlands 
we will maintain a steady rhythm of eradication that is 
acceptable and encourage consuming nations to fulfill their 
obligations to help develop alternative crops kempff said

the owner of a pit bull dog who fatally 
mauled a toddler who wandered within reach of its chain was ordered 
friday to spend three years and eight months in prison 
michael patrick berry 39 was convicted in december of 
involuntary manslaughter in the death of 2yearold james soto and 
three lesser charges a santa clara county superior court jury 
acquitted him of seconddegree murder 
berrys pit bull willy mauled the child after the child 
wandered into berrys yard where the dog was tethered to a stake 
berry claimed during his trial that the toddlers parents shared 
the blame for his death because they allowed him to wander near the 
dog 
the victims father arthur said he and his wife had left the 
boy on their back patio while they went shopping at garage sales 
and found him being torn apart when they came home 
deputy district attorney dale sanderson acknowledged there was 
no evidence of malice or intent to kill but that their case was 
based on the theory of implied malice which allows a murder 
conviction for someone whose actions show wanton disregard for 
human life 
willy since the attack has been kept alive as evidence at the 
santa clara county humane society but eventually will be killed 
berry was the first person in the united states to be charged 
with murder because of an animals action according to the 
prosecutor and the humane society of the united states

seventeen creditor nations agreed friday to 
reschedule nearly onefourth of polands 40 billion foreign debt 
and suspend payments on it until march 1991 as a way to help the 
hardpressed new noncommunist government 
the agreement is the most generous so far by the informal 
grouping of creditor nations known as the paris club said 
jeanclaude trichet club chairman 
trichet said the arrangement negotiated over two days reflects 
western support for the government and its radical plans for 
adopting a market economy 
fridays agreement allows poland to reschedule 94 billion of 
its 27 billion debt to paris club nations including 34 billion 
of arrears 
the covered debt which was due march 1 1991 is to be spread 
over 14 years with an eightyear grace period on principal 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki of poland sent messages to 
creditor governments feb 9 asking them to suspend principal and 
interest payments for 1989 and 1990 on the entire 40 billion 
poland owes and to consider freezing the debt or even reducing it 
mazowiecki said the debt was the greatest threat to polands 
dramatic attempt to switch from a centrally controlled economy to a 
freemarket system 
after march 1991 poland will pay only interest on the 94 
billion for seven years after which the principal is to be paid 
over six years 
henryk wozniakowski deputy government spokesman said in warsaw 
the agreement will reduce payments to the west by about onefourth 
poland had been paying about 15 billion a year on annual interest 
of 37 billion 
trichet described the accord as exceptional 
janusz sawicki head of the polish delegation said it was the 
best poland could obtain and should be viewed as a response to the 
mazowieckis appeal the polish news agency pap reported 
the paris club agreed with mazowieckis suggestion that 
consultatons be held on the possibility of reducing the debt in 
cooperation with the international monetary fund pap reported 
two weeks ago the imf approved polands economic restructuring 
plan which involves eliminating a huge budget deficit by cutting 
subsidies to unprofitable staterun industries and attracting 
foreign investment by establishing a convertible currency 
elimination of price controls and subsidies created 78 percent 
inflation for january alone the world bank estimates ending 
industrial subsidies will cost 17 million jobs in 1990 
polands foreign debt is the largest in eastern europe the 
partial payments it was making consumed nearly all its hard 
currency earnings leaving little to rebuild its obsolete industry 
most of the debt was accumulated during the 1970s when edward 
gierek was communist party chief he spent borrowed western money 
on illconceived projects and on consumer goods in an effort to 
win public support

the state department said friday 
it said that a number of members of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade gatt including the united states have 
expressed concern about measures china has taken which restrict

we believe these questions need to be adequately addressed 
before further action is possible on chinas application the 
department said in a written response to press questions 
at the same time the department said it was looking forward to 
the eventual inclusion of taiwan in gatts membership because of 
the islands importance in the global trading system 
it added that the united states has maintained a consistent 
policy on gatt membership for both china and taiwan over the years 
we have told both parties that we want eventual access for 
both on meaningful terms agreed upon by gatt members it said

jewish groups concluded an agreement friday 
with the us government to pay for the resettling of up to 8000 
soviet refugees mostly jews in the united states 
the council of jewish federations and the hebrew immigrant aid 
society will cover the costs of processing and transporting the 
refugees and pay for their medical examinations placement and 
initial resettlement for two years after they enter the country 
the estimated cost is about 30 million 
besides jews the refugees include armenians evangelical 
christians ukrainian catholics and ukrainian orthodox 
the 8000 refugees are among the 10000 that president bush last 
october decided to admit in the current fiscal year if private 
funding was obtained another 40000 jewish refugees from the 
soviet union are emigrating with us funds 
other us programs including one known as parole could bring 
in up to 30000 more 
in the first four months of this fiscal year which began oct 
1 21000 soviet jewish refugees have entered the united states 
some 20000 are waiting in rome and vienna they should be admitted 
by next summer and the waystations will be closed down 
processing of refugees is being switched to us offices in the 
soviet union 
the jewish exodus is spurred by a more lenient soviet emigration 
policy and a resurgence of overt antisemitism it far exceeds the 
quota and thousands of jews who might normally come here are going 
to israel instead

existing problems the democratic alliance of kosovo a new

describe the autonomy movement

a couple conceived a child in hopes the 
babys bone marrow cells could save the life of a teenage daughter 
who is dying of cancer but ethics experts said friday the decision 
is outrageous and troubling 
such criticism means little to abe ayala and his wife mary 
they found out this week that despite oneinfour odds their 
unborn baby girl will be a compatible bone marrow stem cell 
donor for their 17yearold daughter anissa who was diagnosed 
with leukemia two years ago 
weve been searching for a donor for almost two years and we 
havent been able to find anybody so this is the only other 
alternative ayala said in a telephone interview friday we 
cant just stand idly by and do nothing about it and wait for 
anissa to die 
the ayalas live in the los angeles suburb of walnut with anissa 
and a 19yearold son airon they were told that anissa has a 70 
percent to 80 percent chance of surviving if she receives a 
transplant of stem cells bone marrow cells that help produce 
various blood cells but no chance if she doesnt her father said 
none of the alayas have compatible marrow 
so against the advice of anissas doctor and after years of 
resisting his wifes wish to have another child the 45yearold 
ayala had his vasectomy reversed last year mrs alaya 43 is due 
to deliver a baby girl in april 
if not for anissas leukemia its true we would have never 
had another baby this late ayala said 
it is troublesome to say the least medical ethics expert 
philip boyle said from the hastings center think tank in briarcliff 
manor ny its outrageous that people would go to this length 
the ideal reason for having a child is associated with that 
childs own welfare to bring a child into being and to nurture 
it said alexander morgan capron a professor of law and medicine 
at the university of southern california 
one of the fundamental precepts of ethics is that each 
person is an end in himself or herself and is never to be used 
solely as a means to another persons ends without the agreement of 
the person being used he said 
the baby cant consent to the transplant and the parents face a 
conflict of interest in making the decision the experts said 
the ayalas baby is not seen as an end in itself but as a 
means to another end the fact that the other end is laudable 
doesnt change that capron said 
anissa said friday she is sort of upset by such criticism of 
her parents but were going to love our baby 
mrs ayala added our baby is going to have more love than she 
probably can put up with 
leukemia is a cancer of white blood cells doctors use highdose 
radiation and chemotherapy to kill diseased bone marrow and blood 
cells then marrow from a matching donor usually a sibling is 
injected into the leukemia patients bones so healthy stem cells 
from the marrow can produce healthy blood cells 
ayala said his daughters leukemia is now stable and doctors 
expect she will be alive even if they have to wait until her baby 
sister is 6 months old the youngest age at which marrow can be 
transplanted 
however anissas doctors at city of hope national medical 
center in suburban duarte hope to make the marrow transplant 
unnecessary by obtaining stem cells from the babys umbilical cord 
blood at the time of birth a painless procedure hospital 
spokesman charles mathews said 
the doctors have said the baby faces little risk even if she is 
needed to donate marrow the procedure requires the infant to be 
put under general anesthesia to block pain while needles are used 
to remove the marrow 
the problem remains a child will have been created for the 
purpose of being a donor capron said 
the ayalas decision means were willing to treat people like 
objects and i dont think we ought to do that boyle said 
he said similar reasoning might be used to justify fetus 
farming so live infants could be used as organ donors or to 
rationalize conceiving fetuses so they can be aborted and their 
tissues used for lifesaving purposes such as treating parkinsons 
disease patients 
mrs ayala said she and her husband prayed hard before 
making their decision and ethics experts should be worrying about 
the grave need for more organ and marrow donors rather than 
questioning their decision 
there are thousands of people out there who are dying and need 
bone marrow transplants she said

israeli aircraft staged a surprise attack on a 
southern lebanese base of the shiite moslem group amal on friday 
the military command said 
an amal source said two israeli helicopter gunships dropped four 
rockets into an empty amal position but that no casualties were 
reported to amal headquarters in beirut 
the israeli army said the attack was in alhajjah a village six 
miles south of the lebanese port of sidon and a staging point for 
joint attacks by amal and the palestinian groups 
the amal source said the position was near the shiite town of 
zifta about 2 miles southeast of alhajjah 
the army did not say what type of aircraft took part in the 
attack but that all returned safely 
it was israels fourth air raid into lebanon this year and army 
sources said it came two days after a palestinian attack in 
israels selfproclaimed security zone in southern lebanon the 
last israeli attack was jan 25 against a palestinian guerrilla 
base of the abu nidal faction east of sidon 
israel has no absolutely no interest in a confrontation with 
the amal movement but if this process continues israel would not be 
able to sit idly and will have to respond an israeli army 
official said 
the attack on amal was highly unusual since that movement has 
been widely described by israeli military observers as being at 
odds with israels fiercest enemies in south lebanon palestinian 
guerrillas and the radical shiite hezbollah or party of god group 
however israeli army sources said palestinian groups were 
assisted by senior amal commanders at least three times in 
sending squads to carry out attacks in israels security zone 
in south lebanon 
one was a jan 26 incident in which an israeli army officer was 
injured in a mine explosion in south lebanon and soldiers also came 
under light arms fire in a separate attack said the sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the democratic front for the liberation of palestine a 
syrianbased palestine liberation organization faction led by nayef 
hawatmeh claimed responsibility for the shooting 
the sources cited a feb 3 clash in which two guerrillas of the 
palestine liberation front led by terrorist mastermind abul abbas 
or mohammed abbas were killed in a firefight with israeli troops 
in the security zone there were no israeli casualties 
in addition amal assisted in the democratic fronts 
infiltration of the zone wednesday the sources said one guerrilla 
was shot and killed by israeli troops and israelibacked south 
lebanon army militiamen captured three others 
the mostly christian 2500member militia helps israeli troops 
in patrolling the security zone a 2to12miledeep strip 
designed as a buffer against border attacks by palestinian and 
shiite moslem guerrillas 
israel carved out the zone in june 1985 as it withdrew the bulk 
of its troops from lebanon following a threeyear campaign

veteran soul singer ike turner was 
sentenced friday to four years in prison on cocaine charges and a 
prosecutor said he hopes jail will help the 58yearold onetime 
music star 
our hope is that when he gets out hell do something along the 
lines of rehabilitation said deputy district attorney ralph 
mayer hes not the type of criminal thats in any way violent or 
selling the drugs hes just a 20year abuser of the drugs who 
should have been caught a long time ago 
turner admitted in 1986 that he had been addicted to cocaine for 
15 years 
following sentencing by superior court judge robert altman 
turner was handed over to a los angeles county sheriffs deputy for 
delivery to a state prison mayer said he didnt know which prison 
its the first time hes been to state prison said mayer 
four years for a man in his late 50s hell be over 60 when he 
gets out i think thats appropriate 
last month a superior court jury convicted the exhusband of 
grammy winner tina turner of two drug misdemeanors driving under 
the influence of cocaine and being under the influence of cocaine 
the panel deadlocked on two felony charges transportation of 
cocaine and possession of cocaine for sale forcing a mistrial 
turner then pleaded guilty avoiding another trial mayer said 
mayer also consolidated a los angeles possession of cocaine case 
pending against turner a twoyear sentence on that charge will run 
concurrently 
the charges stem from an aug 19 1987 arrest by sheriffs 
deputies who stopped turner after the car he was in was seen 
traveling erratically in west hollywood 
deputies found crystallized cocaine in a dental floss container 
and in a packet of foil 
a clarksdale miss native turner was a backup rhythm and 
blues musician in the early 1950s he went on to lead his own 
group the ikettes before forming the ike and tina turner review 
with his former wife the latter group known for allout 
highenergy performances had a string of hit records including 
proud mary and river deep mountain high 
in 1976 after nearly 16 years of marriage the two divorced

defense minister nicolae militaru 
either quit or was fired friday after a fiveday protest by 
officers who demanded he be dismissed for serving the dictatorship 
of nicolae ceausescu 
a brief announcement on state television indicated militaru who 
is 74 and came out of retirement to head the ministry after 
ceausescus downfall did not go voluntarily 
ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 and executed dec 25 
the president of the provisional council of national unity 
ion iliescu has accepted the request to remove army gen nicolae 
militaru from the office of minister of national defense the 
television reported who requested the removal was not clear 
it said lt gen victor anastase stancalescu economy minister 
and first deputy defense minister was appointed to replace him 
the demand for militarus resignation was the first army 
challenge to the government it helped create 
hundreds of officers had remained outside government 
headquarters since monday demanding militaru and interior minister 
mihai chitac be dismissed for links to ceausescu and alleged action 
against demonstrators in timisoara the western city where the 
december revolution began 
most of them left victory square early friday after the 
government promised to investigate their complaints the 
announcement of militarus removal indicated they may have been 
told of it in advance 
other demonstrations took place in timisoara and the black sea 
port of constanta the officers said 
in militarus defense the television said he played a special 
part in defeating the terrorist forces that supported ceausescus 
dictatorial regime in romania 
but the statement read on tv also cited the officers complaint 
that militaru stirred discontent in the army 
some of the measures and methods used by the leadership of the 
ministry of national defense caused dissatisfaction within the 
army thus contributing to the emergence of a state of tension 
which could have been avoided it said 
soldiers battled agents of the dreaded securitate secret police 
for several days after the fall of the communist dictator who had 
been in power 24 years 
four securitate officers went on trial friday in bucharest they 
are charged with helping ceausescu flee by obtaining a helicopter 
that took the dictator and his wife elena who was tried and 
executed with him from the capital to snagov 20 miles to the 
north 
late thursday the television showed edited film of vice premier 
gelu voican meeting with 58 officers listening to their complaints 
and promising to investigate 
why allow the army to be destabilized for the sake of one 
man a colonel asked after years of living a life of 
leisure he said militaru cannot know what reforms are so 
drastically needed 
a border guards officer accused chitac the interior minister 
of personal involvement in suppression of protesters in timisoara 
the army turned against ceausescu on dec 22 and fought the 
securitate 
other officers were shown saying many of their fellows who 
opposed the revolution still were in uniform 
one spoke of majors who shot into the demonstrators about 710 
minutes with an automatic rifle another said the army had been 
killing innocent people and added we were shooting each 
other 
we didnt know for sure on which side each commander was a 
captain said what are these compromised people still doing 
here 
none of the officers was identified by name 
the broadcast seemed to reflect a pledge by the new broadcasting 
chief razvan teodorescu that state televison would give more time 
to independent views 
opposition parties have accused the national salvation front 
which took power during the revolution of using official media 
against them

colombias avianca airlines is cutting off 
expense money to families of the victims of last months boeing 707 
crash on long island which killed 73 people 
the airline paid hotel bills through thursday for relatives of 
the victims 85 of whom survived the jan 25 crash and many of 
whom are hospitalized on long island 
after that the airline will advance no more than 2500 per 
passenger in order to alleviate any personal hardship sustained 
as a result of the hospitalization of the injured passenger 
according to a feb 14 letter from avianca to the victims 
relatives 
a copy of the letter was provided by a lawyer for some victims 
of flight 52 
it is the most callous disgraceful thing ive ever heard of 
especially in view of the fact that they owe them a minimum of 
75000 under the warsaw convention said kenneth p nolan a 
manhattan lawyer specializing in aviation accidents who represents 
10 crash victims 
the warsaw convention limits damages on international flights to 
75000 per person unless victims can prove willful misconduct by 
the airline in which case victims can sue for more than 75000 
avianca is going to take that 2500 out of the 75000 so 
all theyre doing is advancing them money that is owed to them 
nolan said 
he said he thought avianca should make the full 75000 
available to crash victims now 
seventythree people died in the crash 
avianca also pledged in the letter to continue to pay the 
medical and hospital expenses of the surviving passengers as 
well as medically necessary outpatient care and to provide 
return transportation to colombia for immediate family once the 
patient is released from the hospital 
avianca referred calls for comment to its lawyer michael 
holland of condon amp forsyth in manhattan he is out of the country 
until tuesday and an associate george tompkins did not 
immediately return a call for comment 
nolan said that among those who will be hurt by the 2500 limit 
on expenses is a woman who traveled to long island from colombia to 
be near her 20yearold daughter astrid ballesteros lopez while 
she recuperates at glen cove community hospital 
the daughter has had surgery for a broken ankle both her 
legs she broke her arm she fractured her skull she has her jaw 
wired for a fractured jaw she had some facial reconstruction and 
she may have potential brain damage said nolan who represents 
the woman

the main opposition coalition will 
recognize a victory by the ruling leftist sandinista party if next 
weeks elections are fair an opposition official said friday 
also friday two people were killed 85 miles northeast of 
managua but versions differed as to whether it was an attack by 
usbacked contras on sandinista supporters or a holdup 
antonio lacayo campaign manager for the united national 
opposition uno predicted his coalition will win the feb 25 
election by 15 percent over the sandinistas 
but lacayo soninlaw of the groups presidential candidate 
violeta barrios de chamorro said that in the remote chance of a 
sandinista victory the coalition would be willing to accept it 
provided international observers declared the elections free and 
fair 
if the majority decides the next government should be one of 
the sandinista front i believe that we at uno will respect the 
results dona violeta has said so very clearly this is 
democracy he told a news conference 
lacayo also dismissed an exchange of threats between the 
coalitions vice presidential candidate virgilio godoy and 
president daniel ortega calling them simply campaign speeches 
ortega had demanded an explanation of statements godoy made in 
speeches that the coalition was going to make the sandinistas 
pay after the elections in campaign speeches ortega who is 
seeking reelection for a sixyear term returned the threat 
he said that if his sandinistas win they will shut down mrs 
chamorros newspaper la prensa and confiscate her house and that 
of godoys 
uno in its government program emphasizes national 
reconciliation and is completely incompatible with making 
anybody pay lacayo said 
ortega said in the town of boaco that contra rebels attacked 
sandinista supporters on their way a campaign rally there but 
the people without weapons jumped on them and stoned them 
he said 
ortegas was the third version so far of the incident 3 miles 
outside juigalpa at around 730 am friday 
carlos jose estrada who said he witnessed the incident said 
two contras in camouflage uniform and carrying ak47 rifles stopped 
two pickup trucks carrying sandinistas to the rally 
he said one passenger identified as armengor espinoza shot and 
killed one contra the other contra returned fire and killed 
espinoza and wounded another passenger 
but the receptionist at the camilo ortega hospital in juigalpa 
where all victims were taken said the attackers were masked 
highway robbers not contras 
defense and interior ministry spokesmen in managua said they had 
no information on the attack other than what they heard on the 
radio and repeated telephone calls to police in juigalpa did not 
get through

the interstate commerce commission voted 
unanimously friday to continue service on the ailing delaware amp 
hudson railway for another week while a bankruptcy trustee tries to 
organize a new plan for the nations oldest railroad to run itself 
under various subsidies 
i think were all of one mind that the service should be 
maintained icc chairman edward j philbin said at a hearing 
the icc voted 40 with one commissioner absent to allow three 
railroads to continue to run on damph tracks the new york 
susquehanna amp western which operates the damph under earlier icc 
orders lackawanna valley railroad corp and north shore railroad 
co 
in the meantime the trustee is working out a plan under which 
the damph would be subsidized by the states of new york and 
pennsylvania two shippers two canadian railroads and a third 
unidentified railroad said charles h white jr counsel for the 
damph trustee 
the whole exercise is for the trustee to run the railroad 
himself white said afterwards in other words for the damph to 
run the damph 
he identified the shippers as general electric corp and 
international paper co the two canadian railroads canadian 
national and canadian pacific are interested in buying the damph 
white estimated the subsidies would amount to 500000 or more a 
month but when asked for a copy of the agreement white said there 
wasnt one its up here he said pointing at his forehead 
the damph in june 1988 filed for court protection from its 
creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws the line has debts of 
about 100 million 
damph which began in 1824 as a canal company runs 20 to 25 
trains daily an important connection with canadian railroads the 
damph owns 569 miles of track mostly in new york and pennsylvania 
has rights to run trains over another 1012 miles of track of other 
railroads a shutdown would put 672 employees out of work 
earlier this month bankruptcy trustee francis p dicello 
recommended that the damph be sold to canadian pacific ltd parent 
company of the canadian pacific which bid 35 million but the 
sale fell through when canadian pacific was unable to secure from 
conrail the rights to run on its tracks from harrisburg pa to 
hagerstown md 
a competing bid by the canadian national railways also fell 
apart after the railroad lost its financial backing 
however lawyers for both canadian railroads said friday their 
clients were still interested in buying the delaware amp hudson 
we very much would like to reach an arrangement with 
conrail said canadian pacific lawyer terrence hines

show spain is moving to improve its poor record regarding its 
natural resources

protection legislation within the 12nation ec 
last year the ec cited spain for 57 infractions of european

tests show that a daycare center 
owner accused of possessing child pornography does not have a 
sexually transmitted disease found in three children who attended 
his preschool police said friday 
john w shaver who faces felony charges of possessing child 
pornography and procuring the sexual performance of a child is 
currently free on 75000 bond he was given a venereal test 
wednesday as part of the conditions for his release from jail 
were trying to determine the source of that infection and so 
far we have not said police spokesman ott cefkin at the time 
that they took a sample from mr shaver that was a few days ago 
it was negative for the disease 
shaver 56 was charged last month with possessing child 
pornography after authorities discovered 3200 photos of nude and 
seminude children at his home twenty children from shavers 
preschool were identified in the photos police said 
on tuesday police added 24 counts of procuring the sexual 
performance of a child the new charges involve allegedly 
pornographic photo montages found in shavers home that combine 
pictures of preschoolers with nude pictures from magazines 
none of the charges against shaver relate to any known physical 
contact with children and police have found no evidence that 
children at the center were sexually abused cefkin said 
the courtordered test of shaver was made after police 
discovered gonorrhea in throat cultures of three children who 
attended shavers rainbow learning center 
you have to look at everybody that had contact with these 
children cefkin added as far as mr shaver is converned they 
attended his daycare center and this seems to be the only common 
link among the three 
shavers attorney j david bogenschutz said the negative 
result from the broward county health department would help to 
exonerate his client 
it means that three children have been found at least as far 
as we know from the testing to be positive and my client has been 
negative 
the three children were treated for the disease gonorrhea can 
be cured with penicillin or other antibiotics 
the countys sexual assault treatment center tested children who 
attended the fort lauderdale preschool after police said they found 
nude photographs of children at shavers home medical tests on all 
the children have not been completed cefkin said 
cefkin said he did not know of anyone else being tested for 
gonorrhea in connection with the police investigation into whether 
children at the center were sexually abused 
about 200 children have attended shavers preschool since its 
opening in 1985 county officials closed it down this month as the 
police investigation widened 
shaver operated a daycare center in hawaii before opening the 
rainbow learning center but hawaiian officials stripped his state 
license amid allegations that he fondled children in his care no 
criminal charges were filed in that case

feminist groups friday called for a 
congressional investigation of mexicos leading antinarcotics 
enforcement officer saying he protected police from charges that 
they committed a series of gang rapes 
norma vasquez a spokeswoman for the national network against 
violence toward women told a news conference that bodyguards of 
assistant attorney general javier coello trejo had been identified 
as suspects since september but were not arrested until january 
coello had covered up for the criminals letting them go free 
and they continued to commit more rapes until they were arrested 
ms vasquez said 
a spokesman for the federal attorney generals office 
immediately denied coello did anything wrong and said the suspects 
were arrested when they were identified 
coello is in charge of a highly publicized effort by the 
government of president carlos salinas de gortari to fight drug 
trafficking and reduce mexicos reputation for corruption in law 
enforcement 
four officers of the federal judicial police which is under 
coellos command were arrested last month and are awaiting trial 
on charges of gang rape kidnapping abuse of authority and robbery 
the suspects three of whom served as bodyguards for coello 
were arrested after 14 women filed complaints in a series of rapes 
in southern mexico city last year 
the case has embarrassed the attorney generals office and 
focused attention on the issue of rape rarely discussed or 
prosecuted in mexico 
juana santos a member of the womens group said the case was a 
symbol of raised consciousness about rape 
we are beginning to notice changes this is an example of 
those changes ms santos said 
ms vasquez said the womens network an umbrella organization 
of 10 feminist groups in the capital was calling for a 
congressional hearing on coellos actions 
he must explain how this was allowed to go on vasquez said 
she said the network is in constant contact with the rape victims 
and their families who want to remain anonymous and will not speak 
to reporters 
arturo antelmo a spokesman for the attorney generals office 
said no action was taken against the men until january because 
internally we did not know who they were 
but the weekly magazine proceso quoted a special prosecutor as 
saying the mexico city prosecutors office received photographs of 
the three bodyguards from coellos agency in september 
rene gonzalez de la vega in charge of the case was quoted as 
saying that in each of the 14 cases the women were with male 
companions when they were kidnapped by men in a police car and 
gangraped all the cases took place within a halfmile radius in 
the southern part of the city 
last year 1500 rapes were reported in mexico city but ms 
vasquez said they make up only a small percentage of the total 
because it takes a lot of strength to go through the legal 
process and repeatedly relive the rape experience 
seven of the women who originally filed complaints decided later 
not to press charges because of threats she said

president bush signed a 98 billion 
measure approving funds for the state department on friday but 
told congress he would ignore parts reinforcing sanctions on china 
and dictating the conduct of diplomacy 
bush in a statement said that the sanctions as well as a 
requirement that sensitive diplomatic contacts like national 
security advisers mission to beijing last june be reported to 
congress were an infringement on his constitutional prerogatives 
as president 
the legislation authorizes 48 billion for the state department 
and related agencies for the current fiscal year and another 5 
billion for the year beginning oct 1 this years funds already 
have been appropriated 
the bill repeals 1951 legislation permitting immigration 
authorities to bar visitors on the basis of their political 
beliefs the provision has been used to bar a number of world 
notables over the years in the 1980s it kept canadian naturalist 
farley mowat out of the united states because of a satirical 
comment about shooting at b52s 
bush had vetoed an earlier version of the legislation primarily 
over an amendment by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny that 
would have prohibited the administration from seeking thirdcountry 
financing of insurgent groups like the contras in nicaragua 
congress dropped that proposal from the current legislation as 
us support of the contras dwindled under a 1988 bipartisan accord 
with congress 
bush praised congress for removing that provision but said i 
regret that the congress has included several provisoins that raise 
constitutional difficulties 
the bill sought to write into law a series of sanctions that 
bush imposed on china in the wake of last mays bloody crackdown in 
tiananmen square 
they included a ban on military sales to china and restrictions 
on exports and foreign aid 
bush declared that legislatively mandated sanctions represent 
an unwise constraint upon the presidents ability to conduct 
foreign policy 
nonetheless bush said he could sign the bill because it gives 
him discretion to disregard the sanctions if he finds that doing so 
is in the national interest 
deputy press secretary stephen hart said that the sanctions 
imposed by bush and reinforced by the legislation all remain in 
effect anyway 
bush also balked at another section that would require the state 
department to report secret diplomatic contacts 
the restriction was an outgrowth of the clandesdine trip to 
beijing last june shortly after the tiananmen square crackdown by 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger 
bush put congress on notice that he would flatly ignore the 
requirement saying it would compromise my constitutional 
authority over such negotiations 
such blanket reporting requirements could be read to comple 
the disclosure of sensitive ongoing negotiations bush said 
bushs statements were the latest chapter in a series of 
confrontations with congress over china policy 
earlier this year he won a veto battle with congress on 
legislation that would have extended visas of chinese students 
studying in the united states the senate sustained bushs veto 
after he asserted that he was affording similar protection to the 
chinese students by executive order 
the measure he signed also wold provide 16 million in startup 
funds for tv marti which will broadcast from the united states 
into cuba and be a sister station to the radio marti that has 
operated for several years

defense secretary 
dick cheney staring across the korean frontier at north korean 
soldiers staring back said friday that communism remains a very 
hostile and threatening foe in asia even as it seems to be 
dissolving in europe 
cheney slogged through mud and fog to make his way to this 
mountainhigh outpost along the frontier that bisects communist 
north korea and the capitalist south which are technically still 
at war under the longest truce in modern military history 
as the defense secretary used bright yellow binoculars to peer 
north across the scrubcovered hills and gullies a feminine voice 
wafted across the chill air a north korean propaganda broadcast 
demanding the pullout of us troops 
in the distance at a small bunkered north korean post two 
soldiers could be seen staring back at the american visitors 
staring at them from the south korean barbedwire observation post 
its always useful to come back to the demilitarized zone 
cheney told reporters accompanying him at a time when we are 
welcoming changes in eastern europe and the erosion of the soviet 
position in the warsaw pact its important to be reminded that the 
united states and the republic of korea still face a very hostile 
and threatening power in the north 
and its just as important for us to maintain our 
determination to protect freedom and democracy here in korea and 
elsewhere in the world cheney said 
the defense secretary had been forced to scrub a scheduled 
morning visit to the panmunjom truce village in the morning due to 
the thick fog but he was able to visit this outpost in the 
strategic chorwon valley later in the day after the air cleared 
cheney was transported several dozen miles northward from seoul 
to the dmz by blackhawk helicopter arriving in the mountainous 
chorwon region which was one of the main routes taken by the 
communist forces during the 1950 invasion 
in a briefing conducted in english by south korean lt col 
chang gwangil cheney was told that some of the scrubcovered 
hills he viewed saw some of the most brutal and lengthy battles of 
the 195053 korean war pork chop hill tbone hill old baldy in 
all the united states lost 34000 men in battle another 20000 
from other causes the south koreans suffered more than 225000 
deaths while the north koreans are thought to have lost 300000 
lives and its chinese ally another 200000 
we will never forget we fought here sidebyside the young 
colonel told cheney were ready to fight 
cheney was joined by several korean generals in symbolically 
ringing a huge bell hung high in a red bell tower perched upon one 
of the hilltops the bell was rung five times to honor the south 
korean 5th division that guards the region 
cheney left south korea saturday morning for hong kong 
earlier in the day the defense secretary lunched with some of 
the 43000 us troops stationed here that are posted near the 
border and attempted to answer their queries about the 
budgetdriven cuts in the military one observer said 
cheney asked that no generals be present during his session with 
the 12 sergeants major of the 2nd division 
cheney travels saturday to hong kong before traveling on to the 
philippines and japan as part of a twoweek asian tour of allied 
nations that host us forces 
during his talks with korean officials on thursday cheney 
informed them that the pentagon wants to cut some 10 percent to 12 
percent of its 120000 troops from south korean japan and the 
philippines over the next three years 
he also got a pledge from the korean officials whose economy 
enjoys a trade surplus with the united states to hike their 
financial support for the troops stationed here 
since the us government contends it spends 24 billion 
annually to support the military here cheney asked the south 
koreans to at least double their 300 million in funding for the 
us military

prime minister tadusez mazowiecki spoke 
with mikhail s gorbachev on friday and urged the soviet leader to 
demand that poland take part in negotiations on the reunification 
of germany 
mazowiecki reiterating polish fears that a united germany would 
try to reclaim land ceded to poland after world war ii also 
discussed the issue with east german prime minister hans modrow 
mazowiecki wants poland to be a part of reunification 
negotiations already planned for the two germanys and four world 
war ii allies that divided them the soviet union united states 
france and britain 
in paris an official source speaking off the record said france 
and britain have discussed the polish proposal and agreed it should 
at least be considered although they were unsure what role poland 
should actually have in the negotiations 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher addressing 
an election rally late friday in halle east germany said that 
immediately after the east german balloting march 18 east and west 
germany must declare they have no territorial claims against their 
european neighbors after reunification 
this applies especially to poland he said but he 
apparently made no mention of poland joining the german unification 
talks 
mazowiecki spoke for about 25 minutes to gorbachev officials 
said 
later in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov said the sixcountry formula for the negotiations does 
not rule out participation by poland which suffered most as the 
result of german aggression the official news agency pap 
reported 
mazowiecki also got a sympathetic ear from modrow who agreed 
that polands borders should be left intact 
however modrow leads the remnants of a communist system that 
was overthrown last year and that likely will be voted out when 
east germans hold their first free elections on march 18 
the cause for concern among many poles has been west german 
chancellor helmut kohl who has refused to promise poland that a 
united germany would not stake a claim to its preworld war ii 
borders 
modrow making a oneday visit to warsaw gave full 
understanding of polands concerns and said his government is 
ready to back polands demand government spokeswoman malgorzata 
niezabitowska said 
mazowiecki also summoned us ambassador john davis and french 
ambassador claude harel to present polands demand for direct 
participation in the talks the state news agency pap said 
during a speech to the foreign committees of the two houses of 
parliament modrow reiterated his governments acceptance of of 
polands western border which incorporates 40000 square miles of 
formerly german lands 
the german democratic republic understands the will of the 
republic of poland to uphold its interests whenever the borders and 
questions of political security are being discussed he said 
mazowiecki after meeting with modrow said the german 
unification process has to take into consideration the the rights 
of german neighbors 
poland doesnt have to take part in everything but it has to 
take part in everything that concerns poland it has to be 
present mazowiecki said according to pap 
solidarity leader lech walesa pressed the need for polish 
participation one must not talk about polish borders without 
poles he said in a telephone interview with the associated press 
genscher on thursday had rejected polish participation in the 
talks saying no polish territories would be included in the 
reunited germany the us state department has also said it sees 
no need to admit poland to the talks 
mrs niezabitowska said poland was hoping to win soviet backing 
for its opinion and was launching diplomatic initiatives with the 
six countries involved in the reunification talks announced 
tuesday during a foreign ministers conference in ottawa 
a government spokesman later said mazowiecki also was drafting a 
letter on its demand to the four occupying powers 
pap provided no details of mazowieckis conversation with 
gorbachev but the agency reported from moscow that gerasimov said 
the soviet government approaches with understanding polands 
concerns

a 61yearold man was arrested for the murder of 
a miami police officer in 1946 thanks to an anonymous tip from a 
consciencestricken witness eight months ago authorities said 
friday 
leroy strachan a freight elevator operator admitted to miami 
detectives in late january that he had shot the officer when he was 
17 police said the victim officer john milledge was one of 
miamis first black police officers 
strachan was arrested thursday on a firstdegree murder warrant 
said miami detective george cadavid 
he knew us said cadavid he said are you going to 
arrest me and asked to call his attorney in miami 
he has admitted shooting the policeman and there is other 
evidence cadavid said 
strachan refused to waive his right to fight extradition during 
a brief arraignment at manhattan criminal court on friday 
strachans lawyer alan mass told judge bruce allen the fact 
that florida has capital punishment played a part in strachans 
decision 
no way if its within our power that mr strachan is going 
back to florida mass told reporters 
the judge ordered strachan held without bail pending a march 14 
hearing 
strachan is married and has three grown children one of them a 
state corrections officer 
milledge was fatally shot nov 1 1946 while on patrol outside 
a football game in miamis overton section after he had chased and 
beaten several teenagers who tried to sneak into the game cadavid 
said 
the case was reopened in july 1989 because of a tip from a 
woman who had seen a youth with a 22caliber rifle running from 
the shooting scene 
the reason she never came forward was because her husband was 
very good friends with the shooter cadavid said the womans 
husband died a few years ago and her conscience was bothering 
her he said 
cadavid and his partner came to new york in january and 
interviewed strachan then returned to miami to build a case 
locating witnesses 
florida doesnt have a statute of limitations on murder

a fire at the tyre king recycling dump in ontario 
continued burning for a fifth day pouring black smoke into air and 
forcing the evacuation of about 600 nearby residents 
ontario taxpayers may end up paying an estimated 1 million to 
clean the damage caused by the fire in hagersville 21 miles 
southwest of hamilton environment minister jim bradley said friday 
bradley said the government may take the owner of tyre king 
recycling to court to force him to pay for cleaning the site which 
contains 12 million to 14 million discarded tires 
but if the owner edward straza is unable to pay taxpayers 
will have to foot the bill 
that is a possibility bradley said but certainly my view 
is the person should assume the entire cost when it comes down to 
how much money that person has thats another determinant 
some environmental experts say the fire could burn for months 
because millions of old tires are fueling the blaze 
the hundreds who have been evacuated from around town home to 
2500 residents will be eligible for compensation from the 
province but the details must still be worked out bradley said 
tyre king ontarios largest tire dump was declared an illegal 
waste site by ministry officials in december 1985 since then 
straza has not applied for a certificate of approval to operate the 
site according to a news report 
straza could not be reached for comment 
environment minister lucien bouchard speaking from ottawa 
rejected an opposition demand that the federal government send 
emergency crews to help fight the fire 
this kind of fire cannot be put out now bouchard said 
friday outside the commons its horrible to say but we dont 
know of any existing means to stop the fire immediately 
the stench was pervasive friday as fog and freezing rain kept 
the smoke hovering low instead of dissipating in the air 
ontario officials said there is no health hazard outside the 
2mile evacuation area surrounding the fire 
about 40 firefighters are working each sixhour shift to combat 
the blaze but two waterbomb planes at the site remained grounded

the longtime livein companion of harold ballard 
owner of the toronto maple leafs has lost her bid to take control 
of the guardianship of the ailing professional hockey magnate 
a judge who had declared ballard 86 mentally incompetent this 
week ruled friday that four guardians recommended by his daughter 
look after the personal and financial affairs of the 
multimillionaire 
i am now certain with the orders made he will be able to live 
in dignity and peace for as long as he needs help said his 
daughter mary elizabeth flynn 
yolanda ballard 57 who lived with harold for most of the 1980s 
and took his last name although they never married lost in the 
latest battle she waged in the courts with his children 
district court judge donna haley appointed former supreme court 
of canada justice willard estey of toronto to look after the 
personal affairs of the owner of the maple leafs and their home 
maple leaf gardens 
named to look after ballards business affairs were gardens 
directors steve stavro and donald giffen and donald crump who 
recently resigned as gardens secretarytreasurer to become 
commissioner of the canadian football league 
it should have been quite clear to yolanda ballard that she 
couldnt be a committee guardian of the person that it had to 
be someone independent of mr ballards estate and his person 
haley said in announcing her ruling 
there is also no evidence before me of her personal 
capabilities of managing an estate as complex as mr ballards 
haley acknowledged yolandas contribution to ballards health 
care but did not grant her free access to the octogenarian who has 
been in a miami hospital for more than a month with kidney and 
heart problems 
yolanda should be allowed to express her concerns and her 
opinions as to mr ballards personal needs and have all access to 
mr ballard as the committees guardians see fit 
yolanda who remained stoic as the judge read her decision 
following three days of hearings refused to say whether she would 
appeal she did however make derogatory remarks about the ballard 
children with whom she has openly feuded for years 
she called ballards sons bill ballard cyclops william and 
flynn medusa mary 
at the eleventh hour everyone comes to jump on harolds 
coffin when hes not even in it yet she said angrily referring 
to ballards children son harold jr was also involved in the 
court action initiated by his sister 
an emotional flynn said in her statement following the 
proceedings she was confident estey would make sure her father got 
the best care possible 
ballard checked into hospital while vacationing with yolanda in 
the cayman islands last month and was later transferred to miami 
baptist hospital suffering from kidney failure he requires 
dialysis three times a week and was listed friday in satisfactory 
condition 
yolandas visits to the miami hospital were restricted after she 
was discovered trying to forcefeed him a banana and jello 
a florida court had appointed a guardian to handle ballards 
affairs until he was well enough to return to toronto the four 
named friday now take over that task 
haley also ruled yolanda should receive 2500 from ballard to 
cover her court costs 
since ballards illness maple leaf gardens has been run by the 
board of directors

the nations finance minister quit 
friday after parliament rejected his proposed inflationfighting 
plan 
the departure of kjellolof feldt from the dayold caretaker 
government appeared to be an attempt by prime minister ingvar 
carlssons longgoverning social democrats to regroup regain 
public confidence and build political support to form a new 
governing coalition 
carlssons government which is to stay on until a new 
government can be formed announced that feldts deputy odd 
engstrom will fill the post 
the prime minister resigned thursday shortly after his 
government lost a vote 190153 on its bill to freeze prices wages 
rents local taxes and corporate dividends for two years the 
package was aimed at bringing inflation under control and stifling 
a wave of labor unrest 
feldt told a news conference he did not have the political 
backing or the personal will to scrap his program and start over 
with the plans i have had i dont have the strength to begin 
afresh to have a new policy i have to hand over to younger and 
better forces he said with carlsson at his side 
asked if the social democrats had an effective alternative to 
the wageprice freeze he said no not today 
in a separate development the bank employees union and the 
bankers association annnounced an end to a threeweek labor 
dispute which had helped prompt the government to draw up its 
politically fatal crisis program 
the two sides accepted a mediation offer of 13 percent wage 
increase and the banks said they would reopen monday 
the speaker of parliament thage g peterson met thursday night 
with opposition leaders on forming a government but the 
centerright parties admitted they had no chance without new 
elections 
political analysts predicted the social democrats would be able 
to reconstitute their government without going into elections by 
gaining support from the small communist party the communists had 
objected to many of feldts policies 
feldt was the architect of swedens recovery in 1982 from a deep 
recession and won international recognition for measures that 
sought to adapt swedens socialist ideology with the free market 
policies of the industrialized west 
feldts moves toward deregulating swedish banking and revamping 
its tax system won praise from the business community and 
nonsocialist opposition parties 
his ideas on privatizing some public services were too radical 
for traditional socialists and set him on a collision course with 
his own party 
feldt credited himself with starting a process of rethinking in 
his party though he said not all of my ideas were politically 
mature 
except for six years from 1976 the social democrats have 
governed sweden since 1932 since returning to office it has ruled 
as a minority government 
opinion polls published before the political uproar began gave 
the social democrats their worst showing in more than 45 years 
with a 34 percent approval rating 
but the three centrist parties which governed in coalition from 
1976 to 1982 also would not gain a majority in a new election the 
polls predicted

cost of assessing environmental damage from last months oil spill 
in a waterway next to the atlantic new jersey and new york 
officials said friday 
also friday exxon workers held a rally in cranford nj to 
support their embattled employer the company has been widely 
criticized both for the local spill and a nearly 11milliongallon 
leak caused by the grounding of the tanker exxon valdez in alaska 
last year 
in a joint announcement new jersey gov jim florio and new york 
gov mario cuomo said state and federal agencies and exxon had 
reached agreement on a preliminary study of damage from the 
567000gallon east coast spill jan 1 and 2 
the oil spewed from a ruptured pipeline into the arthur kill a 
narrow waterway between new jersey and the new york city borough of 
staten island 
exxon must accept full responsibility for this threat to our 
waters wetlands and coastline and it is only fair that they 
provide immediate funding to fully determine the damage caused by 
the oil spill florio said 
officials have criticized exxon for what they say was a slow 
response to spill warning signs and accused the company of 
understating the size of the spill in reports to the coast guard 
but at the employees rally about 100 current and former exxon 
workers and their families met at a restaurant to hear speeches 
criticizing what they called exxon bashing 
were here to stand up and be counted to stop this constant

who has worked for exxon 17 years accidents do happen and we do 
our best to clean them up im proud to say im an employee of 
exxon 
exxon spokesman doug walt said the rally was organized by the 
employees 
about two dozen members of the concerned citizens of linden 
picketed outside the restaurant as the exxon employees entered 
criticizing the companys environmental record 
its such a long bad environmental track record that the 
employees should be as indignant as we are said beatrice 
bernzott concerned citizens president we feel sorry for them 
we know theyre concerned about their jobs but their indignation 
should be directed at their ceos and exxon management

former president reagan known as the great 
communicator went before cameras in a new role friday explaining 
during secret court testimony what he knew about the irancontra 
affair 
reagan smiled and waved but didnt speak to reporters as he 
entered the federal courthouse friday morning to give a videotaped 
deposition in the trial of his former national security adviser 
john poindexter 
i think he was very fair in his testimony poindexter 
attorney richard beckler said of the president afterward 
poindexter goes on trial march 5 on charges of concealing from 
congress oliver norths assistance to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
and lying about a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
poindexter entered the courtroom a few minutes before reagan 
flanked by a halfdozen lawyers and legal aides who had in tow a 
red cart with boxes of documents 
the two exited separately about 6 hours later again ignoring 
shouted questions from the crush of reporters waiting outside 
us district judge harold greene told reporters reagan would be 
questioned again saturday the former chief executive was to return 
to court at 945 am on the beginning of the presidents day 
holiday weekend 
its hard to tell but well be finished by lunch greene 
said when asked how many more questions reagan had to answer 
the public was barred from attending the session during which 
reagan was to answer 154 questions in addition to followups that 
focus on his meetings with poindexter then reagan faced 
crossexamination by irancontra prosecutors 
greene allowed reagan to give videotaped testimony at the 
federal courthouse near his belair area home rather than require 
him to appear in person at the poindexter trial in washington 
three cameras were positioned to record the testimony one 
pointed at reagan one pointed at the judge and the other directed 
at lawyers questioning the former chief executive 
on thursday greene rejected a request by news organizations 
that they be allowed to attend the deposition however he said he 
would order the videotape released within a few days after editing 
to remove material deemed to touch on classified national security 
matters 
three years ago reagan portrayed himself as a president who was 
kept in the dark by his aides but poindexter contends he kept his 
former boss fully informed about all aspects of the affair with 
the apparent exception of the diversion of iran arms sale money to 
the contras and that reagan authorized his activities 
reagan said early in 1987 that he hadnt known about secret 
bank accounts and diverted funds two products of the irancontra 
affair that he said he found personally distasteful he told 
the tower commission he didnt know the national security council 
staff was assisting the contras after congress ordered a halt 
poindexter subsequently told congress he believed reagan 
understood that col north was instrumental in keeping the 
contras supported without maybe understanding the details of 
exactly what he was doing 
fridays questioning according to court papers was to concern 
the presidents knowledge of norths relationship with various 
individuals in the contra operation and the iran initiative 
whether poindexter told reagan of the status of richard secord 
who north enlisted to move supplies to the nicaraguan rebels and 
who operated the network of offshore accounts known as the 
enterprise to move money in the irancontra affair 
reagans discussions with poindexter regarding a chronology on 
a november 1985 hawk shipment that forms the basis of four of the 
five criminal charges against poindexter 
whether reagan advised poindexter to tell congressional 
committees they already had been given information about whether 
north was secretly assisting the contras the earlier responses 
were denials that north was raising money and providing military 
advice to the contras they led to former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlanes guilty plea to criminal charges of withholding 
information from congress

manuel noriega on friday received his first prison 
visit from the red cross since the us government agreed to treat 
the deposed panamanian leader as a prisoner of war 
a doctor and a delegate from the international committee of the 
red cross sought to ensure noriegas treatment was in keeping with 
the geneva convention said jeanmarc bornet the organizations 
chief delegate for latin america 
meanwhile an attorney for noreiga filed a motion in federal 
court asking for the results of wiretaps he claimed were made by 
us invasion troops while noriega was being held in the vatican 
embassy in panama 
we have received information that while the general was in the 
papal nunciature the us army tapped the telephone and recorded 
all the conversations said the attorney frank rubino the 
defense wants to determine if the tapes will help noriegas case 
possibly by showing he was falsely induced to surrender to us 
authorities 
noriega was flown to the united states on jan 4 to face 
drugtrafficking charges he was first housed at the federal 
courthouse but was later moved to a special cell at the federal 
metropolitan correctional center south of miami 
noriegas defense team had demanded that he be treated as a pow 
saying us civilian courts had no jurisdiction over him 
the government agreed to the pow treatment but said he could 
still be prosecuted on the drug trafficking charges us district 
judge william hoeveler concurred last week and ordered the legal 
proceedings to continue 
the geneva conventions are a series of treaties establishing the 
treatment of combatants civilians and prisoners of war 
late friday sources close to the case who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press that rubino and fellow noriega 
attorney steven kollin are scheduled to fly to geneva saturday 
night to discuss noriegas status as a prisoner of war with 
highranking red cross officials 
kollin said he would neither affirm nor deny that the two 
lawyers are going to the swiss capitol when asked by the ap about 
the trip and its purpose 
the details of fridays prison inspection are confidential but 
generally the procedure follows a pattern bornet said 
this first visit is a very traditional task bornet said 
we first of all have a discussion with the manager of the camp or 
prison then we visit all places of detention we see the 
facilities the cells the kitchen 
after the tour and the talks with prison officials the red 
cross meets with the prisoner bornet said 
we have private talks and it is very important that they be 
without witnesses he said we speak only about the conditions 
of detention it may be about food about being allowed to go out 
or to have contact with families or about medical treatment 
there will be followup visits to noriega but there are no set 
intervals and timing will depend on conditions at the prison 
bornet said 
making the inspection were erwin boehi regional delegate for 
the red cross and dr jacques stroun of the agencys medical 
division in geneva switzerland they refused to comment when they 
left the prison late friday afternoon 
they also were to visit three other panamanian prisoners at the 
jail including noriega codefendant luis del cid allegedly once a 
top aide to the deposed leader the red cross refused to identify 
the other two prisoners 
after the inspection the team reports to the red cross and to 
the us government that report is confidential said american red 
cross spokeswoman ann stingle in washington 
if there is a dispute over prison conditions bornet said the 
agency tries to work it out amicably with the host government 
charles davis spokesman for federal prison confirmed the red 
cross visit but said he could not release any information on the 
delegates activities 
bornet said noriegas attorneys have contacted the agency about 
the geneva convention but the visit was routine under an agreement 
the red cross reached with the us government immediately after 
the dec 20 invasion of panama

fed up with months of overcrowding in 
the county jail a sheriff on friday commandeered a national guard 
armory as a temporary prison 
hampden county sheriff michael ashe said he took the action to 
prevent the collapse of the criminal justice system in this county 
due to lack of correctional facilities 
it appears there is an imminent danger of a breach of the 
peace due to insufficient prison space in this county and that 
reasonable and prudent steps must be taken in order to preserve the 
peace and quell such danger ashe said in a directive to the 
brigadier commander of the massachusetts army national guard armory 
here 
the dramatic announcement at 2 pm and the transfer of 15 
prisoners to the armory caught state officials by surprise 
state secretary of public safety charles v barry issued a 
statement saying that ashe had been notified it was illegal to put 
prisoners in the armory he was ordered to have them removed or 
face prosecution for criminal trespass 
this is no way to do business barrys statement said if 
you would come to us to discuss the problem we would see what we 
could do to accommodate you 
barry didnt plan any immediate action saying he would pursue 
necessary legal action tuesday to terminate the unlawful occupation 
of the armory 
the secretary noted that the armory isnt up to code for the 
purpose of housing prisoners and ashe would be responsible for 
their safety 
ashe said in a statement that he believed he acted correctly 
this action is within my inherent power to keep the peace i 
take full responsibility for this action to protect my fellow 
citizens he said 
seventeen minimum security prisoners were taken to the armorys 
drill hall said sheriffs spokesman richard mccarthy describing 
the area as similar to a large gynmasium two of the prisoners were 
later returned mccarthy said adding that all 15 held at the 
armory were prison trustees with less than two months more to serve 
state sen brian lees who went to the armory after hearing the 
news said he wasnt sure whether ashe had the authority to take 
over the building 
were waiting to see if this is legal and whether it falls 
under the guidelines of the constitution he said 
fridays action followed a week of turmoil at the jail 
on wednesday westfield district judge philip contant detained 
two hampden county deputies for most of the day when they refused 
to take a prisoner back to the jail acting on ashes orders 
ashe had refused to return the prisoner because the jail built 
to hold 279 prisoners had exceeded by one a federal order to house 
no more than 500 inmates 
the jail filled up this week and ashes spokesman richard 
mccarthy said the other remedies of early release late sentencing 
and housing prisoners elsewhere in western massachusetts werent 
providing enough spaces 
judge contant said he admired the job ashe has done under trying 
circumstances but he would pursue contempt charges if prisoners 
were turned away from the jail which takes prisoners whose 
sentences are less than 2 years 
a new jail has been approved in nearby ludlow but that is 
expected to take two to three years to build

a bomb planted in an unmarked police car 
exploded thursday killing an undercover narcotics detective in 
front of his home officials said 
dennis wustenhoff 41 died at stony brook university medical 
center nearly three hours after his car blew up just after noon in 
this long island city said hospital spokeswoman maxine simpson 
this was probably an assassination and jobconnected said 
suffolk county police commissioner daniel guido but we dont 
know whether it was revenge or related to a current case wustenhoff 
was working on 
the bomb blew out the entire front part of the latemodel white 
cadillac throwing debris up to 200 feet guido said 
a neighbor who heard the blast ran to the scene and helped pull 
wustenhoff out of the car the commissioner said 
the officer was conscious and answered a question from the 
neighbor about who might have planted the bomb guido said 
refusing to give specifics 
wustenhoff was airlifted to the medical centers burn unit 
where he died 
the bomb was placed either in the engine or under the drivers 
seat guido said it was unclear whether the device exploded when 
wustenhoff started the car or when he sat on the drivers seat 
the car belonged to the police and was being used in undercover 
work said county district attorney james catterson 
guido said the slaying in this suburb on long islands south 
shore more than 70 miles east of new york city was not a 
streetlevel operation it was much higher than that

a man investigated by the fbi in a rash of mail 
bombings across the southeast twice appeared before a federal 
appeals panel on which a slain federal judge served a television 
station reported thursday 
wagatv reported that walter leroy moody jr of rex went before 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in december 1988 to appeal 
the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging malicious prosecution and false 
arrest when he was charged in 1983 with attempted murder 
a panel of the 11th circuit dismissed moodys appeal saying it 
was premature the television station said judge robert s vance 
served on that panel 
officials with the 11th circuit confirmed that moody had gone 
before the court 
on a second appeal in august 1989 moody went before the panel 
which again included vance oral arguments were heard and the case 
is still pending the station reported 
moody was appealing over allegations made during the 1983 case 
in that case he was charged with hiring three georgia divers to 
photograph an underwater propulsion device he planned to market 
then abandoning them in the gulf of mexico jurors were deadlocked 
and the judge declared a mistrial the state decided against 
retrying moody 
vance was killed by a bomb sent to his mountain brook ala 
home dec 16 two days later savannah ga attorney robert 
robinson was killed by a mail bomb two other bombs were sent to 
targets in atlanta and jacksonville fla but intercepted by 
authorities 
investigators have extensively searched the homes and business 
of three men including moody in alabama and georgia though no 
one has been charged in the attacks 
moody a literary consultant was convicted in 1972 in us 
district court in macon of illegal possession of a bomb 
detailed media coverage of the investigation spurred attorneys 
for moody on thursday to ask us district judge richard c freeman 
to issue a gag order to seal all documents in the case and to 
order the return of items confiscated by agents who searched 
moodys home last week 
attorneys for several atlanta news organizations are opposing 
the motions to restrict information about the case 
freeman who said he needed more time to study documents filed 
in the case declined to act on any of the motions he scheduled 
another hearing for wednesday when the judge said well let it 
all hang out 
moodys attorneys argued that the intense publicity over the 
bombs probe has hurt moodys reputation 
but freeman said the media has a right to report whatever 
information it can get from authorities during an investigation

haitian community leaders dismissed 
as racist a new federal policy prohibiting haitians and subsaharan 
africans from donating blood because of the high incidence of aids 
in their home countries 
the policy announced this month by the food and drug 
administration requires blood collection agencies regulated by the 
fda to refuse blood from donors who were born in or emigrated from 
those countries 
the decision is based on the high incidence of africans and 
haitians infected with the aids virus through heterosexual contact 
which seems to play a major role in transmitting the virus 
according to the fda 
we still have the stigma then that we are carriers of aids

they are warriors in a country with more compliant 
consumers than consumer complaints 
fumio matsuda a former auto engineer is a stinging critic of 
the japanese auto industrys safety performance 
katsuko nomura a 79yearold grandmother singlehandedly 
introduced a usstyle consumer movement to japan 
they are anomalies here where social harmony is revered and 
consumers interests have been subordinated to the welfare of 
japanese corporations 
but both have made their mark 
mrs nomura lobbied for local freedom of information laws now 
enacted in 32 of japans 47 prefectures state and about 130 
cities and towns and is working to get a national law on the 
books she believes access to information about such things as 
chemicals in food will galvanize interest in consumers rights 
matsuda operates a volunteer network of scientists and moles at 
japans largest auto companies his 20yearold japan automobile 
consumers union has uncovered defects in cars and shifted the 
spotlight of responsibility onto carmakers contributing to a 
recent unprecedented number of recalls 
matsuda 63 charges japanese automakers have been feeding their 
export success by skimping on safety in domestic models while the 
government sets safety standards that are often too low and fails 
to enforce others 
he claims several carmakers have substituted specially built 
cars in crash tests of new models for the us and japanese 
markets but he adds the models later sold to consumers probably 
would have failed the tests 
matsuda uses the information he gets from scientists conducting 
chemical analyses of engine parts and employees at auto companies 
to help consumers claim damages from allegedly defective cars 
japan has no product liability laws and the lack of legal 
precedent increases the burden on consumers to prove fault by 
automakers 
i never get discouraged because i know were right and that 
our information is correct says matsuda a former engineer at 
the nissan motor co 
he keeps secret the identities of the 25 members of what he 
calls his brain to protect their jobs and his groups 
informationgathering ability they never go to his office and 
rarely call sometimes their wives meet to pass information 
he bristles at the suggestion his network is spying 
they are acting according to their consciences and everybody 
is very proud of what we do 
spokesmen for japans major automakers deny matsudas charges 
and say they do not think their recall records are a problem 
bret anderson a honda spokesman says the company deals 
within the industrys regulations and standards or tries to 
improve on them 
a statement by toyota motor corp said mr matsuda like any 
other socalled advocate owes it to the consumers he supposedly 
represents to be responsible unfortunately his track record to 
date doesnt say much for the sincerity of his implied intentions 
that track record includes a conviction for blackmail stemming 
from charges brought by a group of japans largest automakers in 
1971 they accused matsuda of threatening to publicize information 
about defects in their cars unless they paid him he was sentenced 
to four years of probation 
matsuda maintains he was negotiating for a group of car owners 
who suffered damages from defects and says he is appealing the 
conviction 
although some of japans major media regard matsuda as an 
agitator the national daily asahi shimbun has used his research as 
the basis for many newspaper stories including an awardwinning 
1987 series on sudden acceleration in audi imports the audis were 
recalled later in japan and in the united states 
matsuda lives an austere life on weeknights he sleeps on a cot 
in his tokyo office bulging with files and littered with greasy 
auto parts he sees his wife and two daughters at the familys 
seaside home south of tokyo on weekends 
he and mrs nomura came from affluent families in which charity 
and compassion were taught at an early age 
mrs nomura recalled that when she was studying at kyotos 
prestigious doshisha university in 1931 agricultural families 
were so poor they were selling their daughters while i was being 
taught how to say so nice to meet you in english class 
sensitive to the gap between the real world and the privileged 
one of her birth she ignored english read books on marxism and 
social injustice and married a likeminded classmate 
soon afterward she launched a 59year career of consumer 
advocacy that has included organizing labor unions and bringing 
news of consumer movements to japan 
the japanese people just dont get mad at manufacturers 
theyre not concerned with their rights she said so i get 
angry for them

fancy apartments and shops on sablon square 
brussels sparkles for europe counters a billboard on the 
square where furcoated customers buy pastries at what has become 
the citys priciest bakery or frequent fancy expresso bars 
restaurants and antique shops 
near the eec headquarters old homes have been bulldozed to make 
way for new offices and a 231 million convention center 
all this at a price 
you cannot throw out residents like a pile of bricks said 
the rev jacques van der biest a roman catholic priest and a 
leader of the marolles protests against sacrificing residents to 
urban renewal 
but as 1992 fever grips brussels social considerations are 
overwhelmed by real estate speculation 
last fall the happy babies nursery in central brussels got a 
surprise eviction notice the owner who had just bought the 
building wanted to sell it for a quick profit 
finding no other premises at 550 monthly rent it was paying 
the nursery went into debt to buy the building a happy babies 
official said the owner made a 35000 profit in about a month 
now we have to spend double to pay off she said we dont 
stop talking about money now the future looks very bleak 
pensioners have been forced out of their apartments to make way 
for middleincome families who can no longer afford rents in their 
old neighborhoods 
the market is set to tighten even more despite a decree 
limiting rent increases to inflation for the next year 
we will have a battle between the haves and havenots for the 
available homes said herve cnudde head of the urban 
conservation group arau it is already the no 1 issue in 
brussels social and political circles 
apartments that fetched 250amonth in rent in 1987 now are 
double that in some neighborhoods 
the blame is laid on the eec its 12000 wellpaid eurocrats 
who get tax breaks locals do not get and its 1992 plan which 
will lure even more eurocrats and lobbyists to this city of just 
under a million people 
in addition to the eurocrats brussels already has 20000 
lobbyists and 800 international trade organizations in operation 
foreigners can spend a lot more on housing than locals 
cnudde said 
when owners demand big rent increases many locals opt to move 
some as far off as antwerp or charleroi both 30 miles out 
in the end there will be more foreigners than bruxellois 
said jacqueline godfroid a director at the office of property 
owners 
currently some 25 percent of brussels population is foreign 
including many lowincome immigrants from north africa 
foreign investors however find brussels is still a bargain 
despite the increased real estate values 
over the last two years a lot of people came in to buy 
scandinavians swiss recently more japanese and americans because 
they realize the potential of the open market of 1992 said 
godfroid 
increasingly she added they paid crazy prices for even 
dilapidated real estate 
van der biest the priest said a house near his marolles church 
that would have fetched less than 100000 a few years ago was 
valued recently at almost a million dollars 
serious traffic congestion also has developed because of the 
construction of the new office complex and conference center in an 
already congested area of narrow oneway streets 
it is simply not made for such implantations said cnudde 
they decided on the site before thinking about the consequences 
it is the world turned around

author bryna fireside has three children all 
were out of high school by age 16 
her daughter leela started college at 15 douglas graduated at 
16 and got a job daniel also finished at 16 and went to 
california so what happened to tradition why didnt they just 
graduate after 12th grade and go straight to college 
first of all theyre three unusual kids bright and 
nonconformist who followed their parents encouragement to live a 
little differently take chances and break a few rules if necessary 
also as fireside points out in choices a student survival 
guide for the 1990s 1095 garrett park press the rules have 
changed options for high school students are broader and more 
accessible than even she considered possible 
if you dont have a good reason for being there you shouldnt 
be in college said fireside a freelance writer and supervisor 
of student teachers at cortland state college its an expensive 
proposition that can really be a marvelous experience if you know 
what it is youre after 
there are so many things kids can do by spending a year away 
by the time they get to college they at least know what they dont 
want they know its hard to make friends in a work place at a low 
level job for kids who travel and are willing to take that step in 
another part of the world that can also be an eyeopener 
fireside had written magazine articles about high school 
students who stop out take time off before college and also 
researched internship programs and summer schools 
the students impressed her and so did the parents for adults 
choices is a friendly arm around the shoulder from an 
experienced mother and writer the message relax trust your child 
i was talking to someone in a large suburban area and i 
mentioned i had written about stopping out between high school 
and college one parent said what if she never decides to go to 
college 
if parents value education the kids will also value 
education thats a very hard concept for parents to accept a lot 
of parents think if they dont guide the kids all the way if they 
let them step out of the mold all will be lost people mature at 
different rates we ought to be able to recognize it in teens 
choices could be called the conceptual guide to continuing 
education structured like a school workbook fireside leaves 
plenty of room in the margins for notes and comments and includes 
dozens of organizations to contact 
call it pop education as well important ideas available to all 
theres a lot of information out there but its not readily 
accessible to kids a lot of guidance counselors dont have 
information either or the kids dont feel comfortable with 
guidance counselors 
the information doesnt seem to be in the bookstores its a 
nice thin book 111 pages and easy to read 
fireside includes chapters on internships travel and jobs 
programs she also discusses the military a sensitive topic for a 
longtime activist who once organized the antinuclear tasteful 
ladies for peace but choices means all choices and for 
millions the military is a serious option 
it is a very important part of american life for those kids 
that feel theres something they can contribute to their country 
this is a good way to do it and get a free education but the 
object of the military is not to educate but to teach how to 
kill 
education fireside noted can be resumed at any time and not 
only the young take chances the most exciting time of her own life 
came in her 40s when she went back to school creating a degree in 
childrens literature at cornell university 
fireside continues to be challenged by her own children 
especially by daniel who at 19 is spending his junior year of 
college in peru and hasnt hesitated to get involved in that 
countrys turbulent politics 
even when i didnt agree with what my kid was doing it was 
very exciting seeing my kid doing something he likes doing she 
said we all want our kids to be productive and think more about 
other things than just themselves 
many of the kids i talked to were not rebels but pretty 
bright kids who just had something else they wanted to do what im 
basically saying is that you dont have to plan out your whole 
life you can just plan six months

it is not every night you see a man give birth 
but its happening tonight by golly on where else alien 
nation 
this shows how far tv has progressed since little rickys 
arrival on i love lucy in 1953 for starters lucy who gave 
birth to ricky didnt have to chase bad guys and get punched in 
the beak to induce the blessed event 
but she was neither a male plainclothes cop nor a newcomer as 
they call the aliens with the melonshaped heads on this fox 
network series detective george francisco eric pierpoint is both 
in last weeks episode his pregnant wife michele scarabelli 
transferred her tykeinprogress to georges innards you see it 
is the newcomer custom for men to endure the miserable last stages 
of pregnancy and to give birth 
this may not strike earthmen as a particularly good deal be 
that as it may tonights chapter also has police work facing 
george and his human partner matt gary graham 
they must track down a nogood who is selling a brace of 
bodybuilders a deadly addictive steroidlike drug made from 
essence of newcomer newcomer men are far stronger than human 
males 
but the main theme of the episode real men is what it 
means to be a man and in its reexamination of conventional male 
and female roles we get a fresh definition of what some call the 
new man 
the old definition a guy who isnt afraid to drink perrier or 
let his date pick up the check 
as do pregnant earthlings george suffers swollen ankles an 
aching back and fears his mate has eyes for others he also hears a 
succession of bad pregnancy jokes that brings him understandably 
to tears 
but he doesnt quite catch on when matt tries to enlighten him 
about the concept of macho about how males are raised to be tough 
to shun tears and play football on knees so scarred they resemble 
beaver hors doeuvres 
george tries though ah he says like some newcomer men 
they dont feel truly masculine until theyve given birth 
he cant understand why earthmen worry so much about impotency 
though 
such talk fuddles matt and while hes extremely sympathetic 
about his friends delicate condition its awkward for him that 
george heavy with alien insists on staying on the job until his 
time has come 
its equally awkward that a visiting playboy pal nick shockley 
puts the moves on matts lovely newcomer neighbor cathy terri 
treas even though its only a subplot matt gets jealous 
all this is told in a droll if slightly leaden manner with the 
finale offering a rousing latenight fight that pits the two 
constables against a drugcrazed weightlifter the fight causes 
george to go into labor prematurely 
lying down on the floor gasping for breath he tells his 
frantic partner put your fists against my temples it helps 
dilate the pouch 
will the babe be boy or girl when it takes its first breath 
will it emit a tiny cry of nanonano or demand to be 
interviewed by geraldo rivera find out for yourself 
and remember this is not the arrival of little ricky but if 
you do get bored put your fists against your temples it helps 
dilate the mind

the winner of sundays 
presidential election not only has to bring peace but make life 
better for people like liliana perez a teacher whose salary of a 
million cordobas a month is worth only 18 
or the housewife who has to pay 1000 cordobas for a single 
tortilla and 15000 for a pound of beans 
or the worker whose salary has steadily deteriorated the past 10 
years as ms perezs has 
pumping life back into one of the poorest economies in the 
western hemisphere most likely will be a crucial agenda item either 
for the incumbent daniel ortega and his sandinistas or violeta 
barrios de chamorros of the united national opposition the main 
challenger 
everything will be better the sandinistas promised in their 
campaign slogan 
uno can change things said the opposition 
says liliana perez we are not political but we are convinced 
that this nonsense has got to change 
she spoke after school as she helped her mother sell fruit 
drinks from a roadside stand to shore up the family budget 
san rafael del sur about 25 miles southwest of managua became 
a focus of discontent last year when teachers started a series of 
wildcat strikes to protest a standard of living that has plunged 
under 10 years of sandinista rule 
ms perez who is in her early 20s and said she will vote for 
uno because of low wages few jobs high food prices and 
sandinistadominated labor unions which she described as party 
cheerleaders instead of worker advocates 
real wages have retained only 10 percent of their value since 
the sandinistas toppled dictator anastasio somoza in july 1979 
the sandinistas acknowledge they have made mistakes but blame 
most of nicaguas problems on a us commercial embargo the civil 
war with the usbacked contra rebels and 1988 destruction by 
hurricane joan 
their critics say the sandinistas imposed an inefficient 
centralized economy and disastrous fiscal policies permitted bad 
administration and rampant corruption and showed little tolerance 
for opponents 
the critics also maintain that sandinista policies have been 
supported by charity from the cuba and the old soviet bloc 
charity they say will disappear now with the collapse of communism 
in eastern europe 
both sides in the races for the presidency a new national 
assembly and municipal offices seem in agreement that they must 
work together after the winners are declared 
in the first place it is necessary to start an economic 
reconstruction of the country vice president sergio ramirez said 
in a recently published interview for that it is necessary to 
think first of a concordance of all the social forces after the 
elections 
apart from agreeing that cooperation is crucial the sandinistas 
have not come out with a clear program on how they will achieve the 
increased production needed to bankroll an array of social projects 
their opponents also know cooperation is vital to the country 
but keep pushing their demands for a tropical perestroika as 
some of them put it as a condition for that cooperation 
there is no sense in us making a concordance or an economic 
pact under current conditions said gilberto cuadra president of 
the council of private enterprise nicaraguas most influential 
consortium of private business 
the system in itself doesnt make any sense anymore either 
here or in cuba or in eastern europe 
in january the business council which backs mrs chamorro 
made a series of proposals that strike at the heart of the 
sandinista economic system 
among the most important points the document calls for 
establishing trust between government and private enterprise and 
doing away with centralized state planning of the economy 
but alejandro martinez minister of planning and budget said 
the banking system and foreign trade will continue as nationalized 
sectors of the economy run by the central government something 
that left businessmen shaking their heads in frustration 
relations between the leftist government and private enterprise 
have not visibly improved in the last year 
in may the government confiscated three large coffee farms when 
their owners criticized government policies 
a few weeks ago in a campaign speech president ortega 
threatened to confiscate a cooking oil processing factory he had 
accused the factorys manager a relative of mrs chamorro of 
causing a cooking oil scarcity to hurt the government shortly 
after ortegas speech the government announced it was importing 
several tons of soybeans to make cooking oil 
mr ortega couldnt hide his totalitarian instincts and he 
decided to make a show of whos boss cuadra remarked when asked 
about the incident

a new sandinista government would be operating under 
circumstances radically different from those of 10 years ago 
ortega returned from a 10nation european trip last april with 
only 50 million in promises for aid and that was before communist 
governments began falling apart in the east 
with eastern europe now ready to absorb the financial good will 
of western europe and a strapped soviet union reluctant to continue 
handouts the sandinistas will not be able to rely on foreign 
donations estimated to have averaged 400 million a year 
international lending organizations heavily influenced by the 
united states seem to be one of the few lifesavers left for the 
sandinistas but those loans will be forthcoming only if a 
sandinista government seems serious about righting the economy and 
if it manages to persuade the united states the elections were 
fair regardless of the outcome 
at the beginning of 1989 ortega announced a stringent economic 
austerity program that slashed the public budget by nearly half and 
called for the firing of at least 30000 public employees 
the aim was to rein in inflation that had shot up to a world 
record of 33600 percent in 1988 according to government figures 
inflation was down to a 1700 percent annual rate by the end of 
1989 
however the government has refused to say how many people were 
actually laid off and some economists say the inflation rate is 
higher than 1700 percent because the cost of a basket of staples 
like beans and rice has risen 5000 percent 
the sandinistas continued mass subsidies to a plethora of 
workers and some public employees notably those of the interior 
ministry received hefty raises 
uno would seem to have an easier though by no means easy time 
in starting up the economy 
for one thing the united states most certainly would lift the 
commercial embargo it imposed on the sandinista government in 1985 
that would bring in us aid and foreign loans to restart 
production and a large and profitable market for nicaraguas 
traditional agricultural export crops 
a usbacked government especially one that projects 
stability also would have an easier time attracting foreign 
investment 
but to achieve that stability uno would have to gain the 
cooperation of the sandinistas in order to avert strikes by 
sandinistadominated labor unions that could thwart any economic 
effort 
when the sandinistas started their antiinflation program last 
year hundreds of teachers nationwide went on wildcat strikes for 
higher pay following the lead of san rafael de sur teachers in 
defiance of their prosandinista labor union 
that and strikes by cab drivers brought the sandinistas 
facetoface with their first serious labor unrest 
ortega gave pay raises to the teachers and subsidies to the 
cabbies but those gains were soon eroded by inflation 
what they have done to us is too much said ms perez i 
cant forget that 
even those who say they will vote sandinista are counting on 
brighter days ahead 
if theyre elected the war will end then well have to 
demand that the economy gets better said ambrosio sanchez 26 
who weaves hammocks with his wife josefa in masaya near managua 
what if the economy doesnt improve 
well have to see he said somberly looking at his wife and 
his 4yearold son barebottomed and barefoot playing in the dirt

if wall street were a western movie people could 
call the sheriff to corral rustlers who ride off with corporate 
gold instead of putting it into research and updated plants needed 
to compete 
thats basically what michigan state university economics 
professor walter adams urges in dangerous pursuits a recently 
published book on the 1980s mania for mergers and takeovers that in 
light of recent events seems prophetic 
dodge city needs a sheriff to maintain law and order to break 
up the brawls and to restore sanity to its inhabitants so does 
wall street he and coauthor james w brock conclude in a 
chapter on cowboy capitalism 
the kind of deals that characterized the 1980s kept 
entrepreneurs from creating new wealth new jobs and increased 
competitiveness they argue in the book a rash of financial crises 
and bankruptcies at companies that expanded using highrisk junk 
bond debt is one of the consequences 
these are jerrybuilt structures basically adams said in 
an interview they are a prime example of excessive speculation 
the warnings in the book were underscored this past week when 
the oncemighty wall street pioneer of the junk bondfinanced 
takeover business sought bankruptcy protection itself few believe 
drexel burnham lambert inc will survive and many say the era of 
unbridled junk financing is probably over 
mergers and acquisitions are the dangerous pursuits adams 
and brock a miami university of ohio economics professor describe 
in the book published by pantheon books in new york 
the two previously wrote the bigness complex on the 
influence of power groups in the us economy the book was named 
one of the top 10 business books of 1987 by business week magazine 
brainpower focused on wheeling and dealing for profit could be 
used better to improve us companies productivity or 
competitiveness or to cut public and private debt that weighs down 
the economy adams said 
managers get into deep and unfamiliar waters when preoccupied by 
mergers whether theyre the hunter or the hunted he said 
the book quotes esmark creator donald p kelly as saying his 
company did everything from drilling for oil to selling meat and 
manufacturing bras and all it tells you is that you can be head 
of a holding company and not be very smart about anything 
adams said unfamiliarity was a reason campeau corps 260store 
retailing empire owner of burdines lazarus jordan marsh 
bloomingdales and other wellknown chains wound up in bankruptcy 
court seeking to reorganize and repay more than 7 billion in debts 
robert campeau went far afield when he bought allied for 36 
billion in 1986 and federated for 66 billion in 1988 adams said 
hes a real estate operator from canada buying two major retail 
store chains in the united states 
campeau used junk financing that cost him more than 16 percent 
interest on much of the debt he financed it with junk bonds 
which you might call the fake wampum of the 1980s adams said 
among adams and brocks suggestions to divert corporate 
brainpower and resources into constructive avenues 
end tax deductions for the interest on debt incurred simply to 
transfer corporate control 
put a sliding tax on capital gains from sales of assets high 
if the assets are held a short time low if they are held longer 
enforce antitrust laws the clayton act prohibits mergers or 
acquisitions that lessen competition or create a monopoly

theres something appropriate about 
hasbro incs new line featuring new kids on the block its the 
first venture that smacks of alan hassenfeld since he became the 
new man in charge 
hassenfeld labored for years in the shadow of his older brother 
stephen his brothers death of pneumonia last june at age 47 
however thrust hassenfeld into the limelight as chairman and chief 
executive officer 
although the younger hassenfeld had worked in the company in 
various capacities for two decades including president since 1984 
there were some who doubted his credentials 
they wondered whether his experience as head of the 
international division had prepared him to run the nations largest 
toy company but as hasbro touts its 1990 products at the annual 
toy fair in new york the reports are that he is doing fine 
in an interview during the toy trade show this week hassenfeld 
said several of hasbros toys making their debut demonstrate that 
the company can respond quickly to what consumers want 
i think new kids very definitely is a fascinating new 
introduction for us something that we had not been doing much of 
in the past he said of the line of dolls and accessories based 
on the popular singing group 
berlin wall commemorative puzzles from hasbros milton bradley 
division also illustrate the companys responsiveness he said 
i think its very important that we be very topical it just 
shows that we can move and move very quickly 
industry analysts and hasbro insiders say that by going after a 
licensing pact with a hot group such as the new kids hasbro 
signaled a new approach to doing business 
i think a few years ago hasbro might not have picked up a 
license like new kids on the block thats something alan has 
accomplished to his tribute said al verrecchia one of hasbros 
chief operating officers 
alan is putting his mark on the company very quickly 
signaling that he is going to very aggressively manage it for 
growth in the 1990s said paul valentine an analyst with 
standard amp poors corp 
the promotional side of the business had suffered in recent 
years he said the company as was the case with other large 
toy companies had become more bureaucratic and less innovative 
some critics had faulted hasbro in the past for resting on its 
laurels and relying too heavily on classics like gi joe my 
little pony and the game of life 
alan is willing to try something thats unorthodox and 
innovative valentine said 
another thing hassenfeld has been able to do is squelch the 
takeover rumors that surfaced after his brothers death 
the odds of a takeover have sharply been reduced by the 
passage of time and the fact that alan is very aggressively 
assuming control of the company valentine said 
hassenfeld said he has no intentions whatsoever about moving 
away from this business 
a 41yearold with a boyish sense of fun and a disarming smile 
hassenfeld expressed devotion to the company founded by his 
grandfather henry as hassenfeld brothers in 1923 
the founding hassenfeld family owns 131 percent of hasbros 
stock and has effective voting control over another 136 percent 
when stephen hassenfeld became chairman in 1980 the company 
which also is parent of the playskool division had 1023 million 
in revenue last year revenue grew to 141 billion from 136 
billion in 1988 and earnings were up 27 percent to 92 million from 
72 million 
hassenfeld who studied creative writing at the university of 
pennsylvania seems to genuinely like what hes doing 
ive lived and died this business for over 21 years its in 
my blood and i love it he saidwhat other business could i be 
in that part of the day i can honestly be that sevenyearold

it and i could say i was producttesting or something

an east german company that has 
purchased a us distributor of printing machines says it will 
outhustle capitalist competitors to improve the companys sales 
as western businessmen stream to the east bloc looking for 
investments the stateowned polygraph exportimport co has gone 
west making east germanys first us acquisition 
the west german bank that loaned polygraph 25 million for the 
deal says americans would be surprised by the entrepreneurial drive 
of citizens long ruled by hardline communists 
if this deal is successful and im certain it will be it 
could be just the start of a series of such ventures here said 
arnold schlappig general manager of the new york branch of 
bayerische hypotheken und weschselbank or hypobank 
the guys who did this deal are very openminded 
internationally oriented businessmen who understand capitalism 
schlappig said other east german companies just need an 
additional injection and they could export tomorrow 
polygraph which exports machinery from five east german 
companies said it bought royal zenith inc its us distributor 
to improve sales and technological ties with american businesses 
the price was not disclosed the companys name has since been 
changed to planeta north america inc 
frank an east german manager who is vice president of the new 
company said the political changes in his country hastened the 
deal 
the negotiations began while communist hardliner erich honecker 
was still in power in east germany but seifert said there was less 
paperwork after honecker was ousted oct 18 and democratic 
reformers took over opened the berlin wall brought noncommunists 
into the government and promised elections 
we were hoping for a long time that this development would 
happen said at company headquarters in a hillside industrial 
park just east of new york city 
lets say some of my dreams politically and professionally 
were realized by this 
seiffert 49 a former salesman of computers and photocopiers 
is one of two east germans among 150 employees at the company 
which expects sales of 50 million this year 
several members of the new us management team are former 
executives of royal zenith who had left the company in recent 
years among them is the former company president allan malachuk 
who takes his old post 
after rumors of a sale and low morale among workers for several 
years theres an opendoor policy here again said operations 
manager jeffrey post who has been with the company for 14 years 
he said the german representatives are interested in making more 
contacts with us graphics art companies to help improve designs 
of their printing machines and increase sales 
in recent years we had sort of an adversarial relationship 
with the east german factories their government was a problem 
back then and it was difficult to exchange even things like 
blueprints and work documents 
the companys main competitors are japanese and west german 
manufacturers which pay less than 4 percent in duties on imported 
machinery compared to the 10 percent charged east germany 
perhaps in america you should have a certain perestroika 
said seiffert using the soviet term for economic restructuring to 
refer to us tariff policy 
the bush administration has said it will make changes in trade 
policy after east german elections march 18 
seiffert said several investment and financing companies have 
asked him for ideas on east german acquisitions 
he said he is not fearful that western investors will dominate 
or exploit east germany 
polygraph in 1988 accounted for 40 million of east germanys 
130 million in exports to the united states polygraphs 
associated printing companies have pioneered technological changes 
in the industry said bob mckinney a former royal zenith executive 
who became vice president for marketing after the acquisition 
post said the sale might have aroused suspicion among royal 
zenith employees when east germany was a strict communist state 
but not now 
i think a big part of the resistance is gone the wall has 
come down he said now that theyre changing to the american 
system theres no problem its just two guys doing business

tom ward recalled reading the label on a 
perrier bottle after he detected traces of the toxic chemical 
benzene in the bubbly water 
the label said it had been bottled since 1863 said ward 
the environmental lab director for mecklenburg county 
i pondered over that for a few minutes they are practically 
an institution like coke in this country but never in my mind was 
there any thought of not telling someone 
we checked our results very closely he said once we 
made the call to the fda we were 100 percent sure there was no 
doubt whatsoever 
perrier isnt regarded lightly at the lab indeed technicians 
there use the french sparkling water as a purity standard against 
which they test 25000 water samples a year so when benzene was 
found in six bottles with the same lot number last month ward 
notified federal officials and sent them two unopened bottles from 
the same batch 
sure enough the food and drug administration found traces of 
the cancercausing chemical in both bottles 
wards findings have turned out to be a multimilliondollar 
headache for the french bottler which has decided to dump 160 
million bottles at an estimated cost of 35 million 
we felt a lot of responsibilty a weight on our 
shoulders said ward a 19year county employee nevertheless 
when we let it out we knew it was the right decision 
earlier this week about 72 million bottles of perrier were 
withdrawn from the us market based on the tests in wards lab 
the recall since has spread to 120 countries around the world 
thad wester north carolinas deputy health director called the 
move primarily a business decision 
to put it in perspective the risks were not all inordinately 
great he said of the chances of anyone getting cancer from 
drinking the water what he did was what any responsible 
scientist would do he recognized something was wrong and instead 
of just forgetting about it he did something 
ward sympathized with the economic hardship the disclosure has 
caused for the french company which is yanking shipments in 120 
countries 
i have concerns about that but im also concerned about the 
benzene in the water he said those concerns are greater to me 
than the financial problems it causes perrier 
in paris perrier officials said some shipments of the bottled 
water were contaminated by a dirty filter at the companys 
underground spring in vergeze france the filter is designed to 
remove naturally occurring benzene from the carbon dioxide gas that 
gives perrier its distinctive bubble 
it was complete negligence said the companys managing 
director frederik zimmer who added that the workers involved had 
been disciplined 
importers have been advised to dump the bottles of the water on 
site and return the bottles to the company for cleaning and 
refilling 
the decision is expected to disrupt distribution for about three 
months 
ward said the company was not overreacting 
i dont think it poses an imminent health problem but why 
take any additional risks he said i think theyre acting in 
the right way 
as for his staffs actions ward said they performed admirably 
i think we did a good job he said we do this kind of 
testing on surface water every day when we find contamination we 
report it but it usually doesnt cause such a stir

profitsharing checks for more than a 
halfmillion general motors corp and ford motor co employees will 
be significantly lower this spring because of a sagging us auto 
market 
no one at chrysler corp will receive profitsharing payments 
because the company didnt make enough money in the united states 
last year chrysler workers got an average of 720 each in 1988 
the dramatic drop in profitsharing is yet another piece of 
evidence that the us auto industry is in recession 
on thursday gm reported a 50 percent decline in fourthquarter 
earnings and ford said its profits for the period plunged 729 
percent earlier in the week chrysler said it lost 664 million in 
the final three months of 1989 
the declines reflected stagnating sales and the high costs of 
incentives including cash rebates and lowinterest financing 
plans automakers said they were giving away up to 1000 to sell 
each car at the end of last year 
profitsharing figures are based in part on the profitability 
of the companies us automotive operations for the past several 
years gm and ford have been relying on overseas earnings to help 
prop up the corporations profits chrysler has few overseas 
operations 
ford plans this afternoon to release the amount of its 
profitsharing payments for about 150000 hourly and salaried 
employees on thursday ford treasurer david mccammon said it would 
be substantially less than last years average payment of 2800 
annual profits from fords us automotive operations which 
serve as a base for profitsharing declined 38 percent in 1989 
mccammon said 
gm officials said its 443000 eligible hourly and salaried 
workers would get about 50 each in profitsharing payments next 
month 
last year gm employees got an average of 265 in profitsharing 
news of the sharply lower profitsharing came seven months 
before the united auto workers contracts with the big three expire 
it blackens the cloud over the talks already darkened by plant 
closings and temporary and indefinite layoffs which are likely to 
make job security the top issue when negotiations open in july 
the fact is that uaw workers have given the most effort and 
attention to rebuilding gms strength where it counts the most on 
the shop floor said stephen yokich head of the uaws gm 
department they are not responsible for gms costly blunders 
including its repeated failures to understand and target a rapidly 
changing vehicle market 
gm earned 7002 million in the quarter ended dec 31 or 101 
a share compared with 14 billion or 212 a share in the same 
period of 1988 
ford posted profits of 314 million or 68 cents a share 
compared with 116 billion or 242 a share a year earlier 
fords earnings declined largely because of a 424 million loss 
linked to the sale of its rouge steel co subsidiary but even 
without that factor earnings were down 363 percent 
for the entire year gm earned 422 billion down 132 percent 
from 1988 fords earnings fell 276 percent to 384 billion last 
year 
together big three profits in 1989 were 842 billion 249 
percent lower than the year before 
incentives took big bites from each of the companys earnings 
especially in the fourth quarter they could continue to take a big 
bite out of profits in the current quarter especially for 
chrysler incentives were on during all of january for the 
companys popular minivans which boosted sales of light truck 
sales but cost the company in the meantime 
mccammon said ford spent an average of 800 in incentives for 
every car and truck it sold in the fourth quarter slightly more 
than double what ford spent a year earlier 
and by the end of the quarter ford was spending about 1000 on 
incentives for each of its vehicles 
theyre as high as they ever have been he said but added 
that as production and inventory levels come back into line the 
need for incentives will decline 
gm declined to say what its incentive costs were in the fourth 
quarter but officials said the company spent about 800 per 
vehicle during the entire year up about 100 from 1988 it was 
likely that because of heavier use of incentives toward the end of 
the year gm spent more than 800 a vehicle in the fourth quarter 
chrysler spokesman tom houston said the company does not 
disclose incentive costs but it is likely that the costs werent 
much different from gms or fords

junk bond traders knew the end was near when the 
art came off the walls at drexel burnham lambert incs famous 
beverly hills calif office 
the investment house made famous by michael milken began closing 
up shop in new york and los angeles on thursday drexel said 
several thousand of the firms 5300 workers would get the ax today 
in addition to taking down artwork employees said drexel 
changed the locks on some doors and stationed guards in lobbies to 
prevent workers from walking off with computers sensitive 
documents and other materials that material presumably could be 
sold as wall streets expowerhouse liquidates 
some employees were angry others resigned still others eager 
to move on after three years of turmoil at the firm credited with 
altering american finance with the junk bond a highrisk 
highyield piece of debt that let some small companies grow and 
others mount successful raids on corporate titans 
drexels parent company filed for bankruptcy protection tuesday 
in new york after defaulting on 100 million in shortterm debt 
drexel blamed its demise on a capital shortage created in part by a 
decline in the junk bond market an erosion of confidence in the 
firm didnt help either 
the offers are pouring in joked joe bencivenga codirector 
of highyield research in beverly hills where milken moved the 
junk bond division in 1978 drexel said it was terminating the bulk 
of the divisions 400 employees today 
bencivenga said professionals in the division located at the 
corner of wilshire boulevard and rodeo drive in a building owned by 
milken and some partners were banding together in search of 
employment 
there are a lot of individuals a bunch of splinter groups 
they form they dissipate they form its an active molecular 
structure he said 
people are cleaning out their stuff typing their resumes and 
using the fax machine and phones extensively he added i dont 
think theres any offers yet theres a lot of interest its only 
been one day 
on wall street firms were inundated with resumes and calls from 
soontobe exdrexel employees drexel was seeking to transfer 
whole departments to other firms for free as part of its unwinding 
bencivenga who has been with drexel since 1985 when the firm 
was at its heyday was optimistic in the face of unemployment 
i look at it as a major opportunity he said its not 
very often in life you get to stop what youre doing and start 
anew 
some employees were angry about the frequent pleas by drexel 
chief executive frederick joseph over the last three years to stand 
by the firm as it took a public flogging during the governments 
lengthy insider trading investigation 
josephs pep talks were said to have boosted morale when drexel 
hit its lowest ebb last year pleading guilty to six felonies and 
agreeing to pay 650 million to settle civil and criminal fraud 
charges rather than face a racketeering indictment that could have 
crippled the firm instantly 
there was a very high price to the loyalty we paid these 
guys said a drexel research analyst in new york who asked not to 
be named we stayed and stayed and stayed it seems at the end 
the reason the company went under is just a simple assetliability 
problem who was running the show 
others were bitter that drexel didnt warn its employees the end 
was near the net worth of many drexel workers who own 54 percent 
of the stock in the privately held parent company may have 
evaporated with the bankruptcy filing because stockholders 
typically stand at the end of the bankruptcy line 
those people arent going to get paid anything now because the 
stock is worthless said a longtime drexel executive who left the 
firm recently people could have been finding jobs out there in a 
normal period of time its just very poor management 
the junk bond division was altered drastically by milkens 
criminal problems he quit the firm last june after his 98count 
indictment but had been working only parttime for close to a year 
under milkens forceful and wellconnected leadership drexel 
drummed up business seemingly at will and junk bonds generated 
large majority of the firms profits that changed after his 
departure though drexel still controlled 386 percent of junkbond 
underwriting in 1989 
said bencivenga that was a whole different era that was a 
whole different controversy

whittle communications has signed 2510 schools 
to threeyear contracts and has sold 200 million in advertising 
for its commercially sponsored channel one news program for the 
classroom debuting march 5 
christopher whittle chairman of knoxville tennbased media 
company said thursday the schools have agreed to show the daily 
12minute news program which is tailored to teens and includes two 
minutes a day of commercials 
he said the ad contracts also cover three years including about 
65 million in the first year that amounts to about twothirds of 
the revenue that the company hopes to earn from channel one ad 
sales 
at a news conference whittle said the program will be seen in 
400 schools with 300000 students on the launch date and that 1000 
schools should be showing it by the end of march 
whittle said the number of participating schools will rise each 
week as the company installs television monitors and other 
equipment he said was confident of reaching his goal of signing 
7000 to 8000 schools with six million students by december those 
signed to date are in 34 states 
whittle declined to identify any of the schools or sponsors 
the program has provoked critics who charge it is wrong for 
schools to hand over a captive audience to a commercial enterprise 
selling access to makers of soap candy or other products 
the cable television industry has responded by developing 
commercialfree programs for use in the classroom turner 
broadcasting systems incs cable news network for instance has 
been running a daily 15minute news program tailored to teens since 
august 
bert carp an executive at turner said more than 7000 schools 
have enrolled to use the show called cnn newsroom and said its 
surveys showed more than half of them are actively using the 
program 
but whittle contends that schools are illequipped to make use 
of those programs and that a survey conducted for his company 
indicated virtually none of 1500 students contacted by telephone 
at home indicated they had seen a news program in school whittle 
blamed a lack of tv sets in classrooms 
schools that agree to show the channel one program to their 
students get television monitors for every classroom a satellite 
dish and two videocassette recorders the school keeps the 
equipment only as long as it runs the show 
in addition to the daily news show schools are permitted to use 
the equipment for noncommercial programming including specials 
that are being made available from public television for use in the 
schools 
whittle was accompanied at the news conference by former us 
education secretary terrell h bell who heads a committee of 
educators advising channel one and others 
the company also said it awarded a 900000 grant to the 
university of michigans institute for social research and the firm 
interwest applied research to study channel ones contribution to 
education over the next three years 
state education officials in california and new york have banned 
channel one from their public schools whittle said he expected to 
meet his goals without public schools from either state 
cynthia kalish samuels a former planning producer for nbcs 
today show was named executive producer of the channel one 
staff in october and has assembled a staff to produce stories for 
the program 
she said one featured topic in the first week of programs will 
be the ramifications of the fall of the berlin wall while 
subsequent weeks will have five daily segments on drugs south 
africa and the summer job outlook

it was a perfect day to begin spring 
training a sea breeze was blowing toward right field the sun cast 
crisp shadows the air was sweet with citrus and freshly trimmed 
grass 
but there was no crack of the bat no ring of the cash register 
its kind of weird isnt it dodgertown ticket manager olive 
maiher said thursday everything should be coming to life and 
instead its just nothing 
outside the empty ticket counter and souvenir stand a man in 
sunglasses was taking a nap 
since 1949 vero beach has been decking itself in dodger blue to 
welcome their major league heros from los angeles 
this year however merchants and city officials are seeing red 
worried about the possible loss of their share of the 300 million 
in revenue spring training brings to florida each year 
only minor leaguers will be allowed to the spring training camps 
in florida and arizona under a lockout by owners who are battling 
players over salaries and other revenuerelated issues 
pitchers catchers and injured players had been scheduled to 
report to the dodgertown baseball compound thursday 
in vero beach one of 18 spring training sites in florida the 
dodgers pump 20 million to 25 million into the local economy each 
year said jb norton jr executive vice president of the vero 
beachindian river chamber of commerce 
a lockout until the opening of the regular season would cost 
vero beach merchants up to 5 million he said the dodgers minor 
league teams and other activities will keep some of the revenue 
flowing 
its not going to kill us but its not going to feel good 
either he said 
a 1987 study by the florida commerce department concluded fans 
spent more than 286 million at spring training and teams spent 
about 12 million 
among those with the most to lose by the lockout are restaurants 
and automobile rental agencies said norton 
at avis rent a car near the small vero beach airport manager 
joe brennan has 30 cars that normally would be taken by dodger 
players and personnel he didnt even bother requesting the 
additional 40 cars he needed last year 
its really going to hurt us if the lockout goes on but well 
survive said brennan it trickles down through the whole 
community if there are no games everyone will suffer to some 
extent from the hot dog vendors to the gas stations 
whats really a shame is the people who come down to see 
baseball and experience spring training they are the real losers 
in all this 
both economically and emotionally the dodgers are held dear in 
vero beach about 140 miles north of miami 
the town celebrated wildly following the dodgers 1988 world 
series victory many residents boast the lavish dodgertown complex 
far outshines the rival new york mets spring headquarters 20 miles 
south in port st lucie a dodgers cap is featured on the masthead 
of the local daily newspaper 
this is a dodger town and it will always be said alex 
carson a patron at duke sniders restaurant and bar named for the 
hall of fame brooklyn dodger second baseman 
if theres no spring training this year you know the old 
saying well get em next year 
near duke snider road in dodgertown bill richards and elmer 
otto sat on a railroad tie and took it easy thursday 
there were wearing their blue dodger spring training tshirts 
and caps but it didnt seem like a work day richards is assigned 
to the batting cage and otto is a cashier at the stadium 
richards raised his hand in a mock toast 
well heres to spring training he said 
yup said otto 
they got up and walked toward the dugouts

the federated and allied retailing companies 
will see lower sales for the first two months of this year but are 
committed to surviving their bankruptcy reorganizations intact 
their managers say 
were going to have a very poor fourth quarter james m 
zimmerman president and chief operating officer of federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp said thursday 
sales for the 260 stores that federated and allied operate in 28 
states were up 3 percent in december from the previous year but 
declined 9 percent in january and are down 4 percent this month 
zimmerman said he declined to be more specific 
january sales figures will be released march 5 while 
fourthquarter and yearend results are to be released to creditors 
and the public may 3 company spokeswoman carol sanger said the 
federatedallied fiscal year ended feb 3 
federated and allied could emerge from their chapter 11 
reorganizations in as soon as eight months said g william miller 
the former us treasury secretary hired jan 16 as chairman and 
chief executive officer of federated stores inc the newly created 
parent of federated and allied 
the two retailers owned by canadas campeau corp filed jan 
15 for protection from creditors listing 77 billion in debts 
miller addressing reporters with zimmerman and new 
federatedallied chairman allen i questrom said his optimistic 
projection could occur if federated and allied develop 
reorganization plans within the 120 days they are allowed and 
creditors and the us bankruptcy court give quick approval 
but miller said i dont promise you that thats possible or 
even feasible 
miller said he would like to keep federated and allied intact 
and not sell off divisions because he thinks doing so would reduce 
their value for creditors zimmerman said management is 
reconsidering the previously proposed sale of federateds new 
yorkbased bloomingdales store division to evaluate whether 
bloomingdales would be more valuable to retain 
miller described federated and allied as viable and profitable 
but said they must adjust the staggering debts amassed when the 
parent campeau corp of toronto acquired allied in 1986 and 
federated in 1988 
the capital structure is whats broke and is what brings us 
here today zimmerman said 
the chapter 11 filings have noticeably hurt confidence of 
customers and merchandise suppliers federated and allied are now 
receiving about 85 percent of the merchandise ordered compared 
with about 25 percent the week prior to the jan 15 filing 
zimmerman said 
the bankruptcy courts approval feb 9 of 700 million in 
debtorinpossession financing and 17 billion in credit 
facilities for receiving goods provided a critical boost for the 
two companies questrom said 
questrom lured away from neimanmarcus feb 2 with a fiveyear 
contract that will pay him 12 million annually said federated 
and allied face a challenge in trying to maintain market shares 
against financially healthy competitors 
he said he will focus on drawing back more of federated and 
allieds vendors and in adjusting merchandise inventories to keep 
customers coming in 
zimmerman said he expects no acrosstheboard layoffs among the 
combined 100000 federated and allied employees the companies have 
suffered no major employee losses because of the chapter 11 
filings but need to work on retaining employees questrom said

executives of federated department stores inc 
and allied stores corp say their goal is to repay the full amount 
owed to trade creditors 
but bondholders who financed campeau corps takeovers of the 
two retailing companies will have to forgive some of the 77 
billion debt listed in the bankruptcy petition filed jan 15 by 
federated and allied they said 
it is clear that some of that debt will not be 
decapitalized g william miller chairman of parent company 
federated stores inc said thursday some of it will have to 
disappear permanently 
for those who hold the debt the market is no longer there 
we want them to get a reasonable recovery 
miller federatedallied chairman allen questrom and president 
james zimmerman read prepared statements thursday to reporters and 
representatives of federatedallieds largest creditors 
they built on the theme that federated and allied which operate 
260 stores in 28 states are close to returning to business as 
usual and expect to be profitable 
they also acknowledged that mistakes were made in financing the 
acquisition of allied in 1986 and federated in 1988 by 
torontobased campeau and in operating the stores the past two 
years 
zimmerman said that by september 1989 it was evident that 
federated and allied could not meet their debt payments and that 
major financial restructuring was necessary 
but he said the decision to file for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act wasnt made until january 
and then primarily to prevent further erosion in the value of the 
businesses 
there was no plot to deceive any creditors zimmerman said 
there was no grand scheme in toronto or elsewhere to trick

creditors were left holding the bag with checks that did not clear 
prior to our filing 
questrom was vice chairman of federated department stores when 
it was acquired by campeau he said he left because of reservations 
as have been so tragically confirmed since about the parent 
companys ability to handle the debt it had assumed 
he subsequently became president of niemanmarcus but returned 
earlier this month for a guaranteed 10 million to find a 
company that deserved better than what it was getting better 
than what had been inherited in the wake of two massive retail 
takeovers inordinate organizational changes and months of 
debilitating uncertainty he said

leadership last month of the parent company campeau us on 
condition that it be renamed and assured autonomy distancing 
itself from robert campeau the canadian real estate developer who 
engineered the junk bondfinanced takeovers of allied and federated

miller said it was premature to sketch a reorganization plan 
publicly 
i would prefer to bring out a comprehensive plan where i can 
make sure all the pieces fit and all the wheels mesh and that it 
turns smoothly rather than feed out ideas before they have been 
researched before they have been discussed with the other side

dominos pizza inc tried to cut down on 
legal actions last year by giving its delivery people driving 
instruction but the safety effort also helped steer profits down 
164 percent 
the ann arborbased company also said launching a new product 
pan pizza led to a drop in 1989 profits to 51 million compared 
with net income of 61 million in 1988 
dominos has been the defendant in a series of legal actions 
blaming traffic accidents on drivers rushing to meet the 30minute 
pizza delivery deadline the company said costs come out of store 
budgets and not drivers pockets 
a videotaped drivertraining program was instituted in 1989 
the privately held companys 5200 stores twothirds of them 
owned by about 800 franchisees sold an estimated 250 million 
pizzas in 1989 dominos president dave black said 
systemwide sales rose 96 percent to 25 billion compared with 
23 billion in 1988 and dominos corporate revenue rose 9 percent

nike inc officials said they werent 
flattered when they first saw la gear incs mvp1 shoe which 
they maintain is an imitation of their popular air jordan 
basketball shoe 
nike filed suit against la gear in us district court here on 
thursday maintaining that la gear copied the air jordan design 
the suit alleging patent infringement and unfair competition 
also contends la gear copied the nikestyle sole for the mvp1 
and five other shoes 
imitation can be a form of flattery but this crosses the 
line said lindsay stewart an attorney for the beaverton 
orebased nike the nations top athletic shoemaker ahead of 
reebok and no 3 la gear 
gil n schwartzberg chief administrative officer for la gear 
denied the company copied nike designs he speculated nikes 
lawsuit may be motivated by la gears aggressive entry into the 
mens shoe market 
when youre talking about basketball shoes they all look 
somewhat similar to one another he said there are a lot of 
shoes out there that look a lot more like the air jordan but were 
the one they sue 
the air jordan is among nikes topselling shoes generating 45 
million in revenue for nike since september 1988 it is named after 
chicago bulls superstar michael jordan 
the air jordan is consistently the product were concerned 
about stewart said it is our bread and butter product we 
really feel it is the backbone of our basketball shoe line and it 
is a big issue to us 
stewart said the air jordan has distinctive design features 
including use of colors and materials 
its our contention that the mvp1 incorporated most if not 
all of those distinctive features and theyve done that to our 
disadvantage stewart said 
he said nike will seek substantial damages not yet undetermined

the oldsmobile division of general motors 
corp said it was making rare price cuts of as much as 500 on the 
price of two of its models in an unusual attempt to spur sales in a 
sluggish auto market 
while the nations big three automakers all have incentives in 
effect to boost sales that have slumped since the model year began 
in october oldsmobile spokesman gus buenz said he didnt believe 
the others had cut base prices this year 
as far as i know this is the first time that i can recall 
that gm has and certainly oldsmobile reduced prices in the model 
year he said normally when it occurs it is at the 
introduction of a new model year 
its certainly not the trend it is unusual painewebber 
inc of new york analyst ann knight said its not unprecedented 
its done when the models are slow the sales on those models have 
been weak 
increasingly in recent years gm ford motor co and chrysler 
corp have offered cash rebates to buyers and other incentives to 
dealers to stimulate car sales 
the increasing reliance on incentives has led some industry 
analysts lately to suggest that detroit was simply pricing its cars 
too high 
while the automakers might prefer price cuts to incentives 
knight said she was unsure if other companies would follow 
oldsmobiles lead 
i think companies would like to have price reductions instead 
of incentives a price cut is more disciplined a relief but 
incentives are so popular americans love bargains knight said 
its the way americans like to shop 
as the 1990 model year began last fall west german automakers 
volkswagen ag and bmw cut prices on some of their cars retreating 
from the rebate wars 
as of feb 16 the price of oldsmobiles ciera s coupe drops 
200 to 12195 while the ciera s sedans price drops 500 to 
12495 
if you take 200 off the base or offer a 200 rebate on the 
car its the same for the customer but the customer can start 
with a lower price when hes bargaining with the dealer buenz 
said 
the price cuts have no effect on the current incentives on the 
models that factories are offering to car dealers buenz refused to 
disclose the amounts of the incentives 
cutlass ciera s sales comprise 12 percent of total oldsmobile 
sales which totalled 163208 between oct 1 and feb 10 the 
current model year 
earlier thursday gm said its earnings fell 50 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 1989 to 7002 million from 14 billion in the 
last three months of 1988

financial troubles sent the bank of new england 
corp to the federal reserve bank to borrow money again amid 
reports the bank is ready to cut its workforce by some 5500 
employees 
bank spokesman thomas lavelle said the latest borrowing for the 
regions largest bank was on target with expectations 
the federal reserve bank of boston thursday reported loans 
totaling 931 million to member banks this week compared with 723 
million the week before 
certainly the finger does point at bank of new england said 
james moynihan senior vice president at advest inc 
the boston globe today reported that bank sources confirmed the 
bank is expected to announce a massive reduction plan that would 
layoff some 2500 employees and trim as many as 3000 other 
employees through attrition and the sale of various subsidiaries 
bank officials did not immediately return calls this morning 
seeking confirmation of the move 
the reductions expected to be announced next week when the bank 
releases its 1989 financial statement could have onethird of the 
banks 17500 employees off the payroll by the end of april the 
newspaper said 
a spokeswoman for the bank declined comment the globe said 
bank of new england which had estimated losses exceeding 1 
billion in 1989 because of bad real estate loans has seen 
depositors withdraw millions of dollars 
the bank has acknowledged that during the past few weeks it has 
sought help at the federal reserve bank considered to be the 
lender of last resort 
the bank has been trying to raise cash by selling off 6 billion 
worth of assets as of thursday the bank had sold or has 
agreements to sell 27 billion in assets lavelle said 
the bank also announced thursday it had reached an agreement to 
sell 1 billion of its loan portfolio to the canadian imperial bank 
of commerce 
a lot of deals have not closed yet moynihan said 
explaining the banks persistent cash crunch my guess was you 
might see them at this level 
the bank might be feeling increased pressure from customers who 
held large certificates of deposit exceeding the insured amount of 
100000 that have now reached their maturity dates analysts said 
many of those certificates are bought on 90day cycles which 
means they were purchased prior to the recent gloomy disclosures 
about bank of new england 
these large depositors can be expected to transfer their money 
to other banks when the certificates reach maturity moynihan said 
bank of new england said it was selling assets from its 
communications lending group whose portfolio includes loans to 
companies in the us communications and media industries 
canadian imperial one of the 10 largest banks in north america 
will acquire the loans in stages with payments planned to begin 
this month and to be completed by april 30 
the loans acquired by canadian imperial are being sold at face 
value meaning theres no gain on this lavelle said 
but analysts say until bank of new englands finances become 
more stable the banks priority is to raise cash 
the sale of this portion of our loan portfolio is a major 
component of our asset sales plan h ridgely bullock the banks 
interim chairman said in a statement it will significantly 
bolster our liquidity and improve our capital ratios

steel industry veteran tim moran believes he 
can loosen aluminums grip on the beverage can industry with a less 
expensive steel container that has won enthusiastic approval from 
pepsi and coke 
but if moran and the steel industry are to penetrate aluminums 
96 percent share of the market the key may not necessarily be in 
pricing their product but recycling it 
if cost were the only factor the potential switch from 
aluminum to steel would be greater said harold sohn an official 
at ball corp a leading can producer based in muncie ind 
the aluminum can he said really is an environmentally sound 
package and brewers and soft drink manufacturers want to be in 
that kind of package 
the steel industry recognizes the need to recycle and has 
formed the steel can recycling institute moran also recognizes 
that need and created a recycling division within his 2yearold 
company bevpak inc 
the 43yearold pittsburgh native left as general manager of the 
tin plate division of usx corp in 1987 to form bevpak which 
began production a year ago at monticello in northwest indiana one 
of the worlds largest steelproducing regions 
moran had seen the twopiece aluminum can slowly replace the 
threepiece steel product while the aluminum industry built a 
recycling infrastructure so efficient that today more than half its 
cans come back as scrap aluminum which in 1964 accounted for only 
2 percent of the beverage can market had half of it by 1977 and 
reached 92 percent in 1983 
in 1988 the last year for which the can manufacturers institute 
has complete figures aluminum accounted for 779 billion of the 
812 billion beverage cans produced in this country 
the price of aluminum cans has risen with its market share and 
the cost advantage of steel had reached as much as 8 per 1000 
cans when bevpak was starting out 
still moran sensed skepticism 
bevpak comes on the scene builds a 100 million steel can 
plant and the industry cant believe it moran said 
his 200employee plant can produce 1600 cans per minute or 2 
billion cans per year that represents half the total steel 
beverage can output in this country 
morans customer base stretches around the key industrial cities 
of the midwest softdrink giants pepsico inc and cocacola co 
leading users of cans supported him from the start he considers 
them the core advocates that were the base of the business 
and beer brewers are starting to show interest bevpak recently 
added a line to produce cans for miller brewing co 
there is a place in the market for bevpak weve got major 
billiondollar companies watching us moran said 
moran estimates 20 percent of his cans are recycled some 
collected through a bevpak division called recycle indiana 
resources it draws upon a network of 400 recyclers in indiana 
ohio and northern illinois operates 11 recycling trailers around 
indianapolis and runs motor routes in other indiana and ohio cities 
the twopiece steel can with its aluminum top is nearly 
identical to the allaluminum can but slightly heavier 
theyre both so light today that its almost impossible for 
the consumer to tell the difference said sal porrazzo director 
of environmental affairs for pepsico inc 
the competition between the two metals is fundamental to keeping 
prices down porrazzo said pepsi is using steel for 10 percent to 
12 percent of its can packaging he said 
the steel can is produced at a lower cost because steel is 
cheaper than aluminum but that factor becomes a negative in 
recycling where aluminum cans can fetch about 50 cents a pound 
steel is closer to 10 cents or less 
we certainly want to be in environmentally sound packaging 
porrazzo said the issue that comes up is are steel cans 
recyclable 
when you get to consumer recycling aspects theres a value 
difference that singles steel out as not being recyclable because 
it is not as valuable porazzo said you shouldnt penalize a 
package just because its recycled value is not as high 
sohn director of industrial affairs for balls denverbased 
package products groups said aluminums market domination was 
based on recyclability 
ball in 1973 opened a beverage can plant in findlay ohio with 
two steel lines but converted one to aluminum by the mid1980s 
when it opened a new plant in conroe texas in 1987 it had one 
steel line and one aluminum its other five beverage can plants 
produce only aluminum cans sohn said 
we make what the customer wants we dont force something on 
them clearly theres been a preference over the years for the 
aluminum because of its recyclability and recycling weight sohn 
said 
customer interest in steel is growing and the chances of steel 
regaining a greater share of the market are strong if aluminum 
prices remain high and steel gets its recycling program off the 
ground sohn said 
the nations top steel producers established the steel can 
recycling institute in 1988 steel is the most recycled material in 
the world and institute figures show twice as much steel was 
recycled in this country from 197988 than all other recycled 
materials combined 
however consumers werent getting the message 
it is fair to say the industry has not done a very good job of 
telling people they had a recycling infrastructure in place said 
elizabeth olenbush the institutes director of marketing

the us trade deficit aided by a dramatic 30 
percent improvement in december narrowed to 10858 billion last 
year to post the smallest yearly imbalance since 1984 the 
government reported today 
while economists were pleasantly surprised by the 717 billion 
december deficit they were unimpressed by the modest decline for 
the year 
the 84 percent decline in the annual deficit down from 11853 
billion in 1988 represented a sharp slowing in the pace of 
improvement the deficit had dropped 221 percent in 1988 
many economists are forecasting that the countrys trade 
performance could actually worsen this year after two years of 
improvements as americas dependence on foreign oil grows to record 
highs and consumers appetite for foreign goods shows little sign 
of slackening 
but the bush administration hailed the new trade figures as an 
indication that the improvement evident since 1988 was not in 
danger of stalling out 
commerce undersecretary michael darby noted that us exports 
were up 13 percent outpacing a 73 percent rise in imports 
growth in exports was strong across most categories of goods 
including a wide variety of manufactured goods especially 
machinery and telecommunications equipment he said 
as usual the countrys largest imbalance in 1989 was with 
japan a 49 billion deficit that accounted for 45 percent of the 
total 
another big part of the deficit came from oil imports which 
surged 272 percent in 1989 to 4894 billion it was the highest 
yearly total since a 524 billion foreign oil bill in 1984 
one of the primary reasons analysts are looking for little or no 
improvement in the trade deficit this year is a belief that us 
dependence on foreign oil will continue to grow the american 
petroleum institute reported that imports reached an alltime 
record of 54 percent of total demand in january while domestic 
production fell to its lowest level in a quartercentury 
the december deficit of 717 billion was the lowest monthly 
imbalance since a 679 billion deficit in december 1984 
the 30 percent improvement from novembers 1029 billion 
deficit occurred because exports rose 24 percent to 3111 
billion the secondhighest level on record while imports fell 59 
percent to 3828 billion 
the trade deficit is the difference between imports and exports 
for december the 31 billion improvement represented a big 
jump in american exports of aircraft reflecting the end of the 
boeing strike and smaller increases in office equipment artwork 
and antiques and industrial machinery 
the decline in imports in december represented in part a 300 
million decline in oil shipments which reflected a drop in volume 
that offset a rise in price 
the bush administration is counting on a continued improvement 
in the trade deficit this year to dampen protectionist sentiment in 
congress and to spur overall economic growth 
however many private forecasters are predicting that the 
deficit will begin rising this year reflecting slower growth in 
us exports and the higher foreign oil bill 
it is pretty fundamental that we are not competitive in world 
trade said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co if 
americans wont buy american goods there is no reason to expect 
the rest of the world to do so 
for 1989 exports climbed 13 percent to an alltime high of 
36435 billion imports also reached a record high of 47293 
billion up 73 percent from 1988 
the 49 billion deficit with japan was down slightly from a 
518 billion imbalance in 1988 other large deficits occurred with 
taiwan 13 billion canada 962 billion and china 618

leon bressler who joined lanvin in september after working for 
midland bank sa will be retained as lanvins chairman orcofi said

midland to take a profit and invest in other areas 
lanvin posted losses of the equivalent of 175 million in 1988 
but earned a 53 million profit under 1989 restructuring 
the house founded in 1890 by jeanne lavin retained 
readytowear designer claude montana last year to run its haute 
couture department but his first collection drew boos from fashion 
critics in january 
orcofi holds an 855 percent stake in vuitton investissement 
gestion the conduit for most of the vuitton familys holding in 
the luxury conglomerate louis vuitton moet hennessey lvmh

in other luxurygoods companies including the leather tannery 
gordonchoisy sa and luxury stores investment an international 
distribution concern 
the vuitton family has been at odds with bernard arnault who 
shares control with guinness plc in jacques rober sa a holding 
company with a 45 percent stake in lvmh shares 
arnault has said on several occastions that he would like to 
oust henry racamier who represents the vuitton family in lvmh 
from louis vuitton sa the baggage and leather goods maker 
the dispute has repeatedly delayed the groups annual meeting 
and lvmh hasnt yet produced confirmed revenue figures for 1989

drexel burnham lambert the pioneering wall 
street firm that abruptly collapsed last week met disaster in the 
same goitalone style that once had brought so much success 
during the glory years of the junk bond market it helped 
create drexel stamped itself as a maverick operation driven by 
aggressiveness and innovation 
then after the firms fortunes took a severe downward turn few 
allies from either wall street or washington stood ready to come to 
the rescue 
so drexels transformation within a matter of months from the 
fifth largest firm in the securities business to chapter 11 
bankruptcy was widely described as a classic tale of live by the 
sword die by the sword capitalism 
it was a typical example of wall street excess as one 
veteran analyst put it you get something good and you push it 
until it blows up 
five years ago drexel seemed anything but a doomed business 
led by superstar financier michael milken it dominated the market 
for highyield lowerquality bonds used to raise money for 
corporations of less than blue chip standing and later to 
finance a boom in corporate takeovers and buyouts 
by last week though all of drexels good fortune had run out 
milken was gone as part of a december 1988 agreement between the 
firm and the federal government to settle charges of fraud and 
drexel faced a host of other legal battles 
competitors had started gaining on it even as the junkbond game 
was cooling the woes of the junk market intensified late last 
summer when a deal in which drexel played no part campeau corps 
acquisition of federated department stores and allied stores went 
sour 
finally drexel began to look in desperation for a merger 
partner or other source of outside capital but found no takers 
regulators after inspecting the firm on the brink of failure 
declined to intervene 
in no small measure observers say drexel fell victim to its 
own success the commotion it created and maybe even the envy it 
aroused 
as a prominent force behind the debtfinanced buyout boom 
drexel had come to be seen as a source of aggravation and 
frustration to many government officials said lawrence 
eckenfelder an analyst who follows the securities industry for the 
rival house of prudentialbache securities 
furthermore he noted because drexel previously had disposed of 
the part of its brokerage business that dealt with the public 
you didnt have a sense that the consumer had to be protected 
the hunt for a merger partner meanwhile was severely hampered 
by the specter of drexels legal problems that was probably the 
major thing that scared everybody away eckenfelder said 
if drexel once thrived as a seemingly indispensible part of the 
junkbond business it expired because it became irrelevant in 
the view of charles vincent a financialservices analyst at the 
provident national bank in philadelphia 
the junkbond market no longer depended on drexel and they 
werent doing anything outside of that that was unique on wall 
street vincent said 
no one depended on them their failure represented no threat 
to financial stability 
such businesslike appraisals of course were cold comfort to 
the 5000 drexel employees left to cast about for other employment 
in an industry job market that has been tightening ever since the 
1987 crash in stock prices 
drexels other likely legacy most observers agree is a lasting 
role for junk bonds as a capitalraising tool in business though 
perhaps never again to the extent that they were used or abused 
over the last few years 
im sure drexel rubbed people the wrong way said one 
analyst who declined to be identified but i think it was more 
jealousy than anger any other firm on the street given half the 
chance would have done the same thing 
said eckenfelder it was scary in a way to see how quickly 
they could fall

will perriers fizzle become 
saratogas bubbles 
if experts predictions hold out the recall of perriers 
popular mineral water could be a boon to smaller competitors such 
as the saratoga springs mineral water co 
its too early to tell if saratoga mineral water will capture 
some of the market dominated by the chic french brand but initial 
signs are sparkling say officials at evian waters of france inc 
the parent company of the saratoga springs firm 
more distributors are calling and placing orders said david 
daniel evians chief executive officer its busier than what 
youd normally expect 
source perrier sa recalled its water from worldwide distribution 
this week after small amounts of a naturally occurring toxic gas 
passed through a dirty filter and contaminated some bottles 
officials at perriers us subsidiary have said they expect the 
green bottles to be kept out of the united states for several 
months 
that will be a blow to perrier which built the us sparkling 
mineral water market nearly from scratch in the 1970s its perrier 
brand was the third biggest seller among all bottled water brands 
and the leading imported brand sold in the united states in 1988 
accounting for 57 percent of the industrys 22 billion in sales 
according to beverage marketing corp in new york 
it could mean big bucks for competitors 
if competitors move quickly theyll benefit said hellen 
berry of beverage marketing 
perrier did a tremendous job getting into the market but its 
going to be gone berry said something will have to fill the 
void 
that something could be saratoga mineral water which plans to 
launch a major new advertising campaign in the next few weeks 
daniel says the timing of the ad campaign and the perrier recall 
is just coincidence 
they were primed to go on no matter what happened berry 
said 
saratoga is no newcomer to the bottled water business the 
waters of saratoga springs have drawn visitors to this quaint town 
for more than 200 years according to folklore george washington 
drank from the springs here 
by the 1830s a thriving social scene had grown up around the 
springs when franklin roosevelt was governor of new york he 
pushed the development several mineral water bath houses 
roosevelt a polio victim was a regular user of the baths and 
consumed the waters 
saratoga mineral water was first bottled in 1872 when the 
thensaratoga vichy co developed a well near what is now the 
saratoga state spa park the water came bubbling up from the ground 
full of minerals and carbon dioxide percolated out of ancient 
volcanic faults in the adirondack mountain foothills 
salt bicarbonate of soda and artificial carbonation were added 
to the spring water which was then bottled it was a modest seller 
the mineral water was eventually dropped in favor of a product 
that was more competitive with its european counterparts 
saratoga mineral water is now sold in stores restaurants and 
bars in 23 states in the eastern half of the country 
daniel says the company is beginning to make a real push into 
supermarkets where the bulk of mineral water is sold perriers 
temporary absence may give saratoga the edge it needs 
sales in bars and restaurants are good for your image but 
volume tends to be relatively small in relation to the volume you 
can sell in major retail markets daniel said 
experts question whether the smaller bottled water companies are 
strong enough to fill the temporary void left by perrier 
there are about 450 water bottling plants in the united states 
producing more than 600 different labels of drinking water natural 
water and spring water according to bevmark inc a los 
angelesbased consulting firm in addition there are more than 50 
brands of imported waters bevmark said 
berry said 1989 sales of saratoga mineral water were greatly 
improved over previous years but were still small compared to 
perriers she estimates last years sales for saratoga in the 10 
million range perrier had sales in the united states of 150 
million last year 
perrier officials say benzene a chemical used in cleaning 
solvents entered its water in traces when workers failed to change 
a pipe filter at the companys natural spring at vergeze in 
southern france 
earlier perrier had said it believed an employee mistakenly 
used a product containing benzene to clean grease from one bottling 
line

chemical maker georgia gulf corp on friday 
rejected a 11 billion buyout offer from texas investor harold c 
simmons saying the 45ashare bid was too low 
in a letter to shareholders georgia gulfs board of directors 
said they decided unanimously against the offer the board called 
it inadequate coercive and too conditional 
the directors said shareholders would benefit more from the 
proposed recapitalization announced earlier by georgia gulf 
officials at nl industries inc the houston company controlled 
by simmons that made the tender offer last month could not be 
reached immediately for comment friday nl president j landis 
martin did not return calls made to his office 
in our view nls offer represents an attempt to take 
advantage of the current vulnerability of the company resulting 
from shortterm economic and market conditions said the georgia 
gulf letter released friday 
we believe that the 45pershare price offered by nl does not 
reflect the kind of premium that ought to be received by the 
companys stockholders in a transaction in which control of the 
company would be sold the letter said 
georgia gulfs directors and officers own about 17 percent of 
the company while simmons has about a 99 percent stake 
nl in its tender offer also proposed replacing the georgia 
gulf board 
georgia gulf in january announced a proposed recapitalization of 
the company designed to discouraged simmons from launching a 
takeover the company valued the recapitalization which has yet to 
go before shareholders at 55 a share and it was widely believed 
the move would placate simmons the company did not say what the 
recapitalization would involve 
nl however launched its tender offer two weeks later saying 
the recapitalization probably would provide stockholders with less 
than 45 a share 
georgia gulf said friday it has received bank notification that 
no obstacles to financing the recapitalization have emerged so far 
under a recapitalization a company usually borrows a large sum of 
money to fund a special dividend or an expansion

drexel burnham lambert inc is dying not its 
deals 
like bargain hunters at a garage sale wall streets big 
investment banks are sifting through the remnants of drexels 
businesses and scrambling to sign up its clients 
drexel fired most of its 5300 employees on friday keeping only 
enough staff to wrap up pending deals or help transfer the business 
to other firms 
half of these things were in midstream said michael madden 
head of mergers and acquisitions at shearson lehman hutton inc 
which picked up one large drexel deal suddenly drexel is without 
the ability to get it done the client says whoops what do i do 
now 
deals stuck in limbo since the chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
filing by drexels parent range from mergers to junk bond 
underwritings the prospective fees total in the millions 
top investment banks such as merrill lynch amp co morgan stanley 
group inc goldman sachs amp co and first boston corp are all 
angling for the business industry executives said with wall 
street in a prolonged slump drexels passing has been an 
unexpected windfall for firms eager for some lucrative work 
according to securities data co the dollar volume of mergers 
and acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 1989 declined 
366 percent from the same 1988 period 
because of the slowdown it makes the battle to get drexels 
primary clents all that more fearsome said perrin long who 
follows the securities industry for lipper analytical services 
executives from mesa petroleum co jetted in from texas this 
week and rode in limousines from investment bank to investment bank 
to complete the transfer of a planned 350 million to 400 million 
royalty trust offering that drexel was supposed to manage 
after losing to drexel in the initial bidding to head the deal 
shearson beat out merrill lynch for the mesa offering which would 
create a royalty trust a legal vehicle to hold property on the 
companys hugoton and panoma natural gas fields in oklahoma and 
kansas 
mesa which is headed by corporate raider t boone pickens jr 
is offering a 32 percent stake in the fields to the public the 
offer had been registered with the securities and exchange 
commission for two weeks and was set to go ahead when drexel fell 
drexel investment bankers have cooperated with the transition 
which focuses on marketing the issue 16 million units to be 
priced between 22 and 25 each to institutional and retail 
investors marketing was supposed to start friday but has been 
delayed 
the drexel guys were very cooperative said grant porter 
who heads shearsons natural resources coporate finance group 
they worked long and hard on this transaction and its a great 
disappointment to them to have to step aside 
but he added people are ready willing and able to step into 
the shoes of drexel in these circumstances 
despite a drought in new issues of junk bonds to raise money 
firms also are actively competing for about two dozen planned 
drexel offerings worth in the billions for companies such as foods 
4 less supermarkets inc and general host corp 
firms wont necessarily try to sell the new bonds to investors 
immediately there have been only two new junkbond offerings so 
far this year according to secrutiies data but they do plan to 
get to know clients and strategy analysts said 
as in the mesa offering introducing corporate officials to a 
new team of investment bankers is causing delays 
its like moving into a new home long said you get up in 
the middle of the night youre bumping into things

drexel burnham lambert group incs british units 
took steps friday to wind down their operations following the us 
parent companys bankruptcy petition tuesday 
drexel officials were talking with various parties over the 
possibility of selling the british operations in pieces a company 
official said 
meanwhile kpmg peat marwick mclintock the british arm of the 
international accounting firm on friday was appointed by britains 
high court as administrator of drexel burnham lambert holding ltd 
a holding company for most of the london operations 
it also was appointed administrator for two units drexel 
burnham lambert ltd its metals soft commodities and oil futures 
trading arm and drexel burnham lambert securities ltd 
these three companies filed petitions with the bankruptcy 
section of the high court earlier friday 
in filing the administrative petitions drexel essentially 
sought the courts guidance in ascribing priorities to creditors or 
claimants against its operations 
peat marwick said its job would be to ensure that all 
commitments with the three drexel units are honored in full 
and that drexels clients are totally unaffected by events 
occurring in other parts of the group 
james furlong a drexel senior vice president in charge of 
europeanbased equities trading said his division was in talks 
with three major institutions about the possibility of the 
divisions sale 
he said he had no doubt that the staff would stay together 
furlongs staff of 60 trades in us stocks and related 
products drexels nonus stock trading business was curtailed 
last year 
the heads of drexels several europeanbased operations held 
discussions in london for much of friday furlong said strategies 
emerging from the meetings suggest the divisions will attempt to 
market themselves individually to prospective buyers he said 
for equities the first option was to find a buyer for the whole 
of the equities business outside the united states comprising both 
european and asian operations with a total staff of 300 he said 
the second option was to find a buyer for the european sales 
staff alone furlong said that three institutions so far have shown 
interest in this plan 
there so far have been no resignations or defections from the 
european team and morale was good furlong said 
on thursday the bank of england announced a special settlements 
arrangement for foreign exchange trades involving drexel in london 
to prevent liquidity problems 
also thursday the london clearing house which is responsible 
for clearing operations on the london metal exchange international 
petroleum exchange and several other markets declared drexel in 
default of all its commodities futures business

grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly 
lower friday on the chicago board of trade largely reflecting 
profittaking as traders evened up their positions ahead of the 
long weekend 
the board of trade will be closed monday for presidents day 
additional selling in the wheat market was attributed to a lack 
of significant new export businesses and to expectations that the 
slow pace of export sales will continue next week 
wheat futures had risen earlier in the week in anticipation of a 
bid by china for some of the 1 million metric tons of subsidized 
wheat offered to it last week by the agriculture department but 
the chinese business did not materialize 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 383 a bushel corn futures 
were cent to 1 cents lower with march at 241 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 2 cents lower with march at 138 a bushel and 
soybeans were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with march at 569 a

summer its editors were deluged with calls and letters from 
readers criticizing the changes this week as the paper 
reintroduces the new old version of its tv week it is taking to 
the airwaves with a series of tongueincheek advertisements 
hoping to win back the disgruntled 
its a story about being misunderstood and having the guts to 
overcome it about being unwanted and unloved and finding the 
strength to change the ads narrator says 
refreshingly simple says the boston globe the ad 
continues the boston globe calls it this years best revival 
and the boston globe raves now you can read it 
last june the globe altered the format of its weekly tv 
listings to cut a few pages the move which saved a few hundred 
thousand dollars was part of a general belttightening as 
newspapers everywhere confronted lagging revenues globe spokesman 
richard gulla said friday 
the earlier format featured a horizontal grid of shows scheduled 
for prime time as well as a rolling log that listed in narrative 
form the days schedule with blurbs for some of the movies 
after the changes listings for the entire day were compiled in 
a vertical grid with the names of the channels heading the 
columns the type was smaller there was no rolling log and no 
blurbs explained the shows 
readers went bananas gulla said 
more than 3000 called in to express their outrage many readers 
who called said the main reason they bought the sunday globe was 
for the old tv week reported robert l kierstead the papers 
ombudsman he wrote that one boston man told him if it wasnt 
broken why did you have to fix it 
part of what it shows you is how much tv is a part of peoples 
lives gulla said 
in october the globe put a questionnaire in a sunday edition 
circulation 800000 asking readers what they thought of the 
changes over 37000 responded in 17 days and nearly 90 percent of 
them said they were not happy gulla said 
it certainly was a mistake on our part he said we didnt 
recognize how near and dear this was to peoples hearts 
the globe could have used a lesson from executives at the 
cocacola co in 1985 when the atlantabased company introduced 
new coke and stopped making the old formula there was a consumer 
outcry said a coke spokesman 
consumers were very specific and aggressive about telling us 
that they wanted the old formula said spokesman randy donaldson 
three months later old coke was back on the shelves this time 
under the guise of cocacola classic 
unfortunately for the globe they couldnt simply release the 
old product in a new can it took eight months of surveys and focus 
groups before the first edition of the new old tv listings 
returned to the newsstand and like coke classic the new product 
is markedly similar to that of eight months ago 
people were telling us dont mess with my tv book and we 
heard them loud and clear gulla said rather than continue to 
irritate the readers we went back 
distributing the survey and launching the focus groups cost the 
paper less than 20000 gulla said that did not include the 
cost of staff time spent on the project or those advertisers or 
readers that may have left the paper over the issue he said

advertising that used animated characters 
ranging from dancing raisins to a drumming rabbit scored well when 
consumers were asked to pick the best commercials of 1989 a 
research firm said friday 
ads with surprise endings or unusual twists such as cats that 
appear to have human voices also did well according to the survey 
by video storyboard tests inc 
celebrities touting products were not as popular continuing a 
slump of several years said video storyboard president david 
vadehra 
some advertisers feel that is still one of the easiest ways to 
get attention he said 
but he said the 1989 survey results based on interviews with 
24000 consumers across the country indicated tv viewers are 
tuning those ads out 
topping the firms 11th annual survey results were commercials 
from mcdonalds corp the nations biggest fastfood restaurant 
chain 
the oak brook illbased companys advertised promotions last 
year that included tieins with the movies the little mermaid 
and all dogs go to heaven 
vadehra said the commercials that consumers cited most often 
from mcdonalds were one called first love that showed a young 
boy bidding goodbye to the girl he met at mcdonalds as he and his 
family move to another neighborhood and another ad in which people 
recited the menu in a rap song 
second were ads for pepsi and diet pepsi many of which 
contained celebrities but vadehra said the pepsi ad consumers 
cited most often featured monkeys who get the right soft drink from 
the vending machine for the researcher studying their behavior 
the california raisin ads featuring a claymation version of 
entertainer michael jackson placed third the campaign slipped 
somewhat after ranking first in each of the past two years 
commercials for energizer batteries featuring a pink toy rabbit 
that played a drum and showed up without warning in ads for other 
products came in fourth for the year vadehra said the ad was 
unusual in that it not only captured attention but made the point 
that the battery goes on and on 
rounding out the top five was the campaign for isuzu cars and 
trucks that featured an isuzu spokesman riding by a competitors 
lot and encouraging buyers to ask the dealer how his vehicles 
stacked up to isuzus 
ads for bud light beer came in sixth followed by ads for 
cocacola soft drinks including appearances by entertainer george 
michael and actor art carney and by commercials for miller lite 
beer 
commercials for infiniti cars which for months featured scenes 
of nature a narrator talking about values and the senses but nary 
a shot of the new car finished ninth the ads were widely attacked 
in the trade press but vadehra said consumers liked them because 
they were so different from other car commercials 
a woman from florida told interviewers an inifinit ad was a 
heady commercial that made her do a lot of thinking and 
visualizing a woman from chicago said it was very subtle and 
stil grabs you and makes you think about the car that is not 
there 
nike placed 10th with its commercials that included one 
featuring baseball and football star bo jackson and a host of 
athletes who attested that bo knows other sports 
vadehra said consumers liked the ad because the athletes never 
specifically pushed nike shoes appearing instead to be encouraging 
them simply to be active 
among other bestliked ads from 1989 were a commercial for 
friskies pet food that showed a cat running around the house 
looking for a meal as the sound of a race car engine played in the 
background and an ad for nine lives pet food that showed kittens 
who appeared to be calling for dinner with human voices 
vadehra said advertisers like to use animated characters because 
they are safer than using celebrities whose reallife problems can 
sometimes reflect poorly on products they tout he said the 
characteristics of animated characters are sometimes better known 
than those of real people an advantage that advertisers can 
exploit

securities traders at the drexel 
burnham lambert inc division where the explosive junkbond market 
of the 1980s got its start packed their belongings friday and rued 
the loss of their jobs their company and former leader michael 
milken 
employees hurriedly entered the wilshire boulevard headquarters 
packed boxes consoled colleagues and talked of other jobs 
drexels parent company filed for bankruptcy protection this 
week in new york after defaulting on 100 million in shortterm 
debt and failing to raise financing to prevent further defaults 
drexel blamed its demise on a capital shortage created in part by a 
decline in the junkbond market an erosion of confidence in the 
firm also hurt 
many of the departing employees refused to talk with reporters 
friday on short final walks to or from a parking garage dotted 
with mercedesbenzes and jaguars 
one man briefcase in hand walked past a small group of 
reporters bunch of vultures hanging over a dead body he 
uttered shaking his head slightly and refusing comment 
others took the time to note the end of an era 
there are some tears today we all regard it as a real shame 
and a tragedy said john e oden director of institutional 
placement in drexels real estate division i feel like it could 
have been prevented 
oden said many drexel employees continued to hold milken in high 
regard and viewed his prosecution by former us attorney rudolph 
giuliani as the beginning of the end 
the junkbond division was drastically altered when milken got 
into criminal trouble he quit the firm last june but had been 
working only parttime for close to a year he and partners still 
own the headquarters building 
we could have used mike milken oden said i think he 
could have had a positive impact and would have helped us get down 
the road 
he added that drexels payment of fines and restitution for 
securities trading violations also did the firm grave harm a total 
of 500 million of 650 million has been paid 
employees were on the telephones early friday as they usually 
are but instead of their normal duties they were selling 
positions in securities and pursuing work 
im just going to let people know im available oden said 
life goes on you cant get down 
four men walked into the building coffee in hand you know of 
any jobs a couple asked 
oden and others said they were still reeling from the news of 
drexels folding 
it was a definite shock people didnt see it coming said 
andy gumaer a division vice president in the beverly hills office 
what michael did was a positive thing gumaer said the 
truth is in hindsight maybe the firm should have stood behind 
michael milken a lot of people feel that way 
in hindsight you have to wonder whether we could have called 
the bluff of giuliani and not have pleaded guilty 
gumaer and others said employees were forming small groups to 
collectively look for work and some were considering going into 
business independently 
gumaer said he personally hoped to get back into the liquidation 
firm that he helped run before he joined drexel three years ago 
i would love to get this account he said gazing at the 
building that became home to drexels highyield division in 1978

while bank of new england corp desperately tries 
to improve its health by selling assets and eliminating thousands 
of workers those steps might not save the bank from the growing 
ills of bad real estate loans analysts said friday 
they are probably not far behind drexel said virginia 
adair a banking analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc the wall 
street investment firm that filed for bankruptcy this week over 
junk bond losses 
since last month when bank of new england said its 1989 losses 
should exceed 1 billion the bank has tried to stop the 
hemorrhaging the bank is near the halfway point in a plan to sell 
6 billion in assets and marcia ryan a company spokeswoman said 
friday the bank expects to lay off about 2000 employees 
the timing of the layoffs is not final and they do not include 
other payroll cuts the bank will implement through attrition and 
the sale of assets ryan said 
i think its stable and improving she said referring to 
the banks condition 
but analysts were more cautious they say the sagging new 
england economy which has contributed to the banks mounting pile 
of troubled loans could decline further and drag down the bank 
they appear to be right on target with their plan but you 
wish they werent there in the first place said gerard cassidy 
an analyst with tucker anthony inc 
bank of new england is expected to report its 1989 financial 
results next week at the same time ryan said the bank should 
disclose details of a consent order negotiated with the federal 
government that will describe steps the bank will take to fix its 
finances 
analysts predict bank of new england which employs about 17500 
people eventually will cut its payroll to around 13000 the 
banks assets which totaled 315 billion last year should shrink 
by about onethird by the time the sales are completed 
before the bank took its tumble it rose to become the 
secondlargest bank holding company in new england behind bank of 
boston corp and the 15th largest nationwide much of the growth 
came through aggressive real estate lending during a construction 
boom in the mid1980s but when the real estate market declined 
during an economic downturn the credit losses mounted 
the bank has come under intense scrutiny by federal regulators 
and in the last several weeks the board of directors has forced 
out the banks chairman walter j connolly and other senior 
executives 
analysts say the heavy presence of the federal government is 
reflected in the banks delay in releasing its financial results 
and plans for the consent order 
the decisions about the future are being decided on by the 
management with the regulators adair said describing the bank 
as being under de facto control of the government 
for the moment the banks priority is to avoid running out of 
money analysts said depositors have withdrawn millions of 
dollars and more money is expected to flow from the bank as 
certificates of deposit which were bought before the bad news 
surfaced reach maturity 
because of this cash crunch the bank has been forced to borrow 
money from the federal reserve bank of boston the federal reserve 
does not identify borrowers but the agencys boston bank has 
loaned out more than 900 million and analysts say bank of new 
england appears to have received most of the money 
but even if the bank emerges from the cash crisis by completing 
the sale of assets cassidy said the next issue will be what are 
they left with 
the bank will have a higher concentration of poor loans since 
they will be balanced against a smaller base of good assets 
analysts said 
james moynihan senior vice president of advest inc in boston 
said the bank possibly could segregate the troubled loans in a 
single subsidiary and bring in specialists to deal with them 
the sound assets could be pulled together in a good bank he 
said that can be run like a good bank and compete 
but until bank of new england gets its house in order moynihan 
said its clearly a daybyday situation

bond prices finished little changed friday after 
a sluggish preholiday session and inconclusive evidence on the 
direction of the economy 
the closely watched 30year treasury issue fell 116 point or 
about 60 cents for every 1000 in face value its yield which 
rises when the price declines inched up to 846 percent from 845 
percent late thursday 
trading in the government bond markets ended at about 2 pm 
several hours earlier than normal as traders got a head start on 
the threeday weekend that will mark mondays observance of the 
presidents day holiday 
the government reported friday that the us trade deficit fell 
to 717 billion in december down from 1029 billion in november 
the deficit narrowed to 10858 billion last year the smallest 
yearly imbalance since 1984 
elliott platt director of economic research at donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp said many analysts had expected 
a deficit of 9 billion for december but he said the market failed 
to react to the report despite the possibility that a smaller 
deficit suggests added strength in the economy normally a negative 
development for bond prices 
in a separate report the federal reserve said industrial 
production fell 12 percent in january following a revised 02 
percent gain in output a month earlier 
analysts said the market failed to react to this report either 
william sullivan jr who follows the credit markets for dean 
witter reynolds inc said the report was distorted by unusually 
warm weather in january that cut the need for production of 
electricity for heating and by an anticipated decline in auto 
production 
sullivan said that by adjusting for those two special factors 
industrial production would have been up slightly 
he said traders also are worried that interest rates are going 
to rise in japan and west germany luring investors to securities 
in those countries rather than to dollardenominated securities 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues finished unchanged intermediate 
maturities were unchanged to 132 point lower and longterm issues 
slipped as much as 116 point according to figures provided by 
telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer slipped 017 to 116029 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 132 point to 92 316 the average 
yield to maturity held steady at 739 percent 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 792 percent as the 
discount dropped 2 basis points to 767 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 806 percent as the discount lost 1 basis 
point to 765 percent yields on oneyear bills held at 808 
percent as the discount remained at 752 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 percent down from 
8rsqb percent late thursday

encouraging report on the us trade deficit

470 to close at 41710 a troy ounce republic national bank of

merchandise trade report for december which showed an impressive 
30 percent drop in the deficit to 717 billion from 1029 
billion in november 
while the figure was far better than expected traders focused 
on the fact that imports were down 59 percent which they 
interpreted as an indication that consumer spending is slackening 
it was seen as showing underlying weakness in the economy 
said stephen flanagan a vice president at manufacturers hanover 
trust co 
the dollars inability to extend the gains it posted in the 
previous session brought back all the underlying bearishness in 
the market flanagan said 
a dealer with bank of america in london said the fundamental 
situation for the dollar is still down if the dollar doesnt 
rally on a 71 billion deficit then its in some trouble 
the currency took another hit with the release of a separate 
government report that showed industrial production in january 
slipped 12 percent traders said the decline was much larger than 
expected 
it reinforced the weakness in the economy that people picked 
out of the trade report flanagan said

first boston corp said friday it was 
eliminating its bond futures brokerage business for customers on 
the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange and 
laying off 29 employees 
the private new yorkbased investment bank said it will continue 
trading listed futures for its own account on the two exchanges 
we will be phasing out in an orderly fashion so customers can 
unwind their futures positions andor transfer accounts to other 
brokers said first boston spokesman fred garcia 
first boston said the decision was made after a sixmonth 
strategic review of all its businesses the company would not 
disclose the number of customers or futures contracts involved 
both exchanges declined comment 
the move will affect 29 employees in new york chicago los 
angeles and tokyo who were notified on friday garcia said 
first boston will retain two of nine current seats on the board 
of trade and at least one of seven on the merc 
in a prepared statement futures managing director robert s 
cohen said changes in the futures market in the last 12 years 
prompted the decision which was unrelated to events in any other 
financial markets 
first bostons ability to provide valueadded service for our 
customers has diminished given the breadth of readilyaccessible 
information and analytics and the overcapacity in the brokerage 
community cohen said 
the securities brokerage industry has slumped since the 1987 
stock market crash several brokerages have pared down their 
businesses and laid off hundreds of workers this week the parent 
of one of the nations largest brokerages drexel burnham lambert 
inc announced it had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
first boston announced 200 layoffs last spring in what garcia 
called part of the overcapacity after the stock market crash of 
1987 
in january 1989 first boston merged with its londonbased 
sister company financiere credit suissefirst boston in a 11 
billion deal the combined entity which is privately held is 
called cs first boston inc the merger capped a difficult twoyear 
period during which first boston lost about 100 million in trading 
risky options on treasury bonds and another 50 million in trading

industrial production took its biggest plunge 
in nearly four years last month the government said friday but 
analysts cited temporary factors for the 12 percent drop and said 
output should resume its sluggish growth 
the federal reserve said the production slump was the steepest 
since output plummeted 13 percent in march 1986 but it attributed 
the decrease to a drop in energy use due to abnormally warm weather 
and to temporary layoffs in the automobile industry to correct 
bloated inventories 
if you take energy and autos out the index was up 02 
percent said michael k evans head of a washington economic 
forecasting firm bearing his name 
the figures are more commensurate with the softlanding 
scenario for the economy that is slow growth than with the 
possibility that were actually heading into a recession said 
gordon richards economic policy director for the national 
association of manufacturers 
priscilla trumbull an economist with the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa agreed saying outside of those areas production 
basically was moving very slowly upward and thats what weve been 
seeing for the last three to four months 
the fed said utility output which rose 63 percent during 
decembers bitter cold reversed itself in january and fell 107 
percent 
according to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration january temperatures were the warmest for that 
month since the government began keeping records 96 years ago 
december was the fourth coldest on record 
the output of motor vehicles was curtailed drastically the 
department said as automobile assemblies plunged to a 41 
million unit annual rate from a 62 million unit rate in december 
as a result manufacturing production which represents 84 
percent of industrial output was off 09 percent last month 
but ms trumbull said many of the laidoff workers have 
returned to production lines and well probably see an uptick 
in februarys report 
durable goods manufacturing which includes autos and other 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years was down 
17 percent nondurable goods manufacturing on the other hand 
rose 02 percent 
mining production was up 21 percent after falling 2 percent in 
december because of the cold weather 
the changes meant the industrial production index in january 
stood at 1409 percent of its 1977 base down from 1425 percent a 
month earlier 
reflecting the decline in output the feds report friday on the 
operating rate of the nations factories mines and utilities also 
dipped 12 percentage point to 819 percent last month it was the 
lowest since a similar 819 percent rate in october 1987 that 
followed an 811 percent rate a month earlier the rate had 
remained steady at 831 percent during the last three months of 
1989 
analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or 
above as an indication of inflationary pressures so while 
indicating a weak economy it could be interpreted as good news for 
consumers 
the manufacturingplant operating rate in january also slipped 
to 819 percent from 829 percent in december the rate had peaked 
at 847 percent in january 1989 the rate at factories producing 
durable goods fell from 809 percent to 794 percent 
operating rates for auto and truck assembly facilities dropped 
to levels near their 1982 recession lows the department said 
the utility operating rate fell from 864 percent to 771 
percent in part because utilization at power plants dropped about 
10 percentage points because of the weather the department said 
the rate at factories producing nondurable goods fell 01 
percentage point to 856 percent the operating rate at mines was 
down 08 percentage point to 847 percent

copper futures settled unchanged to 435 cents higher with the 
contract for spot delivery up 435 cents at 11285 a pound and the 
more actively traded march contract up 43 cents at 11135 a pound 
traders bid up prices going into the close despite the fact that 
the market will be closed monday for presidents day traders 
usually are cautious heading into a threeday weekend 
signs of shrinking copper stocks provided the strongest upward 
pressure after two days of unchanged levels the commodity

sharper daily drop in warehouse stocks down 609 tons to 3020 tons

friday appeared to be headed for the far east 
thursdays stocks report came on the heels of a government 
report that january housing starts were running at a recordhigh 
annual pace that news was bullish for copper since copper wire and 
tubing are used heavily in home construction 
the housingstarts surprise was followed friday by the 
governments report that the nation closed out 1989 with a 1086 
billion trade deficit the smallest in five years 
the good economic news contrasted sharply with recent 
perceptions of a recession in the making and as the economy 
strengthens so does demand for copper by the manufacturing and 
construction industries 
i think some of the recent economic data has suggested that we 
could run into problems with copper supplies said randolph 
donney a research analyst with the commodities brokerage elders

against other major currencies 
gold futures rose 460 to 550 on the comex with february

with march at 2242 a barrel heating oil was 95 cent to 117 
cents lower with march at 5748 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline

departments monthly cattleonfeed report for the seven largest 
cattleproducing states 
the report showed a 7 percent increase from a year ago in the 
number of cattle being fed for slaughter as of feb 1 compared 
with traders expectations for about a 4 percent increase

tuesday in reaction to the report 
live cattle settled 10 cent lower to 28 cent higher with 
february at 7977 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 23 
cent higher with march at 8217 cents a pound live hogs were 10

after leaving drexel burnham lambert inc on 
friday for the last time christine karpeles put her arms around 
several coworkers and announced loudly to camera crews were 
going to disneyland 
but her misty eyes betrayed the smile on her face as she 
mimicked the sports heroes who are paid to shout the same 
promotional phrase after winning a championship 
for most of the 5300 employees of the collapsed securities 
giant this was their worst day 
in letters to thousands of workers let go friday the company 
said it had failed despite herculean efforts to obtain additional 
capital 
drexels parent company filed for bankruptcy court protection 
tuesday and is liquidating its operations 
by the dozens employees who hours earlier were told they were 
fired were emerging from its doors in the heart of the financial 
district with pained expressions 
i was crying because its sad karpeles 21 of new york 
said after waving goodbye to the building 
this is just the beginning the industry is falling apart 
everybody is going to be hurt by this said the secretary in 
corporate finance 
it felt like a wake said judy finn who pushed a shopping 
cart full of 350 worth of computer equipment for her daughter 
debbie who was fired as a supervisory analyst in the research 
department the company offered employees computer equipment and 
other odds and ends at bargain prices on the last day 
my daughters unemployed im very sad she said 
the younger finn said she saw no irony in a button junk 
bonds keep america fit which she wore on her blouse 
it had a great spirit she said of drexel 
it was pride for the company that kept most of the executives 
and analysts from talking to about a dozen reporters who drew 
angry glances from some workers outside drexels doors said 
analyst ken haim 26 the only one who would talk among about 60 
men in suits and ties who left drexel over a twohour period 
people seemed to feel more sadness that the company was gone 
than for their own plights haim said 
he said many workers blame the press for fanning the flames of 
distrust for the company after its leader michael milken was 
indicted on fraud and racketeering charges last year 
milken was widely credited with raising the company to fame and 
billiondollar profits through his role in the corporate takeover 
craze financed by risky highyield bonds 
one man walked out of the building loudly cursing rudolph 
giuliani the former federal prosecutor who led the investigation 
that resulted in criminal charges against milken and drexel 
but another analyst who asked that his name not be used blamed 
the downfall on some management mistakes made in the last year or 
so 
its a terrible thing it didnt have to happen he said

employees of the nations big three automakers 
will feel the financial pinch thats squeezing their companies as 
they watch their profitsharing checks shrivel or in chrysler 
corps case disappear 
the automakers reported 1989 earnings this week including the 
base for profitsharing calculations earnings on their us 
operations after all the arithmetic is done the big three will 
spend 937 percent less on profitsharing this year than they did 
last year 
theyd rather make the money im sure and pay it out said 
auto analyst joseph phillippi if shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york 
chrysler said tuesday it made 359 million during 1989 but that 
included a 309 million onetime gain from the sale of stock in 
mitsubishi motors corp and a onetime 557 million charge for 
closing two plants and other matters 
in sum the nations no 3 automaker didnt make enough money to 
trigger profitsharing formulas for hourly and some salaried 
employees or bonus provisions for upperlevel whitecollar workers 
about 443000 of gms hourly and salaried workers will get 50 
each in profitsharing the company said thursday the worlds 
largest automaker declined to say specifically how much it made in 
the united states other than to say only that gm was profitable in 
the market 
friday ford motor co announced that about 150000 of its 
hourly and salaried workers would receive profitsharing checks of 
about 1025 each next month ford said it earned 11 billion in 
the united states last year 
last year gm workers received 265 each in profitsharing 
chrysler employees got 720 apiece and eligible ford workers 
received 2800 each 
while fords payments this year are the largest among the big 
three they dont match what hondas employees received in 
november each of the 8800 employees at the four ohio plants 
operated by honda of america manufacturing inc received an average 
1600 in bonussharing payments said spokeswoman sharon van 
winkle the payments are based on worldwide profits from all 
operations of the japanese automaker 
there are no profitsharing provisions for manufacturing 
employees at the us factories of toyota motor corp mazda motor 
corp and nissan motor co ltd all of japan 
nor are there profitsharing programs at the gmtoyota venture 
in fremont calif called new united motor manufacturing inc or 
the chryslermitsubishi diamondstar motors corp plant in normal 
ill 
in all the big three will spend about 40 million in 
profitsharing payments this year compared with the 6041 million 
they laid out last year 
the decrease could affect contract talks between the united auto 
workers union and the big three automakers negotiations are 
expected to begin in july the contracts expire at midnight sept 
14 
ford obviously is in a decidedly advantageous position on a 
labor relations standpoint as a result of this phillippi said 
uaw president owen bieber said tuesday that although there would 
be no profitsharing for chrysler hourly employees at least 
there will be some equality of sacrifice and chrysler executives 
will have to go without bonuses as well 
there may be a problem at gm phillippi said 
the problem gm is going to have is the hourly guys get 50 and 
the executive bonus pool group is probably going to get a pretty 
sizeable check he said its only going to make sitting down 
at the bargaining table rather sticky

the securities and exchange commission filed 
fraud charges friday against bolar pharmaceutical co accusing the 
beleaguered generic drug manufacturer of making false and 
misleading disclosure statements 
the sec in a complaint filed at us district court in 
washington accused bolar of making misleading and inadequate 
disclosure to the investing public about an agreement with the food 
and drug administration to suspend shipment of some of its drugs 
the sec action the second against bolar in as many months also 
named former bolar president robert shulman last month the sec 
suspended trading in bolars securities for 10 days 
the sec accused bolar and shulman of violating the antifraud 
provisions of federal securities law which requires prompt and 
truthful disclosure of significant events regarding a company 
the civil complaint sought a court order barring bolar and 
shulman from further alleged violations 
the complaint alleged that bolar failed to disclose that it 
reached an agreement with the food and drug administration earlier 
this month to suspend shipment temporarily of all of its products 
until at least feb 6 
bolar agreed to the temporary shipment suspension pending an 
agreement with the fda to indefinitely withdraw its narrowrange 
therapeutic drugs with the potential for serious physical harm 
the sec alleged adding these facts were not disclosed to 
investors until feb 8 after trading in the securities of bolar 
was halted on the american stock exchange 
between the time the 10day trading suspension ended feb 5 
when bolar stock was trading a 1075 a share until trading on 
the amex was halted feb 7 227 million shares of bolar stock were 
traded and the price rose to 1312 per share according to the sec 
the copaigue nybased generic drug maker said friday it had 
no comment on the sec suit 
on jan 23 the sec suspended trading of bolar securities for 10 
days after allegations that the company falsified safety claims 
about a high blood pressure drug 
that suspension came after a house subcommittee disclosed a 
letter from bolars attorneys that indicated bolar apparently 
falsified documents about safety tests for its generic version of a 
popular antihypertension drug dyazide 
dyazide is a widely prescribed high blood pressure medication 
made by smithkline beecham there is no fda allegation against that 
drug 
in august the fda said it would seek to remove bolars version 
of dyazide claiming the drug maker may have misrepresented 
documentation and safety data bolar disputed the allegations 
however the house energy and commerce committees subcommittee 
on oversight and investigation disclosed a letter from attorneys 
for bolar that said the company appeared to have used false 
documents to fight government action against its generic form of 
dyazide

late in 1988 former us attorney rudolph 
giuliani gave drexel burnham lambert inc a choice plead guilty to 
securities crimes or face indictment on racketeering charges 
it was like he put a gun in the middle of the table and said 
i can shoot you or you can shoot yourself said a drexel 
junkbond executive who quit last year after 20 years at the firm 
many on wall street not only defenders of the investment 
goliath believe drexels fate was determined not last week when 
it defaulted on 100 million in debt but in december 1988 when it 
agreed to admit criminal behavior in six transactions and pay 650 
million in penalties 
prosecution under the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act threatened drexel with pretrial asset seizures 
that likely would have put the firm out of business on the spot 
by pleading guilty in the governments insider trading sweep 
drexel gained the right to keep peddling junk bonds underwriting 
stock and arranging mergers it avoided the lengthy public ordeal 
of a trial and further erosion of investor confidence 
but it was forced to sever ties with junk bond dynamo michael 
milken who led the firms rapid rise in the 1980s to the pinnacle 
of wall street it agreed to disembowel some profitable operations 
and permit microscope scrutiny by federal regulators that shackled 
some businesses 
if giulianis threat was no more than a bluff by a 
publicityfriendly prosecutor who went on to run unsuccessfully 
for mayor then drexel is no more and 5000 people are losing 
their jobs without proof that crimes were committed 
without a judge and a jury as soon as they brought rico 
charges they killed drexel a top executive at a rival wall 
street firm said last week they just chose a slow death instead 
of a fast one 
off wall street former prosecutors regulators and legal 
experts said the theory of government culpability in drexels 
demise is an attempt to turn the perpetrator into a victim the 
pursuit of drexel may have been aggressive but the firm admitted to 
the crimes alleged and the governments case was strong they said 
do the bestpaid and most articulate defense attorneys advise 
clients to plead guilty and pay 650 million in fines in response 
to an empty threat said michael goldsmith a rico expert and law 
professor at brigham young university 
when youre indicted for fraud thats going to affect your 
business he said surely these companies arent suggesting 
they shouldnt be indicted for fraud 
after settling last year drexel halved its work force dumped 
businesses and restructured top management in an effort to compete 
as a mediumsized firm but without milken leading the firms 
beverly hills calif junk bond division drexels preeminence in 
the lucrative field began to falter and some clients steered clear 
because of its tarnished reputation 
the assessment at the commission was that if it could not 
operate in an honest fashion it should not operate said david 
ruder the securities and exchange commssion chairman during the 
drexel case 
the sec complaint is a very strong indictment of the way 
they did business there he said our effort was to reform that 
operation there was always some doubt about whether once reformed 
it would work 
in filing for bankruptcy protection last week drexels parent 
said it was hurt by a capital shortage partly created by a decline 
in the highyield bond market milken helped create analysts said 
that pointed out problems in relying on one product to sustain a 
financial services business 
as drexels problems came to a head government regulators 
refused to step in and ask banks to provide drexel with enough 
money to keep it alive officials in washington said they 
determined that drexels elimination would not have a serious 
impact on the nations financial markets 
i think it was clear from the outset of the investigation that 
drexel might not survive because the investigation went to the 
heart of their business said former sec enforcement director 
gary lynch who spearheaded the drexel probe 
the settlement gave them every chance at survivial he 
said unfortunately for the firm there was a general 
deterioration in the junk market that obviously hurt them 
in addition drexel insiders say that the firm embarked on 
several shaky deals in the postmilken era that bore the sign of 
quantity not quality and further eroded its reputation a 
general slump in the securities industry didnt help either 
milken has been charged in a 98count racketeering and fraud 
indictment in connection with drexels underlying crimes as well 
as others but has yet to go on trial his friends claim that if 
he is acquitted then drexels passing was for naught since he was 
the supposed architect of drexels crimes 
the theory of government blame holds sway with many drexel 
employees who remained loyal to the firm and defensive to the 
outside world in the face of the scandals we were really screwed 
by the government ken haim a 26yearold drexel debt analyst 
said after he was fired on friday 
detractors claim the government was on a witch hunt in its 
ballyhooed crackdown on whitecollar crime the wall street 
journal a forceful critic of the rico law said in an editorial 
last week that its now clear that the collapse of drexel was 
decided in the prosecutorial hothouse of the late 1980s 
most notable was mr giulianis decision to not merely bring 
traditional charges against mr milken and drexel but to use 
rico the journal said it didnt matter that the rico law was 
designed by congress explicitly for the mafia or that this would 
somehow morally equate investment banking with loan sharking and 
murder 
but goldmsith said to a degree it relects wall streets bias 
against rico i suppose the fear that they have is there but for 
the grace of god go i

regulators on friday seized franklin savings 
association of ottawa kan the states largest thrift and one of 
the few sampls to participate heavily in the futures markets 
to protect depositors the office of thrift supervision said it 
was turning the institution over to the resolution trust corp 
franklin was operating in an unsafe and unsound condition 
likely to cause insolvency or a substantial dissipation of 
assets the thrift office said 
with 114 billion in assets at the end of december it was the 
largest thrift in kansas it was the 21st biggest sampl in the 
nation according to sheshunoff information services inc of 
austin texas 
franklin has 47 billion in 154423 deposit accounts 
regulators said its nine branches would remain open and all 
deposits would be protected up to the 100000 insurance limit 
the institution specialized in a complex financial strategy in 
which it accepted highrate deposits from wall street brokers and 
invested them in mortgagebacked securities using futures 
contracts to protect itself from swings in interest rates 
however the thrift office said the strategy didnt work and the 
sampl was hit hard by a change in interest rates 
frankly im very suprised their entire strategy was based on 
protecting franklin from interest rate risk and they had a very 
sophisticated system for doing that said henry peltz an analyst 
with keefe bruyette and woods in new york 
the announcement came one day after the publicly traded sampl 
disclosed that regulators were conducting what it called a routine 
examination of its operations franklin vice chairman john 
scowcroft had assured reporters that the thrift was not in danger 
of becoming insolvent 
franklin was seized under a provision of the sampl law enacted 
last august that permits regulators to step in to prevent an 
institution from dissipating its assets or engaging in unsafe and 
unsound practices thrift office spokesman william fulwider said 
although franklin met its net worth requirement as of dec 31 
regulators ordered it to book further losses that would deplete all 
of its tangible capital and saw no reasonable prospect that it 
could raise the capital fulwider said 
franklin and regulators were involved in an accounting dispute 
centering on the treatment of 119 million in deferred losses from 
the futures market which the institution planned to take over five 
years 
if a heavy loss depressed franklins net worth below regulatory 
requirements the thrift had an agreement with zerocoupon bond 
holders that would trigger an even larger reduction in net worth 
on thursday franklin reported a net profit of 3 million or 8 
cents a share in its second quarter ended dec 31 compared with a 
loss of 215 million in the same quarter of 1988 
it also announced a management shakeup in which william j 
marshall was named president and chief executive officer replacing 
duane h hall 
the rtc said it appointed john carr as franklins managing 
agent he is the former chief executive officer of gibraltar 
savings of beverly hills calif the agency also is hiring two 
firms hyperion capital management inc and ranieri wilson amp co 
inc to advise it on how to handle franklins securities and 
futures portfolio 
founded in 1889 as the ottawa mutual loan and savings 
association franklin mounted a rapidgrowth strategy that relied 
excessively on highcost deposits from money brokers the thrift 
office said as of dec 31 70 percent of its deposits came from 
brokers 
their problem was they had a very high interest expense one 
of the highest in the business said kenneth h thomas a 
financial institutions analyst in miami he noted that the sampl also 
had a big junk bond portfolio 247 million at the end of 
september the 11th largest in the country 
franklins parent firm franklin savings corp owns 92 percent 
of thrifts stock while 55 percent of the stock is traded 
publicly in the overthecounter market 
franklin officials declined to comment on the seizure directing 
questions to the institutions government managers

a 270 million buyout offer for the 
company that publishes the st petersburg times one of the souths 
most prominent newspapers was flatly rejected friday by trustees 
who told an investor group led by texas billionaire robert m bass 
that the newspaper was not for sale 
the bass group responded immediately by saying the fight with 
the times wasnt over 
trustees of the poynter institute a journalism school that owns 
controlling stock in times publishing co voted unanimously to 
turn down the bid made last month the company publishes the 
newspaper and congressional quarterly 
the trustees carefully considered the institutes educational 
purpose and concluded it was better to own a newspaper than a stack 
of treasury bills said andrew barnes chairman of the board of 
trustees and editor president and chief executive of the newspaper 
the institutes ownership interest in the times is not for 
sale barnes said 
the institute was set up by the late nelson poynter who ran the 
paper for 30 years before his death in 1978 
in light of previous statements by mr barnes and his unique 
capacity to make decisions for both the times publishing co and 
the institute this announcement is not unexpected said david 
bonderman a general partner and spokesman for the texas investors 
through a complicated ownership plan the notforprofit school 
ultimately is the majority stockholder of the newspaper some 
shares are owned by poynters widow marion who endorsed the 
institutes action calling it the only decision that could have 
been made 
nelson spent the better part of a lifetime assembling defenses 
against assaults such as these mrs poynter said 
just because the attacks have become more sophisticated and 
the weapons goldplated there is no reason to give up the battle 
for independence integrity and commitment to the larger 
community 
the bass group which bought a minority stake in the company 
from disgruntled poynter heirs in mid1988 offered 270 million 
90000 for each of 3000 shares of common stock 
the partnership controls 200 shares or 40 percent of the 
voting stock which earns 57 percent of the companys dividends 
in another action the bass group has filed suit in federal 
court for a bigger share of the dividends which they claim arent 
fairly distributed in breach of fiduciary trust to stockholders 
as fiduciaries for all of the common shareholders the board 
of times publishing simply cannot pay dividends of 37 million per 
year on preferred stock owned by only one of the common 
shareholders when the company can redeem the preferred stock at any 
time for 318000 bonderman said 
the issue remains and we will of course continue to pursue 
its resolution by whatever means are available to us bonderman 
said

two black investors who claimed a cable 
television company failed to live up to a minority setaside clause 
in its agreement with the city have agreed to a settlement that 
could be worth 100 million 
united cable television corp of baltimore agreed to the 
settlement monday midway through a trial brought by the two 
investors 
the plaintiffs contended that the cable company blocked them and 
other minority investors from obtaining a 25 percent ownership 
interest in the franchise as required by the special setaside 
provision of the original franchise won from the city 
the two investors clarence elder a baltimore businessman and 
o patrick scott a prince georges county public school art 
teacher will receive an immediate 87 million lumpsum payment 
in addition united cable will transfer to them more than 2100 
units or shares in uniteds investment partnership that 
underwrites the cable system 
those units in addition to 311 they already own could be worth 
up to 923 million by 1995 if scott and elder decide to sell them 
that year according to court estimates cited by attorneys for 
scott and elder 
united cable officials put the total settlement figure at about 
50 million 
by whatever measure the result is a great one said stephen 
snyder chief attorney for scott and elder 
under the settlement approved by baltimore circuit judge hilary 
caplan snyders baltimore law firm snyder mehlman and wais will 
receive 40 percent of the cash and stock paid out to scott and 
elder 
in agreeing to the settlement united cable acknowledged no 
wrongdoing 
it was a business dispute and thats the way we looked at it 
from the beginning said john neal a vice president of united 
artists entertainment co the denverbased parent of united cable 
elder and scott claimed in their lawsuit that united cable 
resorted to various subterfuges to limit minority ownership 
interest in the franchise to about 35 percent rather than the 25 
percent required by the city 
neal said the ownership issue was clouded by varying 
interpretations of the franchise agreement and by the inability 
of black investors to raise the money in the full amount for 
their 25 percent interest

hit with a doublewhammy of lower revenue 
projections and an order by the state of washington to stop 
breaking wage laws nordstrom inc stock fell 92 percent friday 
from 3250 to 2950 per share 
the retail chain announced thursday that its fourthquarter 
earnings to be released in a few days will be lower than earnings 
for the same period a year earlier 
also thursday the state department of labor and industries 
ordered nordstrom to pay two years worth of unpaid overtime to its 
hourly employees in washington state a decision that eventually 
could affect all 30000 employees of the department store operator 
nationwide 
ruling on a complaint filed by locals 1001 and 367 united food 
and commercial workers in seattle and tacoma the state labor 
department found that nordstrom violated the state minimum wage act 
nordstrom could be liable for 40 million in claims and 
penalties in washington state alone and for 300 million in 
california local 1001 president joe peterson said friday at a news 
conference the union did not immediately provide projections for 
possible claims in other states 
peterson said a classaction suit on behalf of nordstrom 
employees nationwide would be filed against the chain if it doesnt 
comply with the state order 
bruce nordstrom cochairman of the companys board of 
directors said in a friday news release we will be reviewing 
our recordkeeping procedures and making any necessary backpay 
adjustments for those washington employees who may be affected by 
the departments findings 
however comments by the union representatives about the 
financial impact of those pay adjustments are purely speculative 
and we believe greatly overstated 
according to the labor department and the union nordstrom 
consistently encourages employees to volunteer their time for such 
activities as attending company meetings preparing paperwork and 
inventory and making customer deliveries 
the department ordered nordstrom to start proper recordkeeping 
for the hours its employees works and offer back pay to those who 
have put in unpaid overtime 
nordstrom is doing a disservice to its reputation employees 
and stockholders by continuing to deny that they have a culture 
that requires employees to work without pay peterson said friday 
the alleged practice forces employees to work unpaid hours to 
improve their sales per hour he said those who dont participate 
see their hours cut and dont get promoted he claimed 
the technique he added gives nordstrom an unfair competitive 
advantage 
nordstrom has a great reputation for customer service and 
merchandising there is no reason why they cant continue to be 
that but like other employers pay their employees he said 
nordsrom spokeswoman kellie tormey said friday that any 
implication that employees who dont work unpaid overtime arent 
promoted is absolutely false 
she also said nordstrom had always provided employees with extra 
pay for extra work and if that werent the case she asked 
rhetorically why did so many employees stay with the company 
the union has collected 450 claims for 21 million in back pay 
and expects more now because of the state order peterson said 
marcia raley who follows nordstrom for the dain bosworth inc 
brokerage in minneapolis said she thinks the earnings projection 
is more responsible for the market decline than the labor 
department order however she said nordstroms response to the 
order will make a difference in the future 
she estimated that nordstroms fourthquarter earnings per share 
were 48 cents down from 58 cents a year earlier her guess on 
yearend results is 147 a share down from 151 a year earlier 
nordstrom has 60 stores in washington california oregon utah 
virginia and alaska it plans 16 more stores in oregon california 
new jersey illinois maryland minnesota indiana connecticut 
massachusetts and new york 
the seattlebased chain closely held by the nordstrom family 
has prospered in recent years in part because of its reputation for 
customer service
