a former state representative got a 
6year prison term and an exstate senator was given six months at 
a halfway house monday the first sentences handed out after a 
federal probe of bribery at the statehouse 
the probe has led to bribery charges against nine lawmakers and 
drug charges against a 10th lawmaker and a lobbyist 
former state rep luther taylor brought great shame on elected 
officials and the citizens of this state such that it would cause 
all of us to hang our heads in shame for letting it come into 
being us district judge falcon hawkins said at a sentencing 
hearing 
hawkins gave taylor the maximum prison term allowed under 
federal sentencing guidelines earlier monday he sentenced former 
state sen rick lee who also was charged with selling his vote 
taylor 41 a democrat was convicted in october of six counts 
of violating the hobbs act a federal antibribery law 
he was charged with conspiring to solicit bribes and with 
accepting a total of 4300 from a lobbyistturnedfbi informant in 
exchange for supporting a bill allowing betting on horse and dog 
racing in south carolina 
taylor was taken into custody after hawkins rejected a defense 
motion to let taylor remain free on bond pending his appeal 
joel collins taylors attorney said after the hearing that 
taylor knew he might be sentenced to prison i think he accepted 
the news as well as anyone can 
lee 37 a republican avoided a prison time because of his 
cooperation with prosecutors in the investigation of statehouse 
corruption in addition to his sixmonth term in a halfway house 
lee received five years probation and will have to pay 3000 in 
restitution 
federal sentencing guidelines would have allowed hawkins to 
sentence lee to up to 27 months in prison 
lee and three other former legislators pleaded guilty in august 
to accepting a 2000 bribe from a lobbyist for his work on behalf 
of the parimutuel betting bill the four all had resigned from the 
legislature when they were indicted in august 
im very appreciative of the judges sentencing and the work 
my attorney did lee said afterward im very thankful at being 
sentenced to a halfway house where i can work and contribute to my 
familys wellbeing that in itself is a blessing

the magellan spacecraft found evidence that 
volcanoes may be erupting to this day on venus and that they gushed 
an australiasized flood of lava in recent geological times 
the spacecrafts new radar pictures of the cloudcovered planet 
suggest that at any given time venus is active in several 
regions said roger phillips a scientist at southern methodist 
university in dallas venus is not dead 
magellans pictures show there are no meteorite impact craters 
in an australiasized portion of the planet phillips said monday 
during a meeting of the american geophysical union 
that means the huge area is covered by lava that was deposited 
sometime within the last tens of millions of years relatively 
recent in geological terms phillips said 
it raises the likelihood venus is still active he added 
magellan hasnt yet found direct proof that volcanoes are 
erupting today on the planet to accomplish that magellan must fly 
over the same parts of venus twice and look for differences caused 
by any active lava flows 
and that wont happen until next spring 
magellan was launched from a shuttle in may 1989 went into 
orbit around venus on aug 10 and started maing maps and pictures 
in september 
as of monday magellan had orbited venus 847 times it bounces 
radar off the planets surface to make images

once a shoefactory town with vacant 
storefronts this village has become a veritable shopping nirvana 
though it has only 7500 residents freeport boasts 110 outlet 
stores 65 in a sevenblock area of downtown alone including 
such wellknown names as ll bean dansk and j crew 
freeports unusual range of stores has enabled it to weather the 
recession better than most other towns in maine and other new 
england states business and government officials say 
its the disney world of shopping right here said jclyn 
mclennan manager of the mikasa outlet store i havent felt the 
hurt of the economy ive heard a lot about it but i havent felt 
it or seen it 
but the retailing success has come at a price 
some longtime residents complain the town is so clogged with 
traffic it can take a halfhour to drive from one end to the other 
and they say the outlet stores cater to tourists and dont carry 
the products such as groceries needed for daily living 
i think it stinks said betty wentworth 69 who has lived 
in freeport since 1952 theyve got a lot of stores but retired 
people or people of an average income cant afford to shop there 
as mrs wentworth talked in her kitchen on a recent fall day 
kathleen brodie of northboro mass hunted for bargains a 
halfmile away in downtown freeport 
im on my way home from canada she said i made an effort 
to leave canada early so id have time to come by here 
brodie who treks to freeport about four times a year said many 
of the towns outlets sell merchandise at prices at least 25 
percent lower than similar stores in boston 
a block away meg and kate schwartz sisters from brielle nj 
marveled at freeports array of stores the stores dont look 
like outlet warehouses they look like regular stores said meg 
21 its a nice atmosphere and a pretty town 
the town has capitalized on two retailing trends the popularity 
of outlet shopping and the american pastime of shopping as 
recreation said beth gleason executive director of the freeport 
merchants association 
the american people are becoming savvier consumers looking for 
the best bargain gleason said the other thing is that 
shopping has become a family event that replaces other forms of 
recreation 
thats why freeport has been such a success she said we 
also have ll bean which is unique in the world 
the companys namesake ll bean began selling hunting shoes 
by mail in 1912 he later added other clothing for hunting such as 
wool shirts and socks 
as people started receiving the catalog they decided they 
wanted to stop in here in freeport said company spokesman kilton 
andrew there wasnt any store there people would just meet them 
at the door and take them to the areas where they stocked the 
merchandise and sell them what they wanted 
then people started showing up in the middle of the night and 
they literally rousted ll out of bed he said 
so in the 1930s bean set aside space for a retail store and 
kept it open roundtheclock every day of the year after beans 
death in 1967 at age 94 his grandson leon a gorman expanded the 
business taking its appeal beyond hunters and fishermen to 
outdoors enthusiasts of all types 
but as beans business grew freeports economic heart shoe 
manufacturing began to slump in the early 1980s 
town manager dale olmstead recalls that when he first moved to 
freeport in 1982 the downtown was quite rundown 
things began looking up in the summer of 1982 when dansk opened 
the first namebrand outlet in downtown freeport 
apparently andrew said the wizards of the where do you 
put stores business decided this was a happening place and boom 
look what happened as the 80s heated up business in freeport 
just grew and grew freeport has achieved critical mass as a 
shopping destination 
word of freeports shopping attractions quickly spread along the 
tour bus and tourist circuit 
when promoting maine gleason said tourism officials will 
sell lobsters the beautiful rocky coast of maine and theyll 
sell ll bean 
bus tours if they can fit it in their itinerary will always 
stop in freeport she said ive seen as many as 16 to 30 buses 
in here on a busy day 
i think weve weathered the recession better than other 
communities said olmstead the town manager 
mrs wentworth and her husband ran a dry cleaning service on 
main street from 1953 until they sold their building in 1984 at the 
start of the outlet boom 
paul wentworth acknowledges the couple made a tidy profit on the 
sale but still laments what the outlet boom has done to life in 
freeport 
they dont sell the products you need for everyday life since 
this commercial explosion started he said 
like other freeport residents the wentworths must drive eight 
miles north to brunswick or five miles south to yarmouth to shop in 
a supermarket 
the couple lives a halfmile from the center of town but say 
its easier to walk downtown than drive because of the traffic 
congestion 
on a weekend you might run out of gas driving around trying 
to find a parking place wentworth said with a rueful laugh 
there are so many ways it isnt the same town anymore mrs 
wentworth said with a sigh i think its just been a lot of 
hassle

is it better for a pop star to look good than to 
sound good in the age of mtv it certainly cant hurt as 7 
million milli vanilli fans found out 
but fans of rob and fab the pretty boy dancers who fronted as 
milli vanilli are not alone in discovering their chartclimbing 
stars have more in common with the wizard of oz than with prince 
the voices behind technotronics pump up the jam and 
blackboxs everybody everybody are not necessarily the tall 
luscious models featured on album covers and videos they are two 
less videogenic women behind the scenes 
welcome to the modern pop jungle where big or butch women 
dont satisfy mtvs lust the village voice said recently in a 
piece on the lipsynch flap 
the question is not limited to whos singing on the record 
theres also the question of whos singing on stage the use of 
taped music and vocals in live performances is rumored for many 
artists including madonna and new kids on the block 
certainly in this video generation of the past 10 years 
having a band or an artist with the look is critically important 
acknowledged abbey konowitch mtvs senior vice president it 
doesnt have to be goodlooking but it has to be a look 
and the vanillis 
im sure a great part of milli vanillis success is due to the 
fact theyre unusual greatlooking guy said konowitch 
such talk annoys veteran rocker graham nash whos combined with 
david crosby and stephen stills to provide some of the finest vocal 
harmonies ever recorded 
its totally preposterous if you cant cut it dont do it 
nash said of the seenbutnotheard bands lipsynching might be 
ok at the ice capades when youre doing the march of the teenage 
mutant ninja turtles but not at a rock n roll show 
the importance of appearance in pop music is nothing new the 
beatles arrived in the united states with matching haircuts and 
wardrobe 26 years ago the sex pistols arrived a generation later 
with clothes to match their attitudes 
but the mtv generation has placed a new emphasis on looks the 
diminutive baseballcapped ya kid k the voice of technotronics 
pump up the jam was replaced in the video by lanky model 
felly 
martha wash who says she is the voice on blackboxs hit single 
everybody everybody instead saw 6foot model katrin quinol on 
the cover of the 12inch single 
we have been told katrin is part of the group but in no way 
was she the only female voice said marilyn lipsius a bmg 
records spokeswoman martha definitely sang on it and nobody 
ever denied that 
wash is suing rca records bmgs parent company over the song 
says her attorney steven ames brown she has a similar suit 
pending against aampm records alleging her vocals were ripped off by 
the group seduction on im your one and only he said 
a spokesman for rca said the company would have a response but 
never produced one 
the vanillis were lean mean dancing machines wash on the 
other hand was onehalf of two tons of fun the hefty backup 
singers for the late sylvester and a successful duet as the weather 
girls 
america is about pretty surfaces says music publicist bill 
adler if it were simply about musical talent bo diddley would 
be a lot bigger than elvis 
things have been popping since the millis were exposed and 
stripped of their grammy copies of their records were destroyed 
lawsuits alleging fraud have been filed by fans in california and 
chicago lawmakers in massachusetts new york new jersey and 
michigan are considering legislation over live performance 
lipsynching 
yet producer frank farian the mastermind behind the fabulous 
faker boys offered no apologies and neither did their record 
company 
it was a wonderful act fans loved the music everybody was 
happy farian said before the split hit their fans 
the millis were particularly criticized for lypsynching live 
but they dont stand alone highenergy choreographed shows by 
janet jackson or the new kids on the block leave the singers 
gasping for air several such acts are rumored to enhance their 
shows with prerecorded sound 
nash says csns chances of making it big in todays music 
business would be slim unlike his hefty singing partner crosby 
crosby has style well a certain style for sure but not 
stacked boots and all that he said laughing 
im not sure how artists from the past would fare said 
adler i mean bob dylans videos are kind of lame even though 
hes electrifying in person

zhou lihong seven months pregnant has no home 
of her own and shares a tiny room in a company dormitory with two 
other women her husband who works for the same firm lives 
upstairs 
the company offered part of an old house that had no gas heat 
or plumbing but the young couple rejected it gambling that a 
better offer would come they have no guarantees 
while the zhous wait and hope suitable apartments are empty 
one is in the name of yan fields a chinese woman who followed 
her american husband to the united states four years ago and rents 
for the equivalent of just 1 a month 
it is too valuable to give up and her parents dont want to 
sublet for fear of attracting attention that might cause them to 
lose the apartment 
housing problems are most acute in the major cities officials 
said onefourth of beijings residents lack adequate 
acccommodations 
an apartment shortage is not the entire problem the system of 
housing distribution through employers lends itself to inequities 
and abuse 
government programs have had limited success in improving the 
situation 
in 1988 a few cities began raising rents and selling apartments 
to tenants to finance construction of more housing but the reforms 
have not been applied nationwide many local officials blocked 
them unwilling to pay the higher rents or lose the power they get 
from assigning scarce apartments 
housing officials insist the reforms have not been abandoned 
they say 30 counties and 19 cities including parts of beijing 
shanghai and canton are following the new policies on a limited 
scale 
nearly everyone in china has a roof over his head but he shares 
it with many more people than americans do 
the average living area for a chinese is 81 square feet 
according to government figures in the united states says the 
national association of homebuilders the average person has 755 
square feet 
a shanghai newspaper wrote about a couple who lived in a single 
room with an aging father 
after four years of marriage they remained childless and the 
husband was convinced lack of privacy was the reason they borrowed 
an apartment for five months and the wife became pregnant 
employers determine whether a young couple get their own 
apartment companies distribute housing by seniority and both 
husband and wife have a chance to be assigned an apartment by their 
respective employers 
a worker who has connections to the company housing official may 
get a larger apartment than he needs rents are so low there is no 
reason not to obtain as much space as possible 
rents for an average threeroom apartment in beijing range from 
the equivalent of 34 cents a month to 114 
officials say the average chinese spends less than 1 percent of 
his income on housing compared with 15 percent in the united 
states in the late 1950s chinese spent 6 percent to 10 percent of 
income on rent and officials want to return to that level by the 
end of this decade 
rent is so low that it takes years to recover a new 
buildings cost said zhang yuanduan director of the construction 
ministrys real estate department 
most new buildings soon begin deteriorating because rent often 
doesnt even pay the cost of maintenance and chinese are being 
born at the rate of more than 30 a minute too fast for new 
construction to keep pace 
in outlying parts of beijing and some companies where the 
housing reforms are being introduced rents have risen to the 
equivalent of 630 a month for a threeroom apartment 
the city built 314 new apartments and offered them for sale at 
prices much closer to the real cost an average of 18250 or 40 
times the average annual wage said liu qi deputy director of 
beijings housing reform office 
buyers snapped up the apartments borrowing money from relatives 
abroad or taking out bank loans 
liu said some companies in beijing were following suit and had 
sold nearly 4000 apartments to workers in the past two years 
generally at lower prices than the city proceeds are used to 
renovate old housing and build new apartments 
a local government in liaoning northeastern china earned 
enough from selling apartments and raising rents to build 120 new 
dormitories in less than three years in the past it had been able 
to build only one or two in the same period said zhang of the 
construction ministry

aaron copland the pioneering 
composer who used folk songs and jazz in writing plainspoken 
classics such as appalachian spring lincoln portrait and 
billy the kid died sunday at age 90 
copland who lived in peekskill died at phelps memorial 
hospital in westchester from pneumonia with respiratory failure 
following two recent strokes hospital spokeswoman ann marie 
treanor said sunday night 
admired by colleagues as the dean of american music copland 
was a major force in gaining international recognition for the 
nations 20th century composers his honors included a pulitzer 
prize a presidential medal of freedom the guggenheim foundations 
first music fellowship and an oscar 
vivian perlis with whom he wrote his memoir said copland had 
the unusual ability to reach a wide audience and at the same time 
he composed some of the masterworks of the century that were highly 
respected by other musicians 
she added he put american music on the map he decided that 
there should be an american sound a place for the american 
composer 
among his better known works were the score for the red 
pony the 1949 movie based on the novel by john steinbeck and 
lincoln portrait music performed with narration inspired by 
the writing of carl sandberg 
other noted pieces included fanfare for the common man 
written in 1942 
he was the composer who would lead american music out of the 
wilderness the late leonard bernstein wrote in high fidelity 
magazine for the occasion of coplands 70th birthday he was the 
leader the one to whom the young always came with their 
compositions 
composer william schumann said he copland and bernstein were 
close friends for many years and formed a triumvirate among 
american composers 
i think aaron created the american sound in symphonic music 
schumann said he has not only been for a halfcentury the 
preeminent american composer but a remarkable force as an 
influence with younger composers 
he added copland believed in the validity of american music 
and that we were not inferior to our european cousins 
copland wrote two operas six ballets and eight film scores 
including his oscarwinning music for william wylers the 
heiress in 1948 he was a pianist conductor author and 
educator guiding numerous musicians including bernstein 
copland won his pulitzer and the new york music critics circle 
award in 1945 for appalachian spring which he wrote for martha 
graham to accompany her choreography based on a hart crane poem 
among the compositions most famous themes a shaker melody played 
by clarinet and followed by five variations 
his ballets billy the kid and rodeo also combined cowboy 
tunes and folk songs with original themes 
despite his success copland stopped composing after 1967 
spending much of his time at his home and directing recordings of 
his works 
one reason for his decision to stop composing was the rejection 
by young composers of his inscape his first attempt at the 
highly structured atonal 12tone system 
born nov 14 1900 copland was the youngest of five children 
his parents immigrants from eastern europe owned a neighborhood 
department store in brooklyn 
coplands maternal grandfather aaron mittenthal moved to 
dallas and opened a dry goods store there in the 1870s according 
to copland family lore jesse james brother frank worked in the 
store attracting customers but stealing the profits forcing 
mittenthal to eeturn to new york 
perlis coauthor of his 1984 memoir copland suggests that 
lineage is one reason a jewish boy from brooklyn could write cowboy 
music though he did not travel to the west until he was 28 
copland provided his own explanation i preferred to imagine 
being on a horse without actually getting on one 
his first work was a song composed at about age 8 for his 
mother about three years later he gave up after two pages of 
music for opera zenatello act i his first complete work was 
a song lola written at age 14 
but coplands parents were reluctant to pay for music lessons 
my parents were of the opinion that enough money had been 
invested in the musical training of the four older children with 
meager results he once recalled 
coplands persistence prevailed at 16 he began harmony lessons 
with rubin goldmark who taught another brooklynite george 
gershwin 
in 1920 copland was the first to be accepted to the french 
governments summer music school for americans at the palace of 
fontainbleau he studied harmony in paris with nadia boulanger and 
sold a composition the cat and the mouse for 3250 
to finally see my music printed means more to me than any 
debut in carnegie hall he wrote home 
copland was part of a talented group of americans who studied 
with boulanger including virgil thompson walter piston roy 
harris david diamond and elliott carter who remembered copland on 
sunday night as being extremely helpful to his musical 
colleagues 
the brightest musical light in paris when copland was there was 
igor stravinsky whose pounding primitive ballet the rite of 
spring caused a riot at its 1913 premiere 
copland was struck by stravinskys use of russian folk material 
i have no doubt that this strongly influenced me to try to find a 
way to a distinctively american music 
in 1923 boulanger introduced copland to serge koussevitzky who 
would take over the boston symphony orchestra the next year 
copland played his cortege macabre on the piano and composer 
serge prokofiev who was also at the house blurted out too much 
bassi ostinati 
however koussevitzky promised to conduct the piece in boston 
and asked copland to compose an organ concerto for boulanger a 
shaken copland later asked his teacher do you really think i can 
do it 
she pointed a finger at me you can do it and when 
mademoiselle said you can do it that was the end of the 
discussion copland recalled 
copland returned to new york in 1924 to complete the symphony 
for organ and orchestra which boulanger premiered in new york in 
1925 at her us debut 
afterward copland recalled conductor walter damrosch addressed 
the audience ladies and gentlemen i am sure you will agree that 
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 
within five years he will be ready to commit murder 
copland laughed along with the audience but for years damrosch 
worried whether the composer understood he was joking 
the same year copland won the first guggenheim fellowship in 
music worth 2500 
koussevitzky commissioned coplands music for the theatre 
and introduced his piano concerto both jazzinspired 
compositions 
the concerto written in 1926 used frequently changing rhythms 
i felt i had gone to the extreme of where jazz could take me the 
audiences and critics in boston all thought i had gone too far 
copland recalled 
in 1928 during his first trip to the west copland heard the 
piece hissed during rehearsal and again in concert at the hollywood 
bowl 
his 1942 rodeo launched agnes demille in her dancing career 
copland also helped organize cos cob press which published 
music of composers rejected by established publishers he founded 
the young composers group which helped thompson bernard herrmann 
and others 
copland never married and left no survivors 
an old friend the late playwright harold clurman once told 
perlis that the only ambition i ever heard him remark on was i 
want to be remembered

rossinis semiramide returned to the 
metropolitan opera where it was last heard in 1895 
mezzosoprano marilyn horne portrying a man and bass samuel 
ramey are masters of this kind of florid singing with enough vocal 
flexibility to trill three notes where operas written later would 
have one note 
despite the debut of lella cuberli with her delicate voice in 
the title role friday it was hornes and rameys night especially 
hornes she conveyed not only lush secure sound but the assurance 
she knows what the music in this 1823 opera is all about 
cuberli is from austin texas and a graduate of southern 
methodist university she has been specializing in rossini roles 
mainly in europe and regularly at la scala since 1975 semiramide 
gives her one of the most beautiful arias in opera 
chris merritt a tall large tenor from oklahoma city who 
attended oklahoma city university also made his met debut he has 
specialized in bel canto operas by rossini bellini and donizetti 
mostly in europe his voice is warm and very attractive in its 
middle register it thins out when he sings high though he can hit 
the top notes 
young ok shin from korea also made her met debut 
the vocal range required for performers in semiramide makes 
it pointless to present if an adequate cast cant be assembled 
this cast is better than just capable in voice style and stamina 
gaetano rossi based the libretto on a tragedy by voltaire 
semiramide queen of babylon had a prince ramey kill her husband 
15 years before he hopes to become king semiramide falls in love 
with a young army commander horne the high priest sung 
commendably by john cheek reveals that this is her son arsace 
arsace tries to kill the prince but his mother steps between them 
and dies the priest has the prince arrested arsace becomes king 
arias and duets are long so stage action is static 
john copleys new production is beautiful michael stennett has 
designed lots of goldencrusted costumes without aiming for a 
certain period

at age 59 brand is the oldest person to fly in space he said 
columbia probably will be his last flight 
ill probably move on to a management job a second career if 
you will at this late day but frankly there isnt anything that 
beats flying in space brand said in an interview earlier this 
year

for five or more years 
brand joined the astronaut corps in 1966 after serving in the 
marines as a naval aviator and working as a test pilot for lockheed

flight in november 1982 and the 10th shuttle flight in february 
1984 
although some astronauts have left the highflying career to 
assume management roles in the space agency or pursue other 
interests brand has been happy to stay and wait his turn for 
mission assignments 
i suppose a lot of people would do this until their 90 years 
old if they could he said 
but he conceded that the problem now is getting back in the long 
line again 
brand was born in longmont colo where he graduated from 
longmont high school he earned a bachelors degree in business and 
in aeronautical engineering from the university of colorado and a 
masters degree in business administration from the university of

that the most challenging part of the mission will be to get the 
observatory working 
im especially looking forward to the fun of going observing 
in space for a whole week he added

maybe columbus didnt really 
discover america the locals met him on the beach but he brought 
a hedge against cholesterol 500 years before everybody started 
worrying about it 
argentine ranchers believe criollos descendants of the hardy 
cattle columbus carried across the sea can be the basis of new 
crossbreeds that will produce leaner steaks for a dietconscious 
age 
columbus brought the first cattle to the new world on his 
second voyage in 1493 and more on his third and fourth trips 
said dr sol l rabasa a genetecist 
you can accurately say the animals that subsequently populated 
the americas from the texas longhorn in the north to what we call 
criollo cattle in latin america are their direct descendants 
rabasa is president of the 6yearold argentine criollo cattle 
breeders association which is rescuing criollos from 
nearextinction and breeds them on his ranch near villa canas 185 
miles west of buenos aires 
he said the criollo and its crossbreeds convert food to muscle 
efficiently and produce leaner meat with less marbled fat 
the spanish word criollo is used throughout latin america to 
denote people or animals born in the americas of european 
parentage 
despite nearly five centuries of independent development rabasa 
said the texas longhorn and argentine criollo have the same long 
angular shorthaired body and the same colors brown red or 
piebald 
carlos e dawney a rancher and association officer said the 
only real difference is in the horns that give the texas breed its 
name often 60 inches from tip to tip longer than ours 
rabasa believes columbus chose the cattle from the arid regions 
near spains southern ports selecting animals that were gentle 
for easy handling and hardy to stand the long trip in cramped 
quarters 
they were used to establish breeding herds on cuba and hispanola 
in the caribbean from there they were taken to mexico the 
isthmus of panama and to peru for distribution through spains 
south american colonies 
criollos arrived in argentina in the mid1500s and soon 
multiplied into tens of thousands on the pampa one of the worlds 
finest natural grazing lands 
argentina exported hides but there was no way to preserve meat 
for export and most of it was left to rot 
faster ships and use of salt as a preservative made ranching 
highly profitable by the 1830s to boost production cattlemen 
imported such fastergrowing british breeds as the hereford 
shorthorn and aberdeen angus 
zebu breeds from india slowgrowing and tough but resistant to 
heat and disease were introduced in semitropical northern 
argentina 
soon the criollo was seen as inferior and began to disappear 
absorbed by the herds of newcomers or banished to the least 
hospitable areas 
rabasa 75 is a former university rector noted for research he 
became interested in the criollos potential 20 years ago when 
ranchers asked him about the possibility of crossing it with zebu 
cattle 
i had to tell them i didnt know and we set out to find some 
evidence he said in an interview 
a herd of zebucriollo crossbreeds was discovered on a ranch in 
northwest chaco province and we found their production levels 
and meat quality were surprisingly good rabasa said 
years of research by rabasa and the national institute of 
agricultural technology followed crossing the criollo with zebu 
and british breeds 
studies showed the criollo still had the gentleness prized by 
columbus combined with superior fertility body structure that 
facilitates calving resistance to disease and good milk 
production rabasa said 
the criollo calf gets up as soon as it is born and begins to 
drink its mothers milk allowing the mother to pass more of her 
protective antibodies on to the calf during the first 24 hours 
he said the other breeds are slower to react and their calves 
receive fewer antibodies 
skin and eye pigmentation protect criollos and their crossbreeds 
from cancers conjunctivitis and other ailments provoked by the 
bright sunlight prevalent in much of the americas the geneticist 
said 
criollos also need water less often and can spend more time 
searching for food over a larger area making them ideal for 
marginal land 
rabasa and his associates began a search for pure criollos 
remaining in argentina 
they found them in pockets of the arid thornforested chaco and 
in la rioja a desert province a wild herd turned up in the 
glaciers national park of southern patagonias andean foothills 
about 185 miles from the strait of magellan 
registered criollo cattle now number between 1000 and 2000 and 
about 50 commercial herds use them as breeding stock 
rabasa said efforts to preserve criollo cattle are under way in 
other countries including the united states where a gread deal 
is being done

the curatolas owned a fixerupper with a 
romantic wraparound porch they had a jeepstyle car with the 
requisite two kids in back summer barbecues for friends and 
chirping crickets to serenade them at night 
it was a suburban dream and the new york couple hated it 
we had all these ideals about what we wanted in a home said 
gerry curatola rolling hills and country roads lots of acreage 
it was very romantic but it wasnt reality the suburbs werent 
home 
many middleclass families have chosen to move away from 
manhattan where violence is on the rise and everything else often 
seems in decline but for the curatolas the city was home crime 
dirt noise and all 
the most important element of anywhere you live is time 
together as a family curatola a dentist said recently 
thats the important priority not commuting fixing the house 
doing this or doing that 
curatola and his wife georgia moved back into the city last 
spring after fewer than four years in their westchester county 
dream house they couldnt take the good life any longer 
for every leisurely weekend in their backyard gerry had at 
least 10 new 1hour commutes notched on his briefcase for every 
pleasant morning with her husband georgia endured many long 
lonely afternoons 
i think women in particular are very affected by a move like 
that said mrs curatola whose young daughter and son provided 
her some relief i dont play tennis and i dont do clubs 
without those suburban mainstays she said the isolation 
sometimes was overwhelming her days were taken up in solitary 
journeys to the market the dry cleaners to her 6yearold 
daughters school 
on the upper west side of manhattan where the couple now lives 
neighbors meet on the elevator standing in line at the bank or at 
the deli theres always something to joke about central park is 
the familys backyard 
the curatolas know the streets are dangerous and that the public 
schools are a mess but they also know fifth avenues christmas 
lights the guggenheim museums art and carnegie halls music 
theres nothing like little italys pasta or the charm of greenwich 
village on a blustery fall day 
the curatolas want their children to experience the citys 
wonderful mishmash of ethnicities and eccentricities the very 
things the mitzners miss 
barbara and marvin mitzner both 44 had their child in mind 
when they moved to the new york suburb of pound ridge six years 
ago 
we thought the school systems were so excellent but they 
arent what theyre pumped up to be said mrs mitzner whose 
5yearold daughter is attending private school the local 
kindergarten was appalling 
the unsatisfactory schools wouldnt be so bad on their own mrs 
mitzner said but add in the many meals her huband arrives home too 
late to share the perpetual home repairs aloof neighbors the 
driving everywhere all the time 
pound ridge is a lovely lovely place but it isnt all 
its cracked up to be particularly for a couple that has grown up 
with the excitement of city life said marvin mitzner a partner 
at the new york law firm of davidoff amp malido 
getting out of the city didnt turn out to be what we thought 
it might he said adding that a lot of his friends shared 
similar feelings 
there are no statistics on the number of families abandoning the 
suburbs but the mitzners who have put their home on the market 
are among a group of suburbanites disillusioned by their 
experience 
demographers predicted two decades ago that the baby boomers 
would choose either rural or urban lifestyles this rebellious 
generation sociologists theorized would settle anywhere but in 
the suburbs where they were raised 
the experts were wrong when working couples started families in 
the 1980s many of those who could afford to opted for the suburbs 
as a practical compromise between city and country living 
its a forumula that hasnt worked for everyone 
we were making enough money where we wanted to make an 
investment said deborah hassan who with her husband chose the 
the new york suburb of scarsdale where the median home price is 
535000 within a month after we moved out there our neighbors 
put up a fence it felt so isolated 
before the year was out the hassans and their 3yearold 
daughter were back in manhattan its not easy living in the city 
with a kid said mrs hassan who works part time at american 
express 
but i have this feeling about the city she said theres 
always someone in the park for my daughter to play with

dr glenn fishman and his wife joanne 
wallenstein wanted to stick it out in new york but the city wore 
them down 
their car was broken into eight times in 12 months they were 
mugged hassled by homeless beggars frightened on the subway at 
night they didnt want to witness the final urban terror murder 
more than a home the couple and their two young children 
finally sought a haven here in this gabled suburb about 40 minutes 
from new york by train 
we feel bad abandoning the city said fishman a researcher 
at albert einstein college of medicine but the problems seem to 
be growing at such a clip that a lot of people are finding its 
a good time to make a move 
added his wife joanne its sad for the city 
there is much for the city to mourn statistics usually reserved 
for harlem and flatbush are touching safe neighborhoods it is 
more difficult for people to ignore the violence step over the 
many beggars in their path 
new yorks welfare caseload numbers 830000 greater than the 
population of all but americas 10 largest cities someone is 
robbed every six minutes and an average of 366 cars are stolen 
daily among the subway users about 200000 jump the turnstiles 
and ride free each day 
violence is reaching people it never reached before said 
ellen kaidanow 30 an executive recruiter for the gap inc 
it used to be that there were certain parts of manhattan where 
you felt relatively safe said mrs kaidanow who is looking for 
a suburban home where she and her husband can start a family now 
the violence could be anywhere 
it is this sense of randomness that drives many couples back to 
the secure relatively quiet suburban lifestyle they knew as 
children and in many cases swore off as young adults 
the us census bureau doesnt break down new york metropolitan 
area migration but suburban real estate agents say that weary 
urban couples looking for a change lately have given their slumping 
market a modest boost 
many think the city isnt getting any better and a lot 
think its going to get worse said merritt mitchell president 
of the westchester multiple listings service a lot of young 
couples are looking to get out 
but along with the contents of their apartments many exnew 
yorkers end up bringing a sense of guilt with them to the suburbs 
where homes start at about 175000 their consciences suggest it 
would be nobler to stay and fight for the citys future 
but you have to look at it from a standpoint of 
selfpreservation said marc tartell 36 advertising director at 
aampw brands inc things felt out of control 
as the tartells were packing up a moving van bound for 
westchester county in september someone stole two suitcases 
stuffed with their childrens baby clothes the theft was a final 
kick in the pants a reminder of why the longtime new yorkers were 
getting out 
i like city living i just dont like living in new york 
anymore said barbara tartell 31 a vice president at goldman 
sachs amp co the presence of undesirable people is becoming more 
obvious 
jobless angry addicted young people used to hang out near the 
tartells home on the upper west side their 3yearold son already 
was asking about prostitution crack cocaine and homelessness 
their new twostory fivebedroom colonial home is altogether 
different the kids have a backyard now trees to swing from a 
street made for kick the can and neighborhood pals ready to 
play such games 
local taxes are higher but the public schools in scarsdale 
arent overcrowded and underfunded like those in the city and the 
7500 kindergarten tuition the tartells faced in new york was 
anything but cheap 
new suburbanites say they wish their kids could grow up with the 
citys energy culture and diversity but those things mean 
nothing parents say if their children are frightened 
stressedout constantly on edge 
its a fight or flight situation said charlie clough an 
abstract artist who shares a greenwich village townhouse with his 
wife and their two young sons its palpabl these are real 
bullets going by 
clough and his wife liz trovato started thinking about a move 
after a sniper opened fire at their 10yearold sons little league 
game 
there i am lying on the street with bullets whizzing overhead 
and my son freaking out said trovato a graphic designer it 
started us wondering whether there isnt a better way to live

a bird thought to have become extinct in 
recent decades has been turning up on the dinner plates of farmers 
in vietnam the world wildlife fund for nature says 
three of the rare birds known as vietnamese or vo quys 
pheasants are currently in captivity in hanoi the vietnamese 
capital according to the latest issue of world wildlife fund news 
vietnamese scientists called a search for the bird after hunters 
in northcentral vietnam reported trapping and eating them 
regularly 
local farmers were asked to keep alive any pheasants caught 
bearing resemblance to the rare species 
the pheasant was first discovered in 1964 by vo quy a prominent 
ornithologist who has spearheaded conservation efforts in vietnam 
it was thought to have become extinct in the years that followed 
quy was quoted by world wildlife fund news as saying reserves 
covering the birds remaining area of forest habitat should be set 
up urgently to ensure its survival 
the three captive birds were seen at the hanoi zoo by elizabeth 
kemf author of the article and a recent book on environmental 
problems in vietnam 
quy also expressed concern for the fate of vietnams other 
species of pheasant eight of which are endangered 
hunting logging and clearing of land for agriculture were cited 
as responsible for the decline of all pheasant species in vietnam

japan has a parliament that rarely decides things 
a leader who rarely leads and an entrenched bureaucracy that is 
rarely challenged but its unique brand of democracy seems to work 
the diet as the parliament is known survived a powerless 
infancy and militaristdominated middle age to reach its 100th 
anniversary nov 29 but members and analysts say full maturity as 
a democratic forum remains elusive 
western notions of social equality and japanese notions of 
social hierarchy are still at war in asias oldest national 
legislature and at the heart of japans conservative democracy 
im among those who believe democracy in japan is still not 
quite mature said kazu aichi a leading legislator from the 
governing liberal democratic party it doesnt really appear that 
true debates take place within the diet theyre almost 
perfunctory ceremonial 
in part that is because liberal democrats have been in power 35 
years since the party was formed the leading permanent 
opposition parties which espouse a leftist ideology have failed 
to present a persuasive alternative to policies that helped build 
japans powerful economy 
to some degree the government resembles a ghost of the feudal 
past despite the vast changes in japan since world war ii 
powerful leaders of liberal democratic factions dispensing 
patronage in the manner of americas old political machines run 
the country in alliance with government bureaucrats and big 
business 
together the conservative oligarchs perpetuate the image of a 
faceless japan inc an industrial powerhouse built with the 
savings of compliant consumers 
japanese bureaucrats are an elite who attract graduates of the 
best universities the professions cachet dates from the samurai 
gentry who remade feudal japan into a westernized power in a single 
generation of the late 19th century 
bureaucrats write the government legislation which gives them 
enormous leverage on policy 
i would hesitate to call it true democracy if most decisions 
are not publicly made in the diet said shinichi kitaoka a 
political scientist at rikkyo university 
nor are most decisions made by the prime minister some analysts 
consider japans prime minister the least powerful leader of a 
major industrialized nations 
when i was working in the us in 198283 thenprime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone came to visit kitaoka said an american 
friend said to me your leader is now in washington i thought 
leader i could not get what he meant even as a political 
scientist 
japan is a consensual society aichi said it is just not 
the type of society in which the top leader makes decisions and 
everyone else follows so in that sense japan is a very democratic 
nation 
that has led some to question how japan despite its economic 
eminence can become a leader internationally the issue gained 
currency during months of hesitant government maneuvering with 
little result over sending military personnel to the persian gulf 
this is one of the major problems facing politicians in japan 
today said aichi who sees no prospect of reforming the system 
soon 
perhaps the strongest endorsement of japanese democracy is that 
it seems to work 
japanese sometimes say they have the largest middle class in the 
world 
in government surveys 90 percent of those responding describe 
themselves as middle class that is partly because of the nations 
affluence and partly because of reforms during the postwar us 
occupation that redistributed land and property 
the redistribution created a huge conservative constituency the 
new landowners and deprived the opposition socialist and communist 
parties of a natural underclass to represent 
many of todays ruling oligarchs rose from humble families 
through sheer ability 
the truth is that japan like the united states has woven the 
threads of democratic political life civil liberties open 
elections competitive politics and responsible government into 
the fabric of the nations social structure to create a stable 
political system that echoes universal values and behavior while at 
the same time being utterly unique gerald curtis an expert on 
japanese politics at columbia university wrote recently 
some commentators say the best proof that japan is becoming a 
true democracy is a new calm in public political debate 
some experts were impressed by the collective yawn with which 
many japanese treated recent constitutional debates of involvement 
in the persian gulf and aspects of emperor akihitos enthronement 
similar issues testing japans peace constitution aroused 
widespread violence and protests in the 1950s and 1960s when the 
specter of the militarism that plunged japan into the disastrous 
war was still vivid 
it didnt have the dimensions of a systemic crisis this 
time said j victor koschmann a cornell university expert in 
modern japanese history working in japan people didnt feel that 
institutions were being trampled on maybe the sense of threat has 
receded 
because of japans economic success he said all those traits 
that were once vilified abroad everyone now wants to imitate that 
kind of thing can give people a sense that we were ok all the 
time

we get to be astronomers it really is a great mission 
hoffman said in an interview earlier this year 
hoffman 46 flew on a 1985 mission during which he made an 
emergency spacewalk in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue a 
malfunctioning satellite 
while his main duty during the columbia flight is to help 
operate the astro observatory hoffman also is trained to perform a 
spacewalk if needed during the mission 
were not planning to do it but if it happens were ready 
he said 
hoffman already has plans to go into space again on a shuttle 
mission scheduled for september 1991 
he grew up in scarsdale ny he earned a bachelors in 
astronomy graduating with highest honors from amherst college 
hoffman earned a doctorate in astrophysics from harvard in 1971 
and a masters degree in materials science from rice university in 
1988 
before he was selected as an astronaut in 1978 hoffman worked

following a health evaluation 
nasa said durrance is medically qualified to take part in 
the mission but the space agency has declined to elaborate on the 
problem that almost kept him from flying 
durrance said he started working on the astro project in 1982 
and was finally picked to fly on a shuttle mission to operate the 
observatory two years later 
my feelings about the astro are great ive been working on it 
for a long time he said 
durrance grew up in tampa fla and earned a bachelor of

university he later earned a doctorate in astrogeophysics from the 
university of colorado 
but he hasnt always had his sights set on the stars 
durrance who built race cars when he was a teenager said he 
didnt really become interested in the space program until the 
apollo missions he decided to pursue a career in science although 
he didnt really aspire to become an astronaut 
at johns hopkins he is assistant project scientist for the

when margaret thatcher left 10 downing street last 
week she said she was proud to be leaving the country in much 
better shape than she found it in 1979 
but did she the debate goes on 
on the central crucial questions the state of the economy 
the competitiveness of britain in the world markets the level of 
inflation im afraid the record is not good said david 
marquand a professor of politics at the university of salford 
one of mrs thatchers boasts as prime minister was that her 
conservative government had increased the standard of living in 
britain 
per capita gross domestic product climbed from 5700 in 1979 to 
14860 a decade later while the national average gross weekly 
income rose to 589 from 234 
the number of people below half the national average income 
however doubled to 10 million during the decade 
its a mixed bag said jonathan leape who teaches economics 
at the london school of economics the growth in the last 10 
years has led to a bigger pie but to a much less welldistributed 
pie so that people at the low end have not benefitted as much as 
the people on the top end 
mrs thatcher presided over an eightyear economic boom the 
longest since world war ii british economic growth outstripped 
growth in germany and france after lagging during the previous two 
decades trade secretary peter lilley said in an interview on 
independent television 
we have managed to slough off the heritage of socialism and 
transform the economy said lilley a loyal thatcherite 
but the opposition labor partys spokesman on the economy john 
smith retorted that mrs thatcher created false growth through a 
credit boom 
now the economy is in a recession and is not expected to turn 
upward until the second half of 1991 
during her tenure mrs thatcher championed free market 
policies believing fervently in deregulation free enterprise and 
competition 
she sold 64 billion worth of stateowned companies and more 
than tripled the number of shareholders to 11 million or 24 
percent of the population 
mrs thatcher also slashed and simplified taxes britains top 
tax bracket got the biggest reduction from 83 percent to 40 
percent while the basic rate dropped from 33 percent to 25 
percent 
wanting to encourage home ownership she sold more than 15 
million governmentowned dwellings to their tenants 
but many new homeowners are struggling to pay adjustable rate 
mortgages they climbed along with britains base lending rate 
which stood at 15 percent for a year until it came down to 14 
percent in october 
mrs thatcher curbed britains militant trade unions with 
legislation that required unions to hold referendums before going 
on strike the number of days lost to strikes shrank to 41 million 
last year from 295 million in 1979 union membership has fallen to 
84 million from 12 million 
mrs thatcher also tried to wean britons off the welfare state 
but spending on social security programs has gone up 41 percent in 
real terms in the past decade 
she put a tight grip on public spending turning budget deficits 
into budget surpluses but britains infrastructure suffered and 
the number of homeless has increased critics say 
she oversaw the deregulation of the financial markets under the 
socalled big bang which allowed more players into the market 
abolished minimum commissions allowed banks to enter the 
securities business and permitted foreign firms to join the stock 
exchange 
but the stock market boom evaporated in the october 1987 stock 
market crash low trading volume has hurt profits and forced job 
cutbacks at many investment firms 
the critics also say big bang which brought higher salaries 
bonuses and stock options created a yuppie class reviled by 
many for its market speculation and flashy lifestyles while mrs 
thatcher sought to promote selfreliance and industriousness she 
instead fostered greed and selfishness they say 
britain enjoyed a fiveyear real estate boom but now lots of 
office space goes begging for tenants particularly in the 
docklands the huge east london development that was to exemplify 
the best of thatcherism 
among her other achievements mrs thatcher took inflation from 
18 percent down to 3 percent in 1986 but it has climbed back up to 
109 percent higher than the 103 percent rate that she inherited 
in 1979 
she got 17 percent interest rates as low as 75 percent but 
they too have bounced back up 
the current number of unemployed is 17 million people and 
climbing higher than 11 million in 1979 the figure went as high 
as 3 million during mrs thatchers tenure

cities are getting more ethnically diverse and 
their inhabitants are aging demands that cit governments must 
answer urban leaders said sunday 
were seeing a demographic wave that will transform entire 
regions said former san antonio mayor henry cisneros at the 67th 
annual convention of the national league of cities 
he moderated a panel of mayors city council members county 
commissioners and borough presidents who addressed the impact of 
these changes on electoral politics and the populace 
more white women and members of minorities are winning election 
to top spots in cities and counties at the same time the white 
urban population is growing older while minority populations are 
the youngest and fastest growing in the nation cisneros said 
in 10 years 92 percent of californians will live in a city with 
a population consisting of at least 30 percent asian hispanic or 
black residents he said 
similarly only 15 percent of those entering the job market in 
2000 will be white males 85 percent will be women and minorities 
these figures present dramatic implications about what we do 
for the planning of the future cities cisneros said 
panel members predicted difficulty in paying for bond issues for 
things as school improvements because the tax base in cities 
comprises older people on fixed incomes and the urban poor 
ruth messinger president of the new york city borough of 
manhattan said cities will need to address the need for day care 
and more education for families including bilingual instruction 
to keep residents working and paying taxes 
st petersburg fla mayor robert ulrich offered a different 
perspective he said the aging population should be regarded as an 
asset able to provide untapped resources in the form of public 
service 
one example was offered by mayor maynard jackson of atlanta 
where the city supports a program that brings together retired 
people with singleparent families to provide day care and 
employment at the same time 
michael woo a los angeles city councilman suggested better 
programming for english instruction 
i would like to see a common language said woo i believe 
in esl english as a second language but it would help if we did 
a better job if high schools were able to produce not only 
englishproficient minority students but also the blond and 
blueeyed variety 
cleveland mayor michael white said cities must offer fairness to 
their constituents and enfranchisement to minorities 
as long as this country commits 500 billion to bankrupt 
savings and loans as long as this country spends 4 billion to 6 
billion on iraq and kuwait as long as this country continues to 
lock in black kids brown kids and poor white kids into an economic 
system to which there is no end to the tunnel then it will 
continue to get worse white said

this restored colonial capital has long 
been a magnet for tourists lured by a city that once echoed with 
the speeches of the nations founding fathers lately however the 
visitor count has dropped 
tourism is down 10 percent for the year prompting the 
foundation that operates the 173acre attraction to offer hundreds 
of employees early retirement in hopes of saving about 1 million 
williamsburg became capital of englands virginia colony in 1699 
when nearby jamestown burned to the ground it was the colonial 
capital until 1776 and capital of virginia until 1779 
the city southeast of richmond was the scene of the convention 
of 1776 that instructed george washington and other virginia 
delegates to the continental congress the nations second oldest 
college william and mary was founded here in 1693 
nowadays guides wearing threecornered hats swords kneepants 
and stockings or bonnets and dresses with aprons answer 
questions about the 18th century there are demonstrations by 
silversmiths shoemakers and other craftsmen 
employees had mixed reactions to the early retirement offer by 
the colonial williamsburg foundation which owns four hotels and 11 
restaurants 
the plan was offered last month to employees who are at least 55 
years old and have at least 10 years with the foundation about 360 
employees are eligible 86 percent of the foundations work force 
of 4200 
foundation spokesman albert o louer said about 150 people were 
expected to retire early the deadline for acceptance is dec 19 
those who take the offer will get credit for five more years of 
employment continued health and life insurance and a pension 
supplement until they qualify for social security at age 62 
were taking it step by step so we can reach a comfortable 
level thats appropriate to make sure were financially sound 
louer said this program should be a major factor 
bill jones a waiter at christiana campbells tavern said he 
probably will reject the offer he has worked for the foundation 
for 37 years and will be 62 in two months 
at the moment its really not that much of an enticement for 
me jones said 
however baxter hardinge a store and post office manager and a 
nineyear employee said hes sorry he is ineligible 
in order for the company to grow it would be a good move 
he said 
tourism here was down even before there were signs of a national 
recession which only makes things worse said roy l pearson 
director of the college of william and marys bureau of business 
research 
he said 1990 has been the third worst year for williamsburg 
tourism exceeded only by the recession years of 1974 and 1982 
colonial williamsburg opened in 1932 after a sixyear 
restoration project paid for by john d rockefeller jr about 1 
million visitors are expected this year down from 117 million in 
1989 
daylong passes cost 21 to 2450 for adults and provide 
entrance to various exhibits and restored buildings there are also 
numerous restaurants and shops 
williamsburgs tourism growth ended prior to any slowdown 
nationally pearson wrote in his williamsburg business index 
if we were that vulnerable when others were doing well then we 
truly are at risk now that the external economy has stopped 
growing

colleges are shortchanging students and faculty 
alike by prizing professors research far more than their teaching 
or their social commitment a report says 
scholarship reconsidered priorities of the professoriate 
released sunday by the carnegie endowment for the advancement of 
teaching takes academia to task for shunning involvement in 
solving problems outside the ivory tower 
what we urgently need today is a more inclusive view of what 
it means to be a scholar a recognition that knowledge is acquired 
through research through synthesis through practice and through 
teaching said the study by foundation president ernest l boyer 
the report called on college officials to base tenure decisions 
on teaching skills and community involvement as well as scholarly 
publications and it urged campuses to include the views of past 
and present students in evaluating professors for tenure or 
promotions 
in the current climate students all too often are the 
losers said the report 
in glossy brochures theyre assured that teaching is 
important that a spirit of community pervades the campus and that 
general education is the core of the undergraduate experience 
but the reality is that on far too many campuses teaching is 
not well rewarded and faculty who spend too much time counseling 
and advising students may diminish their prospects for tenure and 
promotion 
good teaching is assumed not rewarded said a math 
professor quoted anonymously in the report the administrators 
and many faculty dont regard extra time spent with students as 
time well spent this is the most frustrating aspect of my work 
a 1989 carnegie survey of 5450 college faculty found 62 percent 
agreed that teaching effectiveness not publication should be the 
primary criterion for promotion 
colleges too rarely reward professors for devoting their time 
and ideas to topics like school reform banking or health care the 
report said 
it cited comments by harvard president derek bok pointing out 
that it was nonacademicians such as rachel carson ralph nader and 
betty friedan who blazed the trails for the environmental consumer 
and feminist movements 
ernst benjamin general secretary of the american association of 
university professors praised the report saying it accurately 
describes the dependence of collegiate instruction on scholarship 
in a manner which appreciates the strengths of american higher 
education and shows how to use these strengths to improve it 
in an interview boyer expressed optimism that the stiffening 
competition for collegeage students will lead educators to heed 
the reports message 
students want their moneys worth he said the pressures 
on undergraduate institutions will increase because as the pricing 
goes up there are growing questions about what you get for your 
investment

a street hit from the pages of the godfather 
allegedly transformed john gotti into the nations most powerful 
crime boss but five years later gotti faces the mobsters fatal 
equation power plus prestige equals prosecution 
right now he is the no 1 target of law enforcement its 
just a matter of time hes going to go said jules bonalovonta 
head of the fbis organized crime office in new york 
bonalovonta has history on his side from al capone to joe 
bonanno godfathers have turned grandfathers while behind bars 
the heads of four of the citys five organized crime families 
were convicted and sentenced to 100 years in prison each in 1986 
the fifth paul castellano never heard those verdicts he was 
gunned down months earlier in gottis alleged grandstand play for 
control of the gambino family 
but claiming gotti killed castellano is one thing proving it is 
another he has never been charged in the killing although a 
muchrumored racketeering indictment including the hit is 
reportedly due this month 
three times gotti has appeared in new york city courts on other 
charges and three times he has walked outaa free man earning the 
nickname the teflon don the acquittals combined with his 
reputation for violence and fine clothing have given gotti 
national notoriety 
yet that image may bring his downfall experts say castellanos 
approach described by one as much more sophisticated 
racketeering than gottis and therefore harder to detect and 
prosecute is more conducive to a lengthy stay at the head of an 
organized crime family they believe 
unless of course somebody inside the organization decides to 
kill you nine days before christmas 
paul castellano was a class act he was the emerging racketeer 
of the 90s theres a great variance between mr gotti and mr 
castellano said fred martens director of the pennsylvania crime 
commission 
one was a businessman racketeer the other is a plain 
oldfashioned gangster right out of the 20s thats the 
difference 
castellanos style which included the creation of citywide 
concrete scam that netted millions and an aversion to drug 
trafficking was in marked contrast to the gambinos under gotti 
investigators say 
castellano seemed shrewder he kept a low profile and he also 
bridged the legitimate and illegitimate worlds which gave him a 
little more freedom said michael chertoff acting us attorney 
in newark 
chertoff was prosecuting castellano and the heads of the four 
other mob families when the reputed gambino boss and bodyguard 
thomas bilotti were gunned down dec 16 1985 outside a midtown 
manhattan steakhouse 
gottis attorney bruce cutler noted his client is often linked 
to the slaying but asserted gottis innocence 
take this poor mr castellano who was killed how many times 
have the newspapers said my client had something to do with this 
he didnt said cutler 
chertoff believes big paul in some ways wielded more power 
than gotti 
gotti seems powerful but that may be because the other bosses 
are gone said chertoff gotti is high profile he has an aura 
but thats media stuff that doesnt translate into real power 
real power is cash and soldiers gotti has plenty of both he 
has increased the number of made or initiated family 
members since taking over said bonalovonta most of the new 
members deal drugs he said 
the gambino forces now number about 500 made members he 
estimated 
the gambinos other sources of income remain the same gambling 
extortion loansharking union control airport ripoffs and 
dominance of the garment district 
although the gambino family is the strongest financially 
gottis reign has seen its share of problems 
thomas gambino son of late family boss carlo has been indicted 
for allegedly controlling the garment district through extortion 
and coercion gene gotti johns brother is doing a 50year 
stretch for heroin trafficking and frank de cicco a trusted gotti 
underboss was killed by a car bomb 
the same fate could await the man his friends call johnny boy 
gotti has twice been targeted for hits once in a bungled attempt 
outside the bosss queens hangout the bergin hunt and fish club 
and once by the genovese family in a dispute 
the gunman responsible for the first attempt was later found on 
staten island with five bullets in his head the second bid was 
undercut when fbi agents got wind of the plans and warned gotti 
the brutal retaliation for the first attempt added to gottis 
reputation as did his three acquittals on an assault case a 
racketeering trial and the shooting of a union official

overseas sales of us cigarettes have risen 
dramatically the last five years more than offsetting a decline in 
domestic use by healthconscious americans an agriculture 
department report says 
cigarette output dropped 20 percent from 1981 to 1985 this 
year the report said production may be up 3 percent from the 1985 
level domestic use has dropped 12 percent since 1985 the report 
said 
the continued decline in us cigarette consumption is due to 
rising prices and taxes slipping social acceptance health 
concerns and restrictions on where people can smoke the report 
said 
further analysts expect the decline in domestic cigarette use 
to continue in the 1990s perhaps by 3 percent or more each year 
the report by verner n grise of the departments economic 
research service is in the december issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine published by the agency 
in 1985 sales abroad totaled 59 billion cigarettes that is 
down 29 percent from the peak of 83 billion pieces set in 1981 
in 1990 the us is probably exporting 160 billion 
cigarettes almost three times the 1985 mark the report said 
the phenomenal growth partly reflects lowered trade barriers in 
japan taiwan and south korea 
other factors have been the high quality of us cigarettes 
rising incomes in importing countries and the weakening of the 
dollar against foreign currencies 
recent moves in eastern europe and the soviet union toward 
marketoriented systems also have spurred increased interest in 
us cigarettes 
the soviet union has agreed with us manufacturers to buy more 
than 35 billion cigarettes over the next two years with further 
sales expected the soviets will swap goods for part of the 
cigarettes but the report said some analysts are concerned that 
moscow will have trouble finding hard currency to pay for the rest 
another indication of the growing foreign markets is a decision 
by some us companies to set up manufacturing plants in what was 
east germany a strong sign of the regions hunger for american 
cigarettes the report said 
still another example is thailands agreement to abide by a 
recent ruling by the general agreement on tariffs and trade against 
thailands 10year ban on cigarette imports 
efforts to open the thai market were hampered by an unusual 
alliance between us antismoking groups and the thai tobacco 
industry the report said 
at home us cigarettes are finding a tough market outlook the 
report cited a gallup poll survey in july that indicated a growing 
antismoking sentiment among americans 
smoking restrictions have increased markedly and smoking is 
now banned on all continental us airline flights and all flights 
to and from alaska and hawaii that last less than six hours the 
report said 
despite the tighter restrictions and declines in tobacco use 
americans will spend a record 44 billion on tobacco products this 
year the report said about 95 percent of that will be for 
cigarettes 
 
washington ap gross farm receipts from crop sales in 1991 
could exceed 80 billion up by as much as 5 billion from this 
years forecast according to agriculture department economists 
pushed by low stocks and pulled by a strong livestock sector 
feed grain sales could increase as much as 3 billion an outlook 
conference report said last week corn receipts are likely to be 
up 10 percent while soybean receipts are expected to rise above 
11 billion 
corn production in 1991 is expected to increase if the 
governments acreage reduction requirements are trimmed from this 
years 10 percent level the report said 
some producers may opt not to participate in the government 
program in 1991 expanding their planted acreage and increasing 
their future base it said 
soybean prices are anticipated to be stable but could be 
dampened by large plantings on triple base acres a feature of 
the 1990 farm law that gives farmers more choice on using land 
direct payments to farmers in 1991 under the new law are 
expected to drop 10 percent to 15 percent from this year 
 
washington ap turkey production almost doubled during the 
1980s and is headed for another gain next year according to 
agriculture department projections 
total 1991 output is forecast at around 48 billion pounds that 
represents an increase of 5 percent to 7 percent from this year 
the 1990 increase was 9 percent 
average wholesale prices in 1991 are expected to remain nearly 
the same as in 1990 with slight increases likely early in the 
year an outlook report said last week continued high prices 
for red meats will help turkey prices as will the support to the 
market provided by the continued growth in purchases of processed 
turkey meats 
per capita consumption of turkey is expected to rise to more 
than 19 pounds next year up one pound from the 1990 average

church bells peal and a man with a 
megaphone mimics a crowing rooster as the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide rides into town on horseback to be greeted by thousands of 
adoring supporters 
the fiery leftist priest revered by the masses as a prophet is 
taking his remarkable quest for the presidency across haiti in a 
campaign imbued with messianic symbolism and patriotic fervor 
he calls the campaign operation lavales or torrent a 
biblical flood to cleanse haiti of corruption and tyranny its 
emblem is the fighting cock representing haitis coming sunrise 
with aristide lord there will be no dishonesty the people 
chant as the slight bespectacled cleric nicknamed titid 
appears in their midst 
aristide 37 has survived at least three assassination attempts 
and was expelled from his roman catholic order in 1988 for 
preaching revolution he is widely regarded as the frontrunner 
among 11 candidates in the dec 16 election 
supporters say the charismatic priest offers the best hope of 
giving the impoverished caribbean nation not only the first 
democratically elected president in its turbulent 186year history 
but the stability of a government with huge popular support 
critics accuse aristide of demagoguery and say his a presidency 
based on emotional mass appeal would pose the threat of a 
theocratic dictatorship 
that appeal has been evident on campaign stops across the 
country from the slums of portauprince the capital to the 
northern city of caphaitien where an estimated 60000 people took 
part in what was probably the biggest demonstration in the citys 
history 
in jacmel a crumbling port on the southern coast perhaps 5000 
people including hundreds of students in brown and blue school 
uniforms poured into the town square for a recent aristide rally 
dismounting a horse he rode from the outskirts of the city 
aristide plunged into one of his trademark questionresponse 
orations in which the distinctions between national pride and 
christian love are blurred 
aristide young people you know what it is to be lovesick 
crowd yes 
aristide are you in love with haiti 
crowd yes 
all sing the lilting haiti cherie or darling haiti 
which is to haitians what america the beautiful is to 
americans 
then aristide we are going to do away with injustice 
totally 
together totally totally totally totally totally 
totally 
aristide unexpectedly entered the presidential race in 
midoctober after roger lafontant reputed former head of the 
duvalier dictatorships infamous tonton macoute militia declared 
his candidacy 
lafontant was later disqualified on a technicality 
although no opinion polls have been published the consensus 
among political observers is that aristide commands much wider 
support than any of haitis veteran politicians 
aristide is the figurehead of a messianic movement the 
incarnation of a collective dream says laennec hurbon a 
specialist on religious movements in the caribbean his 
responsibility to his following is not the same as that of a 
politician to his constituency 
aristide gained a nationwide following largely from radio 
broadcasts of his electrifying sermons in which he railed against 
successive military regimes that have ruled haiti since the 
february 1986 when jeanclaude baby doc duvalier was driven 
into exile 
he is an adherent of liberation theology which promotes 
political and social awareness among the poor 
in september 1988 thugs armed with guns machetes and spikes 
burst into aristides st jean bosco church during mass killing at 
least 12 parishioners and wounding 70 three months later 
aristide was expelled from the conservative salesian order for 
refusing to tone down his rhetoric 
the only other presidential candidate whose appeal approaches 
aristides is the moderate louis dejoie jr who drew thousands of 
supporters on a recent campaign swing of the southern peninsula 
marc bazin a former world bank official frequently mentioned as 
a favorite of the us embassy which denies any preference is 
also seen as running strongly 
bazins national alliance for democracy andpprogress the 
countrys bestfunded political machine is expected to dominate 
parliament after the election if bazin fails to win the 
presidency he could still become prime minister since the 
president must chose a prime minister from among the majority 
party 
under haitis constitution the president is head of state but 
the prime minister runs the government aristide has said he would 
embrace the next prime minister but many haitians see the 
potential for conflict 
voter registration has reached 33 million or 92 percent of the 
electorate according to election officials a phenomenon largely 
attributed to aristides candidacy

computer purchasing officials in the navy and 
possibly in other government agencies have too cozy a relationship 
with privatesector contractors such as ibm corp says a 
congressional report issued today 
the house government operations committee report says there 
should be stronger regulations and better oversight to eliminate 
bias in awarding computer contracts 
the report follows a yearlong probe touched off by complaints 
in 1988 from six ibm competitors who said they had been frozen out 
of the navys multibilliondollar computer market 
through a combination of agency malfeasance and the dominance 
of one vendor the fair and open system contemplated by congress 
has been torpedoed in navy computer procurement the report 
says 
it details a tangled web of agency and contractor abuse 
improprieties and illegalities said rep john conyers dmich 
the committee chairman its an old story that when the rule of 
law breaks down it is the strong who benefit 
the committee said its investigation had been broadened to 
include other agencies including the national institutes of 
health the national aeronautics and space administration and the 
treasury department all have large complex computer systems and 
are major computer equipment buyers 
the report says ibm appears for the most part not to be 
responsible for the bizarre navy acquisition system but merely 
its willing beneficiary 
former naval officer john cahill testified during one hearing 
that his commanding officer while attending a free ibm promotional 
training seminar telephoned cahill and ordered him to change our 
procurement strategy to go after a new ibm technology the report 
said cahill said he refused and awarded the contract to another 
company 
the report described the officers participation in the ibm 
program as clearly improper at least 128 navy officials were 
trained by ibm in san jose calif between 1985 and 1987 
navy undersecretary j daniel howard in a sept 7 letter to 
conyers said ibms training of cahills superior was not an 
illegal gratuity because ibm did not win the contract it sought 
but howard acknowledged there was an appearance of impropriety 
the general services administration the agency responsible for 
overseeing government purchases of automated data processing 
equipment should take the lead in fixing the system to eliminate 
bias the report said 
it said the gsa should review training programs and seminars 
offered by computer contractors to determine whether they are 
proper for government employees and should issue clear guidelines 
on contacts between federal buyers and contractors 
gsa should review government computer purchases more frequently 
and carefully the report said agencies cannot be trusted to 
follow the rules and regulations governing computer 
acquisitions it said 
navy spokesman lt james wood would not comment beyond saying 
that the navy had cooperated with the committee during the 
investigation 
ibm spokesman mark holcomb said the company endorsed the 
proposed review of policies on relations between the government and 
privatesector computer companies 
but he said it would be unfair if congress in ordering such a 
review implied that ibms dealings with the navy had been 
improper 
we did not do anything wrong holcomb said if they want 
to change the regulations after the fact we will comply but were 
in complete compliance with existing regulations and have been 
all along

the teenagers listened spellbound as rachelle 
horowitz recalled the sweltering day when martin luther king jr 
stood just a few feet away down the steps of the lincoln memorial 
for these budding historians children of the medecade 80s 
the civil rights movement had been an abstraction in a textbook 
but the 17 students from high schools in 15 states and the 
district of columbia walked away from the memorial with a sense of 
awe that they can convey to the millions of tourists who climb the 
same steps each year 
its more exciting here than learning it in school said 
barbara burnette a 19yearold senior at edison high school in 
minneapolis 
with books youre like right oh yeah youve got to be 
there to really get into it 
the students were selected to help the national park service 
plan and raise money for a new museum inside the lincoln memorial 
to honor the legacy of lincoln king and the nations other leaders 
in civil rights 
i used to think lincoln was just a great man who was tall and 
wore a hat said maureen may 17 of copley ohio but now i 
want his ideals to come alive i want everyone to know about his 
legacy and to use it 
the students spent the past week in the washington area talking 
to park service planners touring historic sites and listening to 
people like horowitz who participated in the 1963 march on 
washington and other major demonstrations 
horowitz then 23 was the transportation director for the march 
on washington 
she pointed around the corner inside the memorial where us 
rep john lewis dga a black student protest leader at the time 
hurriedly rewrote one of the opening speeches she pointed down the 
steps to the very spot where king stood and told the world i 
have a dream 
he silenced a quarter of a million people on a hot august 
day she told the students 
horowitz provided the students with the sights sounds and the 
sense of the throng spread out before king 
the national park service has involved the students in planning 
the lincoln memorial museum in a way that it has never used the 
public before said jane radford a park service planner 
this is not done in the museum business she said this 
was particularly appropriate and very exciting because lincolns 
legacy is often carried on by the youth of this country in protest 
and demonstration 
the proposed museum capped a twoyear effort begun by a 
scottsdale ariz high school history class the students were 
upset that their state wouldnt honor king with a holiday 
the students were picked by the american federation of teachers 
and other organizations to represent a crosssection of ethnic 
backgrounds their selection was based on a demonstrated interest 
in lincoln and good communication and leadership skills 
later they will coordinate a student drive to raise 300000 for 
the exhibit by collecting pennies 
the students visited the park services interpretative design 
center in harpers ferry wva where they submitted their proposal 
for an exhibit featuring interactive videos continuous films 
computer quizzes artifacts and recordings 
the students came from high schools in alabama arizona 
colorado connecticut the district of columbia florida 
massachusetts minnesota missouri nevada new mexico new york 
ohio pennsylvania utah and washington

the recording sessions were held in quonset 
huts on movie sets in night clubs after hours some of the 
biggest names in show business from oldtimers like al jolson to 
newcomers like frank sinatra performed 
but the records produced in a sixyear period during and after 
world war ii were heard only by american servicemen overseas now 
through the efforts of a retired navy officer who helped oversee 
their production they are on the us market 
nearly 920 12inch 78rpm records were produced by the army and 
navy from 1943 through 1949 as morale boosters they were called 
vdiscs the records 8 million copies altogether were 
accompanied by 125000 springoperated windup phonographs each 
with 100 steel needles 
they were played on ships in foxholes in trenches on 
airplanes in hospitals said edmond p digiannantonio digi as 
he is known ran the navys part of the program and keeps a 
wellpreserved copy of each record in a closet in his lakeside home 
here 
one serviceman wrote a letter saying he and his buddies were 
playing a vdisc as they headed to the dday invasion of normandy 
digiannantonio said 
the program was started after an army musical branch captain 
named bob vincent suggested to army officials in washington that 
they get popular band leaders like benny goodman and artie shaw to 
record for the troops 
the colonel vincents superior said look these guys dont 
want to hear any swing music or any jazz they want marching 
music digiannantonio recalled 
the colonels reluctance was overcome and we went on to 
include all types of music in all releases said digiannantonio 
from toscanini to spike jones all the way 
when the navy started looking for an officer to run the navy 
marine corps and coast guard part of the program digiannantonio 
was in a hospital in boston recovering from wounds he suffered 
when his ship the heavy cruiser vincennes was sunk off 
guadalcanal 
he had played violin piano and saxophone in high school in 
boston and at massachusetts institute of technology held a 
broadcast engineers license and had recorded shaw glenn miller 
goodman and other band leaders when they came to town 
so he got the job 
along with each box of 20 or 30 records went copies of a 
questionnaire asking the servicemen to say what kind of music they 
wanted white christmas was the most requested piece about 60 
percent wanted jazz or swing 20 percent or so classical and some 
country and western or others marches didnt make it 
some of the music came from movie film tracks and transcriptions 
of radio broadcasts but many were live recordings by artists 
donating their services 
during the early years they were the only records made the 
american federation of musicians at odds with the recording 
companies over royalties had banned all recording until the 
dispute was settled union president james caesar petrillo waived 
the ban to permit the recordings for the troops 
we recorded in night clubs hotel ballrooms movie studios 
quonset huts army bases navy bases wherever the artists were 
said digiannantonio now 73 
in those days when you went on a job you traveled by bus all 
night theyd do a session and wind up at one or two in the 
morning and then come to a studio and lug all the instruments and 
record for us 
the services had tried sending shellac records overseas earlier 
but found that most of them were broken before they arrived the 
vdiscs were recorded on more durable vinylite when vinylite 
became scarce because it was critically needed for insulation they 
switched to formvar a product developed in canada 
instructions on changing needles were often ignored so many of 
the records wore out overseas others were left behind when the war 
ended digiannantonio said that when the vdisc program ended 
officials ordered the remaining disks destroyed to prevent 
commercial use 
nevertheless the library of congress has a nearly complete set 
their quality ranges from very good to poor depending on the 
source said music librarian sam brylawski 
remember how heavy those old needles were said brylawski 
that would gouge a record like a vdisc if we got one from 
someone who really liked their recording a lot it could very well 
be beat up 
digiannantonio took good care of his 
they have been transferred to cassettes and compact discs with 
no adjustment of the original sound 
some people said lets enhance it and do this or this said 
digiannantonio but we said this is the way it was and we are 
going to do it that way 
digiannantonio said he has clearance from the defense department 
to market the recordings and is working with the american 
federation of musicians and broadcast music inc about payment of 
royalties 
he said much of the profit will go to the musicians union 
retirement fund or to the artists their families or their 
estates 
the first installment is a threecassette set with 37 numbers 
including glenn miller playing chattanooga choo choo jolson 
singing mammy and connie boswell crooning good night 
sweetheart 
 
editors note the first vdisk installment is available for 
2495 in cassette or 2995 in compact disc from vdisc po box

seventeen years after the governments 
authority for a military draft expired the selective service 
system is alive and well and on standby 
but if president bush and congress gave the order the selective 
service could start issuing draft notices within days and supply up 
to 100000 young men within a month 
bush has said as recently as last week that he doesnt want to 
see the draft reactivated but its the job of the selective 
service to be ready just in case 
the agency has 270 fulltime employees 2000 local draft boards 
and a entire system for resuming the draft if ordered to do so 
its business as usual because that is our mission to be 
ready selective service spokeswoman barbi richardson said we 
were ready a year ago and wed be ready tomorrow 
however selective service director samuel k lessey jr said 
our agency has had no indication that a draft is needed in 
response to the middle east crisis 
still the buildup of us troops in the persian gulf has led to 
growing public concern and debate about the draft which was one of 
the most divisive issues of the vietnam war 
former navy secretary james webb last week questioned bushs 
buildup of the troops in the gulf but said if the president is 
serious about going on the offensive he should call for an 
immediate resumption of the draft to avoid troop shortages 
the presidents authority to draft men into the armed forces 
which had been routinely renewed by congress every four years 
expired on july 1 1973 three months after the last us soldiers 
left vietnam the military then began depending only on voluntary 
enlistments 
even if the draft were reinstated quickly there would be a 
significant time lag before conscripts reached the gulf by law 
draftees may not be sent oversees for three months after induction 
lawrence korb a brookings institution analyst who was assistant 
secretary of defense for manpower until 1985 said it would take a 
year to get conscripts trained and over to the gulf 
i dont think it the draft is likely korb said 
militarily it doesnt make sense 
martin binkin another brookings institution analyst said i 
do not think that the average american kid has to worry about 
conscription 
many are worried nonetheless 
we receive calls from mothers from the young men their 
wives their girlfriends their grandmothers their grandfathers 
the selective services ms richardson said we let them know 
there is no draft and we do not anticipate one 
david treber of the national interreligious service board for 
conscientious objectors said his organization also is getting more 
calls 
weve even had mothers who have 14yearold sons wanting to 
get information treber said other calls come from college 
students who say i registered for the draft a couple years ago 
and never thought it would amount to anything and now im 
worried treber said 
james blackwell of the center for strategic and international 
studies said the need for a draft may increase as voluntary 
enlistments drop off due to concern about a possible war in the 
persian gulf 
the longer it lasts and the closer it comes to a shooting 
conflict the closer we come to a draft he said 
the selective service insists it is doing nothing unusual in 
response to the troop buildup in the gulf 
should congress authorize a return to the draft the selective 
service within hours or days could hold a lottery based on dates 
of birth to determine the order in which men would be inducted 
ms richardson said 
top priority for the draft would be young men who turned 20 
during the same calendar year as the lottery young men already are 
required to register with selective service when they turn 18 
once draft notices were issued draftees would have 10 days to 
report to a military processing station for examination and 
perhaps immediate induction 
only after a young man got a draft notice could he file a 
request to postpone or avoid military service reasons for a delay 
might include an emergency such as serious illness or a death in 
the family 
others might request classification as conscientious objectors 
who oppose participation in war they would be required to serve 
either in a noncombat position or in a civilian job that benefited 
the nation 
under one change that took effect near the end of the vietnam 
war young men no longer can defer military service for years 
because they are in college deferments now last only until the end 
of the current semester 
requests to delay or avoid military service are considered by 
local draft boards made up of trained volunteers the fivemember 
boards meet yearly to consider sample cases draft or no draft

blacks and jews who marched shoulder to 
shoulder during the civil rights movement of the 1960s have often 
feuded since but leaders of both groups are hoping an institute 
founded here will help heal the rift 
there is a need for a coalition of blacks and jews said 
dillard university president dr samuel dubois cook the man behind 
the national center for blackjewish relations 
we can do so many things together fighting poverty working 
for social justice getting blacks into the mainstream improving 
education and fighting common enemies 
more than 200 people were invited to the center for a twoday 
conference titled healing the broken community which ended 
wednesday 
this center is not only important its a model for the future 
of our society said rabbi robert j marx of congregation hakafa 
in glencoe ill cochairman of the blackjewish dialogue in 
chicago and a speaker at the conference 
dillard a predominantly black nonsectarian liberal arts and 
sciences college gave 100000 to the center when it was founded 
this year and plans to raise up to 10 million for it 
the program has been needed for a long time said ai botnick 
executive director of the south central region of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
i went through the period of close coalition and common goals 
the two communities shared in the 1960s botnick said when 
that fell apart nothing was done to heal it while some 
individuals made attempts to find solutions what were to be major 
remedies became bandaids this institute is the first effort of 
its kind and it has great prospects for the entire nation 
while blacks and jews during the 1960s were united in their 
support for integration and voting rights economic and ethnic 
issues helped divide them over the next 20 years 
for instance former new york city mayor edward koch was an 
active supporter of the civil rights movement but later angered 
blacks with his stiff opposition to hiring quotas and accusations 
of antisemitism in 1984 relations became especially tense after 
a washington post reporter revealed the rev jesse jackson had 
referred to jews as hymie and new york city as hymietown 
a conference in april 1989 examined the root causes of the 
nearcollapse of the alliance and revealed a widespread desire for 
reconciliation cook said 
its criminal cook said if there are any natural allies 
in history it should be blacks and jews for them not to be wrings 
my heart during the 1960s the two groups played key roles in the 
civil rights movement we have been separated by a number of things 
including some people in both groups who have said things that have 
hurt us 
most of last weeks sessions were closed so that participants 
could discuss issues frankly cook said workshops were set up on 
economics education and the role of the media and others in 
pitting blacks and jews against each other cook said 
one man who may help unify the two groups is david duke the 
republican state representative and former ku klux klan leader who 
ran for the us senate 
there are people and groups in this country who would like to 
see the jews and blacks wiped out in addition to the positive 
things that can flow from this conference we can work together 
against our common enemies like david duke cook said

helmut kohls reelection campaign 
showed the german chancellor in a new selfassured style more 
elegantly dressed relaxed a better speaker 
and the crowds were bigger too giving kohl more enthusiastic 
receptions than ever in his eight years as chancellor 
having delivered the unification of east and west germany in 
record time kohl had been heavily favored all along to win a third 
fouryear term 
but in the last four weeks of the campaign the 60yearold kohl 
still made 28 campaign appearances doing what he likes the best 
working the crowds and winning elections 
one of the last was in southern germany in offenburg pushing 
his wheelchairbound interior minister wolfgang schaeuble onto 
the podium 
schaeuble barely survived an assassination attempt in october 
and the gesture was vintage kohl a move that would strike the 
hearts of ordinary germans 
but it was not only electioneering kohl was deeply moved by 
schaeubles ordeal and had tears in his eyes when he had visited 
the bedside of his trusted minister and possible successor 
in chemnitz in former east germany before speaking at a 
campaign rally kohl stopped at a local inn to have coffee and 
banter with the owners 
these are the times he says he likes the best mingling with 
ordinary people when he feels like a farmer at the plough you 
can smell the earth 
according to nearly complete official returns kohls 
centerright governing coalition won 548 percent of the vote 
sunday to 335 percent for the main opposition social democrats 
led by oskar lafontaine 
kohl became chancellor in october 1982 when a switch of 
coalition alliances enabled him to form a government at the head of 
his christian democratic union he was confirmed in national 
elections in 1983 and 1987 
at first he was regarded as a blunderprone provincial 
politician who spoke with a distinct local accent but kohl has 
risen to the status of a respected international statesman leader 
of a country that will play a political role finally equal to its 
economic might 
in many fields of politics we are in a leading position in 
europe and in the world kohl said recently 
often said in the past to be slow in making decisions kohl 
seized the historic opportunity presented with the collapse of east 
germanys communist government and the fall of the berlin wall a 
year ago 
i like to be underestimated ive managed very well for 30 
years by being underestimated kohl likes to say 
his whirlwind relentless drive to achieve quick unification 
paid off when germany became one fully sovereign state on oct 3 
with kohl as chancellor 
his new image is reflected by trendier doublebreasted suits 
and the virtual disappearance of kohl jokes 
cartoons used to depict kohl floating in outer space while aides 
grappled with problems or flipping coins to make decisions now 
the 6foot5 chancellor is more likely to be depicted as a smiling 
figure towering over the german landscape as the newsweekly der 
speigel showed him in a preelection cover story on the lucky 
giant 
kohl was born on april 3 1930 in ludwigshafen a southwest 
german industrial city in a winegrowing region of the rhine river 
his father was a minor revenue official and his mother a teacher 
he earned a doctorate in political science from heidelberg 
university in 1958 and devoted his entire adult life to politics 
he joined the christian democratic union in 1947 at the age of 17 
kohl served in various rhinelandpalatinate state party posts 
he was elected governor in 1969 and took over as his partys 
national chairman in 1973 
the chancellor has been staunchly proamerican and went ahead 
with the deployment of us nuclear missiles in the 1980s despite 
widespread popular opposition 
he survived several scandals that shook bonn such as an 
espionage affair in 1985 and a political payoffs scandal and some 
notorious gaffes 
kohl once compared soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
public relations skills to those of nazi propaganda minister joseph 
goebbels now he is said to be on firstname terms with gorbachev 
whom he constantly praises as the man who made unification 
possible 
the chancellor and his wife hannelore have two sons walter 
and peter he is a staunch roman catholic who often stresses family 
values 
kohl is said to feel uncomfortable abroad but goes to austria 
for his annual slimming cure he is not fluent in any foreign 
language but has been heard using some english 
kohl has said this may not be his last election and that his 
goal remains the complete unification of europe by the year 2000

here are excerpts from a french television 
interview with iraqi president saddam hussein recorded saturday 
and broadcast sunday saddam spoke in arabic and the french 
transcript was translated into english by the associated press 
q do you accept the dialogue proposed to you by president bush 
a if president bush wishes to establish a balanced dialogue 
such a dialogue must not get under way on the basis of 
preconditions president bush has proposed two meetings we 
have accepted 
q what gesture are you ready to make to convince the world of 
your good will as you begin this dialogue 
a there is no proposition more important than a dialogue that 
reaches a solution to all the problems of the region and at their 
head the palestinian problem we have taken a series of 
initiatives regarding the hostages and we have even fixed a date 
march 25 as the last date for all of them to go home if nothing 
happens to disturb the peace 
this is not a tactic to sow discord in the ranks of whomever 
but it is one of the means which we think is capable of preventing 
war such a method has perhaps proven its effectiveness because so 
far there has been no war 
we will free them the hostages as soon we have the 
assurance that president bush will not attack the iraqi people 
between now and march 25 if after march 25 he still has the 
devil in his head we will rely on god in order to face any 
eventuality 
q now that president bush has proposed dialogue and you can 
save face to an extent why not open up some possibility regarding 
kuwait 
a our face is saved we dont need bush for that our face is 
saved because we are believers you know that bush has not 
taken the same measures visavis the israeli occupation of 
palestine and doesnt even lift his little finger when he sees on 
the television screens women children and old people being killed 
humiliated and tortured in palestine by the israelis 
the problem is that president bush and the other western heads 
of state have two united nations charters a criteria based on 
evaluations of their own needs and interests and a criteria for the 
oppressed peoples of the third world oppressed by the policies of 
the western bloc and by the united states in particular 
q is it necessary for a country like iraq to provide itself 
with a nuclear capability the americans say this will happen in a 
year or two 
a i speak of the present if we had nuclear weapons we 
wouldnt have any problem saying so but we dont possess a 
nuclear weapon why doesnt the west protest and worry at the 
destructive capabilities of israel 
q and this evening are we closer to war or to peace 
a fiftyfifty if they want to make this meeting a real path 
toward dialogue then we are closer to peace but if they want to 
make this meeting nothing other than a formal exhibition for 
congress or international public opinion simply to give themselves 
good conscience to say there weve tried dialogue with iraq 
without iraq renouncing its positions in that case were closer 
to war

chancellor helmut kohls victory in allgerman 
elections gives him both the mandate to guide germany to a stronger 
role in world affairs and the burden of assimilating his nations 
troubled eastern lands 
one of his first priorities he indicated during the campaign 
will be to have parliament consider changing the constitution to 
permit sending troops to the persian gulf 
at home kohl must focus on building up the former east germany 
and raising the living standards of its inhabitants a process that 
will cost hundreds of billions of dollars 
after leading his christian democratled coalition to victory on 
sunday kohl predicted it will take jst three to four years to 
develop the industrially backward eastern lands into a thriving 
region 
we will achieve that he told a television interviewer 
expanded influence in eastern europe and greater aid to the 
soviets also top the issues list for kohl and the new 656member 
parliament that links lawmakers from the eastern and western parts 
of the country 
an expanded international agenda and kohls confidence with it 
signal another departure from the past previously west germany 
hid cozily behind its nato allies following their lead on 
international events 
even before kohl led his country to unification with east 
germany two months ago demands were growing for a united germany 
to take on greater international responsibilities 
in september secretary of state james a baker iii told kohl 
that being more means doing more and there were suggestions of 
giving germany a permanent seat in the un security council 
the germans politely turned down that suggestion but the 
international agenda is full as the 60yearold kohl heads into his 
third fouryear term 
kohl several times during the election campaign backed a 
constitutional change that would allow german troops take part in 
such missions the usled multinational force arrayed against 
iraq 
he promised the new parliament will consider the change soon 
such a constitutional amendment would be momentous in a country 
still saddled by the murderous legacy of the nazi past kohl says 
the current constitution forbids german military missions outside 
nato areas 
the united germany is faced with a growing responsibility in 
the community of nations including the preservation of world 
peace kohl said in a speech on oct 3 unification day 
germany already has promised to provide more than 2 billion 
ollars in support for the campaign to drive the iraqis from kuwait 
although many in the us congress say that is far too little 
breaking ranks somewhat with other western leaders kohl last 
month proposed solving the arabisraeli conflicts and the lebanese 
civil war along with the persian gulf stalemate 
in the closing days of the election campaign he suggested 
regional security organizations to keep the peace in the middle 
east 
meanwhile germanys influence is likely to grow throughout 
eastern europe as the new democracies there seek help in rebuilding 
their own economies 
and germany is likely to stay at the forefront of international 
support for the soviet union for several reasons not the least is 
the desire to prevent soviets from going hungry and causing a tide 
of refugees to head west 
germany already is a magnet for tens of thousands of foreign 
refugees who sap the countrys resources 
the government plans to start sending many of the refugees to 
the underdeveloped eastern part of the country a move that could 
make germany less attractive to the newcomers 
along with his detenteminded foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher the german chancellor also will be seeking abolition of 
chemical weapons and further curbs on nuclear arms 
kohl told voters he will push even more for the decadeslong 
dream of a united states of europe linking european community 
countries predicting it could come about by the turn of the 
century 
at the same time kohl has promised to remain committed to 
helping solve third world economic woes germany with 78 million 
people is europes no 1 economic power

the dollar gained against the japanese yen for the 
third consecutive trading day today and tokyo share prices closed 
higher 
the dollar closed at 13300 yen up 025 yen from fridays 
13275 yen finish it opened at 13202 yen and ranged between 
13200 yen and 13330 yen some 1144 billion changed hands in 
spot trading 
the dollar now has gained 410 yen in the last three trading 
days 
there is little reason to buy the dollar now considering the 
slowdown in the us economy but investors find less reason to buy 
the yen said naohiko yasuda a dealer with the bank of tokyo 
dealers said the dollars low start today was in reaction to 
president bushs proposal friday for talks with iraq 
it quickly climbed again as investment trust firms bought 
dollars to correct oversold positions since friday they added 
the dollar shot up 260 yen friday after the un security 
council adopted a resolution approving the use of military force to 
drive iraq out of kuwait 
the dollar tends to rise in times of international tension 
because it is seen as a safe investment while speculation of war 
in the persian gulf usually weakens the yen because japan imports 
nearly all of its oil and 70 percent comes from the middle east 
but the dollar failed to keep rising because of lingering 
uncertainties over the middle east yasuda said

currencies as the german mark and british pound mainly because of 
the generally falling tokyo stock market

the winners held victory parties the losers 
postmortems former east germans held their breath waiting for 
the promises of four straight elections to be delivered 
after what has seemed like a single yearlong campaign voters 
in what had until october been a communist country joined germans 
to the west on sunday and elected chancellor helmut kohl to lead 
the united nation 
the election followed east germanys first free elections in 
march its local elections in may and state elections in october 
kohls christian democrats dominated each 
along the way questions of ideology began to shrink into the 
shadow of stark reality for many former east germans 
i care about my house i care about my job about clean air a 
playground for my children hiltrud kluger 36 said after voting 
sunday i dont care about a market economy 
sundays balloting was the last of the nationwide races until 
1994 
the newly elected german parliament now free of the 
hyperbolefilled rhetoric of successive campaigns faces the task 
of dispassionately fixing the broken eastern sector of the nation 
mrs kluger a mother of two lives in the depressed factory 
town of delitzsch in the heart of the former nations heavily 
industrialized southern region 
she would not say who she voted for other than to say it was a 
mainstream party but her reasons for choosing a party were the 
same as many other eastern germans to quickly improve the quality 
of life 
eastern germany is expected to face a sharp rise in joblessness 
in the first quarter of next year many former communist subsidies 
that kept rents energy costs and mass transit fees low will be 
lifted on jan 1 
but optimistic economic forecasts also predict new investment 
that could begin creating new jobs in the middle of next year 
many eastern germans believe kohls conservative free 
marketoriented party is best able to deliver that investment 
hildegard neumann 66 also a delitzsch resident voted for the 
christian democrats in all four eastern elections 
we think that the christian democrats are the capitalists 
she said they are also christians and we need that 
after world war ii mrs neumann worked briefly for the us 
army in west germany as a telephone operator but came back to the 
east to be with family 
she worked as a schoolteacher for 40 years and said she fought 
efforts by authorities to get her to join the communist party 
once i was fired for three years because i said i believed in 
god she said i stayed at home then they came back and said 
they needed school teachers 
despite the delicate financial condition of a pensioner in a 
changing depressed society she said she is confident the 
christian democrats will improve her living standards 
i know weve had four elections but its very good indeed 
that we can finally vote for the people we want in our 
government she said 
although kohls party buried the opposition more than half of 
the nations voters on sunday chose somebody else 
angelika bobbe a 35yearold berliner supported alliance 90 a 
minor party that includes the intellectuals and pacifists who led 
last years revolt against communism 
she was laid off last summer from a government agency that 
refurbished old buildings she has been taking retraining courses 
under a program paid for by kohls government 
there is absolute chaos in this land she said extremism 
greed joblessness was never a problem people dont know how to 
react 
the winners and losers knew how to react after the tentative 
results were in in bonn kohls supporters sipped german sparkling 
wine and gulped chilled german beer the triumphant chancellor sat 
with his wife hannelore on a large pedestal at the front of the 
hall 
at the headquarters of the opposition social democrats solemn 
organizers spoke about mounting a new charge in 1994

aaron copland the immigrants son from brooklyn 
who used jazz rhythms of the south folk songs of appalachia and 
cowboy tunes of the prairie to create classical music that was 
unmistakably american has died at 90 
the composer who lived in peekskill died sunday at phelps 
memorial hospital in north tarrytown of pneumonia he had suffered 
two strokes recently 
the dean of american music created such classics as 
appalachian spring rodeo billy the kid and lincoln 
portrait leonard bernstein once called coplands 1942 orchestral 
composition fanfare for the common man the alltime top of 
the hit parade in american music 
the son of eastern european immigrants he strove to be more 
american than most americans and sought to focus the international 
spotlight on his fellow american composers 
he put american music on the map he decided that there should 
be an american sound a place for the american composer vivian 
perlis who collaborated with the composer on his 1984 memoir 
copland said sunday 
copland wrote two operas six ballets and eight film scores 
including his oscarwinning music for william wylers the 
heiress in 1948 
he won a pulitzer prize in 1945 for the ballet appalachian 
spring based on a shaker melody played by a clarinet it was 
choreographed by martha graham 
his ballets billy the kid in 1938 and rodeo in 1942 make 
use of cowboy tunes and folk songs 
other works included the score for the red pony the 1949 
movie based on the novel by john steinbeck and lincoln 
portrait music performed with narration inspired by the writings 
of lincoln biographer carl sandburg 
the jewish boy from new york who learned to write 
cowboyinspired classical music didnt even travel to the west 
until he was 28 
i preferred to imagine being on a horse without actually 
getting on one he once said 
william schuman who with bernstein and copland formed what 
schuman called a triumvirate of american composers said copland 
believed in the validity of american music that we were not 
inferior to our european cousins 
he created the american sound in symphonic music said 
schuman 
both bernstein and copland wanted to incorporate popular music 
into concert music they always wanted the music to be in contact 
with people said composer elliott carter 
coplands storekeeper parents initially were reluctant to pay 
for music lessons my parents were of the opinion that enough 
money had been invested in the musical training of the four older 
children with meager results he recalled 
but his persistence prevailed and copland eventually studied in 
paris with nadia boulanger and sold a composition the cat and 
the mouse for 3250 
to finally see my music printed means more to me than any 
debut in carnegie hall he wrote home 
in 1925 boulanger on organ premiered symphony for organ and 
orchestra in new york as part of her us debut 
afterward copland recalled conductor walter damrosch addressed 
the audience ladies and gentlemen i am sure you will agree that 
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 
within five years he will be ready to commit murder 
with such jazzinspired creations as piano concerto in 1926 
copland once recalled i felt i had gone to the extreme of where 
jazz could take me the audiences and critics in boston all thought 
i had gone too far 
during a trip to the west copland heard the piece being hissed 
during rehearsal and again in concert at the hollywood bowl 
but he forged on experimenting with even more complex rhythms 
symphonic ode which premiered in 1932 was so difficult 
conductor serge koussevitzky told copland it took an hour to 
rehearse three bars 
then in 1936 copland did a musical aboutturn to a simpler 
folkbased style in el salon mexico inspired by a visit to 
mexico city the work was followed in 1942 by rodeo which 
launched agnes demilles dancing career 
copland who never married is survived by several nieces and 
nephews 
funeral arrangements were incomplete

leonard bernsteins visit to aaron coplands 
studio a half century ago opened the door on a friendship between 
two composers who helped helped put american classical music on the 
world map 
on sunday copland joined bernstein in death 
in life they had created what a composer called the american 
sound 
they were made for each other said the pulitzer 
prizewinning composer david del tredici aaron wrote the music 
and lenny was its wonderful interpreter aaron was the moses and 
lenny was the aaron 
william schuman who with bernstein and copland formed what 
schuman called a triumvirate of american composers said copland 
believed in the validity of american music that we were not 
inferior to our european cousins 
copland and bernstein first met when the young lenny in his 
20s and fresh from harvard showed up at coplands new york studio 
door opposite lincoln center 
copland opened the door bernstein introduced himself and then 
he just sat down and played variations a work by copland said 
del tredici who claims copland as his mentor 
del tredici recalled weekends 20 years ago spent at coplands 
home near new york which he described as a very copland kind 
of place spacious comfortable 
there was no vanity in him he was very endearing he said 
adding that copland didnt care much about food or a fancy 
home 
he was generous to everyone around him and under him and 
uncomplicated said del tredici usually geniuses are 
selfcentered and i thought how can a man be a genius and still 
be so nice 
the downtoearth approach translated into musical artistry that 
drew on american folk tunes and jazz 
like most sons of immigrants he wanted to be more american 
than the americans said del tredici 
at coplands last birthday celebration two weeks ago he ate 
apple pie which he preferred to cake surrounded by old friends 
copland read messages from young people from fifthgraders in 
arkansas to teenagers in arizona 
he was not the least pretentious if you didnt know he was 
one of the greatest artists of the century you would never suspect 
it with his wonderful ruddy laugh said schuman 
he had a uniquely american voice and was able to express in 
his music particularly american sensibilities using substantially 
the language of european serious music said kenneth haas 
managing director of the boston symphony 
copland taught at the orchestras tanglewood music school in 
lenox mass for 25 years and was head of the faculty there when 
he stepped down in 1970 
he lived a very productive 90 years haas said happily 
we will have his music to appreciate even though we dont have him 
any more

few people recognized calvin klein as he quietly 
rehung dresses during a sale of 4 million in merchandise donated 
by fashion designers to benefit the fight against aids 
the clothes donated by klein and more than 100 other us 
designers brought in more than 35 million by the end of the 
threeday sale sunday and surpassed the goal of 1 million 
in an industry where huge egos are legendary what stood out was 
that the fashion leaders were able to put their rivalry aside and 
work together on a cause close to many in the clothing business 
many in the fashion industry including perry ellis have died of 
aids 
with a hundred diverse souls like this its a miracle said 
one organizer 
i think i can see something clicking with the shoppers as they 
see us our camaraderie and see this what the industry has 
wanted to do together for a long time said patricia underwood a 
hat designer whos had her own label for 14 years i think aids 
is starting to mean something to them 
for many designers it was the first time in years they had been 
facetoface with the public most of them stood by unnoticed as 
shoppers hunted down designer merchandise at huge discounts 
thats definitely a 39long designer jeffrey banks told a 
shopper who held up a shirt to her husbands back 
marc jacobs the perry ellis designer helped tear open a carton 
of sweaters as the crowd ignored him and looked at a mannequin 
instead 
nevi sicetola 22 who bought a pair of jeans and a cashmere 
sweater said the sale was chaos but she added its a very 
good cause 
a spokesman for the council of fashion designers of america 
which sponsored the event with vogue magazine said the money will 
be distributed by the new york city aids fund which gives grants 
to aidsrelated causes 
socialite blaine trump wearing a baseball jacket with a logo 
for an aids support group looked for christmas presents william 
f buckleys wife pat came back for a second day new york daily 
news gossip columnist liz smith sifted through sports shirts 
mens designer shirts that normally sell from 80 to 200 went 
for 25 and sweaters selling anywhere from 150 to 500 were 50 
norma kamali socks were selling two pair for 1 dresses that 
normally go for thousands of dollars were halfprice 
the spirit of cooperation even seemed to infect the shoppers 
who had to buy 10 tickets in advance to get in groups of 1500 
waited happily for an hour before being let in for their 2hour 
shopathon shoppers were let in in shifts to control crowding and 
to give designers a chance to restock their tables 
the event was staffed by volunteers some of whom have aids 
ranging from retailers and backroom assistants to fashion students 
klein even seemed to think the event could be repeated 
elsewhere 
i dont see why it couldnt happen in paris london or 
milan he said

dozens of people called johns hopkins hospital 
in response to its offer to test for aids about 1800 patients who 
were operated on by a surgeon who died of the disease 
the hospital said it would send a letter this week to all 
patients dr rudolph almaraz had operated on since joining its 
staff in 1984 the breast cancer specialist died nov 16 at age 41 
of what his familys lawyer marvin ellin said was aids 
ellin said the letter will generate nothing but panic among 
almarazs former patients every ache and every pain they 
experience is going to cause them to wonder if they have aids he 
said 
the hospital received dozens of calls sunday as a result of a 
story in the sun in which ellin said almarez had died of aids 
documents that would confirm his illness including the death 
certificate are confidential under maryland law 
johns hopkins said in its letter that the possibility that the 
aids virus was transmitted to any person during surgery is remote 
ellin said almaraz told him he was exposed to aids when blood 
from an aids patient squirted into his eyes and mouth during an 
operation in new york about seven years ago 
suzanne raussenbert a spokeswoman for memorial sloankettering 
cancer center in new york where almaraz was on a fellowship on 
sunday said the hospital had no records that would indicate almaraz 
contracted aids there he practiced at the hospital in 1983 
almaraz also had privileges at childrens hospital where a 
spokeswoman said almarza never operated and homewood hospital 
south homewood spokesman larry wilson said the hospital will 
consider sending letters to the surgeons patients 
almaraz was surgeoninchief of surgical oncology and 
endocrinology at hopkins until 1985 when he started his private 
practice almaraz sold his practice march 1 and resigned from the 
johns hopkins staff june 30 
dr timothy townsend senior director for medical affairs at 
johns hopkins said the hospital made repeated efforts starting in 
late summer to determine the nature of almarazs illness amid 
rumors that he had aids 
while johns hopkins could not give the exact number of patients 
almaraz operated on townsend estimated the figure at 300 a year 
at that rate he could have operated on more than 1800 patients 
while on the staff 
aids most commonly is transmitted through sexual contact or the 
sharing of needles by intravenous drug users or exposure to tainted 
blood or other bodily fluids 
dr gregory b bulkley a professor of surgery at the hopkins 
medical school said a study has found that a doctor who pricks 
himself while operating on a person with aids has a 02 percent 
chance of picking up the virus 
the risk of a doctor transmitting aids to a patient is so small 
as to be immeasurable he said 
there is only one case in which a patient is believed to have 
contracted the disease from a healthcare provider 
in that case david j acer was a stuart fla dentist who 
died of aids on sept 3 nine months earlier one of his patients 
kimberly bergalis 22 was told she had aids after being 
hospitalized for a form of pneumonia

decades of oil drilling have brought so much 
radium to the surface that radioactive contamination in oil fields 
sometimes exceeds by five to 30 times the level permitted at 
nuclear plants the new york times said today 
the newspaper said environmental officials have found radium a 
naturally occurring radioactive material in every oilproducing 
region in the country from alaska to the gulf states 
they found low levels of radiation in pumps pipes and storage 
tanks from radium that leaches from mineral deposits into water 
that comes to the surface with oil the times said 
the federal government has no regulations to deal with oil field 
radiation the paper said 
the extent of the health risk to oil workers who handle drilling 
equipment contaminated by radium or to people exposed to 
radiumcontaminated water and soil is unknown but health officials 
worry that exposure may raise the risk of cancer and other 
illnesses the times said 
oil industry representatives say the risk is minimal or 
nonexistent the paper said 
the contamination is worst in the south and along the gulf coast 
where radium concentrations in the water are much higher than in 
other regions 
oil companies for years in the south have routinely poured 
billions of gallons of contaminated water into thousands of unlined 
ponds before pumping it back into the ground or releasing it into 
wetlands the times said

japans first space voyage has generated pride 
along with broadsides about the blatant commercialism of the 
venture which cost the nations largest private broadcasting 
company 37 million 
toyohiro akiyama the first japanese and first journalist in 
space was orbiting the earth today with two soviet cosmonauts in a 
soyuz space capsule a day after their blastoff from the steppes 
of soviet central asia 
the rocket carrying akyiyama into space was plastered with the 
logos of nine japanese corporate sponsors including a manufacturer 
of diapers and sanitary products a toothpaste company and a solar 
heater maker 
japanese newspapers praised the mission but gently prodded 
tokyo broadcasting system which footed the bill for 
commercializing the final frontier 
asahi shimbun japans largest newspaper and linked to a media 
group in competition with tbs described the mission as an 
advertising sales blitz 
this flight is supposed to be a practice for allowing other 
laymen into space but it also gives the impression that space 
travel is a business said nihon keizai shimbun a major economic 
newspaper 
tbs is spending 37 million to launch akiyama 48 and broadcast 
his coverage live for the duration of the eightday trip 
the network hopes to arrange a telephone call dec 7 between 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the cosmonauts 
the commercial contract with tbs boosted the kremlins drive to 
cash in on its soyuz space program in the face of critical economic 
problems 
cosmonauts viktor afanasyev and musa manarov will link the soyuz 
capsule with the space station mir they will switch places with 
cosmonauts gennady manakov and gennady strekalov and spend the next 
six months orbiting the earth 
soviet officials and tbs executives have held out the hope that 
the flight could improve ties between the two countries which 
never officially ended their world war ii hostilities 
japanese newspapers also focused on the humaninterest aspects 
of the flight the first laymans venture into space since new 
hampshire schoolteacher christa mcaufiffe and six astronauts died 
in the 1986 challenger explosion 
a regular guy becomes a middleaged star trumpeted the 
sankei shimbun 
prayer smiles and then tears it said of akiyamas wife 
kyoko who watched her husband disappear into space from the 
baikonur cosmodrome 1310 miles east of moscow 
kyoko called the blastoff beautiful although she earlier 
said she was nervous 
but when i saw their faces on the television screen i calmed 
down and felt happier she said 
akiyama is to spend six days aboard mir in addition to his live 
reporting he will carry out experiments to seek how tree frogs 
react to a gravityfree environment

request to stay home even though she doesnt believe earthquakes 
can be forecast 
at this age they really worry about everything war an 
earthquake water the environment mrs byrd said i figured 
if he really was that worried about it it should be up to him

brownings forecast of a 5050 chance for a major earthquake along 
the fault this week 
schools were closed today and tuesday in more than a dozen 
districts in arkansas and missouri classes were also canceled in 
at least three districts in tennessee and several in kentucky and 
illinois 
residents of illinois st clair county were watching cats and 
dogs as well as farm animals for signs of nervousness and had 
considered canceling school today if there seemed to be a problem 
but schoolchildren had their hopes of a day off dashed this 
morning 
we have a special monitoring committee thats been watching 
the animals said bill gullick superintendent of marissa 
community unit school district 40 one of the people on the 
committee is a farmer he was the last person we checked with early

1000 years

town just in case not sterling ivy 
i wouldnt go two steps to try to get away from an earthquake 
because if your time comes youre going to go ivy said outside 
st john missionary baptist church in marked tree 
marked tree lies at the southern end of the new madrid fault 
which runs northeast through new madrid mo up to cairo ill 
browning bases his theory on the gravitational pull of the sun 
and moon which he says will be particularly strong during the 
48hour period on either side of sunday many scientists say that 
the theory is nonsense and that no one can predict earthquakes 
accurately 
in new madrid many residents watched the media circus on main 
street 
i knew there would be a lot of press here but i never had a 
clue it would be like this its just amazing said virginia 
carlson director of the new madrid historical museum where 
reporters photographers and the curious traipsed in and out 
outside the museum which documents huge earthquakes along the 
fault in 1811 and 1812 onlookers took pictures of photographers 
taking pictures of them traffic crawled through jampacked 
streets

alongside the road said leland phillips but now the tshirt 
business has zoomed by the can business

awareness was also high 
i had one guy call and ask if mondays earthquake had been 
canceled said judy drawdy of the memphisshelby county emergency

a judge is investigating whether corruption was 
involved in the awarding of contracts for pope john paul iis visit 
to naples last month newspapers reported 
assistant prosecutor oberdan forlenza opened the probe on 
tuesday 
an opposition leader in naples amedeo laboccetta has charged 
the city government wasted money on the construction of altars and 
platforms for papal ceremonies he criticized the city for awarding 
the contract for a large platform in downtown naples to a company 
in northern italy instead of a local business laboccetta also 
assailed the lack of open bidding on the project 
a lot of money was wasted to let whoknowswho earn a few 
million lire profiting ignobly from a papal visit he said 
according to a report wednesday in the milanbased corriere della 
sera 
the head of the city economic office diego tesorone was quoted 
as saying he awarded the contract without bidding because it was 
urgent he said he chose a company outside naples to avoid 
involving the camorra the neapolitan mafia which traditionally is 
influential in local construction 
the camorra was trying to infiltrate itself in the operation 
and i choosing a company that had worked on other papal trips 
ruined their intervention tesorone told corriere della sera 
labocetta also charged that the city had rented hundreds of 
plastic chairs for a papal mass paying 4 for each one when they 
could have been purchased for 1 less hundreds were reported 
stolen before a papal mass 
the city government spent 14 million to build structures and 
rent chairs for the papal visit nov 911 the reports said the 
pontiff visited neighboring towns nov 1213 
the fiveday trip was his longest papal journey in italy and was 
seen as a symbol of the vaticans faith in the region despite all 
its troubles 
italian government leaders bluntly acknowledge that they have 
lost control of large segments of the countrys southern regions to 
mafia clans

the united states will use its 
nearly 600 million barrel petroleum reserves to stabilize oil 
prices in the event of war in the persian gulf a us embassy 
official said today 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity commented 
after us energy secretary james watkins met sunday with his saudi 
arabian counterpart hisham nazer 
watkins arrived saturday for talks on the oil market situation 
in light of iraqs 4monthlong occupation of kuwait saudi arabia 
controls more than a quarter of the worlds known oil reserves by 
overtaking kuwait iraq increased its share of the worlds oil 
reserves to 20 percent 
saudi official statements only mentioned that the two men 
discussed the world oil market and means of stabilizing it as well 
as bilateral cooperation in the oil industry no details were 
given 
the us embassy official said that watkins and nazer talked 
about the effect of the persian gulf crisis on the world oil 
market as well as ussaudi relations 
they discussed us plans to use strategic petroleum reserves 
in case hostilities broke out and a real shortage emerged said 
the diplomat people tend to panic when a conflict breaks out 
but well do whatever we can to maintain stability 
the united states germany and japan together have about 1 
billion barrels of oil in reserve saudi arabias reserves stand at 
approximately 260 billion barrels two months ago president bush 
said the united states would sell 5 million barrels of the 590 
million stored in 65 saltdome caverns in texas and louisiana in an 
attempt to stabilize prices 
before heading to the united arab emirates today watkins 
visited saudi aramco the worlds largest oilproducing company 
informed sources said on sunday that discussions by watkins and 
nazer included expansion of saudi aramco an oil contingency plan 
in case of war and the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter has played a 
prominent role in almost doubling its oil output to meet the 
shortage on the world market precipitated by iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
the move along with additional production by other opec 
members have helped stabilize oil prices they doubled to around 
40 a barrel at one point and now are about 30 dollars per 
barrel war could push oil prices as high as 100 per barrel 
according to some estimates

four omaha neb automobile dealerships 
seeking to escape lawsuits charging them with violating iowas 
consumer fraud laws lost a supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment left intact an iowa supreme court 
ruling that forces the dealerships to defend themselves in iowa 
courts 
the dealerships had argued that iowas courts have no authority 
over them 
iowas highest court said such authority stems from the 
dealerships placing newspaper advertisements in the omaha 
worldherald which is circulated in iowa 
the state court noted that the dealerships also placed ads in a 
telephone directory for council bluffs iowa which is located just 
across the missouri river from omaha 
the lawsuits filed in 1987 by iowa attorney general thomas j 
miller allege that the ads placed by the dealerships baxter 
chrysler plymouth markel ford john kraft chevroletisuzu and 
olsen auto world were false and misleading 
the suits seek a halt to such advertising practices and 
restitution for any iowa residents who lost money because of the 
challenged ads 
a fifth suit had been filed against dean rawson nisson of omaha 
but that dealership entered into a consent agreement with iowa 
officials 
the constitutions dueprocess protections as interpreted in a 
series of past rulings by the nations highest court bar a state 
court from hearing any lawsuit filed against nonresidents unless 
they have certain minimum contacts with that state 
the iowa supreme court ruled last may that the car dealerships 
advertising efforts are sufficient to render them amenable to 
suit here in an action which seeks to halt that advertising on the 
ground that it is unlawful 
the state court added that the ads also make the dealerships 
vulnerable to those portions of the lawsuits seeking other 
sanctions 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the dealerships argued 
that the may ruling went far beyond established boundaries of state 
court authority 
this case is an attempt by the iowa attorney general to impose 
iowa law against nebraska retailers who advertise their product in 
a nebraska newspaper which ads comply with both nebraska and 
federal law the appeal contended 
the case is baxter chrysler plymouth vs iowa 90583

american telephone amp telegraph co moved to 
become a major player in the computer industry by offering 6 
billion for the ncr corp the nations fifthlargest computer 
maker 
ncr chairman charles e exley jr reacted negatively to the 
offer of 90 worth of atampt stock for each share of ncr and 
criticized atampt for making the takeover discussions public sunday 
in early trading today ncr shares shot up 2475 to 8150 
after a delayed opening on the new york stock exchange atampt shares 
fell 225 to 2987 in heavy trading 
atampt chairman robert e allen said atampt decided to go public so 
ncr stockholders could make their own decisions ncr formerly 
national cash register rejected a bid valued at 85 per share as 
too low on friday 
an atamptncr merger would be the secondlargest takeover of 1990 
after matsushita electric industrial cos 613 billion merger 
with mca inc which was announced last week it would represent 
atampts largestever acquisition 
the merger would greatly increase the presence of the 
longdistance phone service giant and telecommunications equipment 
maker in the computer industry which it entered six years ago with 
the breakup of the bell system 
some observers had long predicted atampt which has made alliances 
with and acquired other hardware and software makers in recent 
years would become one of the major computer makers 
ncr also is a leading maker of automated teller machines and 
cash registers 
atampt said the two companies and their boards have exchanged 
letters and presentations on the proposed acquisition but that 
talks had broken down 
although atampt said it is willing to negotiate all aspects of 
its proposal including price ncr has since repeatedly refused to 
meet with either atampt or its advisers atampt said 
atampt said its 90 offer amounted to 88 percent more than the 48 
ncr stock traded for on nov 7 the day before reports of a rumored 
atampt bid surfaced in the media 
but exley said the 90 offer was only 25 percent more than the 
highest price his companys stock had reached in the past six 
months ncr stock traded for 5675 friday on the new york stock 
exchange 
in a statement sunday night exley said atampt cannot hope to 
achieve the merger without the support and confidence of ncr 
management in atampts integrity and sense of honor 
no ultimatum or demand will likely win that support or 
confidence and no ultimatum or demand will intimidate the board of 
directors of ncr into doing a disservice to the company its 
customers shareholders and employees he said 
atampt said its offer would remain open until the end of business 
wednesday 
it said its purchase of ncr would be particularly beneficial in 
selling computers and other equipment to industries such as 
retailing and banking where ncr has its strength atampt said such 
uses of computers require extensive communications knowhow that 
the company can provide 
under a merger atampts computer line would be combined with 
ncrs and ncr would continue to operate under its own name from 
its dayton ohio headquarters atampt said atampt said that it did 
not expect to close any ncr facilities and that it wanted ncrs 
management to run the combined operation 
ncr which has about 56000 employees announced in september it 
will replace its proprietary computers with socalled open systems 
which adhere to computerindustry standards and can work easily 
with models made by other companies 
ncr earned 412 million on overall revenue of 596 billion last 
year 
atampt with about 279000 employees earned 27 billion on 
overall revenue of 36 billion last year

the supreme court today shielded businesses 
from some bigmoney lawsuits filed by employees who claim they were 
fired so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits 
the court ruled unanimously that fired employees may not sue in 
state courts over such allegations the state suits are preempted 
by a federal law protecting pensions the court said 
the employee retirement income security act of 1974 is aimed at 
assuring workers will get their retirement pay but state lawsuits 
had loomed as potentially far more lucrative because fired 
employees could win punitive damages that greatly exceed lost pay 
writing for the court today in a case from texas justice sandra 
day oconnor said congress clearly intended to preclude state 
lawsuits over firings motivated by efforts to avoid paying pension 
benefits 
the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial 
burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or 
between states and the federal government oconnor said 
the decision is a victory for the ingersollrand co which was 
sued by perry mcclendon after firing him in 1982 
mcclendon had been transferred by the company from san antonio 
to dallas in 1979 to develop a sales market for construction 
equipment there he was fired four months before his 10th 
anniversary with the company 
a worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his 
pension vested which meant ingersollrand would have to contribute 
to mcclendons retirement benefits 
mcclendon sued in texas state courts accusing his former 
employer of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits the 
company said he was fired to reduce the workforce and save money 
mcclendon did not sue for lost pension benefits in fact 
shortly after he sued the company agreed to vest his pension 
instead mcclendons suit sought a potentially bigmoney judgment 
for lost wages mental anguish and punitive damages 
the texas supreme court ruled that mcclendons lawsuit was not 
precluded by erisa the federal law but todays decision reversed 
the state court ruling 
the case is ingersollrand vs mcclendon 891298

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that gave federal officials a deadline for approving tougher air 
pollution controls for two metropolitan areas in arizona 
the justices without comment rejected bush administration 
arguments that a federal appeals court ruling improperly limited 
the governments power in developing plans for improving regional 
air quality 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last may gave the 
environmental protection agency six months to adopt a new plan for 
reducing carbon monxide in phoenix and tucson and surrounding 
areas in maricopa and pima counties respectively 
the deadline was to expire nov 26 but federal officials were 
granted a twomonth extension 
justice department lawyers said the appeals court exceeded its 
authority and may be in conflict with a supreme court ruling issued 
last june 
in that decision the justices reinforced the epas power to 
seek fines against air polluters even when federal officials have 
been slow to approve plans for cleaning up the atmosphere the june 
decision permitted epa enforcement when the agency arguably has 
missed its own deadlines for adopting new rules 
the appeal acted on today said the arizona case should be 
restudied in light of that ruling but state residents seeking 
stricter pollution controls said the june decision is irrelevant to 
the case 
the residents sued the epa claiming pollution control plans it 
approved for the two metropolitan areas are inadequate 
the agency required gas stations to sell high oxygen content 
fuel during winter months when carbon monoxide levels are highest 
large employers to limit commuting by employees driving to work 
alone and upgraded testing of carexhaust emissions 
the plans challengers said additional measures are needed 
including expanded mass transit parking controls bus and car pool 
lanes reduced bus fares and reduced truck travel during peak 
periods 
the 9th circuit court said the epa violated federal law by 
arbitrarily lifting from state officials the burden of proving the 
additional measures would not speed up the attainment of cleaner 
air 
arizona has made no claim that any of the measures is 
impracticable or unreasonable in either maricopa county or pima 
county the appeals court said the epa cannot extract leeway 
from a statute that congress explicitly intended to be strict 
president bush signed a new clean air law in november but the 
arizona residents seeking tougher controls in the two counties said 
the new law appears to have no bearing on their case 
the case is reilly vs delaney 90456

west african troops have forced an end 
to fighting between rival factions and relief workers prepared to 
distribute food today to starving people in the capital as tensions 
relaxed 
the fivenation west african army turned its guns on rebel 
leader prince johnson for the first time sunday when his fighters 
refused to halt their fire 
johnson ended nearly two months of relative peace in the 
liberian capital and broke a ceasefire signed last week by the 
three warring factions by attacking remmants of slain president 
samuel does army on friday 
the mercurial rebel leader told reporters he had become 
impatient with the slow pace of a promised resettlement of the 
discredited government soldiers outside the capital where they had 
been harassing civilians 
a spokesman for the west african intervention force said 
johnsons attack was illconsidered but it has provided a good 
opportunity for us to demilitarize monrovia and sort out these two 
factions 
nkem agetua press secretary to army commander gen joshua 
dogonyaro of nigeria told the associated press today that remnants 
of the liberian army remaining in monrovia had indicated they were 
ready to go to an army barracks 15 miles east of the city and that 
the west africans intended to help them move soon 
many of johnsons men had to be forced back to a base at 
caldwell eight miles northeast of monrovia he said 
in one incident the west africans were seen arresting more than 
50 rebels outside the us embassy no shots were fired then but 
there was a shootout when the west africans forced johnsons men to 
disarm at a bridge linking the city to monrovias port 
agetua said more than 40 johnson fighters were detained sunday 
independent observers put the number at nearer to 200 
the spokesman said no force had to be used against the soldiers 
because they retreated to their barracks 
agetua put the death toll from the fighting at about a dozen 
fighters in all from both sides he said there were no civilian 
casualties 
at least one civilian died during the weekend in an unrelated 
incident johnsons men shot moses willi a parttime guard at the 
british embassy at his home in a northern suburb after neighbors 
denounced the man as a former doe soldier friends said he was a 
former policeman 
all three warring sides have indiscriminately killed civilians 
at least 10000 people have been slain but people in monrovia said 
they feared the soldiers more than the rebels and sympathized with 
johnsons wish to get them out of monrovia 
monrovias first food distribution in months was stopped last 
month because soldiers immediately stole the food from civilians 
the last distribution except for supplementary feeding for 
children near death took place three weeks ago 
people in the street beg for food mothers pleading their 
children have had nothing to eat in days 
dozens of articles are on sale in the city from running shoes 
and tshirts to buttons and batteries but what little food is 
available is too expensive for more people 
the outbreak of fighting in monrovia has diverted attention from 
the main rebel faction of charles taylor which has overrun the 
capital and until signing the ceasefire agreement wednesday was 
the only faction blocking peace 
agetua said us ambassadors peter de vos was acting as an 
intermediary arranging a meeting among all the warring factions 
and leaders of an interim government chosen by liberian exiles 
which taylor does not recognize 
he said he hoped the meeting would be held within two days 
either in monrovia or the neighboring state of sierra leone 
the meeting is to organize modalities of a ceasefire such as a 
camp to which taylors men could be confined and to negotiate an 
interim government agreeable to all parties

the farright republican party suffered a major 
setback in the german election capturing only 21 percent of the 
vote nationwide final results indicated today 
the results wiped out any chance of the party gaining seats 
anywhere and ended fears that voters in former east germany could 
swing to the far right after more than 40 years of communist rule 
in the five new eastern states the republicans received only 
13 percent of the vote while in the western region they received 
23 percent for a nationwide average of 21 percent 
the ultrarightist party shocked the nation in january 1989 by 
getting 75 percent of the vote to gain 11 seats in the legislature 
of former west berlin 
but on sunday the republicans dropped to 24 percent of the 
vote in a united berlin eliminating any chance of them retaining 
seats in the citys legislature 
the party still holds a few seats in some local city councils in 
western germany and the european parliament in strasbourg france 
but the election results indicated their influence was eroding

legislature 
he said that under the soviet constitution the baltic republics 
have a right to secede but only if they first hold referendums and 
then follow procedures established by soviet law 
latvia lithuania and estonia were occupied by the soviet army 
at the start of world war ii and were annexed in 1945 the kremlin 
has refused to recognize their declarations of independence this 
year saying they violate the soviet constitution 
the baltic republics contend they were occupied by force and 
that their annexation is invalid the parliaments of all three 
republics meeting in joint session in vilnius last week called 
for the removal of soviet occupation forces and international 
recognition of their independence 
nishanovs speech indicated the gorbachev government is 
maintaining a hard line on the issue of secession and will not 
allow the union treaty to become an easy way out for republics 
seeking independence 
gorbachev sat on the rostrum during the legislative session but 
did not speak 
the new union treaty replacing one signed in 1924 would give 
the restive republics more economic and political autonomy but a 
strong central government in moscow would retain control over 
defense foreign policy taxation monetary policy electric power 
and transportation 
in addition to the baltic republics armenia georgia and the 
ukraine have said they will not sign the union treaty in its 
current form georgias parliament has declared that it wants full 
independence and there are also strong independence movements in 
armenia and the ukraine 
without mentioning russian republic president boris n yeltsin 
by name nishanov attacked yeltsins proposal for bilateral 
treaties between republics 
forming a union without a center would be a step 
backward after centuries of cooperation between the ethnic groups 
in the soviet union he said 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev the soviet army chiefofstaff 
told the legislature that defense had to remain a function of the 
central government 
he noted that defense installations and academies were spread 
across the country and said nuclear weapons should remain under 
the control of only a few top officials 
no other way of handling nuclear weapons is possible 
akhromeyev said thats how its done both here and in the united 
states

the supreme court today strengthened the right 
of criminal suspects to have lawyers present when they are 
questioned by police 
by a 62 vote the justices overturned the murder conviction of 
mississippi death row inmate robert s minnick who confessed when 
he was questioned without his lawyer present 
the court said minnicks rights were violated even though he 
earlier had consulted with his lawyer and agreed to talk to 
authorities unless the suspect initiates such a talk with police 
the court said he may not be questioned outside the presence of 
his lawyer once he has invoked his right to a lawyer 
in other action the court 
left intact a lawsuit settlement that eased restrictions on 
abortion clinics in illinois 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by two nurses and 
two expectant fathers who said the settlement does not adequately 
protect women or fetuses 
refused to kill a lawsuit against a california community 
colleges officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the 
oncampus performance of a racially charged play 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by the college 
officials 
shielded businesses from some bigmoney lawsuits filed by 
employees who claim they were fired so their employers would not 
have to pay pension benefits 
the court ruled unanimously that fired employees may not sue4 in 
state courts over such allegations the state suits are preempted 
by a federal law protecting pensions the court said 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court in the 
confession case said there can be no doubt that the 
interrogation in question was initiated by the police it was a 
formal interview which minnick was compelled to attend 
since minnick made a specific request for counsel before the 
interview the policeinitiated interrogation was impermissible 
in a dissenting opinion justice antonin scalia said the 
majority was misguided to discourage an honest confession 
he said the ruling undermines a belief in either personal 
responsibility or the moral claim of just government to 
obedience he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist 
justice david h souter did not take part in the case 
minnick and james monkey dyess escaped from clarke county 
miss jail in april 1986 and went looking for guns authorities 
said 
police said the two men fatally shot donald ellis thomas and 
lamar lafferty when the victims returned to thomass mobile home to 
find minnick and dyess there 
minnick was arrested in lemon grove calif on aug 22 1986 
fbi agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a 
lawyer 
minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to answer 
any more questions 
a few days later deputy sheriff jc denham of clarke county 
flew to california and questioned minnick the suspect confessed 
saying he shot lafferty because dyess was threatening to kill 
minnick if he did not 
minnick was convicted in mississippi and sentenced to death 
the mississippi supreme court in upholding his conviction said 
denhams questioning of minnick did not violate a rule the us 
supreme court established in 1981 the high court barred police 
from questioning a suspect who has asked for a lawyer unless the 
suspect initiates the conversation 
today the high court extended that ruling to instances in which 
a suspect already has conferred with an attorney 
kennedy said the 1981 ruling is designed to prevent police from 
badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a lawyer provided 
by the courts famous miranda ruling in 1966 
the threat of badgering is no less after the suspect has talked 
to his lawyer kennedy said 
a single consultation with an attorney does not remove the 
suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to 
waive his rights or from the coercive pressures that accompany 
custody and that may increase as custody is prolonged he said 
the case is minnick vs mississippi 896332

former east german leader erich honecker said 
today that he is not guilty of personally issuing shoottokill 
orders at the berlin wall the adn news agency quoted his lawyer as 
saying 
wolfgang ziegler the lawyer said the ousted communist party 
boss claimed he is not guilty according to criminal codes that 
existed when he was ruling what was then east germany the agency 
reported 
ziegler said it was important to determine whether honecker 
violated firearms laws of former east germany what the laws said 
and how they fit in with the current penal code in effect in a 
united germany 
the lawyer said however that honecker should answer 
politically and morally for acts committed as communist leader 
honecker 78 is wanted by german police on charges he signed the 
shootto kill orders 
soviet military officials have prevented german police from 
serving an arrest warrant to honecker who is at a soviet military 
hospital outside beelitz in former east germany 20 miles south of 
berlin 
earlier today soviet military doctors ordered honecker into a 
cardiology unit at the red army hospital german radio reported 
the sender freies berlin radio station quoted a soviet 
interpreter as saying soviet doctors considered honeckers 
condition serious honecker sought refuge at the hospital in 
april 
a soviet military doctor with the rank of colonel diagnosed 
honecker as having high blood pressure the adn news agency quoted 
igor molotkin the interpreter as saying 
the agency said honeckers wife margot called the doctor early 
this morning and the ousted party boss was carried on a stretcher 
to a cardiology department for treatment 
german police need permission from soviet authorities to enter 
the hospital complex a soviet diplomat said sunday that the 
decision on whether honecker can be turned over to german 
authorities would have to be made at the highest level presumably 
in moscow 
a soviet official at the embassy in bonn refused to comment on a 
report that talks were under way between german and soviet 
officials on handing over honecker whose testimony could be 
potentially damaging to moscow 
berlin justice officials issued the warrant on friday just two 
days before the first free elections in a united germany in 58 
years they based the warrant on new documents recently uncovered 
that incriminate honecker 
honeckers lawyers maintain he is too sick to stand trial 
the arrest warrant charges honecker with personally signing 
shoottokill orders to guards at the berlin wall the border 
between former east and west germany 
the warrant also links honecker directly to the deaths of 
several people killed while trying to flee the repressive east 
german regime before it was toppled in last years peaceful 
revolution 
some 200 people died trying to escape from east germany during 
the 28year existence of the berlin wall and the barbed wire 
barrier that separated the two german states 
honecker also rejected responsibility for issuing the 
shoottokill orders in comments published nov 1 in the 
londonbased weekly newspaper the european

the russians asking questions about 
basketball over the moscowtowashington hot line the cold war 
really must be over 
experts manning the hot line which was rededicated today after 
a 47 million upgrade see evidence of glasnost in test 
transmissions from the soviets 
the project has helped keep the peace all these years and this 
upgrade allows us to have stateofthe art communications lt 
gen jerome b hilmes director of information systems in the 
office of the secretary of the army said at a ribboncutting 
ceremony today 
routine maintenancerelated dispatches have actually become 
chatty 
could we ask an unofficial question about basketball the 
soviets asked last february over the communications link set up 
after the cuban missile crisis to avert the accidental outbreak of 
war could you please tell us how our kurtinaitis performed 
against your snipers 
the soviets were referring to rimas kurtinaitis a 6foot5 star 
from lithuania the national basketball association had invited 
kurtinaitis to challenge eight nba stars in a threepoint shooting 
contest in houston snipers apparently was the soviets 
translation of longrange basketball shooters 
wed like to know how he feels in the nba the soviets 
asked 
friends the americans technicians and linguists on the hot 
line replied in the local newspaper it says that kurtinaitis is 
feeling fine but there are no results from the competition 
theyll probably be in tomorrows paper 
several years ago said tom brothers manager of the hot 
line station at fort detrick you would have never seen that 
technicians working at fort detrick in frederick make sure the 
emergency communications link is available to president bush and 
mikhail gorbachev 
the hot line established in 1963 allows the superpower heads 
of state to circumvent normal diplomatic channels and exchange 
written messages there never was a red phone in the oval office 
an image popularized in many movies 
the modernized operation includes updated transmitters and 
receivers control consoles and two new saucershaped satellite 
dishes replacement parts were becoming scarce for the old dishes 
at this station we never know when the president is using it 
what we do is make sure the hot line is available to him 
brothers said our checks are to make sure the earth 
stationtoearth station link is ok 
this is the lines third upgrade the first hot line a 
transatlantic teletype cable was prone to interruptions 
including one caused by a finnish farmer who cut a cable with his 
plow the very first year in the 1970s a manhole fire north of 
baltimore cut off the cables primary circuit about the same time 
american telephone workers accidentally cut the lines cables 
today each hot line message goes to the soviet union three 
different ways over a land cable and through two satellite 
systems the duplication ensures messages arrive at the kremlin or 
the white house during a crisis 
any message bush sends to gorbachev is encoded and taken to an 
undisclosed terminal point in washington it is transmitted to the 
fort detrick earth station 50 miles northwest of the nations 
capital where the signal is enhanced and relayed to two soviet 
satellites 
the satellites 22300 miles above the equator beam the message 
to antennae south of moscow 
the message is also sent to moscow via intelsat an 
americanowned commercial satellite system based in etam wva 
since 1986 the presidents have been able to accompany their 
written messages with maps charts or other graphics 
it takes a matter of seconds for our communications to reach 
the soviet union said brothers one of 13 field engineering 
corp employees who work at the fort detrick station 
presidents have used the hot line more than 15 times in its 
27year history said norm covert a spokesman for fort detrick 
one of the most notable uses was during the sixday arabisraeli 
war in 1967 president lyndon b johnson advised the soviet union 
of us ship and aircraft movements in the mediterranean following 
an israeli attack on the uss liberty

the food and drug administration today 
approved the first nonprescription drug to treat vaginal yeast 
infections which afflict nearly threefourths of all women at 
least once in their lifetimes 
availability of the drug clotrimazole for nonprescription 
sales will spare many women the inconvenience and expense of going 
to a doctor to get a prescription to treat the common infections 
the fda said 
clotrimazole is highly effective and carries a minimal risk 
said dr carl peck director of the fdas center for drug 
evaluation and research adding that it has a 10year history of 
safe prescription use 
fda has concluded that the switch of this drug to 
nonprescription sale will benefit women especially those with 
recurring infections who will be able to treat themselves he 
said 
peck said that as long as the infection is initially diagnosed 
by a doctor a woman can recognize the symptoms and treat herself 
without needing a prescription 
labeling on the drugs package will say if this is the first 
time you are suffering from vaginal itch and discomfort please 
consult your physician 
in a small number of cases use of the drug can cause allergic 
reactions including burning and a rash more rarely it has caused 
abdominal cramps and bloating the fdas cruzan said 
women who are pregnant are advised not to use the product except 
under a physicians supervision 
vaginal yeast infection or candidiasis is an overgrowth of a 
naturally occurring fungus called candida the overabundance occurs 
when the bodys natural balance of bacteria is upset this often 
occurs with antibiotics or birth control pills 
when the yeast overgrows the resulting infection causes itching 
and burning sometimes with a discharge and soreness 
however other conditions including sexually transmitted 
diseases can cause similar symptoms which is why a woman should 
get an initial diagnosis by a physician said fda spokeswoman susan 
cruzan 
a brochure that will be sold with the product will advise women 
to continue treatment for seven consecutive days even if the 
infection appears to have cleared up before then if signs of the 
infection do not clear up in three days the brochure advises the 
woman should see a physician 
the drug which will be available as a vaginal suppository or as 
a cream is made by scheringplough in kenilworth nj and will 
be sold under the trade name gynelotrimin 
nearly 22 million cases of vaginal yeast infections are reported 
annually the company said and nearly 75 percent of all women will 
experience at least one infection

the supreme court ruled today that a federal 
anticounterfeiting law may be used to crack down on the sale of 
used cars with phony mileage readings 
by 53 vote the court upheld the conviction of raymond j 
moskal manager of a pennsylvania car dealership sentenced under 
the law to six months in prison 
moskal was convicted of taking part in a scheme in which car 
odometers were turned back and ownership titles listing the lower 
mileages were obtained in virginia 
that process called title washing is covered by a 1939 
federal law that makes it a crime to ship falsely made 
documents across state lines said justice thurgood marshall for 
the court 
our conclusion that falsely made encompasses genuine 
documents containing false information is supported by congress 
purpose in enacting the law he said title washes involve 
precisely the sort of fraudulent activities that are dispersed 
among several states in order to elude state detection 
justice antonin scalia in a dissenting opinion said the ruling 
creates a dangerous precedent because the court is interpreting a 
law in a way that seems to conflict with the dictionary meaning of 
words 
falsely made is not the same thing as false he said 
a forged memorandum is falsely made scalia said a 
memorandum that contains erroneous information is simply false the 
temptation to stretch the law to fit the evil is an ancient one 
and it must be resisted 
he was joined by justices sandra day oconnor and anthony m 
kennedy 
justice david h souter did not take part in the ruling 
moskal was convicted with al davis owners of the wholesale car 
dealership in manheim pa that moskal managed and dennis smith 
owner of a dealership in chesapeake va davis and smith did not 
appeal to the high court 
prosecutors said the ownership certificates from davis 
dealership were shipped to contacts in virginia who applied for 
titles in that state with the phony lower mileage figures 
the virginia titles then were sent back to davis and he 
distributed them to area dealers to sell with the used cars 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld the convictions of 
the three men 
but federal appeals courts elsewhere in the nation have struck 
down similar convictions on grounds the federal law did not cover 
odometer tampering 
the case is moskal vs us 89964

moslem and christian sectors of beirut today in the first phase of 
a plan to end the countrys 15yearold civil war

that completed their withdrawal today 
people lined the streets in the christian eastern sector of the 
capital to cheer the government troops women showered the 
soldiers with flower petals rice and scented rose water 
the restitution of state authority is seen as a major 
achievement in the governments efforts to end the civil strife 
that has left more than 150000 people dead

earlier today of the withdrawal of all warring militias from the 
greater beirut area this extends along a 15mile coastal strip 
between the kelb river in the north and damour river in the south 
the army started moving in after the 6000strong lebanese 
forces militia led by christian warlord samir geagea withdrew from 
eastern beirut to positions in the christian hinterland of kesrouan

antiaircraft guns about 1660 tons of ammunition were taken from 
the city over the previous week

christian sectors since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975 
army troops also started deploying in the moslem western and 
southern sectors of the capital and in the predominantly druse 
mountains east and southeast of beirut 
the main moslem shiite and druse militias announced last month

continental airlines holdings inc filed for 
protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws today 
blaming the move on a stunning rise in fuel costs and heavy debts 
accrued in the freespending 1980s 
it was the first bankruptcycourt refugee in the airline 
business since the dramatic leap in fuel prices caused by the 
persian gulf crisis and underscored the financial beating taken by 
all airlines because of a weakening economy with fewer passengers 
flying and booking tickets 
the move also marked a rapidly deteriorating situation for 
continental once the nations biggest airline operator which only 
a few weeks ago rejected the bankruptcycourt option 
based in houston continental is best known as the child of 
onetime airline entrepreneur frank lorenzo who built it into a 
major force in the airline industry through aggressive 
pricecutting and debtfinanced expansion after a previous stint in 
bankruptcy court seven years ago 
continental officials said they expected to operate normally 
through the holiday season and passengers would notice no 
difference in service 
essentially were allowed to treat the traveling public 
travel agents tour operators just as if the bankruptcy hadnt 
occurred said paul p welsh a continental attorney there 
will not be anyone stranded 
the airline filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws in wilmington del where it is incorporated 
under chapter 11 a company gets a reprieve from debts while it 
works out a way to pay the bills and tries to reemerge from court 
protection as a healthy business 
as part of the bankruptcy filing continental said it agreed to 
sell its prized seattletotokyo route to american airlines for 
150 million pending approval of the court 
todays filing marks the second bankruptcycourt stint for 
continental in 1983 amid a bitter labor dispute with the 
airlines unions thenchairman frank lorenzo plunged the airline 
into bankruptcy court scapped union contracts and hired lowcost 
replacements for workers striking at the time 
the incident eventually led to changes in the law to limit 
companies right to abrogate union contracts by bankruptcy filing 
in todays statement continental the nations fifthlargest 
airline said the latest financial woes were brought on by high jet 
fuel costs and a high debt load which have created a temporary 
cash shortage for the airline 
the airline listed total assets of 477 billion and liabilities 
of 585 billion 
continental has made these decisions reluctantly hollis 
harris chairman president and chief executive of continental 
told a news conference in wilmington we couldnt handle the debt 
and the cost of fuel at the same time fuel is our highest item of 
operating costs 
harris said that since july continental was paying 70 milion 
per month more in jet fuel because of the recent runup in oil 
prices he said fuel costs made up about a quarter of its operating 
costs 
continental lost 883 million in the third quarter of this 
year compared with a loss of 158 million in 1989 for the first 
nine months losses totaled 97 million compared with a 5228 
million loss last year 
harris said he forsaw no need for layoffs pay cuts or 
reductions in benefits to the airlines 37000 employees as a 
result of the bankruptcycourt move 
raymond e neidl an airline analyst with dillon read amp co in 
new york said if continentals creditors agree to a reorganization 
plan early on they still have chance of survival because 
they have a good solid domestic system and they have a low 
operating cost structure 
continental which was known as texas air corp until this 
summer is the parent of continental airlines and eastern airlines 
eastern filed for bankruptcy protection in 1989 and has been run by 
a governmentappointed trustee since april 10 
continental had been rumored to be considering filing for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy for the past several weeks 
as recently as late october the company said its board of 
directors including lorenzo unanimously rejected a proposal to 
file saying it would consider possible asset sales cost controls 
or seek new investors 
continental sold a 168 percent stake to scandinavian airline 
system in august and lorenzo stepped down as chairman although he 
remains on the board

trying to build a memorial to americas women veterans mrs 
hoffman has contributed more than 60000 to the project all from 
disability payments she received after breast cancer forced her to 
leave the service in 1945 
mrs hoffman now an 83yearold widow says women veterans need 
their own memorial 
male war veterans have their monuments and memorials but we 
are the last group to unite she said from her home in 
hyattsville md i do feel its so well worth it 
mrs hoffman spent two years in the wac as an occupational 
therapist stationed at woodrow wilson hospital in staunton va 
her job was to go from bedside to bedside helping injured soldiers 
make wallets or belts or teaching them to type or knit 
i didnt have a sense of humor when i first went into the 
military she remembered i was a little oldfashioned wearing 
my hair up but the army made me over believe me 
mrs hoffmans small story is one of almost 50000 collected so 
far for a databank that will be part of the memorial said retired 
us air force brig gen wilma vaught president of the women in 
the military service of america foundation 
vaught is delighted with mrs hoffmans generosity but she 
needs a total of 25 million for the memorial and at the moment 
shes about 225 million short 
there are over 12 million living women veterans and 400000 
women on active duty and in the guard and reserve who are 
potential donors vaught said in a recent interview at the 
foundations arlington va offices 
part of vaughts problem is finding those women as well as the 
descendants of the thousands of american women who served in every 
war since the revolution as nurses scouts suppliers soldiers 
and saboteurs 
privacy laws prevent vaught from getting the addresses of 
veterans or activeduty military women from the government she has 
been relying on some 450 volunteers to find them 
the women in military service memorial also suffered a 
fundraising setback this year the foundation tried to raffle a 1 
million house in suburban centreville va only to see ticket 
sales fall far below target 
we saw this as a mechanism that in a really short period of 
time we could raise a lot of money vaught said 
but the kickoff coincided with the drug trial of dc mayor 
marion barry and media attention was nominal she said 
when the date for the drawing approached in early november the 
foundation had sold only about 24000 of the one million raffle 
tickets printed vaught was forced to postpone the drawing until 
feb 23 
theres been progress in other areas the site has been chosen 
the ceremonial entrance gate to arlington national cemetery the 
foundation conducted a design competition last year and selected a 
concept by marion g weiss and michael manfredi partners in a new 
york architecture firm 
their design sets 10 39foot glass spires into the top of the 
semicircular gate known as the hemicycle inside the entrance 
walls will be a museum portraying the history of women in the us 
military a 225seat auditorium and the databank 
at night the spires will be gently lit giving the effect of 
candles against the virginia hillside 
vaught is very conscious that time is essential under the law 
authorizing the memorial vaught has until november 1991 to raise 
the 25 million 
that date may be a little optimistic she said adding that 
she is prepared to go back to congress to ask for more time 
meanwhile as she travels the country meeting women veterans and 
promoting the memorial she is most impressed by the world war i 
veterans 
we still have a few world war i women left who can make it to 
the dedication she said if were going to do something to say 
thankyou to them its got to be now

the supreme court today resolved conflicting 
rulings by federal appeals courts around the country over the 
deadline federal employees face when suing over alleged onthejob 
bias 
the court by a 62 vote said such suits against federal 
employers sometimes may be allowed even if the 30day deadline is 
missed 
some appeals courts had disallowed such waivers for suits 
against the federal government while allowing more deadline 
flexibility in suits against private employers 
but by a separate 71 vote the court ruled that the 30day 
deadline begins when the office of the suing persons lawyer 
receives a righttosue letter from the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission 
there had been some confusion in lower courts about whether the 
30day period began to run only when the suing persons themselves 
or their lawyers not their lawyers office received notice of the 
right to sue 
writing for the high court in a texas case chief justice 
william h rehnquist said federal courts need not throw out all 
such bias lawsuits filed past the deadline 
but rehnquist added that no waiver is required when the delay 
was caused by a lawyers absence from the law office where the 
righttosue notice was received 
the decision killed a suit by shirley w irwin a handicapped 
former employee of the veterans administration medical center in 
waco texas 
irwins suit said the va fired him illegally in 1986 
justices byron r white and thurgood marshall voted to make the 
30day deadline apply to all suits by federal employees regardless 
of the reason for delay 
justice john paul stevens voted to have the 30day deadline 
begin to run only when the suing employees themselves receive 
notice of their right to sue 
the case is irwin vs va 895867

president bush today hailed 
extraordinary political and economic change in the western 
hemisphere as he kicked off a fivenation south american visit he 
vowed not to let his tour be interrupted by military turmoil in 
argentina 
in an appearance before a joint session of the brazilian 
congress bush praised brazil for being among the first countries 
to impose economic sanctions against iraq he said the high oil 
prices resulting from the persian gulf crisis are costing brazil 5 
billion annually however local experts said bushs figure seemed 
excessive 
i realize the sacrifices that saddam husseins brutality has 
caused this nation bush siid departing from his prepared text 
as the president arrived in brazil at dawn nationalist officers 
seized army headquarters at buenos aires and president carlos menem 
declared a state of siege a presidential spokesman said 
bush scheduled to visit argentina and hold talks with menem on 
wednesday told reporters i have no thoughts of changing my 
plans i have great confidence in the security there 
bushs top state department aide on latin america bernard 
aronson said the situation in argentina was all right 
i dont know if its entirely over but it doesnt sound too 
serious theres a small group in the military that has certain 
grievances and every once in while something like this happens 
said aronson who was traveling with bush 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger accompanying 
bush on his trip telephoned the us embassy in argentina and was 
told that rebel forces were in three locations in buenos aires 
government forces were en route to talk them into giving up 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
fitzwater added that it seems likely the incident was intended 
to embarrass menem before bushs visit 
its also the reason we want to make clear our support for 
democracy and president menem fitzwater said 
in another development police said bombs exploded sunday in a 
mormon chapel and in the offices of two rightwing political 
parties in chile another country on bushs travel schedule 
authorities blamed a small radical leftist guerrilla group 
an anonymous caller told a news agency that the blasts were an 
offensive to protest bushs visit to santiago on thursday 
bush seemed in good spirits as he arrived at a military air base 
here 
bush and president fernando collor de mello opened their meeting 
by talking about the impact on world oil prices and the global 
economy of iraqs takeover of kuwait 
bush mentioned the figure 15 billion presumably talking about 
the impact that president vaclav havel told him the occupation was 
having on czechoslovakia thats why when people say to me that 
this can go on and on i say no bush said 
later in his speech to congress bush hailed the 
extraordinary political and economic change that is transforming 
the face of this hemisphere 
he described brazil as a leader in this effort citing collors 
efforts at reducing the size of the state privatizing enterprises 
combatting inflation and liberalizing trade 
these steps he said are the keys to growth and prosperity in 
the global economy of the 21st century 
he added our thinking must be bold our will resolute our 
challenge now is to hew out of a wilderness of competing interests 
a new kind of opportunity in the americas 
to fulfill the new worlds destiny all of the americas and 
the caribbean must embark on a venture for the coming century to 
create the first fully democratic hemisphere in the history of 
mankind bush said 
there were no urgent issues to be discussed on bushs agenda 
but he wants to associate himself with what he sees as a rare 
opportunity in hemispheric relations the first four countries on 
bushs itinerary brazil uruguay argentina and chile all were 
under military rule within the last few years and now have elected 
governments the fifth country venezuela has been democratic 
since 1958 bush is making the trip at a time of unusual harmony in 
uslatin american relations 
the south american tour was to have taken place in september but 
was postponed because of the persian gulf crisis secretary of 
state james a baker iii stayed behind in washington to deal with 
that issue 
the centerpiece of bushs policy toward latin america is the 
enterprise for the americas initiative which is designed to 
achieve economic growth through expanded trade and investment and 
reduced debt 
bushs goal is a hemispherewide free trade area just a week 
ago bush was in mexico to push for a bilateral free trade 
agreement with that country 
although military rule gave way to elected government in much of 
the hemisphere during the 1980s the decade was a disaster 
economically production investment and consumption all fell 
sharply 
collor is part of a new generation of latin leaders who have 
moved aggressively to reduce the state role in the economy and to 
reduce inflation through spending cuts inflation dropped 
dramatically shortly after collor took office in march but is now 
again on the rise 
brazils foreign debt is 112 billion the largest in any 
developing country the country is almost 10 billion in arrears on 
debt repayments and is negotiating a new repayment schedule with 
creditors 
in what the administration sees as a breakthrough in its goal of 
nuclear nonproliferation brazil and argentina last week agreed to 
renounce the manufacture of nuclear weapons

chancellor helmut kohl who triumphed in 
the first free allgerman elections in 60 years began talks today 
on forming a new coalition and discussed the new germanys role in 
the persian gulf 
on international levels one is conscious of a special 
responsibility he told reporters a day after his centerright 
coalition rode to victory buoyed by his own popularity as a 
champion of quick unity 
but kohl indicated germany would probably not be able to quickly 
make a constitutional change that would be needed to allow the 
deployment of german troops in the persian gulf or elsewhere 
outside nato areas 
we will discuss this within the coalition i dont see this 
situation at the moment he said kohl himself proposed the 
amendment but many of the opposition social democrats have 
criticized it 
kohl said he had already begun initial talks on forming a new 
coalition with his christian democratic unions current governing 
partners the christian social union and the free democrats 
he has indicated he wants to have his cabinet in place by 
christmas but his coalition colleagues are pressing him for 
instant decisions on his next cabinet 
one decision was made for him when economics minister helmut 
haussmann said he was quitting the cabinet amid what german 
television claimed was growing criticism over haussmanns handling 
of the economy 
haussmann was a major force in putting together the economic and 
monetary union of west germany and east germany in july a crucial 
step toward full unification oct 3 he gave no reason for 
quitting 
but stern magazine released an interview with central bank chief 
karl otto poehl who criticized kohls plans to borrow up to 100 
billion next year to finance unification poehls comments were 
confirmed by the bundesbanks press office 
the big losers in sundays elections were the leftist social 
democrats the main opposition party and the farleftist greens 
both parties had criticized kohls rapid pace of unification and 
accused his christian democrats of underplaying the cost of bring 
the east up to the standard of the west 
the greens europes mostestablished ecology movement lost 
most of their seats in parliament receiving only 39 percent of 
the vote in western germany the social democrats led by oskar 
lafontaine polled 335 percent 
kohls centerright governing coalition won 548 percent of the 
vote 
the government put turnout at 785 percent of 60 million 
eligible voters 
berlin the united germanys designated capital held its 
first combined city elections in 44 years sunday the conservative 
slate won the most votes but appeared to lack the majority needed 
to unseat mayor walter mompers social democratled administration 
the christian democrats were projected to win 401 percent of 
the vote in berlin compared to 303 percent for the social 
democrats 
sundays elections marked the first free balloting in a united 
germany since adolf hitlers rise to power ended in the devastation 
of world war ii and capped a year of political victories for kohl 
the 60yearold chancellor who championed the swift merger of 
the two germanys and now begins a third fouryear term was 
jubilant and confident after his victory 
but he conceded difficult challenges lie ahead especially 
restructuring the economy in eastern germany 
i have never kept secret the problems that we have kohl 
said in a televised panel discussion that included lafontaine it 
is a difficult transition period 
he predicted however that within four years prosperity will 
exist across all of germany that the strengths of the social 
market economy reasonably applied will create a huge united 
flourishing landscape 
lafontaine acknowledged his party had misjudged the popularity 
kohl won in uniting the two germanys he also conceded that in 
the long term people will be better off in what was east germany

state casino investigators today 
expressed concern about the financial stability of donald trumps 
taj mahal casino resort but said it was still too early to 
accurately predict the gambling halls fate 
in a statement before the state casino control commission 
deputy attorney general thomas auriemma said the taj mahals slot 
machine performance continues to lag and that a debt restructuring 
agreement reached with bondholders on nov 16 fails to reduce the 
gambling halls 675 million debt 
the taj mahal is not reducing its overall debt auriemma 
said 
auriemma and trump attorney nicholas ribis agreed that the 
commission can examine the restructuring agreement although its 
exact terms have yet to be finalized 
auriemma also said it was it was too soon for state gaming 
regulators to gauge whether the agreement would stabilize the 
casino 
he spoke as the casino commission opened a hearing to examine 
the financial stability of the taj which opened last spring and is 
undergoing restructuring that will temporarily throw it into 
bankruptcy court 
if they conclude that the casino is financially unstable the 
commission members could lift its license and appoint a conservator 
to operate it 
trump himself was not at the hearing this morning it is 
expected to last at least two days the flamboyant developer 
author of the best seller the art of the deal has battled 
financial and marital problems for most of the year 
since gambling came to the boardwalk in 1978 only one of 13 
casinos elsinores atlantis casino hotel has lost its license 
because of financial problems 
the commission had planned to evaluate all three trump casinos 
the trump castle trump plaza and taj mahal after giving its 
approval in august to a 65 million emergency bank loan in june 
that allowed trump to make an overdue payment to trump castle 
bondholders trump put up his casinos as collateral for the new 
loans 
commission spokesman tom flynn said the regulatory panel will 
look only at the taj mahal for now but may check the trump castle 
and trump plaza later 
it would have been too cumbersome to look at all three 
flynn said 
among the evidence at todays hearing is an august report on the 
casino issued by the state division of gaming enforcement that 
accurately predicted trump would miss a 473 million interest 
payment to taj mahal bondholders nov 15 
that report concluded simply put the trump organization is 
in dire financial straits 
an updated report on the casinos status will also be submitted 
said gaming division spokesman wayne marlin he would not comment 
on the contents of that report 
marlin said the division an arm of the attorney generals 
office would not take a position on whether the taj mahal should 
keep its license 
stephen bollenbach chief financial officer of the trump 
organization said the commission would find the restructuring for 
the taj mahal leaves the casino in sound shape despite a weakened 
economy 
based on the revised deal with bondholders theres no doubt 
were financially stable bollenbach said nothing in the world 
we live in today looks like it did six months ago 
trump who is restructuring 675 million in taj mahal bonds 
will enter into a prepackaged bankruptcy filing that allows the 
casino to emerge quickly from court protection he made the deal 
shortly after missing the nov 15 interest payment 
the agreement cuts the bonds interest rate from 14 percent to 
12 percent and gives bondholders half the stock in the taj mahal 
the taj mahal set city records for gross gaming revenues or 
win but still reported losing 11 million during the third 
quarter of this year the casino said its gross profits were 
dragged down by 2651 million in interest payments

blocked a tunnel that cross the parana river north of the capital 
to prevent a column of rebel tanks and armored vehicles from 
leaving entre rios province 
the army chief of staff gen martin bonnet said in a 
communique that the army is under the orders of their commanders 
except for small groups that are being put under control 
in the capital rebels fired at and hit a helicopter carrying 
vice president eduardo duhalde as it landed on the roof of 
government house two blocks from the downtown army headquarters 
duhalde was unhurt 
gunfire was heard in the port zone two blocks to the other side 
of government house where menem and duhalde have their offices 
bush who arrived in brazil today said his visit was still on 
i have no thoughts of changing my plans i have great 
confidence in the security there he told reporters in brazil 
bushs top state department aide on latin america bernard 
aronson said the situation in argentina was all right 
i dont know if its entirely over but it doesnt sound too 
serious theres a small group in the military that has certain 
grievances and every once in while something like this happens 
said aronson who was traveling with the president 
white house spoksman marlin fitzwater added that it seemed 
likely the incident was intended to embarrass menem before bushs 
visit 
its also the reason we want to make clear our support for 
democracy and president menem fitzwater said 
the insurrection was the first in argentina since menem took 
office in july 1989 he is the countrys second civilian president 
since the military ceded power in 1983 
all of the previous insurrections have been by officers who 
declare themselves nationalists and demand pay increases pardons 
for rights abuses during the 197683 military regime and changes 
in the military high command 
military pay like the pay of most argentines has been 
severely reduced by hyperinflation and government budget cuts 
a spokesman for the rebels an unidentified lieutenant said 
this is not a coup we recognize the authority of president menem 
as commanderinchief 
but he told reporters our generals dont represent the 
sentiment nor the thought of our army 
a rebel spokesman retired maj hugo abete said the plotters 
were followers of col mohammed ali seineldin who was cashiered 
after he led the previous military uprising in december 1988 
seineldin has been under military arrest for several weeks for 
delivering a letter critical of the high command to menem he is 
held at a base in san martin de los andes about 1000 miles south 
of the capital

the us defense secretary today told lawmakers that kuwait 
would not satisfy saddam husseins appetite for conquest the 
iraqi president again linked the palestinian question with iraqs 
occupation of kuwait 
defense secretary dick cheney said in washington that the united 
states could not wait indefinitely for economic sanctions to drive 
iraq out of kuwait 
despite the pain he is inflicting on his own people there is 
no indication that saddam hussein is open to a peaceful resolution 
of the problem he has created cheney told the senate armed 
services committee 
the united states cannot trust saddam when he tells us his 
intentions are benign cheney said if he gets away with 
swallowing kuwait his appetite for conquest will hardly be 
satisfied 
his testimony followed statements from former us military 
officials and several us lawmakers urging that the united states 
give economic sanctions against iraq more time to take effect 
meanwhile us and british military officials said iraq tested 
surfacetosurface missiles on sunday the missiles which have a 
range of 400 miles were fired and landed within iraqi territory 
cheney said iraq fitted similar missiles with conventional 
warheads during its war with iran but the missiles also could 
carry chemical warheads 
in an interview broadcast sunday by a french television network 
saddam said the chances of war in the persian gulf stand at 
5050 with the outcome depending on the discussions between 
his government and secretary of state james a baker iii 
president bush in the latest initiative to end the iraqi 
occupation of kuwait offered on friday to send baker to baghdad 
and the iraqis accepted 
saddam did not respond to the french reporters questions about 
the possibility of an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
but he said the dialogue with baker would have to deal with 
israels withdrawal from the territories occupied by israel in the 
1967 middle east war lands where most residents are palestinians 
the united states has rejected any such linkage 
if they want to make this meeting a real path toward dialogue 
then we are closer to peace saddam said 
but if they want to make this meeting nothing other than a 
formal exhibition for the american congress the american people or 
international public opinion simply to give themselves good 
conscience to say there weve tried to dialogue with iraq 
without iraq renouncing its positions in that case were closer 
to war 
some us observers have said bushs offer to hold talks with 
iraq was lip service for critics who say his administration is 
moving too quickly toward war the un security council in a 
resolution thursday authorized force against iraq if saddam does 
not withdraw his troops from kuwait by jan 15 
the united states has about 240000 troops among the 
350000strong force in the gulf region by next month the number 
of us soldiers in the force assembled against iraq is expected to 
swell to around 400000 
us marines began a fourday amphibious exercise sunday the 
fourth since operation desert shield began after the occupation of 
kuwait on aug 2 military officials refused to dislose the 
location of the practice landings the number of marines involved 
or whether forces from other countries took part 
also sunday us energy secretary james watkins met with saudi 
arabian oil minister hisham nazer in riyadh the saudi capital to 
discuss plans to expand saudi oil production and to keep prices 
from skyrocketing in the case of war 
a us embassy official in riyadh said today that the united 
states will use its nearly 600 million barrel strategic petroleum 
reserve to stabilize oil prices in the event of war 
they discussed us plans to use strategic petroleum reserves 
in case hostilities broke out and a real shortage emerged said 
the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity people tend to 
panic when a conflict breaks out but well do whatever we can to 
maintain stability 
crude oil prices doubled to around 40 a barrel soon after 
iraqs invasion but have fallen to as low as 29 since if war 
breaks out they could shoot up as high as 100 a barrel according 
to estimates by oil officials 
the plane carrying former heavyweight boxing champion muhammad 
ali and 17 former hostages made an emergency landing in amman 
jordan today after developing technical problems shortly after 
takeoff the jet departed for new york again after about seven 
hours on the ground 
a spokesman said ali plans to return to baghdad on christmas eve 
to seek freedom for other hostages the 15 american hostages and 
two canadian hostages with ali left iraq on sunday 
the americans had been among those foreigners held at strategic 
sites in iraq to deter an attack by the usled multinational 
force

israeliallied militiamen today killed five 
lebanese guerrillas in a firefight in israels selfproclaimed 
security zone in southern lebanon army officials said 
there were no casualties among fighters of the israelifinanced 
south lebanon army militia army officials said 
the guerrillas first fired a number of rocketpropelled grenades 
at a position of the militia 1000 yards northwest of alman which 
is five miles northwest of israel 
the israelbacked fighters returned fire and began a threehour 
chase up the litani river estuary that ended in a battle in which 
four of the guerrillas were killed and a fifth died later of 
wounds military sources said 
the guerrillas were armed with the sovietdesigned klashnikov 
assault rifles and two rocketpropelled grenade launchers the army 
officials said 
artillery duels rocked the region during the chase the 
officials said 
they said the guerrillas apparently belonged to a lebanese 
branch of the baath party and the lebanese resistance front which 
was responsible for several suicide attacks against israeli forces 
in 1985 aimed at pushing them out of lebanon 
last week five israeli soldiers and two palestinian guerrillas 
were killed in a clash on the eastern sector of the buffer zone 
the army said those guerrillas belonged to the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine a plo faction led by george habash 
israel carved out the 440 square mile security zone as a buffer 
protecting its northern border against guerrilla raids in 1985 
when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from lebanon after a 
threeyear occupation 
the zone is jointly patrolled by israeli soldiers and some 2700 
members of the mostly christian south lebanon army

house republicans reelected their leadership 
team today in voting marked by the deep divisions and frustrations 
that come from being the minority party for more than three 
decades 
house minority leader robert mchel of illinois and whip newt 
gingrich of georgia were reelected to the no 1 and no 2 jobs 
without opposition when the 167 republicans assembled in the 
cavernous cannon caucus room the terms last two years 
then in a toughly fought contest for republican conference 
chairman the no 3 leadership post incumbent jerry lewis of 
california defeated challenger carl pursell of michigan 9864 
and in a bitter contest for chairman of the partys house 
campaign arm national republican congressional committee chairman 
guy vander jagt of michigan survived a challenge by rep don 
sundquist of tennessee 9866 
it has been 36 years since any republican in the house of 
representatives could call a hearing to order preside over the 
chamber or take primary credit for a piece of legislation 
house republicans suffered an additional indignity and stepped 
up their renewed infighting when their already small numbers were 
reduced further by last months elections 
there is a big feeling that we just have to get a broom in 
there and sweep the place out said one sixterm republican 
speaking only on condition of anonymity but there are others who 
feel a bloodletting is not what we need 
the two hotly fought contests are symptoms of the same mood 
which gripped the electorate in this years campaign throw the 
rascals out said another senior gop lawmaker few republicans 
wanted to be interviewed on the subject and those who did insisted 
on anonymity 
both contests also pointed out a deeper division within the 
party one that splits house republicans from the white house when 
bush wants to win a fight on capitol hill he most often goes to 
the senate where the numbers are less stacked against him 
they see themselves manipulated and taken advantage of by 
their own white house and condescended to by the democrats said 
norman ornstein a longtime congresswatcher at the american 
enterprise institute a conservative washington think tank 
the split with the white house widened in the years battles 
over the federal budget many house republicans felt left in the 
lurch by bush when he abandoned the nonewtaxes pledge that helped 
elect him in 1988 
gingrich led a group of renegade house republicans against the 
president the congressional committees chief political operative 
ed rollins advised candidates to run against bushs budget lewis 
stuck with the white house but pursell did not 
those familiar with the byzantine world of house party politics 
say white house anger over that move along with a number of 
rivalries were at work in todays contests 
others pointed to the relatively poor performance of vander 
jagts committee over the past decade 
despite gop domination of the white house and the expenditure of 
millions of dollars republicans have won more than 50 house seats 
that they have later lost back to the democrats 
this year the gop lost a net of eight seats giving the 
democrats a 100member majority coupled with mixed results in 
governors races and in state legislatures the result was 
disappointing in a year when the party had hoped for gains that 
would give them an advantage when house seats are reapportioned 
before the 1992 elections

president hussain muhammad ershad 
beset by increasingly violent opposition protests offered today to 
resign before presidential elections next year and to lift a state 
of emergency 
the 60yearold former army general said on staterun television 
he was willing to resign 45 days before the election scheduled for 
june the opposition demanded that he step down immediately instad 
he has not announced any time frame for the elections and thus 
he intends to buy time to hoodwink the opposition this is not 
acceptable said kamal haider spokesman for the countrys major 
opposition alliances 
the opposition had said previous elections were rigged and had 
demanded that ershad quit to allow a caretaker government to 
supervise the balloting 
the president said in his television address that he would 
revoke the 6dayold state of emergency on dec 16 under it civil 
liberties have been suspended including the right to assemble in 
public places 
he said also he was willing to dissolve parliament now 
dominated by his party and hold elections when the presidential 
vote is held 
ershad who seized power in a 1982 coup had denounced the 
campaign against him as an attempt to destroy the national 
economy 
his surprise offer to step aside came hours after security 
forces in bangladeshs secondlargest city chittagong opened fire 
on students hurling homemade bombs reporters in the port city said 
at least 50 people were hurt in the clash 
the government says six people have died throughout the country 
since the state of emergency was imposed but opposition leaders 
put the death toll at 75 they say 3000 people have been wounded 
and 5000 arrested 
in the past some opposition claims have been exaggerated while 
some government tolls have been understated because of chaos and 
poor communications independent verification has not been 
possible 
earlier today the government lifted censorship that was imposed 
with the state of emergency the information ministry said in 
telexes sent to news offices it said the move was due to the 
improvement of overall situation in the country 
all newspapers including those owned by the government stopped 
publishing when the state of emergency was declared because 
journalists refused to work under censorship there was no 
immediate word on when they would resume publication 
on sunday censorship was eased for four international news 
agencies including the associated press but correspondents were 
cautioned to remain objective 
the curfew ordering people to stay indoors was imposed in 
chittagong dhaka khulna and rajshahi when the state of emergency 
was declared 
chittagong whose population is about 2 million was a frequent 
flashpoint between ershads supporters and opponents 
the injured in chittagong 125 miles southeast of dhaka 
included a policeman who lost both eyes in a bomb blast and five 
other members of the security forces reporters said 
todays riot began when about 1000 students set off crude bombs 
and attacked vehicles in a shopping district the trouble occurred 
during a 15hour break in the curfew imposed as part of the state 
of emergency 
in dhaka a city of 7 million people shops opened and traffic 
returned to the streets with the lifting of the curfew today 
government offices and banks lso resumed business 
the opposition parties had called for 6 am to 2 pm 
nationwide strike every day beginning tuesday to maintain the 
pressure against ershad the two main opposition leaders sheik 
hasina and khaleda zia called on government employees to resign 
and for noncooperation with ershads government 
the two rival opposition leaders combined forces in october in 
an attempt to oust ershad

defense secretary dick cheney and the chairman 
of the senate armed services committee clashed today over whether 
economic sanctions will force iraq to withdraw its army from 
kuwait 
cheney testifying at senate hearings on the bush 
administrations persian gulf policy said he saw no indication 
that iraqi leader saddam hussein is willing to settle for a 
peaceful withdrawal 
there is no guarantee that sanctions will force him out of 
kuwait cheney said he insisted the united states could not 
wait indefinitely for the embargo to work while saddam uses the 
time to prepare for an attack 
cheneys comments prompted committee chairman sam nunn a 
georgia democrat and critic of bushs gulf policy to question the 
administrations attitude toward sanctions 
if we have a war were never going to know whether they would 
have worked would we he asked cheney 
thats the major point here the way you find out if sanctions 
are going to work is to give them enough time to work nunn said 
cheney said nunn was assuming that sanctions will work if given 
enough time 
thats a big assumption cheney said theres a big 
difference between saying we know if we use military force we can 
achieve our objectives and it may be if we wait a year or two 
economic sanctions will get him out of kuwait as well 
cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff were the first administration officials to appear before the 
committee following president bushs dramatic announcement friday 
that he was sending secretary of state james a baker iii to bagdad 
to meet with saddam 
cheney responding to democratic pleas to give the sanctions 
more time to work said there are consequences costs to our 
coalition partners and to the country 
it isnt a clean clearcut choice cheney said 
he said the united states cannot trust saddam when he tells us 
his intentions are benign 
despite the pain he is inflicting on his own people there is 
no indication that saddam hussein is open to a peaceful resolution 
of the problem he has created cheney told the committee 
if he gets away with swallowing kuwait his appetite for 
conquest will hardly be satisfied cheney said 
cheneys testimony came on the heels of statements from former 
us military officials and several lawmakers that bush should 
allow the united nations sanctions more time to take effect before 
opting for war 
the same fears were expressed today 
im concerned that we dont have a consensus here in this 
country that would support a war said sen robert c byrd 
dwva a member of the panel and president pro tem of the senate 
sen john glenn dohio voiced misgivings about the chicken 
little approach to our policy the sky is falling and the only 
option is war 
the defense secretary defended bushs decision to send an 
additional 200000 troops to the gulf region last month to supplant 
the more than 240000 in the area 
he also said additional deployments are possible and the 
question of troop rotation has been put aside for now 
we have not put any upper limit on deployments and we are 
basing our strength in the region on the advice of the commanders 
on the scene and the ever increasing size of iraqs forces in 
kuwait cheney said 
nunn said the question is whether iraq will leave without a war 
or following a war 
the real debate in congress and the country is whether to 
punish iraq slowly or with military action nunn said 
cheney refused to back down from his position that sanctions 
alone is not the answer 
such a policy would give saddam a long breathing space in 
which he could concentrate his efforts the defense secretary 
said because he could ignore the possibility of military option 
he could use the breathing space to work around the embargo break 
up the alliance enhance his military strength in kuwait and move 
ahead on his nuclear weapons program 
the united nations has called for iraq to leave kuwait restore 
the legitimate government to that oilrich emirate and free all 
western hostages baker plans to travel to baghdad between now and 
jan 15 to meet with saddam 
on friday bush announced his latest initiative aimed at finding 
a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis before jan 15 the deadline 
the un security council has set for iraq to leave kuwait after 
that the un resolution grants the right to use force against 
iraq 
bush announced bakers trip to iraq and invited iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz to washington to meet with the president 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said today that 
plans are going ahead to arrange the meetings although the united 
states still does not have an official reply from iraq about 
whether it accepts the proposal 
nonetheless preliminary informal talks are under way to 
discuss scheduling ms tutwiler said negotiators have agreed that 
any talks will be bilateral discussions between the united states 
and iraq without the participation of other us allies 
as he left washington sunday evening for south america bush 
declined to respond directly to reporters questions about details 
of pending talks im very pleased with the way its going but 
well see was his only response

trouble with the 150 million astro 
observatory today delayed columbia astronauts scientific research 
and as the hours ticked by scientists said some planned 
observations would not be made 
theres a definite loss as we go said mission scientist ted 
gull some objects are just going to slip off the list 
despite hours of efforts that stretched into early afternoon 
nasa officials had trouble calibrating the observatorys instrument 
pointing system which affects all three ultraviolet telescopes 
another problem involving a computer that controls the movements 
of one telescope was solved however 
mission manager jack jones said another star tracker on board 
attached to one of the telescopes will be used to point the 
telescopes if the main pointing system continues to malfunction 
the instrument is more awkward to operate however since it is 
desigened for another purpose 
whichever one of these we demonstrate can work first our plan 
is to immediately go into that mode of operation and start 
gathering science he said 
the astro had been expected to look at about 250 highenergy 
objects including stars quasars galaxies jupiter a supernova 
and comet levy the ultraviolet light and xrays emitted from these 
objects cannot be seen by groundbased instruments because they are 
unable to penetrate the earths atmosphere because at least half a 
day of work has now been lost that number will be trimmed 
officials said 
sure were disappointed but we knew this was a crucial step 
and might go slower than we planned said arthur code a 
university of wisconsin scientist who helped design one of the 
telescopes 
columbia blasted into orbit early sunday on a mission that was 
originally scheduled to fly in 1986 but was postponed by the 
challenger explosion hydrogen leaks forced three launch delays 
earlier this year and a telescope problem halted a fourth 
countdown 
columbias crew finally in orbit after a sixmonth delay spent 
most of the day sunday testing the hhree ultraviolet telescopes 
that will be aimed at quasars stars and other highenergy objects 
during the 10day mission 
although the astronauts hoped to make their first scientific 
observations today nasa ground controllers first had to fix the 
instrument pointing system the main problem was that the star 
trackers were oversensitive to light 
university of wisconsin scientists and engineers meanwhile 
activated a spare onboard computer that controls the movements of 
the schools ultraviolet telescope and the computer was working 
well the primary experiment computer crashed sunday while software 
was being loaded 
the mission is the first shuttle flight in five years dedicated 
solely to scientific research columbias flight also is the third 
mission in as many months a pace the shuttle program has not 
achieved since 1985 
we were so used to not getting it off the idea that its 
actually been launched and its up there orbiting the earth is 
amazing said arthur davidsen of johns hopkins university 
principal investigator for one of the telescopes 
the brilliant night liftoff also was a boost to nasa which has 
endured a year of problems with leaky shuttles and the flawed 
hubble space telescope 
it sure goes a long way to erase the disappointments we had 
this summer launch director bob sieck said 
during the mission the sevenmember crew is working in shifts 
so the observatory can be manned continuously an xray telescope 
is being operated by computer commands relayed from goddard space 
flight center in greenbelt md 
using one of the ultraviolet telescopes during a test sunday 
night the crew focused on the first light a star called beta 
doradus that was selected for testing purposes not scientific 
observation 
that is a real star folks astronaut samuel durrance 
reported to scientists at marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala 
scientists will use the observatory to measure ultraviolet and 
xray radiation 
meanwhile a computer terminal in the flight deck was turned off 
sunday after columbia commander vance brand smelled something 
burning it was believed to have overheated 
also on sunday a soviet rocket blasted into space with two 
cosmonauts and a japanese journalist who will join two other men at 
space station mir that puts a total of 12 people in space the 
most at one time 
columbias astronauts hope to communicate with the soviet crew

the rebel leader who overthrew president 
hissene habre dissolved chads parliament and suspended the 
consitution a day after his victorious entry into the capital 
radio chad reported today 
idriss deby who has promised to establish a democratic 
government drove into the capital aboard a black mercedes on 
sunday habre having fled after a series of military debacles 
the announcement after a meeting of the executive committee of 
debys popular salvation movement denounced the economic moral 
and political chaos of the previous government the radio spoke 
of the fictive and inoperant character of the institutions 
being dissolved or suspended 
earlier in the day deby freed at least 450 libyan prisoners of 
war a libyan plane left ndjamena in late afternoon to ferry the 
thin and raggedlooking prisoners home 
libya fought a series of wars with habres government before 
being driven off chadian territory in 1987 
habre apparently fled to cameroon the official libyan news 
agency jana claimed sunday that habre had been killed but the 
state radio in cameroon chads western neighbor reported monday 
that habre and eight of his ministers had taken refuge in northern 
cameroon 
french government officials also said they had information that 
habre was alive 
deby 38 was habres chief aide in a 1982 coup but broke with 
him last year and formed a rebel movement habre claimed that libya 
funded debys rebellion but the libyans and deby denied it 
before dissolving the national assembly deby met with alingue 
bawayeu president of the body who acts as interim president 
according to the constitution adopted dec 10 1989 
members of the rebels patriotic salvation movement received 
other highranking officials of the deposed government 
sources close to the talks said deby hoped to calm fears of a 
purge and instill confidence in the future he has promised 
multiparty democracy 
rebels in allterrain vehicles mounted with machine guns zoomed 
through the city today spreading their control from key 
administrative buildings to workingclass neighborhoods 
after entering the capital deby said he wanted to end the civil 
strife that has ravaged chad for the past decade and declared that 
he would institute a democracy 
my worry is not to be president of the republic he said 
this country must become democratic pluralist the moment has 
come to lay down our arms 
earlier this year habre organized the countrys first contested 
election in its 30 years as an independent state but candidates 
were limited to independents and members of his ruling party he 
was reelected to a sevenyear term 
deby urged reconciliation with goukouni oueddei the president 
he and habre toppled in 1982 goukouni is exiled in libya 
three companies of foreign legion soldiers landed sunday in 
ndjamena to reinforce frances total troop strength in its former 
colony to 1800 men the capital was pillaged saturday after habre 
and his troops fled 
the legionnaires organized the evacuation of 948 foreigners to 
paris on two flights sunday most of the evacuees were french but 
about 50 american dependents were on the flights 
france has deployed soldiers in chad under a defense treaty 
they have taken no part in the fighting which paris views as a 
chadian affair 
on saturday the legionnaires organized the remaining chadian 
government troops to impose an overnight curfew and disarm looters 
mainly renegades or civilians who had picked up weapons thrown down 
by army deserters 
there were no immediate reports of deaths in the rebel takeover 
but the french relief agency doctors without borders said it 
treated 120 people hurt in rioting 
about 1000 civilians cheered deby as his mercedesled motorcade 
pulled into the place des martyrs the central square in the city 
of 400000 people others waved and cried out from the streets 
no details were disclosed but the talks were presumed to 
concern a handover of power in this north african country of about 
52 million people 
there were conflicting reports about the fate of habre and his 
cabinet 
the libyan news agency jana said he was killed near the sudanese 
border but diplomats and other sources said habre and his family 
flew in a military plane early saturday to maroua cameroon about 
185 miles west of ndjamena 
neither report could be independently verified 
libya which occupied twothirds of chad in 1980 and occupied 
parts of the north before being driven out in 1987 denied any 
involvement in debys offensive 
but jana called habre a brigand and hailed the victory of 
the rebels 
habre was an obstacle in the way of national reconciliation 
between chadians and an obstacle to good neighborliness and the 
bonds of history and common suffering between libyans and 
chadians jana said in the commentary 
deby a brilliant military tactician broke the morale of 
government troops in a threeweek campaign that culminated thursday 
when the rebels captured abeche a town of 30000 people about 500 
miles east of ndjamena

the federal government and oil 
producers have resolved an environmental dispute that had stalled 
production at part of a vast alaskan oilfield near prudhoe bay 
the army corps of engineers the main opponent of the project 
agreed friday to a plan in which arco bp exploration and exxon 
would spend an estimated 50 million in the drilling area to ease 
fish migration in the beaufort sea 
the agreement clears the way for production to begin within two 
years at the point mcintyre field where the oil companies own 
rights to an estimated 300 million barrels production from point 
mcintyre and the nearby lisburne field could reach 100000 barrels 
a day by 1994 said al greenstein a spokesman at arcos 
headquarters in los angeles 
our agreement recognizes that environmental quality and 
economic reality are both important in north slope oil and gas 
decisions said col william w kakel alaska district engineer 
for the corps 
officials from the energy department helped mediate the dispute 
in an effort to increase domestic oil output to help make up for 
the loss of 200000 barrels a day of kuwaiti oil following the aug 
2 iraqi invasion 
production had been delayed because of concerns that existing 
gravel causeways that extended from land into the beaufort sea 
threatened fish that migrate in the coastal waters of northern 
alaska the roadbeds were built for exploration drilling at the 
point mcintyre field and the nearby endicott field 
federal officials said the causeways appeared to raise salt 
concentrations and the water temperature to levels that could be 
harmful to the arctic char broad whitefish and other fish relied 
upon by commercial fishermen 
oil industry officials have said years of monitoring programs on 
the causeways did not indicate any adverse effects to the fish 
but they agreed to spend 50 million to clear several water 
passages in the gravel roadbeds the agreement calls for 650 
additional feet of openings in the prudhoe bay west dock and 
endicott gravel causeways 
the agreement enables oil companies to move ahead with 
production and avoids years of dispute and possible litigation 
said brian davies a vice president for development at bp 
the causeway work could take as long as five years said bp 
spokesman paul laird 
output at the lisburne field which is already in production is 
40000 barrels a day greenstein said the combined output from the 
lisburne and point mcintyre fields will exceed 60000 barrels a day 
when output from point mcintyre begins by late summer in 1992 and 
could 100000 barrels a day after a planned expansion in 1993 
about 13 million barrels a day are produced each day from 
prudhoe bay fields

record government spending pumped up the value 
of new construction projects 13 percent in october despite the 
smallest outflow for residential housing in 4 years the 
government said monday 
the private building side is still very weak and still 
declining said economist daryl delano of cahners economics in 
newton mass if not for government spending wed be talking 
about a very bleak picture 
the commerce department said overall residential 
nonresidential and government spending totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4344 billion up from 4289 billion in 
september construction spending was unchanged in august at 4412 
billion 
but 27 percent of the october total came from government funds 
a 77 percent increase from september to 1178 billion that 
broke a 1158 billion record set last august 
much of the increase was due to spending on sewer systems up 
155 percent schools up 57 percent and streets and highways up 
55 percent 
spending by the oftenvolatile government sector had fallen 55 
percent in september after gaining 71 percent the previous month 
but private spending continued its recent weakness 
residential construction dropped 09 percent to 1795 billion 
its seventh consecutive monthly decline and the lowest since 
spending totaled 1774 billion in march 1986 residential spending 
was off 25 percent in september 
at the same time spending on nonresidential construction slid 
08 percent to 1020 billion the smallest amount since 1000 
billion in new projects got under way last december 
overall spending in october was just 12 percent above the 
4293 billion posted in the same month last year 
delano attributed much of the recent weakness in the private 
sector to the socalled credit crunch which both federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady have said is causing problems for many businesses 
the credit problem is particularly acute in the private 
nonresidential sector where there is a lack of funding for 
projects even those projects that make reasonably good business 
sense delano said 
some critics contend government officials are being overzealous 
in interpreting banking regulations in the wake of the savings and 
loan debacle brady has asked regulators not to be 
unrealistically negative in evaluating loans and urged bankers 
to keep lending to your good customers 
singlefamily spending fell 20 percent to 1028 billion after 
a 31 percent drop in september despite a 10 percent increase to 
187 billion in apartment construction 
nonresidential spending slipped 08 percent to 1020 billion 
following a 15 percent decline in september 
residential spending has been down for many many months 
now delano said nonresidential just started turning down a 
couple of months ago our forecast for all of the nonresidential 
sectors shows weakness continuing into next year beyond the middle 
of next year its pretty grim

this is a golden time for speaker thomas s 
foley he has led his democrats from upheaval to unity has 
president bush courting on every issue and his side will enjoy a 
big 100vote majority beginning next month 
but what is his mandate 
the washington democrat became speaker last year after former 
speaker jim wright resigned in an ethics storm foleys soothing 
lowkey style was good medicine for the institution and built him a 
huge reservoir of good will 
given the mess he inherited he wasnt blamed for the slow pace 
of legislation last year or the sloppy way things were done this 
year and he won praise for what was accomplished in the end 
the 102nd congress however will be all his starting with his 
uncontested renomination by the democrats on monday 
speaker foley came during a difficult time and i think hes 
established a high level of confidence and trust i think he has 
strong bipartisan support and is an excellent speaker said rep 
dave mccurdy dokla 
i think the issue is how does he consolidate the gains he 
made mccurdy added 
in the last congress foley proved a patient negotiator with an 
extraordinary talent for nurturing consensus on issues ranging 
from flag burning where he outlasted demands for a constitutional 
amendment to the budget where he and the democrats stonewalled as 
bushs tax pledge crumbled he smartly waited for the consensus to 
move in his direction and won 
he seems to be utilizing those same skills as he fences with the 
white house over bushs middle east policy 
a protege of the late sen henry scoop jackson foley 
clearly understands that even if lawmakers doubt bush they cant 
let republicans trap them into appearing weak on defense issues 
his handling of the issue on behalf of the democrats could help set 
the tone for the new congress 
but the next congress will test not only whether foley can lead 
the democrats through the political mine fields hell be expected 
to put new ideas for the nations needs before his colleagues and 
the nation 
mccurdy and others say foley needs to develop legislative 
initiatives for the house that also will serve the party well in 
the 1992 presidential election 
so far foley has enunciated an agenda that only repeats his 
desire for some of the unfinished items from the last congress 
including campaign reform and civil rights legislation democratic 
leaders also intend to keep pushing the economic fairness issue 
they believe served the party well in the closing weeks of the last 
congress 
rep pat williams dmont a member of the democratic 
leadership expressed confidence foley will step out in front the 
speaker toughened politically he said when foleys initial budget 
deal with bush was defeated 
i think foley became a better poker player with the help of 
his democratic colleagues when they rejected the budget agreement 
they were dealt and asked for a new hand he said 
foleys position will be stronger also because of changes he can 
now make in the house leadership structure which he couldnt make 
midstream murky to the outside world they are nonetheless 
important 
new lawmakers will be beholden to him for their committee 
assignments the new democratic campaign chief is his pick and he 
gets to replace wright holdovers and appoint a big portion of the 
partys policymaking committee in the house 
foleys toughest challenge may be to temper his natural tendency 
to let issues come to him since theres no way to make sure the 
most vocal messagecarriers represent the partys best interests 
the leftwing screamers and the oneissue democrats need to 
let foley steer a mainstream course and to let foley be foley 
said mccurdy who promised he and other moderates would make sure 
they were in foleys face as often as the others were 
no one expects foley to change stripes to be anything but his 
cautious compromising intellectual self the real question is 
whether he will be expansive whether he will go beyond sorting 
through competing suggestions for curing the nations ills and 
develop them and push them to fruition 
with world and domestic events moving so quickly hell start 
providing answers soon after the new congress begins on jan 3

former east german leader erich honecker insists 
he is not guilty of charges that he issued shoottokill orders at 
the berlin wall his lawyer said monday 
for the third straight day soviet officials blocked the arrest 
of honecker who has taken refuge at a soviet military hospital in 
the woods south of berlin soviet doctors believe he is seriously 
ill an interpreter said 
berlin justice officials issued an arrest warrant friday two 
days before a united germany held its first free elections in 58 
years they said they based the warrant on new documents recently 
uncovered that incriminate honecker 
honecker faces charges that he signed shoottokill orders at 
the berlin wall the border between former east and west germany 
but german police cannot arrest honecker without soviet 
permission to enter the hospital which is guarded by armed 
soldiers the soviets have indicated they are holding their former 
ally on humanitarian grounds 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin told a news 
conference nobody knows what will happen with honecker and how 
the situation will be resolved 
the decision to get mr honecker to a soviet hospital had to 
do with his state of health and we would like to believe that the 
german side will also be guided first of all by principles of 
humanism churkin said 
the warrant specifically links honecker to the deaths of four 
people killed while trying to flee his repressive regime before it 
was toppled in last years peaceful revolution about 200 people 
died trying to escape from east germany during the 28year 
existence of the berlin wall 
wolfgang ziegler one of honeckers defense lawyers told the 
adn news agency that his client insisted he was not guilty 
the agency said ziegler had lodged a protest against the arrest 
warrant on grounds that honecker cannot be punished for alleged 
crimes committed under east german laws the east german legal 
system ceased to exist when the former communist state acceded to 
west germany on oct 3 and west german laws took effect 
honecker 78 was transferred earlier monday to a cardiology 
unit at the soviet military hospital in beelitz 20 miles south of 
berlin he took refuge there in april 
adn quoted a soviet interpreter as saying red army doctors 
considered honeckers condition serious one doctor diagnosed 
honecker as having high blood pressure the agency quoted igor 
molotkin the interpreter as saying 
honeckers lawyers maintain that he is too sick to stand trial 
german justice officials say they have no way of verifying 
honeckers state of health until the soviets let them into the 
hospital 
an official at the soviet embassy in bonn on monday refused to 
comment on a report that talks were under way between german and 
soviet officials on handing over honecker whose testimony could be 
potentially damaging to moscow 
honecker in coments published in november by the european a 
british weekly newspaper complained that he was brought down from 
power by intriguers 
later the same month he said he was toppled on oct 18 1989 
because of a soviet conspiracy according to a report published in 
the berlin wochenpost weekly newspaper 
the soviet union and the other three victorious world war ii 
powers relinquished special rights over the two german states in 
agreements that restored german sovereignty 
but the oct 12 germansoviet agreement on the withdrawal of red 
army forces stationed in eastern germany assures the soviets 
control of their military bases

the publisher of consumer reports is urging the 
food and drug administration to halt the sale of milk from cows 
being treated with a genetically engineered growth hormone 
critics have repeatedly raised questions about possible health 
risks associated with milk containing the hormone but the fda and 
many others have argued that bovine growth hormone as its called 
has no effect on human health 
the hormone is given to cows to boost milk production some 
critics have argued that it could have a harmful economic effect by 
boosting milk production at a time when there is no shortage of 
milk 
it has not yet been approved by the fda but in 1985 the agency 
ruled that milk from cows treated with the hormone could be sold 
consumers union which publishes the magazine called on the fda 
to reopen its investigation of the human safety of the hormone 
while it pursues its review of the hormones effects on animal 
health 
we see virtually no benefits to the average consumer from the 
use of this drug michael k hansen the reports author said 
its use is unlikely to result in lower milk prices to consumers 
in fact its use may cost consumers tax dollars that the federal 
government must spend to buy up dairy surpluses 
four companies produce growth hormone american cyanamid eli 
lilly monsanto and upjohn 
in august the fda released a review of more than 120 studies to 
support its contention that the hormone is safe for human 
consumption a week earlier an article in the journal of the 
american medical association also found the hormone to be safe 
yet critics have continued to raise questions 
last week jeremy rifkin one of the most outspoken critics 
sued the national dairy board for what he said was illegal 
promotion of the hormone before it has been approved by the fda 
he also petitioned the agency to immediately halt any 
promotion of this product by fda officials and to immediately 
rescind the use of this product in the marketplace until it is 
approved 
on monday he filed another petition asking the agency to halt 
sales recall milk produced by hormonetreated cows and establish a 
longterm independent research program on the hormones safety 
william grigg and fda spokesman said the agency has determined 
that the hormone is not active in humans and occurs normally in 
milk in amounts comparable to those found in milk from treated 
cows

the supreme court said monday it will decide 
whether police who have an owners permission to search a car must 
get a court warrant before opening any containers inside the 
vehicle 
the justices agreed to review a florida supreme court ruling 
that court warrants are needed before police open containers found 
in the cars interior other than in the trunk 
in a 1982 decision the nations highest court ruled that police 
can search even closed containers within a cars trunk any time an 
officer has reasonable cause to believe the car contains drugs 
weapons or other contraband 
no warrant is needed for such searches of containers found in 
the trunk the court said in 1982 
the justices now must decide probably by july whether that 
ruling applies to consentual searches conducted inside that part of 
the car where the driver and passengers sit the florida court said 
the 1982 ruling did not apply 
the state courts ruling barred prosecutors from using as trial 
evidence cocaine found by a miami policeman in a car owned by enio 
and luz jimeno during a 1989 search 
officer frank trujillo became suspicious of the car driven by 
enio jimeno and followed it until it made an illegal turn trujillo 
then stopped the car and asked to search the inside for drugs 
jimeno consented and trujillos search turned up a brown paper 
bag on the floor on the front passenger side 
trujillo did not ask for permission to open the bag before doing 
so and found cocaine inside 
a state trial judge granted the jimenos request to exclude the 
cocaine as evidence against them and the florida supreme court 
upheld that ruling 
attorney general robert butterworth then appealed contending 
that police authority to conduct warrantless car searches when 
given consent is just as broad as a search based on warrant or 
probable cause 
lawyers for the jimenos had urged the justices to reject 
butterworths appeal 
the case is florida vs jimeno 90622

a california community college accused of 
unlawful censorship for blocking the oncampus performance of a 
racially charged play lost a supreme court appeal monday 
the justices without comment rejected arguments by the college 
officials that the lawsuit should be killed 
the case raises the question of whether college administrators 
have the same broad power as public high school officials to limit 
freedom of speech in schoolsponsored activities 
the california dispute began in june 1986 when alan dibona a 
drama teacher at san diego commmunity college planned a class 
production of split second 
the play is about a black new york city police officer who 
fatally shoots a white suspect after the suspect has taunted him 
with racial slurs and epithets the officer following his 
splitsecond loss of control places a knife in the victims hand 
to make the shooting look like selfdefense 
dibona planned to have the play performed at the educational 
cultural complex a branch of the san diego college students 
auditioning for parts in the play were to receive course credit 
robert matthews president of the branch college and james 
hardison dean of arts and sciences there opposed the performance 
they said community church leaders who learned about the planned 
performance were upset the college officials also expressed 
concern over profane language used in the play saying it could 
inflame racial tensions already sparked by a local murder case in 
which a young black man was accused of shooting two police 
officers 
when dibona refused to change his plans the college cancelled 
his class 
he and his students performed split second off campus none 
of the students received course credit for the performance and 
dibona was not paid by the college 
dibona and a student scott gundlach sued matthews and hardison 
for allegedly violating their freespeech rights 
a judge threw out the suit but it was reinstated in july by a 
state appeals court which ordered a trial 
the appeals court noted that the supreme court in 1988 upheld 
the power of a high school principal to remove two controversial 
articles from a student newspaper 
but college students are adults the appeals court said adding 
where children are concerned the legitimate role of the 
government in regulating speech is substantially broader

the leader of the south african communist party joe slovo said 
monday that if president fw de klerk did not act to stop the 
violence talks between the government and anc could be ruined he 
accused government security forces of instigating the unrest to 
disrupt the talks

a female psychiatrist alleged monday that 
national health officials criticized in the past for not including 
more women in government studies are now discriminating against 
women researchers 
dr margaret jensvold a former medical staff fellow at the 
national institute of mental health filed a federal lawsuit 
contending that a male superior harassed her because she was female 
and fired her in 1989 before she could complete the third year of a 
fellowship program 
the suit filed in us district court in maryland also alleged 
that jensvold was denied opportunities for research and writing 
provided to male medical fellows and that a male superior tried to 
destroy her academic career 
a spokeswoman for nimh said officials had not seen the suit and 
would have no immediate comment 
the suit said that when jensvold worked in the menstrually 
related mood disorder clinic at nimh she was the only woman 
physician in the program set up to study premenstrual syndrome 
i was never accepted by the male physicians who were in charge 
of my program jensvold said in a statement 
she said male physicians constantly denigrated women who had 
preceded her saying they did not deserve any credit for work they 
had done and that they had been pushed out because they could not 
get along with male colleagues 
earlier this year a study by the general accounting office 
congress investigative arm found that the national institutes of 
health has had little success with its fouryear effort to include 
more women in government research of diseases and their treatments 
nih and nimh have recently come under serious criticism for 
failing to includ women as research subjects jensvold said 
now it is clear that they are also excluding women as 
researchers the effect of these two things on womens health is 
very destructive 
the lawsuit named as defendant louis sullivan secretary of the 
department of health and human services it seeks to have jensvold 
reinstated as a thirdyear medical fellow and awarded back pay 
benefits and other damages of at least 100000

as president bush on monday was telling 
south americans to push for free trade and open up their economies 
hundreds of us journalists covered him using equipment that 
technically could have been seized by brazils federal police 
a special press room set up here by the us embassy was a 
glaring contrast to the restrictions barriers and bureaucracy that 
inhibit the use of uptodate conveniences in brazil and much of 
south america 
american reporters wrote their bush stories on lightweight 
laptop computers they filed them on portable fax machines or over 
highspeed data channels using special telephone lines connected 
directly to the united states american broadcast networks thanks 
to a huge imported dish antenna set up in the hotel parking lot 
beamed reports directly to us satellites 
brazil obviously made a special exception for the washington 
press but under normal circumstances here computers and faxes and 
highspeed communications equipment are on a list of totally 
prohibited imports 
the idea behind the law was to prevent foreign imperialists 
from controlling brazils sophisticated technology many other 
south american countries have similar restrictions to protect their 
hightech industries 
brazil it is true today has a 6 billionayear market in 
computers and related equipment and brazilians who a decade ago 
knew nothing about this field now in fact turn out sophisticated 
machinery 
but brazilianmade computer components always seem to be a step 
behind the state of the art in the united states japan and 
europe and brazilian hightech equipment costs an outrageous 
fortune 
a year ago a brazilian fax cost 8000 now you might find one 
on special for 1500 but most remain in the 25003000 range 
in the united states they cost less than 500 
a 14inch color monitor for a home computer made in brazil and 
thus for sale legally costs 2800 the us price is 650 
brazils topoftheline laser printer costs 20000 a us 
model with the same features sells for 3500 
equals 
president bushs team of senior advisers all passed up the 
opportunity to travel with him on his fivenation south american 
trip so did his wife barbara complaining of a sinus infection 
aggravated b flying around on planes 
secretary of state james a baker iii stayed behind to testify 
before congress on the persian gulf crisis john sununu the white 
house chief of staff and brent scowcroft the presidents national 
security adviser also remained at home and sent deputies in their 
place 
there was no official explanation for the absence of sununu and 
scowcroft one senior official though suggested that some of 
bushs advisers are becoming exhausted by his near nonstop travel 
which in recent days has included treks through europe the middle 
east and mexico 
equals 
tropical brazil is not known as great wine country the little 
wine that it produces is mostly grown and drunk by ethnic italians 
in southern brazil other wines are exported to europe for mixture 
in popular lowpriced brands there 
bush avoided the brazilian grape when he threw a luncheon for 
business leaders instead he reached 4300 miles back to virginia 
to serve wines from meredyth vineyards a seyval blanc 89 and 
vallard noir 85 
the rest of the menu shrimp and avocado en beurre blanc

the typical american familys ability to buy 
an existing home increased in october to its highest level in more 
than two years a real estate trade group said monday 
but despite falling home prices lower mortgage interest rates 
and rising family incomes existing home sales fell 47 percent in 
october according the national association of realtors 
the missing link is consumer confidence the housing 
affordability index indicates that conditions are better than 
theyve been in over two years said realtors president harley e 
rouda 
the realtors group said its housing affordability index rose to 
1134 in october from 1108 the previous month that meant a family 
with a median income of 35353 had 1134 percent of the income 
needed to qualify for conventional financing to buy a medianpriced 
home costing 92800 
the median is the point at which half of the families earned 
more and half earned less and half of the homes cost more and half 
less the median income rose 114 in october while the median price 
fell 1600 the monthly mortgage payment for the medianpriced 
home decreased 14 to 649 
the index was at its highest point since it reached 1135 in 
september 1988 
buying conditions varied according to region said john a 
tuccillo the realtors chief economist in the northeast and the 
west for instance the typical family lacked the income necessary 
to buy the medianpriced home 
in the northeast a family earning the median income of 41376 
had 901 percent of the income needed to buy a medianpriced home 
costing 136200 in the west a family with a median income of 
37631 had 808 percent of the income needed to buy a 
medianpriced home costing 140600 
families generally had more income than necessary to buy homes 
in the midwest and south where housing typically is lowerpriced 
in the midwest a family earning 36127 had 1479 percent of 
the income needed to buy a 72100 home while a family living in 
the south earning 31795 had 1127 percent of the income needed to 
buy an 83400 home 
also affecting the affordability index was a drop in the 
interest rate from 10 percent in september to 996 percent in 
october the rate is a composite of closing rates for both 
fixedrate and adjustablerate mortgages on existing homes as 
reported by the federal housing finance board 
when the index measures 100 the median family income equals 
exactly the amount needed to purchase a medianpriced home using 
conventional financing and making a 20 percent down payment

as the us defense secretary sparred monday with the chairman 
of the senate armed service committee over how best to drive iraq 
from kuwait iraq insisted a palestinian homeland was the issue to 
be decided first 
president bush meanwhile departed from a prepared text to 
assail saddam hussein 
i realize the sacrifces that saddam husseins brutality has 
caused this nation bush told lawmakers in brazil on monday he 
estimated high oil prices resulting from the persian gulf crisis 
are costing brazil 5 billion annually a figure local experts 
said seemed excessive 
bush after winning un authorization last week for a military 
strike against iraq unless it quits kuwait by jan 15 offered to 
send his secretary of state to baghdad to negotiate 
iraq agreed to talk but monday iraq again insisted the 
palestinian people must have a homeland in the west bank and gaza 
with jerusalem as its capital before any other middle east peace 
questions can be dealt with 
the first question is palestine iraqi delegate adnan malik 
told the un general assembly palestine comes first palestine 
comes second and palestine comes third 
the united states has rejected any linkage of the palestine 
issue to iraqs withdrawal from kuwait israel has occupied the 
west bank and gaza strip since seizing control of the territories 
in the 1967 middle east war 
defense secretary dick cheney told the senate committee on 
monday the administration was pessimistic about economic sanctions 
bringing an end to iraqs 4monthold occupation of kuwait 
given the nature of the regime given saddam husseins 
brutality to his own people his very tight control of that 
society his ability to allocate resources for the military their 
ability to produce their own food he can ride them out 
cheney said 
it is far better for us to deal with him now than it will 
be for us to deal with him five or 10 years from now when 
saddam has become an even better armed and more threatening 
regional superpower than he is at present the defense secretary 
said 
he said he saw no indication saddam was willing to settle the 
dispute 
armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga questioned 
the bush administrations attitude toward economic sanctions 
if we have a war were never going to know whether they would 
have worked would we he asked cheney 
thats the major point here the way you find out if sanctions 
are going to work is to give them enough time to work nunn said 
in saudi arabia some us forces reportedly were on heightened 
alert some troops donned gas masks and protective gloves against a 
possible chemical weapons strike at the same time iraq testfired 
missiles on sunday a correspondent with the nbc radio network 
said 
the heightened alert reportedly went into effect early thursday 
and was the highest alert since iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 but 
it was not a war alert us military officers said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
iraq testfired soviettype scud missiles which could be used 
to carry chemical weapons on sunday the us military said the 
military said the flight path was away from the usled 
multinational force in eastern saudi arabia 
a jetliner carrying boxing great muhammad ali and some former 
american and canadian hostages returned to the jordanian capital 
monday shortly after taking off for new york the plane turned 
around because of minor technical problems but resumed its flight 
about seven hours later officials said 
also monday the british foreign office reported iraq has 
detained four more british men who had been in hiding in kuwait 
the foreign office said there were 440 britons hiding in kuwait and 
an estimated 740 britons in iraq 
saddam has prevented many foreigners from leaving both countries 
and says he will use detained westerners as human shields 
against attack from the multinational force massed in the gulf he 
has been freeing the hostages affew at a time 
in other developments 
oil industry sources said war in the gulf would cause 
production engineers to flee causing saudi oil production to 
plummet by as much as 2 million barrels a day the sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said the united states would make 
up the shortfall from its strategic petroleum reserves 
analysts have said the price of crude oil which has fluctuated 
widely since iraq seized kuwait could top 65 a barrel in the 
event of war 
a small fire bomb exploded and another device was dismantled 
monday on dutch rail lines used to transport us military 
equipment bound for the gulf police said dutch opponents of the 
military buildup in the gulf reportedly claimed responsibility 
the explosion set fire to trackside electric installations 
outside boxtel the netherlands causing delays in service police 
said no one was injured and there were no us military trains in 
the area at the time explosives experts later found a similar 
device at boxtel rail station again disrupting rail service

an american brain drain is in the making 
because of a poor atmosphere for creative technology and an 
aggressive engineer recruiting program by foreign companies a nasa 
advisory committee was told monday 
our members are asking themselves what future is there for the 
american aerospace worker leonard ricks testified 
unfortunately many of our colleagues are concluding that there 
is no future and are leaving 
he spoke at the sixth and last hearing of the advisory committee 
on the future of the us space program which is preparing to 
issue a final report on dec 17 the committee was set up in july 
by nasa administrator richard truly 
ricks executive director for the council of engineers and 
scientists organizations said american engineering journals now 
contain ads by foreign countries who will steal american 
technology by importing its creator 
he said public policy has focused on the management of the 
nations space program but not the creators of technology and said 
focus on nasas problems has created a witchhunt atmosphere 
today there is a feeding frenzy over many of the technical 
difficulties that naturally occur in any complex scientific 
endeavor he said both the print and electronic media have 
appeared jubilant over flaws in the hubble space telescope 
mirror fuel leaks and other technical problems 
that in turn has produced an enormous morale problem in the 
aerospace workforce said ricks whose organization represents more 
than 100000 engineers 
we are increasingly made to feel embarrassed by public policy 
makers who see our programs as wasting money that could be spent in 
meeting social needs we are humiliated by the medias presentation 
of our products as inferior and flawed 
americas space program he said is best characterized by the 
word instability and cannot be otherwise without longterm 
commitment 
we need to think about the workforce of tomorrow ricks 
said are we to condemn our young people to a future of 
employment in fast food chains if so they do not need an 
education to operate the foreign made computers that show the 
pictures of burgers fries and milkshakes eliminating the need for 
employees who read

negotiations to complete an 
unprecedented global free trade pact opened in turmoil on monday 
delegates inside the hall clashed on farm issues while police 
outside battled angry demonstrators 
almost 30000 farmers marched through the cobblestoned streets 
of this european capital to protest a usbacked proposal aimed at 
trimming billions of dollars in tradedistorting agricultural 
subsidies 
at one point police used tear gas and water cannon when 
demonstrators tried to storm the european parliament building 
organizers hoped the protest would send a blunt message to 
delegates who have gathered for the concluding session of a 
fouryear effort to overhaul the world trading system 
the talks are known as the uruguay round for the nation where 
they began in 1986 they involve 107 member nations in an effort to 
rewrite the constitution of world trade a document known as the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
the united states hoping to reduce trade deficits still running 
at close to 100 billion is aggressively pushing a package of 
proposals aimed at expanding export opportunities for american 
farmers and businesses 
in addition to trimming farm subsidies the us agenda included 
efforts to crack down on the piracy of us products estimated to 
cost american businesses 60 billion annually and to expand gatt 
rules to cover the fastgrowing service industries such as banking 
and insurance 
but officials of the 12nation european community noting the 
number of protesters maintained that adoption of the us farm 
proposal would represent political suicide they insisted that they 
had no latitude to go beyond an offer for a 30 percent cut in 
internal farm supports 
the only flexibility i have is in explaining in detail the 
impact which the reduction in internal supports will have said 
ray macsharry the european communitys agriculture chief 
us trade representative carla hills told delegates in an 
opening speech that the ec proposal was totally inadequate the 
united states is demanding 90 percent cuts in export subsidies 
used as incentives to promote overseas sales and 75 percent 
reductions in internal supports and market barriers 
only one thing stands between us and the triggering of a 
worldwide economic renaissance the stalemate over agriculture 
she said 
the united states believes that without a commitment to reduce 
farm subsidies third world countries will walk away from the 
negotiations dooming any chances to get new trade rules to cover 
service industries and copyright theft 
negotiators went into closeddoor sessions late monday on the 
farm issue but with time running short there was growing concern 
that the talks could well end in failure 
the only hopeful sign on monday came in negotiations over 
efforts to draft rules covering financial services such as 
banking canada japan sweden and switzerland introduced a 
proposal that us negotiators said could represent a breakthrough 
in this area 
however officials of third world nations did not rush to 
embrace the measure their support is considered crucial since 
banks from america and other devoped countries see the third world 
as the primary area for expansion opportunities 
many delegates from third world countries complained that their 
needs were being ignored by the wealthy nations they maintained 
that no overall gatt agreement was possible without an end to the 
costly farm subsidy battle which steals potential markets from 
their farmers 
when i talk about agriculture i am talking about human 
decency itself said amaret silaon minister of commerce for 
thailand i am talking about 30 million human beings in my 
country whose lives have been in abject poverty generation after 
generation significantly as a result of agricultural practices and 
polices of some countries in the developed world 
pakistani commerce minister malik muhammad naaem khan said his 
country was disappointed not only by the lack of movement in 
agriculture but also by a failure to reach agreement to lower 
barriers in textile trade another item high on the agenda of third 
world nations 
we have borne the burden of these restraints he said the 
uruguay round is our hope 
but farmers particularly the 10 million in the european 
community viewed the trade talks as a threat to their livelihoods 
we are all small farmers we would have to leave the land 
said irish farmer michael murphy one of those taking part in the 
demonstrations

here is a list of the most contentious issues to 
be resolved at the trade talks in brussels 
agriculture the linchpin of the talks declared aim 
substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and 
protection over a sustained period of time the united states 
wants cuts of 75 percent in internal supports and import barriers 
and 90 percent in export subsidies over ten years the 12nation 
european community has offered a 30 percent cut in internal 
supports by 1995 no negotiating text has been sent to brussels 
services aim is to set up a general agreement on trade in 
services to liberalize trade in the 680 billion sector just as 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade has opened markets in 
goods the united states wants a new agreement to allow the 
continuation of bilateral accords most others say benefits granted 
to one country must apply to all countries the negotiating text is 
littered with brackets and an annex on financial services is left 
blank 
market access aim is to reduce overall import tariffs by at 
least one third many countries have been slow in making offers 
leading to us threats to withdraw some cuts it has proposed 
washington offered cuts averaging 43 percent leaving high tariffs 
on textiles and other sensitive products the ec proposed flatrate 
cuts excluding agricultural products the text is awaiting the 
outcome of bilateral talks many negotiators say the issue is as 
difficult as agriculture and services 
antidumping aim is to revise the existing gatt antidumping 
code which authorizes duties against dumping goods on world 
markets at artificially low prices japan and southeast asian 
countries want tighter restrictions to prevent the west from using 
such duties merely to protect inefficient industries the west 
wants new measures against the evasion of duties there is no 
agreed negotiating text 
trade related investment measures aim is to draw up rules on 
measures that governments apply to investors such as the insistence 
on use of local materials the united states considers that all 
such measures distort trade and should be controlled or banned the 
third world says they are part of national development policies and 
should not be regulated by gatt there is no agreed negotiating 
text 
subsidies aim is to draw up rules governing both state aids 
to industry and measures to counter exports subsidized in this 
manner washington wants tough rules against subsidies countries 
such as canada and southeast asian nations say there should be more 
restrictions on counterveiling duties 90 percent of which are 
imposed by the united states the chairman of the group has drafted 
a text but the it has not been officially accepted 
trade related aspects of intellectual property rights aim is 
to agree on new rules on copyright trademarks patents etc there 
are divisions among industrialized nations on patent standards 
talks also are marked by a northsouth split on whether 
pharmaceutical products should be exempt from patent rules to 
enable continued cheap access for the third world there is no 
agreement on how any new rules should be enforced 
textiles aim is to phase out the 16yearold international 
multifiber arrangement which restricts exports through bilateral 
agreements and bring it within gatt rules there are differences 
between third world exporters which want swift liberalization and 
industrialized countries with their own textile industries 
outstanding issues include the scope of products to be covered the 
length of any phaseout and whether or not to implement safeguard 
measures against a sudden surge of imports during the transition

new york and california legislators went 
back to work monday each facing 1 billion in politically unpopular 
spending cuts 
new yorks democratic gov mario cuomo proposed the cuts to 
avoid a projected 1 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year 
ending march 31 
california gov george deukmejian a republican leaving office 
in january says his cuts would allow the nations largest state to 
finish its fiscal year june 30 with a balanced budget or just a 
small deficit 
cuomo has recommended state worker layoffs mandatory and unpaid 
employee furloughs and cuts in state spending on education and 
health care but he proposed no new taxes and has said that this 
deficit unlike ones in the past would not be wiped out by raiding 
reserve funds and borrowing 
its the third consecutive year of budget deficits in new york 
and next year appears no better state comptroller edward regan has 
predicted a potential 3 billion deficit for the new fiscal year 
cuomo has said that cutting back spending was the only way to 
solve new yorks persistent fiscal problems 
i frankly dont believe there are a whole lot of other 
alternatives cuomo has said there is no painless way out of 
this recession 
legislative leaders had been indicating they might be willing to 
leave cuomos proposals largely intact but as rankandfile 
legislators returned monday there were rumblings that negotiations 
had stalled over the weekend 
lets put it this way were not at impasse said geoffrey 
taylor spokesman for democratic assembly speaker mel miller 
lawmakers who recessed in midsummer were meeting privately 
monday and a vote was not expected until tuesday at the earliest 
in california deukmejians plan would cut 600 million in 
public school funding and 200 million from an income tax credit 
for renters as well as freeze state hiring and purchases in a 75 
billion budget deukmejian says his budget cuts would give 
california a cushion against worsening tax revenues 
deukmejian said he would like california legislators to approve 
his plan before he leaves office in january many legislators 
particularly majority democrats would rather wait until republican 
govelect pete wilson takes office jan 7 
new york and california have suffered sharp declines in tax 
revenues and cuomo has blamed his states problems on a struggling 
national economy 
california had a 13 billion reserve that deukmejian expects to 
be depleted by the end of the budget year new york has no such 
reserve and the cuomo administration has been trying to slow down 
spending for months

don vig left his land to the north 
dakotan frost and tom britbachs nephews are tending his cattle in 
montana on monday the two joined about 30000 fellow farmers from 
around the world in protest 
smallfarm owners say a usbacked proposal under consideration 
at trade talks here aimed at trimming billions of dollars in 
agricultural subsidies could cost them their livelihood 
the american farmers said they found that european and asian 
family farmers have the same fears they do they worry that small 
farms will disappear leaving only big agriculture conglomerates 
concerned with the bottom line 
we will not sacrifice the lives and livelihoods of japanese 
farmers for the grain traders and other multinational 
corporations said mitsugu horiuchi chairman of the zenchu farm 
lobby which represents 5 million japanese smallfamily farmers 
even if we are an ocean apart we share the same values 
said vig 39 who grows wheat and barley on his 1400acre farm in 
valley city nd we are all fighting for a fair return on our 
costs 
vig says he cannot make enough of a profit to replace his aging 
equipment 
britbachs farm in circle mont was tended by his father and 
his father before him but he says he wonders if family farmers 
have a chance 
the big companies will eventually have absolute control 
said britbach 62 
about 400000 american rural families gave up farming between 
1985 and 1989 alone said randolph nodland president of the 
national family farm coalition 
proponents of industrial agriculture say that bigger farm 
operations are more efficient and competitive in global markets 
farm issues including subsidies are the main point of

the state department reacted cautiously monday 
to the overthrow of the chadian government by a rebel leader us 
officials say is supplied by libya 
the embassy is instructed to conduct normal contacts and 
monitor the situation closely to determine whether a new regime has 
effective control over the country department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said 
she said that us ambassador richard bogosian would met with 
rebel leader idriss deby to find out what his policies are and 
discuss future uschadian relations 
it appears that the forces of mr deby are in effective 
control of the chadian capital of ndjamena she said 
asked if the united states would recognize the deby government 
she responded the issue of recognition is deemphasized until 
after a thorough diplomatic review 
tutwiler repeated the us position that deby 38 a former 
military aide to ousted president hissene habre was funded by 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
i can tell you that the united states stands by the statement 
of last week she said the department said then that debys 
forces are armed and supplied by libya 
officials said then that debys attacks on habre represent the 
latest example of libyas ongoing efforts to destabilize legitimate 
governments 
deby has promised to rule democratically one of his first acts 
in power was to free some 400 libyan prisoners in chad 
libya fought a series of wars with habres government before 
being driven off chadian territory in 1987

one day after triumphing in allgerman 
elections chancellor helmut kohl on monday began talks with 
coalition allies on forming a new government and prepared to tackle 
enormous problems facing the new germany 
his centerright coalition swept to victory in sundays 
parliamentary balloting the first in a united germany since 1932 
but kohl had little time to bask in the glory 
on monday the chancellor began talks with his christian 
democratic unions current governing partners their bavarian 
sister party the christian social union and the centrist free 
democrats 
he was hit by an ultimatum from the free democrats which made 
more gains in the elections than any other party they said they 
would reenter the coalition only if kohl agreed that companies in 
former east germany should pay lower taxes than those in former 
west germany 
no lowtax area no vote for the chancellor said otto 
lambsdorff chairman of the free democrats arguing that would be 
an important move toward encouraging badly needed investment in 
eastern germany 
kohl has said he opposes such a move contending it is 
unnecessary on monday he refused to discuss the issue in public 
and suggested his coalition partners do the same 
i am of the old school that believes in talking first and 
going public later kohl said 
he also said he would not be put under time pressure by 
anyone in forming a new cabinet he said he couldnt promise the 
coalition negotiations would be concluded before christmas 
kohls day began with an announcement from economics minister 
helmut haussmann who said he was quitting the cabinet amid what 
german television claimed was growing criticism over his handling 
of the economy 
haussmann was a major force in putting together the economic and 
monetary union of west and east germany in july a crucial step 
toward full unification on oct 3 he gave no reason for quitting 
later the head of germanys poerful central bank slammed 
kohls plans to borrow 100 billion next year to finance 
unification 
in an interview with stern magazine karl otto poehl said the 
proposed sum was too high and demanded instead greater spending 
cuts 
later kohls christian democrats met to discuss coalition 
negotiations and the vast problems the new government must tackle 
at a press conference kohl counted off some of those issues he 
said important decisions needed to be made on ways to slash 
government spending and raise further revenues to rebuild eastern 
germany 
the chancellor has insisted he will not increase taxes to come 
up with extra revenues for the massive reconstruction job but he 
has not disclosed just where the money will come from 
kohl could run up against opposition from his coalition partners 
over such issues 
the chancellor also said his government faces the huge task of 
cleaning up former east germany which has severe pollution 
problems 
the legacy of east germanys deposed communist government 
is especially grave in this area kohl said 
germany will also have to take on new global responsibilities 
that befit what is seen as its growing political and economic 
stature on the world stage kohl said 
but he indicated germany will not likely be able to quickly make 
the constitutional changes necessary to allow the deployment of 
german troops in the persian gulf or elsewhere outside nato areas 
we will discuss this within the coalition and with the 
opposition social democrats he said 
many social democrats oppose constitutional changes 
kohl came under sharp international criticism in august when he 
declined to send german troops to the gulf but under germanys 
constitution german troops cannot be deployed in nonnato areas 
kohl has since said he favors the appropriate constitutional 
amendment 
the big losers in sundays elections were the social democrats 
the main opposition party and the greens both leftist parties 
had criticized kohls swift pace of unification and accused his 
christian democrats of underplaying the cost of bringing the east 
up to the standard of the west 
the social democrats gained 13 parliamentary seats finishing 
with 239 
western germanys greens europes mostestablished ecology 
movement were voted out of parliament their sister branch in 
former east germany snared only eight seats 
kohls christiahristian social union alliance 
increased its strength from 305 to 313 seats in the 656member 
n democrat and cparliament 
however they failed to attain the absolute majority that would 
have allowed them to govern without the free democrats which 
increased their seats in parliament from 57 to 79

kerin trepke began working for the greens 
seven years ago eager to assist a party that championed the 
environment and the underprivileged she didnt know her destiny 
was the unemployment line 
the greens which have brought together ecologists womens 
rights activists peace activists and others under one banner will 
nearly vanish from the federal legislature as a result of sundays 
elections 
they will continue to exist as a political party and lobby 
group but with far less clout 
on monday the partys headquarters was full of despair leaders 
worried about the partys political future and hundreds of staff 
workers worried about their jobs 
i guess all of us who work here will be seeing each other at 
the unemployment officesaid ms trepke unfortunately having 
worked for the greens isnt exactly the best basis from which to 
launch a job hunt 
the greens election losses turned years of politicking into 
concern that the partys days might be numbered 
they still hold seats in some state parliaments and city 
councils but far below the numbers held before the allgerman 
balloting 
the greens pioneering west german branch which astonished the 
world by winning parliamentary seats seven years ago was voted out 
of office on sunday 
the party was rescued from parliamentary obliteration by a 
coalition consisting of their east german branch and a group of 
activists who helped topple east germanys communist government 
last fall 
still the greens were reduced from 48 deputies in the federal 
parliament to only eight 
their losses resulted from an often shrill opposition to 
chancellor helmut kohls unification plans and mainstream parties 
success in encroaching on greens political turf with promises to 
clean up the environment 
green arguments simply found no interest among the voters 
because of the german euphoria kindled by kohl said party 
spokeswoman renate dumas 
in addition deep ideological divisions within the party made 
the greens even more vulnerable 
on monday party leaders surveyed the scene and decided they 
should craft a new political concept at a congress early next 
year said spokesman christian stroebele 
we have been given something very painful to think about he 
said 
ms trepke a 46yearold single mother of two and greens 
researcher on womens rights issues said she feared years of work 
would go down the drain because of the election results 
this is a catastrophe just horrible she said policies 
on minorities on womens rights everything that weve done here 
could all fall flat 
a throng of party workers held an emergency meeting at greens 
headquarters to discuss their future 
the current greens lawmakers have a support staff of 266 and 
most will probably soon be out of work ms trepke said the 
greens spacious offices will be replaced by smaller quarters for 
the new lawmakers from eastern germany she said 
its all over for us ms trepke said we assume the new 
group will bring their own people 
wolfram grueber a 39yearold greens specialist on the 
homeless said he had no idea what he would do if he lost his job 
my work has been like a neverending road race and i had 
little time to consider what i would do instead he said 
he said he wasnt optimistic about finding a job with another 
political group 
weve made ourselves unloved to the established parties but 
thats all right that was our function

holiday giftgivers should avoid buying toys 
cosmetics and ornaments that come wrapped in excessive plastic and 
cardboard an environmental coalition said monday 
the third set of wastemaker awards handed out by rep frank 
pallone jr dnj and the wastewatch coalition of environmental 
groups was meant to encourage shoppers to think environmentally 
as with all wastemaker products it is the consumer and the 
taxpayer who pay the price pallone said he said special 
packaging costs more at purchase time and increases taxes for solid 
waste disposal 
us public interest research group and clean water action 
joined pallone and environmental action at a news conference to 
cite nine products that should be avoided 
the products purchased in the last three weeks at washington 
area stores include 
tiny model cars called matchbox super color changers made 
by a new jersey toymaker according to wastewatch they are 
packaged in formfitting plastic glued to a cardboard display card 
accompanied by a small sponge and disposable plastic tub for color 
changes 
the product thats been cited is not in the line and hasnt 
been for the last year said michele litzky spokeswoman for 
matchbox toys usa ltd of moonachie nj 
a trophy figure and a scorecard for the popular nintendo video 
game the accessory was cited for an oversized cardboard package 
and plastic window 
its a little surprising they selected a product that hasnt 
been sold since 1988 said wayne charness vice president of 
hasbro inc in pawtucket ri he said 90 percent of hasbros 
packaging is recycled fiber and the company has been increasing its 
use of recycled materials 
sears roebuck and cos four trumpetshaped christmas 
ornaments enclosed in a heavy plastic tray cardboard box and clear 
plastic lid wastewatch said sears offered a round tree ornament 
packaged in environmentally preferable recyclable cardboard 
our first concern is that the product is packaged so that when 
the customer opens it at home the product is not broken dented 
bent or scratched said gordon jones a spokesman for the chicago 
retailer 
however he said the company was working with suppliers to 
develop environmentally sound packages and had eliminated plastic 
foam from many of its holiday light sets

the music world monday mourned the death of 
composer aaron copland the son of immigrants whose genius earned 
him the title dean of american music 
copland died sunday at phelps memorial hospital in north 
tarrytown of respiratory failure brought on by pneumonia he was 
90 he had recently suffered two strokes 
he created the american sound in symphonic music said 
composer william schuman 
copland believed in the validity of american music that we 
were not inferior to our european cousins schuman said he 
wrote music only an american could have written 
copland was being cremated and the funeral service was private 
said his attorney ellis freedman a public musical tribute is 
planned he said 
copland was known for his plainspoken compositions such as 
appalachian spring rodeo and billy the kid the 
brooklynborn son of jewish immigrants from east europe was 
remembered in death as the prototypical american composer 
he had a uniquely american voice and was able to express in 
his music particularly american sensibilities using substantially 
the language of european serious music said kenneth haas 
managing director of the boston symphony orchestra 
coplands composing career gave the world such popular pieces as 
fanfare for the common man an orchestral composition the late 
leonard bernstein once called the alltime top of the hit parade 
in american music 
copland won the 1944 pulitzer prize for composition for 
appalachian spring which was commissioned by choreographer 
martha graham an oscar for his musical score of the heiress in 
1948 and the presidential medal of freedom in 1964 
graham on retreat in hawaii after completing a sixweek far 
east tour called copland a very dear friend and a very great 
artist 
aaron and i and appalachian spring have had such a long 
journey together she said in a statement released by her 
manhattanbased dance company it is very difficult for me to 
accept that he is gone 
another dance great agnes demille also mourned coplands 
death but outspoken as always demille said she did not think of 
copland as a worldclass composer 
he was a very great composer the finest we had hes not by 
any means in a world class but i liked him awfully she 
said he was wonderful to work with charming to be with an 
expert worker 
demille recalled when copland told her he had started conducting 
and mentioned how much he enjoyed it by the way he was a bad 
conductor she interjected and continued 
he then said agnes have you ever conducted and i said 
of all the damn fool questions you ever asked me aaron that one 
takes the cake 
the anecdote shows the simple side of copland a man who many 
described as a downtoearth uncomplicated genius 
usually geniuses are selfcentered and i thought how can a 
man be a genius and still be so nice recalled pulitzer 
prizewinning composer david del tredici who claims copland as his 
mentor 
copland quit composing in the early 1970s and swore he didnt 
miss it 
youd think if you had spent 50 years at it youd have the 
feeling that something was missing and i really dont he told 
an interviewer 
i must have expressed myself sufficiently i certainly dont 
feel tortured or bitter only lucky to have been given so long to 
be creative and resigned to the fact that it appears to be over 
at his birthday celebration two weeks ago copland ate apple 
pie which he preferred to cake surrounded by longtime friends he 
read messages from young fans 
he was not the least pretentious said schuman if you 
didnt know he was one of the greatest artists of the century you 
would never suspect it 
copland taught at the boston symphonys tanglewood music school 
in lenox mass for 25 years and was head of the faculty there 
when he stepped down in 1970 his students included bernstein and 
composer lukas foss 
he lived a very productive 90 years haas said happily 
we will have his music to appreciate even though we dont have him 
any more 
copland a lifelong bachelor is survived by a niece felice 
marlin of manhattan and two nephews ralph marcus of stuart fla 
and burton marcus of woodmere

after 15 years of civil war 
marxistinspired oneparty rule foreign invasion and economic 
crisis angolas leaders begin a new strugle on tuesday to 
radically change the nature of their country 
president jose eduardo dos santoss party is to debate plans at 
a congress being held to introduce multiparty democracy and a free 
market economy and to discuss peace terms with the usbacked 
unita guerrilla movement 
in preparing to emulate his allies in the soviet union dos 
santos faces a challenge from hardliners within his popular 
movement for the liberation of angola or mpla they have yet to 
follow him in dropping marxist rhetoric and embracing his new 
option of democratic socialism 
in 11 years as party leader and president of the wartorn 
southern african nation dos santos has survived the jockeying for 
power within the mpla 
he has given strong signals in recent months however that he 
plans to abandon the communist model and open the political system 
to opposition forces including unita the national union for the 
total independence of angola 
jonas savimbis unita rebels have been fighting the mpla since 
angola gaindd independence from portugal in 1975 
the two sides opened peace talks in portugal last april to end 
their war which has devastated what is potentially one of the 
richest countries in africa 
at the fifth round of talks last month portuguese officials 
mediating the negotiations said a ceasefire was in sight 
a truce must be followed by political changes allowing unita a 
stake in angolas future 
this weeks congress is to discuss major constitutional reforms 
aimed at removing the ruling partys position as the guiding force 
in society legalizing opposition groups and preparing for general 
elections 
dos santos says a multiparty system can be implemented early 
next year 
to ensure support for the changes he is expected to remove at 
least five longtime members from the 13member politburo and 
officially shed the partys marxist ideology 
subsaharan africas secondlargaest nation angola is rich in 
oil diamonds and other minerals it has an abundance of arable 
land and wellstocked atlantic fishing grounds its deepwater 
ports at luanda and lobito could be a key economic outlet for other 
southern african nations 
but fighting has crippled economic activity and cut 
communications only exports from the heavily guarded northwestern 
oil fields have kept the economy afloat 
also an estimated 2 million of angolas 10 million people face 
famine after a fouryear drought 
dos santos concedes that war was not the only cause of angolas 
economic woes he admitted in a recent address before 700 
businessmen in luanda that the centralized system adopted by all of 
portugals african colonies after independence resulted in many 
errors 
the most important dos santos said was not understanding the 
role of private enterprise in angolas economic recovery 
he promised reforms that would aid smallbusiness owners and 
encourage foreign investment a longawaited devaluation of the 
kwanza was introduced in september as part of an austerity program 
the government and unita remain divided on such issues as the 
timing of elections integration of the two armed forces and the 
composition of an international force to verify a ceasefire 
while both sides have expressed cautious optimism after last 
months talks fighting has flared since unita commandos conducted 
daring raids on economic targets in the luanda area last week 
blowing up bridges water pipes and electricity lines they damaged 
the luanda oil refinery leaving the capital facing energy and gas 
shortages 
a cuban officer and two soldiers were killed in the attacks 
cuba maintains about 10000 soldiers here from the estimated 
50000 stationed in angola since the late1970s in a 1988 
agreement with south africa which had made incursions into angola 
cuba said it would withdraw its force and south africa pledged to 
halt its aid to unita 
the united states has said it will not stop helping unita until 
the government guarantees the rebels a role in a mulitparty 
society

the us department of energy said monday 
it is investigating an engineers complaint she was harassed after 
warning that emptying two tanks at the hanford nuclear reservation 
could cause an explosion 
her warning was later vindicated by a general accounting office 
report that said too little was known about the explosive potential 
of the tanks 
engineer inez austin contends employer westinghouse hanford co 
is destroying her career because of her alert 
ken morgan of the department of energys richland office said 
monday that the agency takes harassment of whistleblowers 
seriously we do not have much firsthand information about ms 
austins case he said 
a hanford watchdog group said the incident was the latest in a 
pattern of harassment against whistleblowers on the reservation in 
southcentral washington hanford for decades produced plutonium 
for nuclear weapons but now is largely focusing on cleaning up 
years of contamination at the federal site 
the harassment of whistleblowers who are trying to protect 
the public from extremely dangerous waste tanks is rampant said 
gerald pollet of heart of america northwest 
six weeks ago energy secretary james watkins toured hanford and 
promised whistleblowers would be protected and rewarded last 
month westinghouse hanford issued guidelines for protecting 
whistleblowers 
ms austin who made her concerns public saturday said weve 
always been told if there is a problem go to your manager and if 
there is a safety concern they will listen it is a blow to find 
out it is not true 
last june ms austin contends she demanded a delay in the 
pumping of radioactive liquids from two waste storage tanks that 
the company did not want to grant the pumping was canceled anyway 
after the gao report 
the tanks contained ferrocyanide which could explode if 
internal tank temperatures top 400 degrees fahrenheit the chemical 
was added in the 1950s to concentrate the tank liquids 
ms austin who had served on a panel that analyzed the safety 
of pumping 22 tanks containing ferrocyanide had been asked to 
approve the emptying of two tanks she refused saying that 
removing liquids could cause the internal temperatures to rise 
possibly to dangerous levels said tom carpenter an attorney for 
the private government accountability project 
the next day she argued with her supervisor and another engineer 
over the refusal carpenter said 
westinghouse spokesman john burk said the technology did not 
allow enough of the liquid to be removed from the sludge at the 
bottom of the tank to raise internal temperatures he also said 15 
of the frrocyanide tanks had been pumped in the past without 
incident

intimating that he would disclose it publicly disclosure could 
be highly detrimental to the security of the united states the 
memo said

weber is saying just in who he is saying it to

will happen to weber after jan 11 because he has been given

an undetermined number of persons were injured some with severe 
burns authorities said all the severe injuries and deaths were 
believed to be among people on the pittsburghbound plane 
authorities said 
as soon as i heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop said 
robert karp a passenger on the 727 i remember looking at the 
other plane and seeing smoke rolling out 
muncaster said that apparently the the right wing of the 727 hit 
the aft section the engine of the dc9 taking the engine off 
muncaster said that resulted in the fire he said that at 
this point is all we know 
he said that at the time of the 145 pm crash the airport had 
been closed to inbound traffic because of fog but they were 
allowing planes to take off a winter storm had moved through the 
area earlier in the day 
passengers from the 727 walked off the plane down the stairs 
said karp 60 a college professor from jackson miss 
when the impact occurred he said i thought the tire had 
blown out the front end of the plane had begun to lift off i 
dont think the back wheels were off the ground yet passengers 
were shook up but unhurt he said 
the wing appeared to be torn from the plane 727 passenger 
edward duda said 
tony dresden a spokesman for the national air traffic 
controllers association said according to preliminary reports from 
the scene the dc9 pilot became lost on the runways 
the pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information 
about his position and turned right onto the runway where the 727 
was taxiing he said 
the dc9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he 
was and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off 
that runway but it was too late dresden said stressing that 
the description of the accident was preliminary 
edward mcnamara wayne county executive said there were at 
least some survivors on the dc9 and that the only injuries on the 
boeing were those that occurred during the evacuation of the plane 
linda kalinsky taylor ambulance co said we were told that 
there were 50 or 60 injuries including some burn victims 
originally the federal aviation administration said the planes 
wingtips struck later northwest said the wing of the 727hit the 
rear section of the dc9 
after the accident one of the planes could be seen surrounded 
by emergency vehicles smoke pouring from what appeared to be a 
burned fuselage tail blackened by fire the fuselage appeared to 
be hollowed out as if by flames 
by an hour after the accident the fire was apparently out 
mcnamara said 
as dusk settled in around 4 pm a stand of huge lights were 
wheeled into place near the cockpit of the dc9 on runway 3c to 
allow firefighters and investigators to see 
at the time of the crash weather was foggy and the ground was 
wet from a morning snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at the 
airport 
at least 11 people were brought or en route to annapolis 
hospital in wayne said spokeswoman pat odowd and at least one 
was in critical condition two of the victims at that hospital were 
transferred to the university of michigan medical center burn

156 people were killed 
the airport was closed briefly after the accident and later 
reopened

the education department will ask congress to 
toughen the higher education act to cut down on defaults in the 
federal student loan program an official said monday 
leonard l haynes iii assistant secretary for postsecondary 
education told a banking convention that student loan defaults are 
costing the nation nearly 2 billion a year he said the figure is 
simply unacceptable although it may pale against other federal 
agency debts 
to reduce the default rates haynes said the department will 
seek to toughen major provisions in the higher education act when 
it comes up for reauthorization next year the law is the statutory 
authority for about 60 higher education programs 
haynes said the department may require stringent performance 
standards of both students colleges universities and trade 
schools before they are allowed to join student loan programs 
there also may be greater scrutiny of administrative and financial 
abilities of schools as well as the quality of education offered 
he said 
we will not reinvent the wheel but we believe we must create 
a more efficient fairer and less confusing student aid delivery 
system while continuing to maximize postsecondary access and 
choice for needy students he said 
haynes speaking at a consumer bankers association conference 
stressed that we are committed to taking the lead on reforming 
student financial aid and other higher education programs 
what we have in place is not serving us well said haynes 
but the question is how good is better 
the total of student loan defaults is 78 billion an estimated 
12 billion will be loaned to some 5 million students during fiscal 
1990 
this year the education department has come under harsh 
criticisms by members of congress for lax oversight of the federal 
student loan program 
a report by investigators for the senate government affairs 
subcommittee on investigations faulted the department for very 
minimal if any oversight over the accrediting bodies 
the department the report added granted schools eligibility in 
the student loan program without verifying that they were licensed 
and accredited 
the department will place a greater emphasis on performance 
standards and outcomes measures in the areas of school 
accreditation eligibility licensing and student success 
haynes said 
haynes said performance standards might focus on an 
institutions ability to keep and graduate students once enrolled 
as well as dropout and passfail ratios and placement rates 
although the department cannot assess curriculum haynes said 
it may use the outcomes of the educational program to determine 
its quality 
in addition haynes said we hope to eliminate unscrupulous 
recruiting techniques and weak admissions standards that often have 
misled students into poor quality schools and defaults on loans

the united states cannot be sure economic 
sanctions will ever force iraq out of kuwait and waiting for such 
an uncertain outcome would risk erosion of the international 
coalition behind military force defense secretary dick cheney said 
monday 
cheney laying out to the senate armed services committee the 
administrations rationale for building up a military force for 
possible attack in the persian gulf gave the most pessimistic view 
yet on the potential of sanctions to work 
given the nature of the regime given saddam husseins 
brutality to his own people his very tight control of that 
society his ability to allocate resources for the military their 
ability to produce their own food he can ride them out 
cheney told the committee 
several of the panels democrats including chairman sam nunn of 
georgia contended the administration seemed to be dismissing 
sanctions too easily if we go to war we never will know whether 
they would have worked nunn said 
sen john glenn dohio voiced misgivings about a chicken 
little approach to our policy the sky is falling and the only 
option is war 
cheney spelled out in detail the us position that american and 
international interests are in jeopardy in the gulf risis 
contending that saddam might gain a stranglehold on oil that he is 
destroying kuwait and that his continued military buildup that 
could mean further aggression 
it is not so clear that time is altogether on our side 
cheney said a stamen that appeared in conflict with earlier 
administration pronouncements as recently as oct 15 cheney 
himself had said the opposite 
he said monday that lengthy reliance on sanctions would cede to 
saddam the ability to determine future events such a policy 
would give hussein a long breathing space during which he could 
augment his army cheney contended 
it is far better for us to deal with him now than it will 
be for us to deal with him five or 10 years from now when the 
members of the coalition have gone their disparate ways and when 
saddam has become an even better armed and more threatening 
regional superpower than he is at present cheney said 
as for authority to attack saddam cheney said in response to a 
question from sen edward m kennedy i do not believe the 
president requires any additional authority from the congress 
before committing us forces to achieve our objectives in the 
gulf 
many democratic lawmakers have strongly urged the bush 
administration to give the sanctions more time to work before 
mounting an attack aimed at pushing iraq out of kuwait and have 
said congress must have a clear role in any decision to attack 
house speaker thomas foley dwash drew a standing ovation 
when he told a meeting of house democrats on monday that before 
any decision is made by the president to take military action 
he should come to the 102nd congress that congress begins 
early next month 
at the pentagon meanwhile officials said cheney had signed an 
order raising from 125000 to 188000 the number of national guard 
and reserve members who can be ordered to active duty suggesting a 
new round of activations 
there are 96834 members of the army navy air force marine 
corps and coast guard reserves on active duty 
in major developments last week the un security council 
authorized force against iraq if kuwait is not freed by jan 15 
and president bush said he would send secretary of state james a 
baker iii to iraq for an eyetoeye lastchance meeting with 
saddam before that date 
baker asked monday why he is going said that if the use of 
force is to be a credible option for the us government we need 
to make certain the american people understand we are leaving no 
stone unturned in the search for a peaceful solution 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said iraq had not 
formally responded to bushs proposal for baker to fly to baghdad 
and for iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to visit the united 
states for talks though diplomats from both sides are discussing 
preliminary scheduling 
ms tutwiler said negotiating teams have agreed that any talks 
be limited to the united states and iraq 
scheduling has been discussed at two meetings so far in baghdad 
during both meetings she said joseph wilson the charge 
daffaires at the us embassy in baghdad raised concerns about 
the american hostages in iraq but heard nothing new from the 
iraqi government 
she said about 88 americans remain hostage in iraq their 
numbers thinned by the release last weekend of 15 detainees 
joint chiefs of staff chairman colin powell appearing with 
cheney said the us gulf force clearly has an offensive 
capability to force iraqs occupying force out of kuwait 
for iraq the question they will have to consider is do they 
move it or do they lose it powell said adding if it is 
necessary to go to war we go to war to win 
powell said while the large and growing us force is difficult 
to supply logistics is a manageable problem for the moment the 
united states now has more than 240000 troops in the region and 
bush has ordered an additional 200000 who should be in place by 
january 
we have the possibility of keeping the force at that level for 
some period of time he said there will come a point where it 
will become very difficult to keep that force in place for an 
extended period when pressed for a time period he said one year 
is possible

house democratic leaders are proposing new 
rules to let lawmakers accept unlimited donations to cover any 
legal costs they may incur in the upcoming redistricting 
rep martin frost dtexas sponsor of the proposed rules change 
unveiled monday said the redistricting process will generate many 
costly lawsuits and lawmakers need to protect themselves 
but fred wertheimer president of common cause said the house 
democratic plan if approved would accomplish exactly the opposite 
of what the public wants 
the party caucus is to consider the proposed rules change 
tuesday 
its as if no one there is paying any attention to the keating 
five hearings going on across the street in the other chamber 
said wertheimer referring to the senate ethics hearings on 
influence peddling in the savingsandloan scandal 
congressional districts across the nation will be changed as a 
result of the new census the outcome could critically affect many 
1992 house races 
the likelihood is high that a number of members would want 
legal advice said frost who heads a democratic group reviewing 
house rules and making suggestions for changes 
many lawmakers were considering how to deal with the cost frost 
said but the law regarding the special legal funds was gray and 
at your own risk 
frost said his proposal was more strict than some approaches 
since public reporting of the donations would be required 
asked if the plan raised ethical questions he said as long 
as you have public disclosure the answer is no 
under the frost plan lawmakers would establish redistricting 
accounts and would have to report contributions to and spending 
from them that reporting would be done as part of congress annual 
financial disclosure process which allows a lag of up to 1 years 
between the transaction and the public reporting of it 
normally house rules limit gifts to members at 200 under the 
frost plan that limit would be waived for any donations for legal 
costs associated with redistricting in addition federal election 
law limits on campaign donations would not apply 
wertheimer whose group lobbies congress to upgrade its ethics 
standards said he was sending a telegram to all house democrats 
urging them to turn down the plan in their caucus tuesday 
it would create an outrageous loophole for opening the door 
for outside special interests to provide unlimited contributions to 
help a member of congress in a critical electoral matter he 
said 
this is a time when the house should be taking steps to 
eliminate the ability of outside interest groups to provide money 
to elected officials who decide their interests he said

hardline legislators on monday praised president 
mikhail s gorbachev for responding to their criticism and 
replacing the interior minister with a kgb general expected to 
crack down on dissent tass reported 
col victor alksnis who has threatened to seek gorbachevs 
resignation if he does not take action by dec 17 to prevent the 
breakup of the soviet union termed the replacement of interior 
minister vadim bakatin a step in the right direction 
gorbachevs removal of bakatin is obviously a response to the 
ultimatum by alksnis who heads the soyuz group of rightwing 
legislators said dmitri simes a soviet expert at the carnegie 
endowment for peace in washington but simes said it was difficult 
to know if gorbachev was sympathic to their demands or surrendering 
to them 
alksnis denied that a crackdown would lead to more violence 
but only because he believes bloodshed is now inevitable 
mountains of weapons have been stockpiled in the republics 
threatening us with uncountable disasters he warned 
soyuz is expecting gorbachev to relieve other officials it finds 
unacceptable as well said another member legislator yevgeny 
kogan 
gorbachev also plans to transfer several divisions from the 
regular army to the interior ministry troops which handle 
outbreaks of ethnic and political violence inside soviet borders 
said independent lawmaker vladmir kirillov according to tass 
bakatin is popular among some liberals for keeping tighter rein 
on his riot police since 19 peaceful demonstrators were killed by 
troops wielding shovels and gas in tbilisi last year 
he was replaced by boris pugo a communist party official who 
became a kgb major general while running the secret police in 
latvia in the early 1980s 
pugo is a friend of alksnis simes said both men are latvians 
who are extremely unpopular in their native land for their 
opposition to independence from the soviet union simes said 
pugos deputy will be army gen boris gromov who won fame for 
commanding soviet troops in afghanistan while still in his 30s he 
is considered a hardliner and a prime candidate for a high post in 
the defense ministry which gorbachev also has promised to shake 
up 
legislators who declined to be named said the interior ministry 
post may be a means of keeping gromov out of a top job at the 
defense ministry 
simes speculated that pugos major task will be controlling his 
new deputy 
bakatin previously has been mentioned as a possible candidate 
for prime minister he was nominated for president last spring and 
declined to run against gorbachev 
alksnis accused bakatin of allowing the breakdown of the 
ministry the official news agency said 
he is fully responsible for the blood spilt in moldavia 
alksnis charged referring to a series of violent confrontations 
between separatist ethnic groups in that southwestern republic 
bakatin was not only passive but he rendered concrete support 
to separatist forces in the republics alksnis charged the soyuz 
group sharply criticized bakatin for allowing independenceminded 
estonia take control of its own interior ministry and police from 
the central government 
reformist legislator galina starovoitova told tass the reaction 
in the republics to the changes may be extremely negative she 
said the russian republic plans to demand that the functions of the 
interior ministry be removed from the central government entirely 
gromovs appointment could mark a blow to the plans of several 
republics to form their own militias the army general has said 
that allowing separate armies for each nationality would be 
disastrous 
pugo chairman of the communist partys control committee since 
1988 and strong gorbachev supporter must be confirmed by the 
supreme soviet legislature tass said

the editorial staff of the jerusalem post went 
on strike monday in protest over plans to dismiss 27 journalists 
the dispute began when the management announced last month that 
it intends to lay off 60 people including the 27 news people as 
part of an effort to reduce manpower to pay old debts 
but workers said the strike was called to fight what they called 
an attempt to shatter its union 
the management is trying to break the union by forcing some of 
the workers to sign personal contracts in contradiction to a signed 
agreement between the workers committee and the management said 
a union spokesman who asked not to be identified 
he said that publisher yehuda levy had abrogated a signed 
agreement with the workers committee by sending dismissal notices 
to 27 journalists 
they are presenting workers with ultimatums either sign a 
personal contract or leave said the spokesman 
he said that an agreement signed between the management and the 
workers committee stipulated that a maximum of 20 percent of the 
staff could hold personal contracts 
but the management he said told the committee sunday that 
everybody would have to be employed on personal contract basis 
israel television said that the newspaper would be published 
tuesday despite the strike 
publisher yehuda levy was not available to discuss the 
workers action or the intended dismissals the newspapers editor 
n david gross refused to speak on the telephone and relayed a 
message that if he had something to say he would put out a

a doctor who invented a device that a 
woman used to kill herself was charged with firstdegree murder 
monday by a prosecutor who said he didnt want his county to become 
a suicide mecca 
janet adkins 54 of portland ore died june 4 after being 
hooked to the device invented by dr jack kevorkian of royal oak 
she had been diagnosed in june 1989 with alzheimers disease 
kevorkian connected adkins to an intravenous solution that would 
stop her heart but she activated the switch that allowed it to 
flow into her veins 
a recently completed toxicology report identified the solution 
as the cause of death oakland county prosecutor richard thompson 
told reporters in announcing the charges the autopsy also showed 
the woman suffered from alzheimers disease 
kevorkian faced a court appearance on the charge 
dr kevorkian was the primary and legal cause of janet adkins 
death he cannot avoid his criminal culpability by the clever use 
of a switch thompson said he constructed the suicide machine 
for the sole purpose of causing death he saw janet adkins for the 
sole purpose of causing her death 
the criminal charges were filed one day before a civil trial in 
oakland county circuit court to determine whether kevorkian could 
have his machine back it was confiscated after the womans death 
the timing of thompsons charge angered kevorkians attorney 
geoffrey fieger who said he had tried to find out from thompsons 
office what charges would be filed before the news conference 
i find this to be a moral and legal outrage fieger said 
after the charges were filed it is an attempt by the prosecutor 
to grandstand it is an attempt by the prosecutor to institute 
criminal proceedings to obtain an advantage in a civil case 
fieger also said he was outraged at the firstdegree murder 
charge which carries a possible life prison sentence on 
conviction 
he would like this to be the execution capital of the world 
fieger said referring to thompsons recent statements that he 
would like to seek the death penalty for drug dealers michigan 
does not have the death penalty 
yet he doesnt want terminally ill patients who seek a death 
with dignity to be able to make that personal decision 
at his own news conference after thompsons kevorkian referred 
all questions to fieger 
ronald adkins the victims husband said he had no immediate 
comment about the charges 
ronald and janet adkins traveled from oregon to meet with 
kevorkian after she was diagnosed as having alzheimers disease 
the couple belonged to the hemlock society an organization that 
promotes death on demand for the terminally ill 
janet adkins was not terminally ill she was not suffering any 
pain the prosecutor said for me not to charge dr kevorkian 
would turn oakland county into the suicide mecca of our nation 
derek humphry executive director of the eugene orebased 
group said he was surprised by the charges since michigan has no 
law against assisting in suicide legislation that would outlaw 
assisted suicide is pending 
this will be quite a job getting a conviction because the law 
in michigan is extremely ambiguous humphry said 
adkins had been diagnosed with alzheimers disease in june 1989 
at good samaritan hospital in portland said hospital spokesman 
chuck williams 
people dont die of alzheimers they die of other things 
indirectly caused by alzheimers williams said im sure what 
the prosecutor was looking at was that she was under no direct 
threat to her health but if the autopsy confirmed alzheimers 
theres no question she would have died of the disease

the rebel leader who marched nearly 
unchallenged into the capital dissolved chads parliament and 
suspended the constitution monday while promising a multiparty 
democracy chad radio reported 
idriss deby called by some the desert cowboy did not 
immediately assume the presidency but his popular salvation 
movement was effectively in charge of the central african nation 
deby drove into the capital of ndjamena on sunday in a black 
mercedes after president hissene habre fled to neighboring 
cameroon 
deby was habres chief aide in a 1982 coup but deby broke away 
last year and formed a rebel movement habre and us officials 
claim libya funded debys rebellion but the libyans and deby deny 
it 
earlier monday deby freed at least 450 libyan prisoners of war 
cameroon state radio reported monday that habre and eight of his 
ministers had taken refuge there french government officials also 
said they had information habre was alive the official libyan news 
agency jana claimed sunday that habre had been killed 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said us 
officials believe libya supplied debys rebels the french press 
also widely reported libyan military aid to deby 
ms tutwiler said ambassador richard w bogosian plans to meet 
with deby 38 
chad radio denounced the economic moral and political chaos 
of the previous regime and the abuses of a delinquent dictator 
habre was an obstacle in the way of national reconciliation 
between chadians and an obstacle to good neighborliness and the 
bonds of history and common suffering between libyans and 
chadians jana said 
according to the constitution adopted dec 10 1989 the 
national assembly president becomes interim leader in habres 
absense but with the constitution suspended by deby there was no 
president named and it was unclear how the post would be filled 
france chads former colonial ruler had recognized assembly 
president jean alingue bawayeu as the interim leader 
before dissolving the body deby met with alingue other coup 
leaders held talks with highranking officials of the deposed 
government 
my worry is not to be president of the republic said deby 
after entering the capital this country must become democratic 
pluralist the moment has come to lay down our arms 
france with nearly 1800 troops in chad had backed habre since 
he came to power but remained neutral in the latest conflict 
which started nov 10 in eastern chad 
habres forces last month were defeated in a series of battles 
on friday rebel troops entered the main eastern city of abeche and 
marched around french troops who took no action 
libyas occupied northern chad in 1983 and 1986 prompting 
france to send troops to back habre libya was driven out in a 
series of lightning battles masterminded by deby in 1987 
libya has demanded freedom for its captured soldiers and still 
claims a mineralrich strip of land in northern chad the pows left 
for libya monday 
rebels in allterrain vehicles mounted with machine guns zoomed 
through the city monday spreading their control from key 
administrative buildings to workingclass neighborhoods french 
troops guarded the airport and other key facilities such as 
telecommunications and electricity centers 
ndjamena was calm following weekend looting a curfew remained 
in effect 
habre was elected to a new sevenyear term in june it was the 
first contested elections in 30 years of independence but 
candidates were limited to independents and members of habres 
ruling party 
french foreign legion troops helped organize the evacuation of 
about 1600 foreigners over the weekend most evacuees were french 
but about 50 american dependents were on the flights

a senior senate colleague defended the 
integrity of the keating five senators before the ethics committee 
on monday while away from the hearing law enforcement sources said 
the fbi was examining the lawmakers conduct as well 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii told the ethics panel that the 
five senators whose conduct is the subject of the hearings appeared 
to be providing typical service to a constituent when they 
intervened with savings and loan regulators on behalf of sampl owner 
charles h keating jr 
inouye specifically endorsed the conduct of sen dennis 
deconcini dariz who was described in prior testimony by 
regulators as a negotiator for keating in two 1987 meetings 
keating donated or raised 13 million for the five senators 
campaigns and causes 
i do not believe sen deconcini crossed the line between 
proper and improper action inouye said referring to deconcinis 
request that regulators waive a thrift regulation that was harming 
keatings lincoln savings and loan if it was improper all of us 
at one time or another have done that 
inouye said he appeared as a defense witness over the 
objections of his staff because i believe what is on trial here 
is not the five colleagues of mine but the us senate and for 
that matter the congress of the united states 
meanwhile law enforcement sources speaking only on condition of 
anonymity said the fbi is looking into the senators conduct as 
part of a wideranging investigation being coordinated with federal 
prosecutors in los angeles and phoenix 
examination of the senators dealings with keating is one aspect 
of the broad federal criminal inquiry into allegations of financial 
wrongdoing at lincoln savings and its parent american continental 
corp 
justice department officials declined to comment on a report in 
mondays washington times that the fbi is focusing on allegations 
of vote trading and bribery against two of the senators democrats 
alan cranston of california and deconcini 
the other members being investigated by the senate ethics 
committee are john glenn dohio donald w riegle jr dmich and 
john mccain rariz 
deconcini denounced the newspaper report saying he had not been 
questioned as part of a criminal investigation i think im being 
terrorized by such an article appearing he said 
deconcini spokesman robert maynes said that last spring the 
senator gave to the fbi all the documents he submitted to the 
ethics committee 
this was in connection with the investigation of keating 
maynes said we turned it over in response to an fbi request 
cranstons attorney william taylor said cranston was not the 
target of a criminal investigation but had provided information 
requested by the justice department as part of its investigation 
into keating 
at the ethics hearings in their 10th day inouye was followed 
by cranstons former chief fundraiser who testified that in 
retrospect i believe keating linked his contributions to 
cranstons help for lincoln 
joy jacobson was asked by cranstons attorney did sen 
cranston ever say to you when the contributions were made whether 
it was expected he would act in any way for keating or american 
continental 
no she responded 
ms jacobson said she not cranston was controlling the 
timing of solicitations of keating adding she was unaware that 
cranston was contacting regulators for keating at the same times 
earlier inouye told the ethics committees six senators that 
constituents who are also campaign contributors often ask for help 
when they believe they are treated unfairly by federal agencies 
he called the five senators men of unimpeachable character 
and added if everything turned out well if we did not have this 
sampl crisis if mr keating was once again able to revive lincoln 
savings and loan these men would be heroes to their constituents 
they were able to save jobs 
today they are damned because the endeavor failed so i think 
we are on trial here the us senate 
the hawaii senator said a constituent has every right to 
expect service from us even if the case is not a good one 
but he added that if a senator took an action that was 
specifically tied to a contribution then it not only is 
inappropriate but is a violation of the law

the bush administration monday predicted in a 
report to congress that the us trade deficit would remain steady 
even though americans are paying sharply more for imported oil 
prepared by the treasury department as a requirement of the 1988 
trade law the report also indicated that a further decline in the 
value of the dollar was not needed to improve the nations trade 
balance 
it predicted a sustaining of the progress made in reducing 
the current account deficit which is the broadest measure of trade 
and includes investment flows 
the deficit has dropped from a peak of 162 billion in 1987 to 
129 billion in 1988 and 110 billion in 1989 during the first six 
months of 1990 it ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 87 
billion 
the us deficit and japanese and german surpluses are being 
further reduced this year despite repeated prognostications that 
the external adjustment process had come to a halt and that 
balances would resume widening the report said 
international monetary fund forecast indicate the us deficit 
will remain below 100 billion next year despite the runup in oil 
prices the report said however it noted that the standoff in the 
persian gulf between the united states and iraq made predictions 
more uncertain than usual 
i dont view that as tremendous news said economist robert 
g dederick of northern trust co in chicago a number that is 
stalling out at around 100 billion is still a problem 
moreover he and other economists said the prediction likely 
would prove true only if the price of oil falls next year and if 
economy topples into a recession as many analysts believe is 
happening 
my guess is the treasury department is right for the wrong 
reasons said economist michael k evans who heads a washington 
consulting firm trade deficits always narrow in a recession 
because people buy fewer imports 
the reports stance on the dollar reflects a shift in the 
thinking of administration officials who as recently as two months 
ago expressed little concern with the currencys decline so long as 
it was orderly 
a lower dollar helps the us trade deficit by making american 
goods cheaper abroad and foreign goods more expensive in the united 
states 
however a falling dollar encourages inflation in the united 
states by reducing americans spending power it also tends to push 
up the interest rate foreign investors demand to finance the us 
budget deficit 
when the treasury last issued its trade report in april 
officials were concerned about the advance of the dollar against 
the japanese yen but since then the dollar has fallen 18 percent 
against the yen and is trading near postworld war ii lows against 
the german mark 
the report said further adjustment of external imbalances 
should rely primarily on macroeconomic and structural policy 
measures rather than on further exchange rate adjustment 
macroeconomic and structural policy measures is a reference 
to us efforts to cut its budget deficit reducing the need for 
foreign funds and german and japanese efforts to stimulate 
consumer demand for us goods 
evans and dederick said the administrations shift toward 
supporting the dollar was made to counteract foreign disappointment 
with the fiveyear budget deficit reduction pact enacted at the end 
of october 
the report said the deficit reduction pact demonstrates the 
united states commitment to putting its economic house in order 
but dederick said this is not viewed abroad as very 
meaningful

the house reelected its leaders on monday 
the democrats by acclamation and the republicans by aggravation 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash majority leader richard 
a gephardt dmo and majority whip william h gray iii dpa 
all will return to their jobs for the 102nd congress they were 
unopposed and received standing ovations from the democratic 
caucus 
on the republican side minority leader robert h michel 
rill and minority whip newt gingrich rga also had no 
opponents 
but the no 3 republican jerry lewis of california and the 
party campaign chairman guy vander jagt rmich both survived 
only after bitterly fought campaigns 
lewis was challenged by rep carl pursell rmich a moderate 
who received heavy behindthescenes support from gingrich and his 
allies 
lewis and gingrich are the most talkedabout contestants for the 
job of republican leader when michel retires possibly in 1992 
during this years budget battle lewis backed president bush 
while gingrich bolted and helped bring down the presidents 
compromise package that included higher taxes pursell and the 
gingrich group tried to oust lewis in part because of his stance on 
that issue 
lewis prevailed 9864 and then appeared to fire the first shot 
in the expected 1992 race to succeed michel the outcome he told 
reporters was somewhat of a disaster for gingrich and his 
allies their purpose was not to help carl pursell but to dump 
jerry lewis he said 
pursell asked what gingrichs support did for him said merely 
i think newt has been somewhat hurt by his election back home 
gingrich was reelected to congress by less than one percent of the 
vote 
gingrich however declared victory 
it was clear that the conference wants a more activist 
conference thats part of why he had a challenge i suspect youll 
see jerry being a little bit more active gingrich said 
vander jagt withstood an assault from rep don sundquist 
rtenn who had to repeatedly deny charges he was put up to 
running by the white house 
sundquist accused vander jagt of allowing mismanagement and 
cronyism at the republican national campaign committee and vander 
jagt promised a review 
the vote in their contest was 9866 
the democrats caucused monday without bernie sanders the 
vermont socialist who had sought to organize with the democratic 
party to obtain his committee assignments 
foley told reporters afterward that the democrats as the 
majority party would find sanders a committee assignment but not 
as part of their caucus

the us ambassador to chinas description of 
antichina demonstrators as cowards was a spontaneous 
remark that does not represent his position or the governments 
the state department said monday 
were all human beings said margaret tutwiler commenting 
on the remark by james lilley 
lilley who made the comments saturday night in seattle 
apologized for the comment he said protesters opposed to chinas 
human rights policies provoked him by calling him an obscene name 
it was a mistake in the first place lilley said of the 
incident before he addressed chinese and american delegates at the 
conclusion of a threeday sinous trade conference i shouldnt 
have done it 
lilley who left seattle on sunday for tokyo made the comments 
in a brief interview with the seattle postintelligencer 
the ambassadors spontaneous remark does not represent the 
considered views of the united states government nor indeed of 
ambassador lilley himself as he clearly articulated in his speech 
later that day tutwiler said 
no one appreciates better than ambassador lilley the challenge 
of working for reform and human rights in china she said 
she said lilley would not be reprimanded 
lilley got into saturday nights argument with a handful of 
demonstrators when he arrived with chinese ambassador zhu quizhen 
about 50 demonstrators waved signs and chanted slogans condemning 
the attack on prodemocracy demonstrators at tiananmen square and 
chinas 40year occupation of tibet 
jim berman 32 whose wife is tibetan said he and a halfdozen 
others left the main group on the chance the ambassadors might use 
a side entrance 
they chanted china human rights tibet for tibetans 
and remember tiananmen square he said 
zhu ignored the demonstrators and went inside berman said 
but berman said and a videotape corroborated that lilley 
suddenly shouted were you at tiananmen square i was there 
youre a bunch of cowards lilley yelled looking back at a 
35yearold tibetan whom he apparently mistook for a chinese you 
go back to china and serve china 
china invaded tibet in 1950 crushed an uprising in 1959 and 
introduced repressive measures including suppressing tibetan 
buddhism 
the 63yearold lilley who was born in china was appointed to 
the ambassadorship by president bush he is a former cia 
intelligence officer and former ambassador to south korea and also 
has served us missions in the philippines taiwan cambodia

a key to what caused two northwest airlines 
jets to collide on the ground at detroits airport monday could lie 
in the communications between the control tower and both pilots 
national transportation safety board investigators will analyze 
tapes which record cockpit conversations as well as all 
communications between federal air traffic controllers in the tower 
and planes on the ground and in the air around the airport 
planes are not supposed to move on the ground unless air 
traffic controllers say they can said ntsb spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz the tower has direct control 
the only discretion a pilot has on the ground at an airport is 
the option of aborting his takeoff once clearance for takeoff is 
given lopatkiewicz said 
he said however it was too early to reach any conclusions 
about the detroit accident investigators will look at all aspects 
of pilot and controller actions aircraft construction airport 
design and other factors that might have contributed to the 
accident 
federal aviation administration officials at first said the 
wingtips of the boeing 727 and dc9 struck as they were taxiing for 
takeoff but a northwest officials said the wing of the 727 sliced 
into the tail end of the dc9 taking off one of its two 
rearmounted engines 
at least 19 passengers died as the dc9 burned and both planes 
were evacuated 
ordinarily federal aviation administration controllers in the 
airport tower can see all the planes on the approach to runways at 
major airports but a winter storm had just moved through the 
detroit area and it was foggy at the time of the collision 
the airport was closed to inbound traffic 
lopatkiewicz said investigators would obtain and analyze both 
control tower and cockpit tapes as soon as possible the control 
tower tapes of radio communications eventually may be aired 
publicly but only edited transcripts will be made public for the 
onboard recorders which are made from microphones in the planes 
cockpits

janet adkins 54 of portland ore died june 4 after being 
hooked to the device invented by dr jack kevorkian of royal oak 
she had been diagnosed in june 1989 with alzheimers disease

stop her heart but she activated the switch that allowed it to 
flow into her veins

air force planes bombed two 
columns of rebel tanks monday in a bid to put down the final 
remnants of a failed rebellion the uprising left at least eight 
people dead two days before president bush was to visit 
the rebel tanks were rendered useless the local news agency 
noticias argentinas reported 
earlier hundreds of rebels were forced out of a tank factory 
an infantry base several coast guard buildings and another army 
installation in the fourth uprising by the restive argentine 
military in as many years 
in contrast to three uprisings under thenpresident raul 
alfonsin president carlos menem and army chief gen martin bonnet 
refused to negotiate with rebels who demanded a shakeup of the 
high command and a bigger military budget 
menem in his 16th month of power early monday declared a 
nationwide state of siege that suspended constitutional guarantees 
and gave him sweeping powers to ensure public order he threatened 
to declare martial law under which rebels could be executed 
by 8 pm the only remaining rebel stronghold was army 
headquarters in downtown buenos aires two blocks from government 
house 
the planes attacked two tanks moving along a highway in the 
capital and about a dozen traveling in neighboring entre rios 
province 
casualties were not disclosed but at least three soldiers and 
five civilians died as a result of the rebellion five people died 
and at least 20 were injured elsewhere in this city when a tank 
collided with a bus 
eight soldiers were injured the army said along with at least 
10 civilians including three reporters according to news reports 
despite the insurrection bush said from brasilia that he 
planned to arrive as scheduled on wednesday 
white house spoksman marlin fitzwater said it seemed likely the 
incident was intended to embarrass menem before bushs visit 
its also the reason we want to make clear our support for 
democracy and president menem fitzwater said 
us officials indicated they did not consider the uprising to 
be a serious threat to the menem government 
this is not a coup a rebel spokesman told reporters we 
recognize the authority of president menem as commander in chief 
the army estimated the rebels numbered 200 the rebels claimed 
they had 700 followers 
the rebels said rather then trying to overthrow the government 
that they were seeking changes in the way the military is run 
the uprising began before dawn when rebels their faces 
blackened commandostyle took over several floors at army 
headquarters about the same time other rebels seized the palermo 
infantry base and the tank factory 
bonnet demanded in a nationwide tv and radio broadcast that 
rebels surrender unconditionally or the army would suffocate 
them 
about 45 rebels surrendered in the port along the river plate 
after failing to take over coast guard headquarters presidential 
spokesman humberto toledo said 
another 98 including rebel leader col enrique baraldini 
were arrested at the palermo infantry base five miles to the 
northwest the scene of some of the heaviest shooting the army 
said 
about 60 rebels were captured by soldiers of the military school 
at a batallion on the outskirts of buenos aires after several 
morter rounds were fired 
the last areas of conflict very rapidly are going to end 
presidential toledo told staterun atc channel 7 tv 
nevertheless by late afternoon rebels remained holed up inside 
army headquarters a multistory office building where the chiefs 
of staff meet two blocks behind government house 
a group of about 12 rebel tanks was prevented from crossing the 
parana river into buenos aires province 
earlier the insurgents ignored a demand by bonnet for an

president bush is consolidating the hold of 
conservative republicans on the federal judiciary that began during 
the eight years of the reagan administration a liberal advocacy 
group said monday 
the alliance for justice which last summer opposed the 
confirmation of supreme court judge david h souter said in a 
yearend report that bush is continuing president reagans legacy 
of naming hardline conservatives to the federal bench 
through its judicial choices the bush administration is 
waging war on the notion of a fair and representative federal 
judiciary nan aron the groups president said in a statement 
nominees to the federal bench continue the reagan 
administrations tradition of hostility toward individual rights 
and restricting access to the courts aron said 
the alliances report also criticized the senate judiciary 
committee for accelerating the confirmation process therefore 
providing less time for senators to consider the qualifications 
of each nominee and for the general public to participate 
president bush is changing the legal landscape aron said 
it is up to the senate judiciary committee and the public to 
ensure that the legal rights of the disadvantaged are not trampled 
in the process 
the report noted that the senate gave quick approval in the 
closing days of the congress to the nomination of a former aide to 
sen strom thurmond the ranking gop member of the judiciary 
committee 
just 10 days after he was nominated dennis shedd was confirmed 
for a district court judgeship in thurmonds home state of south 
carolina despite a lack of experience as a courtroom lawyer and a 
low rating from the american bar association 
the alliances report was issued two days after bush signed into 
law a bill that creates 85 new federal judgeships besides these 
newly created slots there are 41 vacancies on the federal bench 
vacancies that bush will soon have an opportunity to fill 
president bush is following the course of his predecessor in 
choosing appellate judges with dependably conservative records and 
in the next two years he will have the opportunity to tilt the 
balance even more the report said 
bush promoted many district judges appointed by reagan to 
circuit court seats positions where ideology is most apt to 
influence judicial decisionmaking the report said 
fifteen of the 23 nominees bush proposed for federal circuit 
courts were district court judges that reagan had first appointed 
to the federal bench the report said 
the report also faulted bush for failing to live up to promises 
to appoint more qualified women and minorities to the federal 
bench 
women have accounted for 116 percent of bushs appointments to 
the federal judiciary compared to 155 percent under president 
carter women accounted for 82 percent of reagans appointees the 
report said 
bush has appointed only three blacks 38 percent of his 
nominations so far compared to 37 named by carter reagan 
appointed eight blacks 21 percent of his nominees to the 
federal judiciary

a jetliner clipped another while preparing 
to take off from the detroit airport in heavy fog monday igniting 
a fire that killed at least 19 people and left one plane in smoking 
ruins 
at least 20 people were injured in the collision between a dc9 
and a boeing 727200 both operated by northwest airlines although 
it was not immediately clear how the collision occurred a 
spokesman for air traffic controllers said the dc9 appeared to 
have become lost on a slick foggy taxiway and strayed into the 
727s path 
for nearly an hour after the accident smoke billowed out of the 
fuselage of the dc9 where passengers apparently became trapped by 
the fastmoving fire by the time the fire was extinguished much 
of the planes roof was open to the overcast sky 
the dc9 flight 1482 to pittsburgh was carrying 39 passengers 
and four crewmembers according to the airline the 727 flight 299 
to memphis was carrying 146 passengers 
both flights had originated in detroit said patrick mccann a 
northwest spokesman at its headquarters in egan minn 
apparently the right wing of the 727 hit the aft section the 
engine of the dc9 taking the engine off said alan muncaster 
another northwest spokesman that resulted in the fire that at 
this point is all we know 
at the time of the crash visibility was poor and the ground was 
wet from a morning snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at 
detroit metropolitan airport muncaster said the airport had been 
closed to inbound traffic but that planes were being allowed to 
take off 
tony dresden a spokesman for the national air traffic 
controllers association a union representing air traffic 
controllers said there was about a quartermile visibility in the 
air but only about 800 feet on the ground 
weve had some discussions with our people out there 
dresden said the dc9 pilot became lost on the runways the 
pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information about his 
position and turned right onto the runway where the 727 was 
taxiing 
the dc9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he 
was and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off 
that runway but it was too late 
he stressed that his information was preliminary the federal 
aviation administration which supervises air traffic controllers 
did not immediately comment about dresdens statement 
investigators from the national transportation safety board were 
being dispatched to begin a probe aimed at determining the cause of 
the accident a safety board spokesman said 
one survivor from the dc9 41yearold john izzo said he was 
dozing when he heard a bang felt a thud and then all of a 
sudden there was a blast 
i saw the fire to the right rear the whole top burned away 
but something was definitely blown away because something flew over 
my head said izzo a westinghouse nuclear engineer who was 
returning to pittsburgh from a business trip 
izzo said he escaped by jumping from a wing to the ground he 
was not hurt 
the people that made it down and out were crawling through the 
slush into the middle of the field he said i just watched the 
fire spread across the plane and engulf the entire fuselage 
izzo said he was seated in row 10 and believes people in the 
rows behind him could not get out 
the body of the 727 did not appear to have been seriously 
damaged in the collision one passenger 60yearold robert karp of 
jackson miss said passengers from the 727 walked off the plane 
and down the stairs 
it sounded to me like it was a loud thump said karp a 
professor at jackson state university 
i thought the tire had blown out the front end of the plane 
had begun to lift off i dont think the back wheels were off the 
ground yet as soon as i heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop 
i remember looking at the other plane and seeing smoke rolling 
out 
three men who earlier had identified themselves as pilots were 
sitting across the aisle from him one of them said oh my god 
our entire wing is gone according to karp 
wayne county executive edward mcnamara said the only injuries on 
the boeing were those that occurred during the planes evacuation 
he did not say how many people were injured on the dc9 but said 
there were survivors 
linda kalinsky of the taylor ambulance co said there were 50 or 
60 injuries altogether including some burn victims 
twenty people were taken to four hospitals in the area 
including two who were taken to the university of michigan medical 
center burn center at ann arbor 
muncaster said surviving passengers were taken to the airport 
marriot hotel 
a family center was opened at a ramada inn about a mile from the 
scene 
as dusk settled in around 4 pm a stand of huge lights were 
wheeled into place near the cockpit of the dc9 on runway 3c to 
allow firefighters and investigators to see 
at about 5 pm rescue workers hoisted body bags from the dc9 
and handed them to others on a wing 
mcnamara said 12 bodies were recognizable other bodies were 
in the plane the bodies would likely be taken to a morgue in 
downtown detroit 
romulus about 10 miles west of detroit was the site of the 
second worst air crash in us history the aug 16 1987 crash of 
a northwest md80 on takeoff in which 156 people were killed

elections it wants a caretaker government installed before new 
elections to prevent any repetition of what they call vote fraud 
we want ershads immediate resignation said kamal haider 
spokesman for bangladeshs major opposition alliances he has not 
announced any timeframe for the elections and thus he intends to 
buy time to hoodwink the opposition this is not acceptable

activists since the emergency was imposed on nov 27 and at least

reporters said like the witnesses the reporters spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
chittagong with about 2 million people is the secondlargest 
city in bangladesh dhaka the capital has about 7 million 
residents 
ershad said monday he was willing to hold elections to 
parliament and the presidency simultaneously 
the opposition campaign was focused on holding fair elections 
the president said adding 
im willing to hold free and fair elections and give democracy 
an institutional shape 
i firmly believe that the country is above an individual or 
party noble politics demands that we place the interest of the 
nation above everything else today is the historic day to initiate 
the noble process 
ershad imposed a state of emergency forbidding people to 
assemble and suspended all civil rights six weeks after the 
oftenviolent opposition campaign began 
the government also lifted press censorship monday imposed 
along with the emergency the information ministry credited the 
improvement of the overall situation in the country 
journalists have been on strike since nov 27 over the emergency 
and no newspapers have appeared in bangladesh since then no 
immediate word emerged on resuming publication

a former pan am security chief said 
monday he ignored a memo warning of a potentially dangerous 
situation at londons heathrow airport nine months before the 
terrorist bombing of flight 103 
the dec 21 1988 bombing killed all 259 people on board the 
pan am boeing 747 which took off from heathrow for new york 
eleven people also died on the ground in lockerbie scotland 
an attorney crossexamining daniel soneson asked what his 
response was to a memo from the airlines security chief in london 
warning about what he considered failings in security measures 
i didnt do anything soneson pan ams former systems 
director of corporate security told the public inquiry into the 
bombing 
james brwick pan ams security manager at heathrow at the time 
of the bombing has testified he sent a memo to his superiors at 
pan american world airways in march 1988 expressing concerns that 
the airline used xrays to search baggage instead of the hand 
searches required by the federal aviation administration 
soneson the systems director for 3 years said he thought the 
memo was very subjective and was berwicks opinion 
i believed xraying was an accepted practice and could detect 
components of a bomb he said if you physically searched you 
might not find them 
the attorney andrew hardie representing the british 
government asked soneson would you agree that this memo was 
alerting you to a potentially dangerous situation 
yes soneson said 
hardie asked soneson if he had considered changing the security 
procedures at frankfurt germany which relied exclusively on 
xray in light of an faa alert about a radiocassette recorder bomb 
that would be difficult to detect by xray 
no because it would be most difficult through physical 
inspection to find improvised devices soneson 50 said 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with passengers and luggage 
transferring to the jumbo jet in london 
the inquiry has heard that the bronze samsonite suitcase that 
contained the radiocassette recorder bomb was probably loaded in 
frankfurt 
pan am did not physically search luggage because the airline 
believed it had been granted a dispensation by faa director ray 
salazar soneson said 
but he told the inquiry there was no written record of the 
faas alleged dispensation which he said was granted at a meeting 
of the air transport authority in miami in october 1987 
under crossexamination soneson who is now general manager of 
the fort lauderdale fla airport acknowledged that no other 
usbased airline interpreted the faas decisions at the miami 
meeting in that way 
he also testified that he did not know that trans world airlines 
had applied for a dispensation from the hand search regulation in 
october 1988 and had been refused 
baggage handlers at londons heathrow airport have testified 
that bags from the connecting pan american world airlines flights 
including the frankfurt flight were not physically checked 
the inquiry is expected to last into the new year

prochoice activists hailed a us supreme court 
decision monday upholding a legal settlement that eased 
restrictions on illinois abortion clinics but antiabortion forces 
vowed to pursue the case in lower court 
the supreme court left intact a lawsuit settlement that rolled 
back restrictions on abortion clinics without comment the court 
rejected an appeal that contended the settlement does not 
adequately protect women or fetuses 
i think we anticipated that they would not hear it from a 
practical standpoint it was a good settlement said clinic owner 
dr richard ragsdale of rockford who sued the state to overturn 
regulations he said were unnecessary for abortions before 18 weeks 
the rejection is the latest setback to antiabortion activists 
who had hoped the court would use the ragsdale lawsuit to further 
tighten federal restrictions on abortion legalized in 1973 by the 
courts roe vs wade decision 
craig greenwood an attorney who represented the two nurses who 
filed the appeal said they had also filed the appeal in the 7th 
us circuit court of appeals and would pursue that challenge 
it was a remote shot but this is an issue that has divided 
the country for a number of years greenwood said we wanted 
the court to have an opportunity to show decisive leadership if it 
chose to 
ragsdale sued in 1985 challenging restrictions he said were 
unnecessary medically and in effect forced abortion clinic 
operators to build the equivalent of small hospitals or go out of 
business 
in 1985 a us district court suspended the regulations the 
courts suspension was upheld by the 7th circuit appellate court in 
1987 and state attorney general neil hartigan appealed to the us 
supreme court 
the justices last year agreed to hear the case but as they were 
about to hear arguments the dispute was settled by an agreement 
between hartigan and the american civil liberties union of 
illinois which represented ragsdale 
us district judge john nordberg in chicago approved the 
settlement in march the settlement established separate rules for 
two distinct kinds of abortion facility 
for women under 18 weeks pregnant abortions can be performed in 
clinic settings the states original regulations requiring 
fullservice surgical facilities still apply in pregnancies of more 
than 18 weeks 
a coalition of antiabortion groups opposed the settlement 
leading to the appeal acted on monday by the high court 
the appeal was filed by ritaellen murphy and penny greenwood 
two nurses who said the settlement does not adequately protect the 
health of expectant mothers 
aclu attorney colleen connell a member of the team that 
hammered out the 1989 agreement said oral arguments were scheduled 
for tuesday in the nurses appeal to the 7th circuit appellate 
court 
we were not surprised that the court rejected this attempt to 
bypass the court of appeals and their petition was totally without 
merit connell said 
joseph scheidler executive director of the prolife action 
league said his organization would try to persuade legislators to 
introduce new abortion restrictions when the state general assembly 
convenes next year

farmers in the russian republic may own land for 
the first time in more than 60 years but must wait a decade to sell 
it under a measure passed monday by the russian parliament 
farmers will be free now they will be free in choosing the 
ways and methods of their work and property russian president 
boris n yeltsin told a news conference after what he called an 
historic vote 
yeltsin said farmers told him that allowing private ownership 
would boost production in a year or two 
this winter however the soviet union must rely in part on food 
purchased or donated abroad 
after four days of acrimonious debate a hush fell over the 
russian congress of peoples deputies as lawmakers voted 86390 
with 40 abstentions to reverse a land policy in effect since 
dictator josef stalin carried out a bloody collectivization of land 
between 1929 and 1932 millions died in the resulting famine and 
soviet agriculture took decades to regain earlier production 
levels 
legislators cheered when the bill passed and yeltsin said later 
that euphoria is natural when people have waited so long 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has recommended a 
nationwide referendum on reversing collectivization but yeltsin 
said the solid majority in the russian parliament showed wide 
backing for the move 
many opponents of the measure doubt whether farmers would buy 
land they say that even before collectivization many small 
landholders in the russian republic worked under a communal system 
of land ownership private land ownership by small landholders was 
more common in other republics 
the national legislature has yet to approve the sale of 
farmland it was not clear whether passage of the measure by the 
parliament of the russian federation by far the largest of the 15 
soviet republics would force the kremlins hand or spark a 
constitutional battle 
the three baltic republics which declared independence earlier 
this year have also passed laws allowing private land ownership 
although the process is bogged down in disputes over property 
rights 
the newly elected noncommunist parliament of georgia is 
expected to pass a law soon allowing private farmland 
yeltsin said the measure passed monday will revive hundreds of 
thousands of russian villages that are being abandoned by farmers 
who find it impossible to earn a decent living on stateowned land 
selling at stateset prices to a state distribution system 
although private holdings will be allowed he said collective 
farm and other types of ownership will remain in existence 
competing for their place in the market all forms of ownership are 
equal and protected by law 
under the terms of the fourpoint resolution the russian 
legislature will enact laws specifying how to break up collective 
farms local legislative councils will have the final say on 
whether to decollectivize 
the resale of land would be blocked for 10 years and then it 
could be sold back only to the state 
parliament may decide to allow outright sale of land before 
the 10 years are over if we see that these processes are going 
smoothly yeltsin said 
russian farmers he said are set against buying or selling 
land because they are afraid land will be an object of 
speculation 
the original proposal would have allowed the resale of land 
after five years 
russian peasants are not used to selling land the land which 
is called mother said yeltsin some lawmakers have been saying 
that a mother is not for sale 
yeltsin also stressed the need to monitor shipments of foreign 
food into the soviet union over the next three or four months 
in this mess the mafia can make great use of this and 
sell it on the side he said 
soviet crop yields were high this year but much was lost due to 
poor transportation and storage facilities

foreign minister qian qichen said tuesday that 
chinas refusal to support a military threat against iraq 
disappointed us officials but wont derail chinese efforts to 
improve foreign relations 
this visit to washington was very successful and im very 
satisfied with it qian said upon returning from the first 
official chinese visit to washington since chinas military 
violently suppressed the prodemocracy movement in june 1989 
qian hedged when asked if he considered uschina relations 
normalized following his talks with president bush and other us 
officials 
both sides agreed to increase our contacts and exchanges so as 
to increase our mutual understanding qian said 
china gained considerable international goodwill by supporting 
the first 11 un security council resolutions aimed at forcing 
iraq to withdraw its troops from kuwait but china refused to 
support the measure passed thursday that clears the way for a 
military strike against iraq if its occupying army remains in 
kuwait after jan 15 
the security council approved the resolution 122 with china 
abstaining china as one of the five permanent security council 
members could have vetoed the measure 
the united states lobbied intensely for the resolution hoping 
to marshal universal support to show iraq the international 
community opposes its occupation of kuwait 
qian said the abstention would not hurt chinas efforts to 
improve foreign relations china drew widespread condemnation after 
its army opened fire on studentled demonstrators urging democratic 
reforms hundreds of people were killed 
china decides on its voting based on its own position and i 
think all countries understand that qian said the americans 
expressed a certain disappointment but they also expressed a 
certain understanding 
qian also said he welcomed bushs decision to send us 
secretary of state james a baker iii on a peace mission to 
baghdad 
it has always been our position there should be some 
dialogue qian said 
western countries and japan have gradually lifted sanctions 
imposed against china to protest the military crackdown 
western diplomats have acknowledged chinas improved 
international standing resulted in part from its cooperation during 
the gulf crisis 
japan sent its education minister to beijing in september and 
resumed lowinterest loans to china the european community voted 
in october to lift all sanctions except the ban on arms sales and 
defense cooperation 
the united states had tried to downplay qians visit to 
washington saying it didnt violate a us sanction against 
highlevel exchanges 
the us state department said the ban remains in place but 
applies only to exchanges of a formal and ceremonial nature 
bush made an exception to the ban when he sent national security 
adviser brent scowcroft to china in december 1989

pictures taken by the magellan spacecraft 
suggest that volcanoes still spew australiasized lava floods on 
venus and the planet didnt abruptly shut down after a 
globalsized eruption 400 million years ago 
venus is not dead southern methodist university scientist 
roger phillips said monday during the american geophysical unions 
fall meeting 
magellan hasnt yet found direct proof that volcanoes are 
erupting today on the planet but it seems likely venus is still 
volcanically active today said steve saunders magellans 
chief scientist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
the spacecrafts latest radar pictures of cloudcovered venus 
show there are absolutely no meteorite impact craters in an 
australiasized portion of the planets sappho region just north 
of the venusian equator phillips said 
that means the huge area is covered by lava that was deposited 
in a massive floodlike eruption sometime within the last tens of 
millions of years very young in geological terms phillips said 
it raises the likelihood venus is still active the dallas 
researcher added 
venus has to be volcanically active but demonstrating it is 
going to be hard said brown university geologist jim head a 
member of the magellan science team 
to show conclusively that volcanoes now erupt on venus magellan 
must fly over the same parts of the planet twice and look for 
differences caused by active lava flows that wont happen until 
next spring 
saunders said last month that most of the meteorite impact 
craters on venus appeared relatively young and fresh he said that 
suggested older impact craters were obliterated by gargantuan 
floods of lava 
at the time saunders said that either lava gushed from numerous 
cracks in the surface to flood 60 percent of venus during a single 
catastrophe about 400 million years ago or that a series of 
somewhat smaller but still giant lava floods inundate various 
regions of venus during different times 
the evidence phillips presented monday supports the second 
theory 
if a single global lava flood created most of venus lowland 
plains 400 million years ago meteorite impact craters should 
appear across much of the planets landscape but the pictures 
showing the uncratered region of sappho suggest that huge but not 
global lava floods occur on different parts of the planet at 
different times phillips said 
that in turn indicates massive volcanic flooding is an ongoing 
process of venus the second planet from the sun 
magellan was launched from space shuttle atlantis in may 1989 
went into orbit around venus on aug 10 and formally started making 
maps and pictures of the planet on sept 15 
as of monday magellan had orbited venus 847 times bouncing 
radar off magellans surface to make maps and pictures during more 
than 450 of the orbits said magellan experiment representative 
steve wall 
nasa engineers reported monday that magellan was unable to map 
venus during 3 orbits of the planet saturday and obtained only 
poorquality pictures during two other orbits 
a device that locates stars to help point magellan picked the 
wrong star because of electronic static that meant the 
spacecrafts main antenna was unable to point properly and collect 
radar echoes used to make pictures engineers fixed the problem 
saturday night by sending new computer commands to magellan

a spokesman for gen wojciech jaruzelski on monday 
denied a newspaper report that quotes jaruzelski as saying he was 
secretly whisked to the soviet union in 1981 and ordered to crush 
the solidarity movement 
gen jaruzelski did not say this said spokesman wlodzimierz 
lozinski there was no trip no plane 
the former communist leader who will be replaced after sundays 
presidential runoff repeated in an interview with the turinbased 
daily la stampa his contention he imposed martial law in order to 
avoid a soviet invasion 
he was quoted in sundays editions of the paper as saying he set 
out one evening for what he thought was a meeting in southwestern 
poland with the soviet officer in charge of warsaw pact forces 
but the soviet plane instead took him to a soviet military base 
just across the border in brest the newspaper quotes him as 
saying 
from there jaruzelski was taken to an empty train in a nearby 
station la stampa quotes him as saying on entering he found 
thensoviet kgb chief yuri andropov and the chief soviet 
ideologist and politburo member mikhail suslov waiting for him in 
one car 
try to get out of this by yourself was the gist of their 
conversation la stampa quoted jaruzelski as saying 
we dont want to be forced to help you but we certainly cant 
allow a change of system in poland jaruzelski quoted them as 
saying shortly thereafter in december 1981 jaruzelski declared 
martial law 
both andropov and suslov have since died andropov after a 
shortlived tenure as soviet leader 
in warsaw lozinski said the general had a lot of 
conversations with andropov and suslov but it was the author from 
la stampa who imagined that it happened in such circumstances 
the sentence used by mr suslov is quite probable these 
are obvious things except for the description of a nighttime trip 
to southwestern poland said lozinski who said he was present 
with jaruzelski during the interview with la stampa

the united states was grossly negligent in 
rubberstamping a canadian report on a 1985 plane crash that killed 
256 americans and both governments failed to investigate the 
possibility that terrorism was involved according to a 
congressional study 
the national transportation safety board should not have 
uncritically accepted canadas finding that ice on the wings caused 
the crash in gander newfoundland says the staff report prepared 
for the house judiciary committees subcommittee on crime 
we found no evidence that there was an investigation of 
possible terrorism by the canadians or the americans said the 
report which was obtained by the associated press on monday 
subcommittee members have not yet adopted the report 
it will provide the basis for a hearing tuesday into the dec 
12 1985 crash which occurred less than 30 seconds after liftoff 
from the airport at gander newfoundland 
us rep robin tallon dsc says the crash could be 
connected to the irancontra scandal he suggests the plane may 
have been the target of a terrorist attack as a reprisal stemming 
from irans unhappiness with a weapons shipment authorized by the 
reagan administration 
shortly after the plane went down in gander an anonymous caller 
said that islamic jihad a proiranian terrorist group had put a 
bomb on the plane 
no one in the united states government had detailed 
information on what was done by the canadians or by the united 
states government itself to determine that terrorism was not the 
cause said the congressional report 
it appears that fbi agents sent to gander the day of the crash 
waited in a motel for whatever reports or conclusions 
canadian authorities saw fit to share with them said the report 
which has not yet been voted on by the subcommittee members 
after a mere 36 hours they accepted a declaration that 
terrorism was not involved and returned home apparently 
without getting any evidence to bolster that conclusion it added 
spokesmen for both the ntsb and fbi declined comment both 
agencies will send representatives to testify at the hearing 
the chartered military flight operated by miamibased arrow air 
carried soldiers from the 101st airborne division coming home from 
peacekeeping duties in egypts sinai peninsula 
less than three weeks before the crash cia proprietary aircraft 
flew 18 hawk missiles from tel aviv to iran as part of the reagan 
administrations secret attempt to free us hostages held in 
lebanon 
the delivery of hawks wasnt acceptable to the iranians who 
wanted a more powerful version of the hawk and felt they had been 
duped 
white house aide oliver north used the iranians unhappiness to 
urge further shipments 
we stand a good chance of condemning us hostages held in 
lebanon to death as well as a renewed wave of islamic jihad 
terrorism if the iran initiative is discontinued north said in a 
dec 4 1985 computer message to his boss national security 
adviser john poindexter

james izzos eyes had closed and he was 
drifting into sleep as northwest flight 1482 taxied toward the 
runway at detroit metropolitan airport izzo a nuclear engineer 
was on his way home to pittsburgh 
the next thing he knew i heard a bang felt a thud and then 
all of a sudden there was a blast 
flight 1482 a northwest airlines dc9 had been hit by the 
wing of another jet and was on fire izzo jumped from a window 
over the left wing and onto the runway slippery with slush 
i just watched the fire spread across the plane and engulf the 
entire fuselage he said 
izzo was among the lucky ones monday one of those who escaped 
unhurt from the inferno that engulfed flight 1482 within an hour 
of his escape a charred hulk was all that remained of the jet its 
ceiling open to the sky 
it was not immediately clear how or why it happened or how many 
people had died this much appeared certain another northwest jet 
a boeing 727 departing for memphis clipped the dc9 on the 
taxiway setting it on fire the wing of the 727 was badly damaged 
but the rest of the plane was intact and its 146 passengers were 
able to escape without serious injury 
passengers on the memphisbound plane flight 299 said the 
collision felt like a heavy dull thud 
i thought the tire had blown out said robert karp 60 of 
jackson miss the front end of the plane had begun to lift off 
i dont think the back wheels were off the ground yet 
karp a professor at jackson state university who was sitting on 
the planes left side said people on the other side of the plane 
yelled oh my god our entire wing is gone 
as passengers left through the rear of the plane they saw the 
wreckage of the dc9 just 300 feet away 
thats when it really hit me when i saw the other plane at 
the end of the runway i thought my god how close were we to a 
broadside collision karp said 
another flight 299 passenger madana mohan kunjapur 29 of 
florence ala said we were just about to take off from the 
ground when we hit the other plane just like a heavy car tire 
hitting we knew either something had hit the wings or one of our 
tires blew 
i saw a blur and heard a thump said edward duda 55 of 
plymouth mich a materials engineer with ford motor co i saw a 
lot of fuel pouring out of the plane thats really what concerned 
me after i felt the impact i thought it was a tire blowout 
passengers on flight 299 generally were calm but i was pretty 
scared duda said

rep sam gejdenson dconn said monday 
presidentially inclined members of congress should be able to 
pursue their ambitions without risking their political hides 
gejdenson said he was introducing a bill to let house members 
and senators run for president and still appear on the ballot in 
their home state for their legislative jobs 
the bill adopt nationally the essence of a texas law designed 
for lyndon johnson and used by lloyd bentsen in 1988 to ensure he 
could run for vice president without giving up his senate seat 
texas is the only state with such a law gejdenson said 
it shouldnt just be texans who have the opportunity to run 
for reelection and president simultaneously gejdenson said 
and hhe country shouldnt be put in the position where a person 
of that experience should either remove himself from office or stay 
as majority leader or minority leader or committee chairman 
republicans viewed the legislation as a thinly veiled bid to 
widen the field of possible challengers against president bush in 
1992 
its nonsense said sen john chafee rri a close friend 
of the president if the states want to do it let them do it 
if legislators are not serious enough about the presidency to 
be willing to give up a senate seat or a house seat then theyre 
not serious about being president 
gejdenson said there is a crisis in a political system when 
seasoned elected officials stay out of the presidential fray 
because the odds are so long compared to the security of a powerful 
post on capitol hill 
political science professor larry sabato of the university of 
virginia said the gop would be crazy to go along with 
gejdensons proposal 
theyd just be encouraging opposition to george bush sabato 
said 
the texas law allowing a candidate to appear on the state ballot 
for two different offices was tailormade in 1959 for sen lyndon 
b johnson the texas democrat who ran for president the next year 
he lost the nomination to sen john f kennedy of massachusetts 
but was on the successful national ticket as kennedys running 
mate 
sen lloyd bentsen dtex used the law to his advantage in 
1988 when he ran for reelection while joining gov michael s 
dukakis in the presidential race 
the move backfired for dukakis though instead of helping 
dukakis carry texas many voters in the lone star state supported 
bentsen for senate and then voted for bush for president 
it was vote twice for texas sabato said so it actually 
ended up hurting the democrats bush of course claims texas as 
his home state 
the lbj law also cost texas democrats in 1960 for while johnson 
became vice president republicans won his senate seat and have 
held it ever since 
rep vic fazio dcalif incoming chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee said that while he thinks the 
plan has merit voters would have very little sympathy for it 
their current mood is for us not to run at all fazio said

at least four moderate earthquakes rattled 
parts of the world but there was nary a tremor monday along the 
new madrid fault where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to 
occur 
this is just a normal day said waverly person chief of the 
us geological surveys national earthquake information center 
were not backing the prediction at all 
along the new madrid fault some schools were canceled and 
residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town 
just in case climatologist iben browning was right 
browning said there was a 5050 chance for a major earthquake 
early this week along the fault which stretches from marked tree 
ark northeast through new marid mo to cairo ill he believes 
tidal forces can trigger earthquakes a theory most scientists 
reject 
theres just no way to predict an earthquake precisely said 
person who has been with the us geological survey for more than 
25 years there are no two earthquakes alike 
the center received more than 50 calls about the new madrid 
forecast monday morning and hundreds last week said person who 
began doing interviews for radio and television stations just after 
midnight 
as person talked 24 seismographs etched out activity recorded 
by monitoring equipment in different parts of the united states 
ranging from alaska to tennessee 
a needle jumped a few inches across the seismograph connected to 
monitoring equipment in tonopah nev person scanned the chart and 
called to a colleague it may be a nuclear test thats where 
they conduct those tests 
a few minutes later the needle jumped again thats not a 
test he said thats a quake 
with a measured eye he estimated the quake was magnitude 25 to 
30 on the richter scale quick calculations showed the quake was 
magnitude 35 centered about 30 miles southwest of ely nev 
between midnight and evening four moderate quakes were recorded 
at golden three were in the south pacific a 59magnitude shaker 
near new caledonia and quakes of 51 and 50 in the area of tonga 
the fourth was a 59magnitude temblor in northern colombia 
a quake of that size can cause considerable damage in a 
populated area but arent considered serious in remote spots 
about 800 quakes between magnitudes 50 and 59 are recorded each 
year said usgs spokesman don finley in washington 
the richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by an 
earthquake a quake of magnitude 2 is about the smallest felt by 
humans 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage the big san francisco bay area quake last year 
registered 71 on the richter scale 
in 1989 the earthquake center recorded 14604 earthquakes with 
a magnitude 1 or higher person said an average of 30 a day are 
recorded 
this fall there have been two in the new madrid fault area 
magnitude 46 on sept 26 and magnitude 35 on nov 9 which is 
not unusual he said 
although earthquakes can be tracked historically forecasting 
them is difficult if not impossible person said 
some people watch precursor activity but that doesnt always 
lead to an earthquake other quakes occur in a swarm over a period 
of time he said 
over the years he has heard countless earthquake predictions 
one woman called daily alerting person that an earthquake was 
about to occur based on the number of birds that crossed her 
windshield as she drove down the street 
the job he confesses is never boring

berlin a city that once symbolized a divided 
world is so united these days that two bitterly opposed political 
parties are talking about running the city together 
the conservative christian democrats defeated the leftleaning 
social democrats in sundays city council race just as they won 
the national german elections held the same day 
however christian democrat leader eberhard diepgen a former 
west berlin mayor and the united citys new mayorelect 
immediately asked the social democrats to think about joining his 
government 
both parties said monday they would begin talks on putting 
together a broad lefttoright coalition for a city that is 
without a doubt the most politically polarized municipality in 
germany 
what berlin now needs is responsible government said klaus 
landowsky general secretary of the berlin christian democrats 
he called a merger with the social democrats mathematically 
thinkable 
politically unthinkable however is forming a coalition with 
the thirdlargest party the former communists who used to run 
east germany 
the christian democrats won 403 percent of the vote the social 
democrats 305 percent and the former communists now called the 
party for democratic socialism finished with 92 percent 
traditionally if no party captures a majority the first place 
finisher would try to form a coalition with the thirdplace party 
because of the stigma of east germanys communist past however 
no mainstream german party wants to form an alliance with the 
former communists at any level of government 
sundays election was the first time in 44 years that eastern 
and western berliners once divided physically ideologically and 
psychologically by the berlin wall could vote for the same 
government 
diepgen a west berliner will be the mayor and have to put 
together a cabinet he will answer to a 240member legislature 
he will inherit a troubled city western berlin is a modern 
attractive metropolis faced with a housing crunch a violent 
radical leftist fringe and serious overcrowding 
west berlin always has been a state of perpetual bailout it 
spent much more than it took in annually because of huge subsidies 
from the former west german government which sought to keep afloat 
an island of democracy in a sea of stalinism 
with germany likely to face a cash crunch next year as the cost 
of unification some lawmakers may question whether berlin should 
continue to get a disproportionate share of federal money 
eastern berlin despite being the showplace of the former 
communist nation is beset with environmental problems rising 
unemployment bad roads and worse housing it is also a stronghold 
of the former communists

tavern owners opened their doors early 
the governor paid a reassuring visit and reporters lurked at every 
corner monday drawn by an earthquake forecast 
the prediction was dismissed by mainstream scientists but it 
certainly put this missippi river town of 3200 in the spotlight 
its a zoo out there all right said eugenia halterman head 
teller at the bank of new madrid on main street she said the 
goingson were making the usually hectic first monday of the month 
even more frazzling 
rose townsend the towns postmaster agreed 
she was handling a stack of postcards and envelopes that came in 
with requests for a dec 3 new madrid postmark when marilyn 
rhodes of ruston la stopped in seeking a postmark for her 
husband a stamp collector 
this will be a surprise an early christmas present she 
said 
the quake commotion was caused by iben browning a 
climatologist who said the chances were 5050 that a major quake 
would hit the new madrid fault zone in the 48 hours before or after 
dec 3 the fault runs from marked tree ark to cairo ill 
browning based his projection on tidal forces which on sunday 
were at their highest level in 60 years he also mentioned several 
other locations including tokyo and the middle east for possible 
quakes 
browning who lives in tijeras nm was on vacation and 
unavailable for comment said his daughter evelyn browning 
garriss 
earthquake experts and local seismologists have called 
brownings theory unscientific and said his projection is 
worthless but that didnt stop some schools from canceling classes 
and the sale of earthquake kits 
missouri gov john ashcroft toured new madrid and several other 
small towns monday to make sure everyone knew that there was no 
cause for alarm new madrid was the site of what are considered to 
be two of the nations strongest quakes in 1811 and 1812 the last 
major earthquake on the fault occurred in 1895 
panic is inconsistent with the appropriate response to living 
in an earthquakeprone area ashcroft said during a visit to the 
home of an elementary school principal whose school was closed 
at least four counties in southeast missouri closed their 
courthouses just in case browning was right some schools that 
stayed open reported higher than usual absences 34 percent in one 
southern indiana district 
in franklin tenn 30 miles west of nashville teachers let 
young students bring teddy bears and favorite toys to school for 
extra comfort 
in st louis and memphis tenn the two largest cities closest 
to the fault zone the projection didnt have much of an impact on 
the usual backtowork rush 
its just been another regular day said memphis police 
capt chuck ewerling 
radio commercials urged st louisians to buy a device called 
quake awake which is a sort of earthquake alarm clock that 
will sound when the ground moves the cost was 3995 and nextday 
delivery was available 
in new madrid at haps bar and grill owner jack hailey had his 
hands full serving the media and his regular customers who came in 
after shifts at nearby aluminum and power plants 
he had opened his shake rattle and roll party at 6 am to 
accommodate a radio station from st louis that was broadcasting 
live from his tavern 
but some local business owners said all the hoopla about 
earthquakes would be bad for the already depressed local economy 
and other residents werent too happy with the portraits being 
painted by journalists 
i think were being portrayed as a little backwards said 
sandra dial a postal worker who was tired of seeing farmers in 
overalls and folks sitting on bar stools as spokespeople for her 
town 
police chief jim helms said things were going smoothly 
so far we havent had a bit of trouble he said i kind of 
figured wed have some small problems not with the news media but 
with some of the clowns around town

residents of the lakeside village of 
santiago atitlan where soldiers killed 12 people and wounded 21 
last weekend on monday asked president vinicio cerezo to relocate 
the military base in nearby panabaj 
ramiro de leon carpio guatemalas attorney general for human 
rights promised a full probe of sundays incident and said he 
received a petition from the village with more than 15000 
signatures saying the village had constant problems with the 
military 
there are various versions both from the authorities in the 
area and the residents but what is sure is that there are innocent 
victims and this must be cleared up with the search for the truth 
about what really happened and putting those responsible in 
court he said 
santiago atitlan whose population is nearly 100 percent 
indigenous is in an area of guatemala where the countrys 
30yearold guerrilla movement has long been active 
according to one version the shooting started after men in 
civilian clothes identified as army troops tried to take a resident 
from his house without a warrant 
another version blamed it on disorderly troops who were drunk 
and firing their weapons 
there is agreement that villagers led by town officials were 
headed toward the military base when the shooting began in the 
early hours of sunday 
the morning newspaper el grafico quoted one of the injured 
estaban diaman coo as saying it was the army that opened fire at 
the people led by their mayor 
another resident nicolas raxtun sapuli said first the mayor 
tried to talk with the soldiers but unfortunately a rain of 
bullets came and we heard someone yell to get on the ground 
antonio rianda coche said he hit the ground wounded and two 
dead people fell on top of him before emergency workers took him to 
the hospital 
the soldiers in the military zone were replaced sunday night 
the army issued a bulletin sunday confirming the deaths and 
offered to investigate

more than 2000 people were murdered in new york 
during the first 11 months of 1990 making the year the citys 
bloodiest ever according to unofficial police statistics released 
monday 
new york city rang out 1989 with 1905 murders also a record 
high 
the citys 1990 homicide rate continued to increase as six 
people were murdered during the period from sunday night to monday 
morning police said 
the years record murder rate was partially attributed to the 
proliferation of handguns on the citys streets as well as a 
rising tendency toward violence said deputy inspector thomas v 
connolly of the departments office of management analysis amp 
planning which tracks crime statistics 
of the 1461 people murdered in the city during the first eight 
months of the year 65 percent were killed by guns according to 
the departments official figures which lag as much as four months 
behind the unofficial figures 
the homicide figures are subject to change because some deaths 
originally listed as murder could be reclassified later officials 
expect the number of killings to surpass 2000 because december 
traditionally has a high number of murders 
weve never seen as many guns as weve had this year weve 
never confiscated as many never had as many arrests for weapons 
connolly said he said 9410 guns were taken off the streets 
through the first six months of this year 
the motives of many of the killings were not known but connolly 
said many of the murders began as disputes or robberies and 
escalated because a weapon was used 
seventythree percent of the homicide victims were known to the 
people who killed them connolly said 
most of the murders 57 percent occurred on the street 
almost a quarter 24 percent happened during the commission of 
another crime most often robbery 
the exact date isnt known but the citys homicide rate passed 
the 2000 mark sometime during the last two weeks of november said 
department spokesman sgt peter sweeney

the washingtonmoscow hot line a cold war 
tool set up in the 1960s to prevent an accidental war will more 
likely be used in the 1990s for disarmament talks the army said 
monday 
contrary to popular belief the hot line is not a pair of red 
phones one in the oval office the other in the kremlin its a 
complex web of technology enabling the heads of state in both 
countries to exchange written messages directly by teletype and 
fax 
i suspect the future of this facility will be focused more on 
the remaining nuclear force reduction efforts verification and 
other issues that i suspect only our imaginations can address 
said lt gen jerome b hilmes director of information systems for 
the secretary of the army 
the hotline is maintained at fort detrick about 50 miles 
northwest of washington 
hilmes was at the base to announce completion of a 47 million 
renovation of the emergency communications link the improvements 
included new transmitters and receivers control consoles and a new 
pair of 60foot satellite dishes 
the hot line was established in 1963 11 months after tensions 
rose between the united states and the soviet union during the 
cuban missile crisis in that verbal altercation president kennedy 
forced the soviets to dismantle their missile bases in cuba 
the hot line has been used more than 15 times since then 
one of the most notable uses was during the sixday arabisraeli 
war in 1967 president johnson advised the soviet union of us 
ship and aircraft movements in the mediterranean sea after an 
israeli attack on the uss liberty 
though seldom used for its intended purpose the line is tested 
several times a day by technicians at both ends to ensure it works 
as the cold war ebbs routine maintenancerelated dispatches on 
the presidential hot line are becoming more informal said tom 
brothers manager of the fort detrick earth station 
american technicians and linguists have detected a freer flow of 
words in messages they exchange hourly with their soviet 
counterparts 
could we ask an unofficial question about basketball 
brothers said the soviets asked last february could you please 
tell us how our kurtinaitis performed against your snipers an 
apparent translation of longrange basketball shooters 
the soviets were referring to rimas kurtinaitis a 6foot5 
basketball star from lithuania the nba had invited kurtinaitis to 
challenge eight of the nbas best longdistance shooters in a 
3point contest in houston 
wed like to know how he feels in the nba the soviets said 
according to brothers 
he said the us hot line workers replied friends in the 
local newspaper it says that kurtinaitis is feeling fine but there 
are no results from the competition theyll probably be in 
tomorrows paper 
such informality was unknown several years ago brothers said 
the first hot line a transatlantic teletype cable was prone 
to interruptions a finnish farmer cut a hotline cable with his 
plow in 1963 in the 1970s a manhole fire north of baltimore 
severed the cables primary circuit about the same time american 
telephone workers accidentally cut the cables to the hot line 
today each hot line message goes to the soviet union three ways 
by land cable and two satellite systems the duplication is 
necessary to ensure messages get through during a crisis brothers 
said 
any message bush might send to gorbachev is encoded and taken to 
a terminal in washington the message is transmitted to fort 
detrick where the signal is enhanced and relayed to two soviet 
satellites 
the soviet satellites 22300 miles above the equator beam the 
message to antennae south of moscow

even if the baltic republics refuse to sign a new 
union treaty they will remain part of the soviet union unless they 
follow constitutional procedures for secession a top soviet 
legislator said monday 
rafik nishanov chairman of the council of nationalities one of 
two chambers in the supreme soviet legislature issued the warning 
to the baltics as he formally submitted the treaty to lawmakers 
another challenge to the treaty came from russian president 
boris yeltsin who said the giant republic would not sign until 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev recognizes the republics right 
to control its own economy 
gorbachev has been pushing hard for adoption of the treaty to 
hold the 15 soviet republics together 
it would replace the 1922 document that formally created the 
soviet union and would give the restive republics more economic and 
political autonomy but a strong central government in moscow would 
retain control over defense foreign policy taxation monetary 
policy electric power and transportation 
nishanovs speech indicated that the gorbachev government is 
maintaining a hard line on the issue of secession 
gorbachev sat on the rostrum during the legislative session but 
did not speak 
as expected the 542member supreme soviet formally referred the 
union treaty to its parent body the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies which meets dec 17 if the congress approves 
the document it will go to the 15 republics for ratification 
the baltic rpublics of latvia lithuania and estonia refused to 
participate in drafting the document and have said they will not 
sign it 
if the baltic republics dont accept such a treaty in my 
opinion they will remain in the soviet union on the basis of the 
documents with which they joined the union nishanov told the 
legislature 
he added that under the soviet constitution the baltic 
republics have a right to secede but only if they first hold 
referendums and then follow rules established by the national 
legislature those procedures could entail a waiting period of five 
years repayment for soviet investments and resettlement of 
russianspeaking people now living in the baltics 
latvia lithuania and estonia were occupied by the soviet army 
at the start of world war ii and were annexed in 1945 the kremlin 
has refused to recognize their declarations of independence this 
year saying they violate the soviet constitution 
the baltic republics contend that they were occupied by force 
and that their annexation was invalid the parliaments of all three 
republics meeting in joint session in vilnius last week demanded 
the removal of soviet occupation forces and international 
recognition of their independence 
in addition to the baltic republics armenia georgia and the 
ukraine have said they will not sign the union treaty in its 
current form georgias parliament has declared that it wants full 
independence and there are also strong independence movements in 
armenia and the ukraine 
without mentioning yeltsin by name nishanov attacked yeltsins 
proposal for bilateral treaties between republics 
forming a union without a center would be a step 
backwards he said 
but yeltsin said he would sign the treaty only when the 
declaration of russian sovereignty is recognized when the budget 
is separated when property is divided hard currency gold oil 
gas and so forth are transferred from soviet to russian control 
i will not compromise at the expense of russias 
sovereignty said yeltsin who has advocated greater russian 
control over its politics and economy since he was elected last 
may 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev the soviet army chief of staff 
told the legislature that defense had to remain a function of the 
central government 
he noted that defense installations and academies were spread 
across the country and he said nuclear weapons should remain under 
the control of only a few top officials 
no other way of handling nuclear weapons is possible 
akhromeyev said thats how its done both here and in the united 
states

president bush shrugged off a military 
revolt in argentina and proclaimed a new era of hope in newly 
democratic south america as he opened a fivenation tour monday 
bush vowed not to skip a visit to buenos aires and indeed the 
uprising there collapsed by days end 
the administration had expressed confidence the rebellion would 
be quelled quickly but also had left room for a late change in 
bushs plans 
if the situation became such that there was a real danger to 
his security im sure wed take another look at it said deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
the argentine crisis threw a cloud over bushs weeklong 
mission intended to celebrate the sweep of democracy throughout 
the hemisphere it also obscured bushs message that iraqs 
invasion of kuwait was driving up oil prices and forcing poor 
countries to pay high fuel bills that they could ill afford 
in argentina the government put down the last remnants of the 
uprising the fourth of its kind in less than four years by 
bombing rebel tanks the government news agency said the last of 
several hundred rebels had surrendered nine people were reported 
killed 
francisco rezek foreign minister of brazil called the revolt 
in argentina a step backward for democracy in latin america 
the bush administration took another view 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
monday evening that the situation in buenos aires does appear to 
be improving and that argentine president carlos menem was in 
control 
it is not a largescale uprising fitzwater said my 
argument would be that fundamentally democracy in argentina is 
working and when this is over it will demonstrate the roots of 
democracy in argentina are fairly deep 
bush said he would not abandon a planned stop wednesday in 
buenos aires where menem declared a state of siege suspending 
constitutional guarantees after the fourth military uprising in 
four years 
i have great confidence in the security there bush said 
administration officials accompanying bush talked throughout the 
day with us embassy officials in buenos aires 
the rebellious soldiers said they were not trying to overthrow 
the government but wanted to force changes in the way the military 
is run 
there also was violence in chile another stop on bushs trip 
as bombs exploded in a chapel and in the offices of two rightwing 
political parties there were no injuries an anonymous caller said 
the blasts were a protest of bushs visit 
bush arrived in brasilia at dawn after an overnight flight from 
washington accompanied by a mostly junior staff he was greeted by 
a 21gun salute and military pageantry at the pillared planalto 
palace the workplace of president fernando collor de mello 
the day ended with announcement of approval by bush to license 
the sale of a highperformance computer sought by brazil for more 
than two years the step was taken to reward brazil for agreeing 
along with argentina to renounce any intention to proceed with 
nuclear programs with a military dimension 
secretary of state james a baker iii remained in washington to 
testify before congress on the persian gulf white house chief of 
staff john sununu and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
also stayed home 
while celebrating the rebirth of democracy in south america 
bush put a strong emphasis on the persian gulf crisis and iraqs 
takeover of kuwait 
bush said czechoslovakia where he visited last month is paying 
15 billion in additional fuel costs because of iraqi president 
saddam husseins refusal to retreat 
collor during a picturetaking session with bush said brazil 
is paying 5 billion more for oil 
bush responded thats why when people say to me well 
this can go on and on and on i say no bush said 
bush raised the gulf crisis again during a speech to the 
brazilian congress i realize the sacrifices that saddams 
brutality has caused this nation and its people has caused many 
nations around the world 
he mentioned the fuel estimates for czechoslovakia and brazil 
and said it was the direct result of the brutality and the 
aggression of saddam hussein 
the military trouble in argentina put a cloud over bushs 
tribute to the sweep of democracy in the western hemisphere 
administration officials played down the problem one official 
referred to it as an intermilitary squabble 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson said theres a 
small group in the military that has certain grievances and every 
once in a while something like this happens 
fitzwater said the incident apparently was intended to embarrass 
menem before bushs visit 
the president wants to express his confidence in president 
menem and his support for democracy in argentina fitzwater said 
in an interview with cable news network collor said menem 
called him and said the uprising was the responsibility of a 
minority group and a very localized event with no practical 
consequence for democracy in argentina 
the past decade has seen a resurgence of democracy across latin 
america four of the five countries on bushs itinerary brazil 
uruguay argentina and chile emerged from military dictatorships 
in the past decade venezuela turned to democracy in 1958 
bushs trip comes at a time of unusual harmony in uslatin 
american relations and there were no burning issues on the agenda 
an administration official said its an oldfashioned question 
to be asking about possible us aid for latin america which 
suffered through soaring inflation and falling living standards 
during the 1980s 
bush told the brazilian congress all of us have been 
galvanized by a new era of hope and opportunity throughout the 
americas especially here in brazil 
he hailed the extraordinary political and economic change that 
is transforming the face of this hemisphere and described brazil 
as a leader in this effort 
in particular bush cited collors efforts at reducing the size 
of the state privatizing enterprises combating inflation and 
liberalizing trade 
these steps he said are the keys to growth and prosperity in 
the global economy of the 21st century 
collor put in place a draconian austerity plan which froze most 
bank accounts for 18 months and suspended automatic wage increases 
with inflation creeping back up and a string of industrial 
bankruptcies collors popularity has dropped sharply and his 
reform plan is in danger 
the centerpiece of bushs policy toward latin america is the 
enterprise for the americas initiative which is designed to 
achieve economic growth through expanded trade and investment and 
reduced debt 
brazils foreign debt is 112 billion the largest in any 
developing country the country is almost 10 billion in arrears on 
debt repayments and is negotiating a new repayment schedule with 
creditors 
brazil intends to reach an agreement that it can honor 
collor said monday night speaking at a dinner for bush we seek 
to reach a serious commitment with our creditors 
collor also said his country is determined to protect the amazon 
environment and be the leader of a crusade to harmonize the ends 
of economic development with the respect for the environment 
in his toast bush said i believe weve just begun to tap the 
true potentials of the americas and it is within our power to bring 
a new dawn to the new world together our opportunities are 
boundless and so let us forge a closer and more vital partnership 
to esnure lasting prosperity for all our people

of power refused to negotiate 
this is an attempted coup detat and will be treated as 
such he said after declaring a state of siege

residents capped just before nightfall by air force planes bombing

this is not a coup a spokesman told reporters we 
recognize the authority of president menem as commanderinchief 
asked their motives the unidentified lieutenant replied the 
same as during the holy week uprising our generals dont represent 
the sentiment nor the thought of our army

iraq said monday that the palestinian 
people must have a homeland in the west bank and gaza before any 
other mideast peace questions can be dealt with 
the first question is palestine iraqi delegate adnan malik 
told the general assembly palestine comes first palestine comes 
second and palestine comes third 
the united states has refused to link the palestine issue to 
iraqs withdrawal from kuwait president saddam hussein of iraq has 
said the palestinian problem must be on the agenda in any dialogue 
with secretary of state james a baker iii 
a general assembly subcommittee meanwhile voted 1321 to condemn 
iraq for purported human rights violations in kuwait iraq voted 
against the recommendation by the third committee which deals with 
social affairs zambia abstained 
the committee sent a draft resolution to the general assembly 
denouncing the continued and increasing acts of torture arrests 
summary executions disappearances and abduction in kuwait by 
iraqi forces 
it criticized baghdads refusal to let the red cross into kuwait 
and expressed grave concern over deteriorating living 
conditions under iraqi occupation 
in a letter to the security council ambassador mohammad 
abulhasan of kuwait charged iraq with ruining his homelands 
agriculture since seizing the emirate on aug 2 
with food shortages setting in said abulhasan kuwaitis who 
refuse to acquire iraqi identity documents are unable to obtain 
food or fuel 
he accused iraq of looting kuwait of at least 2000 arabian 
horses 20000 cattle and all the zoo animals and of converting 
parks into military camps 
the security councils committee on sanctions decided monday to 
allow a food shipment to soviets trapped in iraq but deferred 
action on a similar request for palestinians in kuwait 
a diplomat who attended the private meeting said the committee 
approved a one shot delivery of food for soviets outside 
baghdad whose diet is limited by rationing and available food 
supplies 
the soviet red cross will supervise distribution of food the 
diplomat said about 3500 soviets are still in iraq the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the soviets did not 
specify how many were in baghdad and how many were in rural areas 
at us insistence the committee deferred until its next 
meeting action on a similar request for food for palestinians 
living in kuwait 
the diplomat quoted abulhasan as having said the iraqis treat 
palestinians in kuwait better than kuwaitis 
malik said a radical solution to the question of palestine 
which guarantees an end to zionist occupation which guarantees the 
exercise by the palestinian people of their inalienable rights 
foremost of which is its right to selfdetermination and the 
establishment of its independent state with its capital alquds 
elsharif jerusalem this is the only way to solve the crisis in 
the region 
israel has occupied the west bank and gaza strip and controlled 
all of jerusalem since the 1967 middle east war most residents of 
the occupied territories are palestinians 
malik portrayed iraq as the hero of the palestines 
the united states of america and israel refuse recognition to 
the palestinian people among all peoples of the world the right 
to selfdetermination he said 
we must unmask the great gap between their claim to defend 
international legitimacy and the new international order on the 
one hand and their silence indeed their support for the crimes 
of the zionist entity 
to curb israel malik said iraq had created a preventive arab 
force capable of achieving a measure of balance to deter the 
zionist terrorists and put an end to their expansionist aggressive 
policies at the expense of palestinian people and the arab nation 
that has made iraq a major target in the zionistamerican

the earthquake that rocked the los angeles 
basin and caused 12 million in damage in february may only be the 
prelude to a nastier jolt to come scientists said monday 
the upland earthquake feb 28 which measured 52 on the richter 
scale failed to relieve stress on the san jose fault said egill 
hauksson a seismologist at the california institute of technology 
in pasadena 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy an earthquake 
releases as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
as a result of that unspent stress the san jose fault may 
produce a quake measuring 6 to 65 on the richter scale hauksson 
said during the american geophysical unions fall meeting 
scientists couldnt say when that might be he said 
the last quake of that size in the los angeles basin was the 
feb 9 1971 san fernandosylmar quake which had a magnitude of 
64 it killed 65 people and injured 2000 more as it collapsed 
freeway overpasses and caused 511 million in damage 
the new study of the san jose faults potential for disaster was 
conducted by hauksson and his wife us geological survey 
seismologist lucy jones 
roughly 11 miles long the san jose fault starts near the base 
of the san gabriel mountains north of upland and runs southwest 
near claremont and pomona 
the feb 28 quake was centered 3 miles northwest of upland a 
community 40 miles east of downtown los angeles it shook much of 
the los angeles basin causing minor injuries and 118 million in 
damage 
the quake ruptured the faults northeastern 2 miles 
the other 8mile section hasnt broken in any recent 
earthquake hauksson said he and jones analyzed the type of 
faulting caused by the aftershocks in a quake in 1988 and the one 
in february 
they concluded the two quakes failed to relieve stress on the 
rest of the san jose fault which by its length could produce a 
jolt of 6 to 65 magnitude 
there are still forces stored up in the region that could 
produce another earthquake as large or larger than what weve 
already had jones said 
but far worse has been projected for southern california the 
socalled big one on the san andreas fault that scientists say 
will measure 75 to 8 or more in magnitude 
a 1988 geological survey report said such an event quake is at 
least 60 percent likely by the year 2018 an earlier federal report 
said it could kill up to 14000 people hospitalize 55000 and 
cause 17 billion in damage 
but scientists believe the region will be shaken more often by 
smaller but still deadly quakes on other faults including the san 
jacinto fault the elysian park fault and the newportinglewood 
fault

iran persuaded the general assembly on 
monday to delete all references toexecutions illtreatment and 
torture from a draft resolution on human rights violations in 
iran 
to avoid a divisive vote sponsors removed language iran found 
offensive 
in return iran pledged to continue cooperating with un human 
rights investigations and to allow the red cross to visit its 
prisons 
a general assembly subcommittee on tuesday will recommend 
adoption by consensus of the toneddown resolution 
a vote on the original draft would have been a humiliating 
public rebuke to iran which then would have barred future visits 
by rights experts 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus called the original draft a 
lever to pressure iran into dropping its opposition to 
multinational forces posted in saudi arabia the radio said iran 
upset major powers by refusing to join the mostly american forces 
facing iraq after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
last week iran told italy and germany two cosponsors of the 
original draft their relations with tehran would suffer if it 
passed in that form 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said iran also 
let it be known that lucrative economic deals were at stake 
soaring oil prices caused by the crisis have given iran a 
multibilliondollar windfall 
the draft to which tehran objected was introduced thursday in 
the general assemblys third committee which deals with social and 
humanitarian issues 
reynaldo galindo pohl of el salvador prepared a study for the 
united nations that severely criticized the climate of fear he said 
he found in iran and reported abuses of due process and a 
startling number of executions 
the language deleted at iranian insistence would have had the 
assembly express its concern about the numerous allegations of 
violations of human rights contained in the report which according 
to the special representative have a credible basis notably those 
concerning executions illtreatment and torture 
it would have noted with concern the number of executions 
reported in iran 
the new draft expresses concern over allegations of violations 
of human rights contained in these reports by galindo pohl 
it asks iran to investigate and rectify the human rights 
issues raised by the special representative in particular as 
regards administration of justice and due process of law 
all the european community and nordic countries cosponsored the 
original draft but iran concentrated its efforts to amend it on 
italy now ec chairman and germany europes economic giant 
all 159 general assembly members are on the third committee so 
the committees action foreshadows the approach the entire assembly 
will take toward the resolution this month 
last week 32 us senators wrote to secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar demanding condemnation of iran as a rights abuser

the exotic calypsoflavored world of a papa 
doclike haiti is a far cry from a grim world ii soviet union but 
the caucasian chalk circle survives the transplant with most of 
its theatricality intact 
director george c wolfe has done an impressive job in moving 
bertolt brechts political parable into a magical mystical 
caribbean wonderland where violence and a childlike innocence 
exist side by side this revival which opened offbroadway last 
weekend at the new york shakespeare festival public theater 
reverberates with a sense of style and place that rarely betrays 
the material 
wolfe uses song dance outlandish costumes masks and puppets 
to tell brechts story of a kitchen maid who rescues the child of a 
deposed political leader and flees with the baby to safety after 
the revolution the biological mother wants her son back and the 
case goes before a peasantturnedjudge for resolution 
chalk circle has been transformed by thulani davis who 
skillfully adapted an englishlanguage version of the play moving 
the locale from the caucasus in 1945 to presentday haiti 
a long first act which actually cuts brechts cumbersome 
prologue captures the works fairytale quality several actors 
are of enormous help in telling the story particularly novella 
nelson as the strongvoiced narrator and charlayne woodard as the 
courageous maid who risks all for the baby in her fight for the 
child woodard displays a conviction that blends equal amounts of 
charm and determination altogether beguiling 
the show and the showmanship falter in a meandering act 2 when 
the parable shifts into political tract the humor becomes 
heavyhanded primarily because actor reggie montgomery who plays 
the judge mugs his way through the role montgomery manages to 
shrink what should be a star turn into a performance of sitcom 
size 
but it doesnt fatally damage the evening there are still those 
other distinctive performances to watch as well as the colorful 
costumes by tonileslie james and the mask and puppet designs by 
barbara pollitt and stephen kaplin 
wolfe has had other successes at the public including his own 
funny fractured revue of black life called the colored museum 
and spunk an adaptation of three short stories by zora neale 
hurston 
with the caucasian chalk circle hes shown he can take a 
masterpiece and turn it inside out and into something provocatively 
different

a federal judge on monday cleared the way for a 
retrial of former congressman robert garcia on charges he extorted 
payments from the scandalplagued wedtech corp 
us district judge leonard b sand denied a double jeopardy 
motion that claimed garcia a bronx democrat and his wife jane 
could not be tried twice for the same offense after an appeals 
court reversed their october 1989 convictions 
one might argue that a defendant should be required to run the 
gauntlet of the criminal process only once and that if a conviction 
fails for any reason to pass appellate muster the defendant must 
go free sand wrote in his opinion 
but the supreme court of the united states has clearly 
established the law is otherwise 
ronald fischetti the lawyer representing mrs garcia said they 
had not decided whether to appeal sands ruling garcias attorney 
robert morvillo was unavailable for comment his office said 
their new trial was scheduled to begin jan 21 
a threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
reversed the couples convictions in june on grounds there was 
insufficient evidence to prove one of two prosecution theories 
supporting the extortion charge 
the appeals court ruled that since the jurors did not specify 
which theory they adopted the garcias should be retried 
under sands ruling the new trial will focus on the theory that 
the garcias used the congressmans political office to obtain 
payoffs from wedtech a bronxbased military contractor that 
collapsed in 1986 in the midst of a corruption scandal 
the appeals court rejected the theory that garcia and his wife 
intimidated wedtech officers into making the payments 
the indictment accuses the garcias of extorting monthly payments 
totaling 76000 and obtaining a 20000 interestfree loan from 
wedtech in 1984 in return for future favors 
garcia 58 resigned his seat in congress in january after he 
and his wife were sentenced by sand to three years in prison with 
the recommendation they be released on parole after six months 
he began serving his sentence in march but was released in june 
after the appellate courts decision 
other politicians convicted in the wedtech scandal were former 
us rep mario biaggi and a former bronx borough president

a jetliner clipped another while preparing 
to take off from the detroit airport in heavy fog monday igniting 
a fire that left one plane in smoking ruins eight people were 
killed and at least 21 injrred officials said 
it was not immediately clear what caused the collision between a 
dc9 and a boeing 727200 both operated by northwest airlines a 
spokesman for air traffic controllers said the dc9 appeared to 
have become lost on a slick foggy taxiway and strayed into the 
727s path 
for nearly an hour after the accident smoke billowed out of the 
fuselage of the dc9 where passengers apparently became trapped by 
the fastmoving fire by the time the fire was extinguished much 
of the planes roof was open to the overcast sky 
officials had initially said that 19 people were killed but 
northwest officials and wayne county executive edward mcnamara 
later said that was wrong 
mcnamara said the medical examiner had swept through the 
wreckage twice and found eight bodies 
northwest spokesman doug miller said the airline had checked 
passenger lists and accounted for everyone except eight people who 
were presumed to be the victims he said 21 people remained in 
hospitals monday evening 
the dc9 flight 1482 to pittsburgh was carrying 39 passengers 
and four crewmembers according to the airline the 727 flight 299 
to memphis was carrying 146 passengers 
both flights had originated in detroit said patrick mccann a 
northwest spokesman at its headquarters in eagan minn 
apparently the right wing of the 727 hit the aft section the 
engine of the dc9 taking the engine off said alan muncaster 
another northwest spokesman that resulted in the fire that at 
this point is all we know 
at the time of the crash visibility was poor and the ground was 
wet from a morning snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at 
detroit metropolitan airport muncaster said the airport had been 
closed to inbound traffic but that planes were being allowed to 
take off 
tony dresden a spokesman for the national air traffic 
controllers association a union representing air traffic 
controllers said there was about a quartermile visibility in the 
air but only about 800 feet on the ground 
weve had some discussions with our people out there 
dresden said the dc9 pilot became lost on the runways the 
pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information about his 
position and turned right onto the runway where the 727 was 
taxiing 
the dc9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he 
was and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off 
that runway but it was too late 
he stressed that his information was preliminary the federal 
aviation administration which supervises air traffic controllers 
did not immediately comment about dresdens statement 
investigators from the national transportation safety board were 
being dispatched to begin a probe aimed at determining the cause of 
the accident a safety board spokesman said 
one survivor from the dc9 41yearold john izzo said he was 
dozing when he heard a bang felt a thud and then all of a 
sudden there was a blast 
i saw the fire to the right rear the whole top burned away 
but something was definitely blown away because something flew over 
my head said izzo a westinghouse nuclear engineer who was 
returning to pittsburgh from a business trip 
izzo said he escaped by jumping from a wing to the ground he 
was not hurt 
the people that made it down and out were crawling through the 
slush into the middle of the field he said i just watched the 
fire spread across the plane and engulf the entire fuselage 
izzo said he was seated in row 10 and believes people in the 
rows behind him could not get out 
the only thing going through my mind was im going to die in 
this damn plane and im only 26 years old said another 
passenger medical student mike marrone of saddle river nj 
i wanted to get out of there and i think a lot of other people 
did too i didnt see too many acts of heroism marrone said 
the body of the 727 did not appear to have been seriously 
damaged in the collision one passenger 60yearold robert karp of 
jackson miss said passengers from the 727 walked off the plane 
and down the stairs 
it sounded to me like it was a loud thump said karp a 
professor at jackson state university 
i thought the tire had blown out the front end of the plane 
had begun to lift off i dont think the back wheels were off the 
ground yet as soon as i heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop 
i remember looking at the other plane and seeing smoke rolling 
out 
three men who earlier had identified themselves as pilots were 
sitting across the aisle from him one of them said oh my god 
our entire wing is gone according to karp 
mcnamara said the only injuries on the boeing were those that 
occurred during the planes evacuation 
muncaster said the dc9s pilot and copilot were injured but 
the pilots of both aircraft were able to provide statements for 
authorities northwest did not reveal what the pilots said 
the 727 wasnt airborne but was on a takeoff roll 
muncaster said but could not estimate how fast it was traveling 
its passengers evacuated through the rear of the plane whose right 
wing was sheared off he said 
linda kalinsky of the taylor ambulance co said there were 50 or 
60 injuries altogether including some burn victims 
twentyone injured were taken to four hospitals in the area 
including two who were taken to the university of michigan medical 
center burn center at ann arbor 
muncaster said surviving passengers were taken to the airport 
marriot hotel where a family center was set up 
as dusk settled in around 4 pm a stand of huge lights were 
wheeled into place near the cockpit of the dc9 on runway 3c to 
allow firefighters and investigators to see 
at about 5 pm rescue workers hoisted body bags from the dc9 
and handed them to others on a wing 
in northwests offices at greater pittsburgh international 
airport 12 to 15 people waited for information on family members 
and friends said bruce nelson director of sales and marketing for 
the airlines pittsburgh office 
they are very quiet nelson said at a news conference 
theyve just been told that were trying to get a passenger list 
and get things in order 
romulus about 10 miles west of detroit was the site of the 
second worst air crash in us history the aug 16 1987 crash of 
a northwest md80on takeoff in which 156 people were killed

rupert murdochs news corp says it hopes to 
reach an agreement with bankers by early january on a new financing 
plan that would defer repayment on about 5 billion in debt for the 
next three years 
the australianbased company has amassed a large debt by 
aggressively expanding into newspapers book publishing movie and 
tv production television stations and magazines 
but unexpectedly slow assets sales economic weakness in britain 
and australia and a sluggish advertising market in the united 
states have made it tough to keep up with debt payments 
murdoch has met over the past few weeks with groups of bankers 
in australia europe and the united states to outline a proposal to 
consolidate about 65 billion in bank loans otherwise due by 
mid1993 
an executive source close to the news corp chief executive but 
speaking on condition of anonymity said nov 29 that murdoch made 
the proposal because principal payments are coming due that the 
company would have trouble paying 
under terms of the proposed package only 14 billion in bank 
loans would have to be repaid by december 1993 the executive said 
the company would then hope to renegotiate the remainder by early 
1994 he said 
in exchange for permitting the debt deferral the bankers would 
get higher rates of interest and other fees the company has also 
told the bankers it plans to sell about 1 billion in assets over 
the next two years 
as part of the refinancing proposal news corp would get a 600 
million bridge loan that would have to be repaid in mid1992 the 
bridge loan would give the company the ability to make interest 
payments meet business expenses and allow extra time to arrange 
asset sales 
news corp purchased the book publisher harper amp row 20th 
century fox film corp several television stations and triangle 
publications the owner of tv guide and the daily racing form in 
the past few years 
under its existing loan agreemnt news corp would have had to 
pay back 24 billion in both bank loans and public debt by next 
june another 14 billion by june 1992 and 3 billion by june 
1993 
the new agreement would require no repayments by next june 12 
billion including the bridge loan by june 1992 and another 800 
million by june 1993 with the chance for delaying the final payment 
until december 1993

that renfrews departure had nothing to do with the companys 
performance this year the agency said it still would have record 
pretax profits of about 627 million even after absorbing 
severance pay worth 196 million 
hogg said renfrew 62 had informed the board 15 months ago of 
his decision to retire after a successor had been picked 
the whole process has been a planned one said hogg who 
paid tribute to renfrew for leading reuters through a period of 
quite outstanding growth and prosperity as chief executive and 
managing director 
hogg said renfrew had already stayed two years beyond the normal 
pensionable age for senior reuters executives mandatory retirement 
is at 65 
neil blackley a media analyst at the brokerage james capel and 
co also said it would be wrong to link reuters recent 
difficulties with renfrews leaving next march 
he had a decade of meteoric profit growth but the last nine 
months have been difficult blackley said its a shame he has 
to end on that note 
blackley said he was pleased with the appointment of job whom 
he described as very talented 
job a graduate of oxford university served as a foreign 
correspondent and news executive in india malaysia indonesia 
britain and latin america before moving into business management in 
1974 he has been head of reuters asia since 1988 
renfrew an australian joined reuters in london in 1952 after 
graduating from sydney university he was in charge of reuters 
north american operations from 1971 until his promotion to chief 
executive in 1981 
when he took over as ceo reuters was owned by a publishers 
association representing newspapers in britian ireland australia 
and new zealand it had 2700 employees then 
renfrew guided reuters through a complicated transformation into 
a public company reuters holdings plc in 1984 in the past five 
years pretax profits have risen steadily with each year setting a 
new record 
renfrew sold 20 percent of his personal holdings in the company 
last august for about 337 million that left him with 849378 
shares worth 1055 million the day his departure was announced

financial news network inc said nov 29 it 
expects to report a 725 million loss for fiscal 1990 
the company whose biggest shareholder is the owner of the 
united press international wire service also said it expects to 
report a loss of 25 million for the first quarter of its current 
fiscal year 
the company has been unable to report its financial results for 
the fiscal year ended june 30 because it replaced its auditing firm 
in a controversy over how fnn was reporting a 28 million 
investment in a new service 
the auditors deloitte amp touche contended the investment should 
have been deducted from quarterly earnings while fnn wanted to 
spread the costs over a few years 
deloitte left as fnns auditor in october and the firm coopers amp 
lybrand was brought in to study the fnn annual financial 
statements 
fnn said that its new auditors had substantially completed 
their examination and said it expects to file its audited 
financial statements with the securities and exchange commission in 
early december 
fnn said the anticipated net loss for he year would leave it 
with a shareholders deficit of approximately 335 million at 
june 30 
the shareholders deficit represents an excess of liabilities 
over assets 
the company said it would probably file amended quarterly 
reports for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to reflect 
material changes deemed appropriate as a result of the audit 
in addition it said it expects to report within a few weeks a 
25 million loss for the first fiscal quarter ended sept 30 
fnn said that more than half of the anticipated losses for the 
year and the first quarter involves elimination of revenues derived 
from affiliated businesses 
the company did not identify the affiliates but it is 46 
percent owned by infotechnology inc which owns upi and an 
assortment of other media and technology companies 
it was disclosed last month that the sec is investigating 
infotechnology for undisclosed reasons infotechnology and fnn have 
each said they do not have enough cash flow to cover operating 
expenses and are negotiating with those to whom they owe money 
in late october alan j hirschfield and allan r tessler were 
brought in to succeed earl brian as interim cochief executives at 
both infotechnology and financial news network 
in early november they said they were putting the companies 
principal operations up for sale including the fnn cable network 
and upi 
in the nov 29 announcement hirschfield and tessler said fnns 
investment banker wertheim amp schroder amp co inc is beginning the 
sale process for fnn 
a substantial number of inquires have been received from a 
broad representation of mediarelated companies and others 
concerning the proposed sale of fnn the statement said 
infotechnology spokeswoman amber gordon said she could not 
identify who was interested or how many inquiries had been 
received she said the company hopes to conclude negotiations of 
the contracts for the sales by the end of the year 
fnn provides stock quotes business and financial news and 
sports information on a cable tv network to more than 35 million 
homes served by 3500 cable systems in the united states and 
canada 
it also operates a business radio network and with 
infotechnology owns 51 percent of the learning channel cable 
network

members of the associated press need to 
reassess how they use their resources and consider reaffirming 
their commitment to the news cooperative the chairmanelect of 
aps board of directors said dec 2 
members of the ap tend to spend a great deal of money sending 
their own reporters to cover major news events rather than use the 
aps coverage said frank a daniels jr president and publisher 
of the news amp observer of raleigh nc 
the instinct that so many of us have is that if we dont cover 
it ourselves it isnt as welldone and that our readers expect 
us to staff certain events daniels told the missouri and kansas 
ap publishers and editors at their annual meeting 
theres a lot of merit in that he said but every time we 
staff an event we have to forego another event or we give up a 
position on the copy desk that might have been able to rewrite a 
story and present more information more clearly by better 
editing 
daniels also urged the group to critique the ap report daily and 
call local bureaus with requests and complaints 
the ap is only as good as you want it to be he said 
lets work harder at using our cooperative complementary skills 
so that our readers benefit from additional news 
no one newspaper or group of newspapers is as strong as the 
cooperative ap none has the financial resources to be devoted to 
gathering news and disseminating it tapping into the creative 
productivity of 1500 newspapers each of which shares its 
reporting through the ap

claims in a 1275 million lawsuit that she was fired because she 
is a lesbian and wrote a freelance story for a gay publication 
julie brienzas lawsuit was filed nov 29 in us district 
court upi and wisconsin voice of christian youth a 
milwaukeebased religious group were named as defendants 
brienza who was upis supreme court reporter alleged that she 
was dismissed under pressure from vic eliason the religious 
groups executive director 
in the suit brienza contends that eliason began a campaign to 
have her fired after she interviewed him on april 10 for a 
freelance article she was writing about the influence of the 
religious right on broadcasting 
the suit alleges that eliason buys news from upi and that he 
contacted upi management to complain about brienza writing for the 
washington blade a news weekly he then urged listeners to his 
radio network to jam upis telephone lines demanding her dismissal 
the suit said 
on april 27 upi fired her accusing her of violating 
freelancing rules 
upi terminated brienzas employment because of her sexual 
orientation and because she was writing a freelance article for a 
gay and lesbian newspaper the suit contends 
upi spokesman milt capps said nov 29 he could not comment on 
the suit until he had seen it but earlier capps had denied that 
brienzas firing was due to pressure from religious broadcasters 
and said it was based on violations of upi work rules 
officials at wisconsin voice of christian youth inc in 
milwaukee did not immediately return a call seeking comment 
the suit seeks 750000 in general damages plus 12 million in 
punitive damages 10 million from eliason and 2 million from 
upi it claims violation of privacy loss of income and violation 
of a district of columbia law that prohibits discrimination in 
employment based on a persons sexual orientation the suit 
contends wisconsins hate crime law also was violated 
besides the 1275 million the suit seeks return of brienzas 
job back pay and a retraction from eliason and his group 
the suit acknowledges that brienza used upis internal message 
system to retrieve information on eliason from the news agencys 
milwaukee bureau and that she made two longdistance phone calls 
for the story from upis washington office 
upi rules according to the suit prohibit employees from 
freelancing on company time doing outside work that could compete 
with upi or writing articles that take an advocacy position 
but brienza said at a news conference that her use of company 
facilities was minimal and that other upi employees routinely did 
the same for personal reasons or for outside work she said the 
blade is not an advocacy publication and that she had gotten 
permission from upi management prior to working on the article 
she said upis actions were out of proportion to the offense and 
that the issue in her firing really was her sexual orientation

the national football league commissioner 
vindicated sports writer lisa olson by imposing 22500 in fines on 
three new england patriots players she accused of sexually taunting 
her in the team locker room 
commissioner paul tagliabue on nov 27 also fined the team 
50000 for being slow to investigate allegations that zeke mowatt 
michael timpson and robert perryman exposed themselves or made lewd 
comments to the boston herald reporter 
mowatt who earlier was fined 2000 by the team was fined 
12500 timpson and perryman were fined 5000 each the fines are 
likely to hurt their reputations more than their bank accounts but 
olson said she accepted the penalties 
my satisfaction with the investigation and subsequent 
sanctions is surpassed only by my wish the disgraceful incident had 
never occurred in the first place she said in a statement 
it was not my choice to have this matter decided in a public 
forum and it is unfortunate that patriot management forced this to 
happen by not dealing with the guilty persons swiftly and 
decisively 
tagliabue agreed saying the team did not adequately 
investigate and resolve a serious incident of misconduct in the 
clubs locker room and appeared to condone the misconduct of the 
patriots players 
the commissioner levied the fines based on a 60page report by 
harvard law professor philip heymann on the sept 17 incident the 
report by heymann as tagliabues special counsel resulted from 
107 interviews with 91 people 
heymann cited discrepancies between the accounts given by olson 
and several players but he said mowatts story was not credible 
and he concluded the reporter suffered sexual taunting by naked 
players 
tagliabue called the players actions completely uncalled for 
and improper mowatts conduct involved both verbal and 
demonstrative actions timpson and perryman encouraged the 
misconduct 
the decision has been rendered now its time to get on with 
playing football patriots owner victor kiam said in a statement 
the penalties are subject to appeal but kiam said the team will 
abide by the decision 
there was no comment immediately afterward from mowatt timpson 
or perryman who is now with the dallas cowboys after being cut by 
new england 
in addition to a 25000 fine for dragging its feet on the 
investigation the club was ordered to pay another 25000 to help 
pay for instructional materials for all 28 nfl teams on how to deal 
with the news media 
the patriots are 111 this season and have not won since the day 
before the incident a few weeks afterward cincinnati bengals 
coach sam wyche barred a woman reporter from the locker room 
tagliabue fined him more than 27000

executives from the recordjournal of 
meriden the hartford courant and the new haven register said they 
plan to fight on constitutional grounds a directive that bans news 
racks from city sidewalks 
city officials began notifying area newspapers nov 29 that the 
vending machines had to be removed from sidewalks and certain other 
locations 
a onesentence section of a local zoning ordinance prohibits 
placement of vending machines between a city street and a property 
line effectively banning them from city sidewalks it also 
requires machines on private property to be a certain distance from 
the street although that distance varies depending on the areas 
zone designation 
but newspaper officials said numerous court cases including a 
1988 us supreme court decision have upheld newspapers first 
amendment right to maintain the machines 
a letter mailed to the three newspapers said their machines have 
to be removed within 30 days if they are not ceaseanddesist 
orders will be issued and the city will begin enforcement actions 
city planner dominick j caruso said he said the same letter will 
go out to other newspapers that own vending machines in the city 
but city manager michael h aldi later said he believes the 
ordinance may be unconstitutional and that intends to seek a legal 
opinion to resolve the issue 
caruso said the regulation has been on the books for a long 
time its just never been brought up before caruso said he was 
unaware of the law until recently when he received a complaint 
eliot c white publisher of the recordjournal and president of 
the recordjournal publishing co said the matter revolves around 
an outofdate ordinance thats never been enforced as far as we 
know 
the recordjournal maintains 50 vending machines in the city 
in a 1988 case the supreme court ruled that a lakewood ohio 
official could not prevent a cleveland newspaper from putting out 
news racks by denying them a permit to do so according to alice 
neff lucan a washington dc attorney who has handled similar 
cases 
it is extremely unlikely in my opinion that just by coloring 
this a vending machine issue they can prevent newspapers from 
distributing said neff lucan who represents usa today which 
owns machines in the city the distribution and publication of 
newspapers is protected by the free speech provisions of the first 
amendment she said 
william j rush chief executive officer of the new haven 
register said he has seen municipalities try to outlaw news racks 
its always boiled down to our constitutional rights under the 
first amendment he said we try to be good citizens but we 
intend to keep our boxes on the street and we intend to protect our 
constitutional rights 
the register has about 35 machines in meriden 
raymond a jansen publisher of the hartford courant said his 
paper has encountered this a number of times over the years and 
we typically try to work with city officials to position the 
machines where theyd like to see them 
but if it comes down to not allowing them wed view that very 
seriously jansen said we would seek legal advice as to how 
the law could be enforced in the face of the first amendment

the manager of a shopping mall that 
banned newspaper racks changed his mind nov 26 after hearing 
complaints from several publications including a black weekly 
madison square mall manager joe black said the issue had been 
blown out of proportion editor william smothers of the weekly 
speakin out news who complained that banning the racks amounted 
to censorship speculated that the policy was reversed to protect 
the malls image 
black said he became concerned about the number of newspaper 
racks and the lack of maintenance of them last year he had some 
removed and then all of them to avoid the appearance of 
favoritism 
we thought this thing had been blown way out of proportion and 
it was not deserving black said after deciding to allow the 
racks back we thought it was time for the community to focus on 
things more important to huntsville

the war on drugs has taken a new twist in nearby 
new bedford the local newspaper teamed with the chief of police 
and a top judge has begun printing the mug shots of every person 
arrested on drug charges 
this newspaper has escalated the importance of crime news 
relating to drugs editor james ragsdale wrote in the 
standardtimes 
we are now saying that photographing those accused of 
drugrelated crime is as important as for homicides manslaughter 
arson and the rest 
although many newspapers run the names of people arrested for 
various crimes and some print the names of men charged with hiring 
prostitutes ragsdale believes that publishing the pictures of drug 
suspects is entirely new 
this is just one of the many things this newspaper is doing to 
raise public awareness that there is a drug problem he said 
titled drug watch the daily column begun nov 15 requires 
one staff photographer and up to 30 inches of newsprint a recent 
edition carried photos of nine men ranging in age from 17 to 39 
arrested for possession of various drugs possession with intent to 
distribute and conspiracy to violate drug laws 
mayor john bullard praised the papers efforts he said new 
bedfords drug problem and related crime are overwhelming more 
than 2000 drug arrests were made in new bedford in the first 10 
months of 1990 
bullard acknowledged that publishing photos may not prevent 
hardcore drug use 
but for those people who buy drugs and think they can stay 
undercover this should be a deterrent he said tuesday 
reaction to drug watch has been varied with many local 
officials and residents applauding the attempt and some journalists 
and lawyers questioning the ethics involved 
sarah wunsch a lawyer for the massachusetts civil liberties 
union called the policy sensationalistic she and others said the 
publication of pictures threatens a defendants right to a fair 
trial 
ragsdale said his newspaper will make every effort to print the 
outcome of each court hearing even if that happens months or years 
after initial publication

gov george deukmejian angered at a column in 
the san francisco examiner has rejected the papers request for a 
oneonone interview but granted personal interviews to other 
newspapers including the examiners competitor 
bob gore a spokesman for the republcan governor acknowledged 
nov 27 that deukmejian was angered by an oct 1 column by writer 
bill mandel who criticized the governors fiscal policies relating 
to health care and social programs the column appeared under the 
headline hell is too good for deukmejian 
it went beyond fair comment gore said when asked why the 
interview request had been denied i think if you read your 
editorial page lately you might figure out why you are in the 
second round of interviews 
the examiner has been offered a group interview with the 
governor along with the associated press gannett news service 
the political pulse a sacramentobased political newsletter and 
united press international 
three newspapers have been given oneonone interviews the san 
francisco chronicle the san diego tribune and the los angeles 
times 
those represent the three major urban areas in the state 
gore said among those that were denied personal interviews were 
the san jose mercury news the san diego union and the sacramento 
bee 
frank mcculloch the examiners managing editor said it 
appeared the governor had made a decision on access based upon a 
newspapers editorial comment the columns and editorials have 
nothing to do with the news columns no one on the editorial page 
has any authority over the news columns he said 
mcculloch added that newspaper columnists are constrained only 
by their by broad good taste which is pretty hard to measure 
anyway the refusal to allow a oneonone interview may not be 
all that serious but in this competitive world its a 
disadvantage

the kentucky supreme court has upheld a

175000 jury award to campbell commonwealths attorney louis a 
ball for compensatory damages from the newspaper reporter al 
salvato and the ew scripps co which owns the post no punitive 
damages were awarded 
the newspaper published frontpage stories on nov 17 and 19 
1984 titled portrait of a prosecutor outlining what the paper 
said was balls poor record as prosecutor 
included was a comment from a former narcotics officer who said 
criminals couldnt have a better friend than ball 
the courts ruling said there was ample evidence the newspaper 
printed erroneous material that it knew was wrong or made 
insufficient effort to determine if it was wrong 
the circumstances surrounding the newspapers reporting and 
publishing of the story all led to the conclusion the articles were 
printed maliciously the court said 
we include in the circumstances surrounding publication the 
way in which the articles were laid out the evidence regarding 
malice and the failure to make any retraction justice 
charles leibson said in the opinion 
kentucky post editor judith clabes called the ruling gravely 
disappointing 
its an unbecoming decision from a political body that has 
demonstrated in a number of instances that when it comes to the 
press politics and emotions are more controlling than the law 
she said 
the court completely ignored the facts of the case and 
misrepresented the facts of the case clabes said

new yorks top court ruled nov 27 that 
regents disciplinary hearings involving doctors and other 
professionals should be closed to the public unless those accused 
of misconduct want them open

newspaper corp publisher of the watertown daily times which had 
argued that hearings conducted by the state board of regents should 
be open

veteranarians traditionally the regents have kept their 
misconduct cases against professionals confidential until they 
decide a persons guilt or innocence said christopher carpenter 
state education department spokesman 
the daily times in april 1988 sought access to a disciplinary 
hearing involving a watertown dentist that hearing has been held

set aside pending the outcome of the foundations appeal to the 
supreme court 
foundation attorney hoover blanton said the foi law should not 
apply to a private group unless a large amount of the groups

cbs inc is considering a share repurchase 
program following the disclosure that it expects a fourthquarter 
loss and lower earnings next year a published report said 
the media companys stock fell after the nov 19 earnings 
forecast although it gained ground later along with other media 
stocks 
the wall street journal said nov 29 that people familiar with 
the proposal said cbs is considering a socalled dutch auction as 
one share buyback option 
in a dutch auction a company states the number of shares it 
wants to buy in a specified period and gives a price range within 
which shareholders may tender their shares the company then 
selects a price in the range that will enable it to buy all the 
shares it needs 
that might enable cbs to buy back part or all of the 8 percent 
stake held by the estate of the late cbs founder william s paley 
paleys shares are to be divided among his six children but may 
have to be sold to cover tax obligations 
cbs had no immediate comment on the report 
in the earnings forecast cbs said it expected to post a loss in 
the fourth quarter compared with earnings of about 60 million in 
the same period a year ago because of losses at its cbs television 
network 
cbs has only posted one other quarterly loss from continuing 
operations in its history and that was 20 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1986 
the company also said it expects its earnings from continuing 
operations in 1991 will be down from this year because of a weak ad 
climate and rising costs for entertainment programs and sports 
rights

washington apple growers are suing cbs and 
an environmental group over a 60 minutes report they say 
damaged their livelihood by creating a scare about the growth 
chemical alar 
in a separate dispute in youngstown ohio college students and 
the head of a local public relations firm plan to send a form 
letter to newspapers across the country claiming another segment 
on the show inaccurately portrayed their city 
the alar lawsuit filed nov 28 in state court seeks 
unspecified damages running to millions of dollars for losses it 
said were caused by the programs false misleading 
scientifically unreliable statements 
the industry has estimated growers lost more than 100 million 
following the 1989 broadcast which was based on a report by the 
natural resources defense council a consumer group 
we believe the broadcast highlighted an important public 
health matter said roy brunett spokesman for 60 minutes 
it was well researched and well documented and we expect a 
lawsuit to be dismissed 
the washington dcbased consumer group said it stood behind 
the report 
the youngstown dispute concerns a nov 11 segment featuring an 
interview with us rep james traficant who expressed concern for 
the citys economy correspondent morley safer described the city 
as practically an industrial ghost town 
vic rubenstein president of the public relations firm 
rubenstein associates said the citys letterwriting campaign was 
intended to correct what he said was a misconception 
the letter said youngstown has made a comeback although there 
is still lingering pain caused by the closing of our steel mills 
we have recovered far better than so many communities of like 
circumstances it said 
rubenstein said the letters signed by a dozen caring 
youngstown state university students should reach about 1500 
newspapers 
brunett said the segment was accurate and was not intended to 
insult anyone

its been two years since pan am flight 103 
rained down on the scottish countryside the lawsuits still are 
winding their way through the courts the investigations continue 
and on sunday comes a britishamerican docudrama quite unlike its 
stateside cousins 
the tragedy of flight 103 the inside story contains no 
oncamera crash no grieving relatives no buckets of tears 
this docudrama coproduced by britains granada television and 
the united states home box office is an investigative effort that 
serves as an indictment of pan am security measures at its 
frankfurt terminal 
flight 103 which originated in frankfurt exploded over the 
scotland village of lockerbie on dec 21 1988 as it turned toward 
new york on the final leg of its trip all 259 passengers and crew 
as well as 11 townspeople were killed 
officials of pan am depicted as corporate moguls more concerned 
with public image than protecting passengers have their own view 
of the films findings 
outright fabrications is one an attempt to exploit the 
tragedy without regard to the facts is another 
a us presidential commission on aviation security and 
terrorism investigated the crash and came up with its own 
conclusions in may one much of the blame belonged to inept and 
confused pan am security personnel another the destruction of 
flight 103 may well have been preventable 
the 90minute docudrama which stars ned beatty peter boyle 
vincent gardenia timothy west and michael wincott is culled from 
more than 40 interviews with former pan am safety officials and 
police officers and reviews of internal memos government documents 
and regulatory reports 
it recreates damning conversations between former pan am 
chairman c edward acker and the airlines newly hired security 
expert fred ford alleges serious security flaws at pan ams 
frankfurt terminal and suggests the terrorist blast could have 
been avoided if pan am had paid greater heed to intelligence 
reports warning of such a bombing 
the program is not the first television treatment of the 
lockerbie crash 
connie chung and the pbs documentary series frontline also 
looked at the tragedy which has spawned allegations of coverups 
against pan am and the us government as well as a voluminous 
lawsuit filed by the victims families alleging willful misconduct 
by the airline in allowing the bomb placed in a radiocassette 
player and packed inside a suitcase on flight 103 
granada and hbo claim the docudrama which debuted in britain on 
nov 26 ande premieres on hbo at 9 pm sunday is the most 
comprehensive television investigation of the bombing 
it also is not the first collaboration between granada 
television and hbo in august of last year a joint production 
examined the fatal soviet attack on a korean air line jet in 
tailspin behind the kal tragedy 
earlier this year hbo aired granadas the investigation 
inside a terrorist bombing which created an uproar in england by 
concluding that six irish men given life sentences for the 1974 
bombings of two birmingham pubs which killed 21 people and wounded 
162 others were innocent 
the lockerbie crash docudrama likewise pulls no punches 
struggling to boost air travel after the us bombing of libya 
and the american downing of an iranian airbus pan am announced an 
unprecedented security system designed to offer greater protection 
from terrorist retaliation 
among the allegations in the granadahbo docudrama 
a new york press conference staged by pan am to introduce its 
new alert security system actually was a farce featuring 
bombsniffing canines bought the day before from a regular kennel 
and guards who sported fake guns 
a 5perpassenger international surcharge levied by pan am to 
pay for the new security measures instead went to the airlines 
corporate account 
the xray operator on duty the day the bombladen suitcase 
made it onto flight 103 had only one days training 
pan ams colorized xray machine which unlike blackandwhite 
models can detect plastic explosives was not working the day the 
radiocassette and its plastic explosive device was loaded on the 
doomed flight 
jeff kriendler pan ams vice president of corporate 
communications said the allegations represent a reckless 
disregard of the facts 
there was no color xray machine in place at the time kriendler 
said it was on order he said 
at the new york press conference kriendler said there were 
no guns the dogs were sniffer dogs he said but they may 
have been there more for security purposes i dont know where they 
came from 
the 5 surcharge funds were directly used for security measures 
he said and the xray operator on duty the day of the bombing had 
several days experience kriendler said 
kriendler declined to say whether pan am planned legal action 
against hbo and granada 
said bridget potter hbos senior vice president of original 
programming i think my response would be look at the film the 
film speaks for itself 
 
elsewhere in television 
the simpsons sing sort of the simpsons sing the blues was 
released this week on geffen records badboy bart and dad homer 
mom marge sister lisa and a few friends bb king among them 
warble their way through born under a bad sign and look at 
all those idiots

as the possibility of war looms in the persian 
gulf debate is being renewed over whether the allvolunteer force 
unfairly excuses the elite while the poor and black face the 
fighting and dying some say a draft would be more fair 
fewer families are giving more and more says former 
secretary of the navy james h webb 
caspar w weinberger secretary of defense during most of the 
reagan administration scoffed at such criticism in an interview 
what do we want asked weinberger do we want a 
sociological experiment or do we want the best military we can 
get 
if you force into the military people who dont want to be 
there you are going to have the whole vietnam scene played all 
over again with people wandering up and down the streets with 
signs and people who never want us to participate in any kind of 
action he said 
r paul churchill an associate professor of philosophy at 
george washington university said much the same thing from an 
entirely different perspective 
churchill a veteran of protest movements who teaches a course 
in war and morality said he hasnt completely made up his mind 
about the issue but added we witnessed during the vietnam war 
how threatened a nation that depends on conscription can be by the 
apparent willingness of young men to tolerate a great deal of 
trouble to avoid a draft 
webb a vietnam veteran with three nephews in enlisted ranks 
has been one of the strongest critics 
the elites have excused themselves out of military service 
beginning with vietnam and its more so now than when we had a 
draft webb told the washington times in a recent interview 
almost without exception no washington dinner party guest 
liberal or conservative democrat or republican personally knows 
a single one of the 18 million enlisted americans serving in our 
armed forces syndicated columnist mark shields wrote recently 
the capitol hill newspaper roll call surveying the 535 members 
of congress to find those with children serving in operation desert 
shield found two both rep jerry costello dill and rep kika 
de la garza dtexas said they did not know when their sons would 
return home both also said they have supported president bush so 
far in his deployment of troops 
selective service records show that 1767556 young men were 
drafted during the vietnam war counting from july 1 1964 through 
june 30 1973 most went into the army in 1966 for instance the 
army took 366000 and the marine corps 15500 other services 
received only a few 
when the draft was discontinued in 1973 sens sam nunn of 
georgia and ernest hollings of south carolina protested that the 
action could lead to a largely poor largely minority force 
neither nunn now chairman of the senate armed services 
committee nor hollings could be reached for an interview nunns 
press secretary scott williams said he may have had 
reservations back then but i think he would say now the force is 
excellent 
lawrence j korb an assistant secretary of defense for manpower 
in the reagan administration and now a senior fellow with the 
brookings institution said militarily it is the best force we 
have ever had in terms of equity it is at least as fair and 
probably fairer than the draft you had in vietnam 
you forced the lower class to go in whether they wanted to or 
not and offered them very little benefits korb said these 
kids were dragged off the street given a few months training and 
sent over there 
meanwhile he said college deferments and other loophles 
provided the affluent with a system that you could drive a truck 
through to get out of service 
the pentagon says recruits now receive an average of a years 
training before joining their units 
congressional and pentagon studies show that blacks are 
disproportionately represented among recruits but say the force is 
more representative of the population than its critics have 
suggested 
in 1987 almost 20 percent of recruits signing up with the 
military for the first time were black according to a study issued 
in october by the congressional budget office about 15 percent of 
youths of enlistment age are black 
the study said that about 55 percent of male activeduty 
recruits that year came from zip code areas where average family 
income was in the bottom half nationally 
lowermiddleincome areas were most heavily represented the 
very bottom of the distribution was only slightly 
overrepresented the study said areas in the top tenth of the 
income distribution provided only about 6 percent of recruits but 
even in the highestincome areas in the country some young people 
enlisted 
a defense department study issued in july gave similar figures 
reporting that 23 percent of the active duty enlisted force in 
fiscal year 1989 was black compared with 12 percent to 14 percent 
of civilians of comparable age 
today enlisted recruits are not drawn primarily from an 
underclass as they are sometimes thought to be said the report 
survey data indicate that the great majority of recruits parents 
are married own their own homes and are employed 
the report said that by a common measurement of socioeconomic 
status the parents of recruits came out ninetenths as well as a 
comparison group of parents of youth in the general population 
weinberger dismissed the argument that the force is 
unrepresentative as absurd and basically imbecilic and 
insulting in the highest degree 
if you really want a definition of a racist he said it 
seems to me that the critics of this system are the people who are 
the most racist in the country are we criticizing the black 
population because so many of them want to be in the military 
gen colin l powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
who is black told the washington post recently i dont think 
its disproportionate or wrong i think its a choice the american 
people made when they said have a volunteer army and allow those 
who want to serve to serve

the dow jones industrial average which measures 
bluechip performance is down about 7 percent this year but the 
nasdaq composite made up of smaller companies has fallen nearly 
three times that figure 
so what happened to the socalled small firm effect which 
states that in a period of several years smaller stocks tend to 
outpace larger ones just wait say its believers but weve been 
waiting for years say the doubters 
indeed they have during six of the past seven years the larger 
stocks as measured by the standard amp poors 500 index have 
outperformed the smaller ones and between midjuly and 
midnovember the little ones plunged 28 percent 
these figures from mathematician and investment adviser gerald 
w perritt have tested the faith of many a smallstock investor 
nothing tests a theory like reality they say and the reality has 
been very very poor 
has the smallfirm effect gone the way of the dodo bird 
asks perritt in his newsletter investment horizon the 
question is rhetorical perritt a former professor is one of the 
worlds foremost proponents of the theory 
briefly it works on a variety of assumptions one being that 
good smaller companies grow faster than good large ones in part 
because they are managed more entrepreneurially their percentage 
growth can be much larger than that of big companies and as they 
grow the investment funds tend to climb aboard 
little has changed since the effect was discovered in the late 
1970s he says except you might say the recent performance 
measurements 
a realist perritt sees even lower prices with the economy on 
the verge of a recession he says it is likely that the prices 
of stocks in general and small firm stocks in particular will 
head even lower 
but ever faithful to the smallfirm thesis he then sees the 
little ones outracing the lumbering giants for these among other 
reasons 
the stocks of these companies equity capitalizations below 
100 million have suffered from such severe neglect theyre 
selling at priceearnings multiples not seen since the bottom of 
the 19731974 recession 
while their prices have been hurt their sales continue to 
expand at a rate nearly twice those of companies in the standard amp 
poors 500stock index 
the january effect perritts research suggests that smaller 
stocks have a propensity to deliver large returns during the month 
of january because of this years declines he says that effect 
could be more pronounced than usual 
smallcompany stock prices tend to soar during the year or two 
following a severe recessioninduced bear market 
brokers and independent security analysts are beginning to 
recommend purchase of solid smallcapitalization stocks to their 
clients 
he believes that once the bear market has run its course 
probably bringing even lower prices to some of the smallcap stocks 
buyers will begin to accumulate shares 
and he concludes given the lack of liquidity in this sector of 
the market a marginal increase in buying interest will send the 
prices of these stocks soaring 
no says perritt again the smallfirm effect isnt defunct like 
the dodo bird more like the phoenix rising from the ashes he 
says

the people who run winterthur museum 
feel the nations premier collection of american furniture and 
decorative arts hasnt gotten the audience it deserves and they 
blame the institution itself 
they say the sheer size of the immense collection and the 
imposing surroundings of a former du pont manor are intimidating to 
many people the ninestory 150yearold country house set on a 
985acre estate contains 89000 pieces displayed in 196 period 
room settings 
museumgoers also have been encouraged to make advance 
reservations for tours of the collection and for most of its 39 
years winterthur never tried to reach out for a broad audience 
the museums directors began changing direction in the 
mid1980s theyre stressing programs for children to attract more 
families and theyre planning a new hall to house a smaller more 
digestible exhibition of the musuems americana pieces 
why the new approach 
because it wasnt felt it was necessary said thomas a 
graves jr the museums executive director it was perfectly all 
right to kep winterthur exactly the way it was which was 
wonderful 
the collection itself is absolutely extraordinary but we the 
trustees felt the time had come that in order for us to really 
thrive and be of service in the future we were going to have to 
open up and expand 
the changes have meant winterthur had to join its museum 
brethern in fund raising seeking aggressively for the first time 
to tap revenue sources like corporations and federal and private 
grants 
the changes also meant being more businesslike 
graves 66 who was hired in 1985 after 14 years as president of 
the college of william and mary in virginia said winterthur lacked 
normal business management practices and controls on spending 
winterthur was not in trouble financially but it was clear 
we didnt have good control over our costs personnel and security 
we were just sort of here we had to establish ourselves as a 
firstrate business enterprise if were going to be firstrate in 
the future graves said 
before it started fund raising winterthur operated comfortably 
off the income from its 150 million endowment left by its founder 
the late henry francis du pont which made it one of the richest 
museums in the country 
the endowment now generates about 71 million in income a year 
providing about 54 percent of the museums 13 million operating 
budget 
winterthurs first fundraising campaign started in december 
1988 seeking to raise 19 million for the new exhibition hall 
about 123 million has been raised so far and the building is 
scheduled to open in the spring of 1992 
the new hall will be a traditional museum where objects are 
displayed as if in an art gallery 
this is an extraordinary place and when you have this kind of 
a treasure i think we have an obligation to share it with as many 
people and families as we possibly can and thats what were in 
the process of doing graves said 
a 450000 grant came from mcdonalds for the hall to house an 
expanded version of the museums touch it room for children 
the exhibit lets kids dress up in old clothes and pick up and 
examine objects from the collection 
in an effort to make itself better known the museum has sent 
its catalog to 8 million people and it recently began participating 
in furniture trade shows displaying reproductions of its 
collection it also opened a store sept 22 in alexandria va to 
sell reproductions from the collection 
weve been doing a lot of promotions with groups specifically 
and weve been doing a lot of internal staff training sensitivity 
training to realize that we need to be very aware of what our 
visitors know and dont know about decorative arts said peter h 
hammell director of museum and public programs 
he said the effort is paying off in higher attendance in the 
first 10 months of the year 132340 people had visited winterthur 
for tours and special programs an increase of 16 percent from the 
same period last year 
what were seeing i hope is people will give us a chance 
its a whole changing of our image in the community hammell 
said 
the move to make winterthur more accessible is part of a 
national trend said edward h able executive director of the 
american associaton of museums in washington 
museums are serving broader populations and hiring culturally 
diverse staffs and boards museums are making sure exhibitions 
are understandable to and enjoyable by wider populations able 
said 
marvin d schwartz a lecturer at the metropolitan museum of art 
in new york said winterthurs collection is unrivaled 
the american wing at the met and the collection at the museum of 
fine arts in boston have some wonderful objects but i dont 
think it is quite as varied as winterthurs he said 
a number of other museums have american rooms and american 
sections but no place but winterthur has it all

duran duran where did they go did they leave 
planet earth 
no theyre globetrotting new york los angeles toronto 
singapore malaysia to promote liberty their latest and 
first album as a new fivesome joining the 10year veteran members 
simon le bon john taylor and nick rhodes are guitarist warren 
cuccurullo and drummer sterling campbell 
in a recent interview the band was as eager to talk as the 
teenage girls waiting outside the hotel were to meet them 
aside from the title liberty has no concept musically or 
lyrically but le bon believes its a statement of duran durans 
new identity with the extra input from campbell and cuccurullo 
the band has been energized 
we dont feel confined which is relevant to the album said 
le bon i think thats why we call it liberty 
he adds however that duran duran is not trying to repackage 
themselves they remain similarly true to their unique modern 
rock musical style and disjointed lyrical imagery 
with the departure of original band members roger taylor and 
andy taylor five years ago none of the taylors are related duran 
duran went through an identity crisis john taylor and andy taylor 
splintered off to join the power station with robert palmer while 
le bon rhodes and roger taylor formed arcadia about a year later 
le bon rhodes and jhn taylor regrouped after learning they didnt 
want to do separate projects 
le bon summed up their realization i wanted to do things that 
i could do in arcadia and power station but i want to do them in 
duran duran this is better than anything we can do ourselves 
the three continued to produce albums as duran duran touring 
with temporary musicians 
we werent in any hurry to replace andy and roger permanently 
purely for the reason we knew the chemistry had to be right said 
rhodes who plays keyboards 
along came cuccurullos tape in 1986 and a note saying im 
your new guitarist the core members liked what they heard and 
took him on for the notorious tour keeping him as a permanent 
member thereafter cuccurullo knew it was meant to be even sooner 
i always thought that if i had been in birmingham in 1978 and 
went to the audition i wouldve been in their band said 
cuccurullo who grew up in brooklyn he has played with frank zappa 
and formed missing persons 
campbell had been playing with cyndi lauper and the band so 
before being introduced to duran duran around 1989 the drummer 
joined them for the big thing tour and when that was over 
they knew this was the way it should be 
le bon described their spontaneous musical process in the 
studio its like a jungle of sound and the best idea is the 
strongest and the one that grows the tallest and everything starts 
to naturally spiral around that 
since the british bands explosion into the music and music 
television scene 10 years ago duran duran has made eight albums 
producing hit songs such as planet earth rio hungry 
like the wolf and reflex their theme song to james bonds 
movie a view to a kill was the first bond theme to top the 
charts 
the groups first song release off liberty was violence 
of summer the second song released was serious 
with all their creative juices flowing duran duran said the 
time isnt right for a tour theyre anxious to get back to the 
studio by the end of the year to work on another album 
i was just listening to a tape the other day and in a 
twohour period of music i heard eight different separate song 
ideas that came from warrens said taylor and three of them 
turned into songs on the album 
i always thought id be in a band with joey billy and vinnie 
and all these guys i played with in brooklyn said cuccurullo 
that was all that mattered to us was that group we didnt want 
to go to school we just wanted to do gigs and play and write songs 
and do stones covers

the mossy gloom of the graveyard the 
wild beauty of the moor beyond recall the village charlotte bronte 
described as such a lonely spot buried away from the world 
the view from the parsonage parlor where anne emily and 
charlotte wrote their books by candlelight is as somber as ever 
but down the path past the black bull pub where their brother 
branwell sought nightly oblivion is a street for other times 
the steep thoroughfare is a succession of garish temptations 
postcards yorkshire fudge the jane aire hairdressers the bronte 
bookshop for the 200000 visitors who come every year to visit 
the parsonage and tread the moor forever associated with 
wuthering heights 
simply by their numbers pilgrims are damaging the house and its 
contents including the brontes cradle the sofa on which emily 
died and charlottes tiny shoes and mitts 
the bronte society has proposed building an extension to the 
parsonage to cope with the crowds and purists are aghast 
people in america and australia save up for a lifetime to 
visit here and they will find it very distressing to come all this 
way and find an enormous center which has completely lost its 
atmosphere says chris sumner membership chairman of the bronte 
society 
the societys plans she feels would destroy the tranquility 
and the dignity of the parsonage 
sheltered in her parsonage office from the icy wind and 
threatening clouds blowing across the moor jane sellars curator 
of the bronte parsonage museum said recently that the choice is 
between building an extension or closing the house to visitors 
it is the fabric of the house and the objects in it that we 
are concerned about the visitors affect the environment in which 
we keep irreplaceable objects the objectors have an emotional 
response that does not understand that a museum has to be 
accessible to people sellars said 
robert barnard a bronte society member complains that the 
addition would dwarf the parsonage and make it a minor component 
in a bronte theme park 
and secondly the style of the building is hideously out of 
tune with a late georgian house i call it neonorman fortress 
style with its little round windows that look like youre going to 
pour boiling oil out of them barnard said in an interview 
opponents say the extension will cut off the parsonage from the 
starkly beautiful yorkshire moors where the sisters found 
inspiration on walks over the stubbly heather in their long narrow 
shoes 
sellars said the extension would improve the flow of visitors 
through the house and provide better control of the temperature 
and humidity 
traffic clogs to a halt and some furniture is getting brushed 
against which should really be screened off she said 
barnard says the extension is no answer to the problem of wear 
and tear inside the parsonage you still have the same number of 
rooms he said 
the architects plans for the 25 million extension would not 
change the frontal view of the parsonage there would be space for 
an enlarged bronte family history exhibition a meeting room and an 
area for scholars 
sellars said the more than 200 bronte scholars who come each 
year to study the primary sources and manuscripts have to work 
inside the museums small library alongside the societys two 
librarians and their computers and telephones 
the bronte society is a literary society that should be a 
learned society she said the visitors are just shunted 
through the house and then moved on we should be teaching more 
about the literature and the place 
the extension if approved by the bradford county council would 
be built of grit stone and in the vernacular style of the village 
its not like were going to put up a steelmass skyscraper 
sellars said 
opponents have suggested building an addition some distance from 
the parsonage which became a museum in 1928 or even underground 
bronte enthusiasts can take a bit of bad weather we can walk 
outside to get to our meeting room barnard said 
michael steed chairman of the 3240member bronte society said 
the underground addition had not been considered i find it hard 
to believe that visitors coming to haworth would find going into an 
underground museum at all attractive 
barnard said the publicityshy brontes who wrote under 
pseudonyms would have loathed the row over the parsonage indeed 
they would have hated the whole business of people tromping 
through their house because in charlottes time they did come to 
haworth and gawk at where the author of jane eyre lived 
charlotte wrote three other novels and left a fourth unfinished 
born in 1816 she died in 1855 is buried in the church opposite the 
parsonage beside emily 18181848 who wrote wuthering 
heights 
anne 18201849 author of agnes grey and the tenant of 
wildfell hall is buried far away in the coastal town of 
scarborough where she died

a united states senator was shouting 
accusations at robert s bennett when the special ethics counsel 
began to fidget in his black swivel chair 
sen dennis deconcini was good and mad gesturing vividly while 
he complained that bennett was out to get him and the other 
socalled keating five 
bennett squirmed in his seat while deconcini hurled accusations 
bennett was personally trying to write new standards of conduct for 
the senate bennett was no longer a independent investigator but a 
prosecutor who wanted the five senators as a trophy 
finally the senator sat down the senate ethics committee 
hearing room was quiet as the stocky attorney rose to speak in 
rebuttal 
these are not my standards bennett said speaking directly 
to the committee with a forceful voice but not hurrying his words 
and just because you cant go to the government printing office 
and say hey give me the ethical standard that covers all 
situations doesnt mean they dont exist gentlemen youre a lot 
better than that 
while many lawyers hired by congress to conduct a highly visible 
investigation may show great reverence to us senators bennett is 
not one of them he is not intimidated by the committee members who 
hired him or the lawmakers he was brought in to investigate 
bennett 51 is known for his straightforward even blunt 
speech 
he is a nononsense litigator who has a way of getting across 
to a whole spectrum of different people said peter p mullen 
executive partner of the 1100lawyer new yorkbased firm of 
skadden arps slate meagher and flom which hired bennett this 
year he can talk to princes and paupers kings and the 
homeless 
bennetts expertise is in defending businessmen accused of white 
collar crimes mullen said his firm scoured the country before 
hiring him to head its white collar practice by the time the deal 
was completed bennett had brought along from his former firm 14 
other lawyers three legal assistants and four secretaries 
the ethics committee also could point to bennetts experience 
when he was hired a year ago to investigate sens deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz donald w riegle jr dmich john 
glenn dohio and alan cranston dcalif the five intervened with 
thrift regulators on behalf of former sampl owner charles h keating 
jr a political contributor 
bennett was special counsel in the investigation of sen dave 
durenberger rminn who the senate denounced earlier this year 
for financial misconduct 
and he performed the same role in the case of former sen 
harrison a williams jr dnj who quit the senate in 1982 just 
as the chamber was about to expel him for bribery 
bennetts response to deconcini in the opening days of the 
ongoing ethics committee hearing told a lot about himself 
he told the committee the only trophy he wanted was the one he 
already had in the wall of his office which also has a panoramic 
view of the washington monument and environs 
the trophy is a stuffed 5pound 2ounce brown trout he caught 
in 1985 underneath the fish is a saying that bennett shows clients 
in hopes theyll heed the advice if i had kept my mouth shut i 
wouldnt be here 
and he reminded the committee that many senate standards of 
conduct were not written by him but by former sen paul douglas of 
illinois in 1951 when bennett was growing up in brooklyn and only 
interested in the dodgers 
bennetts rebuttal also mentioned his three teenage daughters 
to make the point that even the school they attended has standards 
of conduct 
whenever i have a case i feel is important i always work my 
daughters in bennett said later its just something to make 
them feel good to let them know im thinking about them 
sitting in his office for an interview bennett remembered 
that he may be focused on his work now but once was more 
interested in cutting school to watch games at old ebbitts field 
one day i was yelling come on pee wee reese and i felt a 
hand on my shoulder it was my father bennett said who had been 
tipped off by a friend that his son was at the ballpark 
bennetts father a banker officer expressed his displeasure 
that day but now bennett says i have one request for this 
story mention my father f robert bennett 
bennett is not the only highprofile member of his family 
younger brother william is incoming chairman of the republican 
national committee formerly the national drug czar and a secretary 
of education robert bennett though says hes strictly 
nonpolitical 
a favorite hobby is fishing for brown trout in montana and a 
year ago bennett bought a home near livingston along the 
yellowstone river 
bob is a good spin fisherman but now hes trying to become a 
good fly fisherman said bennetts pal lenny gregrey of 
livingston a retired new york city police lieutenant 
his only frustration is he cant tie knots his fingers wont 
work i gave him a written test and he got all flustered gregrey 
said of his usually unflappable friend 
he was sweating over the questions

editors note fifty years ago adolf hitler decided to take his 
biggest gamble of world war ii the invasion of the soviet union 
it was an action that helped lead to the collapse of the third 
reich and left the soviet union in control of eastern europe all 
the way to the elbe river in central germany heres a 
retrospective on what was going on in berlin and moscow during 
those crucial months before the invasion 
</TEXT>

warped by furies as twisted as his swastika adolf hitler on 
dec 18 1940 signed directive 21 
it was topmost secret only nine copies were issued 
at first it had been innocently codenamed fritz then aufbau 
ost buildup east finally case barbarossa 
barbarossa red beard was the nickname of frederick i a holy 
roman emperor who drowned in 1190 leading the third crusade a folk 
myth grew up frederick was actually in seclusion in a cave on 
kyffhauser mountain in central germany some day he would emerge to 
lead a german conquest of europe 
case barbarossa was hitlers equivalent the invasion of the 
soviet union it was in retrospect a mad gamble it guaranteed 
that germany would have to fight on two fronts a burden that in 
due course crushed hitlers third reich 
barbarossa ultimately also spawned another war the cold one 
europe became encased in an iron curtain as soviet armies repulsed 
hitlers invasion and drove his wehrmacht westward to its 
destruction one menace bequeathed the battleground to another the 
soviet union 
after postponements barbarossa was scheduled for june 22 1941 
napoleon commenced his disastrous invasion of russia on the same 
day 129 years before hitler knew the lesson well had he lost his 
senses 
one of hitlers biographers alan bullock has written the 
passions which ruled his mind were ignoble hatred resentment the 
lust for dominance and where he could not dominate to destroy 
his dictatorship was barren of all ideas save one the further 
extension of his own power and that of the nation with which he 
identified to sustain the role of the master race over the 
degraded subject peoples of his new empire in the east 
in his political testament mein kampf hitler wrote in 
1924 if we talk about the new soil and territory in europe 
today we can think primarily only of russia and its vassal border 
states the giant empire in the east is ready for collapse and 
the end of the jewish rule in russia will also be the end of russia 
as a state 
deeds matched words the year he became chancellor 1933 hitler 
halted joint clandestine training and rearmament with the soviet 
union in 1936 germany signed a pact with japan against the 
comintern marxisms international arm headed by josef stalins 
soviet union the next year he told his generals the german 
people have a right to greater living space than other peoples 
eventually they would have to fight britain france and the soviet 
union to get it 
but on aug 23 1939 foreign ministers vyacheslav molotov and 
joachim von ribbentrop signed the russiangerman nonaggression 
pact one of the most stunning flipflops in modern history two 
avowed mortal enemies were suddenly in bed together 
the stolid expressionless molotov explained to the supreme 
soviet the political art in foreign affairs is to turn 
yesterdays enemies into good neighbors the soviet union and 
germany were enemies the situation is now changed and we have 
stopped being enemies 
hardly stalins murderous purges of the soviet army officer 
corps in 1937 had bled it white he was left playing for time to 
rearm by joining hitlers invasion of poland which touched off 
world war ii he was also pushing russias frontier 200 miles to 
the west the soviet dictator was also deeply suspicious that 
capitalist britain and france wanted the soviet union to exhaust 
itself and germany in a war then they could deal with both 
to the man in the street in moscow wrote journalist alexander 
werth the consensus was that it was nasty and unpleasant to have 
to pretend to make friends with hitler but as things were in 1939 
we had to gain time at any price we thought that war with france 
would last a long time and germany would be greatly weakened 
selfish well yes but who isnt 
hitler told his propaganda people to airbrush out stalins 
cigarette in photos of the pact signing he would temporarily 
tolerate uncle joe but never smoking privately he said 
everything i have in mind is directed against russia if the west 
is too stupid to understand this then i will be forced to come to 
terms with russia to crush the west and then turn with all my 
forces against the soviet union 
in june 1940 even as his panzers were still rolling through 
france and the soviets had invaded the baltic states hitler 
ordered planning for a soviet campaign to begin 
the task was assigned to col bernhard von lossberg his plan 
ran to 30 pages and was codenamed fritz for his son it was 
predicated on an offensive in 1941 before germans began 
complacently enjoying the fruits of their astonishing victories 
and before britain had been subdued

said hitler of course the people will never see the point of 
this new campaign they must always be led by the nose to 
paradise we cannot keep up this level of armament much longer 
it is why we have to use force now because one day the 
countless millions of slavs are going to come perhaps not even in 
10 years time perhaps only after a hundred but they will come 
two months later hitlers staff began laying out a remote 
headquarters in east prussia 
hitlers army commander walter von brauchitsch confidently 
predicted only a moppingup operation would remain after a major 
battle of up to four weeks alfred jodl another of hitlers 
yes generals said the russian colossus will prove to be a 
pigs bladder prick it and it will burst 
the general staff was so confident that only one soldier in five 
was issued winter clothing napoleon made the same mistake 
field marshal wilhelm keitel hitlers chief of staff had 
doubts about a twofront war but kept silent he paid for his 
loyalty as did jodl with his life before his execution at 
nuremberg keitel wrote hitler wrongly assessed the reserves 
of bolshevism and the soviet state and it was thus he brought 
about the ruin of himself and the third reich he had created 
gen heinz guderian hitlers brilliant tank commander in 
france had few illusions so long as war in the west was 
undecided any new undertaking must result in war on two fronts 
and adolf hitlers germany was even less capable of fighting such a 
war than had been the germany of 1914 
hitler was not totally blinded by his monomania i had always 
maintained that we ought at all costs to avoid war on two fronts 
he confided to his aide martin bormann and you may rest assured 
that i pondered long and hard over napoleons experience in russia 
why then may you ask why this war against russia 
there was no hope of ending the war by an invasion of britain 
with the united states playing an increasingly aggressive role 
time was on russias side strike sooner than later 
directive 21 stressed that victory must be achieved quickly 
we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure 
will come crashing down when barbarossa begins the world will 
hold its breath 
as the months passed hitler seemed to adopt the fatalism of a 
gambling addict who sees no alternative to putting everything on 
the turn of a card if it fails then it will all be over anyway 
if it succeeds it will probably force britain to make peace 
in any event said the former world war i corporal i do not 
expect my generals to understand me but i shall expect them to 
obey my orders 
stalin was also gambling for time his actions in the seven 
months before barbarossa seem inscrutable even incomprehensible 
barbarossa was not pearl harbor stalin had repeated warnings from 
multiple directions 
in november 1940 he was concerned about german troop movements 
in romania and finland the soviets had already seized part of the 
former and were about to invade the latter stalin sent molotov 
and an entourage to berlin to protest 
ribbentrop the german foreign minister as bubbly headed as the 
champagne he used to sell blithely offered the soviets partnership 
in the germanyitalyjapan axis this could satisfy the soviet 
unions historic quest for a warm water seaport 
which sea asked the blunt molotov ribbentrop airily 
offered the persian gulf or perhaps the indian ocean molotov 
wanted a base in denmark deep in germanys baltic flank 
ribbentrop pressed his plan on molotov in an airraid shelter 
when a diplomatic dinner was adjourned underground due to british 
bombers britain was defeated said the german foreign minister 
and her empire would be there for russias taking 
if that is so why are we in this shelter and whose are those 
bombs which fall molotov deadpanned 
moscow subsequently agreed to join the axis hitler never even 
replied to the offer german troops were concentrating in the east 
he said to protect vital interests in romanian oil and swedish 
iron ore which was true enough as far as it went 
but barbarossas intent was far more hitlerian the war 
against russia he ordered cannot be fought in a knightly 
fashion this struggle is one of ideologies and racial differences 
and will have to be conducted with unprecedented merciless and 
unrelenting harshness 
special action groups einsatzgruppen were formed to 
cleanse occupied territory of jews and other objectionables 
in february 1941 the british ambassador to moscow warned of a 
german attack set for june the source not revealed was ultra 
britains masterful cracking of the code machine germany thought 
invulnerable the president of the skoda works in czechoslovakia a 
soviet informant told moscow he had been ordered to increase 
armament production for an invasion in june 
stalin who trusted no one and suspected winston churchill was 
plotting to draw russia into the war to save her chestnuts from 
the fire reacted this information is english provocation 
find out who is making this provocation and punish him 
several times the soviets master spy in tokyo german 
journalist richard sorge warned of a june invasion 
even a modestly alert espionage ring and russia had a good one 
in the red orchestra rote kapelle of communist sympathizers in 
germany would have noted the signs germany was requisitioning 
farm horses east prussian farmers along the soviet border had been 
ordered not to plant spring crops by april 1941 there had been 80 
violations of soviet air space a german camera plane had made a 
forced landing 100 miles inside the soviet union

only days after hitler ordered directive 21 into effect the 
soviet military attache in berlin was anonymously given a summary 
of barbarossa on april 19 1941 churchill based on ultra 
personaly warned stalin mystifyingly the soviets reported several 
of these tips to berlin so hitler wouldnt become suspicious that 
they were dealing under the table with the british 
was stalin irrational or an ostrich burying his head in the 
sand current analysis is that he was neither he too knew his 
napoleon warned by the yugoslav ambassador on april 6 1941 of an 
invasion by hitler stalin replied let him try it 
but the rout of the french in only six weeks the attacks by 
japan on the soviet unions asian front left him skittish yet he 
could not bring himself to trust capitalist britain and its 
toughtalking churchill nor could churchill standing alone 
against hitler entirely trust him 
marshal ai yeremenko writes in his memoirs that stalin 
failed to authorize defense measures to avoid provoking 
hitler before the soviet army was fully armed his own hope was 
for the capitalists and the nazis to destroy each other 
on april 3 1941 stalin signed a nonaggression pact with 
japan drunk he saw the japanese off at the moscow train station 
and embraced the german military attache as well saying of 
course were going to remain friends wont we 
as proof the soviet union inexplicably honored its trade 
agreement with germany shipping 2 million tons of oil and 15 
million tons of grain to the nation poised to attack it germany 
was meant to repay with manufactured goods unavoidable delays 
kept this traffic to a minimum scarcely three hours before the 
btag barbarossa day offensive began june 22 at 3 am the 
frontier was opened for the moscowberlin express train right 
behind it was a long freight of grain for germany 
on june 14 sorge radioed moscow war begins june 22 tass 
the soviet news agency was nonetheless ordered to refute war 
rumors as clumsy propaganda by forces hostile to the ussr 
on june 18 a german soldier fearing a courtmartial for 
striking an officer deserted across the border and gave the soviets 
the invasion timetable no use getting into a panic about such 
nonsense said the local commander 
stalin met with his generals on the eve of the attack but 
declined to issue an alert barton whaley in his book codeword 
barbarossa surmises that stalin believed that any german invasion 
would be preceded by an ultimatum and none had been given 
he may also have been lulled by ingenious and plausible german 
disinformation hitlers devious propagandist joseph goebbels 
leaked word that rumors of an invasion were really a cover for an 
upcoming invasion of england 
whaley says stalin was partly deafened to the authentic 
signals of doom 
thus when another german deserter june 21 got word to gen 
dmitri pavlov minsk area commander that invasion was only hours 
away pavlov shrugged seems rubbish to me 
more than 1300 soviet planes were destroyed on the ground when 
the blitzkreig struck 
barbarossa was like waterloo a very near thing initial soviet 
losses were appalling while the two opoponents armies were about 
equal in manpower the germans had their panzers but while each 
such division had 3300 vehicles only 300 were tracked and tracks 
were essential to carry the assault forward across the muddy fields 
of roadless peasant russia 
the barbaric slaughter of civilians by the einsatzgruppen cost 
hitler the support he could well have found among the 
independentminded ukrainians and byelorussians germanys invasion 
of yugoslavia and greece in march and april had also caused 
barbarossa to be delayed a month that loss of time gave stalin a 
lifesaving reprieve as the worst winter on record froze barbarossa 
in its tracks 
barbarossa of course ultimately failed its collapse left the 
soviet union astride eastern europe all the way to the elbe in 
central germany from that bastion the ussr was to challenge 
the west for almost half a century until the berlin wall fell a 
year ago

remembrances of the german invasion of the soviet 
union nearly 50 years ago still evoke strong emotions despite the 
end of the cold war 
the invasion came on june 22 1941 beginning a siege that cost 
20 million soviet lives 
and with the reunification of the two germanys this year many 
soviets fear germany will again become an aggressor 
at this years celebration of victory day marking the defeat of 
adolf hitler in 1945 veterans of world war ii were skeptical that 
the former enemy could be trusted 
unification is good but there must be a guarantee of the 
security of all people especially those who suffered the most from 
hitler said col vasily kovalev 63 its in the center of 
europe so it must be a peaceful country 
lt col konstantin palkin another veteran said im 
skeptical i dont exclude the possibility of german revenge 
but he added soviet world war ii allies would not allow that 
another veteran a senior navy officer who declined to give his 
name was repulsed by a unified germany i killed germans then 
and if i have to ill kill them again 
before mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 horror 
stories of the great patriotic war were daily fodder for 
newspapers television and movie documentaries the perils of war 
were hammered home in lessons given to schoolchildren and the cold 
war thrived on the threat of another global conflict 
even with the end of the cold war talk of germany and 
reunification draws strong responses from soviets most of whom 
lost at least one family member in the war 
vadim biryukov editor of the magazine business in the ussr 
tells of watching a television report of german war veterans 
sending gifts to soviet veterans 
everything is twisted biryukov says i have never seen 
anything more disgusting it makes me very emotional that german 
veterans can give presents to our veterans but our government 
cannot afford to 
but with reunification he said world war ii has finally become 
part of history 
all this period when germany was divided into two countries 
this experiment is over he said it proved that the system 
offered as a result of world war ii failed completely 
new times a weekly magazine said fears raised by the new 
germany were largely groundless 
although most war veterans have misgivings the magazine said 
there are no legitimate motives for germany to attack anyone the 
social conditions of the 1930s no longer exist and as far as 
economic gains were concerned german businessmen have long 
understood that this can be done in a way different from the one 
offered them by hitler 
one of the ironies emerging from the end of the cold war is 
economic aid from a wealthy germany to an impoverished soviet 
union 
but said biryukov such aid was logical and had to be accepted 
after all one country is poor the other is not so poor he 
said it proves that the human race is human after all

editors note for the past year since the fall of the berlin 
wall tourists have been rediscovering an older more traditional 
europe to the east a reporter who recently took a cruise on the 
black sea from bulgaria to the soviet crimea found a certain charm 
amid the chaos of a changing economy

theres a small hotel in fact there 
are hundreds of them that only a year ago were private villas and 
holiday retreats for communist commissars privileged artists and 
favored trade union leaders 
now the vacancy sign is out for tourists from the west or the 
far east since the yen is as welcome as the dollar the pound and 
the mark but please no levs the locals disdain the local 
currency 
and the highrise communist party house as much a fixture in 
every bulgarian city and town as the hulking statue of lenin now 
has offices to rent to shipping firms travel agents exporters and 
all kinds of entrepreneurs pouring into eastern europe since the 
fall of the berlin wall 
this is no longer a communist country we are a developing 
democracy says dmitri our guide from balkantourist the state 
travel agency as he leads a band of tourists off a cruise ship 
through the ruins of roman baths in the second century varna 
then called odessos was a rest center for the roman emperors 
legionnaires 
a little later he leads us up a precarious trail to a 
cliffhanging medieval monastery called aladja 
suddenly last summer all over eastern europe monasteries and 
churches and palaces that had been held in ideological scorn for 
half a century came back in favor those that had been used to 
store grain or billet troops or had been converted to museums of 
atheism were being swept out and refurbished 
and in beach resorts all along the black sea coast from 
bulgarias turkish border to the soviet crimea dreary highrise 
hotels in stolid stalinist gothic are scheduled for 
privatization 
ibusz the hungarian state tourist agency is on the block to

and what was east germany the royal and ancient game banned for 
decades in communist climes already is in full backswing on an 
island 21 miles up the danube from budapest at a 9hole course 
named szentendre st andrews 
here in varna dmitri says we already have a german beer 
garden an english pub a greek taverna and an indian restaurant 
we think many tourists will be coming our climate is much milder 
than the french riviera you can swim until midoctober 
on a balmy fall day several bathers were slithering down water 
slides and landing splat in mud baths along the wide beach called 
zlatri piassatsi golden sands 
hoping to match neighboring romanias oil finds drillers gushed 
up only mineral springs here some austrian tourists happened by 
after world war ii and insisted the waters cured rheumatism and 
baldness a spa was born 
shepherding his flock into a shopping arcade where some lace 
embroidery and leathercraft were displayed dmitri expresses the 
hope that bulgarias younger generation will hang in there his 
newest english idiom long enough to reap the rewards of a 
freemarket economy 
more than 100000 left the country last year he says a 
million more may go next year 
outside a young man was peddling rare icons that stained 
his jacket with their fresh coat of gilt 
in a square near the ethnographic museum the proprietor of a 
little van advertising beer herring and brandy gave a sadder 
picture of the inflated local currency he had no beer and no 
herring but a plastic cup of slivova strong plum brandy netted 
you change from a onelev note valued at 14 cents 
arriving at yalta in the crimea the cruise passengers wondered 
about the future of the 80 health resorts and sanitaria operated by 
various trade unions and government agencies nestled in the pine 
forests on the bluffs were villas and dachas of toplevel 
commissars and apparatchniki 
our intourist guide worried a little about privatization since 
individual soviet republics now have been given control of their 
own tourism but she doubts that foreign visitors will ever take 
over what she called the comrades coney island last year she 
said 2 million vacationers came to yalta adding that our local 
joke is that they sunbathe standing up 
she was eloquent on yaltas healthgiving climate winds off

with the black sea breezes to produce an atmosphere that has been 
scientifically proven to be beneficial in the treatment of stress

in keeping with the new reverence for palaces we had to don 
burlap mukluks to glide across the parquet floors of the alupka 
palace the twofaced edifice that count vorontsov had his british 
architect dream up it has a tudor castle facade on the north side 
and a ripoff of the moorish alhambra overlooking the sea on the 
south 
leaving the grounds we were besieged by hordes of young black 
marketeers flogging caviar champagne amber jewelry russian army 
caps and more genuine antique icons 
hey oncle sam you want hero medals called out a boy barely 
in his teens opening his coat like a prohibition bootlegger to 
display a lining resplendent with medals ribbons and decorations 
no what about a meelitary vatch he pushed up his sleeve and 
revealed an armload reaching beyond the elbow maybe you give me 
choongum or a marlboro cigarette 
our guide warned against pickpockets money changers who will 
give you prerevolution ukrainian notes and similar bad peoples 
since soviet president mikhail gorbachev lifted the lid on 
communisms pressure cooker all sorts of bad peoples have 
bubbled to the surface in the soviet union crime has risen nearly 
40 per cent in some larger cities where burglaries are up 80 
percent the citizens are forming neighborhood crime patrols 
the police always despised but now ridiculed and rationed to 5 
gallons of gas a day for their patrol cars keep such a low profile 
that highway accidents have increased fourfold 
director vladimir malinin of intourist recently reported that 
because of the crime situation bookings dropped 40 per cent in 
1990 and american visitors were down to 100000 from 180000 the 
year before 
heavy morning fog at odessa on the northern rim of the black sea 
delayed the docking of our ship the cunard liner vistaford 
because we arrived late and the driver is not permitted 
overtime our guide vetoed a photo opportunity at the foot of the 
famous potemkin steps twice as wide at the bottom as the top the 
staircase projects a splendid optical illusion of even greater 
height than its 455 feet 
grigori potemkin catherine the greats favorite general 
ushered in the golden age of tourism on the black sea in 
inaugurating the new harbor at sevastapol in 1797 he floated 
foreign dignitaries down the dnieper on 80 roman galleys painted 
red and gold each with its own orchestra 
since some of the new towns planned for the crimea were still on 
the drawing board potemkin had facades of fake buildings erected 
and transported in thousands of peasants to populate his potemkin 
villages a sort of disneyland on the dnieper 
our guide dismissed an enchanting orthodox cathedral with golden 
onion domes as not important and attempted to hurry us into the 
hardcurrency beryozka shop which sold vodka fur hats amber 
jewelry and other luxury items available only to foreigners 
the way was blocked by a very drunken comrade being rushed along 
by two friends in almost as bad shape he teetered from their grasp 
and fell on his face in the gutter blood gushing from his cuts 
somogan spat out our guide in disgust the word means 
moonshine vodka a popular blackmarket item in the wake of 
gorbachevs temperance campaign 
saturday evidently was marrying day in odessa dozens of wedding 
parties emerged from a government registry office to pose for 
pictures on the lawn and under the porticoes of the handsome opera 
house one of europes finest 
the brides in long white gowns the grooms in formal wear some 
with top hats arrived in horsedrawn carriages and vintage 
limousines gaily decorated with flowers streamers and silver 
bells 
some alighted from taxicabs and the tandem threecar trolleys 
one bride was delivered by an ambulance driven by a friend or 
relative most bridal couples were in their 30s and beyond 
they marry late because there is a long wait for an apartment 
sometimes 10 years a taxi driver told us many will move in 
with relatives 
downtown odessa with its broad boulevards chestnut trees and 
the fading elegance of its hotels museums opera house and older 
apartments built in czarist baroque retains the charm of an older 
europe but that vanishes as one proceeds past the university to 
the grim blocks of tower apartments in communist concrete 
gradually the clock is being turned back in odessa rival 
political parties are beginning to emerge proletariat street has 
changed its name back to french boulevard 
before bidding us farewell the lady from intourist delivered 
one of those stupefying tourguide statistcs that trouble your 
sleep like the rumblings of an underdone blini unsurpassed in 
its curative qualities the mud of odessa has long been recognized 
as the world standard for mud

one of the delights of traveling east of vienna austria is 
encountering the older traditional europe 
for the most part the cities are safe after dark the ivers 
are all polluted but the countryside remains unscarred by the 
bulldozer and commercial development muledrawn plows are common 
the pace of life is slower in a society of guaranteed 
employment and subsidized housing health care and even holidays 
there was no rat race 
a year ago any contact with foreigners was forbidden now people 
are eager to practice their rusty english 
but there is a drabness and a sadness about the people they 
betray a sense of having been left behind of having missed out on 
something in the halfcentury of totalitarian rule 
the tourist must not get carried away with the nostalgia 
promised in the new travel brochures old world charm can mean 
the bathroom is a long way down the hall unspoiled can 
translate to never fixed 
telephones dont work toilets dont work in many hotels 
neither do the staffers a system that subsidized idleness and 
inefficiency does not convert readily to the concept of 
customerfriendly 
travelers who have ventured eastward have tales to tell of rats 
in closets beds with fleas restaurants where you bring your own 
bread and the plat du jour is a stew festering with the viscera of 
an unidentified animal and best you dont ask

editors note as bright as a sunburst is the face of a child 
who discovers how to whistle but where have all the whistlers 
gone has whistling a happy tune become a dying art it seems so 
partly because much of todays music doesnt have a tune you can 
pucker up to 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

you do know how to whistle dont you you just 
put your lips together and blow 
that was lauren bacalls husky parting shot to humphrey bogart 
in the classic film to have and have not but it seems hardly 
anybody follows that advice anymore 
oh sure people whistle you hear those earsplitting shrieks 
at football games the shrill blasts that beckon home wandering 
pets the descending note of surprise the appreciative wolf 
whistle 
but in many parts of the country its rare to hear somebody 
whistling a tune in public rarer still to hear it done well 
its almost a lost art says bill taylor of musician 
magazine in boston 
its a throwback to a bygone era adds harry lipson a 
boston folk music promoter 
earlier in this century streetcorner whistling simply mirrored 
popular music top performers bing crosby al jolson sammy davis 
jr jack benny and folk singer pete seeger to name a few 
whistled in their acts and amateurs picked up the tunes 
but the only one of that group still living seeger no longer 
whistles in performances i havent heard him do it in years 
says agent harold leventhal 
fred taylor a boston jazz promoter says some artists 
occasionally incorporate whistling into their acts and a few 
avantgarde musicians whistle exclusively its in the novelty 
category he says its a cult 
among the faithful is brad terry who discovered his unusual 
talent about 25 years ago while standing in a cavernous manhattan 
parking garage 
terry a jazz clarinet player from brunswick maine had just 
finished a jam session while waiting for an attendant to deliver 
his car he started whistling 
it was extraordinary says terry it had tremendous 
reverberation there were 25 or 30 people standing on a platform 
behind me and they all started applauding 
not long after that he tried whistling with a microphone 
its been part of the act ever since he says 
terry who has recorded three whistling albums is among the few 
professional practitioners of what appears to be a vanishing art 
downbeat magazine has called terry the finest jazz whistler in 
the world another practitioner is ron mccroby of chagrin falls 
ohio an advertising executive by trade mccroby has recorded jazz 
and classical albums and appeared on the tonight show 
meanwhile a group of sparetime whistlers has tried for more 
than a decade to revive the dying art 
each of us had noticed that you dont hear whistling 
anymore says iimi drummond of horsham pa who publishes a 
newsletter for the international whistlers association so we 
formed the association to promote whistling especially among 
children 
the group evolved from a whistling contest sponsored by the 
chamber of commerce in carson city nev in 1977 
about 30 people showed up to that first whistleoff some 
whistling a cappella some accompanied by piano guitar banjo 
washboards taped music and even live backup singers 
since then the associations membership has grown to about 200 
they try to gather annually for a whistleoff but as further 
evidence of whistlings fading popularity this years contest had 
to be canceled because they couldnt find a sponsor 
hardcore whistlers want to elevate whistling to a serious 
musical form we dont do the birdwhistle competition says 
drummond a national champion who once performed the merry widow 
waltz at a whistleoff 
at the same time whistlers want to preserve the lighthearted 
spirit that prompted them to whistle so they included a novelty 
category one year a contestant performed while standing on her 
head others have whistled to the accompaniment of typewriters 
kazoos and musical saws 
whistlers call their art a form of selfexpression thats more 
socially acceptable than bursting into song in public 
its nice to walk down the street and see people smiling at 
you drummond says if you walked down the street singing how 
great thou art youd get carted away in a wagon 
technically whistling is the sound produced by pushing air 
through the rounded lips whistlers can control pitch by moving 
their tongues and changing the flow of breath 
beyond that techniques differ most make music by blowing air 
out a few by drawing it in most pucker some smile widely as 
they whistle through their teeth some produce a reedy sound deep 
in their throats some whistle through their fingers or their 
fists 
a few virtuosos can produce two notes almost simultaneously and 
some boast ranges of two octaves or more 
whistling so it is said began as signaling the earliest known 
whistlers were shepherds and sailors who wanted sounds to carry 
great distances 
in the united states whistling was a popular form of musichall 
entertainment in the 19th and early 20th century according to the 
oxford companion to music an entertainer named mrs alice shaw 
known as la belle siffleuse the beautiful whistler performed 
throughout the country as well as for european royalty 
early in this century aspiring whistlers could study at agnes 
woodwards california school of artistic whistling in los angeles 
its gone but there remain textbooks on the market such as how 
to whistle like a pro without driving anyone else crazy by 
david harp 
musician fred lowrey performed with big band orchestras 
recorded a dozen albums and wrote his autobiography whistling in 
the dark contemporary whistlers still perform his version of 
indian love call 
not everyone appreciated the art a 1986 smithsonian magazine 
article cited a 1931 complaint from charles shaw a philosophy 
professor at new york university 
whistling is an unmistakable sign of the moron shaw said 
why has whistling faded to a mere echo of its former glory 
for one thing drummond says much current music rap heavy 
metal rock synthesized pop doesnt rely on the simple melodies 
that translate easily to whistling even the beatles are hard to 
whistle she says 
whistlers acknowledge reluctantly that some people find 
whistling as annoying a habit as knucklecracking or pentapping 
whistling also carries some negative connotations tattletales 
are whistleblowers a whistlestop speech offers little substance 
some people whistle past the graveyard to cover their fears 
cartoon characters whistle when theyre trying to cover something 
up 
women have had to overcome additional antiwhistling prejudices 
victorian etiquette books declared the practice vulgar in louisa 
may alcotts little women ladylike meg exhorts sister jo to 
stop because its so boyish 
mimi drummond quotes an old saying of uncertain origin 
a whistling girl and a crowing hen 
will surely come to some bad end

whistling may be on the wane but it has had its moments in 
american musical history 
whistling figured prominently in several movies notably the 
bridge on the river kwai and the high and the mighty and of 
course walt disneys seven dwarfs in snow white whistled while 
they worked 
whistling also helped define disneys oldest and most popular 
character mickey mouse early cartoons depict mickey strolling 
along hands clasped behind his back face tilted to the sky lips 
puckered 
more recently jason serinus of los angeles has provided the 
whistling voice of woodstock snoopys feathered friend on the 
charlie brown specials 
the cheerfully whistled theme song of the 1960s situation comedy 
mayberry rfd still lives on in reruns 
a few songs celebrate the art whistling in the dark for 
instance or whistle a happy tune from the king and i other 
songs include whistled passages the 1970s rock n roll song 
hocus pocus consisted only of instrumental music interspersed 
with yodeling and manic whistling 
movie and cartoon characters have long used whistling as an 
obvious disguise for guilt ineffective talk is whistling in the 
wind nonsensical talk is just whistling dixie a gesture of 
false courage is whistling past the graveyard 
whistling also has its superstitions 
some hold that whistling inside a house is as risky as opening 
an umbrella indoors well into the 20th century whistling aboard 
ship was said to summon up a gale whistling in a theater was 
believed to doom the current production and veteran journalists 
swear its bad luck to whistle in a newsroom 
some cultures have prohibited whistling altogether arab 
countries consider it evil and victorian etiquette books 
pronounced it vulgar at least for women 
some people are annoyed by whistling or find it tiresome no 
more tiresome though than their stock remark did you have 
birdseed for lunch

editors note in the philippines shaken by political and 
social upheavals in its 44 years of independence leaders come and 
go but life in the countryside remains the same in villages such 
as pililla its a daily struggle for survival but a pervading 
fatalism and commitment to family provide a degree of stability 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
as the first rays of the sun burst 
over the verdant mountains villagers awaken to natures alarm 
clock the cacophony of hundreds of roosters signaling a new day 
women in simple housedresses shuffle along the concrete streets 
to the neighborhood sarisari stores to buy food for breakfast 
usually rice eaten with fish caught in the nearby laguna de bay a 
huge freshwater lake 
men and women crowd around outdoor handcranked water pumps to 
bathe in the cool morning hours 
for the 25000 people in this town 30 miles southeast of manila 
this day will be much like the thousands which preceded it a slow 
search for food and sustenance 
during the past decade the philippine islands have been shaken 
by political turmoil economic dislocation and social unrest 
including the 1986 people power revolution that toppled the 
late president ferdinand marcos and propelled corazon aquino into 
the presidency 
but in this town and thousands like it where 70 percent of the 
60 million filipinos live the rhythm of life has remained 
unchanged despite the upheavals in the capital manila life here 
is governed by customs and traditions shaped over the centuries 
critics complain that many aspects of that lifestyle including 
fatalism family commitments and respect for authority deter 
social progress 
but the timeless quality of filipino life also provides a degree 
of stability in a nation still struggling to define its system of 
governing 44 years after independence from the united states 
urban filipinos grappling with pollution overcrowding and 
horrific traffic tend to romanticize about the simple beauty of 
life in the provinces 
during religious festivals or public holidays thousands of 
urban dwellers return to the provinces to visit relatives and tend 
the graves of ancestors the betteroff urban relatives often give 
money to their lessfortunate kin or if possible help them get 
jobs in the city 
for those who stay behind in the provinces life is a struggle 
it seems that nothing much has changed says nita bolante a 
housewife life is hard these days everything is expensive 
pililla a farming and fishing village in a relatively 
prosperous province isnt faced with the kind of hopeless poverty 
seen in the mountain communities of luzon island or the hinterlands 
of mindanao the second largest of the 7100 philippine islands 
but by western standards life here is still grim 
most people live in twostory tinroofed homes of wood and 
stone built close by one another the ground floor houses chickens 
or an occasional pig and goat 
the second story serves by day as a sitting room by night as a 
common bedroom where family members sleep on woven mats of palm 
leaves many residents tend small vegetable plots in a country with 
virtually a yearround growing season 
during the day crowds of young men dressed in tshirts and 
shorts loiter in the streets unable to find work so common is 
the phenomenon that the filipino language has a word for them 
istambay a philippinized version of the english phrase i 
stand by 
most istambays work occasionally helping out in the fields 
during harvests fishing or hustling cigarettes in the streets of 
larger towns 
when they accumulate a little money they quit and fritter away 
their time drinking local whisky until the cash is gone then they 
work again 
the rev leonardo legazpi archbishop of naga attributes the 
istambay phenomenon to climate and centuries of colonial rule 
which discouraged personal initiative 
you build your house then the typhoon blows it down and you 
build it again legazpi says the filipino can work very hard 
but theres never a feeling that you work to improve your 
condition 
one istambay ronnie tejade 28 says he worked most 
recently at an appliance factory until he accumulated enough 
seniority to qualify for severance pay 
he then quit collected his severance and used the money to pay 
off his debts because his salary of 36 a month fell short of his 
expenses 
when i dont work i earn nothing tejade says when you 
work you still earn nothing it comes to that 
but asian fatalism has prevented this sense of hopelessness from 
becoming the catalyst for social revolution 
im not blaming the government tejade says as he sips his 
whisky we were born this way we have to live our lives this 
way 
lack of educational opportunities contribute to the cycle 
pililla has a free staterun elementary school but the nearest 
public high school is 15 miles away in morong 
there is no free school bus service and many parents cannot 
afford the 14 a month transportation charge as well as fees for 
books meals and uniforms 
for the more ambitious provinciano the ticket to a better 
life has traditionally been a job abroad especially in the middle 
east a half million filipinos work in saudi arabia alone and send 
home their savings to families in the provinces 
many saudi boys as they are known locally return with 
savings which they invest in small businesses such as neighborhood 
stores 
i have a dream but its still unfulfilled says hermi 
retuerna 28 a foreman on a small farm i want to join my 
brother in saudi arabia i want to leave for the future of my two 
children 
longterm separations strain family ties but the alternatives 
are worse 
you may be together but you have nothing to eat and you cannot 
send your children to school says mrs bolante whose husband 
works in saudi arabia and sends home 200 a month to his wife and 
five children at least theres an assurance youll be able to 
eat 
family ties strong in philippine culture keep many villagers 
from leaving as in other asian societies filipinos often live in 
extended families with aged parents breadwinners and children 
under the same roof 
breadwinners pool their resources for the familys livelihood 
those who cannot work are rarely turned away the system inhibits a 
natural flow of workers to available jobs and keeps unemployment 
rates high in impoverished areas 
but it also provides the individual filipino with an economic 
and psychological cushion in a country where few earn pensions or 
collect welfare 
its better to stay here simply because of the family says 
norbita arevalo a teacher and one of only two breadwinners in her 
family of seven its more comfortable here in the province

editors note he was a farm boy from kansas with his eyes on 
the skies a tinkerer who could build telescopes but had never been 
to college then one day in 1930 clyde tombaugh spotted a dot in 
the heavens that would change his life forever not to mention 
change the study of astronomy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sixty years ater he discovered the 
planet pluto spinning three billion miles from earth clyde 
tombaugh cant keep his hands off telescopes 
at age 84 tombaugh is supposed to be retired resting on his 
laurels as one of only four people ever to have discovered a 
planet 
instead the snowyhaired astronomer is still crisscrossing the 
country lecturing about pluto to raise funds for postdoctoral 
astronomy students at new mexico state university where he taught 
for 12 years 
and hes still building telescopes which is how the former farm 
boy got started in astronomy in the first place at the moment 
hes working on one for his 16yearold granddaughter 
im going to have her do some of the polishing and have her 
test the curve he says shes going to get a good introduction 
to it 
tombaugh has no hobbies that arent related to astronomy his 
lifelong love im always interested in making telescopes 
grinding mirrors and so on he says i love that 
on a recent lecture stop in spencerport the planet hunter 
handled a throng of elementary school students with the experienced 
patter of a cornball comedian 
thats a very good question he told a girl who asked how 
pluto got its name the name was chosen by scientists at lowell 
observatory where the planet was discovered he says then with 
his face crinkling into a wide grin he adds 
some people think its named after pluto the pup of course 
theres no connection i think the planet came first im not 
sure 
how cold is pluto a student calls out 
the air that you breathe nitrogen and oxygen would be 
frozen solid rock on pluto tombaugh says itd be a little 
hard to breathe wouldnt it 
tombaugh was just 24 fresh off his familys kansas wheat farm 
with only a high school diploma to his name when he discovered 
pluto in 1930 six decades later the discovery remains his 
proudest achievement 
tombaugh got interested in astronomy in the sixth grade when 
his favorite subject was geography i wondered what the geography 
was like on other planets and ive been at it ever since he 
says 
in high school tombaugh built a telescope and spent long hours 
making careful drawings of mars and jupiter he wanted to be an 
astronomer he says but his family didnt have the money to send 
him to college 
in 1929 tombaughs drawings got him hired on a trial basis as 
an assistant at the lowell observatory in flagstaff ariz he was 
to help search for a transneptunian planet with the observatorys 
new 13inch telescope 
of the nine planets now known to be circling the sun six had 
been known since antiquity the english astronomer william herschel 
discovered the seventh uranus in 1781 in 1846 two people are 
credited with the discovery of neptune the eighth the english 
astronomer john c adams and the french mathematician urbain jj 
leverrier 
the existence of a ninth planet was predicted in 1915 by 
percival lowell who believed planet x was causing deviations 
in the orbits of uranus and neptune 
tombaughs job was to compare 14by17inchphotographs of the 
night sky on a device called a blinkmicroscopecomparator which 
rapidly switched between two images taken several days apart if a 
planet were visible it would have moved to a new position in the 
second photograph in more crowded areas of the universe such as 
the milky way more than 2000 stars filled every square inch of 
the photograph each had to be examined for even the most 
infinitesimal movement 
it was tedious tombaugh says but it was much more 
interesting work than farming as far as i was concerned 
on feb 18 1930 tombagh found what he was looking for a tiny 
dot of light had moved an eighth of an inch 
it electrified me he says in one split second i 
realized id be world famous and turn the scientific world 
upsidedown it was a tremendous feeling 
i was excited but i didnt go around yelling i figured itd 
just alarm everybody it alarmed them plenty when i told them i 
found a planet 
as it turned out lowells prediction of planet xs location had 
just been lucky pluto now estimated to have about twotenths of 
a percent of earths mass is much too small to cause 
irregularities in the other planets orbits 
for finding pluto the novice astronomer got a 10 raise and a 
nominal prize from the royal astronomical society in great britain 
later tombaugh got a bachelors and masters degree in 
astronomy from the university of kansas and continued combing the 
skies discovering a globular star cluster a supercluster of 
galaxies several lesser clusters one comet and about 775 
asteroids one of which bears his name 
tombaugh lives in las cruces nm with patricia his wife of 56 
years and a mostly black cat named pluto he wears a watch his son 
had made for him which features walt disneys cartoon dog pluto 
tombaugh doesnt put much stock in speculation that a 10th 
planet exists it could be out there but it would have to be very 
small or very far away for him to have missed seeing it on his 
plates he says 
itd be interesting to see if they ever did find one but its 
going to be some hard digging he says actually im a little 
pessimistic about it 
tombaugh says he has looked at 45 million stars in his lifetime 
more than twothirds of the visible universe he has seen more of 
the heavens starry expanses than perhaps anyone else 
i had a grand view of the universe he says i often 
wonder how people who never had any exposure to this view the 
world theyre not aware of all this universe around them they 
think the earth is it

editors note their names are olivier and redgrave and cusack 
three of the most famous names in the london theater this season 
several members of those families are teaming up in the same plays 
a sort of thinking mans osmonds as one newspaper columnist 
put it 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
despite some sniping that it smacks of gimmickry 
the london theater is celebrating its english and irish acting 
dynasties with three productions that are truly family affairs 
on dec 5 laurence oliviers widow joan plowright opened at 
the old vic theater in a revival of jb priestleys time and the 
conways the cast includes the two olivier daughters tamsin and 
juliekate directed by their brother richard 
one week later dec 11 came the redgrave sisters vanessa and 
lynn in anton chekhovs the three sisters the opening at the 
queens theater marks their first stage appearance together 
the third sister is played by their 24yearold niece jemma 
redgrave the daughter of their actor brother corin jemma joins 
her cousins natasha and joely richardson in the fifth generation 
of acting redgraves 
chekhovs masterwork has already been seen in another family 
production in london this year that soldout production which 
ended sept 29 starred irelands cusack sisters sinead sorcha 
and niamh cusack and their father cyril 
while keenly aware that these ventures are vulnerable to charges 
of gimmickry all three families found the blood ties invigorating 
we were all very aware of the pitfalls says sorcha cusack 
thats why it took us so long to commit ourselves to doing it 
lynn redgrave says whatever we did together it had not to be 
a gimmick it had to be something that in any legitimate production 
anywhere we would have been thought of for those parts 
the productions have been warmly supported by audiences and 
critics though not without dissent 
lack of box office bankability singly is bolstered by the 
sheer gimmickiness of having all the family work together a sort 
of thinking mans osmonds snarled columnist julie burchill in 
the mail a sunday newspaper 
most commentators however were enthusiastic about productions 
that bring a lifetime of intimacy to the theater 
i just think that if youve got a vocabulary that goes back 40 
years as is the case with myself and sorcha theres no doubt at 
all that we have a given says sinead cusack 
its there in our bloodstream our very being which is to do 
with our umbilical cords 
sinead at age 42 the oldest cusack sister played masha the 
middle one of chekhovs trio sorcha 40 played the older olga 
niamh 30 played baby sister irina in a production that looks 
likely to transfer to new york in the new year 
lynn redgrave says her familys production resulted from a 
benefit performance on dec 10 1989 in new york where vanessa 
was finishing her broadway engagement in tennessee williams 
orpheus descending 
vanessa was organizing a concert called the wall breaks to 
benefit victims of stalins repression to conclude the first act 
she asked lynn sigourney weaver and christopher reeve to join her 
in a condensed version of the final scene of the three sisters 
i was full of nerves about it recalls lynn redgrave 47 
the younger sister by six years there was a real sort of quiet 
in the house and one realized here we were walking forward for 
the first time 
before long a project was born 
the minute we did the concert i knew this could work which 
is why we so wholeheartedly went into it she says 
the three sisters is actually the second sisters act for 
the redgraves 
four days before rehearsals began they completed a tv remake of 
the 1962 horror film whatever happened to baby jane its due 
to be aired in the united states on abc in february lynn inherits 
bette daviss role as the demented baby jane hudson with vanessa 
filling joan crawfords shoes as her crippled sister 
we havent spent this much consecutive time together since we 
were children laughs lynn redgrave who unlike vanessa has 
based most of her career in the united states its bringing back 
memories we havent had in ages 
but lynn says there were times when sibling undercurrents left 
off and chekhovs creations took over 
we feel very much that we are these characters or our version 
of these characters she says while were actually playing it 
the family links are a bit more amorphous 
sorcha cusack had a similar experience obviously when im 
working im not thinking whether its my sister or not my sister 
but of course they are my sisters thats something thats there 
for free i dont think about it 
in time and the conways written in 1937 joan plowright 
plays the matriarch presiding over a brood of kids two of whom are 
played by her and lord oliviers reallife daughters 
it can help well it does help a lot because you are 
dealing with people who are very close to you and all that feeling 
of familiarity is there for you says tamsin olivier 27 
but her 29yearold brother richard the plays director 
stresses that priestley was writing about the conways not the 
oliviers 
i wouldnt want people to family spot he says 
hopefully they come to see the play primarily and if they enjoy 
peoples performances then thats terrific 
next spring timothy west and prunella scales husband and wife 
in real life play the fraught tyrones in eugene oneills long 
days journey into night at the royal national theater no word 
yet on whether their son sam west an actor will play one of the

bill smitrovich says his portrayal of a 
working class guy on abcs life goes on is patterned after 
a man who remains a symbol in his own life 
i put a lot of my father into drew thatcher he says hes 
a throwback to a man whos lived through tough times i draw the 
spirit of drew from my father theyre from the same kind of 
hardworking background 
life goes on is about a family facing a financial struggle 
and the challenge of a son with downs syndrome it also stars patti 
lupone as his wife libby chris burke as corky their son and 
kellie martin as becca their daughter 
smitrovichs father william s smitrovich sr who died in 
1965 moved his family from connecticut to new mexico to california 
in search of work as a tool and die maker bill the actor 
attended 12 different schools before the family returned to 
connecticut 
his father had asthma and often slept sitting up he says 
but at 6 am every morning he was up and at em he had a sense 
of duty pride and workmanship 
smitrovich fulfilled his fathers dream by getting a degree at 
the university of bridgeport it was in college that he discovered 
his love of acting and he gave some of his time to a cause he 
believes helped him prepare for his role in life goes on 
while in college he minored in special education and tutored 
children with downs syndrome after graduation he was a leader in a 
work shelter for children with downs syndrome and cerebral palsy 
drews a highprincipled man who tries to live for his 
family smitrovich says i think he feels that when corky came 
into his life that was a message hes a godfearing man part of 
him would like to have a normal son and hes a frustrated man 
because hes never gotten to fulfill some of his dreams 
he went into construction work because he couldnt become an 
architect now he owns a restaurant because he wants to be his own 
boss hes a hardworking middleclass american who believes in 
the union and buying american he believes in the american dream 
but has probably been burned by it a few times 
on life goes on the thatchers will have another child at 
the end of the season lupone who is pregnant filmed her scenes 
for three shows in advance of her absence for maternity leave 
shell miss several episodes but she will return afterward and 
wear a fat suit until the thatcher baby is born 
life goes on is the second series for smitrovich who was 
sgt danny krychek in nbcs crime story he costarred in 
crazy people and has been in such movies as without a 
trace splash marias lovers a little sex silver 
bullet manhunter her alibi and renegades 
in the miami vice pilot he was sonny crocketts partner who 
became corrupt to get money for his son who requires use of a 
wheelchair 
smitrovich is living in southern california for the series but 
also has a home in connecticut hes married to shaw purnell an 
actress he met while doing a play in new york she was his exwife 
in the play never say die his son alexander john called 
aj was born in nevada while he was working on crime 
story 
i was creatively frustrated doing crime story because it was 
more style than substance he says it was set in the 1950s 
with the old cars and clothes and i worked with a great bunch of 
guys but i wished wed stayed in chicago with the show it got too 
glitzy in las vegas i was hoping wed be like a grand opera comic 
book but it never reached those heights

the 16 musicals created by george and ira 
gershwin between 1921 and 1933 were not written for posterity they 
only had a life expectancy of their original broadway runs 
when these shows closed after six months or sometimes a year no 
one ever bothered to preserve all the material from them hit songs 
such as the man i love i got rhythm someone to watch 
over me swonderful and others survived but the musicals 
they were from often did not 
there wasnt the sense that anyone would want to hear some 50 
or 60 years later the entire score from girl crazy strike 
up the band treasure girl funny face lady be 
good and tiptoes 
with the advent of the cast album in 1943 that changed 
audiences found a way to keep alive their memories of original 
performances but george and ira gershwin had written their last 
broadway show nearly a decade earlier 
now a major recording project is under way to document all the 
gershwin theater works including the shows lyricist ira gershwin 
wrote with other composers such as kurt weill vernon duke and 
arthur schwartz the recordings will use scores carefully 
reconstructed from original manuscripts 
the comprehensive effort has been financed by leonore gershwin 
iras widow mrs gershwin now 90 formed roxbury recordings 
named after the stately drive in beverly hills where the couple 
lived and where she still lives 
she has taken it as a mission in life to make sure that the 
works of her husband and his brother are preserved in the best 
possible way says michael strunsky mrs gershwins nephew who 
represents her on the project my aunt wants people forever to 
hear what george and ira really wrote at a quality level they 
would be proud of 
the companys first effort released in december on electra 
nonesuch records and done in collaboration with the library of 
congress is girl crazy a 1930 gershwin musical trifle 
fashioned for willie howard a big musical comedy star of the day 
the original show also featured two teenagers one named ethel 
merman and the other ginger rogers 
the new release the first complete recording of the show stars 
lorna luft in the merman role judy blazer singing rogers part 
david carroll and frank gorshin 
in a sense we are the shows original cast album says 
luft who had the daunting task of singing i got rhythm and 
boy what love has done to me two songs closely associated 
with merman throughout her career 
there were no modern interpretations on the recording luft 
says there is a tendency of course with songs like i got 
rhythm to use a more uptodate vocal style i had to not use it 
at all 
you want to exude a sense of fun with this music says john 
mauceri conductor of the new recording and a champion of restoring 
old broadway musicals for stage and record it should be quite 
contagious 
sometimes youll hear a recent recording of an old show and 
it sounds like an adult education course and then when you listen 
to the original performers on old 78 records you smile one of the 
things i wanted to make sure was present in this music was its 
smile girl crazy is one of the happiest scores george and ira 
ever wrote 
listen to modern versions of i got rhythm mauceri says 
most singers seem to get the rhythm wrong 
if youre doing it right its very entertaining he says 
the orchestrations and the arrangements really only work when you 
sing them in the right style 
the problem is that most of those original orchestrations have 
long disappeared research was required to put the shows back into 
their original state 
restoration work on girl crazy was supervised by tommy 
krasker producer of the recording series and archivist for the 
gershwin estate his task which took about six months was made 
easier because much of the shows original material including 
orchestrations was available 
krasker was not so lucky with strike up the band the second 
show in the project which was recorded in early december with 
mauceri again conducting an extensive research effort had to be 
undertaken 
at the gershwin home in california krasker pored over musical 
manuscripts lyric sheets and scrapbooks about the show he scoured 
old reviews and other newspaper articles listened to period 
recordings and studied photographs 
strike up the band which originally had a book by george s 
kaufman was one of the gershwins most interesting failures and 
successes a 1927 version of the show closed in philadelphia and 
never made it to new york a revised version became a hit three 
years later roxbury has recorded both versions and will release 
them next summer 
the first version of strike up the band was a dark comedy 
an antiwar piece about the united states going to war with 
swizterland to protest a tariff on swiss cheese the second with a 
revised book by morris ryskind softened the antiwar tone turning 
the war into a dream sequence and the fight over cheese into a 
battle over chocolate 
strike up the band certainly was groundbreaking in terms of 
subject matter characterization integration of script and 
score krasker says 
the problem was that outside of pianovocal material and lyric 
sheets not much of the original remained out of some 40 songs in 
the two versions of the show krasker found orchestrations for only 
six 
what he did was hire six of the theaters most accomplished 
orchestrators sid ramin bill brohn dick hyman russell warner 
larry wilcox and ralph burns to write orchestrations in the style 
of the period 
all the lyrics for strike up the band were found and only 
one piece of music the verse to a song called meadow serenade 
was missing its refrain had been remembered by kay swift a 
composer and good friend of george gershwin 
krasker asked burton lane composer of finians rainbow and 
a onetime collaborator of ira gershwin to write a new verse 
a few days after i handed him the lyric he came in with a 
tune that was absolutely wonderful he says it feels like it 
was all written in one stroke burtons verse and georges refrain 
complement each other beautifully i have to think its going to be 
one of the highlights of the recording

guitar music of nicolo paganini europa frederic zigante 
 
paganini the demon of the violin who transformed the 
instruments technique and turned himself into legend was also an 
accomplished guitarist that is no secret nor the fact that he 
wrote numerous chamber works involving the guitar usually with 
violin 
but paganini 17821840 also wrote an astonishingly vast and 
until recently unknown number of solo works for the instrument a 
complete edition was not published until the mid1980s 150 years 
after they were written before then only 26 of his guitar pieces 
were available dating from a 1926 edition europa introduces most 
of this new richness of repertoire on four discs beautifully 
played by frederic zigante 
the pieces on the release break down into 40 sonatas five 
sonatinas 16 various onemovement works and 43 ghiribizzi or 
popular song transcriptions from mozart paganini himself and 
lesser composers of the day 
according to zigantes excellent notes paganini publicly never 
performed any of these though he might have planned to publish 
some during his lifetime because a small number survive in neat 
copies apparently prepared for a printer paganini was also 
famously protective of his manuscripts when concertizing around 
europe he would personally distribute and retrieve the orchestra 
parts to his concertos for fear of pirated editions 
because he rarely played the guitar in public and because he 
learned it pretty much on his own paganini developed his own 
guitar technique zigante points out that he doesnt use the 
progression of positions of standard 19thcentury technique and 
writes music that is horizontal in nature more like a violin and 
less like vertical chordal writing more typical of the instrument 
many of paganinis violinistic tendencies can be heard 
arpeggios beginning phrases sudden register changes leaps and 
fast scales but more striking are the large number of simpler 
pieces with easy flowing melodies and naturalsounding 
accompaniment 
zigantes playing matches his scholarship he has a warm sound 
and lyrical manner and keeps an obvious affection for this music 
despite recording more than 100 pieces totaling four hours and 20 
minutes by the same composer 
it is a wealth of excellent music for classical guitar lovers 
and listeners partial to 19thcentury italian melody one hopes it 
will spur interest in paganinis guitar output and prompt more live 
performances of it by guitarists

triple threat alligator records lucky peterson 
 
a 20plusyear career would denote senior status for many 
performers bluesman lucky petersons 20plus years of performing 
leave him in his mid20s with 20plus years to go a musical 
prodigy at 3 peterson is emerging as a young ambassador of the 
blues robert cray may have the name recognition and the big record 
label contract but peterson is one to watch 
triple threat petersons second effort for alligator 
records and his fourth solo lp is an excellent showcase for the 
multitalented native of buffalo ny peterson massages the 
keyboards with the same soul that wells up out of his big voice 
for proof listen to im free youll also hear the third of 
petersons triple threats his fine guitar playing 
where cray has shaped his earlier raw sounds to draw more 
commercial appeal peterson still revels in the edginess of a 
tough urban beat but theres a healthy dose of soul running 
through the record theres also great potential for peterson to 
take his ambassadorship across the line of commercialism ala cray 
and spread the word of the blues 
lyrics on triple threat dont grab hold of your shortterm 
memory like more commercial music does youre not likely to find 
yourself repeating dont cloud up on me if you aint going to 
rain in the shower but for that weakness the record is a great 
mix of funky soul and blues with a beat

for 30 years they have been an 
ideal combination of filmmakers james ivory the aesthetic 
american director of a series of literate movies ismail merchant 
the wellnamed producer from india the voluble moneyraiser for his 
partners dreams 
actually its a triumvirate ruth prawer jhabvala germanborn 
of polish parents educated in england and married to an indian 
architect has written most of the 15 merchantivory features the 
trio combined again on their most ambitious venture yet mr and 
mrs bridge starring paul newman and joanne woodward 
most of the trios films have literary beginnings henry james 
the europeans and the bostonians and em forsters room 
with a view and maurice for example 
mr and mrs bridge stems from a pair of novels by evan s 
connell they trace 30 years of marriage of a welltodo kansas 
city couple 
ivory and merchant sat down for a joint interview at the beverly 
hills hotel ivory is a wellgroomed meticulous man born in 
berkeley calif and educated at the university of oregon and the 
university of southern california film school his fascination with 
india led him to make documentaries about indian art and life in 
delhi in 1961 he joined with merchant and jhabvala in their first 
feature the householder 
born in bombay merchant has lived and worked in europe and 
america he graduated in business from new york university he 
became partners with ivory when they met at the cannes film 
festival a born salesman merchant financed their early films with 
the frozen rupee funds of american distributors 
financing mr and mrs bridge was an easy sell merchant 
said with jhabvalas script and the newmans participation he was 
able to make a deal with his first customer cineplex odeon 
the film cost 75 million and all of it is visible on the 
screen he insisted he cited the cooperation of people in kansas 
city as well as new york suppliers one of them contributed 
250000 worth of draperies and other materials 
lets not get lost here snapped ivory ever the director 
why dont we start all over again lets not go into a thing 
about the draperies let that be a later question 
lets get on to the key source of our success good script 
good actors good material thats why weve gotten wherever we 
have gotten 
ivory also bristled at the suggestion that he was dealing with 
superstars for the first time in mr and mrs bridge 
its not for the first time its the first time in the sense 
of working in the united states yes certainly but ive worked 
with some superstars in great britain maggie smith james mason 
vanessa redgrave all marvelous actors in my mind paul and joanne 
are in that league of great actors 
the project grew out of a dinner conversation with miss woodward 
in new york 
it was an accidental conversation reported merchant we 
started talking about books and joanne said she had read this 
wonderful book mrs bridge but not many people knew about it 
jim had found it 20 years ago in calcutta in a small bookstore he 
gave it to me and said its a wonderful book it could make a 
good movie 
it was joannes project continued ivory she wanted to 
make mrs bridge for television and she already had an 
arrangement with producer robert halmi we talked them into 
combining the book with mr bridge paul said if he liked the 
script he would play mr bridge he did like the script and 
thats how we got going 
both newmans have been directors but ivory said that posed no 
problems 
that just made it easier we got over a lot of material fast 
that might have taken longer he knows the problems of a relatively 
small production having so recently done the glass menagerie 
with woodward as star he knew that we had to move swiftly there 
was a lot of hard work and long hours they accepted that sort of 
thing very well 
mr and mrs bridge was filmed in paris new york and canada 
for snow as well as kansas city it was an amazing feat on a 75 
million budget 
wouldnt it be easier for merchantivory to hook up with a major 
studio and let it worry about financing 
weve also hooked up with major companies and weve made 
exactly the film we wanted to make said ivory and it was 
certainly less of a headache for ismail 
the important thing is to have one source of money as we did 
on this picture said merchant today merchantivory has made 
about 28 films including tv the negatives belong to us if you 
have a studio deal the negatives belong to the studio 
inevitably there are clashes between art ivory and commerce 
merchant the director cited an instance on mr and mrs 
bridge he wanted a period fire engine for a scene in which a car 
is burned such a machine was available in kansas city but 
merchant didnt want to pay for it i finally convinced him it 
was necessary said ivory 
would merchant like to sit in the directors chair 
well im a good entrepreneur and organizer i like to take 
the challenge of producing the picture he replied i am going 
to direct a film which is set in india in custody i did the 
courtesans of bombay some years ago and a short film mahatma and 
the bad boy i must say i felt wonderful at the time because 
someone is taking all your orders doing all your things and you 
are the boss

a cultural thaw opened the way but it took 
10 years to put together a show of long stored masks weapons and 
ceremonial clothes used by the peoples of the frigid lands on both 
sides of the bering strait 
crossroads of continents cultures of siberia and alaska is 
a smithsonian institution traveling exhibit now at the gene autry 
western heritage museum in griffith park 
the idea for the exhibit of about 600 cultural artifacts arose 
as a bridge between the soviet union and the united states but the 
project endured some chilly times before the recent dramatic 
improvement in relations 
we were delayed because of political problems the exhibits 
curator william w fitzhugh said in an interview from his office 
in washington 
we were fighting against the image of the evil empire we 
were the test wave of glasnost said fitzhugh who is director of 
the smithsonians center for arctic studies 
sergei serov fitzhughs soviet counterpart and senior 
researcher with leningrads institute of ethnology said the 
project went well at their level we experienced no problems with 
cooperation between scholars he said 
the monumental task of uniting collections from the two 
countries started in 1978 when the soviet union became more 
receptive to scholarly exchanges fitzhugh said 
if you take a project of this geographic scope immensity you 
need time just to get familiar with the objects he said 
documentation takes many many hours and we had no funding from 
any american corporations 
fitzhugh and his team made several trips to the soviet union 
and russian researchers made similar trips here 
in musty dusty corners of museum warehouses attics and 
basements fitzhugh found items he had only read about from the 
years before the united states bought alaska from russia in 1867 
we were rediscovering collections that long had been in 
storage he said 
it is quite a task to pack to mount to dismount and check 
all the items and do condition checks and damage checks said 
serov we have been lucky that nothing has been seriously 
damaged 
enthusiasts who attend the display of jewelry ivory work 
masks religious costumes and everyday items like hunting and 
fishing tools walk into darkened rooms that create an arctic winter 
atmosphere 
the lighting is subdued due to the fragility of the artifacts 
some a century old the pieces are sensitive to light and could be 
permanently damaged if exposed 
the artifacts are made with vegetable and animal dyes and the 
peoples who created them were accustomed to throwing them away 
after they were used fitzhugh said 
things made for everyday use were expendable after a couple of 
months he added 
one example of the elaborate work is a siberian bucket made from 
the jawbone of a whale using bentwood techniques the jaw was 
soaked bent riveted and fastened to a wooden bottom the 
ornamental trim decorated the handle of what was believed to be a 
chamber pot 
the exhibit was unveiled in 1988 at the national museum of 
natural history in washington it also was displayed in seattle and 
new york in 1989 and was shown earlier this year in indianapolis 
it will be at the western heritage museum until feb 24 then it 
will move on to the anchorage museum of history and art in alaska 
and the canadian museum of civilization in ottawa 
in 1992 organizers hope to take the exhibit to the soviet union 
to cities including moscow leningrad and novosibirsk 
museum visitors who crave more soviet art can view the work of 
eight russian artists at the lori kaye gallery in garden grove the 
exhibit which opened nov 29 includes 40 watercolors by vasil 
panikarov most of them still lifes enabling him to escape the 
gloomy russian everyday life 
the exhibit also includes the window by the late alexander 
freyidin whose works are considered national treasures and 
restricted from leaving the country 
the other artists with works in the show are constantin filatov 
victor resovich lev michaelovich shmoys gavzdinskaya natalya 
teodorvna tchulvaloma and vera alexandra tchiyka 
another soviet exhibit keepers of the flame was organized 
by selma holo director of the university of southern californias 
fisher gallery open until jan 19 it will be taken to three other 
college campus galleries 
keepers of the flame is a show of 25 unofficial or 
underground artists before the era of glasnost artists who did 
not qualify to join the official artists union were not recognized 
and banned from public exhibit in 1975 the kgb dismantled an 
outdoor show of such art 
lori kaye said the soviet artists view of life is very 
different 
just getting art supplies in the soviet union is a test of an

success has has not been sweet for was not 
was 
for years they were a funny funky detroit band with singers 
sweet pea atkinson and sir harry bowens songwriters david and don 
was and a handful of listeners their first two albums bombed they 
spent much of the 1980s bouncing around europe 
that made sense to david and don perpetual outsiders pariahs 
with pride they expected mistreatment at the hands of the record 
industry theyd rather crash parties than be invited 
but for the past two years separately and together the wases 
couldnt lose walk the dinosaur and spy in the house of 
love were hit singles their third album what up dog went 
gold don was topped that by producing platinum records for bonne 
raitt and the b52s 
suddenly everybody wanted to know about was not was and when 
they got around to making their next record are you ok they 
felt selfconscious sensitive to the presence of spies in the 
house of was 
i actually feel this is a fine record said david 
interviewed with don was at a manhattan hotel but im glad we 
got rid of it the followup to a hit its like having a genius 
kid and the next kid grows up and all you can see is the new kid in 
the image of the older one i think the next one well lose the 
jitters the pressurell be off or something 
we thought we had a soft image nothing like we really were 
don added we went in the studio and the album took on a life of 
its own it was nothing like we planned 
after are you ok they may have to start crashing parties 
again the album has quickly vanished from the charts they knew 
they were in trouble from the first single a british aampr artist 
and repertoire man urged the wases to take advantage of their 
motown roots and topnotch singers why not cover that old 
temptations hit papa was a rollin stone 
they had performed the song in concert with great success so 
they gave it a shot in the studio sticking closely to the original 
version 
the single flopped 
don put a nice beat under it but otherwise it was 
fruitless david said the singers are too close they can do 
the temptations practically 
we liked the song it was a chance to pay homage to our soul 
roots and it was a way of making a statement about todays 
problems the only problem was having it represent us as the first 
single on the marketplace heres was not was and their first 
single is a cover maybe it was illadvised 
if success has had an effect its made them more philosophical 
more concerned about being taken seriously 
the problem they are funny very funny who else but was not 
was could get signed to their first contract with the help of a 
flattering letter from jazz critic david weiss aka david was 
who else would come up with titles such as i feel better than 
james brown and earth to doris and who else but david was 
would let his young son pick out a christmas tree and then help him 
steal it 
yet listen to love can be bad luck off what up dog or 
how the heart behaves from the new record in quieter moments 
theyre more likely to write lyrics such as these from love can 
be bad luck 
when two cars crash you just pull them apart but when lovers 
come to together they get tangled heart to heart 
when we saw walk the dinosaur work we saw what the world 
wanted us to and meant us to be cartoonish lovable black and 
white kind of a fun party band david explained 
we tried to resist that definition with all of our energy but 
in a way i think we set ourselves up for it in a way id like to 
have peter gabriels audience listening hard committed 
don fagenson and david weiss grew up in suburban detroit in the 
1960s their friendship sealed in eighth grade outside the 
principals office both were there on detention 
similar in their thinking the wases are easy to tell apart 
dons hair is dark and wavy davids is blond and frizzy don 
wears shades david doesnt davids voice is lower a stage 
whisper 
it was a matter of finding a sensibility with someone david 
said those were fairly strained times growing up bored in the 
suburbs what do you do with yourself 
wed go on poetry writing missions going to local shrines to 
a water tower at the mall this was our religious life then it 
burgeoned into fullblown productions when don started 
experimenting with tape recorders 
they formed the group in 1980 the name springing from the mouth 
of dons 2yearold son atkinson and bowen studio performers in 
detroit were recruited as singers 
david a history buff thinks was not was is going through its 
baroque phase a time of selfawareness when every song 
carries the weight of songs written before 
if this was our last record i would say we went out with a 
whimper and not a bang he said of are you ok but he 
dismisses the lull as birth pangs growing pains for a band 
with mixed feelings about growing up a time when the only way to 
go forward might be to take a giant step back 
i think and i dont really care if our company chrysalis 
reads this or not we would be so much better off if they got sick 
of us and said goodbye david said 
it would be nice to make records that didnt reflect having to 
recoup such an enormous amount for a company it would be nice 
if we could go back to the beginning and make a record for 
18000

the great gatsby is still one of geoffrey 
wolffs favorite books and narrator nick carraways insistence 
that he is inclined to reserve all judgments still makes the 
author laugh 
the novel is nothing but judgments wolff insists a young mans 
moral education carraway never stops evaluating gatsby or daisy or 
tom buchanan or himself he has an opinion on everything and his 
opinion is constantly shifting 
but wolff doesnt mean that as criticism he considers carraway 
the perfect writer an inspiration for his own books a man who 
both observes and participates making judgments and then changing 
them is part of the process a moral education for an author who 
learns something new with every word 
were told teachers tell us show dont tell show dont 
tell show dont tell i dont feel comfortable only showing i do 
want to tell when i have a judgment to sound off on wolff 
author of the duke of deception memories of my father 
providence and the new the final club said in an 
interview 
i think some things are right and some things are wrong i 
like to say when i think this person shouldnt have done something 
even at the oldfashioned primitive level that violates all the 
aesthetics for better or worse i feel thats something ive been 
doing 
the final club alfred a knopf 1995 is narrated by 
nathaniel clay a princeton university student class of 60 who 
leaves behind a troubled family life in seattle 
his education begins immediately on the eastbound empire 
builder train when he meets the beautiful diana pronounced 
deeahnah she emphasizes carr falling madly in love with a 
woman who either flirts with him or ignores him 
this is straight out of f scott fitzgerald a relationship much 
like the one in the short story winter dreams in which a caddy 
spots an 11yearold girl on a golf course and never looks at life 
the same way again 
even when nathaniel declares he will no longer pursue diana he 
admits he will always hold her up as some kind of ideal 
remembering her the night she showed up 42 minutes late for a 
meeting under the giant clock at manhattans grand central station 
 
nathaniel was past answering dianas questions she had asked 
at least one question too many but hed never forget the way she 
smelled and years later hed ask the snit behind the perfume 
counter at bendels to spray his palm with this scent and that 
scent hoping to find that smell and give it to the woman he was 
about to marry so that his wife would smell just as diana smelled 
tonight 
 
im interested in moments that change lives wolff 
explained its like that extraordinary ending to frank 
oconnors short story guests of a nation the last lines of the 
story are something like anything that happened afterwards i 
never felt the same about it again i want to write narratives in 
which that happens the world is one way before and one way 
after 
wolff was born in los angeles in 1937 and like nathaniel 
traveled east but this was not by choice as the author notes in 
duke of deception his father was a notorious con man racing 
from city to city just out of reach of angry creditors 
by the time wolff was old enough to go to college princeton he 
had lived all over the country and was estranged from his mother 
his parents had separated and his younger brother toby author 
tobias wolff who wrote of his own childhood in this boys 
life 
in 1968 geoffrey wolff wrote his first novel bad debts a 
story based on the relationship with his father who died in 1970 
after spending his final years in a sanitarium besides duke of 
deception wolff has since written four novels and the black 
sun a bleak study of poet harry crosby 
the final club takes nathaniel through his years at 
princeton offering judgments on fraternities writers and the 
elitist student body and into a troubled marriage 
the origin of the books title keeps shifting at first its an 
alternative club nathaniel forms with his princeton friends the 
name coming from a card game in which you can be defeated by 
holding the final club 
but the world changes and the title eventually means something 
much deeper that was the final club nathaniel thinks when he 
learns of a death in his family everyone was a member not 
exclusive in the least all comers were goers 
the book ends at the beginning with nathaniel looking ahead to 
the next time he can ponder the final club hes a middleaged 
man who knows his life will never be the same so all he can do is 
what wolff aims for himself behave well to others and try to 
maintain his capacity for wonder 
he has to a degree an obsession about time passing wolff 
said its like that wonderful line burt lancaster delivers in 
atlantic city he looks out over the boardwalk and says when i 
was a boy there was a real ocean its a line that breaks your 
heart

in a genre of music replete with songs 
about rebellious drinking and infidelity don williams is downright 
counterculture 
his songs are positive love ballads that also often glorify home 
and family 
so its no surprise that don williams new album is titled 
true love and its the typical williams form soothing 
uncluttered restrained the lp maintains williams 15year 
tradition as something of a country music paradox he sings 
uplifting love songs such as i believe in you youre my 
best friend and we should be together 
but dont expect him to play the new lp at his home on a 90acre 
ranch in neighboring cheatham county where he lives quietly and 
reclusively with his wife of 30 years the 51yearold williams has 
a detached attitude toward his music once its recorded rarely 
listening to his songs 
i think ive got a pretty good idea of what ive done after 
ive finished it he said in a rare interview im so critical 
of what i do that its just never been a part of the picture to sit 
around and relax with what ive done 
i dont watch the music popularity charts unless someone 
tells me what the sales are i dont know because thats history 
ive done that im always thinking more about what im going to do 
than what ive done 
he doesnt even know if his lp i believe in you was a 
million seller and theres also no need for adulation from fans 
i dont think im the kind of person whod go nuts if i didnt 
have another standing ovation or wasnt on stage to hear that 
applause he said 
the thing ive constantly been concerned about is i dont want 
to whip a dead horse im more than willing to step aside if the 
folks out there reach a point where theyve had enough of me 
as long as they want me to do it ill do it but i dont want 
to force the issue 
about his only concession to the country music lifestyle is a 
weatherbeaten cowboy hat one of four he owns thats constantly 
perched on his head i kid about it turning into a growth he 
said 
williams has had five gold albums sales of 500000 each 
greatest hits volume 1 expressions the best of don 
williams volume 11 portraits and i believe in you 
he has had concerts at carnegie hall in new york city royal 
albert hall in london and the sporting club in monte carlo among 
others he has made international appearances in belgium monaco 
germany spain wales scotland ireland france sweden england 
holland and finland 
he credits his popularity overseas to the universality of his 
music 
its universal as to how we feel about each other and what our 
needs in life are most of what i talk about is people and how they 
react to people he said 
williams also had a brief motion picture career in the 1970s 
appearing in two burt reynolds films ww amp the dixie 
dancekings and smokey amp the bandit ii hed like to do more 
film work 
williams a member of the pozo seco singers popfolk trio in the 
1960s has never been involved in even a whisper of controversy 
despite his high visibility as one of country musics top 
performers since the mid1970s 
im so bland im amazed people want to do interviews with 
me he said we live a pretty simple life and thats our 
preference we dont do a whole lot we go to church and we were 
involved in school activities when our kids were in school 
the first single released from true love is back in my 
younger days an uptempo song about the joy of getting older 
another cut lord have mercy on a country boy is a 
nostalgic piece about yearning to return to the dirtroad life of 
hunting wild turkeys and fishing 
in the song williams laments that a former meadow is now a 
parking lot for him its a rare reflection on a topical issue 
such as the environment 
i havent been given too much to that the political the 
religious but i do have very strong feelings about it

hiring plans of us companies will drop steeply to recession 
levels in the first quarter of 1991 particularly in the 
economically battered northeast the worlds largest temporary help 
firm says it found in a srvey 
manpower inc said sunday its sampling of more than 15000 
american businesses showed that 15 percent plan to increase hiring 
while 16 percent plan to reduce their workforces for a net hiring 
drop of 1 percent 
the firm said the net drop is the first shown by the survey 
since the first quarter of 1983 when the nation was still emerging 
from the last recession 
manpower said the 15 percent of firms intending to hire compares 
with 20 percent for the same period in 1990 the 16 percent 
planning work force cuts compares with 12 percent year earlier 
the survey substantiated a number of other recently released 
private and government statistical evidence that suggests the 
nation is sliding into a recession or already is immersed in one 
mitchell fromstein manpower president said the survey figures 
clearly show hiring activity is reaching recession depths in all 
regions except the midwest and is reflected in all business 
categories 
although the first quarter of any year historically is a time of 
low hiring activity fromstein said that even on a seasonally 
adjusted basis the hiring predicions for the quarter are down 
sharply 
the survey showed the deterioration to be most evident in the 
northeast where symptoms of recession have grown since the stock 
market crash of 1987 
the net hiring prediction for the area showed a net drop of 9 
percent vs a 3 percent advance a year earlier it is the lowest 
in the 15 year history of the survey and well below the recession 
levels of 198283 
by industry the survey showed the steepest declines in hiring 
plans were in the construction and retail trade sectors the survey 
showed a 9 percent advance in hiring plans in the service category 
which suggested service jobs will account for much of the total

federal agents have seized records of eastern 
airlines as part of an investigation into allegations that the 
troubled carrier failed to adequately inspect its airplanes for 
safety as recently as early november according to a published 
report 
thirty federal agents entered easterns miami headquarters on 
saturday after lawyers for eastern unsuccessfully tried to block 
the raid newsday reported sunday 
the seizure of hundreds of safety logs is tied to indictments 
against eastern handed down last july by a federal grand jury in 
brooklyn the newspaper reported the charges allege that the 
airline and nine of its former and current managers participated in 
a moneymaking scheme that allowed unsafe planes to fly 
the grand jury has received evidence that eastern failed to 
perform safety inspections properly as recently as early last 
month newsday said citing unidentified sources 
an eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said there have been 
allegations about the airlines safety inspections in the past and 
none of those have ever borne out 
the fact the search warrant was so broad indicates to us 
that theyre simply on a fishing expedition that theyre not 
seeking records that relate to specific allegations she added 
the indictments were based on testimony from informants the 
raid was the first seizure of documents under search warrants 
authorities obtained for easterns records newsday said 
newsday said us attorney andrew j maloney who is heading the 
investigation declined to comment on the report of the raid 
eastern attorneys who had somehow learned of the impending raid 
went before us district judge i leo glasser in brooklyn late 
friday asking him to stay the seizure glasser agreed to seal the 
affidavits supporting the governments plans for one week but let 
the raid go forward newsday said 
eastern has been operating under protection of us bankruptcy 
laws since last march it received a temporary reprieve last week 
when the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case agreed to the 
airlines request to use up to 135 million from an escrow fund to 
keep flying through the winter

world trade officials opened a final 
round of global trade talks today with a blunt reminder that the 
economic health of millions was riding on the outcome of their 
bargaining 
the world is expecting a great deal of you belgian prime 
minister wilfried martens told the delegates from nations attending 
the negotiating session of the 107nation uruguay round the most 
ambitious trade talks ever 
failure would deal world trade stability a nasty blow and 
would seriously harm the world economy he said at the heysel 
palaces exhibition complex on the outskirts of the belgian capital 
trade officials said 1650 officials from 96 nations were in 
attendance to launch the week of bargaining which has been 
threatened with failure by an acrimonious fight over cuts in 
government payments to farmers 
the dispute has pitted the european community and japan against 
the united states australia and others 
today the united states formally warned it may impose 
prohibitive tariffs on some imports from the european community 
unless the ec agrees to renew an accord on compensation for 
potential losses of us farm exports to spain and portugal 
us trade officials said the move could cost the 12nation 
community almost 420 million in exports 
thousands of farmers mostly europeans marched through brussels 
to show their opposition to any move to trim their support 
payments 
the negotiations which began in 1986 in the uruguayan resort of 
punta del este are designed to lower barriers to trade in 15 
areas including agriculture textiles manufactured goods and 
services such as banking transportation telecommunications and 
construction 
indonesias trade minister arifin siregar complained today 
that rich nations were hindering work on an overall agreement 
with a few days left in the uruguay round we are being 
confronted with a crisis situation mainly attributed to roadblocks 
put up by the majors he told the opening session 
he said if the problems were not solved quickly it would not 
be an exaggeration to say that the decay of the multilateral 
trading system has begun 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama whose nation is being 
pressed by the united states and others to lift its ban on rice 
imports called for a realistic solution to agricultural 
disputes japan argues that its ban on rice imports is essential to 
give the country selfsufficiency in its staple food 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter met sunday with trade 
officials from the european community and japan but reported no 
progress 
on on the eve of the talks officials stressed repeatedly that 
ending the fight over agriculture was key to a successful 
conclusion of the round 
the impasse there is poisoning other parts of the round 
said australian trade minister neal blewett chairman of the cairns 
group of 14 farmexporting nations 
the bush administration backed by australia argentina brazil 
and others wants the european community to snip away much of its 
costly farm support system making cuts ranging from 75 percent to 
90 percent but the europeans have refused to budge from a 30 
percent cut in limited areas 
ray macsharry the ecs top farm official however told 
reporters that there is substantial common ground in some areas 
of negotiation 
france and germany have been the communitys main opponents to 
further reductions but there is speculation that the germans who 
had been anxious about the farm vote prior to sundays elections 
might give in some now that the balloting is over 
blewett predicted the farm issue would come to a head in the 
first two days of the conference 
on another dispute officials reported some progress in an 
effort to write new rules for trade in various service industries 
such as banking and insurance 
canadian trade minister john crosbie said his country with the 
support of several other nations was expected to offer a proposal 
for removing barriers to trade in financial services he said the 
measure has the support of the united states and the common market 
the uruguay round is the eighth in a series of negotiating 
sessions designed to reduce tariffs and lower barriers to global 
trade the negotiations are sponsored by the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade which was created in 1947 as a forum and an 
agreement to freer world trade

arena for the first time 
its used in housing cases and used by other state agencies 
and i couldnt see why it couldnt be used by the commission 
evan j kemp jr chairman of the equal employment opportunity 
commission said in a telephone interview sunday 
testers or individuals from minority and womens groups 
who historically have been victims of discrimination have posed 
as renters or home buyers to win housing discrimination suits 
the supreme court in 1982 said such activities were legal even 
if the testers did not intend to rent or buy 
however the government never has used the testimony of testers 
to prosecute job discrimination cases 
kemp said the new commission policy announced friday would 
address one of the weaknesses of the eeoc system 
people that apply for a job in answer to a newspaper ad can be 
discriminated against and they wont know it under current 
circumstances kemp said 
the eeoc chairman said he was confident his agency has the legal 
authority to bring the cases because the courts address this all 
the time and make a determination whether an employer has 
discriminated or not 
representatives of the business community could not be reached 
for comment sunday on the new policy 
but stephen bokat of the us chamber of commerce told the 
washington post that proving the case of job bias against an 
employment tester would be infinitely more difficult than it is 
in the housing context

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
united states remained unchanged this week at 1175 following a 
healthy rebound the week before baker hughes inc reported monday 
the number of rigs had plummeted by 41 in late november 
following heavy rains in oklahoma then rebounded last week by 72 
as weather improved and the endofyear seasonal upturn began a 
year ago this week the number of working rigs was 1062 
decreases in the previous weeks followed a milestone earlier in 
the month when the number of working rigs reached 1144 a figure 
not seen since dec 28 1987 
baker hughes has kept track of the rig count the widely 
watched index of drilling activity since 1940 the count 
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil not those 
producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
oklahoma led the major oil producing states for the week adding 
13 rigs to the count followed by pennsylvania which added six 
michigan which added 2 and north dakota and ohio which each 
added one 
louisiana led the states reporting losses for the week with 
nine fewer working rigs louisiana was followed by texas whose 
count dropped by 8 wyoming and colorado which each lost two rigs 
and california and kansas whose counts each dropped by one 
new mexicos count remained unchanged for the week

the patent and trademark office today 
recognized an aroma as a subject for trademark registration for the 
first time it granted a trademark to the scent of a line of 
embroidery yarns and threads 
the office approved registration of a scent described by its 
developer celia clarke of goleta calif as a highimpact 
fresh floral fragrance reminiscent of plumeria blossoms 
ms clarkes application was initially turned down on grounds 
the products fragrance did not qualify for a trademark the ruling 
was overturned on sept 19 by the trademark trial and appeal board 
this marks the first time in the history of trademarks that a 
fragrance has been approved for registration said jeffrey m 
samuels assistant commissioner for trademarks we are all 
familiar with what trademarks look like now well see what they 
smell like 
approval of the registration was published in todays trademark 
official gazette members of the public have 30 days in which to 
oppose registration if no opposition is filed the registration 
will be issued on feb 26 
more than one million trademarks have been registered since the 
first trademark law was passed in 1870 about 600000 of them are 
still in use a trademark registration lasts 10 years and can be 
renewed indefinitely 
david sams chairman of the trademark trial and appeal board 
said ms clarke and her associates maintained that the fragrance 
was in fact the trademark by which their product could be 
distinguished from other peoples thread and yarn 
sams said the boards reasoning in granting the application was 
that there was no natural fragrance to yarn and no evidence that 
it was a common practice or a practice of anybody else at all in 
the industry to make their yarn scented so that it stood out and 
was distinctive to this particular producer of yarn 
he said the board said in a footnote to its decision that it was 
not passing any judgment on registerability of a scent or 
fragrance on products which are noted for those features like 
perfumes and household products we left for another day whether a 
party could register a particular scent for a product sold for its 
scent 
we are here talking about an unusual application of a scent to 
a product sams said 
ms clarke reached by telephone in goleta said the firm a 
manufacturer of punch embroidery needles has been in business 15 
years she said the application for trademark was submitted about 
two years ago when the company began producing the scented yarn 
we are a small company so we havent done a big lot with it 
although we do intend to she said i think we will really push 
it now and show it more she said

the european community commission at 
the request of several member states will soon propose a total ban 
on tobacco ads on billboards and in the print media officials said 
monday 
the request for a total ban came after the 12 ec health 
ministers at a meeting here rejected a proposal to toughen curbs 
on tobacco ads in nations with relatively lax rules on such 
advertising 
sources said germany britain and the netherlands argued the 
proposal would not harmonize tobacco advertising rules across the 
ec as france italy and spain already have complete bans 
the current proposal has lived its day and died said 
italian health minister franco de lorenzo who chaired the meeting 
this will not be reanimated 
the measure that was rejected envisaged strict controls on the 
content of tobacco ads in the print media and on billboards and 
offered a choice of 14 specific health warnings 
all ec nations ban tobacco commercials on television and three 
ban tobacco ads from the print media 
all delegations agree that it is necessary to take measures to 
reduce tobacco consumption de lorenzo told reporters

a judge on monday tightened the terms of bail 
for indicted financier charles h keating jr after prosecutors 
complained that the former lincoln savings and loan owner couldnt 
be found over the thanksgiving weekend 
superior court judge lance ito ordered the district attorneys 
office and keatings attorneys to set up a schedule specifying the 
day and hour at which keating can be reached by telephone each 
week 
the order differs from one set earlier by a federal judge by 
establishing the specific time for a call 
that way you dont have to play phone tag with each other 
ito said 
keating free on 300000 bail is charged with 46 counts of 
fraud alleging he misled investors into believing that highyield 
highrisk bonds issued by the lincoln parent american continental 
corp were safe the indictment says buyers many of them elderly 
people investing their life savings lost some 200 million 
the bonds became worthless in april 1989 when american 
continental sought bankruptcy protection lincoln was seized the 
following day by federal regulators experts say its failure will 
cost taxpayers 2 billion the largest savings and loan bailout to 
date 
ito postponed until jan 11 discussion of an amended indictment 
that revises 20 of 42 original counts against keating and adds four 
counts 
the case is scheduled to go to trial feb 3 but deputy district 
attorney william hodgman said that date probably would be postponed 
until spring 
in documents filed friday keatings attorneys said their client 
could not be located during the thanksgiving weekend because he had 
changed his home phone number in the phoenix area to an unlisted 
number 
conditions of bail set by us district judge john davies 
required keating to be available for a weekly phone call from the 
district attorneys office but did not set a specific time 
hodgman said keating violated the orders of bail by not advising 
his office of the new number 
we want to know where mr keating is hodgman said mr 
keatings got to play by the same rules as any other defendant 
keating appeared for the hearing but declined to talk to 
reporters 
his attorney stephen neal criticized the senate ethics 
committee which has been conducting hearings into the relationship 
between keating and five senators for declining to grant keating 
immunity in exchange for testimony 
neal said it was impossible for the committee to learn the truth 
without hearing from keating 
it is far more important that the committee gets to the bottom 
of what is going on with campaign contributions than the ability or 
inability of the federal government to prosecute anybody neal 
said

shopping mall patrons across the land are 
screaming the same question do the kids think they own the place

out though has proved a dubious solution theres money in those

with christmas shoppers breathing down their necks the people 
who run the nations almost 35000 shopping centers have an eye out 
these days for the droves of teenagers whose high jinks sometimes 
explode in violence and whose presence sometimes intimidates other 
shoppers 
about a dozen shopping centers and malls have gone so far as to 
ban teenagers entirely at critical hours 
and even those that havent are looking for ways to cope with 
youngsters who have adopted the comfortable and elegant mall 
surroundings as second homes 
at its fall meeting in kansas city mo the international 
council of shopping centers held a seminar titled hanging out 
whose shopping mall is it anyway 
at mckinley mall in hamburg ny 15 miles from buffalo no one 
under 20 is allowed inside between 6 pm and 10 pm on fridays 
and saturdays unless they are reporting for work or are 
accompanied by an adult 
the mall took the action after an estimated 600 teens inundated 
the malls food court one friday night and a fight in the parking 
lot spilled over into the common area 
at the randall park mall in north randall ohio the operators 
dont allow unescorted teens at any hour even teenagers going to 
the theater must be brought and picked up 
omahas park fair has banned people under 18 
beyond those shopping centers which have banned teens far more 
have reported trouble controlling teen crowds that clog common 
areas block store entrances and generally if inadvertently 
intimidate customers 
but banning teens has also posed an ironic conflict teens are 
good customers they spend a lot of money 
mall operators say the problems stem from changes in the 
community a growing number of twoincome latchkey families and the 
cuts made in school budgets leaving the teens no place to go when 
the closing bell rings they are a new kind of temporarily 
homeless and the mall is a haven 
the scene at aurora mall outside denver colo this christmas 
is a study in contrast to a year ago 
this year there are teenage advisory boards at all eight high 
schools in the malls neighborhood and each of these sends a 
representative to a super advisory board that meets once a month at 
the mall 
these youngsters with adult advisors drawn from the community 
help devise programs that can help revise adult perceptions about 
teenagers 
so this christmas they will field customer service ambassadors 
drawn from the high schools who will help adult customers with 
their parcels with directions to shops and try to change adult 
attitudes to the teenage presence there will also be teenagers 
available at the mall to wrap christmas presents for customers 
consider last year mall operators began to notice a growing 
number of youngsters in the spring of 1989 susan keene general 
manager says they were congregating in large groups acting out 
in loud fashion and otherwise horsing around we started 
receiving complaints from our adult shoppers on mondays following 
the weekends 
so in order to get rid of the problem and get rid of it fast 
we instituted a gettough policy in the fall of 1989 it was a kind 
of steamroller approach 
youngsters were handed walletsized cards with rules of behavior 
on them no behavior likely to cause a disturbance no sitting on 
planter walls no alcoholic beverages no blocking store entrances 
after two weeks notice they were given one warning and then 
photographed and banned recalcitrants were arrested by local 
police and charged with trespass 
the mall was banning 10 to 15 youngsters every saturday 
but it didnt work there was no decrease in teenagers coming 
to the mall harassment was not the answer furthermore the mall 
became the target of a boycott and pickets from the black 
community which perceived the tactic as being aimed at their 
children 
while only about 20 percent of aurora mall shoppers were 
africanamerican says manager keene about 75 percent of the 
kids who come to the mall are africanamerican 
clearly something else had to be done the mall began with a 
marketing survey intercepting youngsters and holding discussion 
groups to find out just who they were what they found was 
something of a surprise

the teens and their parents they discovered had a sense of 
ownership of the mall even though it was private property they 
felt it was their right to congregate there not just to shop the 
youngsters came to be with their friends to make dates to find 
out where the parties were all of this in lieu of a school 
environment which had suffered from budget cuts 
the mall offered an elegant and inexpensive focus for the 
youngsters and in some cases a place they perceived as being safer 
than their own neighborhoods the youngsters concerned about gang 
activity in the community saw the mall as safe haven 
stephen huber of a cleveland firm that manages a number of 
malls says that on one occasion three teen gang members were 
standing at an entrance to the mall when four members of a rival 
gang drove by the four turned the car around got a running start 
jumped the curb and crashed into the entrance in an attempt to run 
down their rivals 
oddly gang activity is easier to deal with than the teen 
problem shopping center operators say because the police know who 
they are and what to do about them 
not so the average teens the market survey showed that the 
teens visited the aurora mall one to three times a week visited an 
average of 10 stores and spent an average of 64 a visit most of 
them had sincere career aspirations and in spite of their bizarre 
dress and behavior were basically good kids 
so the mall operators set about changing their own mindset and 
that of security people just because kids had intimidating 
appearances and numbers it didnt mean they were bad or that they 
were any more bizarre than previous generations 
the mall also hired a customer service director whose job is 
more public relations than security which also comes under his 
purview the accent is on politeness requests to move on or 
please dont block the store front it seems to be working 
and the city of aurora put a highly visible police ministation 
in the heart of the mall 
there was a similar impasse at the columbia mall in columbia 
sc where a heavyhanded approach eventually yielded to gentler 
means without knowing it the mall operator had used a strong but 
old south carolina law that permits the banning of people from 
private property for six months under penalty of law 
they used the law frequently but then discovered it had been 
passed as a tool for segregationists there was a community uproar 
now the mall has a polite customer service corps neatly dressed 
people in blazers and carrying radios and directories of stores 
they help customers with parcels give directions and act as new 
sets of eyes and ears as they roam around the mall 
the emergence of the mall as a prime community focal point has 
been growing throughout the nation each year the number of malls 
and floor space has been growing about 7 percent a year drawing 
1724 million adults 70 percent of the population 
malls and shopping centers now number 34683 and more than 
1500 new ones were started in 1989 one near minneapolis plans to 
house about 600 stores 
so the teen problem can be expected to grow 
most expect teen banning to abate however teens are a growing 
56 billion market and this has not passed unnoticed 
bans quite naturally have alienated teens at the mckinley mall 
in hamburg ny 15yearold jan harris says a lot of kids who 
are here are straight the reason they turn away people is that 
theyre different she was banned from the mall when she sat on a 
bench to rest is that a valid reason to kick someone out she 
asked 
by and large mckinley merchants say the ban has not affected 
business as much as they feared 
ron jefferson who runs the singing river mall in gautier 
miss which attracts as many as 200 teens on a weekend has put in 
an outside entrance to the game rooms to divert traffic he has 
also put in extra security and more phones at the theaters on 
visits to local schools he reminds teens that they are potential 
mall employees as well as patrons 
malls have been havens for teenagers almost from the beginning 
in fact mall owners took pains to attract them with movie theaters 
game rooms record stores the difference today is their sheer 
numbers 
managers are trying innovations to attract teens one offers 
vacant space to a church group which has set up dropin 
counseling another features fashion shows with high school 
students as models 
says one manager when i was a kid i didnt have an american 
express card but these kids do they spend a lot of money here

steel importers have taken a bad rap for 
dumping products in the united states when the real culprit is 
volatility in world currency markets a trade group said monday 
the american institute for imported steel contended that the 
price discrepancies often seen in foreign steel are in many 
instances due to unpredictable changes in the dollars value 
against foreign currencies 
in recent months the dollar has fluctuated dramatically on world 
currenyy markets amid a weakening of the us economy and the 
growing potential for war in the persian gulf 
under present antidumping rules throughout the world 
international traders can become targets of expensive litigation 
for reasons entirely beyond their control said john griffin the 
institutes president at a news conference in new york where the 
group was holding an annual meeting 
dumping is the practice of selling foreign goods at unfairly 
low prices in order to grab a bigger share of the market it is 
considered a violation of import rules in the united states and 
many other countries 
there has been widespread concern in the steel industry about 
what domestic producers call foreign dumping of steel in the united 
states once one of the worlds mightiest steelmakers but now a 
major importer 
to remedy what it called a potentially serious problem the 
steelimport institute proposed an agreement under which 
governments apply a 10year average to exchange rates to be used in 
calculating costs and prices 
the proposal an amendment to existing antidumping rules would 
strengthen the law by sharpening focus on truly predatory acts of 
international price discrimination unrelated to shifting exchange 
rates said griffin 
it was unclear if the proposal would win the necessary 
international support backers hope to introduce it in negotiations 
next year 
institute members said dumping accusations were worsening with 
the dollars recent plunge in value which were increasing imported 
steels dollar value but not giving the price charged in the united 
states enough time to catch up 
as a result steel importers are being accused of technical 
dumping in cases brought against them by us steel manufacturers 
group members said 
american companies brought roughly 395 cases against importers 
between 1980 and 1989 a dramatic increase from earlier years said 
kermit almstedt an attorney representing the trade group 
almstedt said he did not know how many of those lawsuits were 
prompted by technical dumping but added one of the reasons 
youre seeing a lot of cases against the japanese is a result of 
the exchange rates 
importers found charging unfairly low prices for their products 
can be slapped with a tarrif equal to the difference between what 
they charged and the products perceived fair market price 
almstedt said 
steel importers fear a big litigation problem in 1992 with 
president bushs planned lifting of the system of voluntary 
restraint agreements which for the past five years has curbed 
imports of steel from most major supplying countries into the 
united states 
the potential for a subsequent flood of steel imports into the 
united states could prompt a backlash from domestic steel 
manufacturers members said

in a postelection warning the president of 
germanys powerful central bank said monday that drastsic 
government spending cuts are needed to offset the costs of 
unification 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl said in a magazine 
interview that the government plans to borrow too much money to 
rebuild the crippled eastern part of the newly united nation 
poehl whose comments were confirmed by the banks press 
department said far reaching and drastic government spending 
cuts were needed to offset the borrowing 
johann wilhelm gaddum a director of the bank also criticized 
the governments plans 
with chancellor helmut kohls election victory now history from 
bars to boardrooms germans are returning to a main topic of 
conversation how much will it cost to bail out economically 
backward eastern germany 
among the possible ways to pay the massive bill are cutting 
government spending or going further into debt neither is popular 
and either could eventually lead kohl into trouble despite his 
sunday reelection 
the influential news magazine der spiegel said the total 
government debt could reach 860 billion by next year leading to 
worries that todays unification joy will become tomorrows debts 
for future generations 
estimates of how much it will cost to give eastern germans a 
western standard of living reach into the hundreds of billions of 
dollars 
eastern workers are anxious to have their salaries brought up to 
western levels and a recent railroad strike could be a sign of 
trouble to come 
for now kohls government plans to run up the national debt to 
pay for unification bills 
that decision drew poehls remarks the central bank president 
told stern magazine that the governments plan to borrow between 
93 billion and 100 billion in 1991 was too high 
the growing deficit is driving up interest rates and thus 
borrowing costs for ordinary germans who want loans for cars homes 
and other items 
chancellor kohl needs poehls backing to complete a full and 
swift merger of capitalist western germany with the formerly 
communist eastern part of the country the bundesbank president is 
probably the single most important figure in guiding the economy in 
this nation of 78 million people 
during the summer poehl expressed reservations about kohls 
plans to exchange much of east germanys virtually worthless money 
into west german marks at a 1to1 rate poehl later went along 
despite his misgivings 
the bundesbank is especially vigilant in monitoring german 
monetary policy keeping a special watch out for economic moves 
that could drive up inflation 
gaddum the bundesbank director responsible for eastern germany 
said monday that officials dont understand repeated warnings about 
the dangers of high government borrowing 
when i look at the planned growth rates of the public budgets 
for 1991 i have doubts whether the message has been understood 
the director said in an interview on germanys ard television 
network 
the comments from the two bundesbank officials could cause 
trouble for kohl under increasing criticism for planning to borrow 
too much 
finance minister theo waigel has said the borrowing will be 
raised only to the point justifiable by german unification 
then in the course of mediumterm financial planning we have 
to reduce the debt again so that the repayment of interest and 
principal dont become too great later on waigel said on 
election night 
oskar lafontaine the unsuccessful candidate for chancellor from 
the social democratic party has repeatedly accused kohl of 
slipshod financial planning for the oct 3 german merger

employees were lowkey and passengers seemed 
mostly oblivious monday after the parent of continental airlines 
filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws for the second 
time in seven years 
im not worried as long as i can get home today gwendolyn 
currie of fort lauderdale fla said 
her flight to new orleans was detoured to houston because of bad 
weather and she was among the crowd waiting for continental flights 
at houston intercontinental airports terminal c the houstonbased 
airlines main hub 
i just hope to get out of here today she said 
i hope i still have a way to get back said frank dow who 
was heading to lafayette la from houston 
some continental employees were handed a printed message about 
the filing when they reported to work monday morning and a text of 
the announcement was made availabletto others on computer monitors 
at passenger checkin gates 
passenger reaction to the announcement was minimal gate 
attendants said probably because so few people knew of it the 
airline company said it intended to run normally despite the 
chapter 11 filing in a federal bankruptcy court in delaware where 
continental is incorporated 
the impact is zero said one flight officer who declined to 
be identified saying employees are told to not speak with 
reporters its business as usual 
look around he said pointing to aircraft taxiing and 
passengers boarding i dont have any anxiety 
this is something external with the fuel prices a flight 
attendant with him said its all out of our control and theres 
very little i can do i think its important the public recognizes 
this is an administrative action thats whats important if you 
didnt watch the news you would never know 
the flight officer who said he went through the 1983 bankruptcy 
filing when flights were halted employees laid off and passengers 
stranded noted the chaos of that time was absent on monday 
its very relaxed he said this was a whole different 
background 
capt robert finley a senior pilot at continental said he was 
among four top pilots to meet with airline chairman and president 
hollis harris on thursday to discuss the situation 
continental airlines is going to wind up surviving and being a 
leader in the industry finley said mr harris is a very 
positive peopleoriented person which is something we havent 
known a lot of around continental for awhile 
it seems like a breath of fresh air to see a man like him in 
that job if anyone can pull us through these difficult times 
where fuel costs are skyrocketing and all costs are elevating at an 
enormous rate while the fares are still being depressed and the 
fare wars are going on i think mr harris is the guy who can do 
it 
finley said he was not nervous about his future 
i went through the last one he said that one made me 
nervous but this i feel is necessary and is a positive move to 
strengthen the company so we can move forward 
if i was an employee id really be concerned passenger 
robert cloud of houston said 
cloud was a reluctant continental passenger and was sent to the 
airline on monday by united airlines when his united flight was 
canceled 
i had heard they were having problems he said while waiting 
to fly to san francisco and then bangkok its one of those 
hazards 
i can just go to another airline said archie buchanan 
flying to phoenix filing chapter 11 doesnt normally mean youre 
going to quit flying at least for the short term 
i think were too tired right now to worry beverly zigal 
of austin who was heading for belize central america 
hopefully well get back itll be interesting to see what 
transpires in the next few days i hope it hits the newspapers down 
there but well be off on some remote island fishing 
as long as we get there well probably get back added her 
companion jane bessent 
ive been through it three times before with other carriers 
said one continental flight officer who refused to provide his 
name but said he was based in newark you position yourself its 
a little bit of a surprise and its kind of strange to hear this 
from a reporter

a strong rally in the soybean and soybean product 
markets helped lift grain futures prices to a higher close monday 
on the chicago board of trade 
the surge began in the soybean oil pit after a large number of 
delivery notices were cancelled indicating soybean oil supplies 
for delivery against the december contract may be tighter than 
previously thought 
steve freed grains analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago said the soybean complex also may have been boosted by 
reports that germany plans to sell at least some of its excess 
soybean crushing capacity to the soviet union 
such an increase in european crushing activity would likely 
translate into increased demand for us soybeans because the 
europeans must import all the beans they use 
we know brazil is basically out and the argentinias are 
running out so the only store left in town would be the united 
states freed said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 247 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with december at 230 a bushel 
oats were cent lower to 1 cents higher with december at 113 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 11 cents higher with january at

atlantic richfield co sued more than 70 
insurance carriers for reimbursement of the huge costs of restoring 
50 hazardous waste sites polluted over six decades company 
officials said monday 
experts said the case will help set precedents for insurers and 
companies nationwide it stems from a california supreme court 
ruling two weeks ago that the cost of cleaning up toxic pollution 
is part of the damages to be paid by insurers under standard 
comprehensive general liability policies 
arco the big los angelesbased oil company also is asking to 
have the duties and liabilities of both companies and insurers 
clarified under the state supreme court ruling 
arco believes that this action will bring the questions of 
insurance coverage and compensation before a single forum for 
orderly and efficient resolution and administration arco said in 
a statement 
supreme courts in massachusetts minnesota washington and north 
carolina have made similar rulings in recent months 
thecase decided nov 15 said insurance companies that provide 
property coverage must pay their policyholders costs of cleaning 
up toxic waste at government order the case was brought against 
aiu insurance co and other insurers after fmc a chicagobased 
chemical and weapons company was sued by federal and local 
agencies for allegedly polluting land and water at 79 sites in a 
number of states 
the unanimous state supreme court ruling was broad but not 
allinclusive carriers have legal defenses that include gross 
negligence or willful misconduct by the insured many recent 
policies also exclude all but sudden and accidental instances 
of pollution 
companies affected by superfund legislation all over the nation 
are checking old policies to see if they can escape liability for 
increasingly expensive toxic cleanup work said joel moskowitz a 
partner specializing in environmental law with the gibson dunn amp 
crutcher firm in los angeles 
steve wasdick a spokesman for aetna casualty and surety co of 
america said suits over toxic waste liability have frequently 
wound up in court and often turn on the language of the policy by 
the early 1970s many carriers included pollution exclusion 
clauses to avoid liability except when an incident was sudden and 
accidental 
there have been a good number that have gone the insurers way 
too wasdick said 
among the carriers named as defendants in arcos lawsuit are 
aetna firemans fund insurance travelers insurance lloyds of 
london and more than 20 other foreign companies 
the defendants issued policies as far back as the 1930s to arco 
and its predecessor companies anaconda co richfield oil corp 
sinclair oil corp and atlantic refining co 
arco spokesman albert greenstein said its too early to predict 
the effect of the companys suit filed nov 23 because the 
supreme court ruling opened new ground 
greenstein also said its too early to tell the total costs of 
the cleanups it goes back so far and involves so many cases that 
its impossible to say he said 
the us environmental protection agency estimates the average 
costs of cleaning up a superfund site has grown from 9 million to 
25 million during the past five years however a recent study by 
the rand corp think tank in santa monica found that the vast 
majority cost far less than that

a smell can be registered as a trademark just 
as a word name symbol color or sound can be the patent and 
trademark office said in a groundbreaking decision monday 
the office approved registration of the scent of a type of 
embroidery yarn and sewing thread produced by clarkes osewez 
pronounced oh sew easy of goleta calif 
according to an exhibit in the case the yarn can be used to 
make among other things a scented skunk 
if nobody objects within 30 days the registration will be 
issued on feb 26 
a trademark is defined by law as any word name symbol or 
device or any combination of such things that is used to 
distinguish a product from the products sold or manufactured by 
others 
in an earlier case the color pink was recognized as a trademark 
for a type of fiberglass insulation the trademark was granted in 
the mid1980s to the owenscorning corp whose fiberglas product 
is pink 
sound marks such as the nbc chimes also have been registered 
there had not previously been a case however in which a 
trademark was granted for an aroma 
we are all familiar with what trademarks look like said 
jeffrey m samuels assistant commissioner for trademarks now 
well see what they smell like 
what this one smells like said celia clarke of clarkes osewez 
is a high impact fresh floral fragrance reminiscent of 
plumeria blossoms 
trademark examining attorney david cline had refused the 
registration on grounds that consumers were likely to regard the 
scent as just a pleasant feature of the yarn and not an indication 
of its origin 
ms clarke argued that customers dealers and distributors 
throughout the embroidery field recognized the firm as the source 
of scented embroidery yarn and thread 
she submitted as part of the record a kit containing yarn and 
thread for making a scented skunk 
the trademark trial and appeal board in a decision handed down 
sept 19 said ms clarke was the only person who had marketed 
yarns and threads with a fragrance 
under the circumstances of this case we see no reason why a 
fragrance is not capable of serving as a trademark to identify and 
distinguish a certain kind of product the board said 
it should be noted that we are not here talking about the 
registrability of scents or fragrances of products which are noted 
for those features such as perfumes colognes or scented household 
products it added in a footnote 
oscar mastin a spokesman for the patent and trademark office 
said perfumes can be patented and their names registered as 
trademarks 
j david sams chairman of the board said the case was the 
first in which copyright registration had been sought for a scent 
the company advertises its product as clarkes distinctive 
sofscented yarns they are of the type known in the trade as 
russian embroidery or punch embroidery 
ms clarke reached by telephone in goleta said the firm a 
manufacturer of punch embroidery needles has been in business 15 
years she said the application for trademark was submitted about 
two years ago when the company began producing the scented yarn 
we are a small company so we havent done a big lot with it 
although we do intend to she said i think we will really push 
it now and show it more 
more than 1 million trademarks have been registered since the 
first trademark law was passed in 1870 about 600000 of them are 
still in use a trademark registration lasts 10 years and can be 
renewed indefinitely

frank lorenzo is no longer boss at continental 
airlines but the carrier he shaped is following a road he traveled 
in the early 1980s when continental first sought refuge under 
federal bankruptcy laws 
on monday continental airlines holdings inc filed for 
protection for a second time blaming the move on the recent runup 
in fuel costs and heavy debts accrued in the 1980s 
lorenzo the 50yearold entrepreneur who came to symbolize a 
tumultuous decade of airline deregulation announced in august he 
was selling off most of his stake in continental to scandinavian 
airlines system 
he also resigned as chairman and chief executive at continental 
replaced by hollis harris a respected manager lured from rival 
delta air lines inc 
just two weeks ago in his first public remarks since departing 
continental lorenzo warned that the troubles in the airline 
industry could leave just three or four major airlines within three 
years 
and if you dont like air fares today just hold on to your 
hats you may not have seen anything yet in terms of air fare 
price increases he said 
the predecessor to continental holdings was texas air corp 
which lorenzo built into the nations largest airline operator 
parenting continental and eastern airlines the growth of texas air 
began in 1966 when lorenzo and harvard university classmate robert 
carney formed a financial advisory firm 
even before that in 1963 lorenzos first professional job was 
in the industry when he was hired by trans world airlines as a 
financial analyst within two years he was manager of the 
financial analysis department at eastern 
in 1968 the lorenzocarney duo created jet capital corp which 
bought a controlling interest in texas international airlines in 
1972 lorenzo then 32 a harvard mba and son of spanish immigrants 
from queens ny was the carriers youngest president 
in 1981 lorenzo merged texas international with continental 
after a bitter takeover battle his image as a union buster began 
when he fought organized labor at continental and won 
the image grew in 1983 when he put continental then the 
nations eighthlargest airline under bankruptcy protection 
scrapped labor contracts and hired strike replacements at lower 
pay 
lorenzo subsequently acquired new york air people express and 
frontier airlines which were merged into continental 
he didnt face another labor fight until he acquired eastern in 
1986 where his relationship with unions was acrimonious and a 
strike against the airline made him the target of union members 
hatred 
using billions of dollars in borrowed money and cheap fares 
continental and eastern once highcost airlines helped texas air 
become the nations largest airline operator capturing about 20 
percent of the domestic market 
but with bitter resistance from the unions particularly at 
eastern both airlines came under extreme financial pressure and 
there were doubts about easterns ability to survive 
after the strike hamstrung eastern in 1989 eastern sought 
bankruptcy court protection and is still operating under the 
supervision of a court trustee who replaced lorenzo in april 
it was then that continental began a quiet hunt for a new 
leader a search that resulted in the hiring of harris 
its been perfectly obvious to me that i personally have 
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has 
taken lorenzo said in announcing his departure

oil prices seesawed but finished slightly 
higher monday as traders saw dimmed peace hopes in the persian 
gulf 
light sweet crude oil settled at 2915 per barrel up 30 cents 
on the new york mercantile exchange on contracts for january 
delivery price tumbled 406 a barrel friday when president bush 
proposed facetoface discussions with ranking iraqi officials 
it was coming back from a bit of an overreaction on friday 
said ed kevelson a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
speculation of a possible diplomatic solution to the persian 
gulf crisis pushed crude futures to their second sharpest drop 
since iraq invaded kuwait in august 
crude fell monday on hints of peace and rose on hints of war 
but stayed slightly higher all day it rose as much as 163 per 
barrel but near the end of trading crude was only 20 cents 
higher 
we had selling as it appeared the peace winds were blowing 
said analyst bob baker at prudentialbache securities inc 
prices fell after the state department said only us and iraqi 
officials would participate in the proposed talks later this month 
which traders interpreted as a sign of progress toward peace 
but crude began rising again after defense secretary dick cheney 
said sanctions against iraq might not be sufficient to get iraqi 
troops out of kuwait 
war in the middle east would threaten crucial world oil 
supplies making crude more expensive 
crude for delivery in later months fell as those contracts moved 
to catch up with the losses suffered by january crude on friday 
later months had been held back by daily decline limits intended to 
lessen risks faced by oil traders

cents on contracts for january delivery home heating oil settled 
at 8467 cents a gallon down 375 cents on contracts for january 
delivery later contract months were down for both products 
some analysts were surprised that unleaded gasoline showed more 
weakeness than home heating oil baker suggested traders might have 
been responding belatedly to higher federal gasoline taxes imposed 
over the weekend 
natural gas prices which are not affected by the mideast 
standoff since it does not threaten supplies were higher monday 
contracts for january delivery rose 3 cents to 2475 per 1000 
cubic feet later contracts rose moderately

business continued to slow at the nations 
industrial firms in november extending a decline that is likely to 
continue for some time the national association of purchasing 
management said monday 
private economists agreeing with the trade groups assessment 
predicted the downturn will continue until interest rates come down 
and the middle east crisis is resolved 
the purchasing managers said production and new orders both 
dropped pushing the groups index of economic activity down to 
413 percent from 434 percent in october 
the latest monthly decline was the fifth in a row sending the 
index to its lowest point since november 1982 during the last 
recession 
when the index registers below 50 percent it indicates the 
manufacturing economy is declining and when it drops below 44 
percent it points to a shrinking of the overall economy 
the survey results substantiated other statistical evidence that 
the economys health has worsened including a commerce department 
report monday on construction spending 
the department said spending for new building rose 13 percent 
in october the first gain in three months but the advance was 
largely due to new school and sewer projects spending on 
residential and nonresidential buildings continued to fall 
overall residential nonresidential and government spending 
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4344 billion up 
from 4289 billion in september 
alan levinson an economist with wefa group a private economic 
forecasting service based in bala cynwd pa said the purchasing 
managers results confirm the fact that we are slipping deeper 
into recession 
robert chandross chief economist with lloyds bank plc in new 
york called the survey figures unambiguously weak with 
employment particularly hardhit 
thirtythree percent of the purchasing managers questioned said 
employment was down at their companies while 62 percent said it 
was the same and 5 percent said hiring was up 
in october 28 percent said employment was down 63 percent said 
it was the same and 9 percent said it was higher 
the purchasing managers said many companies reported layoffs 
hiring freezes plant closings and other steps to bring staffing 
levels in line with business activity 
employment s tied directly to production and new orders both 
of which declined 
fortythree percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said 
their firms had fewer new orders in november while 39 percent said 
orders were the same and only 18 percent said they had more orders 
it was the fifth consecutive monthly decline for new orders 
dropping them to to their lowest point since may 1982 in october 
34 percent reported fewer orders 47 percent were the same and 19 
percent were up 
robert bretz chairman of the trade group said the decline in 
orders was an ominous sign for the economy 
it appears likely the negative trend will continue for some 
time bretz said in a statement 
production levels fell for the fourth straight month in 
november thirtyfive percent of those surveyed said production at 
their firms was down 49 percent said it was the same and 16 
percent said it was up 
in october 31 percent reported lower production 52 percent 
said it was the same and 17 percent said it was up 
the survey also found that deliveries to the companies from 
suppliers were faster than the previous month this is yet another 
negative economic signal because it means companies have fewer 
orders to fill and therefore can deliver their goods faster 
inflation accelerated by the surge in oil prices since the 
middle east crisis began in august continued to put a bite on 
industrial firms most reported they were again paying higher 
prices for raw materials although the rate of increase was down 
from september and october 
chandross said the economy would begin to turn around if the 
federal reserve eases credit 
the weaker the economy looks the more aggressively the 
federal reserve will have to lower interest rates to stimulate 
business activity he said 
both he and levinson said however that the middle east crisis 
which has sent oil prices sharply higher stands in the way of an 
economic recovery 
hopefully in the early part of next year some kind of 
resolution to the persian gulf crisis will allow business and 
individuals to go forward with a little more certainty levinson 
said 
the national association of purchasing management is a trade 
group of purchasing executives at industrial companies across the 
country its monthly survey questions purchasing managers at 300 
firms

stock prices posted modest gains monday as oil 
prices appeared to stabilize at lower levels and interest rates 
slipped 
but more evidence of a weakening economy and a decline in 
american telephone amp telegraph stock in the wake of its 6 billion 
stock offer for ncr corp limited the gains 
the dow jones industrial average which rose 4084 points on 
friday added another 594 points to close at 256559 it had been 
up by about 16 points near the opening but quickly gave up most of 
those gains

nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 21146 million shares 
analysts said the market opened strongly in the wake of gains on 
overseas markets and a strong performance in the bond futures 
market overnight 
there was continuing hope that the bush administrations offer 
to discuss the middle east crisis with iraqi president saddam 
hussein might avert a war 
that development had sparked a big drop in oil prices on friday 
and prices recovered only a fraction of that ground on monday 
the january contract for light sweet crude oil which lost 
406 a barrel on friday edged up 30 cents monday to settle at 
2915 a barrel 
bond prices meanwhile advanced and pushed yields on 30year 
bonds down toward 835 percent from 839 percent at the end of last 
week 
tempering the stock markets advance were signs of more economic 
weakness 
the national association of purchasing management said its 
purchasing managers index a closelyfollowed economic indicator 
tumbled to 413 percent in november from 434 percent in october in 
another sign of weakening in manufacturing and the overall economy 
people are realizing the main factor in the stock market is 
the economy and these figures are still painting a dismal picture 
of the economy said newton zinder a veteran market watcher at 
shearson lehman bros 
the government reported construction spending increased 13 
percent in october but much of that was due to new school and 
sewer projects spending on residential and nonresidential 
buildings continued to fall 
the rise in the dow jones average was constrained by atampt which 
fell 2 to 30lsqb after offering to acquire ncr in a 6 billion stock

businesses facing lawsuits over pensions 
received some protection from the supreme court monday as the 
justices ruled workers cannot sue in state courts on grounds they 
were fired so their employers would not have to pay pension 
benefits 
the court ruled unanimously that state suits are preempted by 
the employee retirement income security act of 1974 which is aimed 
at assuring that workers get their retirement pay 
state lawsuits had loomed as potentially far more lucrative 
because fired employees could win punitive damages that greatly 
exceed lost pay 
in other cases affecting businesses the supreme court on 
monday 
left intact an iowa supreme court ruling that forced four 
omaha neb automobile dealerships to defend themselves in iowa 
courts in lawsuits brought under that states consumer fraud laws 
the dealerships had argued that iowas courts have no authority 
over them 
ruled that a federal anticounterfeiting law may be used to 
crack down on the sale of used cars with phony mileage readings 
writing in the pension case justice sandra day oconnor said 
congress clearly intended to preclude state lawsuits over firings 
motivated by efforts to avoid paying pension benefits 
the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial 
burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or 
between states and the federal government oconnor said 
the decision is a victory for the ingersollrand co which was 
sued by perry mcclendon after it fired him in 1982 
mcclendon had been transferred by the company from san antonio 
to dallas in 1979 to develop a sales market for construction 
equipment there he was fired four months before his 10th 
anniversary with the company 
a worker with 10 years experience is entitled to have his 
pension vested which meant ingersollrand would have to contribute 
to mcclendons retirement benefits 
mcclendon sued in texas state courts accusing his former 
employer of firing him to avoid paying pension benefits the 
company said he was fired to reduce the workforce and save money 
mcclendon did not sue for lost pension benefits in fact 
shortly after he sued the company agreed to vest his pension 
instead mcclendons suit sought a potentially bigmoney judgment 
for lost wages mental anguish and punitive damages

the government said monday it hopes to 
halve state ownership of businesses in the next few years as it 
replaces the marxist economic model of past communist rulers with 
one where private ownership dominates 
we may succeed in reducing the share of state ownership to 50 
percent or less in the coming three to four years government 
official lajos csepi told reporters 
csepi is managing director of the state property agency set up 
in march as hungary prepared for the first democratic elections in 
four decades to oversee the sale of stateowned assets 
he spoke on the eve of a scheduled national address by premier 
jozsef antall expected to deal primarily with the dismal state of 
the economy the 1991 budget to be presented in parliament next 
week envisages a deficit of 78 billion forints or 13 billion 
as in other east european countries liberated from communist 
domination this year initial euphoria among the population has 
been replaced by gloom over the economic picture as the nation 
struggles to correct past mistakes 
inflation is at 35 percent the foreign debt has reached 20 
billion the highest per capita among former soviet bloc nations 
unemployment officially unknown under the communist leadership is 
now at 70000 and is expected to balloon to 200000 of the 45 
million work force by next year poverty is growing 
the state mti news agency cited statistics indicating that at 
least 60 percent of families are drawing on savings just to make 
ends meet compared to 40 percent last year 
growing frustration peaked late last month in a threeday 
national blockade of main streets and highways by truckers and 
cabbies irate over a planned 65percent gasoline price hike 
most of the population supported the unprecedented protest 
forcing antalls conservative government coalition to back down and 
agree to lesser price increases 
the decision to increase gasoline prices was due in part to 
shortfalls in promised soviet oil deliveries and to the rising 
price of crude on the world market because of the gulf crisis 
janos martonyi state secretary of the ministry of international 
economic relations recently estimated economic damage from the 
gulf crisis at 200 million including the cancellation of trade 
with iraq under terms of a un embargo 
worsening economic conditions have taken their toll on 
government popularity with hungarians increasingly agreeing with 
opposition charges that the return to a capitalist economy is being 
mismanaged and is taking too long 
the criticism has exacerbated internal government differences 
finance minister ferenc rabar announced oct 10 that he planned to 
resign after passage of the budget following months of dispute 
with gyoergy matolcsi state secretary of the prime ministers 
office and a key economic aide over responsibility for longterm 
economic plans

soybean futures prices bounded to fiveweek highs monday on the 
chicago board of trade in a late rally fueled by signs of tight 
supplies and prospects for stronger export demand most grain 
futures also advanced 
on other commodity markets most energy futures fell sharply 
gold futures retreated while silver advanced cattle futures were 
mixed and pork futures were lower 
soybean futures settled 4 cents to 11 cents higher in chicago 
with the contract for delivery in january at 601 a bushel the 
first daily close above 6 for a nearterm contract since oct 25 
wheat finished 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 
247 a bushel corn was cent lower to 2 cents higher with 
december at 230 a bushel oats were cent lower to 1 cents 
higher with december at 113 a bushel 
the surge began in the soybean oil pit after a large number of 
oil delivery notices were cancelled indicating soybean oil 
supplies for delivery against the december contract may be tighter 
than previously thought according to analysts 
steve freed grains analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago said the soybean complex also was boosted by reports that 
germany is considering selling at least some of its excess soybean 
crushing capacity to the soviet union 
he said such an increase in european crushing activity probably 
would result in stronger demand for us soybeans since the 
europeans must import all the beans they use 
we know brazil is basically out and the argentinians are 
running out so the only store left in town would be the united 
states freed said 
william biedermann research director for the commodities 
brokerage allendale inc said us farmers have been reluctant to 
sell their soybeans at the recent low prices which bottomed out at 
552 a bushel on nov 14 the limited availability of newcrop 
beans has contributed to the rise in prices he said 
biedermann said tax considerations will prevent many farmers 
from selling newcrop commodities until the new year leading to 
further supply tightness 
you can figure that from now until the end of the year the bin 
door is locked up he said 
nearterm crude oil rose slightly but other petroleum futures 
fell sharply on the new york mercantile exchange reflecting lower 
fears of war in the persian gulf the decline extended the steep 
losses that were posted friday in reaction to president bushs new 
push for a negotiated settlement in the usiraqi standoff over 
iraqs occupation of kuwait 
the story supporting a negotiated solution is still fresh in 
everybodys mind said ray mazzeo energy futures specialist with 
shearson lehman brothers inc 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 197 lower to 30 cents 
higher with january at 2915 a barrel heating oil was 229 cents 
to 389 cents lower with january at 8467 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 31 cents to 54 cents lower with january at 7352 
cents a gallon natural gas was 01 cent to 35 cents higher with 
january at 2475 per 1000 cubic feet 
gold futures fell sharply on new yorks commodity exchange in 
line with the drop in energy prices and a stronger dollar silver 
edged higher 
gold settled 670 to 770 lower with december at 37660 a 
troy ounce silver was 1 cent to 16 cents higher with december at 
4138 a troy ounce 
cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago board of 
trade pork futures retreated amid profittaking after rallying 
early in the session on perceptions that hog marketings in the 
midwest would be slowed by wintry weather 
live cattle finished 20 cent lower to 30 cent higher with 
december at 7870 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent lower 
to 10 cent higher with january at 8760 a pound live hogs were

the g7 nations the united states britain france germany 
japan italy and canada have said little as the dollar plunged in

boston said the persian gulf crisis continued to affect dollar 
trading with rumors alternately sparking buying and selling the

international strife

volatile and confusing

fundamental economic factors rather than by a weak dollar

for three years the tobacco industry and its congressional 
allies have lobbied the environmental protection agency to soften 
or delay its three draft reports on secondhand cigarette smoke 
documents show 
industry representatives sent the epa a mountain of technical 
information that dwarfs the epas reports and met repeatedly with 
agency officials to press their concerns according to documents 
obtained by the associated press under the freedom of information 
act 
they clearly were privy to stuff that was going on that we had 
no idea about said mark pertschuk executive director of 
americans for nonsmokers rights in berkeley calif 
the epa at the industrys request twice extended the time 
allowed for outside comment on draft reports 
no one else was as active in conveying their concerns and 
interests said robert axelrad director of the epas indoor air 
division he said the agency received boxloads of material from 
the industry 
the next step in the preparation of the reports occurs tuesday 
and wednesday in washington an advisory panel chosen by the agency 
will meet to consider the reports and hear testimony from 
interested parties including a dozen tobacco industry 
representatives 
two of the three reports will be considered a report assessing 
the lung cancer risks associated with passive smoking and a 
workplace policy guide on environmental tobacco smoke 
the risk assessment recommends that environmental tobacco smoke 
be declared a class a carcinogen a known cause of human cancer 
a third epa report a compendium of related technical 
information on passive smoking is undergoing revision 
two republicans from the tobacco state of virginia us rep 
thomas bliley and sen john warner have written to the epa 
expressing concerns shared by the industry bliley has repeatedly 
sought clarification of epa procedures and protested the agencys 
reliance on certain scientists whose work has found large risks 
associated with passive smoking 
brennan dawson a spokeswoman for the tobacco institute said 
passive smoking is important to the industry and weve let the 
epa know 
what we have tried to do is stay in the process and do it 
appropriately and through conversations with epa staff she said 
there has been a lot of involvement by the antismoking 
community that we dont think should be there if youre going to 
pursue science it ought to be without advocacy 
the outcome certainly has not been entirely to our 
satisfaction 
most of the epas correspondence with industry representatives 
makes clear the industrys comments are welcome in a june 30 
1989 letter however an assistant administrator of the epa 
criticized the industry for its continued refusal to admit that 
smoking causes cancer and other diseases in smokers 
the industrys argument that passive smoking is not a proven 
danger would be more credible if it were not so similar to the 
tobacco industrys position on direct smoking despite the 
estimated 50000 studies linking smoking with disease in humans 
wrote william rosenberg the epas assistant administrator for air 
and radiation 
the industry has been lobbying outside the epa too the tobacco 
institute and the two largest tobacco companies philip morris and 
rj reynolds have formed a media subcommittee to get their 
message to the media 
three rj reynolds scientists a company spokeswoman and an 
adviser from pr firm hill and knowlton have been on the road nearly 
fulltime since labor day talking to reporters and newspaper 
editorial boards about the epa reports said betsy annese of rj 
reynolds 
antismoking groups were critical of the apparent access granted 
the tobacco companies by the epa 
they basically have no business being in there at all said 
richard daynard an attorney and the chairman of the tobacco 
products liability group in boston nobodys talking in these 
proceedings about regulating the tobacco industry theyre talking 
about regulating individual behavior 
as i look at the intense pressure that the tobacco industry 
placed on epa staff i see that they had a tremendous amount of 
information about the process said pertschuk

securities and exchange commission 
in new york where avon is based avon spokesman john cox said

proposals that have been placed on the table during the last few 
months he said 
a special committee of the board of directors is studying all 
of these proposals with its independent adviser james d 
wolfensohn amp co which will present its recommendations to the

donald trumps taj mahal casino 
resort got off to a shaky start but a proposed restructuring of 
675 million in debt will give it time to recover casino officials 
testified monday 
the anticipation and expectation was perhaps way too high 
knowing what we know today said ed tracy president of trumps 
atlantic city holdings 
he and trump organization chief financial officer stephen 
bollenbach blamed the casinos problems on the recession in the 
northeast and on its failure to capture enough of the lucrative 
slot machine market 
but both said conservative projections for the coming year leave 
the property poised to recover 
when times get good again well have a wonderful property 
bollenbach told the state casino control commission during a 
special hearing into the taj mahals financial stability 
trump did not attend the hearing but his associates said they 
expected to finish details of the restructuring within a week and 
file it with the securities and exchange commission dec 17 
the casino commission said it would hold hearings dec 12aand 
dec 19 as details of the restructuring plan are finalized 
a ruling would come after dec 19 said chairman steve perskie 
under state law the commission is responsible for ensuring that 
each casino licensee remains financially stable and has the power 
to revoke a license 
one day after missing a 473 million bond payment due investors 
in the taj mahal trump reached a restructuring deal on nov 16 
that reduces the interest rate on the notes from 14 percent to 12 
percent 
the agreement also spreads the repayment date over 10 years to 
the year 2000 instead of 1998 and gives bondholders half ownership 
in the taj mahal 
trump can recover up to 30 percent of the ownership if he can 
repay the bonds at rates above 12 percent 
the casino plans to enter into a prepackaged bankruptcy 
agreed to by bondholders and emerge by the spring bollenbach said 
state gaming regulators however said the plan fails to cut the 
taj mahals debt significantly they said it was still too early to 
assess the deals prospects 
regrettably future stability cannot be adequately judged now 
but must await an assessment of the final resolution between the 
taj mahal and its bondholders said deputy attorney general 
thomas auriemma 
nevertheless to the extent that the crisis which has 
developed has forced this company to rethink its entire capital 
structure there may be longterm positive benefits for this 
licensee he said 
trump executives continued to play up the agreement 
the really important element is that it reduces the 
interest rate bollenbach said a 12 percent rate would be a 
very competitive rate 
another key aspect of the deal would allow the casino to borrow 
up to 50 million to meet debt service with bondholders agreeing 
to relinquish their claim to the new lender he said that means 
the new lender would have first claim if any action is taken 
against the taj mahal 
tracy and bollenbach noted the taj mahal has cut operating 
costs with a 29 percent cut in payroll

former vernon savings association owner don r 
dixon on trial for bank fraud testified monday that he told 
executives of the thrift to check with attorneys before reimbursing 
themselves for political contributions 
dixon spent all day in the witness chair his second day of 
testimony prosecutors and defense attorney billy ravkind said 
dixon would finish testifying tuesday and the jury is expected to 
get the case on wednesday 
some of the 38 bank fraud and conspiracy charges against dixon 
accuse him of making illegal political donations with vernon funds 
former vernon officers have testified that dixon encouraged them to 
donate money to certain candidates and reimburse themselves through 
falsified company expense accounts 
dixon responding to ravkind said he encouraged political 
donations to try to maintain the environment we were prospering 
in but he said some officers complained the donations were a 
hardship 
if its that hard on you you can expense it on our expense 
account if you can clear it with our attorneys dixon said he 
told one vernon official he said he didnt authorize any vernon 
officer to cheat on expense accounts 
he is also accused of using vernon funds personally for 
prostitutes trips and beach houses in california 
if convicted on all counts dixon could be sentenced to up to 
190 years in prison and be fined as much as 95 million 
during crossexamination prosecutors focused on an agreement 
between dixon and developer jim atkinson who paid for a beach 
house near san diego that vernon and dixon used 
dixon testified he and atkinson a vernon borrower had agreed 
on a handshake that atkinson could use the house half the time 
and receive a share of the proceeds of its sale in return for 
paying its lease 
he said there were no written documents of the agreement for 
thrift regulators to inspect 
under ravkinds questioning dixon said vernon needed the 1 
million house to boost its image while moving into the southern 
california real estate market 
for a little savings and loan from vernon texas to go to the 
shores of southern california and attract any type of quality 
builderinvestors we felt we had to be part of the community 
dixon said 
he said the house was remodeled to include three master bedrooms 
and three smaller bedrooms so that it could be used by the thrifts 
executives while visiting their california operations 
he said the thrift had planned to sell the beach house after 
establishing a permanent office in the san diego area which he 
originally thought would take three years 
vernon was still making payments on the house in 1986 previous 
witnesses have said the thrift opened an office in san diego in 
1983 but it did not have facilities for executives such as a 
conference room dixon said 
dixon also provided details of trips to kansas and california he 
took with linton bowman former commissioner of the texas savings 
and loan department the trips were paid for by vernon he 
testified their expense was not harmful to the savings and loan 
the california trips were made dixon said so bowman would 
get comfortable with the rapid growth of vernon in southern 
california dixon also wanted bowman to check out some car 
dealership investments he was considering and a computer system 
developed by a southern california thrift consultant 
dixon said he helped arrange for a female vernon employee to be 
a date for bowman on one those trips providing a date was 
probably inappropriate but at the time i did not think so 
dixon testified 
he said it was not a regular business practice for vernon to 
provide escorts at social functions and said the thrift never paid 
women for sex 
dixon said he had no recollection of anything offcolor ever 
occurring during parties the thrift hosted as other witnesses have 
testified 
dixon testified he became concerned about vernons financial 
condition in the mid1980s when he heard rumors congress might 
change tax laws and thrift regulators might step up their efforts 
dixon said regulators lawmakers and thrift leaders including 
himself should all be faulted for the savings and loan crisis 
we should all share in the blame he said 
vernon failed in 1987 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of more 
than 12 billion dixon who developed condominiums before 
purchasing vernon in 1981 increased the thrifts assets tenfold 
through speculative real estate and construction deals

texas oilman t boone pickens and building 
trade unions from ohio and kentucky said monday they are starting a 
research organization to investigate foreign investment in a 
sixstate region 
jerry hammond executive secretarytreasurer of the kentucky 
state building amp construction trades council said the study will 
focus first on japanese investment in the regions auto industry 
because of the investments by toyota nissan mazda mitsubishi 
honda and subaruisuzu 
he said the study is likely to expand to japanese investment in 
the steel business australian regional investments and italian 
contractors 
pickens has become a leading critic of japans business 
practices because of his frustrated attempts to get a board seat on 
a japanese company hes invested in 
he said the japanese who are among the biggest foreign 
investors in this country are unfairly preventing american entry 
into japanese corporate management 
he attended a luncheon to give a 5000 check for the 
midamerica project 
the building trade councils of cincinnati and central kentucky 
are joining in the project jerry monahan executive secretary of 
the cincinnati council estimated the unions would provide about 
25000 in financing 
pickens said he is confident the study will find evidence that 
japanese keiretsus cartellike organizations of interlocking 
companies are operating in the united states to the detriment of 
outside competitors 
pickens noted that the federal trade commission at the urging 
of congress is investigating to determine whether japan is 
exporting its corporate cartels in violation of us antitrust 
laws 
theres no doubt in my mind that the midamerica project is 
going to find that the keiretsu system is being exported to the 
us and is more damaging than anyone ever figured pickens said 
union leaders said they want to compile a computerized 
information database of foreign investment in illinois indiana 
ohio michigan kentucky and tennessee they expect the first data 
by late spring and will use it to assess job prospects and 
employment practices and to better understand the objectives of 
foreign investors 
hammond said the unions intend to be fair to the japanese in the 
study they will gather information from published studies and 
public information including corporate filings and courthouse 
records 
we see new neighbors we dont know we hear languages we dont 
understand hammond told the union members we dont fear 
change change and ignorance is a dangerous combination 
union leaders said they contacted pickens to initiate the 
research project because they support pickens drive for american 
access to japanese markets equal to what japanese companies are 
granted in the united states 
pickens founder of dallasbased mesa petroleum says the 
management of japans koito manufacturing co supplier of lighting 
systems for toyota vehicles has denied him seats on the companys 
board and access to its financial documents even though pickens 
boone co investment firm owns 26 percent of koito 
all i want is a chance american shareholders must have the 
same investment rights in japan that japanese investors have in the 
united states pickens said 
he said 850 of 900 us companies with japanese investors have 
japanese board members 
nori shikata press attache at the japanese embassy in 
washington responded we are not sure how applicable his own 
specific case is to when he describes the total japanese 
environment 
shikata said the cincinnatibased procter amp gamble co is among 
us companies that have penetrated the japanese market 
the people who are not successful tend to complain shikata 
said 
koito manufacturing co said through a press statement that 
pickens has been harassing koito in a greenmail raid 
pickens has cynically poisoned japaneseamerican trade 
relations in an effort to advance his own personal financial 
interests koito said

more than 2000 dockworkers in and around philadelphia and in 
baltimore stayed off the job monday as strikes prevented ships from 
loading or unloading during the ports busiest season 
were not going to handle anything without a contract said 
dan duffy a longshoreman in philadelphia where a strike entered 
its third day 
the walkout involves eight locals of the international 
longshoremens association representing about 2000 dockworkers at 
delaware river ports in philadelphia southern new jersey and 
wilmington del 
the workers went on strike saturday after rejecting an offer for 
a new contract by the philadelphia marine trade association an 
employers group 
in baltimore business at the waterfront was at a 
nearstandstill after 415 cargo clerks began a walkout monday after 
contract talks collapsed over pension and benefit fund 
contributions 
without cargo clerks to process documents most ships were not 
being loaded or unloaded in baltimore 
the strikes coincide with the ports busiest season when 
imported fruit keeps the docks bustling 
the philadelphiaarea ports are to receive 22 ships by 
wednesday said susan howland a spokeswoman for the philadelphia 
maritime exchange she said five ships already have been diverted 
to posts in massachusetts connecticut and virginia 
negotiators for the workers and the philadelphiaarea ports met 
monday and were to resume talks tuesday the union struck after the 
dockworkers 14month contract extension expired at midnight 
friday 
the union and the employers could not agree on the terms of a 
new threeyear 10month contract union and port officials said 
the stumbling blocks included work rules and employer contributions 
to welfare and benefit funds 
the strike by local 953 of the ila in baltimore was surprising 
because a tentative agreement was reached friday with locals 
representing most of the port of baltimores 2000 union members 
it was not clear whether other locals would honor the cargo 
clerks walkout 
baltimore officials had hoped to get some cargo diverted from 
philadelphia because of the strike there richard trainor chairman 
of the maryland port commission said the port generates 76 
million in business a day and can expect to lose 25 million each 
day of the strike

of the companys chemical plants but a union criticized the offer 
as a publicity stunt

ailments whos going to hire us said john littlejohn vice 
president of chemical workers local 417 were too old for 
school 
littlejohn said the locals members want the 400000 divided 
among the 96 workers who lost their jobs after the july 19 
explosion basf said it would pay for tuition at vocational 
schools books and living expenses 
the blast blamed on explosive fumes from a cleaning solvent 
destroyed much of the plant which made chemicals to coat paper 
cups and food cans the explosion killed two people and injured 
about 80 others 
the federal occupational safety and health administration fined 
the company 16 million in november citing more than 100 safety 
violations at the plant 
while our actions can in no way make up for the hardships 
caused by the accident we have tried to do as much as we can and 
we will continue to do so said j larry jameson president of 
basfs coatings and colorings division 
a threemember panel including an administrator from the 
university of cincinnati is to supervise a trust fund to pay for

publisher james hoge said monday he is 
determined to lure advertisers and readers back to the 
strikehampered daily news and expects the tabloid to survive and 
thrive 
absolutely no question about it hoge said in an interview 
we will prevail we hope through settlement but if not without 
it 
the man at the center of the 5weekold strike by 2100 
unionized employees said he is exploring options to take the paper 
in new directions once the work force is stabilized 
before new plans can be carried out he said the strike must 
end profits must begin and the work abuses the news has alleged 
must be eliminated 
as he sat in his eighthfloor office in midtown manhattan hoge 
spoke as if addressing the picketers on the sidewalk below 
fellows get rid of the inefficiencies with us so we can build a 
secure future for the next century 
the news recently spent 3 million to 4 million to select new 
technology and design new printing plants to be built on land 
bought in new jersey and long island before the strike the 
publisher said 
he said expansion options being weighed include creating either 
an afternoon edition a satelliteproduced national edition or a 
school edition at least one was discussed at a monday morning 
meeting he said but he gave no further details 
i wouldnt want to put a time on it now hoge said we 
have been chomping at the bit to be innovative and try to do things 
when we think its practical to do so and that includes variations 
on what we do today 
the strike by nine unions which began oct 25 has cost the 
paper untold millions of dollars it has been marked by incidents 
of vandalism against news trucks and against news dealers who carry 
the paper 
the unions say the news engaged in unfair labor practices which 
the paper denies and the news parent the tribune co of chicago 
is trying to break the unions a charge hoge denied monday 
major advertisers have deserted the pages of what was before 
the strike the nations thirdlargest metropolitan daily and have 
fattened the pages of its tabloid rivals 
hoge estimated the papers losses would total 200 million from 
1979 to the end of this year but he would not specify how much the 
strike is costing the news vice president for human resources 
john t sloan has said the paper expects to lose 30 million to 
35 million in this quarter 
the paper has published every day during the strike using 
management replacement workers and employees who crossed the 
picket line but circulation which was 109 million on weekdays 
before the strike has dropped drastically 
the news filed a civil racketeering suit against the striking 
unions last week claiming a pattern of orchestrated violence had 
blocked the papers distribution 
the paper has used a system of hawkers numbering more than 
1000 to help sell the paper 
under an agreement reached with the metropolitan transportation 
authority and enforced by court order hawkers appeared monday on 
subway platforms and at commuter rail stations transit police said 
there were no violent incidents 
hoge said the hawkers each day are given their 200000 papers 
free and are making 100 percent profit that helps bring current 
circulation to 525000 hoge said 
here it is a question of building back arduously piece by 
piece the distribution system and we are doing it hoge said 
we went from about 400 sales outlets in the first 72 hours after 
the strike to well over 4000 now we added over 900 last week 
well add more this week 
hoge said he wants to get all parties to the negotiating table 
and is willing to offer job buyouts if the unions are interested 
however he reiterated the news demand for an end to what it sees 
as featherbedding and other labor abuses 
i do not regret at all that we have in this generation faced 
up to the issue that you have got to reform the contracts 
because if we did not the paper could not survive hoge said
