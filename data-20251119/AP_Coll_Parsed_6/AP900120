charge who eluded police for 18 months taunting them with 
telephone calls and a note reading nya nya nya

rogness commander of the los angeles police departments narcotics 
unit in the san fernando valley

leaving her sons hollywood apartment police said friday 
police learned of her whereabouts from a news story last month 
saying she was president of her sons rock group fan club rogness 
said 
ulrichs case started june 19 1987 when officers searched an 
apartment and found cocaine valued at 85000 police issued a

she addressed the police as dingbats and said i want to 
continue to make a fool of you ill be a folk hero and youll look 
like the moron you are

the calls poured into newspapers radio and 
television stations young men suddenly were being summoned for 
active service and their wives and mothers demanded to know why 
then they gathered on town squares and demanded that the callup 
stop 
i wont give up my son a woman shouted furiously at a 
public protest in the southern russian city of stavropol where 
president mikhail s gorbachev was communist party chief for many 
years 
we put up with everything we put up with it we put up with 
it how long are we going to put up with everything she asked in 
a report that was shown on the nationwide television news program 
vremya 
at a stavropol assembly hall another woman shown on vremya 
proclaimed that her factory objected to the callup we dont 
want the peoples of these republics to call us occupants we dont 
want another afghanistan she said 
such powerful reaction to thursdays callup of reservists in 
southern russia to help impose order in ethnic strife in the 
caucasus showed just how public sentiment toward military service 
had changed in the postafghanistan era 
the protests appeared to get results gorbachev acknowledged the 
population in the southern russia areas where the callup went out 
were unhappy and staterun media reported friday that all the 
reservists would be home by wednesday replaced by career soldiers 
in an almost apologetic tone the soviet forces chief political 
officer ad lizichev told tass that the reserve callup was a 
forced but unavoidable measure 
after all were talking about the fate of peoples about 
bringing order in our soviet home he said 
such arguments seemed to have little effect however on the 
residents of stavropol 
one speaker at the stavropol protest urged the several hundred 
people to come back saturday to approve an official document 
calling for the callup to end and all the reservists to be sent 
home 
a woman in a shiny fur hat complained to the cameras the 
situation is getting worse and today when my son is called up i 
categorically object to my sons blood being spilled what for 
because the government isnt taking radical measures 
during the nine years of the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
there were virtually no antiwar protests except a few small pickets 
by brave mothers 
but since the last soviet soldiers pulled out in february the 
government has said the intervention was a mistake and it has 
become acceptable to condemn the soviet involvement in afghanistan 
as an illconceived foreign adventure 
the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported friday it had 
been swamped with calls from the families of reservists 
theyve taken my husband to war groaned a young woman from 
kislovodsk into the phone the newspaper said and then 
followed calls from pyatigorsk yessentukov proletarsk in the 
rostov region all cities in the russian area near the caucasus

first the good stuff about oat bran was debunked 
in a prestigious medical journal 
now rice is taking its lumps 
and the rice industry footed the bill 
a university of texas health science center researcher has just 
finished a 162000 study paid for by rice industry backers and 
the researcher says if rice bran has any cholesterollowering 
benefits he hasnt found them 
instead he advised people trying to lower cholesterol levels to 
reduce fat intake get to a normal weight and exercise 
the rice industry which has disassociated itself from the 
study says the report by nutritionist jim hickson and partner mark 
clasen is inconclusive 
rice council of america spokesman kris obrien said three other 
studies have shown rice bran does have a positive effect on 
cholesterol 
referring to hicksons study obrien said we dont think 
its proper to say that since his test didnt show anything the 
other three studies are wiped out 
hickson said the companies were not happy they were very 
unhappy when you come up empty its like you failed 
in the study about 64 volunteers spent 15 weeks eating foods 
prepared by the university health center 
in the first 10 weeks the diet included 50 grams of rice bran 
daily most of it concealed in bread researchers monitored 
cholesterol levels 
we knew by week 6 or 7 nothing was happening hickson said 
at week 10 the rice bran intake was increased to 100 grams a 
day 
hickson said he questioned whether 100 grams of rice bran a day 
about two cups was a realistic amount to consume

cabinet he formed it two days after japan surrendered to the 
allies on august 15 1945 at the request of the late emperor

the navy flew a tomahawk cruise missile over 
maine on friday in the first such flight since the states voters 
rejected missile tests over their soil in a referendum in november 
the unarmed missile went on a 700mile roundabout flight from 
the destroyer uss conolly to a recovery site at a navy survival 
school outside rangeley in western maine the test was extremely 
successful said bob holsapple spokesman for the navy cruise 
missile project 
in portland organizers of the referendum to halt the tests were 
outraged and planned demonstrations next week 
the test flight which began at noon and lasted approximately 90 
minutes followed a meandering path across the center of the state 
primarily above forest and mountains the test had been delayed 
earlier in the week because of bad weather 
temperatures at flight levels were around zero allowing the 
navy to carry out its mission of testing the tomahawks performance 
in cold weather holsapple said 
before parachuting to the ground at the recovery site the 
missile circled the town of rangeley at an altitude of about 3500 
feet the navy spokesman said 
eric johnson spokesman for the coalition for the cruise missile 
referendum said he was incensed that the navys defied maine 
voters who approved the nonbinding referendum against missile 
tests by 52 percent to 48 percent 
the test is particularly inappropriate when the easing of cold 
war tensions has reduced the need expensive weapon systems he 
said maintaining that cruise missiles pose the greatest single 
obstacle to a strategic arms treaty 
earlier this month navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii 
notified the maine congressional delegation that three test flights 
were planned this year despite the referendum

senate republican leader bob dole predicts a 
democratic proposal to roll back social security payroll tax hikes 
will selfdestruct in congress 
dole told reporters friday the move by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny to slash the taxes must be reconciled with 
another democrats push for enactment of a national sales tax and 
predicted that couldnt happen 
the kansas republican linked the social security proposal to 
legislation to be submitted by sen ernest hollings dsc 
seeking a 5 percent value added tax 
hell deliver the good news of a tax cut he said of 
moynihan and hollings will deliver the bad news because of 
this dole said the social security initiative will 
selfdestruct 
not only that dole said the white house will soon offer a 
proposal that would force the government to stop using the social 
security surpluses to reduce the budget deficit 
dole commented as rep john porter rill introduced his own 
proposal for preventing use of surplus social security taxes to 
reduce the federal deficit 
porter said that unlike moynihans proposal his would protect 
retirees without playing taxcut politics with the social 
security system 
meantime senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
that moynihans proposal dramatizes the inequity and regressive 
nature of the tax system but he wasnt ready to endorse it 
mitchell said hes worried about the impact of moynihans 
proposal on the multibilliondollar budget deficit and said he 
would await two staff studies before making up his mind 
but he criticized president bush for immediately resisting 
moynihans proposal saying i regret the manner in which the 
president and the white house has treated t 
discussing issues facing lawmakers when the second session of 
the 101st congress resumes next week mitchell used the social 
security payroll tax issue to attack bushs tax policies 
particularly his quest for a cut in capital gains taxes 
the maine democrat said moynihan stated in very stark terms 
the administrations tax policy which is lets cut taxes for the 
wealthy but not the working people let the little people pay 
cut taxes for the very wealthy 
i think that is a tax policy that is unfair and wrong from a 
policy standpoint and senator moynihan has expressed it 
dramatically he said 
moynihan wants to roll back the social security payroll tax 
increase that began jan 1 his proposal would save workers 7 
billion in social security taxes this year and 55 billion in 
fiscal 1991 
the payroll tax paid by both employers and employees rose to 
765 percent jan 1 from 751 percent and it is levied on wages up 
to 51300 instead of 48000 a wageearner could pay as much as 
3924 in social security taxes this year an increase of about 
319 from 1989 
porters plan which is being promoted by house republican whip 
newt gingrich of georgia would return the surplus proportionately 
to workers the money would not come in tax cuts or refunds but 
into a kind of individual retirement account and each workers 
claim on future social security benefits would drop as the 
individual account builds

in a show of support for an emerging 
democracy secretary of state james a baker iii will visit 
czechoslovakia next month after he holds talks in moscow on easing 
eastwest tensions 
us officials say baker may add other eastern and central 
european stops to his schedule as the bush administration steps up 
its campaign of trying to encourage warsaw pact countries to adopt 
western political and economic systems 
czechoslovakia is making that transition with little indication 
of tension it flirted with reform in 1968 and then experienced two 
decades of hardline rule after the prague spring was 
extinguished by soviet troops and tanks 
baker who is going to moscow on feb 4 for talks with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze also is considering stops 
in romania and bulgaria the us officials said friday 
the bush administration is in the midst of working out a program 
to lower us tariffs so czechoslovakia can boost its trade with 
the united states that would involve a waiver from strictures of 
the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment which imposed high tariffs on 
most communist countries 
baker will discuss with shevardnadze among other topics arms 
control and the 12yearold civil war in afghanistan 
baker will try to resolve with shevardnadze how longrange 
airlaunched cruise missiles carried by bombers should be counted 
against a treaty limit of 6000 strategic nuclear warheads 
the goal is to complete a treaty to reduce us and soviet 
longrange missiles by 30 to 50 percent in time for it to be signed 
by president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at 
their washington summit meeting in june 
robert kimmitt undersecretary of state for political affairs 
met with afghan rebel leaders thursday in pakistan to help set the 
stage for bakers meeting with shevardnadze 
the soviets withdrew their troops from afghanistan last year 
but the promoscow government has managed to hold its own against 
usarmed rebels 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
baker discusses peace prospects for afghanistan every time he sees 
shevardnadze 
baker likely will go to prague on feb 8 or 9 depending on 
other undecided travel plans said the officials who demanded 
anonymity he will wind up in ottawa for the feb 1213 conference 
with nato and warsaw pact foreign ministers on the us open 
skies proposal 
that proposal would allow unarmed aircraft to fly over other 
countries territories in search of suspected military activity 
czechoslovakia at one time a hardline communist state is led 
by president vaclav havel and speaker of the parliament alexander 
dubcek 
havel a writer was a target of the old regime for advocating 
human rights dubcek was a leader of the reform movement that took 
power in 1968 and then was crushed by soviet troops and tanks 
the country is moving toward democratic elections havels 
brother ivan a member of civic forum a prodemocracy movement 
and martin palous the groups foreign policy spokesman are due to

meetings around the country to solicit public comment before making 
recommendations 
earlier friday bush told the national association of 
homebuilders in atlanta i am not satisfied with the prevailing 
home mortgage rates of around 10 percent and wants to see lower 
levels throughout the economy 
we cannot allow the high costs of housing to suffocate the 
financial life of americas young people and when it comes to 
housing this must not become a society of haves and have 
nots bush said 
the homebuilders are experiencing a slump with housing starts 
construction of new homes and apartments hitting their lowest 
level last year since the 1982 recession 
the administration over the past few days has been leaning on 
the federal reserve to lower interest rates amid reports that 
momentum for easier credit at the central bank may be ebbing

the pilot of an eastern airlines jet that crashed 
into a smaller plane didnt see it ahead on the runway until the 
last minute because he had been watching another jetliner that 
landed in front of them federal investigators said friday 
a continental airlines jet had been cleared to land on the same 
runway ahead of the twinengine beechcraft air king which was 
struck from behind by the eastern boeing 727200 said robert 
macintosh an investigator with the national transportation safety 
board 
the accident at hartsfield atlanta international airport late 
thursday killed the pilot of the smaller plane and injured the 
copilot there were no other injuries reported 
we were on the ground and we were in stopping mode and 
suddenly there they were said the pilot 23year eastern veteran 
ralph orlando but we couldnt fly anymore we werent at flying 
speed anymore and we had our speed brakes deployed we couldnt 
have possibly lifted over it 
my first instinct was to try to avoid contact so i made a 
sharp left turn to avoid it but that wasnt enough but i also had 
a plane of people to consider said orlando 
the pilot didnt explain why he hadnt seen the small plane 
sooner 
just before the eastern jet overran the beechcraft plane at 
about 710 pm the air traffic controller told the continental 
pilot to stop between runways after he had cleared the airports 
northernmost runway macintosh said at a news conference 
all three planes had been cleared to land on the runway and all 
three pilots were tuned into the same radio frequency with the 
controller he said 
macintosh said the controller told easter pilot orlando that he 
had his plane in sight 
shortly after that transmission the controller asked the 
continental plane to hold short of the parallel runway an 
order macintosh said meant the plane should stop between the two 
runways he said investigators had yet to determine why that order 
was given 
the continental pilot who has yet to be identified did not 
immediately acknowledge the instruction and the tower controllers 
discussed among themselves whether they thought the pilot had heard 
it macintosh said shortly thereafter the eastern pilot reported 
having hit the beechcraft 
the captain of the eastern flight stated he had been looking 
down the runway in some awareness of the continental he saw the 
tail of the beechcraft aircraft a very short time before 
impact macintosh said 
macintosh said investigators do not know why the eastern pilot 
was not aware of the beechcraft until just before the accident he 
said the eastern pilot did not acknowledge hearing the controllers 
instructions clearing the beechcraft for landing 
im certainly not in position to judge error yet he said 
adding it would be absolutely glib for me to opinionize on what 
should have taken place 
macintosh said investigators would spend the weekend examining 
the cockpit recorder tapes and studying the distances between the 
planes the approaches of the plane and the controllers conduct 
earlier friday eastern said its pilot had been cleared to land 
and didnt see the smaller plane until he was right on top of 
him 
another ntsb spokesman drucella andersen said that under 
aircraft approach rules the arriving aircraft cannot be cleared 
to land until the preceding aircraft has left the runway 
we wont speculate as to what this might mean i cant tell 
you what the cause is ms andersen said 
federal aviation administration spokesman jack barker said 
its not unusual for the tower to clear more than one airplane to 
land the pilots must adjust to whatever conditions arise 
the normal landing procedure for a line of planes is to keep a 
distance of three to six miles between each of them in the air 
barker said the rule is designed to give the first plane time to 
land roll out and clear the runway before the next plane crosses 
the runway boundary 
if for some reason the first plane does not clear the runway 
the second plane is supposed to go into a missed approach 
procedure and go around the first plane barker said but eastern 
spokesman jim ashlock said the eastern pilot did not see the first 
plane in time to take evasive action 
he was cleared to land and that tells him my runway is clear 
and i can come on in ashlock said 
the eastern jet rolling down the runway at 120 mph sheared off 
the roof of the twinpropeller plane which was owned by epps air 
service and based at a suburban airport authorities said there 
were no injuries to the eastern planes 141 passengers and crew of 
eight 
airport spokesman john braden said there was a little rain and 
fog at the airport thursday evening but it was not bad weather 
ashlock said he did not know who was at the controls at the time 
of the accident but he said the entire eastern crew had extensive 
flying experience 
orlando had been a pilot for eastern since 1967 he said the 
first officer copilot michael d runyan hired by eastern last 
march had 7388 hours of flying time and second officer henry 
stanford hired by eastern last april had 5430 hours flying 
experience ashlock said 
both planes friday remained on the runway which was closed

soviet troops broke through blockades set up by 
ethnic extremists in downtown baku early saturday and killed at 
least seven people in street battles a spokeswoman for a militant 
azerbaijani group said 
state radio moscow later saturday announced that the presidium 
of the national supreme soviet the governments top executive 
body had declared a state of emergency in baku because of the 
sharp aggravation of the situation that it blamed on criminal 
extremist forces in the city 
the radio confirmed that military units entered baku saying 
they were fired on by militants of the popular front of 
azerbaijan and were forced to retaliate it said casualties had 
been reported but did not give a figure 
the spokeswoman said two pitched battles were fought inside the 
azerbaijani capital leaving at least seven azerbaijanis dead 
its very dangerous on the street she said battles are 
still going on 
the official news agency tass carried no reports of troops 
fighting in baku an oil center and port of 18 million residents 
on the caspian sea western reporters have not been allowed to go 
to the scene since the ethnic violence flared a week ago 
the army intervention the first such combat reported in baku 
involving soviet soldiers came after ethnic riots turned into open 
warfare between azerbaijani and armenian militants bad blood 
between the two peoples goes back centuries 
if the latest deaths are confirmed the toll now would be at 
least 79 people killed and more than 220 wounded 
army and internal security troops poured into the southern 
republics for days but had not entered baku until shortly after 
midnight friday 
leila unusova a spokeswoman for an organization calling itself 
the azerbaijani social democrat group reported by telephone from 
baku that soviet troops surrounded a square near the communist 
party headquarters building where about 30000 azerbaijanis 
gathered in an antigovernment protest 
she said the forces had armored personnel carriers water cannon 
and other military equipment but she did not know if soldiers at 
the square opened fire 
our citizens blockaded roads on the south and north with cars 
and buses she told the associated press young people 20 to 
25 years old were there manning the barricades 
she said that shortly after midnight soviet army units entered 
the city from the north and from a base inside the baku military 
academy and fired on the militants positions 
a doctor told her two young men were killed in one street battle 
and five to seven others died at another site 
wounded were being taken to three city hospitals the 
spokeswoman reported hours after fighting broke out 
about 5000 regular army troops and thousands more interior 
ministry soldiers and police had moved into the troubled areas to 
try to restore order but soviet authorities were reluctant to 
engage the militants directly 
the militarys violent breakup of a nationalist demonstration in 
tbilisi georgia last april in which 19 people were killed 
touched off a national scandal and a defense ministry callup of 
reservists to reinforce military units on thursday was abruptly 
suspended a day later in the face of widespread public protest 
an american journalist in moscow spoke by telephone before dawn 
saturday to a spokesman for the azerbaijani peoples front in baku 
who said soviet soldiers were engaged in street fighting and 
doctors were told to stand by 
the sounds of gunfire could be heard in the background over the 
telephone said the us journalist los angeles times 
correspondent masha hamilton phone connections to the caucasus 
from moscow have been cut much of this week making confirmation of 
reported fighting extremely difficult 
moscow radio said reinforcements were being sent to armenia and 
azerbaijan 
earlier friday president mikhail s gorbachev blamed extremists 
opposed to his reforms for the ethnic warfare in the caucasus and 
said some azerbaijanis were calling for a separate islamic state 
his comments came as azerbaijanis reportedly brought arms into 
the country over the border they have forced open with iran others 
rallied in baku with some calling for the violent overthrow of 
soviet power and a union of the predominantly moslem republic with 
irans azerbaijan region tass said 
many of the troops sent to the southern republics have been 
unable to reach their destinations because hundreds of azerbaijanis 
have blocked airports and roads with trucks and buses opposing 
what they view as kremlin interference 
despite attempts by the troops to maintain order in armenia and 
azerbaijan gorbachev said the situation was not improving 
following six days of battles 
its still difficult peoples lives are in danger 
gorbachev told british tv 
a moscow radio broadcast said friday that additional 
contingents of troops were being brought into armenia and 
azerbaijan and new subunits of interior ministry troops had 
arrived in nagornokarabakh an armeniandominated enclave in 
azerbaijan both armenia and azerbaijan claim the territory 
gorbachev told a conference on his reforms that the warfare 
served the interests of a group of extremists irresponsible 
adventurists and representatives of the shadow economy the 
shadow economy refers to the billions of rubles of illegal trade 
transacted outside the staterun economy 
perestroika is a bone in their throat but they cant oppose 
it directly so they clutch at tension on an ethnic basis 
gorbachev said according to tass 
tass said gorbachev also blamed azerbaijani extremists who are 
calling for the republic to secede from the ussr for an 
islamic azerbaijan but he added among the people they are 
not receiving support 
tass said demonstrators in baku called for secession from the 
soviet union and the unification of soviet azerbaijan with its 
iranian counterpart under the flag of a single islamic state 
people who didnt agree were threatened with violence tass said 
the peoples front newspaper called freedom charged moscow 
with provoking the ethnic warfare the government newspaper 
izvestia said 
other soviet media made baku sound as if it had been virtually 
taken over by the azerbaijani peoples front members have captured 
offices of the kgb the interior ministry and the prosecutor 
destroying documents and trying to seize weapons according to 
interfax a news service of radio moscow 
extremists blockaded the communist party leaderships 
headquarters and demanded the government resign the azerbaijani 
news agency azerinform reported 
baku was paralyzed friday as workers struck to press demands 
that soviet troops be withdrawn from the city and to protest plans 
for a curfew said savili peretz azerinforms deputy director 
most azerbaijanis are shiite moslems and most armenians are 
christians they have been fighting striking and demonstrating 
sporadically for two years in a dispute over nagornokarabakh the 
latest round of violence began jan 13 with antiarmenian riots in 
baku 
the unrest worsened on the iranian border where azerbaijanis 
destroyed guard posts fences and security alarms this month in a 
drive to reunite with their ethnic neighbors 
despite checks by border guards azerbaijanis brought weapons 
across the border from iran izvestia reported friday 
izvestia said extremists commandeered three trains carrying 
soldiers and military equipment in azerbaijan 
tass reported three people were killed and four wounded friday 
in an azerbaijani attack in yeraskh in the armenian republic on the 
border with the azerbaijani enclave of nakhichevan 
it was the first report of azerbaijani attackers crossing into 
armenia

republican national chairman lee atwater says 
the party welcomes candidates on both sides of the divisive 
abortion debate and warns they risk all but certain defeat if they 
try to avoid the issue 
there is no litmus test atwater said friday in his keynote 
address to the republican national committees winter meeting 
which was dominated by discussion of how the gop can blunt the 
democrats successful use of abortion against republicans last year 
atwater said he and president bush would stick to their 
antiabortion positions but said we both understand that a great 
national party is built on many individuals with different views 
our party is big enough to accept different views on many 
different issues atwater said calling the internal debate over 
abortion one of the growing pains of trying to become a 
majority party 
this years state elections are considered especially important 
because they will determine which party will control congressional 
redistricting based on the 1990 census 
in 1990 no candidate can run for public office without 
squarely facing the abortion issue atwater said 
democrats running in 1989 for governor and lieutenant governor 
of virginia governor of new jersey and mayor of new york won by 
pressing their prochoice positions against gop candidates who had 
antiabortion records apparent attempts by the republicans to 
moderate their stances were ridiculed by democrats who atwater 
said pulled a reverse twist on us by borrowing a key atwater 
election strategy 
they defined our candidates before they defined themselves and 
thats almost always fatal atwater said what no voter likes 
is vacillating waffling or double talk 
at a news conference after his speech atwater said he bush and 
the national party would work diligently for prochoice republicans 
despite differences on abortion other republicans should also put 
party loyalty first he said 
he said that in private sessions with the gop leaders talks 
dominated by abortion politics there seems to be a consensus 
to welcome prochoice gop candidates without abandoning the partys 
antiabortion plank 
an attempt by one rnc member to get the meeting to reaffirm that 
plank failed thursday other participants said it was best to avoid 
such a move because of the problems it could cause some candidates 
bush however shows no signs of keeping his antiabortion views 
under wraps 
he vetoed two bills last year that would have allowed the use of 
federal funds for abortions in cases of rape and incest and the 
white house said friday that bush will address a rally of abortion 
foes via telephone monday the 17th anniversary of the supreme 
court decision legalizing abortion

toby sedgwick has been lying on a london stage 
this week pretending to be a slice of bacon sizzling in a pan 
as he twists and turns the room is filled with the smell of 
frying bacon at least to the noses of many of those watching 
sedgwick is a mime artist and some of the worlds best are 
performing in the 12th london mime festival the oldest event of 
its kind 
during the twoweek festival the mimes are performing in 
theaters concert halls local community arts centers 
universities even a library in london and in towns across england 
we have probably presented every major mime in the world 
festival director joseph seelig claimed in an interview 
mime is entertainment without words a form of theater practiced 
by the ancient greeks and romans seelig called it the art of 
creating illusion in silence without props or music just the 
body 
the worlds bestknown mime is probably frenchman marcel 
marceau who wears the white makeup of a clown a striped jersey 
and a tall hat and makes you believe he is climbing the stairs 
when there are none 
marceau has one style but he is so famous he has eclipsed the 
others seelig said charlie chaplin was a mime but nobody 
thinks of that 
because of marceau people think mime in france is bound to be 
the best and popular but it isnt so mime is wonderful in eastern 
europe and there are splendid american mimes 
dan kamin a busy american performer has his own show at the 
festival called confessions of an illusionist his book 
charlie chaplins oneman show is regarded by many in the 
profession as the definitive study of chaplins art 
mime blossomed in czechoslovakia because under the old hapsburg 
empire the austrian rulers made german the official language 
actors circumvented the prohibition on their own languages in 
theaters with mime theater which didnt need a license 
seelig called the czech mime bolek polivka who is taking part 
in the festival the greatest clown of our time 
polivka and his partner chantal poulain work with every 
theatrical trick in the book costumes masks puppets and illusion 
michael stanwood and jim jackson of denver ask in their mimic 
sole show is it art or are you just having a good time 
to the accompaniment of stanwoods autoharp keyboards and car 
spring jackson juggles dances on a tightrope and traps the unwary 
in gigantic soap bubbles 
between festivals seelig travels to see new acts and listen out 
for tips on who is new and good 
nineteen of 20 are a dead loss but the one can be something 
very exciting he said mime is a small world 
helen lannaghan the festival codirector said the budget is 
small and dependent on box office receipts with some help from the 
statefunded arts council income from all sources is 165000 
this years festival opened jan 15 and runs through jan 28

sticker bandits who found a loophole 
in a state health care plan for the poor may be cheating taxpayers 
out of more than 100 million a year a published report said 
all it takes to become a medical provider is to ask the 
state for a number and start sending in bills said carlo 
michelotti who heads medicals antifraud efforts 
under medical those who qualify for statepaid care each month 
get a card with five identification stickers when they receive 
medicine or medical supplies they pay by handing over a sticker 
and the pharmacy or store then bills the state 
but hundreds of people are stealing or buying the stickers 
using them to authenticate phony orders for diapers rubber sheets 
and pants and other incontinence supplies and then charging the 
state the san jose mercury news reported 
these supplies are especially difficult for medical specialists 
to keep track of michelotti said 
a diaper is a buck a pop he said its a pretty innocuous 
thing 
the crooks have discovered a weakness in the system and 
theyre busy driving trucks through it said steve adler chief 
of the state justice departments medical fraud bureau 
the amount being stolen in diaper scams is enough to pay for two 
doctor visits for every one of californias 33 million medical 
recipients according to the newspaper the state reimbursement is 
about 1 a diaper 
over the past nine months the justice departments medical 
fraud unit has been investigating seven alleged diaper bandit 
cases each involving millions of dollars last fall the owner and 
four employees of an oakland company were arrested and accused of 
defrauding the state of 9 million the case has not yet gone to 
court 
state health officials suspected ripoffs after the yearly 
payments for diapers and other incontinence supplies quadrupled in 
two straight years from 30 million to 120 million 
for the current fiscal year officials expect the bill to reach 
at least 150 million of which only 35 million is legitimate 
fifty people every week apply to become medical providers 
compared to about one application a week a few years ago 
michelotti said 
medical hopes for new rules sometime this year to allow the 
screening of applicants until then thousands of bills will be 
paid without question he said

attorneys for manuel noriega have forced the us 
government to protect documents confiscated from the homes and 
offices of the ousted panamanian leader and provide a list of the 
papers to the defense 
us magistrate william turnoff made the ruling friday after 
defense attorney steven kollin filed an emergency motion requesting 
the move 
kollin stated in his motion that assistant us attorney myles 
malman traveled to panama city to inspect material belonging to 
noriega that was seized by us troops during the invasion last 
month that removed noriega from power 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan refused to discuss 
malmans trip to panama but didnt object to the order 
it would be nearly impossible to determine which of the 
documents would have direct bearing on noriegas drug trafficking 
case sullivan said calling the defense motion unrealistic 
but turnoff ordered that the documents be protected and an 
inventory done but he told kollin the defense must give more 
specific information on the addresses of noriegas homes in panama 
city and rio hato and disclose which offices he occupied in the 
panama defense forces headquarters and fort amador 
the magistrate said the inventory of documents from noriegas 
houses must be available by thursday the day before noriegas bond 
hearing turnoff said that was because the defense contended some 
evidence from the homes may bear on the hearing 
earlier friday us district judge william hoeveler cautioned 
both sides to avoid intimidation in the case of noriega 
codefendant luis del cid but hoeveler refused to order government 
investigators to keep away from defense witnesses in that case 
an attorney for del cid complained that investigators from the 
immigration and naturalization service visited the defendants wife 
and two friends shortly after the three testified at a bond hearing 
tuesday and intimidated them about their residency 
del cids wife tilsa del cid is panamanian the other two 
women norma and eglantina alvarez are nicaraguan refugees 
hoeveler noted that the three women had offered to take custody 
of del cid if he is freed on bond 
it is important for me to get the full picture of what their 
status is hoeveler said but he added no investigator for 
either side can intimidate witnesses

mayor marion barrys top aide is running the 
city government while political advisers assess the mayors future 
in the wake of his arrest on a federal cocaine possession charge 
barry who said he is innocent of the crime wept friday when he 
told his cabinet he was turning over most of the reins of district 
of columbia government to his city administrator 
barrys arrest late thursday in an fbi sting operation at a 
washington hotel for allegedly smoking crack and his appearance 
before a federal magistrate friday threw the city government into 
turmoil and threatened to end his political career 
us attorney jay stephens told reporters a courtordered blood 
test administered to barry after his arrest came back positive 
barrys advisers many of whom have weathered years of federal 
investigations targeting barry were meeting again today to debate 
whether he can still consider running for a fourth term 
his aides were deeply divided at stormy meetings friday over 
whether the mayor should give up at least part of his duties and 
seek drug treatment according to a source familiar with the 
sessions who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the source said barrys cabinet assembled in a contentious 
session while the mayor met with some his own advisers barry 
eventually joined the full cabinet meeting rejecting suggestions 
that he enter a treatment program but telling his staff in a 
tearful statement that he would give up daytoday operations to 
city administrator carol b thompson 
barrys office said in a statement that the change in government 
was based on the mayors need for time to handle his legal 
affairs his concern for his family and because it is in the best 
interests of the citizens of washington dc 
the mayor canceled a rally scheduled for sunday at which he was 
to formally announce his candidacy for reelection 
jesse jackson whose april move to washington sparked rumors he 
would run for mayor said in chicago that he was stunned by barrys 
arrest and hoped the case would be tried in the courtroom not 
the newsrooms 
i think at this point its inappropriate to talk about the 
politics of the matter and the legal options until we get all the 
information about just what has happened he said 
a stonefaced barry and his wife effi walked through a sea of 
reporters outside the federal courthouse to get to his hearing 
before us magistrate deborah robinson he was released on 
personal bond and told he must submit to a urine test once a week 
outside the courthouse barry declined comment on the case or 
his political future and his lawyer said he would plead innocent 
to the misdemeanor charge if convicted the mayor could face 
penalties of up to one year in jail and a 100000 fine said 
stephens 
he faces another court appearance feb 5 
barry was lured to the fbirented room by an exlover who agreed 
to cooperate with investigators said a law enforcement who spoke 
on condition of anonymity the woman was identified by sources 
familiar with the case as rasheeda moore one source said ms moore 
agreed to cooperate after she got into trouble with state 
authorities in california 
according to court papers filed by federal prosecutors the room 
was watched through a surveillance camera and barry was taped as he 
gave a quantity of currency to a cooperating witness in return 
for the crack and smoked the cocaine in a pipe 
federal agents then entered the hotel room and arrested the 
mayor 
the washington post in todays editions quoted a law 
enforcement source who said barry was shocked shocked 
totally taken aback when the agents moved in 
at city hall other elected officials struggled to assure city 
workers and residents alike that the government will function 
despite the crisis created by barrys arrest 
it is very important that we retain some sense of normalcy 
said city council member betty ann kane after a closed meeting to 
discuss the crisis it was very somber in there with people 
still in a state of shock everyone is concerned about being able 
to reassure people that the city is not going to fall apart 
stephens dismissed suggestions the mayor may have been unfairly 
entrapped in the hotel sting operation 
the carefully planned carefully reviewed and carefully 
executed undercover operation was scrupulously fair to the 
defendant mr barry stephens said there was no entrapment 
there 
but many observers said the legal questions about the case are 
outweighed by the political damage the arrest will cause 
jeffrey gildenhorn a fundraiser for barrys reelection effort 
likened the mayors arrest to the mood of the president nixons 
white house as the pressures of watergate mounted in 1974 
i feel at this point a similar despair gildenhorn said

two groups are asking a federal court to make 
the government allow marijuana to be used for medical applications 
used as a drug for centuries marijuana has been known to have 
therapeutic potential for 150 years but its been illegal in the 
united states since 1937 
for the past 15 years most recently last month the drug 
enforcement administration has rejected bids to make marijuana 
available for such purposes as controlling nausea in cancer 
patients and treatment of glaucoma 
but groups went to federal court friday to try to overturn the 
deas latest decision and force the agency to change marijuanas 
status as a schedule i drug which is available only for research 
to a schedule ii drug which would make it available for patient 
use 
only synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol thc is available on 
schedule ii for use as a cancer chemotherapy antinauseant and 
kevin zeese counsel for the drug policy foundation says it 
doesnt work as well as the real thing 
studies by a halfdozen states comparing marijuana and the 
synthetic thc for their antinausea properties found marijuanas 
much more effective and much safer as well said zeese the 
foundation represented the national organization for the reform of 
marijuana laws and the alliance for cannibis therapeutics in the 
appeal with the us court of appeals 
zeese said that when patients are given synthetic thc a 
patient takes the whole pill and is stuck with the whole pill 
whether he needs it or not 
with thc youre taking the pure drug a much more 
mindaltering substance you see god on that stuff its like 
tripping zeese said marijuana is something the patient can 
control a cancer patient will take two smokes off a marijuana 
cigarette and thats all he needs 
the government provides marijuana for free in some cases when 
the food and drug administration approves use of the drug for 
compassionate medical purposes however medical marijuana 
advocates say the process is timeconsuming and discourages 
physicians from applying for the right to prescribe the drug 
the fda said at least 24 compassionate applications have 
been approved since the first in 1976 and some covered more than 
one patient robert randall of the alliance for cannabis 
therapeutics who suffers from glaucoma and was the first to get 
the fdas nod said he and four other patients have the only 
current government approval to use the drug 
zeese noted the latest appeal is the fifth time the issue has 
gone to court but said previous cases have been based more on 
procedural matters 
this is the first time the case is on the issue of whether 
marijuana has medical value zeese said 
the appeal targets the dec 29 decision by dea administrator 
john c lawn that overturned a recommendation by deas chief 
administrative law judge francis l young 
young in recommending that marijuana be placed on the less 
restrictive schedule called the drug one of the safest 
therapeutically active substances known to man

education secretary lauro cavazos is calling 
on college and university leaders to help ensure that advanced 
education is available for any american who wants it regardless of 
race or economic status 
he told the american council on education on friday by the 
year 2000 students from all population segments and economic 
groups who aspire to enter and complete programs of postsecondary 
education should have equal access to a quality education 
the bush administration and nations governors are preparing 
specific guidelines and timetables to improve learning mainly in 
elementary and secondary schools but cavazos said higher education 
leaders need to define their mission as well 
universities and colleges must assume leadership in 
restructuring education in america today he told about 1200 
educators in the luncheon speech 
cavazos declined to comment on an associated press story that 
said president bush will call in his state of the union address for 
guaranteed preschool programs for disadvantaged children and for a 
cut in dropout rates by about half by the end of the decade 
among the goals for advanced education cavazos proposed to 
reduce by half the gap the degree completion rates between 
black and hispanic students and white and asian students 
cavazos noted 55 percent of blacks and 51 percent of hispanics 
who enter higher education do not earn degrees compared with 33 
percent of other students 
make sure 50 percent of all bachelors degree recipients are 
able to demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language about 10 
percent of students now demonstrate such a proficiency 
guarantee that all associate and bachelors degree recipients 
are proficient in college level math and science can write 
coherent grammatically correct papers display a basic knowledge 
of world history geography and culture and have high critical 
thinking and problemsolving skills 
increase by 25 percent the number of college graduates 
completing doctoral programs in the basic arts mathematics 
sciences engineering and technological disciplines and by 50 
percent the number of women blacks indians and hispanics in the 
group 
cavazos stressed a special effort must be made in minority 
teacher preparation 
you must involve yourself in helping america restructure 
elementary and secondary education he said 
i must remind you that the quality of the student that comes 
to your university or college is totally dependent upon what is 
occurring in the public elementary and secondary schools of america

a first round of mideast negotiations is still 
beyond the reach of secretary of state james a baker iii after a 
busy week of diplomacy 
he wound up friday with egyptian foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid who left cautiously optimistic that baker would 
succeed eventually 
but the state department gave no indication of a breakthrough in 
a brief summary of their 45minute meeting and the egyptian did 
not claim one 
diplomatic sources said abdelmeguid on tuesday brought baker 
egypts suggestions for hurdling a dispute over palestinian 
participation in negotiations and that israeli defense minister 
yitzhak rabin took them back to jerusalem for consideration 
no details were provided by the sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity rabin was expected to follow up the proposals with 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir while israeli finance 
minister shimon peres is due to meet in cairo next week with 
egyptian president hosni mubarak 
i am cautiously optimistic about the outcome of this whole 
exercise because there is a keen interest and awareness of the 
necessity for peace for all of us in our area abdelmeguid told 
reporters after his third and final session with baker 
we have been discussing some very important points he said 
i am not in a position to say more about them 
asked if the gap had been narrowed he replied i think yes 
bakers intention is to have abdelmeguid and israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens hold a threeway meeting with him in 
washington in late february 
the main hurdle is what role if any is to be played by the 
palestine liberation organization 
israel wants to keep the plo out of the negotiations egypt is 
working with yasser arafats organization to try to gain a foothold 
in the talks 
even as baker pursued his diplomacy the state department took 
another slap at israel it criticized the detention of faisal 
husseini a proplo palestinian activist as detrimental to us 
peace efforts in the middle east 
although spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said us officials had 
not sorted out the allegations she read a statement that said we 
are surprised and disturbed by reports that husseini and other 
palestinians had been detained 
such actions discourage palestinian confidence in the peace 
process and contribute to the prevailing atmosphere of distrust 
the statement said 
while criticizing shamir on tuesday the state department also 
faulted the israeli policy of settling jews on the west bank and in 
gaza ms tutwiler said the establishment of new settlements or 
expansion of existing ones did not promote the cause of peace 
asked if the settlements also were illegal a position taken by 
the carter administration the spokeswoman said the bush 
administration had not addressed the question

threats against airlines real threats and 
hoaxes are sparking debate between air carriers and the federal 
government about whether the flying public should be kept informed 
after a lengthy meeting friday between officials of nine major 
us passenger airlines and the federal aviation administration an 
apparent consensus emerged that on extremely rare occasions 
informing the public is the prudent thing to do 
but faa administrator james b busey said after the session that 
his agencys official opposition remains unchanged at least so far 
currently the faa believes that publicizing threats against 
airlines would be counterproductive to the security process 
busey said 
the meeting was prompted by the recent decisions by northwest 
and delta airlines to publicize threats against some flights the 
disclosures were an exception to the industrys usual practice of 
taking such threats seriously and trying to nullify them but not 
making them public 
busey called the meeting a listening session and said it 
gave the airlines an opportunity to discuss the need if any for 
changes in the current policy toward threats against airline 
flights 
he said he believes these kinds of threats are most 
effectively handled by security professionals who are in a position 
to implement countermeasures 
jim buckhorn an faa spokesman said that as the session ended 
the consensus seemed to be that it wasnt a good thing to 
publicize all threats but that they agreed there are instances 
where it is the prudent thing to do 
buckhorn said most of those present agreed it was not a good 
idea to make public hoax telephone calls 
there are 600 or so such calls each year he said our 
experience has shown that publicity simply encourages more hoax 
telephone calls 
but busey said keeping the lid on most threats does not mean the 
safety of travelers is not fully taken into account 
the flying public should be aware that if a threat is 
determined to be specific credible and cannot be countered the 
targeted flight is cancelled he said 
buckhorn said busey will schedule a meeting later with 
representatives of the aviation consumer action project a consumer 
advocacy group which wants the faa and the airlines to fully inform 
the public when bomb threats are received

us military authorities are examining 
possible charges against two female soldiers who refused to drive 
other soldiers into downtown panama city at the peak of the us 
invasion according to defense department sources 
the sources who spoke on condition of not being identified 
told the associated press the women feared for their lives in 
the mission which involved ferrying troops into the sniperfilled 
city after sunrise on the first day of the invasion 
tears were involved said one source 
the source cautioned that although charges may be considered for 
such a thing as disobeying a direct order that does not mean that 
any would be brought charges are just being considered the 
source said 
army policy bars women from being sent into combat but some 600 
women were among the troops who invaded panama on dec 20 to oust 
dictator gen manuel antonio noriega 
these women were members of units assigned support 
functions not frontline combat roles even though some of their 
assignments resulted in females coming under fire 
capt linda bray has gotten wide publicity for leading a 
military police company engaged in a firefight before capturing a 
panamanian defense forces barracks and dog kennel 
a defense department spokesman lt cmdr ken satterfield 
declined to comment on the report that the women broke down in 
tears and refused to drive into a combat area he said he was 
unable to speculate on any possible charges being brought against 
the two women 
us army officials are looking into the incident and will 
determine what action if any is appropriate in the best interests 
of the army and the individuals concerned satterfield said 
asked about the details of the incident the spokesman said the 
two female soldiers were unable to make a trip to drive combat 
soldiers in the early morning hours of dec 20 
the two women were drivers assigned to the 193rd support 
battalion he said 
the drivers state of mind at the time was such that they felt 
they would endanger the lives of the combat soldiers they were to 
transport if they were to undertake the trip satterfield said 
because of the urgency of the mission they were replaced by 
soldiers assigned to the 193rd infantry brigade light who 
carried out the driving assignment he added 
the two women were returned to their unit and performed other 
driver duties the spokesman said 
the women belonged to a battalion that was supposed to provide 
support to all army units normally assigned to panama as well as 
the reinforcements brought in for the operation satterfield said

arthur j goldberg whose lifetime of public 
service was capped by his pivotal seat on the supreme court will 
be buried in arlington national cemetery 
goldberg was found dead friday by his maid when she entered his 
apartment he was 81 his physician dr michael newman said 
goldberg died overnight of cardiac arrest from coronary artery 
disease 
henry fleisher a longtime friend who said he had lunch with 
goldberg on wednesday said the former justice was found lying on a 
sofa where he apparently had been reading a newspaper 
goldberg lived alone since his wife the former dorothy kurgans 
died in february 1988 at age 79 she was an artist and author 
the couple had two children barbara and robert 
ralph destefano director of gawlers funeral home said 
goldberg will be buried in arlington national cemetery 
appointed to the supreme court on aug 29 1962 by president 
kennedy after 19 months as secretary of labor goldberg left the 
bench three years later at the urging of president johnson 
johnson then named goldberg un ambassador on july 20 1965 
after the death of adlai e stevenson at a time when us 
involvement in vietnam was escalating dramatically 
goldberg wrote johnson 
i shall not mr president conceal the pain with which i 
leave the court it has been the richest and most satisfying 
period of my career 
on the court goldberg was allied with chief justice earl warren 
and other liberals who asserted the courts authority against other 
government institutions and expanded its role as a protector of 
individual rights 
his appointment to the court provided the critical fifth liberal 
vote needed for many of those decisions 
justice william j brennan a fellow liberal who served with 
goldberg said friday that the former justice was very human a 
man of dignity and courtly bearing punctilious courteous 
cultivated a superb host 
in perhaps his most controversial supreme court opinion 
goldberg spoke for the court in a 54 ruling that threw out a 
confession by a murder suspect who was denied a lawyer during 
police questioning even though the suspect repeatedly asked to see 
his lawyer 
goldberg wrote if the exercise of constitutional rights will 
thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement then there 
is something very wrong with that system 
goldberg repeatedly defended the right of the poor to legal 
safeguards and due process 
in contrast to his supreme court years goldbergs tenure at the 
united nations was frustrating he resigned in april 1968 
separated from the center of power in the administration and with 
united states mired in the war in southeast asia 
goldberg after returning to the practice of law in new york 
was defeated by republican nelson a rockefeller in the 1970 race 
for governor of new york 
in 1971 goldberg returned to washington to practice law and 
teach at american university he remained active in public life 
he was appointed by president carter as us ambassador to a 
35nation conference in belgrade on human rights and headed a 
private commission that studied the role of us jewish groups 
during the holocaust 
goldberg was born in chicago on aug 8 1908 the last of 11 
children of russian immigrant parents his father joseph goldberg 
ran a business carting fruits and vegetables from the citys 
markets to hotels 
after graduating from northwestern university law school in 1929 
at the top of his class goldberg became a specialist in labor law 
when his appointment to the high court was announced goldbergs 
wife confided to reporters what was generally believed the job was 
the one her husband always wanted

president bush is calling on congress to 
approve clean air legislation but says he will veto any bill that 
costs substantially more than the proposal he sent to capitol hill 
last summer 
i will only sign legislation that balances environmental and 
economic progress the president said friday in a letter to sen 
bob dole rkan the senate minority leader 
bush noting that the senate is planning next week to begin 
floor action on a tough air pollution control bill said the 
proposal is twice as expensive as the administration proposal and 
the one under consideration in the house 
the cost to industry of toughening the nations air pollution 
controls is expected to be a major subject of debate as the 
legislation moves forward in congress in the coming months 
senate democrats have said in recent days that their bill is not 
substantially higher in cost from the bush proposal but the 
president in his letter to dole said administration estimates put 
its price tag at more than 40 billion a year compared to 19 
billion for the administration proposal 
at the same time maintained the president the senate bill 
provides little incremental environmental benefit over house 
and administration versions 
environmentalists have maintained the senate bill is much 
stronger and should be enacted

secretary of state james a baker iii 
grappling with eliminating foreign aid this year to more than a 
dozen friendly nations is seeking congressional support to 
disregard some legal restrictions on how aid money is distributed 
baker met with senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and minority leader bob dole rkan on friday to see whether 
lawmakers might permit some flexibility in the socalled 
earmarks congress imposed on fiscal 1990 foreign aid money 
dole said baker complained that the administration has a list of 
some 30 countries to which it wants to give a total of 16 
billion but has only 950 million in unearmarked money to hand 
out leaving a 650 million shortfall 
state department officials have come up with a series of 
scenarios under which some of the earmarked money roughly 150 
million to 250 million could be pared from its mandated 
recipients and given instead to more needy countries such as 
bolivia jamaica argentina peru and countries in the eastern 
caribbean 
some of these countries small countries important countries 
are going to be zeroed out dole told reporters he asked us if 
theres any chance leaders in the house and senate might go along 
with it 
state department officials have been agonizing over the 
allocations for this years foreign aid for weeks the allocations 
were supposed to have been decided last month but remain up in the 
air because of the shortfall

only the television industry could bring a 
dull convention to the city of mardi gras and bourbon street 
the glitter business known for choking our tubes with glitz 
gore and cheap canned thrills decided to be sober industrious and 
subdued this year 
in previous years the free booze flowed like water and each of 
the exhibitors from the national association of television 
programming executives put on a lavish buffet 
it got to be kind of a contest among the big guys to see who 
could outdo the other said one nostalgic executive wed 
compare notes and say youve got to do warner bros theyve got 
the crab claws paramount has the sushi 
this year there wasnt even a carrot stick in sight and the 
joint was lousy with perrier and diet coke 
there was food to be had said one disgruntled programmer 
but you had to sneak into the back room and gobble it like a kid 
embarrassing 
so much for the new sobriety 
in the good old days there was a glitz glut bigname show biz 
acts entertained the customers hulk hogan would body slam at the 
drop of a contract 
this year the world wrestling federations regulationsize ring 
was usually empty a mute reproach echoed by large thicknecked 
mournfullooking men in business suits the nondiaphanous robe of 
the duty angel at the highway to heaven almost reached to her 
knees 
there wasnt even a dog and pony show 
the 1990 rules of conduct grew out of a movement among west 
coast members reportedly pressured by disney chief michael 
eisenberg and other studio heavyweights to tone down the excesses 
the only way they could get it voted through was that if one 
did it we all did it said another executive who like the 
others didnt want to speak ill of his cohorts for the record 
next year well vote on it again 
you see this banana said a program buyer its the only 
thing ive had to eat between the hours of 730 am and 7 pm in 
three days 
it sure was fun though to watch the law of supply and demand 
in action in a year when exhibitors had roughly onethird more 
programming to sell than there were time slots to air it 
are we doing more business asked one executive when 
youre giving it away a dime on the dollar you might be doing more 
deals 
more than 200 exhibitors shelled out upwards of 6 a square foot 
to fill the huge new orleans convention center with plush carpeted 
enclosures tv monitors neon signs viewing rooms with comfy 
chairs and soft drink bars 
more than 8000 registered participants program directors and 
station managers from your local tv stations percolated up and 
down the aisles to take in the sights 
they got to meet vanna white of wheel of fortune and alex 
trebeck of jeopardy the toprated shows in syndication they 
shook hands with the eponymous geraldo oprah and sally jesse 
raphael not to mention joan rivers george jetson a teenage 
mutant ninja turtle and donald trump 
there was the world war iivintage torpedo plane above the itc 
booth where tic tac dough is making a comeback 
there was paramounts bank of tvs over a star trekstyle 
command desk buena vistas cavernous den behind the eerie 
silhouette of the disney castle and warner bros big logo in blue 
neon 
and there was the remarkably tanned fit and blond toni adams 
who identified herself as a tv personality for the us wrestling 
association 
she said she runs a summer camp and a wrestling school in texas 
and manages her husband wrestler gentleman chris adams so you

mission control ordered a 95minute 
delay saturday in the landing of the space shuttle columbia because 
of a problem in the spaceships computer system that was quickly 
resolved 
the waveoff call came just 25 minutes before commander dan 
brandenstein was to fire braking rockets to start the spaceship on 
an hourlong dive through the atmosphere to end the longest shuttle 
flight at edwards air force base calif 
touchdown which had been set for 301 am est was delayed 
until 436 am after columbia made one more swing around the 
globe 
mission control reported a switching problem in a backup 
computer but the astronauts were able to quickly resolve the 
trouble 
in normal configuation columbia has four primary computers 
working and one backup the control center directed the astronauts 
to restructure the system to shift one of the operating units to 
the backup position 
good job mike baker the spacecraft communicator in the 
control center reported after the task was done 
i dont want you guys to get the impression we dont want to 
come home or anything now commander dan brandenstein quipped 
referring to an earlier oneday postponement of the landing 
we were beginning to wonder baker replied 
mission control said the computer problem was believed to be a 
transient signal to be safe technicians took the computer off 
line 
columbia is able to operate with just two of its five computers 
working 
the spaceship and its five astronauts had planned to return home 
friday morning but the landing was waved off first by one 
orbit and then by a day because of a threat of fog that proved to 
be real at edwards air force base calif 
the weather was favorable saturday morning in the mojave desert 
columbia carries enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit 
until at least monday nasa officials said 
the astronauts had a light day friday working on a couple of 
experiments and snapping some more photographs of earth before 
going to bed around noon 
they were awakened friday evening to the strains of anchors 
aweigh for shuttle commander dan brandenstein and pilot jim 
wetherbee both navy men and the fight song for the university of 
wisconsin at river falls brandensteins alma mater 
good morning columbia wed like to know what it feels like to 
be record setters mission control said 
were at a loss for words brandenstein said 
it was the second time they were awakened their sleep was 
interrupted in the afternoon when an alarm sounded indicating 
there was briefly too much nitrogen gas in the nitrogenoxygen 
atmosphere inside the shuttle 
the alert didnt pose a threat to the mission and the crew went 
back to bed after checking a computer system that showed there were 
no further problems nasa said 
dense patches of fog were in the area at the planned landing 
time friday and even lingered on through the morning mission 
control reported flight rules dictate visibility of seven miles 
for landing 
so it looks like it was a good call to wave off today the 
control center said tomorrow edwards is looking real good 
should be just fine for landing we shouldnt have a fog problem 
tomorrow 
ok thanks and it looks like a great call not a good call 
brandenstein replied 
columbia is bringing home a scientific laboratory called the 
long duration exposure facility that the astronauts snatched from 
a weakening orbit using the shuttles 50foot robot arm ldef had 
been in space for nearly six years but it was being slowed by 
atmospheric drag 
the satellite was gradually sinking closer to earth and would 
have been destroyed in a fiery plunge through the atmosphere in 
early march if the astronauts hadnt saved it 
there were 57 experiments attached to ldefs exterior and 
scientists were anxious to see how the various materials in them 
fared during the long stay in space they can use that knowledge to 
design longduration spaceships and the planned manned space 
station 
youve made the retrieval and return of ldef look easy pete 
petersen director of nasas langley research center said in a 
message sent to the crew friday the center at hampton va built 
ldef and manages the project 
the ldef scientists look forward to a wealth of data that will 
have a major impact on future missions petersen said 
fridays delay not only made the flight the longest shuttle 
mission yet but it also set some records for the crew members at 
the planned landing time brandenstein will have logged 573 hours 
in orbit the most ever for a shuttle astronaut 
in addition mission specialist bonnie dunbar has spent more 
time in space than any other female astronaut completing 427 hours 
at landing 
even the other three crew members who are all firsttimers in 
space set a record pilot jim wetherbee and mission specialists 
marsha ivins and david low have spent more time in space 258 hours 
each than anyone else in their 1984 astronaut class 
the astronauts also released a navy communications satellite and 
worked on several medical and science experiments during the 
mission which is the 33rd shuttle flight and is a steppingstone 
toward monthslong trips aboard the space station starting in the 
mid1990s

gen manuel antonio noriega contemplated 
suicide during the time he was being stalked by us troops last 
month a longtime member of the former panamanian generals inner 
circle told the washington post 
mario rognoni a former cabinet member said noriega considered 
taking his own life because he didnt want to go down in history as 
the war trophy of some unknown american gi according to a report 
published in todays editions 
he was very conscious of history said rognoni 
rognoni who served as a noriega spokesman gave an account of 
noriegas days in hiding before he decided to seek asylum at the 
vatican embassy in panama city on dec 24 rognoni said some of his 
account was based on secondhand information from persons who 
were with noriega during the five days the general was in hiding 
but the post reported that a number of details conformed with 
accounts garnered from other sources 
rognoni said he maintained telephone contact with noriega 
through an intermediary during that period 
the general felt he had three options said rognoni to try to 
wage guerrilla war against the americans to seek asylum or to 
commit suicide 
on dec 23 as it became increasingly difficult to evade 
searching us troops noriega decided to take his life said 
rognoni but the former spokesman said he believes the general was 
talked out of suicide and opted to seek diplomatic asylum the next 
day 
rognoni was arrested by us forces on christmas and spent four 
days in detention noriega surrendered to us troops on jan 3 and 
was flown to miami to face drug charges

acting us attorney dexter lehtinen denied the 
reports of domestic violence contained in a 19month fbi background 
check but they were confirmed by his first wife and a former 
companion 
the investigation submitted to the white house two weeks ago 
also revealed that lehtinen had problems with former employers 
lehtinens temper had been mentioned as a possible liability in 
the prosecution of ousted panamanian dictator manuel noriega and 
he removed himself from the case last week amid reports the justice 
department didnt want him to try the case the miami herald 
reported friday 
lehtinen was appointed as acting us attorney in june 1988 by 
thenattorney general edwin meese justice sent the probe to 
president bush who must submit lehtinens name to congress for 
confirmation 
according to witnesses interviewed and documents obtained by the 
fbi during its investigation lehtinens smashed furniture and once 
shoved his former wife out of the house when their marriage was 
ending between 1982 and 1983 
lehtinen denied the allegations to the newspaper 
this article and many others will make a lot of allegations 
said his spokeswoman diane cossin embroidery and speculation 
are not worthy of comment 
lehtinens first wife donna stevenson said friday that 
dexter has a temper i do know he throws things and he yells 
she said ms stevenson denied lehtinen ever hit her however 
during a twoyear romantic relationship with his former 
legislative aide dolores zell lehtinen threw things at her shook 
her and once sprained her arm when he pushed her to the floor 
according to the fbi report 
the fbi asked about some incidents where specific things 
happened like whether i had ever seen anything thrown or have 
anything thrown at me or whether i had seen any furniture broken 
zell said 
she said she told the fbi that i had seen these things done 
and happen 
the fbi investigation is made up of raw data obtained from a 
variety of sources and no judgement is made on the credibility of 
the reports 
the herald also reported that lehtinen neglected to list one of 
his former employers on his official resume and that he would not 
confirm whether the omission was made on the employment history he 
gave to the justice department 
lehtinen was taken off the payroll of shutts and bowen a 
prominent miami law firm in 1982 because he rarely showed up for 
work even though he continued to draw paychecks the herald said 
on thursday he confirmed that he worked for the firm and that 
the firms managers were unhappy with the amount of work he did he 
said he told the fbi everything i know of but added that he 
didnt type those forms 
lehtinen said he did not know why his confirmation has been 
delayed justice department officials have told him a judiciary 
committee rules change caused the delay he said 
lehtinen graduated first in his class from stanford law school 
in 1974 became a prosecutor with the los angeles us attorneys 
office and then with the justice department organized crime strike 
force in miami 
in 1978 he left government service to pursue a political career 
and worked in private law firms and as an independent attorney in 
miami

the administration facing new action by 
congress is stepping up its defense of president bushs veto of 
legislation to let some 40000 chinese students remain in the 
united states after their visas expire 
the white house said friday that administrative actions taken by 
the executive branch of government gave the students relief that 
was as good or better than the steps outlined in the vetoed 
legislation 
but congressional democrats remained dissatisfied and senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine told reporters an attempt 
will be made to override bushs nov 30 veto when lawmakers return 
next week 
mitchell also accused bush of pursuing a wrongheaded policy 
toward the beijing government in the aftermath of the communist 
regimes crushing of the student rebellion in tiananmen square last 
june 
he said two secret missions bush approved to maintain contact 
with chinese leaders represented an embarrassing kowtowing to a 
repressive government those moves sent exactly the wrong 
signal to the soviet union and eastern europe he said 
if theres one thing we can deduce from the events in the 
world today we can deduce that the days of the current chinese 
leadership are numbered mitchell said we are aligning 
ourselves with old men whose days are numbered i think its 
adverse to our interests 
mitchell said he expects to await a test vote in the house 
before initiating action in the senate to reverse bushs veto of 
the chinese student relief bill 
the white house released a letter from attorney general dick 
thornburgh saying that in carrying out the presidents order the 
action i have taken affords relief equivalent to or greater than 
the relief that would have been provided under the vetoed bill 
in vetoing the bill bush said it was an infringement on his 
authority and could jeopardize exchange programs and uschina 
relations 
in his letter thornburgh said he complied with bushs order 
which relied on existing law to provide chinese students in the 
united states with irrevocable waivers of foreign residency 
requirements which they may exercise until jan 1 1994 
among other steps he said chinese nationals had received 
necessary authorization for employment in the united states 
moreover thornburgh said the immigration and naturalization 
service had established an outreach program to assist chinese 
nationals 
initial results of the program indicate that these outreach 
efforts have been successful and that chinese nationals are aware 
of the available options and are filing applications thornburgh 
said 
in most cases visas for visiting foreign students are issued 
for two years the bill bush vetoed would extend the students 
visas for more four years and then give them a chance to apply for 
permanent residency

space shuttle columbias astronauts 
photographed north africa for a film documenting damage to the 
planet monday as they whirled around the world on their seventh day 
in space 
clear skies gave the astronauts the chance to shoot pictures of 
lake chad the nile valley and fires in kenya for a giantscreen 
imax film called planet earth on the damage man and nature are 
doing to earth 
the five crew members also worked on several medical and 
scientific experiments that have been the focus of their 10day 
flight since the two main objectives releasing a satellite and 
capturing another were completed last week columbia is scheduled 
to land friday at 259 am pst 
the astronauts work day began a little early when their sleep 
was interrupted sunday by a buzzing alarm that signaled a brief 
problem with a navigation system but the five unexplained signals 
from a sensor on the system that tripped an alarm posed no threat 
to the mission and the astronauts returned to bed 
when they woke up as scheduled two hours after the alarm 
sounded mission control told them scientists had monitored the 
suspect unit but detected no further problems columbia commander 
dan brandenstein then successfully tested the system and put in 
back into operation 
everything is going well flight director al pennington said 
monday morning theyve had a very good day in fact theyre 
having a very busy day today 
during the day mission specialist bonnie dunbar had difficulty 
with one experiment in which she must seal the lower half of her 
body inside a container resembling a collapsible vacuum bag 
in the experiment an astronaut drinks a saline solution and 
spends time in the container which has gently pulls the bodys 
fluids toward lower body parts in space fluids tend to move 
toward the upper body researchers hope the two techniques will 
prevent astronauts from having trouble standing when they return to 
earth 
dunbar had trouble with the devices waist seal which 
apparently doesnt work quite the same in weightlessness as it does 
on earth and needed some assistance from mission specialists 
marsha ivins and david low 
mission control awoke the astronauts with the university of 
washington fight song dunbar is a washington graduate 
good morning for your second wakeup of the morning the 
control center said referring to the earlier alarm 
ground controllers also apologized to the crew for having to 
work on a holiday 
sorry you have to work through the martin luther king jr 
holiday but youre doing so well that no one wants to give you a 
break mission control said in morning messages sent to the crew 
via the shuttles fax machine 
columbia pilot jim wetherbee received a special message a 
certificate from sundays houston tenneco marathon wetherbee ran 
on a treadmill at about the same time his mother althea 
participated in the 262mile marathon mrs wetherbee had asked 
him to be her pace partner in space 
wetherbees certificate said he ran the marathon in 54 
seconds meaning that was how quickly he traveled 262 miles in 
space his 70yearold mother the oldest female to participate 
finished in four hours 59 minutes and seven seconds 
you were awarded an honorary completion certificate for the 
marathon many of us were surprised you werent disqualified for

china published new regulations today banning 
foreign journalists from actions the government deems harmful to 
society and from filing reports it views as false 
the broadly worded regulations give the government wide latitude 
for controlling foreign journalists following the jan 11 lifting 
of martial law in beijing the martial regulations had placed tight 
restrictions on reporters 
foreign journalists and resident foreign news organizations 
should observe professional news ethics and not distort the facts 
create rumors or use improper methods to interview or report 
said the regulations which were signed by premier li peng on 
friday and took effect immediately 
foreign journalists cannot carry out activities that are 
incompatible with their status or that endanger chinese national 
security unity or societys common interests the rules said 
the information department may give warnings or revoke the 
accreditation of journalists who violate the regulations one 
clause said 
china criticized as distorted most foreign reporting on the 
prodemocracy protests last spring and the june 34 army attack 
that crushed them killing hundreds and possibly thousands of 
people 
the government maintains the protests were a foreigninstigated 
plot to overthrow the communist system 
during the protests chinese consulates abroad stopped issuing 
work visas for visiting journalists and dozens entered with 
tourist visas 
in june the government expelled two american reporters based in 
beijing an associated press reporter and one from the us 
governmentfunded voice of america radio 
the new regulations do not explain what are considered improper 
methods of gathering information under martial law all interviews 
had to be approved by military authorities 
the regulations make no mention of informal or onthestreet 
interviews which were permitted before martial law was imposed may 
20 even since martial law was lifted however few chinese have 
dared to give onthestreet interviews even officials often regard 
interviews as political risks 
it was not clear if the new regulations supercede a 1986 set of 
rules that required foreign journalists to get approval 10 days in 
advance before leaving beijing to report elsewhere in china that 
rule has been used mainly to keep journalists from visiting tibet 
where buddhist monks and nuns have repeatedly demonstrated for 
independence

deputy chief elizabeth watson promised to 
continue the community work of her black predecessor as she becomes 
the leader of the nations largest police department ever directed 
by a woman 
mrs watson 40 succeeds lee brown who takes over as new york 
citys police commissioner monday brown was houstons first black 
police chief when he was tabbed in 1982 by mayor kathy whitmire 
who on friday named mrs watson 
mrs watson a 17year veteran of the force said she favored 
efforts by brown to get officers more involved at the community 
level especially with minorities an approach the mayor had said 
was a criterion in her search for a new police chief 
mrs watson had commanded several divisions worked five years 
as a detective and was assigned to an antiriot and terrorism squad 
at one time 
i am not lee brown in pretty obvious ways mrs watson said 
laughing but i do share his commitment and his vision to see 
policing in america become a partnership with the community 
mrs watson will lead a force of some 4500 officers whose 
morale is thought to be low houstons slow economy in recent years 
has prevented officers from receiving pay raises 
the department also has been held up for criticism in the wake 
of two recent fatal shootings of citizens 
in one a woman was shot to death in october after a freeway 
altercation with three offduty officers in november a security 
guard was shot after being pulled over for a traffic violation 
brown in one of his last acts as chief this week fired the 
four officers involved in those incidents 
the mayors nomination must be approved by the city council 
where initial reaction was positive 
i think this lady has done a great job councilman frank 
mancuso said she didnt get to be a deputy chief by accident 
she also received backing from mark clark president of the 
houston police officers association 
gerald arenberg executive director of the washingtonbased 
national association of chiefs of police said of her selection was 
remarkable considering 92 percent of police officers are men 
its always been a mans world he said to have a woman 
rise so rapidly and then be named head of one of the largest police 
forces thats an extraordinary circumstance he said 
the only large city to have female chief previously was 
portland ore which had a woman heading the force for 1 years a 
few years ago arenberg said 
a native of philadelphia mrs watson moved in 1963 to houston 
and attended public schools she was an honors graduate of texas 
tech university in lubbock 
mrs watson and her husband robert a police sergeant have two 
children

families of victims of the 1986 hijacking of a 
pan american world airways plane in pakistan can sue the airline 
for punitive damages a federal judge ruled 
the decision by us district judge john e sprizzo was at odds 
with an earlier federal ruling and is the latest interpretation of 
the warsaw convention on international air travel 
on jan 3 a federal judge in brooklyn thomas platt ruled that 
the treaty barred punitive damages for families of passengers 
killed in the december 1988 bombing of pan american flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland 
platt said the warsaw convention restricted international 
aviation lawsuits to compensatory damages and limited those damages 
to 75000 unless willful misconduct was proven 
sprizzo however disagreed in his decision thursday he said 
no language in the treaty expressly preempts or precludes 
punitive claims 
sprizzos ruling stemmed from more than 50 lawsuits filed by the 
families of victims of the hijacking of a pan am flight from 
bombay india to new york on sept 5 1986 
at a scheduled stop in karachi pakistan four gunmen seized the 
plane twenty passengers were killed and dozens more were injured 
a call to pan am for comment was not returned 
lee a kriendler an attorney representing plaintiffs in both 
the lockerbie and pakistan lawsuits said he has asked platt for a 
rehearing on his ruling in the lockerbie case he also sent platt a 
copy of sprizzos ruling 
in a previous ruling a federal judge in washington allowed 
plaintiffs in the 1983 korean airlines disaster to seek punitive 
damages from the airline 
that case involved the soviet shooting down of a kal plane 
carrying 269 people a jury awarded 50 million to about 130 
families the award is now under appeal

peggy mcmartin buckey acquitted in a 
preschool molestation trial that lasted nearly three years plans a 
return to court for a 1 million lawsuit that alleges malicious 
prosecution 
i feel i have a right to have a home again mrs buckey said 
friday my husband and i worked hard for what we had and to take 
everything away from someone whos done nothing its a 
nightmare 
buckey said the family has been living off her husbands 
earnings as an aircraft company electrical technician her and her 
mothers social security their daughters teaching salary and 
help from their church 
at a packed news conference buckey and members of her family 
told of death threats issued in the aftermath of the verdict and 
said they are considering moving out of southern california 
my husband was threatened in court yesterday buckey told 
reporters they told him youre gonna be killed 
the 63yearold mrs buckey and her son raymond 31 won 
acquittal of 52 felony charges on thursday because jurors said 
bizarre allegations of molestation at the mcmartin preschool 
appeared to be the result of coaching by parents and therapists 
a mistrial was declared on 13 other counts all involving 
raymond buckey the district attorneys office will have to decide 
whether to try those counts again 
the nations longest criminal trial cost over 15 million 
the suit filed friday names as defendants los angeles county 
the city of manhattan beach former district attorney robert 
philibosian childrens institute international and therapist kee 
macfarlane as well as capital citiesabc inc and its former 
reporter wayne satz 
i have no idea what her intent might be philibosian said 
similar lawsuits have been filed in the past and they are all 
routinely dismissed by the courts its not unusual for defendants 
to do this he said 
ms macfarlane said the lawsuit was the fifth filed against her 
by various former mcmartin defendants and every court that has 
been asked to consider them including the california supreme 
court has thrown them out she said 
my opinion both as a lawyer and a reporter is that this is 
an entirely frivolous and groundless kind of lawsuit said satz 
who often broke stories in the case in early 1984 
we stand by our coverage but we have not yet seen the legal 
papers was the response of a capital citiesabc spokeswoman in 
new york 
assistant los angeles county counsel robert ambrose refused 
immediate comment on the suit and manhattan beach city attorney 
carl newton was not in his office 
the lawsuit contended that all defendants joined in a conspiracy 
to have the mcmartin defendants indicted they were accused of 
defamation malicious prosecution conspiracy and violation of mrs 
buckeys civil rights the suit sought general damages of 1 
million and unspecified punitive damages 
mrs buckey who is the only plaintiff in the federal suit 
appeared at the news conference with her mother virginia mcmartin 
and her daughter peggy ann buckey who both were charged in the 
original child molestation case but had their cases dismissed

in a case closely watched by 
the us congress and human rights activists the director of el 
salvadors military college and eight other soldiers were charged 
with murdering six jesuit priests 
judge ricardo zamora of the 4th penal court on friday ordered 
col guillermo benavides three lieutenants and four enlisted men 
to stand trial the murder charges imply premeditation and 
perfidy and carry a maximum sentence of 30 years court secretary 
nicolas hernandez said 
a fifth enlisted was charged but he deserted in december and is 
a fugitive 
the new rector of the jose simeon canas central american 
university where the priests taught and were slain called the 
investigation insufficient 
we believe the investigation as to who was behind this is 
lacking a series of elements said the rev francisco estrada 
it seems to us strange that a sole colonel would have decided to 
commit a crime of this magnitude 
all six priests were educators at the university one of the 
regions leading institutions the priests their housekeeper and 
her teenage daughter were dragged out of their beds on the night of 
nov 16 and fatally shot by uniformed men 
benavides chief of the military college and a former head of 
military intelligence is the highest salvadoran officer ever 
charged with a human rightsrelated crime 
no officer has been convicted of such a crime even though 
rightist death squads killed thousands of suspected leftists in the 
early 1980s 
all the defendants except benavides and lt rene mendoza who 
was also at the military college are members of the elite 
ustrained atlacatl infantry battalion 
the unit had been assigned to benavides to provide security for 
the rear section of the college the campus is on the south side of 
the military college 
i dont want any witnesses two accused lieutenants 
gonzalo guevara and jose espinoza quoted benavides as telling 
them shortly before midnight nov 15 when he allegedly ordered the 
killings 
ok gentlemen were playing for keeps its either them or 
us because they have been the intellectuals directing the 
guerrillas for a long time guevaras testimony quoted benavides 
as saying 
the massacre took place during a major offensive by leftist 
guerrillas in the countrys decadeold civil war rightists often 
accuse clergymen of helping the leftists and the killings of the 
jesuits raised fears of a return to the days of wholesale slaughter 
by death squads 
the killings also prompted calls in washington for a 
reevaluation of the 15 million in military and economic aid the 
united states provides el salvador daily 
zamora issued his ruling at the end of a 72hour deadline that 
began tuesday when the prisoners who have been under arrest since 
early january were put at the disposition of the court 
the court order opens a 120day period during which the case is 
prepared for trial but this phase can be delayed by motions 
in the pretrial depositions made public friday several of the 
soldiers described how five of the priests including then rector 
ignacio ellacuria and vicerector ignacio martinbaro were roused 
from bed taken to the yard behind their home and forced to lie 
face down in the grass 
two of the men charged sgt antonio avalos and pvt oscar 
amaya admitted they fatally shot them avalos said he understood 
espinoza gave the order to fire and that if he disobeyed he 
would be accused of treason 
espinoza guevara and mendoza denied they were involved in the 
killing but admitted they took part in the operation benavides 
deposition was not made available but court sources said he denies 
the murder charge 
cpl angel perez admitted fatally shooting the rev joaquin 
lopez y lopez the sixth jesuit inside the house sgt tomas 
zarate admitted shooting the housekeeper elba ramos and her 
15yearold daughter celina 
avalos testified that as he was going out of the building he 
heard people groaning from within a dark room and thought they 
must be people who had been shot but not dead he said he and 
fugitive defendant pvt jorge sierra went to the door 
avalos says he lighted a match and saw two women on the floor 
hugging each other and whimpering so he ordered sierra to finish 
them off and sierra fired a burst of about 10 rounds from his m16 
automatic rifle until they stopped whimpering 
several defendants described how the murder squad staged a mock 
battle including firing rifles and exploding rockets grenades and 
flares after the slayings

a judge sentenced former us rep robert garcia 
to three years in prison but said he would be eligible for parole 
after six months since his crimes were less serious than others 
convicted in the wedtech scandal 
us district judge leonard sand said he felt the sentence was 
the most lenient he could give garcia convicted with his wife of 
extorting payoffs from wedtech corp the nowdefunct defense 
contractor 
his wife jane lee garcia received the same sentence and parole 
order as garcia 
garcia a 58yearold democrat resigned his congressional seat 
earlier this month he had represented the economicallyblighted 
south bronx where wedtech was located for 12 years 
former new york knicks basketball star earl the pearl monroe 
has agreed to run for the seat in a march special election 
according to a report in the daily news today monroe a 
republican runs a music production company 
sand conceded that garcias crimes were less than others 
convicted in the wedtech scandal but said he felt garcia had to 
spend some time in prison as a deterrent and as an example 
you yielded to the temptation of betraying your office so you 
and your wife might enjoy a higher lifestyle the judge said 
sand imposed no fines on the garcias after their attorneys said 
they were completely destitute and recently had lost even their 
apartment garcia asked for leniency for himself and mercy for his 
wife 
he apologized to his former constituents but said he would 
pursue and appeal 
for years i worked long and hard for the people ive 
represented garcia said i never tried deliberately to harm 
them 
mrs garcia 49 told the judge that the hardest part of the 
ordeal for her and her husband has been consoling those close to 
them 
the past three years have been more difficult than anything 
you can imagine she said 
the garcias were the last major defendants tried in the 
wideranging corruption scandal at wedtech 
evidence at the trials showed that wedtech once a small machine 
shop grew into a multimilliondollar defense contractor through 
various bribe schemes the company collapsed in 1986 amid 
allegations of corruption 
a jury in a verdict returned oct 20 found that the garcias 
extorted 76000 from the wedtech corp from 1984 to 1986 in return 
for help in obtaining government contracts wedtech channeled them 
a 20000 interestfree loan through garcias sister 
in 1988 former us rep mario biaggi was convicted of 
racketeering charges and was sentenced to eight years in prison 
others convicted in the scandal were former bronx borough 
president stanley simon who received an eightyear term and e 
robert wallach a close friend of exus attorney general edwin 
meese who was sentenced to six years

president virgilio barco told his 
countrymen that despite an apparent concession of defeat by drug 
traffickers the government will continue to fight them to ensure 
its final success 
in washington the bush administration which backs colombia in 
its fight against the drug lords said its position also remained 
unchanged 
in a communique friday barco said the country has not 
allowed itself to be carried away by hasty expectations it should 
maintain that attitude 
he said it was necessary to take the best road to ensure the 
final success of the policy followed by the government supported 
by the colombian people and the international community 
officials have mounted a major effort to stamp out the 
traffickers since august when cocaine lords were blamed for the 
killing of a leading presidential candidate earlier this week 
traffickers from the medellin cartel released three hostages and 
issued a message admitting defeat and asking for amnesty 
in its message wednesday the group used the name 
extraditables referring to the governments policy of 
extraditing drug suspects wanted in the united states several 
colombian officials have said it was merely a ploy to lure barco 
into ending extraditions 
since august colombia has extradited 13 drug suspects to the 
united states 
other officials expressed concern that medellin cartel leaders 
are trying to persuade the government to include them in an amnesty 
recently offered to leftist guerrillas for past political crimes 
barcos communique appeared to rule out both an end to 
extradition and an extension of the amnesty to drug traffickers 
the national government and authorities at all levels will 
continue completing their duty of enforcing the law and bringing 
criminals to justice using constitutional and legal procedures and 
the alternatives offered by the current judicial order it said 
barco reiterated the governments demand that drug traffickers 
keep their promises to end assassinations and other terrorist 
violence to free all hostages and to abandon their billiondollar 
cocaine business 
the traffickers responded to the governments crackdown with 
bombings and assassinations that killed 209 people and injured 
1243 
our position is still the same white house secretary marlin 
fitzwater said friday in washington we have traditionally been 
opposed to deals with the cartel essentially its a matter for 
colombia to deal with 
the cartel currently holds at least 18 hostages including 
alvaro diego montoya the son of barcos general secretary and 
closest adviser german montoya

an appeals court overturned the convictions of 
three former executives believed the first ever to be found guilty 
of murder for the workrelated death of an employee 
the illinois appellate court ruled friday that the three top 
officials of the nowdefunct elk grove villagebased film recovery 
systems inc had been wrongly convicted of murder and other charges 
in the 1983 cyanide poisoning death of stefan golab 
cook county states attorney cecil partee said he would appeal 
the ruling to the illinois supreme court 
we are taking this case to the supreme court because we 
believe workplace safety to be an extremely important issue 
partee said the evidence showed that the defendants went out of 
their way to hide the dangers from their employees and knowingly 
failed to protect them from obvious harm 
golab 61 a polish immigrant worked at the plant where cyanide 
was used to recover silver from used xray film he collapsed at 
work after complaining of dizziness and nausea 
prosecutors likened the plant to a huge gas chamber 
the defunct companys former president steven j oneil plant 
manager charles kirschbaum and foreman daniel rodriguez were 
convicted of murder involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct 
in a bench trial before circuit judge ronald jp banks they were 
sentenced to 25 years in prison but were free pending an appellate 
ruling 
their appeal argued the convictions were inconsistent because a 
murder conviction requires a different mental state than does a 
conviction for involuntary manslaughter or reckless conduct said 
elliot samuels who represented kirschbaum and rodriguez in the 
appeal 
murder requires deliberate intent while a verdict of reckless 
conduct requires a state of mind somewhere between negligence and 
indifference samuels said 
the appellate court agreed saying the convictions were 
legally inconsistent 
partee said he believes the appellate court made the wrong 
ruling 
the appellate court found that the evidence at the trial was 
indeed sufficient to sustain the convictions beyond a reasonable 
doubt partee said in a statement 
this issue is much too important to surrender on the basis of 
a hypertechnical reading of the law 
mayor richard m daley who prosecuted the case while he was 
states attorney supported an appeal 
the earlier decision was precedentsetting nationally in terms 
of the protection that it gave to working men and women said 
daleys spokeswoman avis lavelle 
witnesses testified at the circuit court trial that film 
recovery workers were not told they were working with cyanide or 
that compounds used at the plant could be harmful 
prosecutors also said the plant was manned largely by illegal 
polish and hispanic immigrants most of whom spoke or read very 
little english 
the defense said the three officials were responsible managers 
had no idea conditions were dangerous and worked at the plant 
themselves

station in a moslem city in soviet azerbaijan had broadcast a 
declaration of independence from the soviet union 
the report came as soviet troops moved into the azerbaijani 
capital of baku killing at least 60 people in a crackdown on 
ethnic unrest soviet news reports said 
the islamic republic news agency quoted the tv announcement as 
saying soviet troops should leave nakhichevan on the iranian 
border 1200 miles south of moscow 
nakhichevan is part of azerbaijan but separated from the rest of 
the republic by a strip of armenian territory the enclaves 
capital city also is called nakhichevan 
irna monitored in cyprus said its correspondents on the 
iranian side reported seeing a power blackout during the night on 
the soviet side 
the television in nakhichevan broadcast its resolution three 
times following martial music irna said the resolution called for 
independence from moscow a pullout of soviet troops and an end to 
alleged soviet aggressions in nakhichevan 
it also called on turkey iran the united nations and world 
governments to help safeguard nakhichevans territorial integrity 
and prevent a massacre the agency said 
the television said its resolution was taken because of the 
terror caused by alleged attacks by armenians 
violence first broke out in the 2200squaremile enclave in 
november 1988 when armenian media said gangs of azerbaijanis 
ransacked armenian homes in nakhichevan it broke out again a week 
ago with the current unrest all over azerbaijan 
meanwhile official tehran radio said thousands of azerbaijanis 
streamed into iran this morning across a border bridge in astara a 
resort town on the black sea

friday and staged a demonstration in support of spiritual leader 
ayatollah ali khamenei chanting god is great and khamenei is 
the leader 
they also participated in the traditional moslem friday prayer 
service the agency said

azerbaijanis waving identical copies of the koran apparently 
donated by the iranians as well as pictures of the snowcovered 
border region with soviet armored vehicles patrolling the border

smuggling in weapons provided by iran

followers of the late bhagwan shree 
rajneesh the freelove guru who was expelled by the united states 
today danced meditated and chanted the mystics favorite mantra 
hoo hoo hoo a day after his death of a heart attack 
rajneesh also made a final appearance before 10000 of his 
followers in a videotape and told them think deep go deeper 
the 58yearold mystic has not named a successor and his death 
friday launched a wave of speculation about the future of his 
commune its 500 worldwide branches and its claimed 500000 
members 
the videotape was played at the mystics southern commune in the 
city of poona where rajneesh set up an international headquarters 
after his deportation from the united states in 1985 
osho is very much here said follower ma yoga using an 
honorific name that rajneesh called himself in recent years the 
term means on whom the heavens shower flowers bhagwan is a 
hindu honorific meaning god 
it is like any other day here it does not matter if osho has 
left his body said ma yoga a member of the 23yearold cults 
poona commune in a telephone interview he lives the commune 
lives 
a statement from the commune quoted the guru as saying hours 
before his death my work will go on and grow stronger after i 
leave my body 
in a statement telexed from poona rajneeshs personal doctor 
said the guru was in pain for many weeks before his death 
i asked osho if he wanted us to prepare for cardiac 
resuscitation and he said no if i die it will be relief from 
the pain said british physician swami amrito 
rajneesh died of a heart attack according to a doctors death 
certificate 
however a commune statement released today said the guru died 
because living in the body had become a hell 
it repeated rajneeshs charges he was poisoned in us jails 
before he was deportedwhile he was in oklahoma county jail in 
oklahoma state he was poisoned with heavy metal thallium they 
exposed him to radiation in a way that it will not leave any 
proof 
thallium is used in making rat poison 
local health officials said rajneesh suffered from aids but the 
commune denied those reports about two years ago 
rajneeshs most famous commune the rancho rajneesh was founded 
in oregon in 1981

scrubby hills near antelope ore drawing thousands of slavish 
disciples they were rewarded with the gurus daily driveby in 
one of his 93 rollsroyces many painted psychedelic colors and 
some decorated with peacocks and lacy curtains 
to many nearby residents the commune known as rajneeshpuram was 
a monstrous intrusion it was disbanded in 1985 when rajneesh a 
native of india was expelled from the united states in a plea 
bargain on immigration fraud charges

rj reynolds tobacco cos decision to 
cancel a planned test marketing of a cigarette aimed at blacks is a 
victory for health the nations top health official said 
reynolds announcement on friday came a day after health and 
human services secretary louis sullivan attacked the company for 
promoting a culture of cancer 
the company said antismoking advocates misrepresented reynolds 
plans for a campaign that was to begin in philadelphia in three 
weeks for a new menthol cigarette called uptown 
we regret that a small coalition of antismoking zealots 
apparently believes that black smokers are somehow different from 
others who choose to smoke and must not be allowed to exercise the 
same freedom of choice available to all other smokers said peter 
hoult reynolds executive vice president of marketing 
sullivan said he was elated by the companys decision 
this is a victory for the citizens of philadelphia for 
minority citizens and indeed for all americans a victory for 
health he said 
in a speech in philadelphia on thursday sullivan who is black 
said reynolds message was more disease more suffering and more 
death for a group already bearing more than its share of 
smokingrelated illness and mortality 
officials with the winstonsalem ncbased company have said 
they hoped the cigarette would appeal to blacks who as a group 
prefer menthol cigarettes according to the companys market 
research 
philadelphia was chosen because blacks make up 40 percent of the 
population the company said 
our intentions in test marketing uptown in philadelphia have 
been misconstrued and misrepresented by the antismoking lobby 
hoult said our sole purpose plainly and simply was to test 
market a cigarette among smokers who currently buy competitive 
products 
company spokesman david fishel said the immediate future of 
uptown is unclear adding well just have to evaluate the 
situation 
in philadelphia leaders of about 30 organizations which had 
banded together to fight uptown expressed joy that the company 
decided to heed their opposition 
the rev jesse brown president of the committee to prevent 
cancer among blacks called the decision magnificent 
we are glad that rj reynolds decided to hear us he said 
we dont want this cigarette to be marketed in any city this 
sends a signal to rj reynolds that community groups can rise up 
and deal with them 
he said that sullivans public condemnation of the marketing 
plan was the icing on the cake to the local opposition 
charyn sutton a member of the philadelphia chapter of the 
national black leadership initiative on cancer and a marketing 
consultant for the american lung association said rj reynolds 
had to face marketing facts 
im personally pleased that the company heard the community 
they had said this was a cigarette that the community wanted but 
we felt there had been no such request that way she said 
the companys promotional blitz included ads suggesting glamour 
high fashion and nightlife 
sullivan in a letter to rj reynolds noted that cigarettes 
cause an estimated 390000 deaths or more than 1 in every 6 
annually in the united states making it the countrys leading 
cause of preventable death 
statistics from the us public health service show that black 
men have a 58 percent higher incidence of lung cancer than white 
men and blacks lose twice as many years of life as do whites 
because of smokingrelated diseases

aldo gucci who helped turn his fathers italian 
luxury leather goods company into an international symbol of chic 
but whose own son later implicated him for tax evasion has died 
he was 84 
no information on when or where he died or the cause was 
supplied in a statement friday from gucci america in new york 
announcing his death there was no answer at gucci offices in italy 
today 
but the italian news agency ansa today reported from florence 
where the company was founded that gucci died at a rome clinic 
where he had been hospitalized a week ago for treatment of prostate 
cancer 
ansa said the funeral would be held at a roman catholic church 
in rome on monday and that the body would be transferred to 
florence for burial in the family mausoleum at a cemetery in that 
tuscan city 
on friday peggy rao who has handled public relations for gucci 
in palm beach fla told the palm beach post newspaper that she 
had been informed that he died of a cerebral hemmorhage 
gucci was responsible for marketing his familys products in the 
united states in 1986 he pleaded guilty to evading 7 million in 
taxes and was later implicated in a corporate tax evasion scheme 
the gucci company was founded in 1906 in florence by guccio 
gucci a leather goods salesman 
it was with some reluctance that he watched his son aldo expand 
overseas a drive that resulted in 180 stores and about 82 percent 
of the parent companys sales today aldo gucci opened the 
companys first american store in new york city in 1953 
aldo also brought his sons giorgio paolo and roberto and his 
nephew maurizio into the executive ranks paolo later implicated 
him for tax evasion and maurizio had him ousted in 1984 
in a statement issued friday maurizio said of his uncle aldo 
gucci was a man of great vision his efforts were instrumental in 
establishing gucci as the premier name in luxury leather goods in 
the united states 
the tax evasion case began when paolo proposed more inexpensive 
products and licensing and was opposed by his relatives 
in one of two lawsuits paolo filed against the others he 
charged that the family blocked his efforts to trade under his own 
name and he produced documents showing that aldo then 81 had 
evaded taxes 
the internal revenue service obtained the documents and aldo 
pleaded guilty to evading 7 million in personal income taxes in 
federal court in manhattan in 1986 he was sentenced to a year in 
prison but was allowed to serve part of the sentence at a halfway 
house in west palm beach 
in 1984 maurizio used his 50 percent of the company to seize 
control oust aldo and bring in new young useducated managers 
aldo gucci resigned as president of gucci america in 1984 and 
was replaced by domenico de sole 
in 1988 gucci america admitted that the company under aldo 
had conspired to cheat the government of corporate taxes between 
1972 and 1982 and the firm paid the government 205 million in 
back taxes interest and penalties 
a lawyer for the company told a judge at the time that gucci 
america had foreign corporations submit false invoices for services 
never rendered and other phony documents to divert money to aldo 
gucci who kept some and distributed the rest among other members 
of the family 
at the time of his death aldo gucci was still acting as a 
consultant to the company

hardline and liberal communists 
today clashed at a key party congress over how quickly to renounce 
their 45yearold monopoly on power and hardliners succeeded in 
delaying a vote on democratic reforms party president milan 
pancevski told the congress that the current system of oneparty 
socialism had objectively exhausted its possibilities for 
development 
delegates at the fourday meeting considered a document that 
backs free elections and a multiparty system and proclaims the 
partys readiness to relinquish its guaranteed grip on power 
the opening of the congress broadcast live on belgrade tv was 
marked by heated debate with some delegates demanding that the 
document be adopted as soon as possible and other cautioning 
against a rushed decision 
several delegates from the liberal northern republic of slovenia 
urged the document be adopted as it stands as one of the first 
agenda items hardliners mostly from the largest republic of 
serbia wanted it discussed in committee and adopted together with 
other documents at the end of the congress 
the hardliners succeeded in sending it to committee leading to 
speculation that it could be watered down there although 780 
delegates favored the documents immediate adoption 645 voted 
opposed it denying the motion for a vote the needed twothirds 
majority 
stefan korosec who presided over the morning plenary session 
said the document would be debated in committee sessions and 
adopted at the end of the congress 
retired gen dusan pekic proposed that the communists urge 
parliament to quickly delete the partys leading role from the 
constitution but delegates voted this down noting this demand was 
contained in the draft reform document 
the declaration published last week in the yugoslav press 
admits that the oneparty system of monopoly has pushed us into 
autocracy and prevented us from keeping up with the economic 
technological political and social changes in europe and the 
world 
the party advocates freeing the political system of any 
monopoly including that of the communists says the document 
which was published and distributed to the press before the 
congress opened 
proclaiming that the end has come for authoritarian 
socialism the document says the system of political monopoly 
has pushed us into autocracy and prevented us from keeping up 
with the economic technological political and social changes in 
europe and the world 
it calls for free independent trade unions a legal guarantee 
of ethnic and other human rights independent courts parliamentary 
control over the government and a market economy with mixed 
ownership 
the draft document also advocates application for membership in 
the european economic community and other european trade groups 
todays congress originally scheduled for may but moved ahead 
to keep up with the reforms sweeping eastern europe immediately 
took up debate on the document and the pace of proposed changes 
deputy premier zivko pregl told a news conference friday the 
government also would propose constitutional amendments to 
parliament deleting all references to the partys leading role and 
reforming the electoral process 
we dont feel any political organization or party should be 
in the constitution pregl said 
pregl said draft legislation laying the groundwork for 
multiparty elections would be completed at a government meeting 
jan 25 he predicted it would be adopted by parliament by march 1 
the government of premier ane markovic has begun putting into 
effect an ambitious marketoriented economic program but pregl 
said accompanying political changes were also necessary 
yugoslavia broke with the soviet union in 1948 and established a 
largely decentralized communist system 
pregl noted that yugoslavia had been the most liberal of the 
communist countries until reform surged through the east bloc in 
the fall forcing the communists in most countries to give up their 
hold on power 
communists in the liberal northern republics of slovenia and 
croatia have long tolerated noncommunist political groups and 
expressly called for multiparty elections but hardline communists 
in the largest republic of serbia had until recently opposed 
lifting communist dominance 
last month the serbian communists also said they backed 
multiparty democracy 
the army has repeatedly rejected multiparty democracy it says 
parties would be formed along ethnic lines further aggravating 
tensions in this fractious country of varied ethnic and religious 
groups many of whom still harbor historical rivalries 
petar simic head of the communist leadership in the army said 
in a speech published friday in the daily borba that the army would 
not retreat from the idea of communism 
the army in yugoslavia has a political role unmatched elsewhere 
in eastern europe communist leaders in the military are 
represented on all local and federal bodies fully 95 percent of 
the army officers are communist party members 
if multiparty elections are held in april as promised by 
communist leaders the army would no longer be guaranteed a role in 
political decisionmaking 
however simic said the army will accept the arguments and the 
will of the majority at the congress 
yugoslav media this week predicted possible clashes between 
party hardliners and liberals despite tentative agreement on 
democratic reforms

after seven years of preparation the census 
bureau is closing in on its biggest job ever a reasonably precise 
tally of the estimated quarterbillion people who live in america 
the national head count scheduled for april 1 is just over two 
months away 
but the results will reverberate through american life for a 
decade or longer through the distribution of seats in congress and 
billions of dollars in federal money 
in addition it will offer details on habits incomes and living 
arrangements 
this will be the 21st time the united states government has set 
out to make an exact count of its denizens that goal has never 
been reached but census officials expect to come closer than ever 
we are prepared to chase and chase and chase again said 
census director barbara e bryant the bureau estimates that it 
counted 984 percent of the population in 1980 
this census has already generated controversy over counting 
illegal aliens and homeless americans adjusting the expected 
undercount to make sure the figures reflect the real number of poor 
and minority group members and hiring the 300000 temporary 
workers needed 
the census is in fact the product of a political compromise at 
the heart of how this nation is governed 
since the states couldnt agree on their representation in 
congress they decided to count the population every 10 years and 
use that result to adjust the house of representatives 
that was done for the first time in 1790 when federal marshals 
went out and counted heads 
they found 3929214 that resulted in a complaint from 
president washington who said he was sure there were at least 4 
million people in the country 
similar complaints have followed every count since then and have 
already surfaced this time in the form of a lawsuit asking that 
the 1990 count be adjusted upward 
adjustment of census data is a demographic pandoras box 
says agriculture department population expert calvin beale i 
hope it does not happen 
regardless of whether there are 4 million or 250 million people 
counting everyone is a problem 
some people dont want to be counted some are away from home 
some are simply overlooked some fear government officials or lack 
interest in official activities 
the distribution of billions of federal dollars is based on 
census counts making the tally especially important for the poor 
minorities and others who depend on government programs 
cities with large minority populations would like to see the 
final numbers adjusted to allow for the likelihood that blacks and 
hispanics will be undercounted 
another hardtocount group is the nations growing army of 
homeless people 
this has prompted a special effort scheduled for the night of 
march 20 when census takers will visit homeless shelters homes 
for battered women and flophouses and will walk the streets and 
alleys looking for homeless people to be counted 
such an effort is reminiscent of the oldfashioned census 
methods when enumerators went from home to home to make the count 
in recent years that has given way to a mail count with census 
forms being mailed march 23 to 80 percent of homes with people 
asked to mail them back as of april 1 
officials are hoping for a strong mailback response since 
people who dont fill in the form and send it back must be visited 
later by census takers 
that visit costs money though and with the count expected to 
cost 26 billion overall the government doesnt want to spend any 
more than necessary 
one question that has come under nearly continual discussion 
since census preparations began in 1983 is the problem of illegal 
aliens who are believed to shun government workers out of fear of 
being deported 
politicians from states with few illegal aliens have complained 
that these people should not be counted because that would result 
in an unfair increase in the number of congress seats given to 
states with plenty of undocumented aliens 
the constitution however specifies that all persons must 
be counted not just citizens so everyone is included 
census officials note that they dont ask if people are 
citizens so they have no way of knowing whether a person is a 
legal or illegal resident of the country 
overall 110 million households are expected to be counted 
totaling about 250 million americans most will get the short form 
taking about 15 minutes to fill out one home in six will get the 
long form which takes about 45 minutes

from central asia to the caucasus and the baltics 
ancient ethnic grievances and nationalist fervor are rising in the 
security cordon the kremlin built 
grudges among neighbors that simmered quietly under the soviet 
facade of brotherhood and demands for independence ultimately 
could erode moscows vast empire 
the breeding grounds are southern deserts the caucasus 
mountains the fields and forests of moldavia the black fertile 
soil of the ukraine and the baltics in the north in those areas 
live many of the soviet unions more than 100 nationalities 
president mikhail s gorbachev facing bitter strife between 
armenians and azerbaijanis told the country he was struggling with 
a legacy of ethnic hatred 
the problems which have been accumulating for tens no for 
hundreds of years have erupted and acquired the character we are 
now confronted with he told a meeting in moscow on thursday 
in lithuania less than a week earlier where gorbachev was 
trying to rein in a peaceful but determined secessionist movement 
the soviet leader openly worried that demands for independence 
could lead to the unions disintegration on ethnic grounds 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost and democratic reforms has let 
genies out of bottles in many cases with violent consequences 
formerly underground and longrepressed groups seek secession from 
the soviet union for georgia armenia moldavia latvia lithuania 
and estonia 
long before gorbachev the czars pushed south into central asia 
and the caucasus and west into the baltics and moldavia in the 18th 
and 19th centuries they brought under their control lands 
bordering other major empires that frequently threatened invasion 
with arrests deportations pogroms discrimination or murder 
the russian czars did little to make the local populations like 
their masters in moscow 
alexander iii introduced russification to make all russian in 
character angering nonrussian peoples his son nicholas ii the 
last czar continued that approach 
soviet founder vladimir i lenin called the russian empire that 
the bolsheviks inherited a prison of nations in 1917 the year 
of the bolshevik revolution peasants angered by the postponement 
of agrarian reform struck out at russian settlers 
in the early years of soviet power under lenin nationalist 
ferment was high in byelorussia the ukraine central asia 
transcaucasia and the baltics the same areas where troubles abound 
now 
many states like the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and 
estonia took lenins policy of national selfdetermination to 
heart and declared their independence 
but stalin followed lenin and took the areas back under kremlin 
control in his effort to rebuild the security ring 
stalin seized the three baltic republics in 1940 
stalin was a georgian but like the czars he tried to russify 
the areas ruled by moscow moldavia for example was regained from 
romania in 1940 and the language was converted from latin to 
cyrillic letters in an attempt to make it seem more russian 
armenians and georgians two christian ethnic groups in the 
caucasus that in the 19th and early 20th centuries sought 
protection of the russian czar against the ottoman empire now are 
among those fighting most vigorously for independence 
after gorbachev took power crimean tatars and armenians led the 
way for other nationalities in voicing their grievances the 
crimean tatars demanded to resettle in the crimean peninsula from 
which they were deported by stalin the armenians wanted to regain 
control over nagornokarabakh a small mountainous territory stalin 
had transferred to azerbaijan in 1923 
the nagornokarabakh dispute has turned out to be the bloodiest 
ethnic feud in recent years and it is the focus of the latest and 
most dangerous flareup 
but that is just the tip of the iceberg in central asia where 
the red army reasserted soviet power after 1917 uzbeks attacked 
meshkhetian turks last june in the fergana valley of uzbekistan 
leaving more than 100 people dead abkhazians clashed with 
georgians who also fought with ossetians 
some experts have estimated there are 40 areas of the soviet 
union where uprooted populations could make territorial claims 
soviet officials worried out loud about a chain reaction or 
domino effect in the campaigns to assert national rights 
calls for independence were heard in the ukraine the 
secondlargest of the 15 republics in september when activists 
there formed the rukh political movement modeled after the 
peoples front organizations that are pressing independence in the 
baltics and elsewhere 
a serious secessionist effort in the ukraine would bring the 
problem much closer to moscow than the unrest in the caucasus or 
the baltics the ukraine is the cradle of russian civilization and 
a contemporary industrial and agricultural powerhouse with 50 
million residents 
gorbachevs position on the soviet republics seems to ethnic 
activists to be at odds with his encouragement of democratic 
reforms in eastern europe 
while promising the 15 republics and autonomous national regions 
within them greater control over their economic cultural and 
political affairs in a newly restructured federation gorbachev has 
consistently ruled out redrawing borders 
he has also emphasized the historical and economic ties linking 
baltic residents uzbeks armenians and azerbaijanis to the soviet 
union 
in a speech in lithuania he made clear the solutions must be 
found in his reform program 
only civil peace the coordination of interests on the basis 
of reciprocity and the active pooling of efforts on the principles 
of perestroika to solve tasks and achieve the objectives of this 
policy can lead the country out of the present difficult 
situation the soviet leader said

reduced eastwest tensions are prompting 
congress to weigh possible cuts in defense as lawmakers resume 
their search for ways to turn back a tide of red ink in the federal 
budget 
also high on the agenda as lawmakers return to capitol hill on 
tuesday are ethics legislation campaign finance reform president 
bushs push to cut the capital gains tax and foreign policy for a 
rapidly changing world 
but crafting a military budget at a time when americans perceive 
a lessening soviet threat and increased need to reduce the deficit 
is expected to dominate the 1990 congressional session 
my constituents ask isnt the berlin wall now a speed 
bump said rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the 
house armed services committee they really are thinking how do 
we get out of debt they just arent buying that we need 
everything 
already a handful of lawmakers including liberal reps barney 
frank dmass and george miller dcalif are talking about how 
to spend the socalled peace dividend that remains 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee says the bush administrations defense plan for the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 will not produce such a dividend 
but sasser said bushs proposal which includes canceling the 
b2 stealth bomber the advanced tactical fighter and the v22 
tiltrotor transport would result in 93 billion in savings from 
19911994 
on jan 29 president bush most likely will submit a package 
totaling about 292 billion which amounts to 2 percent less than 
what is necessary to keep this years 287 billion level at pace 
with inflation 
but with the soviets loosening their grip on eastern europe 
domestic programs clamoring for cash and a nagging budget deficit 
calls are guaranteed to resound in congress for substantial defense 
reductions 
the budget that comes to us in 10 days will undoubtedly be 
cut house armed services chairman les aspin dwis said in a 
speech thursday 
he urged the bush administration to delay production of costly 
hightech weapons such as the stealth advanced tactical fighter and 
concentrate instead on research 
weapons systems that have taken large chunks out of the budget 
in the past such as the strategic defense initiative the b2 
stealth bomber and landbased nuclear missiles will be the focus 
for lawmakers willing to cut defense spending 
the defense budget is being looked upon as the cash register 
regrettably sen john warner rva said 
with defense cuts likely and the entire house and onethird of 
the senate up for reelection support is expected to grow for some 
way to soften the blow for districts dependant on military 
contracts 
legislation introduced in the past by reps ted weiss dny 
nicholas mavroules dmass and sam gejdenson dconn will be 
fodder for a compromise bill the democratic leadership hopes to 
adopt 
on other issues congress tackles the ethics problems of 11 
members including five senators who intervened with banking 
regulators on behalf of the owner of the failed lincoln savings and 
loan charles h keating jr also facing congressional inquiries 
are three house members accused of improper sexual behavior 
clashes with the administration are expected over bushs call 
for a reduction in the capitalgains tax and his rejection of a 
proposed cut in social security taxes 
democrats narrowly defeated the capital gains proposal in 1989 
saying a cut would prove to be a windfall for the rich but many 
concede prospects for passage this year are fairly good 
a rollback in the social security tax proposed by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny is being condemned by bush as a charade 
that would force a hike in other taxes or a cut in retirement 
benefits 
but moynihans plan has put the administration on the spot 
gaining wide support and fueling electionyear claims that bush is 
espousing a capital gains break for the rich while rejecting relief 
for poor and middleclass americans 
the foreign policy debate will center on aid for eastern europe 
and whether to reward the new democracies in the crumbling warsaw 
pact 
a number of regional hotspots also head the foreign policy 
agenda in central america the united states must mend fences with 
nations angered by the us invasion of panama and many lawmakers 
are critical of the administrations overtures to the repressive 
regime in china 
congress this week weighs bushs veto last year of a bill that 
would potentially permit more than 30000 chinese students to 
remain in the united states when their visas expire rather than 
forcing them to return to their homeland 
an override of the veto is possible in the house but its fate 
in the senate is uncertain

at least two companies hired by the energy 
department as independent investigators of environmental and safety 
conditions at nuclear weapons plants are on the payroll at 
facilities they investigated government records show 
others participating in the audits had bid for energy department 
contracts at sites they investigated although they were not yet 
working there still others while not associated with the plants 
they audited are the energy departments prime contractors at 
other nuclear bomb factories 
written department guidelines for carrying out the independent 
tiger team investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding 
organizational conflicts of interest it defines such a conflict as 
a situation in which a contractor has past present or currently 
planned interests that either directly or indirectly may relate 
to the work to be performed and which may bias its judgment 
the tiger teams were assembled by energy secretary james d 
watkins last summer to give an independent view of the plants 
compliance with state and federal environmental safety and health 
standards the auditing work is meant to lay the groundwork for 
actions to correct unsafe and illegal practices at the plants 
virtually all 17 major weapons facilities have severe 
environmental problems estimates of the cost of cleaning up 
production wastes are as high as 100 billion 
watkins publicly stressed the independence of the tiger teams 
but did not explain that many of the experts would be tied to the 
weapons business 
the energy department which owns the plants declined to 
comment on whether the contractors connections to the weapons 
industry amount to a conflict of interest that undermines the 
independence of the investigations or taints the findings 
department spokeswoman catherine kaliniak said the department 
would prefer to use its own employees for this work but we dont 
have the people to do it 
each team is headed by a small number of department officials 
but most of the scientific work is done by contract employees most 
have extensive backgrounds in nuclear environmental and safety 
matters 
a review of department records as well as interviews with 
government and industry officials show that of the eight weapons 
plant investigations done last year at least three involved 
companies that held other energy department contracts at the same 
sites or were bidding for contract work at those facilities 
the engineering and environmental consulting firm nus corp of 
gaithersburg md was on the tiger team that investigated the y12 
uranium processing plant at oak ridge tenn last fall according 
to department records nus at the same time was working for the oak 
ridge reservation on an environmental study of its nuclear and 
hazardous waste management the y12 plant is one of several 
operations at the oak ridge reservation 
nuss oak ridge contract was awarded nov 8 1988 and was 
valued at 14 million the firm also holds contracts at weapons 
facilities in south carolina and idaho 
nus spokesman don couchman declined to discuss any aspect of the 
firms work for the energy department

helped evaluate the nevada test site which conducts underground 
nuclear weapons tests the company at the same time was working at 
the site under two energy department contracts with a combined 
value of 100 million most of its work is at a proposed highlevel 
nuclear waste dump at the site that was not part of the tiger team 
audit 
icf kaiser engineers an engineering and construction company 
based in oakland calif participated in tiger team audits at the 
nevada test site 
icf held no energy department contracts at the test site at the 
time of the investigation last november but it was bidding for a 
5 million job to help the facilitys prime contractor reynolds 
electrical amp engineering co inc develop and carry out an 
environmental cleanup program there icf kaiser announced it won 
the contract 10 days after the onsite tiger team work ended dec 1 
similarly records show the company participated in tiger team 
investigations at the fernald uranium processing plant in ohio and 
the y12 oak ridge plant while it was a bidder for major energy 
department contracts at both sites the contract at oak ridge is 
valued at 505 million over five years according to bob lynch 
deputy director of the departments field office there 
marc tipermas executive vice president of icf said in a 
telephone interview that he saw no conflict of interest in his 
companys involvement in the tiger team work he said he was not 
sure whether in choosing icf for the work the department knew or 
cared about the companys other work at the weapons plants 
in order to get this job done well and quickly contractors 
had to be used tipermas said like many other companies we 
were drafted we were helterskelter pulled onto these teams 
the energy department has used private contractors to run the 
nuclear weapons plants since they were built as part of the world 
war ii manhattan project that produced the atomic bombs dropped on 
japan in 1945 the contracting system has left the department with 
little internal expertise in this area and a tendency to rely on 
the weapons makers to police themselves 
watkins strongly advocates hiring more federal employees with 
environmental safety and health expertise to lessen the dependence 
on private contractors 
although the department insists that the tiger team members 
links to the weapons industry do not compromise their objectivity 
as judges of environmental and safety conditions at the plants 
some outside experts disagree 
its inevitably a potential conflict when a contractor is 
reviewing another contractor and the reason is that any possible 
criticism of one contractor might lead to future business for 
another contractor said donald f kettl a political science 
professor at vanderbilt university and author of a book on 
government use of contractors 
other tiger team members included companies in charge of running 
nuclear weapons plants though not the ones they investigated 
these include egampg inc which is the prime contractor at the rocky 
flats plutonium processing plant near denver the idaho national 
engineering laboratory at idaho falls which processes naval 
nuclear fuels and the mound laboratory near dayton ohio which 
makes detonators for nuclear arms 
martin marietta energy systems inc which runs the oak ridge 
facilities participated in some other audits as did subsidiaries 
of westinghouse electric corp which runs several weapons sites 
and mason and hangar silas mason co operator of the pantex final 
weapons assembly plant near amarillo texas

the united states will no longer oppose 
britains decision to forcibly send back refugees from hong kong to 
vietnam officials say 
in exchange the united states is demanding that britain stop 
the involuntary repatriation of the refugees for one year during 
that time relief workers will try to convince the boat people 
it is safe for them to go back to vietnam said the officials 
the revised us position will be presented at an 18nation 
meeting tuesday in geneva where a solution will be sought to the 
growing number of vietnamese stranded in hong kong thailand and 
other southeast asian countries 
britain has indicated it will reject the yearlong moratorium 
but a compromise possibly of six months is expected to emerge 
at the twoday meeting the officials said 
the american decision adopted after months of agonizing 
deliberations will anger a strong lobby of asian americans and 
members of congress opposed to any forced repatriation 
there isnt a good solution to this said one official 
speaking on condition of anonymity its simply the lesser of 
evils 
for months the united states rejected any involuntary 
repatriation to vietnam citing the countrys repressive stalinist 
government and extreme poverty but the problem has grown 
increasingly acute with a sharp increase of refugees fleeing 
vietnam in rickety boats since last spring 
more than 60000 left vietnam last year the highest number 
since 1981 bringing to about 120000 the number of boat people in 
those socalled first asylum countries in southeast asia a 
majority are in hong kong and the rest in the philippines 
malaysia and thailand a small number reached singapore and japan 
under a plan adopted in geneva by the 18 nations last june 
46000 of the boat people will be resettled in the west over the 
next 3 years about half in the united states 
those who return to vietnam receive 650 from the un high 
commissioner for refugees and a guarantee against reprisal or 
persecution 
the british citing cramped conditions for refugees on the 
already crowded island of hong kong decreed that all boat people 
who sailed to the colony after june 1988 were illegal immigrants 
unless able to prove they fled persecution rather than economic 
hardships 
the british also sought approval from the international 
community for sending back vietnamese even if they refused to go 
and forcibly sent back 51 refugees from hong kong last month 
the united states found itself increasingly isolated among the 
18 nations of the geneva agreement with only vietnam and the 
soviets on its side 
we feel we must make some accommodation with the british 
said the same official not that we like it but were afraid if 
we dont well lose even the first asylum countries such as hong 
kong malaysia thailand and the philippines 
fearful of being saddled with thousands of vietnamese refugees 
who are ineligible for resettlement elsewhere malaysia has pushed 
away 60 boatloads of vietnamese said the official there have been 
several cases of thailand doing so as well 
were going to demand iron clad guarantees that the 
international community shoulder the burden of repatriating the 
vietnamese and that the un high commissioner can monitor against 
persecution he said 
so far about 900 vietnamese have gone back voluntarily but the 
united states believes that with the right counseling more can be 
persuaded to return the official said 
they basically have to understand that they will receive 
financial help that the un will make sure theyre not 
persecuted and that their only other choice is to rot in camps 
in other countries he said 
the united states will ask japan australia and britain to 
contribute heavily to the repatriation fund he said 
the united states has taken in 900000 of the 15 million who 
fled vietnam since the war ended in 1975

when members of the atlanta police bomb squad 
were called last month to the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
they quickly realized they were dealing with someone whose only 
interest was murder 
we knew we had a federal judge in alabama that had been killed 
by one that blew up recalled sgt william h briley bomb squad 
supervisor we knew we had an intact item here that was 
definitely deadly but if we could disrupt it we might gain some 
valuable information 
i thought that was important enough to stick my neck out on a 
limb 
he took the bomb to a police shooting range and dismantled it 
investigators believe the bomb briley dismantled dec 18 is 
related to ones that killed judge robert vance of the 11th circuit 
in suburban birmingham ala and savannah attorney robert 
robinson plus another bomb sent to the jacksonville fla office 
of the naacp at about the same time 
a letter to an atlanta television station said a group called 
americans for a competent federal judiciary system sent the 
bombs to protest what it called preferential treatment of black 
suspects no arrests have been made 
briley would not discuss the contents of the bomb except to say 
it was a powerful one but he said handling it or any other bomb 
is a test of wits pitting the officer against the bomb builder 
nothing is absolute the building of a bomb is limited only by 
the imagination and ability of the builder said briley you 
realize some day someone is going to build one you cant figure 
out 
in the month since the bombings the atlanta bomb squad has 
handled more than 100 suspicious packages but found no more 
explosives 
each call is handled as if the package were a bomb portable 
xray equipment is used to try to determine whats inside then the 
decision is made whether the package is safe whether to move it 
detonate it or dismantle it 
after that its up to the skill of the individual bomb 
technician 
if you mess up youve done just exactly what he wanted you to 
do and you might lose your life real easy briley said we try 
to do this according to procedures but theres no way you can 
guarantee you wont be killed 
briley has been with the bomb squad a small unit within the 
city police special weapons and tactics unit since it was founded 
12 years ago its members have passed a fourweek course in 
explosives handling given by the us army at redstone arsenal in 
huntsville ala 
the squads equipment includes xray machines a bombhandling 
container an armored trailer for transporting explosives and 
armored suits that provide some protection in case of explosion 
but if youre right over it nothing is going to help 
while the courthouse episode received a lot of publicity many 
lesser known operations are just as dangerous briley said there 
were cases in california of people being killed disposing of 
fireworks and discarded dynamite is particularly dangerous because 
it becomes more unstable as it deteriorates 
briley says he couldnt think of any place i wouldnt rather 
have been that dec 18 but describes the intensity of feeling 
that goes through a squad member after a successful mission 
the relief with something like this is something you cant 
feel the blood is flowing through your body at such a rate it 
doesnt automatically slow down he said you can feel it in 
your movements

government forces on saturday ousted 
a provincial governor suspected of backing the december coup 
attempt forcing his supporters from the local capitol building 
with tear gas and clubs a radio report said 
the action was widely seen as a barometer of the resolve of 
president corazon aquino to punish participants in coup attempts 
the independent radio station dzrh said local government 
secretary luis santos ordered troops to disperse about 10000 
supporters of rodolfo aguinaldo governor of cagayan province in 
northern luzon island the forces were flown in from manila about 
200 miles to the south 
for several days scores of aguinaldos youthful supporters 
prevented santos and vice gov melvin vargas from entering the 
capitol building at tuguegarao 
i will not allow the dignity of this office to get trampled 
upon by your governor santos said of the defiant supporters he 
said we will clear them up 
the supreme court upheld a government decision to suspend 
aguinaldo on jan 6 because he allegedly threatened to send troops 
and tanks to manila last month to support the bid to oust mrs 
aquino 
dzrh said the government forces saturday fired several rounds of 
teargas canisters and units armed with truncheons and shields 
pushed back the crowd to allow santos vargas and military 
officials to enter the provincial capitol 
santos swore in vargas as acting governor after aguinaldo was 
seized aguinaldo was ordered suspended 60 days while authorities 
investigate his alleged role in the dec 19 coup attempt the 
radio station said 
on thursday defense secretary fidel ramos claimed aguinaldo 
agreed to vacate his office at midday friday but aguinaldo later 
denied that report 
in addition to the latest accusations aguinaldo was implicated 
but never charged in an august 1987 coup attempt afterward he 
resigned from the military and raised his own private army 
ostensibly to fight communist rebels 
he was elected governor of cagayan by a landslide in january 
1988

soviet troops stormed the azerbaijani capital 
today punched through barricades erected by militants and 
reportedly killed dozens of people in an attempt to end ethnic 
violence and territorial disputes in the region 
the street is covered with blood vadim korsh an editor of 
azerbaijans official news agency azerinform said of the scene of 
one of the biggest clashes the military garrison in the capital 
baku 
corpses were strewn on the road to bakus airport he said in a 
telephone interview from the southern soviet city of 18 million 
the government declared a state of emergency in baku which was 
reported to be paralyzed and heavily patrolled by troops with tanks 
authorities say armenian and azerbaijani warriors are armed 
with stolen helicopters tanks and even groundtoground missiles 
the government on friday suspended the defense ministrys callup 
of reservists to beef up military units in the face of widespread 
public protest 
reports of the number of deaths conflicted korsh said the 
office of bakus mayor reported the death toll was 60 alexander a 
bessmertnykh first deputy soviet foreign minister said eight 
soldiers and more than 40 people who attacked the troops were 
killed he told a briefing in moscow his information came from 
azerbaijans interior ministry which oversees the republics 
police 
activists spoke of much higher death tolls 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev discussed the crisis in a 
nationally televised address tonight in which he said the crackdown 
was necessary because two years of trying to solve the ethnic 
conflict peacefully had failed 
militants were forming their own bands of warriors arming them 
and killing people gorbachev said this had to stop he said 
azerinform reported hundreds of wounded but no exact figure was 
available from the agency or other sources 
if the death toll of 60 is confirmed the toll in the caucasus 
violence that began a week ago would be more than 140 people killed 
and more than 220 wounded western reporters have been banned from 
the region 
gorbachev has repeatedly warned that the violence between 
azerbaijanis and armenians which has deep historical roots could 
cause a national tragedy by igniting other territorial disputes and 
proindependence movements that could jeopardize his program of 
economic and political reforms 
todays violence and confusion were further complicated by more 
daring and unexpected political moves by azerbaijanis 
the legislature of the nakhichevan autonomous republic voted to 
secede from azerbaijan as well as from the ussr the interior 
ministry in moscow and irans official news agency reported 
nakhichevan is a small azerbaijani enclave of a quartermillion 
people surrounded by armenian iranian and turkish territory it 
has been under azerbaijans jurisdiction since 1924 
asked about the decision bessmertnykh told reporters it was 
unprecedented and condemned it as an illegal act violating the 
soviet constitution which requires the consent of the host 
republic for autonomous districts to secede 
irans official news agency said the nakhichevans supreme 
soviet demanded that soviet troops leave the enclave and called on 
turkey iran and the united nations to help safeguard its 
territorial integrity and prevent a massacre 
territorial disputes are at the heart of the unrest that is 
sweeping azerbaijan and the neighboring republic of armenia 
armenians launched a campaign two years ago to wrest control of the 
district of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan on jan 13 
azerbaijanis staged antiarmenian riots in baku and fighting 
between both ethnic groups spread throughout the region 
azerbaijanis are predominantly moslem and armenians are mostly 
christian 
troops were reported to have moved into baku a caspian sea port 
city early today official media said military units entered baku 
were fired on by militants of the azerbaijans popular front a 
group that has organized antiarmenian protests and were forced 
to retaliate 
the rebels reportedly blocked roads with buses trucks and cars 
in an effort to prevent troop movements 
nazim ragimov an unofficial journalist said he saw 12 corpses 
and that battles continued overnight korsh said shots were ringing 
out and tanks and armored personnel carriers patrolled during the 
day a radio moscow correspondent reported from baku that cordons 
of soldiers were massed in the capitals main square and that they 
wore flak jackets and helmets 
activists said tens of thousands of people poured into the 
square outside the communist party headquarters this afternoon to 
demand that the republics legislature meet in emergency session to 
demand the resignation of party chief abdulrakhman vezirov and the 
lifting of the state of emergency 
gorbachev signed a decree today extending to baku a state of 
emergency imposed earlier in the week in other strifetorn parts of 
the caucasus 
radio moscow said the action by the governments highest 
executive body followed attempts by criminal extremist forces 
through violence and mass disturbances to depose the legally 
functioning state bodies 
the broadcast said the measure forbids strikes and street 
processions the use of duplicating equipment and the use of 
transport without special permission bessmertnykh told reporters 
the measures and introduction of troops had improved the situation 
things are better than they were before troops were introduced 
he said 
but the reports of mass rallies and the continued sound of 
gunshots ringing out in the capital indicated otherwise 
soviet army and internal security troops have been building up 
in armenia and azerbaijan for several days but they had not 
entered baku until today 
leila unusova a spokeswoman for an organization calling itself 
the azerbaijani social democrat group reported by telephone from 
baku that soviet troops had surrounded the square near the 
communist party headquarters where 30000 azerbaijanis had gathered 
in an antigovernment protest she said the forces included armored 
personnel carriers water cannons and other military equipment but 
she did not know whether soldiers there had opened fire 
our citizens blockaded roads on the south and north with cars 
and buses she said young people 20 to 25 years old were 
there manning the barricades korsh said tanks and armored 
personnel carriers plowed through the barricades running over 
anyone in their way 
shortly after midnight friday ms unusova said soviet army 
troops entered the city from the north and from a base inside the 
baku military academy and opened fire on the militants positions 
the biggest battles reportedly raged around the airport and 
military garrison where armed protesters had been trying to 
prevent troop reinforcements from traveling to the strifetorn 
areas 
wounded were being taken to three hospitals in the city ms 
unusova said 
its very dangerous on the street ms unusova said four 
hours after the shooting started battles are still going on

president bush gets a higher approval rating 
in polls than ronald reagan did eight years ago though only one in 
five americans realizes it a group that studies public awareness 
of the news said saturday 
that perception may prove to be as important to the president 
as his actual standing in the opinion polls said andrew kohut 
director of surveys for times mirror center for people and the 
press 
times mirror said its latest survey conducted just after 
panamanian dictator manuel noriega surrendered to american 
authorities showed 81 percent approval of the way bush is handling 
his job after a year in office 
this compares with 49 percent for reagan in january 1982 when 
the country was slipping into a recession from which it later 
recovered 
the latest washington postabc news poll also conducted after 
the us invasion of panama gave bush an approval rating of 79 
percent six points higher than what reagan ever achieved as 
president 
only one person in five however had the impression that bush 
is more popular than reagan was at the corresponding point in his 
first term 
if fifty years of history tell us anything bushs approval 
ratings are likely to fall well below their current mark kohut 
said the question for bush watchers is whether the presidents 
quiet popularity at what may be the peak of his approval ratings 
can cushion him during the trough in his ratings 
in washington politics perceptions of popularity count a 
lot he said a serious decline in the approval rating of a 
popular president who is not perceived as popular might prove 
more costly than it did for a leader like reagan whose perceived 
public esteem was often ahead of his actual scores 
forty percent of the people surveyed by times mirror said they 
thought bush was less popular than reagan compared with 20 percent 
who said he was more popular another 36 percent said the two were 
about equally popular 
to some extent this disparity between perception and reality 
may be explained by the difference in intensity of public feelings 
toward the two leaders kohut said but so far those 
differences tend to be relatively small 
over the course of the reagan presidency about half of those 
who approved of the president did so strongly the times mirror 
official said in the washington postabc poll about one out of 
three persons in the sample strongly approved of bushs job 
performance the highest level of strong support for him since he 
took office 
a gallup poll earlier this month showed bush with an 80 percent 
approval rating higher than that for any other president at the 
same point in his first term since world war ii

the consumption of alcohol shot up 
more than 20 percent in iceland last year after the nation lifted a 
73year ban on the sale of strong beer a study indicates 
figures released friday by the state alcohol monopoly show that 
icelanders over the age of 15 consumed an average of 97 pints of 
pure alcohol in beer spirits and other drinks in 1989 compared 
with 788 pints the year before 
the organization said the 229 percent rise in consumption was 
largely due to the legalization march 1 1989 of beer with more 
than 225 percent alcohol 
the move was greeted with many parties bar openings and offers 
of free drinks and by dire predictions that public drunkeness 
would increase 
before that icelanders could drink spirits wine and 
lowalcohol beer but could not legally buy strong beer except at 
airport dutyfree stores

four white supremacists demonstrated near the 
gravesite of the rev martin luther king jr today as more than 
2500 police and national guard troops kept counterdemonstrators a 
distance 
the mississippibased leader of the nationalist movement 
richard barrett was accompanied by three supporters as he read 
statements reviling king at the king national historic site across 
the street from the civil rights leaders tomb 
that grave is not a throne that corpse is not a king we are 
here to bury a tyranny barrett said his group left with a 
police escort less than an hour later to jeers from about 75 
mostly young and racially mixed counterdemonstrators who gathered 
in fog and drizzle 
plans for what president bush denounced friday as a rally of 
hate caused the adjacent martin luther king jr center for 
nonviolent social change to close for the day 
civil rights activist hosea williams who had planned to gather 
supporters at kings tomb settled for briefly parking two busloads 
of people near the police lines and then headed north to virtually 
allwhite forsyth county where barrett planned to march later 
around noon about 60 supporters of williams a former king aide 
and atlanta city councilman were marching toward cumming about an 
hour ride from atlanta some onlookers greeted the civil rights 
supporters with confederate battle flags 
some of the atlanta counterdemonstrators who took to the 
streets against the wishes of civil rights groups used bullhorns 
to criticize police for protecting the white supremacists the 
counterdemonstrators including members of the revolutionary 
communist youth brigade could get no closer than 200 yards to 
barrett 
atlanta police said there were two arrests one for disorderly 
conduct and one for public drunkenness in the vicinity of the 
rally 
many americans regard kings tomb and the surrounding blocks 
where he grew up and preached as a sacred place said randolph 
scott director of the king federal historic site 
we feel the same way scott said but he barrett does 
have the right to protest like any other group we would have 
hoped he would have selected some other site but we couldnt 
deny him 
president bush in atlanta on friday at a homebuilders 
convention denounced the barrett protest 
atlanta is a great cheerful city that has proudly risen from 
the ashes of a distant past bush said and so for those who 
plan to revel in a rally of hate here tomorrow let them know this 
atlantans like all americans turn their backs on bigots 
the security surrounding todays events was nothing new more 
than 2400 police national guards troops and other law enforcement 
officers were called out to seal off the state capitol area two 
weeks ago for a rally by a ku klux klan group 
the estimated total cost of the security was 500000 and the 
governor said this week he was very troubled by the burden such 
demonstrations were placing on georgia taxpayers 
forsyth county a virtually allwhite rural and suburban area 
north of atlanta is the site where williams and a group of 
brotherhood marchers in january 1987 were pelted with rocks by 
a jeering crowd 
after publicity over the violence williams returned the next 
week with 20000 supporters in one of the largest civil rights 
marches in the united states since the 1960s peak of the movement 
in january 1988 barrett and a small group of demonstrators were 
pelted with rocks bricks and cement during a protest march through 
downtown atlanta

with their american backers role now in 
question solidarity leaders wonder if anything can save the 
roughandtumble shipyard where eastern europes revolution began a 
decade ago 
in spite of a rare sunny stretch for selling ships the 
centuryold gdansk shipyard faces collapse a victim of the system 
its workers sought to change and the upheaval they unleashed 
what happens next reflected zbigniew lis the unions 
delegate at the yard echoing a reporters question thats what 
wed like to know this is an hourglass and the last grains are 
dropping 
negotiations suddenly cooled with barbara piasecka johnson the 
polishborn heiress who last may said she would spend up to 100 
million to take the enterprise out of the red 
she emerged with lech walesa from a church in gdansk and pledged 
to buy a 55 percent interest 
walesa in an interview last week eluded questions on what went 
wrong but lis made no effort to mask bitterness at a proposal 
which he said turns her generous offer into a trojan horse 
an aide to mrs johnson said she still wanted to invest in the 
shipyard despite reports the deal had unraveled 
mrs johnson is still very interested and enthusiastic about 
the shipyard john peach her assistant said by telephone from 
princeton nj he said the group of advisers mrs johnson 
assembled to work on the deal remains intact we plan to be over 
there as soon as the government says come on over 
according to solidarity and shipyard officials mrs johnson 
wanted a guarantee that there would be no strikes for five years 
along with a fiveyear wage contract of 50 cents an hour 
zbigniew lis a solidarity representative was quoted in the 
youth daily sztandar mlodych on jan 8 as saying other joint 
ventures pay about 1 to 150 per hour 
also they said mrs johnson wanted to halve the work force to 
about 3700 men limiting production to 10 ships a year a third of 
capacity 
we are not interested in running at our lowest level in 45 
years said hans szye operations director we want to build it 
up in 29 years in this business ive never seen a better world 
market 
experts agree many european shipbuilders closed down in recent 
years faced with asian competition and aging vessels must be 
replaced specialized ships are in growing demand 
but ships take two to three years to build and credit is 
essential polish banks charge 58 percent a month interest szye 
said and foreign banks recoil in fear 
in october 1988 communist authorities said they would close the 
yard for economic reasons throwing its already troubled affairs 
into turmoil violent reaction helped to topple the government 
more recently a solidaritybased government decided to offer 
the company to shareholders as soon as enabling laws are passed

the space shuttle columbia 
landed in darkness today with a rescued satellite aboard after 
overcoming weather and computer problems that extended the mission 
to a record of nearly 11 days 
the shuttle touched down about 135 am pst and rolled to a 
stop showing no apparent problem from its heavy cargo which gave 
columbia a landing weight of 228400 pounds more than 8000 pounds 
heavier than the previous shuttle record 
roger columbia welcome home an outstanding job said mike 
baker capsule communicator you showed us the shuttle at its 
best at deploying and retrieving satellites 
great way to start the decade he said 
before retrieving the scientific satellite columbias crew 
deployed a navy communications satellite 
despite columbias record weight it was a beautiful 
landing with the nose gear touching down gently and no sign of 
brake damage on initial inspection said william b lenoir nasas 
associate administrator for space flight 
a closer but still preliminary inspection later found that the 
brakes heated up more than expected because of columbias heavy 
load and an orbital maneuvering system may need repair said 
shuttle processing manager larry ellis 
the examination also found that the shuttles heatshield tiles 
sustained eight dings larger than one inch and 85 smaller than 
that he said another tile may need to be replaced but the 
overall tile damage rate is a little below average ellis said 
adding that columbia is in excellent condition 
the spacecraft approached edwards unseen to the human eye but 
revealed itself with a whooshing noise then suddenly appeared out 
of the dark like a ghost backlit by powerful searchlights 
illuminating the runway 
the shuttles trademark twin sonic booms woke residents on the 
coast in malibu as the orbiter streaked toward its desert landing 
site about two dozen people called malibu police 
some thought it was an earthquake others said someone was 
trying to break in or was on the roof said los angeles county 
sheriffs deputy sheila smith 
shuttle commander daniel brandenstein pilot james wetherbee and 
mission specialists bonnie dunbar marsha ivins and g david low 
left the shuttle 2 hours 5 minutes after landing 
nasa astronauts usually disembark from shuttles about an hour 
after landing it took them longer this time because they underwent 
extended onboard medical exams and took longer to readjust to 
gravity after the recordlong flight lenoir said eventually 
missions of up to 16 days are planned 
it looked like all five crewmen were quite healthy he said 
during a news conference 
weve been spending time with the docs doing a lot of grunts 
and groans brandenstein said before he and his crew boarded two 
jets to to johnson space center in houston eight hours after 
columbia landed 
the shuttles return already delayed a day by poor weather 
columbia was to have landed at 1201 am today until a problem 
occurred in a computer that served as a backup to four primary 
computers aboard the orbiter 
mission controllers canceled an 11 pm pst friday deorbit burn 
and instead fired the rockets 90 minutes later 
the new touchdown time extended the mission to 10 days and 21 
hours more than half a day longer than the previous shuttle 
duration mark 
the faulty computer was taken out of service and its duties as 
backup were reassigned to one of the other four computers leaving 
three primary computers 
about 2000 people came to see the landing although nasa warned 
that darkness would conceal columbia until moments before it 
touched down on a concrete runway illuminated by six 800 million 
candlepower searchlights 
the paved strip was preferred to the recently rainsoaked clay 
runways on the expansive bed of rogers dry lake 
the shuttle carried the 11ton long duration exposure facility 
an experimentladen satellite placed in orbit in april 1984 and 
originally scheduled to be retrieved by a shuttle 10 months later 
subsequent delays and the loss of the shuttle challenger in 1986 
stranded the ldef for nearly six years and a decaying orbit 
threatened to pull it to a fiery end in march until columbias 
robot arm snared and stowed it aboard 
among the 57 experiments carried by the ldef were 125 million 
tomato seeds to be distributed to schools for study of longterm 
space effects on growth 
the structure of ldef itself is expected to yield valuable 
information about space effects on materials which will help in 
designing a permanent space station 
the 12sided 30footlong ldef will remain in the cargo bay 
until the shuttle arrives back at kennedy space center in florida 
the twoday ferry flight atop a jumbo jet is scheduled to begin in 
about six days 
columbia was launched jan 9 and the crew successfully deployed 
a navy communications satellite and performed a variety of 
scientific and medical experiments in addition to capturing the 
ldef 
the shuttle originally was to land at 255 am friday however 
patchy fog at the mojave desert landing site pushed back the 
landing a day and lengthened the mission to a record 
columbia set the old duration record of 10 days seven hours 47 
minutes and 24 seconds in late 1983 that flight carried the 
spacelab1 module which gave the orbiter the old landing weight 
record of 220000 pounds

the outgoing leader of yugoslavias 
ruling communist party told delegates to a key congress saturday 
that the old model of oneparty rule had failed and he urged them 
to support free elections 
yugoslavia must embrace marketoriented economic reform free 
expression and political pluralism party president milan pancevski 
said adding that oneparty socialism had objectively exhausted 
its possibilities for development 
hardliners won the first round in the fourday meeting 
blocking a quick vote on a document that backs free elections and 
formation of independent political parties and expresses a 
willingness to surrender the communists 45year monopoly on power 
the debate indicated a deep split within the party between those 
backing rapid political change in conjunction with economic reforms 
already under way and those reluctant to fully relinquish the 
communists hold on power 
several delegates from the liberal northern republic of slovenia 
urged that the document be adopted as it stands as one of the first 
points of the agenda apparently to show the partys commitment to 
reform 
but hardliners mostly from the largest republic of serbia 
wanted it to be discussed in committee and adopted with other 
documents at the end of the congress leading to speculation it 
could be watered down 
the hardliners successfully blocked a motion calling for an 
immediate vote although 780 delegates favored a quick vote and 645 
opposed it the measure failed to win the needed twothirds 
majority 
stefan koresec who presided over the morning plenary said the 
draft document would be discussed in committee and adopted at the 
conclusion of the congress with other resolutions 
the debate was indicative of a deep split within the yugoslav 
communist party over the issue of a multiparty system said joze 
smole president of slovenias communistdominated mass 
organization socialist alliance 
he told the associated press that slovenian communists want to 
see the declaration be even more explicit on the party 
relinquishing power while the serbs consider the party should 
retain a dominant role 
serbian delegate slobodan jovanovic said delegates needed more 
time to discuss the document because they had been unable to review 
it in advance 
the declaration published last week in the media admits that 
the oneparty system of monopoly has pushed us into autocracy and 
prevented us from keeping up with the economic technological 
political and social changes in europe and the world 
the government friday announced plans to submit to parliament 
constitutional amendments that would formally scrap the partys 
guaranteed leading role in society as well as draft legislation 
setting forth the legal groundwork for multiparty elections 
in his opening address to the congress pancevski said 
yugoslavia must enact democratic reforms and reform its economy 
this also means the definite abandonment of the singleparty 
view of political relations through the affirmation of new 
democratic reforms we must ensure the freedom from any 
monopolies on power pancevski said according to an advance text 
carried by the national news agency tanjug a new party chief is to 
be elected at the congress 
the building of a system that will constantly increase 
human rights and freedoms that will strengthen democracy and that 
will ensure the free expression of political pluralism and an 
efficient state based on the rule of law are imperative to the 
countrys development he added 
the congress which will also elect a new leadership was called 
four months early in the wake of yugoslavias growing political and 
economic crisis the ruling party embroiled in internal clashes 
over how far to go in implementing reform has stalled on making 
changes deemed necessary to overcome the countrys problems 
with spiraling inflation currently at an annual rate of 1500 
percent a 17 billion foreign debt dropping living standards and 
growing unemployment traditional ethnic rivalries have resurfaced 
in recent years and added to internal tensions 
nonaligned yugoslavia once considered the most liberal of the 
communist countries in europe has lagged behind some warsaw pact 
countries in recent months on political reform 
no foreign delegations were invited to the congress because 
delegates wanted the meeting to have a working character 
delegates made another break with tradition when they sang the 
national anthem at the start of the congress instead of the 
communist anthem the internationale

royal jordanian airline flights in response to demands by islamic 
activists in parliament 
islamic fundamentalists won more than 30 of the 80 parliamentary 
seats in novembers election and the koran islams holy book 
forbids liquor consumption 
prime minister mudar badran said no liquor would be sold on 
flights to arab and islamic countries by royal jordanian the

the us army claims its 
disciplined fire during the invasion of panama kept civilian 
deaths to a minimum but the nations top medical examiner said the 
toll was at least 202 and some say it was far higher 
we have no evidence to say there are thousands but we know 
they are not 200 said carmen miro a university professor and 
member of a church group 
some church groups said the number of panamanian dead could be 
as high as 1000 and former us attorney general ramsey clark 
suggested it could run as high as 7000 though there is little 
evidence to support the higher figures 
we have asked our people throughout the country to make a 
survey we think it is closer to 1000 civilian and military but 
nobody knows said mario rognoni a leader of the political 
opposition to the new government of president guillermo endara 
the panama defense forces suffered 314 dead as a result of the 
dec 20 invasion 23 us troops died along with three american 
civilians 
clark said his figure of anywhere from 4000 to 7000 but most 
likely 2000 had come from people he met during the two days he 
spent here early in january and not from his own investigation 
roger montero director of the national office of forensic 
medicine said the civilian death toll nationwide came to 202 
most of the higher estimates were based on the destruction of 
the crowded neighborhood of el chorrillo which is next to the 
defense headquarters building the main target of the us army 
fire the night of the invasion 
el chorrillo a neighborhood of two and threestory old wooden 
buildings that was home to more than 20000 people burned to the 
ground during the fire that broke out after the fighting began 
however accounts from the night of the invasion indicate that 
many residents had fled el chorrillo soon after the invasion began 
and escaped the destruction so the death toll there was not as 
high as originally feared 
most artillery and tank fire was directed at the threestory 
defense forces headquarters sheridan tanks fired from fort amador 
several hundred yards away across an arm of panama bay and from a 
hill at quarry heights also only a few hundred yards away 
we had enough time to rehearse this was an extremely 
wellexecuted operation said lt gen carl stiner in an 
interview he said the coordinated attacks had been organized to 
avoid loss of civilian life 
for months before the invasion us forces arguing that the 
panama canal treaties allow them to move freely on panamanian 
roads engaged in almost daily maneuvers that included mock 
takeovers of towns and installations around panama 
in addition to el chorrillo civilian deaths also occurred near 
the airport in the san miguelito neighborhood where paramilitary 
groups fought us forces for several days and at rio hato a 
panamanian military base about 60 miles to the southwest 
there was practically no shooting involving civilians in 
crossfire throughout the rest of the country according to us 
military sources 
catholic priests at an el chorrillo church told the associated 
press they estimate that about 20 people died in el chorrillo many 
in a fire that was set by retreating paramilitary supporters of 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
nearly 10000 people sought refuge in the church and the 
school and old folks home next to it said the rev jose castano 
the rev javier arteta added that members of the paramilitary 
dignity battalions came out of their homes shooting in every 
direction they wounded a 6yearold boy they did not know what to 
do 
the us soldiers never fired in the direction of the 
church arteta said 
it was a night of terror said maria salgado who lost her 
home in the battle and ensuing fire we did not know what was 
happening 
arteta said that about an hour before the attacks people heard 
explosions in the direction of fort amador about a mile away and 
many fled their homes 
throughout the morning americans used loudspeakers to warn 
people to stay away from the area arteta said 
the americans did not care about the dead arteta added 
three days later we had to set fire to six bodies 
the civilian dead at el chorrillo were taken to the nearest 
panamanian hospital santo tomas dr leonardo diaz told 
journalists the first two days that there were never more than 100 
bodies in the morgue 
in colon 50 miles northwest of panama city there were reports 
of at least 20 civilian dead 
in the days following the invasion there were also reports of 
some dead in isolated encounters with us patrols

sen daniel patrick moynihans proposal to cut 
the social security payroll tax already has republicans running 
scared but the new yorkers fellow democrats arent exactly 
enchanted either 
with the white house opposing moynihan the bush administration 
finds itself opposing a tax cut an unusual position for the 
president who made the phrase no new taxes famous but 
democrats are wary of the budgetary repercussions of moynihans 
idea 
some top democrats trying to not sound harshly critical have 
already publicly raised questions about moynihans idea the 
support of other top congressional democrats is conspicuous by its 
absence 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif calls 
the proposal very attractive but adds i dont think we 
ought to add that loss of revenues to the deficit 
the chairman of the senate budget committee james sasser 
dtenn has taken open delight at republican squirming over 
moynihans idea but warns we cant look at it in isolation from 
our fiscal condition and unless we offset the cut our deficit 
problem will get even worse 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the plan 
an important proposal on friday but stopped short of endorsing 
it he said he would withhold a decision on whether to support the 
plan until he receives studies from his aides on how it would 
effect the federal budget shortfall 
not heard from at all have been three other major players in any 
revenue legislation house speaker thomas s foley dwash house 
ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill and 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
i havent seen any bandwagon on the moynihan thing senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan said friday 
moynihan considered one of the senates experts on social 
security has said his plan is aimed at preventing the growing 
surpluses the system generates from artificially lowering the 
federal deficit the social security system pocketed 50 billion 
more last year than it paid out allowing the governments books to 
show a 152 billion shortfall rather than one reaching 202 
billion 
the new yorkers proposal also gives the democrats a tax slash 
that helps lower and middleclass americans most of all since the 
payroll tax does not apply at all to earnings above 51300 
moynihans plan stands in stark contrast to bushs coveted 
reduction in the capital gains levy rate a cut that studies show 
will be of most benefit to the wealthiest americans 
the cut would add 7 billion to this years already formidable 
budget deficit and 55 billion more to the gap in fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 thats 62 billion more in just two years in 
spending cuts borrowing or increases in other federal taxes that 
the government would be forced into to compensate for the payroll 
cut 
even out of a 12 trillion budget the amount of savings to be 
found is huge to provide quick perspective lawmakers will have to 
find about 35 billion in savings this year for the 1991 budget 
and partisan battles over that amount will probably last until 
congress adjourns in the fall 
so far just two democrats have announced support for moynihans 
measure which he plans to introduce tuesday the day lawmakers 
return from their winter recess 
sen claiborne pell dri said he would cosponsor the bill 
saying continued use of social security funds to hide the full size 
of the federal deficit are a gigantic although unintended fraud 
on the working people of this country 
rep byron dorgan dnd said he would introduce a companion 
bill in the house calling it the only way to force an addressing 
of the key issue of the deficit 
the proposal cant be ignored since he announced the plan on 
dec 29 the middle of the winter recess it has attracted 
mounting attention by the day it now looms as one of the major 
budget issues facing returning lawmakers 
what can we do mused one democratic aide if we walk away 
from it now someone else will pick it up 
moynihan would cut the 765 percent payroll tax paid 
separately by workers and their employers by 014 percent 
immediately and by 096 percent more next january the levy would 
begin to rise again in the year 2015 so the social security system 
could begin building up a reserve to pay for the 75 million baby 
boomers who will begin to retire at around that time

thousands of followers of bhagwan shree 
rajneesh the guru of free love flocked to his commune saturday a 
day after his death to celebrated what they consider the release of 
the rajneeshs spirit 
rajneesh 58 died at his commune in the city of poona on 
friday the official cause of death was heart failure but a 
statement released by the commune said he died because living in 
the body had become a hell after the rajneeshs alleged poisoning 
in us jails 
commune spokesman swami chaitanya kirti said at least 15000 
followers visited the center saturday and chanted mantras 
meditated and danced 
they celebrated they came to hear oshos last words kirti 
said in a telephone interview 
since 1988 rajneesh had gone by the name osho rajneesh having 
dropped the honorific bhagwan which means god in hindi 
osho is a buddhist term that means on whom the heavens shower 
flowers 
the spokesman said the gurus last message communicated through 
his doctor said he would be always among his followers 
never speak of me in the past tense rajneesh said in his 
last message according to kirti my presence here will be 
greater without the presence of my tortured body 
rajneesh was deported from the united states in 1985 after 
pleading guilty to two counts of immigration fraud which alleged 
he arranged sham marriages so his followers could remain in the 
united states illegally he often claimed to have been poisoned 
while in jail awaiting trial and deportation 
rajneesh spent four years in central oregon where he set up a 
huge commune that became home to thousands of slavish disciples 
whose big thrill of the day was seeing the guru drive by and wave 
from the windows of one of his 93 rollsroyces 
rajneesh preached that materialism was good and his followers 
lavished him with riches the commune eventually collapsed after 
both rajneesh and his personal secretary were arrested 
his secretary was convicted of a variety of crimes including 
attempted murder in connection with a plot to take over the oregon 
county in which the commune was located 
in his final message osho said that since the days in jail in 
charlotte north carolina his body has been deteriorating said 
the statement read to the associated press by telephone 
while he was in oklahoma county jail he was poisoned with 
heavy metal thallium they exposed him to radiation in a way that 
it will not leave any proof it said 
osho had said he had kept the pain to himself but living in 
the body had become a hell the statement said 
rajneeshs death has triggered questions on the fate of his 
commune which has 500 branches across the globe 
a 15member group has taken over adminstration kirti said 
there are very capable people to take us through he said 
nothing has changed and nothing will change

following is the text of a nationally televised 
speech president mikhail s gorbachev made saturday on the fighting 
in azerbaijan the englishlanguage translation was provided by the 
official tass news agency 
comrades we all are witnessing a protracted interethnic 
conflict between azerbaijan and armenia we all are seriously 
concerned over the fact that the tension that arose there not only 
fails to subside but becomes aggravated from time to time leading 
to serious consequences every time 
over the past two years central authorities have sought to act 
for their part patiently and in thoughtful manner trying to solve 
difficult problems exclusively by peaceful political means 
a comradely dialogue discussions in the ussr supreme 
soviet the central committee of the party in the government 
through visits by ussr peoples deputies and repeated meetings 
in moscow with the leadership of the two republics and with 
deputies all have been used with the sole aim of achieving 
harmony and restoring good neighborly and simply human relations 
to find a way out of the dead end and in the final analysis to 
normalize the situation concerning nagornokarabakh 
by acting in this way we proceeded from the conviction that 
violence enmity and continuation of the conflict would not result 
in anything good but would only poison the atmosphere still further 
and lead to still greater loss of life and breed more violence 
unfortunately under these conditions party local government 
and state bodies of the two republics did not show due 
responsibility and thoughtfulness and quite often conceded 
principled positions under the pressure of nationalist groups 
this is how it happened lately when sessions of the supreme 
soviets of armenia and azerbaijan took decisions that run counter 
to the soviet constitution they not only failed to promote the 
normalization of the situation but on the contrary aggravated it 
and heightened confrontation 
neither side listened to the voice of reason conveyed with 
particular forcefulness from the rostrum of the second congress of 
the ussr peoples deputies 
the situation was made use of by antisocial antipopular 
elements for further stirring up enmity and exacerbation of the 
conflict armed clashes began particularly in border areas and in 
places where armenians and azerbaijanis lived side by side 
on jan 15 this year the presidium of the ussr supreme 
soviet had to adopt a decree introducing a state of emergency in 
the nagornokarabakh autonomous region and in some other areas of 
azerbaijan and armenia 
it would seem this measure should have stopped violence and 
brought to reason extremists and the leaders of popular fronts that 
plunged their peoples into an abyss of chaos and suffering 
but the voice of reason the voice of the soviet public and all 
peoples of our country was ignored this time also 
the calls for dialogue conciliation and tolerance remained 
unheeded 
moreover militant nationalcareerists continued to heat up the 
situation form groups of militants and to blockade roads and 
airports attacks on servicemen arms depots and law enforcement 
agencies became frequent 
the events assumed a particularly tragic character in baku 
rampages killings and the driving of innocent people out of their 
homes and to beyond the republic 
extremist forces actions in azerbaijan assumed increasingly 
overt antistate anticonstitutional and antipopular character 
the legitimate authorities were forcibly barred from performing 
their functions and government structures were disrupted in a 
number of areas 
engineering and technical facilities were destroyed along 
hundreds of kilometers of the state border the aim of a forcible 
seizure of power in the republic was not practically concealed 
it could no longer continue so along with deep compassion for 
the innocent victims wrath and indignation at criminal actions 
facts of brutal violence vandalism and the violation of laws have 
mounted in the country 
soviet people demanded from the countrys leadership resolute 
measures to restore law and order to ensure safety for people 
you already know that the decree of the presidium of the 
ussr supreme soviet has imposed a state of emergency in baku 
that units of the interior ministry and the soviet army have moved 
into the city 
they occupied key objects and took under control government 
buildings resolute measures are taken against ransackers 
organizers and instigators of disturbances fire arms and 
ammunition are seized from criminal elements 
to our deep regret there are victims military units were met by 
fire from terrorists in some places and had to use weapons in 
response 
grief came today into some houses i convey to these families my 
most sincere condolences 
the tragic events in baku the border areas of azerbaijan and 
armenia other regions of the caucasus have laid bare the price of 
nationalist rampage speculation on sacred national feelings it is 
a crime to push people to blind enmity to the madness of 
fratricidal war 
the state is dutybound to put an end to lawlessness and 
inhumanity to resolutely curb criminal actions of extremists who 
have lost human face who are prepared to take other peoples lives 
for the sake of personal ambitions selfish interests and power 
the state is dutybound to return peace and security to people 
and the possibility to develop in a free and democratic way to 
work normally live peacefully to raise and upbring children to 
the peoples of the two republics 
soldiers and officers of the soviet army and interior troops are 
fulfilling their duty in defending the ussr constitution and 
law 
the leadership hopes that the measures will be understood and 
supported by all peoples of our country 
at this hour i call on all citizens of azerbaijan and armenia to 
show wisdom and common sense not to give in to provocative slogans 
and actions i call on all those who have been deceived and misled 
or forcibly drawn into criminal actions to come to their senses and 
to stop 
i ask all of you to render every assistance in restoring civil 
peace in jointly overcoming the trial that befell our lot 
i deeply believe that common sense and responsibility would 
triumph would gain the upper hand 
today as never before we need national accord close cooperation 
and assistance to each other in the name of better life for all 
peoples of our state

pollution has never respected frontiers but 
theres something new in the air when a member of a soviet 
delegation pleads with americans to help block a new dam that would 
damage a wilderness valley in siberia 
the vocal support of environmentalists from around the world 
is critical to our efforts to save the valley said maria 
cherkasova secretary of the socioecological union one of the 
soviets largest private environmentalist groups 
she was a private citizen among the soviet officials at a 
meeting in washington last week of the ussoviet joint committee 
on cooperation in the field of environmental protection she called 
for a campaign of letters to president mikhail gorbachev and other 
soviet leaders on behalf of the katun valley near the chinese 
border 
pollution domestic and international is expected to be a 
lively issue in washington in the next few months this week the 
senate takes up a clean air bill that originated with the bush 
administration a similar bill is working its way through the house 
and agreement this year is widely expected though bush has 
threatened to veto it if changes in congress make it cost too much 
ms cherkasovas plea was cited by worldwatch institute as 
evidence of new eastwest cooperation on the environment the 
institute a nonprofit advocacy group found other examples 
the soviet government is already getting advice on more 
efficient use of energy which also means less pollution from the 
natural resources defense council in new york and the rocky 
mountain institute in colorado 
congress has decided to allocate a symbolic 40 million to 
help the environment in poland and hungary 
volkswagen of west germany will join with east germans to make 
a new less polluting supertrabbi to be sold in both 
countries the trabant satellite familiarly known as the trabbi 
has been the only readily available car in east germany the need 
for something else struck west germans sharply as more and more of 
them began to appear on their beloved autobahns driven by east 
germans and spewing thick streams of black from their twostroke 
engines 
denmark finland iceland norway and sweden will set up an 
investment company for joint environmental ventures in eastern 
europe 
hilary f french author of an article to appear in the 
marchapril edition of worldwatch magazine also found some 
cause for concern in the prospect of new relations between east and 
west she said environmentalists are worried that the rush to help 
eastern europes economy could lead to disasters 
even in the environmental area technology transfer could do 
more harm than good if it is simply a way for western companies to 
find new markets she wrote 
she suggested that western companies could try to sell obsolete 
equipment and emphasize what she called technological bandaids 
rather than root out pollution at the source as she urges 
in a longer study called clearing the air a global agenda 
she pointed out that pollution comes from both east and west 
norway for example imports 96 percent of the sulfur that 
falls on its soil most of it presumably from the east but it 
also exports 76 percent of its own emissions 
in the early 1980s the latest period for which french has 
figures milan italy had the highest annual average of sulfur in 
its atmosphere shenyang the old manchurian city of mukden was 
second shenyang also had more days in the year when the quantity 
was above the standard considered dangerous 146 days compared with 
66 days for milan 
she quoted the natural resources defense council as saying that 
new york violated the federal standard for ozone on 34 days a year 
two or three times a week all summer in los angeles it was 172 
days a year almost every other day she added that counties in 
which more than half of all americans live are out of compliance 
with ozone standards

critic of christian leader gen michel aoun was seized by gunmen 
saturday and held more than eight hours before being released aoun 
was accused of planning the abduction 
the reporter george hajj refused to talk to reporters after he 
was set free at about 230 pm a relative who did not want to be 
identified said he was not hurt 
aouns soldiers and syrian troops skirmished with machine guns 
tank cannons and mortars in north lebanon interrupting traffic 
along the highway connecting north lebanon and the christian 
enclave 
police said no casualties were reported but aouns command 
claimed in a communique that one syrian soldier was killed three 
were wounded and two syrian tanks destroyed by lebanese army fire 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said aouns claim could not be verified it was not 
known who started the fighting 
hajj was dragged from his apartment in the christian enclave at 
about 6 am according to his mother mrs badr hajj mrs hajj 
told the associated press that gunmen knocked on the door early 
in the morning george opened and they took him 
they didnt talk much they dragged him out mrs hajj said 
her voice choking with emotion 
hajj 55 works for the daily albayrak a newspaper that aoun 
closed last week as part of his attempt to muzzle dissent in the 
media he also is a member of the reporters syndicate executive 
board which has come under verbal attack from aoun 
the moslem voice of the nation radio and the leftist voice of 
the people which operate from west beirut accused aoun of 
arranging hajjs abduction 
colleague hajjs abduction is the latest move in aouns war 
against freedom of the press said voice of the nation which

state 
the civil war did not break our pens and aoun will not be able 
to break our pens the voice of the nation announcer said

operations of the albayrak and addiyar newspapers and the akhbar 
alyom newsletter for defying it

aouns measures 
the nations most prestigious daily paper annahar has not 
been publishing since tuesday to avoid either accepting the

deadline for the withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops who were 
deployed in lebanon in 1976 to quell civil war fighting 
aoun said the syrians violated the peacekeeping mandate by 
siding with the moslems in the war

a century ago this week irish 
immigrants stood with british blacks stood with whites and rival 
work gangs stood together for the first time in an ohio meeting 
hall to unite coal miners across the east 
the united mine workers of america union was born 100 years ago 
thursday 
one of our proudest traditions is our solidarity and our 
unity the willingness of our membership to fight and stay 
together said umw president richard trumka 
the modernday umw faces plummeting membership in the face of 
mechanization and has taken steps to ensure its survival in recent 
months the union has had informal discussions with the oil 
chemical and atomic workers union to affiliate with it an idea 
that already fell through once in 1988 
it reaffiliated with the aflcio last year and during the 1980s 
altered its constitution to allow it to represent nonminers such 
as machine shop workers its membership now stands at about 
150000 including about 100000 miners at its peak in the 1940s 
there were nearly 600000 miners on the rolls 
the biggest challenge is keeping our members working and 
keeping our safety standards intact said joy huitt umw 
secretarytreasurer from price utah who in 1986 became the first 
woman elected to a umw national office 
the mine workers union was formed from the national trades 
assembly and the national federation of miners and mine laborers 
organizations that fought as often with fists as with words 
their fighting legacy has carried over to the unions battles 
with coal mine operators armed security guards and the federal 
government there were battles within the union as well 
violent organization battles raged in the coal fields from the 
unions inception until the 1920s often organizing miners were 
killed by company guards seeking to put down dissent sometimes the 
guards were killed 
sixteen people were killed in a 1912 paint creek organizing 
battle ten people were killed eight years later in the matewan 
massacre a tragedy revived in the 1987 film matewan during 
the 1920s battle of blair mountain federal troops moved in to 
quell a labor march to logan 
i went to work before we got the union in here and remember 
the battles and the shootings said porter cotton 78 of 
chesapeake in kanawha county 
cotton started work as a trapdoor operator at age 13 before the 
union sought a minimum age for mine workers in the early days 
coal companies controlled their workers lives forcing them to 
shop in company stores see company doctors and live in company 
houses 
john l lewis became umw president shortly after world war i and 
stayed in charge into the 1960s he won health and pension benefits 
and shorter work weeks for union members but nearly tore the umw 
apart with his tyrannical rule and manipulation of votes and 
conventions said ron lewis a historian at west virginia 
university who is no relation to the labor leader 
lewis nearly destroyed the union in 1929 ron lewis said 
lewis purged all his enemies throwing out his best 
organizers 
membership dropped from 650000 in the early 1920s to about 
20000 in 1929 in part because of lewis purge but also because of 
a depression in the coal fields due to excessive production the 
historian said membership rebounded during the 1930s and 40s 
lewis reach extended to other industries he helped found the 
congress of industrial organizations and pound out labor agreements 
in the steel and auto industries and his union helped create the 
united steelworkers of america union in 1942 
he was a man of vision without a doubt probably the greatest 
labor leader trumka said look at what he did with the health 
funds and the vision he created for the union of bringing health 
care within 25 miles of every one of our members and then setting 
up a system of clinics 
three years after lewis stepped down wa tony boyle tried 
to maintain a similar hold on the umw miners grumbled at boyles 
inability to deliver the same contract gains and backed joseph 
jock yablonski for president 
boyle tried to steal the 1969 election but a federal judge 
questioned the results and ordered new balloting before it could 
be held however yablonski his wife and daughter were murdered in 
their pennsylvania home boyle was convicted of ordering their 
deaths 
the deaths brought the unions darkest days 
there are moments in our history that i would like to change 
but i dont know if id like to get rid of them trumka said 
you have to look at your mistakes and you have to remember them 
he said the union also must learn from the history of deaths in 
the coal fields including the shooting death on a west virginia 
picket line last week and the halfmillion cases of black lung 
disease 
trumka expresses optimism that total union membership in the 
united states will expand in the 1990s as workers recognize what he 
calls an antilabor sentiment in the country 
i think you will see workers standing up walking out and 
banding together in the streets to demand that will happen 
trumka said there will be one group of people who will be 
proudly in front in that movement and thats going to be the united 
mine workers

the navy reversing its forgiving approach to 
recruits who test positive for marijuana use has decided that they 
will be barred from entering the service 
you test positive for marijuana use youre gone said vice 
adm j michael boorda the navys chief of personnel in an 
interview on friday 
its an important twist and shows an increasing lack of 
tolerance for drug use in the military boorda said we dont 
want to lose the battle against drugs 
adm carlisle ah trost the chief of naval operations sent 
the antidrug message to his recruiting commanders earlier this 
month 
the new policy will go into effect feb 1 
previously the navy has given a second chance to recruits who 
tested positive for marijuana use in boot camp they were allowed 
to enter the service but only if their periodic drug tests showed 
they no longer used drugs 
the policy was designed to give recruits who might not have 
known better a chance to change 
at the same time the navy barred recruits who tested positive 
for cocaine and other hard drugs 
acting on the orders of congress all the services began testing 
recruits and officer candidates for drug and alcohol abuse in 1988 
the air force allows recruits to admit to marijuana use but 
once they are signed up they must quit using any drugs said maj 
lou figueroa a spokesman afterward those who are discovered or 
admit to drug use are released from the service he said 
army spokeswoman paige eversol said army policy allows anyone 
who tests positive for marijuana to try again six months later to 
enter the service if they test positive for cocaine they must 
wait a full year before reapplying 
in his message trost said he was taking the step to improve 
force quality 
boorda said the navy found those who tested positive in boot 
camp more prone to return to drug use and less likely to complete 
their fouryear enlistments 
if a person is not able to stop using drugs for 30 days before 
joining the navy they didnt want to be in the navy in the first 
place and well accommodate them he said 
the admiral who drafted the policy for trost said exceptions 
will be allowed but only for the most exceptionally deserving 
cases the waivers must be approved by boorda or his deputy and 
the cases are anticipated to be small in number trosts 
message said 
while the move allows the navy to be more selective about its 
personnel it is also a decision that has impact on the services 
evertightening budget 
about 2000 sailors tested positive for marijuana use during the 
past fiscal year of 1989 out of some 95000 recruits said a 
personnel officer who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
he said it costs 3000 to put a sailor through boot camp and 
that the navy could save money if it could ensure that those who do 
make it through remain in the service and maybe even reenlist 
were tightening the screws were serious about this he 
said every time we can keep a kid who is productive who has 
gone through advanced training who doesnt have to get new 
uniforms that saves money but if you keep a kid who turns out to 
be trouble its just not cost effective 
every dollar that we save we can put into programs to improve 
the quality of life for those people who want to serve he said

myles horton laughed when authorities 
padlocked his civil rights center 30 years ago you can padlock a 
building he said but you cant padlock an idea 
horton who survived attacks by the ku klux klan and 
mccarthyites died friday at age 84 he had slipped into a coma 
jan 13 after a 2year battle with cancer 
his highlander folk school one of the most influential training 
grounds in the us labor and civil rights movements was derided 
by his opponents as a finishing school for communists its 
adherents were called a cancerous growth spreading throughout 
the south 
the state of tennessee raided and padlocked highlander in 1959 
alleging it had violated its charter and illegally sold beer 
those rushing to the schools defense included martin luther 
king jr eleanor roosevelt andrew young pete seeger rosa parks 
and ralph david abernathy 
the school lives on today in the rolling foothills 20 miles east 
of knoxville as thkighlander research and education center 
serving as a network for activists in battles over the environment 
racism poverty and illiteracy 
battles are nothing new to the schools students 
the long haul an autobiography written with judith and 
herbert kohl and soon to be published by doubleday relates 
hortons role in the 1930s when highlander provided training for 
the congress of industrial organizations the cio and supported 
coal miners textile workers and farmers 
highlander and horton served as a bridge between the labor and 
civil rights movements herbert kohl said rosa parks for example 
had been to highlander two months before she sparked the 1955 
montgomery ala bus boycott 
in the book horton describes himself as a catalyst for social 
change 
if you want to change peoples ideas you shouldnt try to 
convince them intellectually what you need to do is get them into 
a situation where theyll have to act on ideas not just argue 
about them 
perhaps the best illustration of the philosophy was the 
citizenship schools project launched by highlander in 1956 on south 
carolinas sea islands septima clark an activist and close friend 
of hortons who helped organize it said it taught 100000 poor 
southern blacks to read and write and vote 
the schools encouraged emerging leaders to form community groups 
that became the backbone of the civil rights movement 
highlander now is adapting the concept to the environmental 
movement last year 400 people from more than 40 states and five 
other countries took part in a xrqgram called stp or stop the 
pollution stp schools this year will be held throughout the 
country to reach fledgling groups 
the son of a sharecropper horton grew up in savannah tenn 
and felt a moral obligation to act against injustice he is 
someone who always took responsibility for what is happening in 
the world kohl said 
horton attended cumberland university in tennessee and studied 
under theologian reinhold neibuhr at union theological seminary in 
new york before moving to the university of chicago after a year 
in europe he returned to grundy county tenn to help establish 
highlander folk school in 1932 
the school blended seminars on politics and economics with 
square dances and tales of local history the civil rights anthem 
we shall overcome was adapted from a black hymnal by hortons 
first wife zilphia johnson horton 
highlander was investigated by a senate internal security 
subcommittee in 1954 for its alleged ties to the communist party 
which horton denied 
while under investigation by a tennessee legislative committee 
five years later the school was raided and staffers arrested on 
charges of public drunkeness and possession of liquor one witness 
testified highlander was an integrated whorehouse 
it was ordered closed that year for violating its charter and 
selling beer without a license horton said guests and staff would 
take beer from a cooler and leave a few coins behind to cover its 
cost 
the state auctioned the highlander folk school but it reformed 
under its present name and moved to a black neighborhood in 
knoxville in 1971 it moved to its present location 
one year later horton retired as director but continued working 
and studying adult education movemgus in new zealand south 
africa india nicaragua and europe 
in 1983 andrew young and us rep ronald dellums dcalif 
nominated highlander for a nobel peace prize 
funeral services were set for sunday afternoon in monteagle 
where the highlander school used to be located

portauprince haiti ap this impoverished countrys 
military leader has pledged to hand over power in elections this 
year but political and human rights leaders are increasingly 
skeptical 
rather than moving toward democracy critics say lt gen 
prosper avrils regime is more and more taking on the trappings of 
a dictatorship complete with staged demonstrations of mass support 
and intolerance of opposition 
the government declared a state of siege saturday night hours 
after police rounded up opposition leaders it reinstituted powers 
to deport haitians a move one prodemocracy leader jeanclaude 
bajeux said could be used to throw them out of the country 
the possibility of elections is slim said joachim pierre 
general secretary of the centrist haitian christian democratic 
party even if avril were sincere his only support the 
presidential guard is opposed to them 
the presidential guard is the 1100member military unit that 
put down an army rebellion last spring that nearly toppled avril 
avril 51 who took office promising democratic reforms in a 
september 1988 soldiers revolt has scheduled presidential 
elections oct 28 with a runoff if necessary nov 25 
it would be haitis first attempt to hold independently run 
elections since nov 29 1987 the vote then was called off after 
squads of men in collusion with soldiers shot and hacked to death 
at least 34 people at polling stations 
in many ways the political climate today though far less 
violent is reminiscent of the months preceding the election day 
massacre at that time haiti was under the tyrannical rule of lt 
gen henri namphy the man avril ousted 
before the massacre for instance loyalists appeared on 
government television to urge namphy to cancel the vote and punish 
election organizers for allegedly serving foreign interests 
recently excrement was smeared on the headquarters of an 
opposition union and of the communist party along with graffiti 
urging avril to stay in power 
we recognize the authors by their signature the duvalierists 
governed us for generations leaving behind them a trail of blood 
and excrement said humanrights activist jeanclaude bajeux he 
referred to the 29year reign of the late francois papa doc 
duvalier and his son jeanclaude baby doc who fled into exile 
in february 1986 
avril has denounced his opponents as alien elements who are 
betraying haiti 
last week the popular radio satirist jeanandre destin 33 was 
shot to death while walking home from a latenight broadcast 
there was no proof of government involvement in the killing but 
dischler marcelin general secretary of the haitian association of 
journalists said in past months journalists have been targeted 
by the verbal attacks of the government and now the attacks have 
ended in bloodshed 
the staterun media meanwhile appear to be promoting an avril 
personality cult similar to namphys 
like namphy avril has made frequent highly publicized visits 
to provincial barracks and marketplaces to garner popular support 
though he is constitutionally ineligible to run in elections this 
year 
on his televised return from a weeklong state visit to taiwan 
avril was greeted by several thousand people many waving placards 
with such slogans as if avril goes haiti will be finished 
a reception cortege accompanied the 20member presidential party 
from the airport to the presidential palace passing through a 
triumphal arch erected for the occasion 
prominent opposition leader sylvio claude accused the government 
of staging the reception and of paying people to greet avril at the 
airport 
avril has said his was an interim government that would 
relinquish power to civilians he has partially restored the 
suspended 1987 constitution and permitted establishment of an 
independent electoral council to organize and supervise the vote 
this year 
the principle of elections should be defended said the 
prominent conservative politician hubert de ronceray but the 
conditions have not yet been created when you consider avrils 
contradictory statements 
haiti has been ruled by a succession of dictators virtually 
since winning independence from france in 1804 after a slave 
revolt and avrils promise of democracy met with skepticism from 
the start 
avril himself reinforced doubts in an interview published this 
month by the staterun newspaper lunion it quoted him as saying 
that while haiti is undergoing one of the most severe economic 
crises in its history it is hardly desirable that elections take 
place 
unlike the democratic euphoria that preceded the 1987 election 
day bloodbath haitians appear wary of another massacre and have 
not shown much enthusiasm for elections 
only one group a coalition of three parties called the alliance 
for progress and democracy has fielded a candidate prominent 
centerright politician marc bazin who was also a frontrunner in 
1987 
the already bad political climate has worsened after avrils 
spiteful comments about the opposition said arnold antonin 
coleader of the socialist national progressive revolutionary 
party which supports bazin 
even if avril allows elections there is no guarantee they will 
be fair less than two months after the 1987 massacre namphy 
staged armyrun elections which were widely boycotted by voters 
and denounced by most foreign observers as fraudulent 
political scientist leslie manigat was declared the winner but 
namphy ousted him in june 1988 after only four months of civilian 
government 
as a former close aide to the duvalier family avril has never 
been popular both the political right and left have criticized his 
economic policies such as a recent austerity program as likely to 
cause social unrest 
avrils credibility has been further damaged by his purge last 
year of radical soldiers and his frequent arrests of opposition 
leaders 
in november the government displayed three radical leaders on 
television with their faces badly swollen from apparent beatings 
the three had been jailed on charges of plotting to kill avril and 
blow up the presidential palace the arrests triggered a general 
strike that paralyzed the country for three days

manuel antonio noriega helped fidel castro 
subvert a us trade embargo against cuba through phony shipping 
labels and a freetrade zone in panama senate investigators say 
the conclusions are contained in the report of a threeyear 
investigation by the foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism 
narcotics and international communications headed by sen john 
kerry dmass 
the report issued in december 1988 is receiving renewed 
attention in the wake of the us invasion of panama that ended 
noriegas military rule the 170page document on drugs law 
enforcement and foreign policy cited us dealings with noriega 
as one of the most serious foreign policy failures for the united 
states 
according to the report cuban seafood and tobacco entered the 
united states while us high technology products made their way to 
cuba 
the report said noriega used the freetrade zone in colon to 
help cuban companies in panama the zone at the eastern entrance to 
the canal was established in 1953 as a center for the dutyfree 
transshipment of goods 
the panel relied heavily in that section of the report on the 
testimony of former noriega associate and adviser jose blandon he 
told the subcommittee that a firm in panama reciclaje sa is 
used by the cubans to import high technology to their country and 
they take it from panama to cuba 
blandon also said the free zone was used by cuba to avoid the 
us ban on the import of cuban products 
there is a system set up by the cuban government and noriega 
allowing cubans to export shrimp and lobster to the united 
states blandon said 
he said the shrimp and lobster were harvested by cuban fishing 
boats and brought into the panamanian port of vacamonte 
then they are sent to the united states as if they were shrimp 
fished in panama blandon said 
he said the crates containing the cuban seafood were labeled 
product of panama 
panama also harvests shrimp and lobster blandon said adding 
that the cuban catch was included in the panamanian seafood export 
figures 
he said panamanian seafood exports had increased but said that 
was because of the addition of the cuban seafood to the total not 
because the size of the panamanian fishing fleet had been enlarged 
examining other noriega business interests the kerry 
subcommittee said noriegas brotherinlaw ramon serio owned a 
company known as marinac which had been given a monopoly on issuing 
identity cards for the officers and crew members manning the 15000 
ships carrying panamanian registry 
blandon testified that sailors paid 80 for each pass while 
officers paid 100 
the subcommittee concluded the identity card business 
produces more than 20 million a year 
blandon also testified that noriega controlled the liquor 
concessions at panamanian airports the leather export monopoly 
the company controlling the free zone a television station a 
number of banks and other businesses 
the witness said that all of noriegas enterprises legal and 
illegal produced a huge income and a lifestyle that included a 
dozen houses luxury furnishings bmw automobiles vans 
helicopters and executive jets 
blandon said noriega also received some 3 million a year from 
the national bank of panama 
this is what he calls his petty cash which he carries in his 
own briefcase blandon testified 
large amounts of cash were reported to have been discovered when 
us troops occupied noriegas homes and offices last month

a group of progressive communists decided saturday 
that if the party leadership does not accept democratic reforms 
they will split off and form a social democratic party 
noncommunist political parties are not yet legal under national 
law but the baltic republics of lithuania and latvia in recent 
weeks have dropped their constitutional guarantees of communist 
supremacy and legalized multiparty systems 
president mikhail s gorbachev dropped his longstanding 
objection to alternative political parties last week saying it 
would be no tragedy if they cropped up in the soviet union 
the soviet communist party has already suffered one break the 
lithuanian communists voted in december to form their own communist 
party which favors independence for lithuania 
saturdays decision to threaten a party split came at a meeting 
in moscow of 494 progressive communists activist andrei koptyaev 
said the majority led by historian yuri afanasiev and economist 
gavriil popov leaned toward forming a social democratic party if 
their demands for democratic changes are not met koptyaev said 
in that case the group plans to hold an alternative party 
congress he said 
a minority led by former moscow communist party boss boris 
yeltsin preferred to try renovating the party by achieving a 
majority in the party leadership hopefully at the party congress 
set for october koptyaev said 
the reformers are principally concerned with the means of 
selecting delegates to the full party congress set for october he 
said 
in the past the delegates have been chosen from the top 
ensuring continued support for the status quo reformers are hoping 
for free election of delegates by the partys rankandfile in the 
belief they will force further reforms throughout the communist 
party 
in another sign of impending change in the partys structure and 
operations an article in saturdays sovietskaya kultura newspaper 
called for the party to give up its powerful bureaucracy and pass 
control of society to the soviet government 
a brief item on the same page said that a poll found that 56 
percent of the respondents favor abolition of article 6 of the 
soviet constitution which guarantees the party the leading role in 
all levels of soviet society 
however it also said 54 percent favored a proposal to retain 
the communist party as the only party in the country in equal 
partnership with other elements of the political system 
the article did not say who was polled who conducted it how 
many people were involved or what the percentage of error was 
an attempt to place the question of abolishing article 6 on the 
agenda of the december session of the congress of peoples deputies 
failed but the vote of 1139 to 839 was closer than many had 
expected

east germanys communist party chief early 
sunday called for radical reform and consolidation after an 
emergency session indicating a bid to dissolve the embattled party 
was unsuccessful 
the marathon meeting took place saturday while more proreform 
rallies drew tens of thousands of people 
party leaders met after factions called for dissolution saying 
reforms proceeded too slowly since hardline leaders were ousted in 
october 
the communist leader gregor gysi told the session that demands 
to split up are irresponsible and endanger the stability of the 
german democratic republic according to a statement issued by 
the leadership 
after the session ended shortly before midnight saturday gysi 
said radical reform and consolidation are standing further in 
the forefront for the communist party 
party leaders decided during the daylong session to use their 
powers in the interest of the people and the country and less for 
the party gysi added according to the brief dispatch from the 
official news agency adn thats designed to counteract the 
growing polarization among the people 
adn did not say how may leaders attended or if there was a 
formal vote but gysis comments indicated the leaders had not 
agreed to dissolve the party 
about 5000 doctors and other medical personnel demonstrated for 
higher wages and better working conditions in east berlin 
government television reported 
in the southern city of plauen about 35000 people took to the 
streets against the communists while 10000 farmers rallied in the 
city of neubrandenburg to demand higher prices for their products 
the television reported 
a conspicuous absentee from the party meeting was vicechairman 
wolfgang berghofer a leading reformer who was quoted friday as 
saying he would abandon the communists to join the opposition 
social democrats 
berghofers departure likely would spur others to leave the 
party which is under fire for being too slow to embrace reforms 
and relinquish control over many aspects of east german life 
desertion from party ranks is already in full swing gysi said 
the membership had plunged to 12 million from nearly 23 million 
in 1987 
however the party still has a grip on much of the nations 
business and political life 
west german leaders are actively seeking to help prodemocracy 
opposition forces and cautiously considering support for smaller 
established parties that are breaking with their decadeslong 
alliance with the communists 
free elections are scheduled in may the result of a fall 
prodemocracy movement that ousted the hardline leadership of 
erich honecker 
the west german government is convinced that the leadership to 
be elected in may will favor german unification and for weeks it 
has been outlining the bonn view of how the process will work 
west german chancellor helmut kohl on saturday proposed a joint 
government commission as part of his overall plan to speed the two 
countries toward unity 
the chancellor unveiled the idea of a joint germangerman 
government commission during a speech in bremen 
he said the commission would handle permanent consultations 
and political agreements between the two german nations kohl 
said he hopes the panel could be set up shortly after the elections 
despite democratic reforms introduced in east germany since 
honeckers fall in october thousands of east germans continue to 
leave the country for the west 
in downtown east berlins alexanderplatz on saturday thousands 
of shoppers lined up for the chance to buy western groceries at 
eastern prices 
the west berlin store kings weekly market set up a stand and 
sold bread fruit fish eggs beer and other items for east german 
marks to raise money for environmental projects in east germany

more than 2500 police and national guard troops 
brought their guns saturday to the tomb of the rev martin luther 
king jr the apostle of nonviolence to protect five white 
supremacists demonstrating nearby 
the enemy is at the front door they want us to hide under the 
bed shouted frankie johnson a 20yearold atlanta woman was 
among 75 counterdemonstrators who showed up despite suggestions by 
civil rights groups that they ignore the white supremecists 
authorities reported no violence at the rally led by 
mississippibased white supremacist richard barrett which was 
condemned in advance by president bush 
however the security arrangements caused the martin luther king 
jr center for nonviolent social change to close for the day 
the demonstration lasting less than an hour took place near 
the spot where a parade marking the king national holiday began 
monday across the street from kings gravesite 
that grave is not a throne that corpse is not a king we are 
here to bury a tyranny the mississippibased white supremacist 
said 
the georgia bureau of investigation said four supporters joined 
barrett a reporter earlier counted three 
as he left with a law enforcement escort barrett was jeered by 
some of the counterdemonstrators a racially mixed and mostly young 
group kept at least 200 yards away in the morning fog and drizzle 
barrett then went to forsyth county a virtually allwhite area 
an hour to the north where he drew a crowd of about 15 people at 
cummings city hall ten of the onlookers said they were members of 
ku klux klan groups and came to denounce barrett because he was an 
outsider and because of a past dispute in which barrett had opposed 
the use of klan robes 
barrett and one other man then staged a short march in the rain 
as 50 state and local officers kept watch 
hosea williams a city councilman and former king aide led 
about 60 civil rights supporters in two busloads from atlanta in a 
separate march through a quiet suburban area of forsyth county the 
buses passed about 75 onlookers some carrying confederate battle 
flags 
the civil rights group protected by about 225 local and state 
officers disbanded after a rally at which williams complained the 
county has failed to open sufficient opportunities for blacks since 
a huge civil rights march there in 1987 
williams said he did not want a confrontation with barrett but 
he said he was saddened to see kings gravesite made inaccessible 
by the protest and police 
dr king was the epitome of nonviolence williams said in 
forsyth county to see his grave surrounded by guns and violence 
certainly hurts me 
atlanta police reported two arrests one for disorderly conduct 
and one for public drunkenness in the vicinity of the rally 
there no arrests were reported in forsyth county 
the security effort in atlanta could cost more than 500000 
harry heath of the georgia department of defense estimated 
officials in forsyth county said security could cost an additional 
100000 there groups led by both barrett and williams have been 
pelted with rocks in past marches 
georgia gov joe frank harris objected to the park service 
decision to allow the white supremacist rally just a week after the 
federal holiday honoring king a harris aide contacted the white 
house twice to ask that the date of the groups permit be pushed 
back said the governors press secretary barbara morgan 
we thought that was pretty insensitive to issue it at that 
time when there are people here from all over the country all 
over the world she added we think it is rather unthinking and 
unfeeling 
jim howard a park service spokesman in atlanta said there was 
no record of the park service being contacted by the white house on 
the matter he said park service officials visited barrett in 
mississippi but failed to convince him to change his plans 
elsewhere saturday about a dozen robed ku klux klan members 
ambled through downtown bossier city la in a rally that 
attracted more police than demonstrators or spectators 
more than 50 officers including a swat team and horse patrols 
sealed off the government complex there were about 20 spectators 
many of them reporters said city attorney jimmy hall 
the klans area leader wayne pierce said earlier he expected 
200 to participate in the march which he billed as a show of 
strength to celebrate the rebirth of the klan in louisiana

pope john paul ii will visit czechoslovakia 
before june accepting the invitation of the new noncommunist 
government in prague a vatican spokesman said saturday 
the announcement comes two days after the czechoslovak 
government said it wanted to reestablish diplomatic relations with 
the vatican which have been suspended for 40 years 
the vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the date of the 
visit had not been determined but that it will would take place 
before the czechoslovak elections scheduled for june 8 and last two 
or three days he said the pope generally avoids visiting countries 
at the time of an election 
he said the pope had accepted with graditude the invitations 
from president vaclav havel and cardinal frantisek tomasek the 
roman catholic primate of czechoslovakia 
a thaw in relations is possible now because a popular revolution 
recently ousted czechoslovakias hardline communist leaders 
leading to broad democratic reforms that among other things 
loosen restrictions on religious freedom 
the vatican spokesman said officials would have to find a break 
in the popes schedule which includes a jan 25 to feb 1 trip to 
five african countries a may 614 visit to mexico and a may 2527 
trip to malta 
the austrian catholic news service kathpress citing 
unidentified vatican sources reported friday that the pope would 
visit czechoslovakia on april 2122 the rome daily il tempo also 
said the trip would be made on those dates 
navarro said those could be reasonable dates but for the 
moment there is no precise indication on when the pope will 
travel to czechoslovakia 
john paul formally accepted the invitations after meeting with 
archbishop jan sokol of trnava archbishop frantisek vanak of 
olomouc and a czechoslovak government delegation that included 
first vice president jan carnogursky vice president josef hromadka 
and foreign minister jiri dienstbier 
navarro said the invitation from tomasek came in the name of the 
priests and faithful in the three czechoslvak regions of bohemia 
morovia and slovakia he said the papal trip could include a stop 
in each of the three regions

john gotti ordered a union leader shot in 1986 
to avenge a slap in the face a prosecutor said as the reputed mob 
bosss assault and conspiracy trial got under way saturday 
gottis attorney said in opening arguments in state court that 
the charge was false and that his client was the victim of a 
modernday vendetta persecution and witch hunt 
assistant district attorney michael cherkasky described gotti 
49 as the ceo of the gambino crime family and codefendant 
anthony guerrieri 60 as a gotti soldier 
cherkasky said the defendants arranged with the westies a gang 
of vicious brutal killers from manhattans hells kitchen for 
the may 7 1986 shooting of john oconnor vice president of a 
carpenters union local 
oconnor who was shot four times in the buttocks and legs 
survived 
the prosecutor told the jury that oconnor who survived the 
attack was shot because he had sent thugs to trash a restaurant 
owned by gotti associate phillip philly modica 
cherkasky walked to the defense table stared pointed and said 
this man john gotti head of the gambino crime family ordered 
that assault 
then pointing at guerrieri cherkasky said this man anthony 
lee guerrieri assisted in the planning and execution of that 
assault 
the evidence will show that john gotti struck back because he 
could not allow a challenge to go unpunished the prosecutor said 
gottis attorney bruce cutler said government agents had 
followed his client to weddings and bar mitzvahs for 12 years and 
not once have they seen him commit a crime 
mr gotti hasnt been convicted of a crime in 15 years 
cutler said his friendships are not crimes 
cutler wondered how the state can find money to prosecute gotti 
because of who they say he is but is unable to find funds to 
house the homeless who huddle against the courthouse each night in 
cardboard boxes 
cutler said his client married to the same woman for 30 years 
and about to become a grandfather for the fifth time is not an 
ogre not a gangster 
the jury is expected to hear several tapes some of them barely 
audible which prosecutors say link gotti to the shooting 
one tape which acting justice edward mclaughlin ruled 
admissible as evidence contains a bugged conversation in which a 
voice said to be gottis talking about oconnor said someone 
would have to bust im up 
attorneys for both sides say jurors will also hear testimony 
from killers drug addicts wifebeaters and liars 
cherkasky said that although oconnor was the victim he would 
not be testifying and dismissed him as corrupt oconnor has been 
indicted on extortion perjury and larceny charges in the 
restaurant attack 
the jury has been sequestered and their names and addresses 
have been withheld to lessen the chances of them or their families 
being harassed

the port of baltimore was idled saturday when 
dockworkers went on strike and managers claimed the walkout could 
cause a permanent loss of business to competing ports 
about 2000 members of the international warehousemens 
association put up picket lines at the port where 13 ships were 
scheduled to call this weekend 
the strike was was triggered by a dispute between two of the 
ports five union locals over allocation of jobs under a tentative 
contract agreement that was to have been voted on by the rank and 
file on friday economic issues had been settled for the 
longshoremen who are paid 18 an hour 
port managers and elected officials warned that a strike of more 
than two weeks could prompt shipping companies to take their 
business to competing east coast ports dealing the city an 
economic blow 
that means were going to lose business some irretrievably 
said william j detweiler president of steamship trade association 
of baltimore an employers group therell be no ships coming 
here 
us rep helen delich bentley rmd said as many as 30000 
people could suffer direct or indirect loss of income because of 
the strike 
unfortunately so many people are going to be hurt so many 
families bentley said efforts to improve baltimores name 
will be put way back for a long time 
most of the ships due at the port were expected to be diverted 
to other harbors about 2500 ships call at baltimore each year 
but the number has been declining as shippers move to competing 
ports 
baltimore has lost 29 steamship lines in the last five years to 
the port of hampton roads va virginia ports have been especially 
effective in luring away much of the cargo that moved by rail 
between baltimore and the midwest 
gov william donald schaefer has threatened in recent weeks to 
take over the ports operations if there was a strike but he 
declined to comment on the walkout saturday 
the ila in baltimore is alone in the nation in having failed to 
reach an agreement on local work rules negotiations between the 
union and waterfront employers have dragged on since the contract 
expired in october 
the agreement that was to be voted by workers friday would have 
eliminated what management says is one of the ports worst 
problems rules allowing the union to decide when crews stop work 
for bad weather 
but the tentative accord prompted a dispute between two union 
locals one representing clerks and the other cargo handlers the 
pact would have reduced the number of clerks and increased the 
number of handlers 
when the clerks local complained to bowers the new york union 
president he ordered the workers vote blocked and recommended the 
dispute be submitted to a labormanagement committee

mayor marion s barry his political career 
jeopardized by his arrest on a cocaine possession charge plans to 
enter a substance abuse treatment program a close adviser to the 
mayor said saturday 
he knows that he needs help and that he cant deal with it 
under the pressure that he now has said the adviser who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity 
theres political wisdom to it but also there is his personal 
condition to think of here 
barry spokeswoman lurma rackley said that the mayor will make a 
statement on his personal life sunday but declined to elaborate 
wrctv reported on saturday that the mayor will postpone making 
any public statements about his political future for at least 30 
days 
barry 53 relinquished daytoday administration of the 
government friday to his top aide just hours after he appeared 
before a federal magistrate to answer charges stemming from his 
arrest in a downtown hotel thursday 
prosecutors say they have audio and video recordings of the 
mayor purchasing and using drugs in the company of a female 
acquaintance 
the aide said he did not know whether barry would seek treatment 
on an inpatient or outpatient basis or whether the treatment 
would take place in washington or another location 
the aide also said the treatment decision would be considered 
independent of other tough choices the mayor now faces including 
whether to resign from office 
even though everything here is intertwined with the other 
problem treatment must come first said the aide we persuaded 
him he needs help and you cant put a time limit on it but 
solutions to the other issues will evolve later 
a barry cabinet member also speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the mayor has at least considered the political ramifications 
of entering a treatment program 
thats not to say the mayor is ready to admit he has a 
problem said the source he realizes that getting treatment 
would be helpful to him if only because it would reduce the 
pressures he is under both politically and legally 
the issue of drug treatment barrys control of the government 
and whether the mayor should seek reelection were first raised 
during a stormy twohour meeting friday between barry and his top 
political advisers 
barry tentatively agreed not to run for reelection 
barrys decision to enter a treatment program after further 
discussions with top aides and advisers late friday and on 
saturday aides said 
one adviser said that barry has been persuaded of the futility 
of running for reelection in a city plagued by drug abuse and 
drugrelated homicides 
he is resigned to it said one adviser who urged the mayor 
to scuttle his reelection effort during a tense twohour session 
on friday and in a later strategy meeting it is a foregone 
conclusion and the mood in there was like that of an irish wake 
the adviser said he was uncertain when barrys decision would be 
made public 
barrys reelection announcement which had been scheduled for 
sunday was postponed obviously the aide said 
maybe that postponement will just go and go and go 
indefinitely the aide said 
jim vance one of a handful of television reporters called to 
barrys home saturday evening reported that the mayor is not 
going to make any decisions about his political life for at least 
30 days 
the wrctv reporter noted that he had known barry for about 20 
years both personally and professionally and agreed to the 
mayors request that most of their hourlong conversation be held 
confidential 
however he said he could report the mayors plans to delay a 
political decision and that barry planned a statement sunday 
morning on his personal life 
the barry adviser who spoke only on condition that he not be 
named said he is confident that the mayor will honor his pledge to 
drop plans for a fourth fouryear term in november 
however barry has frequently changed his mind on city issues 
without informing his aides 
if he is willing to go back on minor decisions involving the 
day to day operations of the government he could certainly do so 
here said a longtime associate of the mayors but when he has 
time to reflect on this he will realize that there really is no 
way he can run again the decision he apparently reached friday is 
one that eventually he will have to honor even if he tries first 
to go back on it 
even if barry does not run for reelection he has not yet 
indicated any willingness to resign the sources said 
we havent talked about whether he will resign yet said one 
adviser who participated in fridays meeting these things will 
all be dealt with in time but the immediate concern was making a 
change for now 
jeff gildenhorn a fundraiser for the mayor who participated in 
fridays meeting stopped short of saying barry had agreed not to 
seek reelection 
however gildenhorn said he was confident the mayor will do 
what is best for him mentally and physically and for the city 
these are very trying times and we want to direct the mayor 
in the right direction gildenhorn said at this point we have 
suggested that the mayor reevaluate his position and we want 
him to be thinking clearly and lucidly 
wrctv citing law enforcement sources reported that the 
cocaine possession charge barry faces will not be dropped unless 
the mayor resigns 
in an interview on wusatv us attorney jay stephens said it 
was not appropriate for him to comment on whether the charges 
would be dropped if the mayor resigns 
but he said he was very sensitive to the concerns of this 
community to the people in this community and the need to have an 
effective government in place 
there are a broad range of considerations as united states 
attorney that i would consider beyond the simple issue of holding 
mr barry accountable for his criminal conduct stephens said 
barry burst into tears when informing his cabinet that city 
administrator carol b thompson would be handling the routine 
chores of government said a cabinet source 
in a statement released by his office on friday barry suggested 
that he will stay involved in the government saying he would be in 
touch with thompson and other officials several times a day to 
monitor how his administration is functioning 
barrys departure from the race would open the door for a 
mayoral candidacy by jesse l jackson who moved to the nations

a top military general alleged 
saturday that the us ambassador to pakistan and a state 
department envoy directed moslem rebels in their attack on the 
eastern city of jalalabad in march 
lt gen abdul haq ulumi a secretary for military forces also 
claimed that two pakistani artillery units participated in the 
fighting 
the plan to attack jalalabad was directed under the leadership 
of robert oakley and peter thomsen with the direct participation 
of two artillery military units of the pakistan armed forces 
ulumi told foreign journalists 
oakley is the us ambassador to pakistan and thomsen is a 
state department envoy 
ulumi said there was clear evidence to support his 
allegations but he did not elaborate 
in washington state department spokesman mark dillen said it 
appears to be an old allegation that had very little currency back 
then because it was so preposterous he added that he had no 
firsthand knowledge of what the afgan officer said saturday but 
it does sound reminiscent of charges heard earlier and quickly 
dismissed 
afghan guerrillas said saturday they killed 16 government 
soldiers including gen ajab khan and destroyed a cargo plane 
during heavy fighting around the eastern city of khost the 
guerrilla report from islamabad pakistan which could not be 
independently confirmed said the plane was downed saturday but it 
did not say when the 16 soldiers were reportedly killed 
in his talk with journalists ulumi claimed pakistani troops 
dressed in afghan clothes fought alongside the guerrillas in 
eastern afghanistan four times in 1989 
pakistan has denied its troops ever participated in the 
neighboring civil war between the sovietbacked government and 
moslem guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
the guerrillas launched an allout attack on jalalabad a 
strategic city on march 6 three weeks after the soviet union 
withdrew the last of its forces from afghanistan 
the city of about 65000 people is about 40 miles from the 
border with pakistan where the guerrillas are based and it would 
have given them a major foothold in the country 
guerrillas overran a key army garrison outside jalalabad but 
their drive to capture the city eventually halted under withering 
artillery fire and aerial bombing by communist forces 
casualties on both sides were estimated in the thousands it was 
seen as a humiliating defeat for the guerrillas who have yet to 
conquer any major afghan city 
ulumi lashed out at foreign backers of the mujahedeen who 
include the united states 
still the attacks continue in the frontier provinces of the 
country with the support of the governments of the united 
states pakistan saudi arabia and their allies he said such 
activities can only be called terrorism 
afghanistans ruling marxists seized power in a 1978 military 
coup that sparked the insurgency soviet troops came to their aid 
in december 1979

for years marion shepilov barry jr mayor of 
the capital since 1979 bragge that he was the fellow who hadnt 
been caught even as so many of his chums and associates even a 
wife had seen the back side of a cell door 
he had his vices he acknowledged but as he told the los 
angeles times in a memorable barroom interview just a month ago 
im not stupid enough to have done the things they accuse me of 
god gave me a good brain 
what i have done he repeated nobody knows about because 
i dont get caught 
in that same conversation marion barry 53 had pronounced 
himself politically invincible and for a few moments friday 
he seemed just as cocksure when he was led into a federal courtroom 
to be arraigned on a misdemeanor count of possession of crack 
cocaine the very drug which is the scourge of the city and has 
turned it into the nations murder capital 
in customary regal stride he headed for the table marked 
defendant and with rocksteady nerves poured a glass of water 
to the brim he teased a courtroom artist who was focusing on him 
through tiny binoculars by encircling his own eyes with his 
fingers 
then the magistrate noted that if convicted marion barry could 
go to jail for a year suddenly the mayors facial muscles 
betrayed him the cool smile vanished replaced by clenched teeth 
perhaps only then had reality sunk in 
barry despite dozens of prior stories alleging episodes of drug 
abuse womanizing mystery trips and inattention to the citys 
business had planned to formally announce on sunday his candidacy 
for a nokrth term and with a political machine rivaling that of 
the late richard daley of chicago few would have ruled out his 
chances even against the prospect that washingtons other 
preeminent black hero the rev jesse jackson was himself eyeing 
the office 
no more barry in tears late friday yielded daytoday control 
of city government which employs one out of every 12 dc 
residents to a deputy carol b thompson to prepare his defense 
the governments case includes a positive drug test and video and 
audio tape which prosecutors say recorded him buying and smoking 
crack in a hotel room occupied by a longtime girlfriend who 
cooperated with the fbi and aides portrayed the mercurial barry on 
saturday as having accepted the notion that he cannot run again 
the decision now they said is whether he should resign 
a close adviser to barry said saturday the mayor planned to 
enter a substance abuse treatment program and a local television 
station reported decisions about his political future were on hold 
for at least 30 days 
for years barrys black supporters including jackson a fellow 
lieutenant in martin luther kings civil rights crusade had lined 
up behind the mayor when he denied misconduct and swore time and 
again that he had never used drugs by his account such reports 
were generated by a venal white media and a republican 
administration eager to reclaim the reins of city government from 
the black community 
but while jackson rarely at a loss for words held his tongue 
over the mayors arrest others felt pushed over the brink 
especially in the schools where barry like jackson routinely 
preached against the evils of cocaine the sense of betrayal 
erupted in shouts of pain and despair 
what makes me so mad is that the mayor is black representing 
us our race declared anthony witcher to his high school history 
class doesnt he know the stereotypes someone like me already 
faces this just makes it worse i just know it will be worse 
and this from junior classmate terri dantzler he goes around 
telling us not to do drugs then does them himself i feel pitiful 
and he should be ashamed 
among community and political allies the dismay extended to 
another question as well at that was how a man who so prides 
himself on his intelligence who already was under scrutiny for 
prior unexplained forays into a hotel room occupied by a confessed 
drug dealer have walked into so such a trap 
it raises the gary hart question how can one person be so 
stupid said democratic pollster mark mellman referring to the 
former presidential candidate who challenged the media to track his 
personal life then spent time with a woman other than his wife 
us attorney jay stephens said barrys arrest at a downtown 
hotel was part of the ongoing investigation of a broad range of 
allegations against the mayor dating to the discovery that he 
had visited a former dc employee charles lewis in a separate 
hotel a year ago 
lewis was sentenced friday to 15 months in prison for conspiracy 
to distribute and possess cocaine he told the court that he had 
obtained at least 140 worth of crack for barry on at least three 
occasions and once believed that he should lie and go to jail to 
protect the mayor 
as an outgrowth of the lewis investigation authorities enlisted 
the help of rasheeda moore a former model who had been intimate 
with the mayor for several years according to several news reports 
which quoted anonymous sources it was she who lured him to the 
fbis sting setting on thursday the reports said 
reports that barry had used cocaine date to 1981 when police 
were tipped that patrons at a nightclub this is it had seen 
him snorting the drug police said that report and others could 
never be corroborated 
another female acquaintance of the mayor karen johnson a 
convicted drug dealer was jailed for eight months for refusing to 
testify over whether she sold cocaine to barry 
a month before he was elected in 1979 barry acknowledged to the 
washington post that he used to run around with guys who went to 
prison or are dead i was lucky i was the one who didnt get 
caught when we were out shooting dice or something 
since then a dozen more of his close associates including his 
second wife mary treadwell and two deputy mayors have been 
jailed over various charges of misconduct as barry built a city 
government unrivaled on a per capita basis for its size and 
just a month ago barry was still boasting this time to a los 
angeles times reporter that no cop had laid a glove on him 
on thursday with a few alleged puffs on a drug pipe all that 
went up in smoke

the archbishop of canterbury said 
saturday the sovietbacked government agreed on a churchorganized 
relief plan for an estimated 4 million drought victims in northern 
areas where rebels are fighting army troops 
robert runcie spiritual head of the anglican church told 
reporters he hoped the relief operation led by a consortium of 
three churches will start soon and that no obstructions will be 
allowed to block it 
famine must never be used as a weapon of war runcie added 
under the plan runcie said a consortium of three churches known 
as the joint relief partnership would be allowed by the government 
of president mengistu haile mariam to distribute food in the 
embattled northern provinces of tigre and eritrea 
the joint relief partnership consists of the ethiopian orthodox 
church the protestant mekane yesus evangelical church and the 
ethiopian catholic church 
the archbishop did not say if the agreement between the 
government and the consortium has been signed or whether the 
churches have been assured of safe passage for relief supplies by 
rebel groups in the two provinces 
the eritrean peoples liberation front has been fighting a war 
of secession in ethiopias northernmost province for nearly three 
decades just to the south the tigrean peoples liberation front 
seeks the overthrow of mengistu 
runcie was ending a sixday visit in which he met with mengistu 
and other top government officials and visited asmara the 
provincial capital of eritrea which remains in government hands 
the united nations has appealed for 700000 tons of food and 
called for an international relief operation of major 
proportions to avert a repeat of the 198485 famine when an 
estimated 1 million people died in ethiopia

china said saturday it will quicken the pace of 
democracy in hong kong as a critical meeting came to a close on the 
future of the british colony which reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
but beijings position which it called a major concession 
fell considerably short of the wishes of the territorys 
politicians 
china also announced further restrictions on top officials of 
the british colony ruling that only 15 percent of the territorys 
legislators could hold foreign passports after beijing assumes 
control 
and it indicated it would effectively split the post1997 
legislature into two houses in a decision that could facilitate 
chinas control over the lawmaking body 
the decisions were taken in canton by a subgroup of the basic 
law drafting committee which is writing the blueprint for hong 
kongs future under chinese rule 
arguments broke out throughout the day between the six delegates 
from hong kong and the 10 from china all have been appointed by 
beijing 
at the end of the day four hong kong delegates announced that 
none of the territorys six delegates supported the pace of direct 
elections 
we regard ourselves as accountable to the hong kong people 
they said in a statement 
on july 1 1997 hong kong will revert to chinese rule faith in 
chinas promise to retain the colonys freewheeling capitalist 
system for 50 years evaporated after the june 34 military 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in beijing 
the crackdown sparked greater calls for democracy in hong kong 
politicians began pushing for 20 of the legislatures 60 seats to 
be directly elected in 1991 rising to completely direct elections 
in 2003 they said a strong democracy would enable hong kong to 
resist an unstable government in beijing and slow hong kongs 
brain drain 
saturday the basic law committee agreed to speed up 
democratization but not as fast as hong kong politicians would 
like under the majority decision 18 seats would be directly 
elected in 1997 rising to 30 seats by 2003 china previously said 
there would only be minor changes after 18 legislators were elected 
in 1997 
but in a move interpreted by some as a limit on democracy the 
committee also decided to effectively split the legislative council 
into two houses one of directlyelected members and one of 
members chosen by special interest groups such as labor unions and 
professionals 
under that plan any laws must pass a majority of each group

china on saturday announced new restrictions on 
foreign journalists banning them from filing reports it considers 
false or endangering national security unity or societys common 
interests 
the broadly worded regulations give the government wide latitude 
for controlling foreign journalists following the jan 11 lifting 
of martial law in beijing the martial regulations had placed tight 
restrictions on reporters 
the information department may give warnings or revoke the 
accreditation of journalists who violate the regulations one 
clause said 
foreign journalists and resident foreign news organizations 
should observe professional news ethics and not distort the facts 
create rumors or use improper methods to interview or report 
said the regulations which were signed by premier li peng on 
friday and took effect immediately 
foreign journalists cannot carry out activities that are 
incompatible with their status or that endanger chinese national 
security unity or societys common interests the rules said 
china criticized as distorted most foreign reporting on the 
prodemocracy protests last spring and the june 34 army attack 
that crushed them killing hundreds and possibly thousands of 
people 
the government maintains the protests were a foreigninstigated 
plot to overthrow the communist system 
during the protests chinese consulates abroad stopped issuing 
work visas for visiting journalists and dozens entered with 
tourist visas 
in june the government expelled two american reporters based in 
beijing one an associated press reporter and the other from the 
us governmentfunded voice of america radio 
the new regulations do not explain what are considered improper 
methods of gathering information under martial law all interviews 
had to be approved by military authorities 
the regulations make no mention of informal or onthestreet 
interviews which were permitted before martial law was imposed may 
20 even since martial law was lifted however few chinese have 
dared to give onthestreet interviews even officials often regard 
interviews as political risks 
it was not clear if the new regulations supercede a 1986 set of 
rules that required foreign journalists to get approval 10 days in 
advance before leaving beijing to report elsewhere in china that 
rule has been used mainly to keep journalists from visiting tibet 
where buddhist monks and nuns have repeatedly demonstrated for 
independence

a lesbian couple and a homosexual man who 
refuse to renounce sex were ordained saturday by two lutheran 
congregations defying church policy at the risk of expulsion 
our congregation felt this was a social justice issue that 
gays are part of the rainbow coalition of gods creation said 
the rev john frykman of first united lutheran church in a 
workingclass neighborhood 
jeff johnson 26 was ordained before 600 members of the 
congregation which voted last month to hire him 
johnson has refused to take a vow of celibacy required of 
homosexual pastors but not normally mandated for heterosexuals 
we see this as what god is asking us to do we have no vested 
interest said frykman adding that to his knowledge none of his 
congregations 120 members are homosexual 
at st francis lutheran church near the largely gay castro 
district ruth frost 42 and phyllis zillhart 32 were ordained 
the two congregations hope the homosexual ministers who will 
not be recognized by the denomination can bring many homosexuals 
back to the flock among other things the three endorsed the 
concept of gay marriages 
the ordinations along with that of a homosexual episcopal 
pastor in hoboken nj last month with an acknowledged male mate 
represent a foothold in mainstream christianity by homosexuals 
the 52 millionmember evangelical lutheran church of america 
formed in 1987 by the merger of three lutheran groups bans 
ordination of selfavowed practicing homosexuals 
bishop lyle miller has asked a disciplinary committee to 
consider punitive action against the congregations the dissident 
parishes could be censured suspended permanently removed from the 
denomination or exonerated 
during the twohour ceremonies the ministerial candidates took 
the customary vows then added another to be diligent workers 
for justice on behalf of lesbian and gay sisters and brothers 
supporting our coming out championing our rights challenging 
societys prejudices and encouraging our relationships and 
marriages 
our churchs policy requiring celibacy for lesbians and gay 
men is an unjust vow of life johnson said before ordination 
it is a politically motivated scandal which would deny the 
reality of lifegiving intimate creative sexual relationships 
among lesbians and gay men 
despite official church objections a sizable minority of the 
denominations lay activists and several dozen pastors have openly 
supported ordaining active homosexuals 
the local congregations say they cannot be ordered to refuse 
recognition of the new ministers 
we decided that punishment even expulsion is a risk we would 
run for the sake of whats right said the rev james delange 
senior pastor at st francis 
johnson graduated last year from pacific lutheran seminary in 
berkeley calif frost and zillhart are recent graduates of 
lutheran northwestern theological seminary in st paul minn and 
have been a couple for the past five years 
the three will serve as assistant pastors and manage an outreach 
program for northern california homosexuals 
the special ministry was organized to encourage gays and 
lesbians to come back into the church and to encourage 
congregations to welcome them as members said delange 
we have allowed people who neither share nor understand our 
experience to define our lives for us frost said at a news 
conference this must stop it is time we embraced ourselves as 
well as one another 
miller has said that because the three have declared they 
practice homosexuality the ordinations cannot be recognized

the united states suspects that israel has sent 
cluster bombs to the marxist ethiopian government the new york 
times reported 
quoting unidentified administration officials the newspaper 
said in its sunday editions there were unconfirmed reports that the 
ethiopian government has already used the bombs against rebels in 
the northern part of the country 
the state department officials didnt tell the times when the 
bombs might have been sent to ethiopia also it was unclear how 
many bombs were involved or whether the bombs were made in the 
united states or israel 
one unidentified official told the newspaper that descriptions 
of attacks correspond to the sound and effects of cluster bombs 
although no physical evidence has been recovered 
a cluster bomb is a destructive antipersonnel weapon consisting 
of a canister packed with small bombs when the bomb is dropped 
from an aircraft a small explosion opens the canister in midair 
and the bomblets spread over an area several hundred feet in 
diameter 
israel has developed its own version of the bomb but the united 
states contends that israel cannot export it without us approval 
because it was manufactured using american technology 
ethiopia restored diplomatic ties with israel last year and 
since then the united states has been concerned about israels 
intentions to send arms to ethiopia israel wants to build a strong 
relationship with the government in addis ababa because it wants 
cooperation in allowing ethiopian jews to emigrate to israel 
the matter first was made public last month by former president 
jimmy carter after a trip to ethiopia carter said at a news 
conference he had been told the ethiopian air forced had obtained 
cluster bombs from one of our middle east allies to be used 
against rebel villages

portauprince haiti ap the military government declared a 
state of siege saturday night after the slaying of an army colonel 
and police reportedly arrested and beat several opposition leaders 
the government led by lt gen prosper avril said the 30day 
decree was needed to protect democratic accomplishments against 
terrorism but opposition leaders said it was an attempt to 
silence dissent before promised elections in october 
the united states deplored the actions by the government saying 
they put at risk the democratic transititon in haiti 
government television said under the state of siege four 
articles of the constitution were suspended including one that 
forbids the deportation of haitian nationals 
at least one of the opposition leaders conservative hubert de 
ronceray later was reported deported max care a coordinator of 
de roncerays party said de ronceray was deported saturday night 
to miami 
the government said it also reestablished an entry visa 
requirement for haitians returning from abroad to prevent the 
infiltration of terrorist agents the practice abolished shortly 
after dictator jeanclaude duvalier was ousted in 1986 often was 
used to screen haitians returning home 
an earlier statement also read on the tv said the government 
is taking all steps to prevent destabilizing maneuvers liable to 
compromise the democratic process under way 
one opposition leader jeanclaude bajeux said in puerto rico 
he expected that all the opposition leaders rounded up saturday 
will certainly get put on a plane and be deported 
avril will go to bed tonight with lots of enemies hes 
turning against everyone on at once bajeux said 
in washington the state department issued a harsh criticism of 
the decree and the arrests and urged the haitian government to 
rescind his actions and reiterate its commitment to free elections 
by suspending four articles of the constitution declaring a 
state of seige and arresting a number of political leaders the 
government of haiti has put at risk the democratic transititon in 
haiti said the statement read by department spokesman richard 
boucher 
especially disturbing is the deportation without charges 
evidence of due process of democratic opposition leaders the 
statement said 
privately owned radio antilles said police earlier saturday 
arrested de ronceray and louis roy a wellknown civic leader who 
founded the haitian red cross and is coauthor of the 1987 
constitution roys nephew jeanclaude roy confirmed the arrest 
roys whereabouts could not be determined saturday night but 
relatives said they believed he was at the airport awaiting 
deportation 
eight plainclothes gunmen also arrested socialist leader serge 
gilles and three members of his progressive national revolutionary 
party at gilles home witnesses said gilles was thrown to the 
ground and stomped on in front of his two small children while the 
others were beaten in the groin with the butts of the guns 
witnesses said 
radio antilles said police also arrested dr sylvain jolibois 
leader of the small radical jeanjacques dessalines group jesner 
prudent coordinator of the centerright movement to establish 
democracy in haiti party and several members of de roncerays 
rightist mobilization for national development party 
care said all of de roncerays activists were released late 
saturday he said he thought jolibois who was beaten on the head 
and other arrested opposition leaders and militants would be 
released as soon as they were treated for their injuries at police 
headquarters

eye care said adding that his back was covered with bruises 
from beatings 
georges werleigh a member of gilles party said he gilles 
prudent and five other activists of various parties were 
transported to the national palace beaten again and taken to 
police headquarters there werleigh said police released them and 
said the arrests were a mistake 
the police sweep came after col andre neptune his wife and a 
servant were shot to death while riding home friday night in the 
portauprince suburb of fontamara sgt emmanuel eugene duty 
officer at the national palace said the motive for the killings 
was unknown 
earlier saturday de ronceray said 10 heavily armed soldiers 
entered his home without a warrant before noon and searched it de 
ronceray said one of the soldiers asked mrs de ronceray where 
their weapons were hidden 
she responded pointing to the bible this is the only weapon 
we have against brute force de ronceray told the associated 
press before his arrest 
de ronceray who has urged avril to resign also was a key 
leader of the opposition to duvalier who fled to france in 1986 
following months of protest 
avril who took power in a september 1988 soldiers revolt has 
promised to hand over power after elections this year but 
political and human rights leaders are increasingly skeptical

chief f dale robertson said the monthly rates for grazing 
livestock on grasslands in colorado kansas nebraska new mexico 
north dakota oklahoma south dakota texas and wyoming will rise 
57 cents to 286 per head month 
the bureau of land management an arm of the interior 
department announced last week that the fee for grazing on its 
lands in 17 western states would fall 5 cents to 181 per month 
the forest service charges the same fee for grazing on some of its 
other lands

changes in private grazing rates costs of livestock production and 
other factors

holders who graze more than 200000 animals on the grasslands each

arson is suspected in the fire aboard 
the uss forrestal which injured 11 sailors in october and caused an 
estimated 25 million in damage according to a navy report 
navy investigators however have not determined who started the 
fire and no arrests have been made a newspaper that obtained a 
copy of the report said in its friday editions 
although investigators have not been able to pinpoint the exact 
cause of the fire they found no evidence to suggest that it was 
started accidentally 
most logically the fire was intentionally set said the 
report obtained by the florida timesunion in a freedom of 
information act request 
the fire broke out at 830 pm on oct 9 three days before the 
forrestal was to leave mayport naval station northeast of 
jacksonville on a scheduled sixmonth deployment to the 
mediterranean sea 
repairs delayed deployment until nov 3 
lt frank thorp a navy spokesman in washington said he could 
not speculate whether the fire may have been set in an attempt to 
delay the ships departure 
the blaze started on the second deck in a funneltype structure 
called an uptake in the ships no 1 main machinery room the 
uptake forces combustion air into propulsion boilers 
investigators also said materials used to clean up a fuel spill 
on the carrier four days earlier were improperly stored allowing 
the blaze to quickly spread but the report praised crew for 
limiting damage to the ship 
the fire traveled through electrical cable to the no 1 elevator 
machinery room on the second deck then ignited a blaze off one of 
the carriers hangar bays 
the elevator is one of four used to transport aircraft from the 
hangar deck to the flight deck 
the machinery room houses the motors and cables used to raise 
and lower the elevators 
in addition to the injuries smoke spread through the carrier 
forcing the evacuation of 1000 sailors

an attorney for wayne williams said friday he 
would file petitions next month appealing williams murder 
convictions in the atlanta child killings and the papers might 
include a confession from another person 
we may have a shocker in the way of a confession new york 
civil rights attorney william kunstler said in a telephone 
interview its not been reduced to writing at all its 
something in that line a confession but we cant commit to it 
kunstler a member of williams legal team said he notified 
butts county superior court judge william h craig of his intention 
to file papers in the case feb 9 
also participating in the conference call with craig on friday 
was a representative of the state attorney generals office which 
must respond to the williams filing before a hearing is held 
attorney general michael bowers was out of his office friday 
and could not be reached for comment an assistant said he had no 
immediate comment on kunstlers plans 
kunstler declined to elaborate on the confession other than to 
say it is from someone other than williams 
i am hopeful that the state of georgia will recognize that a 
monumental miscarriage of justice has occurred kunstler said 
williams a selfproclaimed talent promoter and freelance 
photographer was convicted of murder in 1982 of two of 29 young 
blacks killed in atlanta from 1979 to 1981 he currently is serving 
two life sentences 
during his trial in which the prosecution used fiber evidence 
williams was linked to 10 other deaths in the string of slayings 
that gripped the city for more than two years 
the georgia supreme court upheld williams convictions in 1983 
but a team of lawyers including kunstler launched a new round of 
appeals 
kunstler said he expected a hearing could be held within a month 
of his filing

protesters formed human roadblocks friday to 
twice block a state team from touring one of two proposed sites for 
a dump for lowlevel radioactive wastes 
members of citizens against radioactive dumping or card 
prevented a threemember crew from the state lowlevel radioactive 
waste siting commission from reaching a farm owned by arthur allen 
who has offered 730 acres of his property to the state as a site 
for a waste dump 
they can come back as often as they want theyll still find 
us here said margie schlegel who had spent the previous 32 
hours on alert at the antidump groups base camp 
there were no arrests and both incidents were orderly said 
cortland county sheriffs lt chauncey bennett 
both times after lengthy confrontations the commission 
people withdrew he said 
during the morning a large throng of protesters backed by about 
a dozen cars and pickup trucks blocked the team from entering on a 
back road to allens farm said paul yaman a cochairman of the 
group the car carrying the commission workers was spotted by one 
of cards patrols he said 
the protesters kept the car trapped for about 30 minutes before 
a cortland county sheriffs deputy arrived and told them they were 
illegally blocking a public road 
card members in four cars followed the inspection team the 
remainder of the morning at about noon the protesters again 
formed a roadblock on another road stopping the state car about 
three miles short of allens farm said schlegel 
the crew sat in their car for two hours before leaving she said 
protesters did not prevent other cars from passing on either 
road said bennett 
siting commission officials say they need to inspect the five 
proposed dump locations three in allegany county and two in 
cortland county before they can begin preliminary tests on the 
sites following those tests the number of sites will be narrowed 
to two or three for more extensive testing 
under a federal mandate the state has until jan 1 1993 to 
designate and develop a site to store the lowlevel radioactive 
waste generated annually in new york by nuclear power plants 
hospitals and other facilities 
earlier this week protesters turned out in the hundreds to 
block the team for doing walking surveys at one of the allegany 
county sites thirtynine people were arrested 
last month 20 protesters were arrested during the siting 
commissions first visit to taylor in which the state team had to 
be escorted from the site by sheriffs deputies

the conservative government on friday accused 
local authorities controlled by the opposition labor party of 
deliberately inflating their spending in a bid to stir up 
antigovernment hostility over a new tax 
the conservatives on thursday prevailed in voting in the house 
of commons on legislation tied to the new tax despite defections 
within the party and warnings that it could lead to a tory defeat 
in the next general election due by mid1992 
the new tax is called the community charge by prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservatives and the poll tax by its opponents 
after a tax on individuals that was levied in the middle ages it 
goes into effect in england and wales in april it already is in 
use in scotland 
local authorities are funded partly by a grant from the 
government and partly by local taxation the new tax introduced by 
the government replaces the previous system of local taxation 
known as the rates 
the rates were levied only on property and were judged by the 
government to be unfair this was because the burden of the rates 
fell unevenly and many people legitimately escaped paying them but 
benefitted from garbage collection street maintenance and other 
local authority services 
the new community charge tax assessed against every adult in a 
house instead of on the building means bigger bills for many 
households millions of people such as adult offspring living at 
home who did not have to pay the rates will have to pay the new 
community charge tax 
the government says the average cost of the new tax per person 
will be 470 a year opponents say it will be more 
conservative party chairman kenneth baker in a radio interview 
friday with the british broadcasting corp said the government had 
evidence that local authorities controlled by labor were busy 
loading various items of expenditure on to their budgets 
he said their aim was to inflate their spending in order to push 
up the level of the new community charge tax and thereby increase 
resentment against the government 
he urged local authorities to cut back their budgets to reduce 
the cost of the new community charge tax to individuals 
but john cunningham labors campaigns coordinator said bakers 
accusations were a deplorable deception 
cunningham described the new community charge tax as the 
harshest most regressive and unfair tax imposed on the british 
people in almost 400 years 
in the commons on thursday night the government which has a 
100seat majority in the 650seat elected lower house of 
parliament managed majorities of 46 and 36 in two votes on issues 
related to the new tax 
the figures indicated that about 26 tories voted against their 
government the first time and more joined in the next 
the house voted 318272 and then 313277 to approve several 
motions on local government finance it endorsed a 37 billion 
central government grant to local authorities 
mrs thatchers original aim over the new tax was to bring home 
to people the high cost of electing highspending labor 
representatives to local authorities

hobbyhorses date back to ancient greece but 
remain a favorite toy for spaceage tots ask chuck sakolsky who 
was in charge of making and selling nearly 55 million worth last 
year 
the funny thing is that even though it is a rocketship world 
kids interest in horses has never gone away the hobbyhorse is as 
basic to the toy business as anything there is said sakolsky 
general manager of the wonder products inc factory in northwest 
louisianas bossier city near shreveport 
the wonder horse a heavyduty plastic horse molded in 
midgallop and held up by steel springs is a 20th century 
descendant of the hobbyhorse a stick with a horses head at one 
end 
toy historians have traced hobbyhorses to the time of socrates 
and to illustrations in a french book of hours in the 15th century 
no references to rocking horses are known before the 17th century 
but whenever they were invented they had become immensely popular 
by the 1800s 
wonder introduced the springmounted horse in 1939 sakolsky 
said and bouncing horses all but eliminated americanmade molded 
rocking horses from toy departments by the middle 1970s 
mostly whats out there are flat pieces of wood put together 
to look like a horse he said adding that most of todays molded 
horses on rockers are imported and are either expensive or cheap 
the wonder company plans to reintroduce its rocking horse this 
year capitalizing on growing nostalgia among parents and older 
people 
like the rocking horse wonder is coming back from almost 
nothing 
the company was founded in memphis tenn the move to bossier 
city came after it had been sold twice cbs inc the broadcasting 
and entertainment concern that owned a louisiana swingset company 
called gym dandy put the two together 
cbs got out of the toy business a couple years back they 
sold the company to some of its managers they really didnt have 
the wherewithal to keep it going sakolsky said 
basic or not the company went under rotocast plastic products 
inc of miami bought it for 25 million last year at a sheriffs 
sale and brought in sakolsky to run it 
weve doubled our business since 1987 and well double it 
again in 1990 he said 
sakolsky estimated that wonder sold about 3 million worth of 
toys in 1988 55 million in 1989 and probably will sell nearly 
10 million worth in 1990 he declined to give the number of toys 
sold but said the company has relationships with retailers ranging 
from large toy chains to small shops 
at one time we had close to 70 percent of the market he 
said in 1988 i think we had around 30 percent i believe well 
have 50 percent of the market by 1990 
the companys mainstay remains the springmounted horse which 
retails anywhere from 40 for a 28inch model suitable for a 2or 
3yearold to more than 100 
we have palominos roans pintos were coming out with a 
dapple gray he said 
sakolsky also has gone back through 40 years of catalogs to find 
products worth bringing back and has created a couple of his own 
last year the company introduced a horse of a brighter color a 
handpainted replica of a 1914 carousel horse painted in vivid 
merrygoround hues priced at 150 the same horse mounted on a 
brass pole and sold as furniture retails for up to 500 
it is the rollsroyce of the rideon horses said sakolsky 
i sort of think of these as grandmother horses because its the 
sort of thing a grandmother looks at and says gee thats what 
my grandchild has to have

while the auto industry has struggled with a 
series of muchpublicized problems in recent months manufacturers 
of heavy trucks have been traveling a similar rocky road 
that goes not only for the state of their businesses but also 
for the treatment their stocks have received on wall street 
in 1989 while the stock market as a whole was rising about 25 
percent the dow jones index of auto manufacturing issues dropped 
836 percent transportation equipment a group that includes 
several producers of trucks and truck parts fared worse with a 
981 percent decline 
so far in 1990 both groups have slumped further as the general 
market has come under pressure 
while the fortunes of car and truck makers might seem subject to 
many of the same influences they are two different types of 
businesses in the eyes of the analysts who follow them 
cars and light trucks commonly owned by the public carry the 
label of cyclical consumer goods sold in a marketplace whose mood 
is set by such forces as disposable income and consumer interest 
rates 
medium and heavyduty trucks by contrast are classed as 
capital equipment like factory machinery subject to the ups and 
downs of the industrial economy and of the confidence of business 
planners 
dealers truck sales in the united states began 1989 at a 
recordsetting pace and then fell sharply by late summer it was 
a huge swing said frank prezelski an analyst who follows the 
industry for deutsche bank capital corp in new york 
after a small net decline in sales for 1989 as a whole 
prezelski projects a further decrease of 10 percent to 15 percent 
in 1990 
at their present level we believe capital goods stocks 
reflect a recession or at least a meaningful downturn said 
karen ubelhart an analyst who follows the group for shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
although investment opportunities may be developing in some 
other types of equipment stocks she added we would continue to 
avoid the truck sector despite substantial stock declines we 
believe the chance of further earningspershare disappointment 
exists 
some of the stock declines have been substantial indeed 
lossplagued mack trucks which ubelhart characterizes as a 
troubled company in a troubled industry has lately traded at a 
little above 5 in the overthecounter market down from 1537 at 
its early1989 peak 
the stock of navistar a major truck producer traded on the new 
york stock exchange has fallen over the same period from near 7 
to around 4 
prezelski at deutsche bank agrees that the nearterm news for 
the industry is likely to remain negative 
but further ahead he sees a super cycle of the 90s 
developing that would produce a dramatic improvement 
after a slow start in 1990 we expect an acceleration of 
orders and shipments for several years culminating in a peak of 
demand probably in 1993 in both north america and europe 
prezelski says in a current report on the industry 
we believe that the early 1990s will see alltime record truck 
demand in north america and probably in europe due to the need to 
replace aging fleets in the united states and the repositioning of 
european truckers for the changing market of the post1992 period 
as european common market integration becomes a reality

whatever dance the stock and bond markets do in 
the days and weeks ahead chairman alan greenspan of the federal 
reserve board is likely to be calling the tune 
thats the nearunanimous expectation on wall street as 
greenspan prepares for a series of appearances before varous 
committees of congress beginning this coming week 
greenspan makes his capitol hill rounds at a time when hopes are 
dimming for any further moves by the fed to relax its credit policy 
if the outlook for the us economy alone were at issue 
analysts say the central bank would have a few problems pushing 
interest rates lower right now given a recent revival of worries 
about inflation 
but thats not the biggest deterrent bothering the private 
analysts and economists who make their living trying to guess the 
feds next move 
there also is the new variable of rising interest rates in 
japan west germany and other industrialized countries in some 
cases to their highest levels in several years 
this tends to exert upward pressure on us interest rates 
because yields on american securities must remain competitive to 
attract money from international investors 
if the fed should choose to fight that pressure many analysts 
believe the result could well be a dollar decline in foreign 
exchange 
but many observers see potential pitfalls as well in a 
restrictive fed policy such an approach theoretically increases 
the chances of a recession 
beyond that many believe it is a perilous approach in a period 
of shaky credit conditions in the junk bond market and at banks 
with problem loans on their hands 
during a period of financial distress many shocks can occur 
and overwhelm the financial markets said hugh johnson an 
analyst at first albany corp in albany ny 
the effect of these shocks can be aggravated by a federal 
reserve that is reluctant justifiably so to add liquidity to the 
markets each time a decline occurs 
there is a risk that the federal reserve will be seduced by 
declines in the dollar or intermittently strong inflation and 
economic data into keeping interest rates too high too long 
with such worries dragging it down the dow jones average of 30 
industrials dropped 1131 to 267790 in the past week 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 76 to 18756 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market rose 
116 to 44088 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 615 at 36608 
volume on the big board averaged 17226 million shares a day 
against 16192 million the week before 
for much of last year the fed generally was perceived to be 
facing a choice between two relatively straightforward options 
tightening credit to slow inflation or easing it to stave off 
recession 
the assignment was a juggling act to be sure but there were 
really only two balls that had to be kept in the air 
now many observers worry the central bank may be faced with 
more elaborate challenges some of which seem to be mutually 
contradictory 
it is hard to ascribe a universal cause to the problem of 
rising interest rates overseas said james grant editor of the 
biweekly grants interest rate observer 
inflation in japan oil prices notwithstanding is quoted at 
only 1 percent inflation in switzerland is 5 percent yet 
interest rates are up violently in both countries 
moneymarket yields have been rising in west germany where 
economic growth is sizzling but they have not been falling 
appreciably in the us where growth is vanishing 
the federal reserve would no doubt prefer to be easier 
grant said but the dollar and the domestic inflation rate tie 
its hands

the price of stocks at any one time has a lot to 
do with dreams the level of lassitude in the herd and the madness 
of the crowd but beneath all that are some fairly good yardsticks 
here are some of them at midjanuary provided by the 
statisticians at wright investors service which believes in the 
superiority of fact over opinion evidence over wishes and hunches 
and reason over all 
at midmonth the dow jones industrial average was down 5 percent 
from its jan 2 alltime high of 281015 points and standard amp 
poors 500stock index was off 63 percent from its high 
but these readings are dominated by the bigger companies while 
the dow jones industrial average and the sampp 500 still showed gains 
of nearly 20 percent over the past year the broaderbased value 
line composite index has risen only 5 percent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at about 337 in midjanuary the sampp 500 was priced at 145 
times estimated earnings for the previous 12 months or well below 
the peak of 21 in the summer of 1987 based on anticipated 
yearahead earnings the pe was 14 compared to 148 in 1987 
for comparison the sampps postwar average pe is 135 and its 
latest 20year average is 122 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the sampp industrial average at midmonth was priced at 76 times 
estimated 1990 cash flow about 20 percent higher than the 62 
pricecash flow multiple averaged over the past 20 years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at its peak in august 1987 the sampp 500 was priced at 24 times 
its equity value at midmonth the markets priceequity ratio is 
22 
comment from wright this multiple shows the market in its 
worst light since 2 times book value has time and again acted as a 
warning signal of an impending market correction 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the sampp industrial average was priced at 69 percent of estimated 
1990 sales a level almost onequarter higher than its 20year 
average of 55 percent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at midmonth the sampp 500 was priced at 226 percent of its 
average price level of the past 20 years in contrast corporate 
operating profits are running at just 156 percent of their 
19701989 average 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most stock market pricevalue measures are currently on the 
high side suggesting that any negative economic or corporate news 
is likely to produce a decline in stock prices 
since the outlook for operating profits remains weak it is 
reasonable to expect that the recent weakness in stock prices will 
extend further into 1990 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
economic growth in 1990 is likely to fall below consensus 
expectations with disappointing corporate earnings 
consequently until interest rates decline and economic 
fundamentals improve the stock markets negative trends are likely 
to persist wright expects bond market returns to exceed equity 
returns in the coming year 
that message went out last week from the bridgeport conn 
headquarters of of wright an international adviser to 
institutional investors and manager of large portfolios

few talkradio listeners in the new york area 
have not heard that bonds the mens clothing store is going out 
of business bonds owned by eagle clothes inc has bombarded the 
airwaves with ads touting its closeout sale 
the store is not alone in its predicament 
mattress discounter bed city shops inc fur retailer antonovich 
inc and the foxmoor womens clothing chain are among several 
retailers sorting out their finances under the supervision of 
bankruptcy court 
now that federated stores inc the renamed holding company for 
campeau corps us department store operations has been added 
to the list customers are wondering whether something is rotten in 
retailing 
the answer say analysts and store executives is not really 
some companies like campeau have peculiar problems and in 
general the shakeout is part of a natural winnowing process in 
the business 
campeaus fall from grace although the largest bankruptcy case 
in retailing history had almost nothing to do with the business of 
selling merchandise 
rather the campeau stores were victims of a love affair with 
leverage a legacy of the 1980s takeover obsession 
most of the blame belongs to robert campeau founder of the 
canadian real estate development company who borrowed heavily to 
finance his dream of presiding over a vast retail domain his 
advisers helped turn the dream into a nightmare by failing to 
foresee that the price he would pay was too dear 
the huge sums spent for federated department stores inc in 1988 
and allied stores corp in 1986 saddled the two with 77 billion 
in debt by september it became clear their profits couldnt cover 
their debt payments on jan 15 their fate was put into the hands 
of a cincinnati bankruptcy court judge 
but famous retail names in the campeau constellation including 
bloomingdales burdines jordan marsh and lazarus are not likely 
to disappear going the way of nowdefunct wt grant co 
industry experts make the point that in contrast to the campeau 
debacle grant failed in 1975 largely because of mismanagement 
campeaus stores which were profitable before being leveraged to 
the hilt to finance the mergers could emerge from their chapter 11 
restructuring possibly separated and under new ownership with 
minimal damage to their reputations 
avijit ghosh a marketing professor at the new york universitys 
leonard n stern school of business said recent developments in 
retailing reflect the overall business climate in which 
consolidations have sometimes required painful adjustments 
retailing has been going through a shakeout period but the 
industry as we know it isnt in its death throes ghosh said 
ten years ago everybody was talking about the fact that 
specialty stores would wipe out department stores ghosh said 
that has not happened department stores have held their own 
many department stores are thriving cashrich may department 
stores co has become the envy of the debtladen nordstrom inc is 
admired for its service while jc penney co inc dayton hudson 
corp and dillard department stores inc have become darlings of 
wall street investment analysts 
the star performers are following a principle of retailing they 
adapt to changing customer tastes and spending patterns those who 
cant change fall by the wayside 
we are a selfcleansing industry said william r howell 
chairman and chief executive officer of penney 
that means when women shun miniskirts stores must stock more 
midcalf lengths for instance or when consumers decide regular 
retailers charge too much stores must prove their prices are fair 
as sears roebuck and co is trying to do with its highly 
publicized switch last march to everyday low prices 
the success so far of sears pricing policy hasnt been 
impressive sears hasnt made itself distinctive enough to give 
people new reasons to shop there analysts say the giant retailer 
better make up its mind fast on an identity because betterfocused 
fastergrowing competitors are snapping at its heels 
some of the serious problems that do exist in retailing are 
symptoms of highly saturated markets what is going on in the new 
york metropolitan area is a prime example of how hard it is for too 
many stores to coexist without cutting each others throats 
stores such as bonds and bed city ran into trouble to some 
extent because they had too many competitors high rents didnt 
help matters 
i think the country is overstored many of us fell into the 
trap of opening stores everywhere but the customer ends up paying 
more money because somebodys got to foot the bill for the rent 
said jeremiah crowley president and chief executive officer of bed 
city 
in an industry where only the fittest should survive the 
publicity over the federated bankruptcy filing has drawn unfair 
attention store executives contend 
harwell w proffitt chairman emeritus of proffitts department 
stores based in alcoa tenn outside of knoxville said the 
situation makes him sad 
the public i think perceives that our industry has a 
problem he said while in new york attending a national merchants 
convention this past week retailers are getting a bum rap they 
dont deserve

this years super bowl telecast promises to have 
it all fast moves wild sounds emotional performances from some 
old veterans and the emergence of some newcomers and thats only 
in the commercials 
a car commercial that is to debut on the program next sunday has 
generated irate complaints that the ad promotes irresponsible 
driving a soft drink maker is using a new threedimensional 
sound technique in an ad which also reunites some people who 
appeared in a similar commercial nearly 20 years ago and being 
introduced is a new shaving instrument on which its creator already 
has invested 200 million and a decade in development 
for those who get bored with the game a beer company has come 
up with a football simulation for the second year pitting teams of 
helmeted beer bottles against each other in a contest played out 
over five commercials 
broadcasts of the national football leagues annual championship 
game which this year matches the san francisco 49ers against the 
denver broncos traditionally attract one of televisions biggest 
audiences of the year 
that has enabled the network airing the game to charge record 
amounts for advertising time on the show cbs is charging 700000 
for a 30second commercial in this years game up from 675000 on 
the 1989 broadcast 
advertisers view the broadcast as an opportunity to expose new 
products or advertising campaigns some use the sponsorship to 
motivate sales forces 
in super bowl broadcasts over the past decade apple computer 
introduced its macintosh personal computer with an orwellian ad 
that only ran once burger king found the goofy guy named herb who 
had never eaten its burgers and timex showed divers who unearthed a 
replica of its new watch beneath the red sea 
it is not just a highrated show its an event said 
arnold chase director of network operations from the ad agency 
bozell people make a date to watch the super bowl they dont 
plan anything else for that afternoon 
hal trencher vice president of sports marketing and sales for 
cbs sports said that despite the higher price all 28 minutes of 
commercials in this years game were sold by thanksgiving twenty 
different advertisers bought time in the game down from 30 last 
year the idea seems to be if you are going to be in it you 
dominate it with as much inventory as possible trencher said 
but the price has gotten too high for some advertisers 
including some who tried to capitalize on the popularity of the 
game anyway 
holiday inns inc based in memphis tenn spent more than 5 
million this fall on a campaign in which it selected a dozen people 
over a 12week period for trips to the super bowl in new orleans 
the company announced a winner a week in commercials on monday 
night football broadcasts on abc 
the winners will be at the game but holiday inns wont be on 
the super bowl broadcast its pretty costprohibitive for us 
said spokeswoman faith morris 
sterling drug co ran a promotion in nine cities this fall that 
it called the phillips milk of magnesia super bowl flush 
radio announcers asked listeners to name the activity most 
frequently performed during the super bowl those who called to say 
toilet flushing were entered in a sweepstakes with nine winners 
getting trips to the super bowl 
spokesman terry kelly said the company was not sure as of friday 
whether it could buy commercial time for the laxative on the game 
broadcast 
here are a few commercial highlights to look for in the super 
bowl broadcast 
fast moves nissan motor corp in usa plans to run a new ad for 
its nissan 300zx turbo that shows a driver fantasizing about the 
car outrunning a motorcyle a race car and a jet plane the 
industrybacked insurance institute for highway safety asked nissan 
and cbs not to run the ad it sends out just one message look 
how fast this car can go said institute president brian oneill 
nissan plans to run the ad anyway cbs declined comment 
wild sounds cocacola co is employing a new sound technique on 
a 60second commercial that reprises its 1971 ad featuring the 
song id like to teach the world to sing the technique 
generates sound that seems to be coming from many points in a room 
but it will be picked up only on stereo tv sets 
old faces cocacola reunites about two dozen people who 
appeared in the 1971 hilltop ad and shows their children 
joining them in song on the same italian hilltop where the first ad 
was shot pepsicola co has new ads with former pepsi product 
promoters michael j fox and san francisco quarterback joe montana 
anhueserbusch inc plays its bud bowl ii clash of beer bottles 
in several ads the budweiser team defeated bud lite last year 
newcomers gillette co will be introducing its sensor shaving 
product that it unveiled for the trade and the media last year and 
on which it is banking considerable resources toyota motor sales 
usa inc and general motors corps pontiac division also have new

when campeau corps department stores sought 
bankruptcy court sanctuary it didnt surprise wall street 
dealmakers who months ago saw the takeover business punctured by 
the failure of the companys record retailing buyout 
but campeaus latest problems seem to have driven another stake 
into the heart of the onceraging market for corporate buyouts 
bankers and investment firms have become even warier and 
its made investors more cautious said perrin long a 
securities industry analyst with lipper analytical services corp 
campeaus department store divisions federated department 
stores inc and allied stores corp filed for protection from 
their creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law 
the divisions have a combined 77 billion in debt much of it 
was borrowed through highinterest junk bonds to finance the 
purchases by campeau a canadian real estate developer of allied 
in 1986 and federated in 1988 
the takeover business which boomed in the 80s on the back of 
junk bond financing had to shift quickly into low gear after 
campeau revealed its troubles last september financing for several 
deals including ramada incs restructuring and coniston partners 
acquisition of tw services inc had to be revamped because of junk 
bond market gyrations 
furthermore big banks made cautious by the campeau mess refused 
to back a planned employeemanagement buyout of united airlines 
parent ual corp 
suddenly takeover financing appeared to be drying up wall 
street reacted by throwing a tantrum the collapse of the ual deal 
helped send the dow jones industrial average plunging 190 points on 
oct 13 
by the time federated and allied headed into court last week 
as many observers had expected would happen investment bankers 
and dealmakers already were coping with a changed environment but 
experts say the campeau filing has helped to subdue the buyout 
market further 
companies still will be bought and sold but finding bond 
investors will be difficult said long 
were in a transitional period because junk bond financing 
kind of has a dirty name he said 
norman weinger and michael metz two oppenheimer amp co analysts 
agreed in a report last week that mergers and acquisitions will 
involve bigger commitments of equity by buyers 
investors simply dont want to leave themselves open to the 
kinds of losses that campeaus creditors are facing 
investment firms were listed among campeaus biggest creditors 
the firms own or hold for others billions of dollars in federated 
and allied bonds and also put up millions of their own dollars for 
shortterm bridge loans to help campeau complete the federated deal 
first boston corp campeaus lead adviser in the federated 
deal could lose as much as 293 million according to fred garcia 
a first boston spokesman 
of that amount 43 million is from junk bonds owned by first 
boston garcia said the remaining 250 million is from a bridge 
loan 
first boston already has provided for any losses by charging 
them against its 1989 earnings garcia said adding that the 
company still showed a profit for the year 
another of campeaus more than 50750 creditors is painewebber 
inc which put up a 95 million bridge loan in the federated 
buyout 
a painewebber spokesman jeffrey taufield said the companys 
losses on the loan have been offset somewhat by fees it collected 
on the federated deal like first boston painewebber has adjusted 
its 1989 earnings to reflect any losses from the unpaid loan 
publicly the companies portrayed any losses as a fact of 
investment banking life 
we remain committed to the merchant banking business 
understanding as has been demonstrated very clearly that it is 
a high risk and high reward business said garcia 
painewebber officials will continue looking at opportunities 
in companies where they believe there is longterm potential 
taufield said 
but investment bankers have been chastened somewhat by the 
campeau filing 
it would be foolish for us not to consider current market 
conditions in any transaction said an employee at one wall 
street firm were not backing away but weve got our eyes 
open 
long predicted investment firms would move to reduce their 
exposure to bridge loans which generally are refinanced with bond 
sales the firms and other creditors are lining up to see how much 
they can recover from campeau 
long speculated the firms might get 20 cents back for each 
dollar they lent 
besides their own balance sheets dealmakers are also concerned 
that campeaus troubles may revive antitakeover sentiment in 
washington 
a year ago after the record 2453 billion leveraged buyout of 
rjr nabisco inc but well before campeaus problems became public 
congressional committees held hearings on possible ways of curbing 
debtfinanced buyouts 
house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks has already 
announced that his committee will hold hearings on the campeau 
filing and and look into the consequences of leveraged buyouts 
brooks said he feared the chapter 11 filing was only the 
beginning and that we will see the takeover trophies of the 1980s 
become the bankruptcy case names of the 1990s 
another itoldyouso came from sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
whose state is home base for federated and allied 
campeau represents the merger mania of the 80s when 
companies were more interested in devouring one another than 
producing a better product metzenbaum said 
congress was out of town last week and spokesmen for the senate 
finance and house ways and means committees said there had been no 
discussion of those panels holding new hearings in the wake of the 
campeau filing 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who last year testified that 
investors could be left holding the bag if debtladen buyout 
targets ran into trouble has not commented publicly on the 
campeau filing 
brady last year did not advocate any limits on takeovers saying 
market forces should be allowed to determine the future of the 
buyout process 
congress passed some minor restrictions on the deductibility of 
interest from debtfinanced buyouts last year jim jaffe an aide 
to ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski dill said the 
committee was unable to garner enough support for more substantive 
changes because of a lack of guidance from the bush administration 
that is really what people are waiting for jaffe said 
they figure its not worth doing anything if the administration 
isnt going to ultimately sign on

when atampt service conked out and waylaid 
millions of callers the phone giant scrambled to fix its image by 
apologizing and offering compensation when the top us health 
official blasted rj reynolds for peddling a new cigarette to 
blacks the company chastised him for paternalism 
two of the bestknown corporations in american business were 
responding to potentially enormous public relations crises this 
past week but their strategies couldnt have differed more 
i think its clear that atampt responded admirably by accepting 
criticism and trying to make amends for what was clearly a loss of 
service said gene kimmelman legislative director of the 
consumer federation of america a washingtonbased public interest 
group certainly rjr didnt respond the way atampt did 
on friday rj reynolds announced it was canceling its 
philadelphia test marketing of the new cigarette saying the 
companys efforts have been misrepresented by smoking opponents 
american telephone amp telegraph cos longdistance service has 
been touted by the company as the most sophisticated and reliable 
in the world when it abruptly failed for nine hours on martin 
luther king day the company faced one of the most serious public 
image problems since the breakup of the bell system monopoly last 
decade 
the company which has 80 million customers and dominates the 
longdistance market admitted a lapse in its standards apologized 
in fullpage newspaper ads and offered valentines day discounts to 
compensate 
i would give atampt high marks for facing up to the public and 
not trying to be secretive about it not trying to stonewall 
said james arnold president of chester burger co a new york 
consulting firm that specializes in public relations 
robert irvine a louisvillebased public relations consultant 
and the author of when you are the headline a book of advice 
to public figures on how to respond to crises said atampt shrewdly 
executed what he called classical crisis management 
once they knew they had the problem they disclosed it 
quickly he said now the valentines thing is a little cute 
but its their way of saying we want to do something 
irvine and other publicrelations experts said rj reynolds on 
the other hand may have caused itself an unwanted problem with a 
decision to manufacture and testmarket a new cigarette aimed at 
blacks called uptown 
blacks historically have suffered higher rates of cancer and 
other smokingrelated illnesses and rj reynolds strategy has 
been seized upon by antismoking groups as another example of what 
they call the tobacco industrys cynical and sleazy business 
practices 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan elevated the 
criticism this past week by traveling to philadelphia the key 
uptown test market and accusing rj reynolds of promoting a 
culture of cancer 
though the company declined to respond publicly it implicitly 
rebuked sullivan by saying it was disturbed by the sense of 
paternalism surrounding the controversy as though blacks were 
less able to choose to smoke 
what rj reynolds did was to base its strategy on marketing 
decisions consultant arnold said they ran afoul of public 
attitudes and it has made them appear to be out of sync 
in announcing the decision to cancel the test peter hoult rjr 
executive vice president of marketing said we regret that a 
small coalition of antismoking zealots apparently believes that 
black smokers are somehow different from others who choose to smoke 
and must not be allowed to exercise the same freedom of choice 
available to all other smokers 
before fridays announcement ahron leichtman president of the 
citizens against tobacco smoke a washingtonbased activist group 
said he saw rj reynolds behavior in the uptown controversy as 
the start of a possibly broad new front in the battle against 
cigarette consumption 
there are no ethics with these tobacco industry executives no 
ethics if they dont get 5000 new smokers every day they lose 
money he said this rj reynolds uptown campaign just may 
blow up in their face 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the campeau corp of canada owner of many famous us 
department store chains ranging from bloomingdales to burdines 
put them into chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors 
because of a crushing debt load it was the biggest bankruptcy 
filing in retailing history and one of the biggest casualties of 
the merger craze of the 1980s when campeau bought the stores with 
billions of dollars in loans the stores said they would remain 
open 
bank of new england corp one of the biggest banks in the 
northeast said it expects to report a loss of 105 billion for 
1989 because of bad real estate debt and was seeking to sell more 
than 6 billion in assets to stay solvent banking industry 
analysts interpreted the action as another grave sign of economic 
problems in new england and speculated that the federal government 
might have to take over the bank 
corporate profits and the governments latest data combined to 
show the economy remains weak and inflation hasnt gone away which 
left the stock and bond markets unsettled major computer makers 
reported sharply lower fourthquarter results boeing conrail and 
pillsbury were among prominent companies announcing job cuts the 
november trade deficit widened to 115 billion the worst showing 
in 11 months and inflation statistics showed the 1989 rate totaled 
46 percent the worst since 1981
