blackandwhite usually it means plain 
explicit uncomplicated 
but in his law office where the white pages of statute books 
were blackened by a firebomb morris dees somehow keeps seeing 
shades of gray 
dees the founder of the southern poverty law center and its 
chief counsel in trials that have destroyed ku klux klan 
organizations wants to understand his bitter adversaries even 
the ones whove tried to kill him 
a lot of these people have paranoid personalities bred from 
basically family problems when they were children he says 
theyre looking for love and affection 
if you look at a klan roster just about everybody can be 
an exalted something it makes them feel important 
white supremacists chafe at such cool analysis and at least 
three racist groups have put dees at or near the top of their hit 
lists a display case in his offices holds charred law books and a 
melted clock reminders of the 1983 firebombing by klansmen 
in a case set for trial monday in portland ore the 
53yearold white alabama lawyer is suing an organization called 
the white aryan resistance for allegedly inciting skinheads to 
fatally beat an african man there 
a lawsuit he brought in 1984 in the lynching of a black 
teenager in mobile ala resulted in a judgment that bankrupted 
the united klans of america the victims mother buelah mae 
donald received title to the klans national headquarters 
dees pursued the case with zeal and yet he wept along with 
others when one of the killers stood up at the end of the trial 
and begged mrs donalds forgiveness 
i just think once you come facetoface with this person you 
stalk and their families thats a catharsis that a lot of 
people go through he said 
morris dees grew up blondhaired and blueeyed in alabama 
cotton country 
when asked the source of the righteous anger that seems to 
underlie the law center he tells a story of his youth 
he was 16 and his father sent him to accompany a tractor driver 
on the farm a black man named clarence to a court appearance 
clarence had been charged with drunken driving but dees believed 
his story his car had a tie rod come loose and hed hit a 
concrete median and knocked himself dizzy 
the justice of the peace operated out of a store and during the 
trial dees said he never quit serving crackers and cheese 
and cokes across the counter 
guilty was the inevitable ruling 
the fine was over 100 clarence didnt have that kind of 
money dees said i dont know that kind of set me on wanting 
to become a lawyer 
dees graduated from the university of alabama and its law 
school while still a student he set up a lucrative birthday cake 
delivery service and later sold books by direct mail he and a 
partner sold the business for a reported 6 million 
dees next put his directmail skills to work raising millions 
for george mcgoverns democratic presidential campaign in 1972 
then used the mailing lists to appeal for help on his own project 
the fledgling southern poverty law center 
the center grew out of his determination that there was an 
enormous gap in legal defense in certain kinds of cases said 
julian bond a black civil rights leader from georgia who became 
the centers first board chairman 
what drives morris dees a very welldeveloped sense of 
outrage said bond now a professor and broadcaster in 
washington dc 
he knows the legal system can be used to right wrongs 
the law center which now has an endowment of 30 million and a 
4 million annual budget has taken on death penalty voting 
rights employment discrimination and other cases but is best 
known for hauling the klan and similar groups into court 
klanwatch a handful of investigators at the montgomery law 
center backed up by informants around the country produces a 
bimonthly intelligence report on hate group activities which 
is sent to 4000 police agencies 
white robes reflected by a fiery cross the fear reflected on 
black faces in the night in the intelligence report these 
stark events are reduced to column upon column of statistics names 
and dates blackandwhite becomes gray again 
it appears to be good solid information said lt robert 
mcculley of the memphis tenn police information is hard to 
come by you dont go into a bookstore and walk to the section 
labeled terrorism 
to enter the southern poverty law center a visitor climbs steps 
walled with stone past a granite monument to civil rights martyrs 
the front door is unlocked electronically and inside a 
receptionist sits at a video security system 
its a necessary bunker bond said if you do this work 
from the safety of new york city its one thing but if youre 
right in the heart of the beast a sensible person takes 
precautions 
and dees does he varies his route and schedule to and from 
work he avoids alleys 
demon dees louis beam a texas neonazi once shouted 
during questioning by his nemesis in one case beam challenged dees 
to a duel 
exorcising the demon with a simple gunshot apparently was not 
enough for members of the order which murdered denver talk show 
host alan berg 
the preliminary plan called for kidnapping dees interrogating 
him then flaying him peeling his skin off his body before 
killing him wrote kevin flynn and gary gerhardt in their book 
the silent brotherhood 
in an otherwise eventoned interview the only strong profanity 
came when the softspoken dees was asked if he doesnt expect one 
day to become another name on the law centers memorial 
man i dont want to be a martyr to anybodys expletive 
cause he said i didnt get into this thing for a cause 
the law center began with a variety of suits challenging 
unhealthy working conditions in textile plants representing death 
row inmates and others 
dees first went up against the white supremacists in 1979 
agreeing to represent a black marcher attacked during a peaceful 
demonstration in decatur ala clubbed by kkk counterdemonstrators 
the man tried to defend himself with a registered gun dees said 
an allwhite jury convicted him 
dees thought back to clarence and his day in court nothing 
had really changed 
but it was about to he filed a civil lawsuit against the 
klansmen 
evidence uncovered by klanwatch led to federal indictments 
against 10 klansmen and the suit ended in a settlement that among 
other things required the whites to attend a race relations class 
the class was taught earlier this year by the rev joseph lowery of 
the southern christian leadership conference who is black 
one of the klansmen dees said the day of the 
demonstration he had a club in his hand eleven years later 
hes standing there holding hands with dr lowery in a prayer 
and saying maybe i was misguided back then and we could 
have solved our problems in a different way

a white supremacist accused in a lawsuit of inciting skinheads 
to commit a racially motivated killing in portland ore says he 
was merely exercising his first amendment rights 
the suit which seeks damages from the group white aryan 
resistance or war and four individuals is merely a roundabout 
way of cutting off freedom of speech freedom of association and 
even freedom of assembly said tom metzger the organizations 
leader and a defendant 
the oregon office of the american civil liberties union plans to 
monitor the trial set to begin monday in portland 
plaintiffs lawyer morris dees calls metzgers claims 
baloney 
the civil case follows the criminal conviction of three 
skinheads in the 1988 beating death of mulugeta seraw a 
27yearold ethiopian who was living and working in portland 
seraws skull was fractured with a baseball bat 
dees montgomery alabased southern poverty law center sued on 
behalf of seraws estate in the past the center has won millions 
in judgments by suing hate groups and their leaders arguing that 
they are responsible for damage and injuries done at their behest 
just as a corporation can be held liable for employees actions 
the suit contends metzger and his son john have recruited 
skinheads to war in recent years and that through agents they sent 
to portland they provided a skinhead group called east side white 
pride with racist materials promoting violence against blacks and 
jews seraws killers were members of east side white pride 
further the suit which was joined by the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith claims war agents were in contact with the 
metzgers in fallbrook calif met with the skinheads and 
encouraged them to harm blacks 
the allegations of personal involvement are totally 
nonsense metzger said its something that mr dees has 
dreamed up 
dees said he has letters and phone records linking the metzgers 
and their agents in portland as well as a damning 
affidavit in it one of the agents michael barrett tells of 
taking five baseball bats to portland of keeping close contact 
with the metzgers and of meeting with east side white pride 
skinheads 
we told them to use violence if they got an opportunity and 
to be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy barrett said in 
the affidavit we were telling them what tom and john metzger 
told us to say

he arrived in time for the tidal wave of great 
society activism championed social concerns during the 
pennypinching reagan era and leaves as he came fighting for civil 
rights 
rep augustus hawkins 83 chairman of the house education and 
labor committee is a black man who never played racial politics a 
liberal who inspires affection among conservatives a courtly 
gentleman who rarely gives up or gives in 
the diminutive softspoken democrat is retiring this year after 
28 years in congress representing watts the los angeles 
neighborhood notorious for the riots that tore it apart in the 
1960s 
in the brave new capitol hill world of sound bites cynicism and 
big money the void left by hawkins departure may not be 
immediately obvious but there will be one ask any education 
labor or civil rights lobbyist the senior republican on his 
committee even rep tom downey who bested him in a recent dispute 
over how to channel childcare money to states and parents 
this institution is going to miss him terribly said downey 
dny 
he has been a relentless pursuer of social justice said 
michael edwards chief lobbyist for the national education 
association he has very deeply held principles and a great sense 
of mission and yet he was always able to bring people together 
hawkins basic philosophy that government must help its less 
fortunate citizens hasnt changed much since he was elected to 
the california assembly in 1934 
i truly believe every person in our country is entitled to 
equal opportunities if we give them those opportunities it will 
help everybody else thats good ordinary common sense he said 
in an interview last week 
the son of a britishborn adventurer who moved his family to the 
united states after exploring africa hawkins won his house seat in 
1962 he was the first black member from a western state and one 
of the first things he did was sponsor the equal employment section 
of the landmark 1964 civil rights act 
it was an early triumph in a congressional career that has 
spanned eras of plenty and parsimony pendulum swings in political 
thought and the inevitable mixture of achievements and 
disappointments 
chief among the latter was the 1978 humphreyhawkins full 
employment bill which put forth an admirable goal but lost a 
federal job guarantee before passage its been an outright 
failure in terms of implementation hawkins said bluntly no 
ones taken it seriously beginning with the carter 
administration 
the widely supported 1988 welfare reform law with its 
requirement that some recipients take jobs was another setback 
from hawkins perspective workfare is a punitive approach to 
forcing people off the rolls he declared on the floor 
it was an unusually harsh stand for a man who despite his 
enduring new deal concerns generally prefers compromise to 
confrontation 
hawkins grasp of political reality was put to the test in 1984 
when he became committee chairman amid rampant conservatism and a 
scarcity of domestic resources for the most part he adapted well 
building coalitions and inching ahead where possible 
if you only have a potato the only thing you can make is 
potato soup you cant make stew said bob mcglotten chief 
lobbyist for the aflcio under severe circumstances gus has 
done a tremendous job to make sure the educational systems in our 
society dont fall apart 
the kind of money hawkins wanted to spend on education and 
programs for disadvantaged children wasnt available but he 
settled for modest gains and was rewarded with nearunanimous 
passage of many major education bills 
there was far more contention in the labor area including 
protracted battles over raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing 
unpaid family leaves to workers but civility was always the order 
of the day 
we dont have any animosity we have differences said fred 
krebs manager of the us chamber of commerces labor and human 
resources department 
the same civility characterized hawkins relations with 
republicans on the committee who recently threw him a retirement 
party among his gifts was a homemade gavel to crack crabs and a 
gag picture of downey with a forged inscription that said i 
really enjoyed working closely with you 
im very saddened that he is leaving said rep bill 
goodling rpa the senior republican on hawkins committee he 
is one of the finest gentlemen ive ever met 
the two men had a close partnership with the chairman often 
testing his ideas on goodling and molding them to attract broader 
support 
if he doesnt agree with what im trying to do i try to find 
out why i know i will get the same disagreements from others 
hawkins said if i can make modifications well get something 
done if you are really interested in results why not be 
cooperative 
hawkins so lightskinned he is often thought to be white has 
never chaired the congressional black caucus and prefers to cast 
issues in economic rather than racial terms 
he has promoted education health care and nutrition for the 
needy and been instrumental in securing passage of many civil 
ights laws that opened up opportunities for minorities and others 
ironically as he leaves congress hawkins is once again trying 
to restore some of the protections he first fought for in 1964 
bush is threatening to veto this years kennedyhawkins civil 
rights bill although hawkins said he amended it 22 times to try to 
please the administration 
in some ways were back where we were hawkins said it is 
discouraging but not to the point where were giving up you have 
this ebb and flow in american politics you win a few and you 
lose a few by and large you try to be incremental in making 
advances 
when hawkins retires he wont vanish onto the chesapeake bay in 
his beloved fishing boat instead he intends to speak volunteer 
and organize on behalf of job corps head start and other programs 
he fostered in congress you dont have to be in elective office 
to make a difference hawkins said theres lots of things to 
do and in between ill do a little fishing

stan barbu is 3 and runs on his knees 
because the parents who abandoned him will not let surgeons fix his 
twisted legs he 50 other children in the orphanage are blind 
retarded or maimed 
they are the dregs of tens of thousands of abandoned or orphaned 
children who owe their plight to nicolae ceausescus obsession with 
population growth 
ten months after the commuist dictator was overthrown and 
executed no one knows just how many children languish in romanias 
78 orphanages and in dozens of hospitals the government says there 
may be 60000 in a total population of 23 million but other 
estimates range up to 100000 
what to do with them has yet to be decided some foreigners 
believe adoption is part of the answer 
stan is pale and fairhaired with a broad grin and bright eyes 
that make his crippling infirmities difficult to believe 
his fingers and toes are grown together and his legs bend inward 
in arcs so severe that he must walk and run on his knees he 
delights in showing visitors what he can do 
although stans parents abandoned him two years ago romanian 
law gives them the right to say whether he should have surgery 
they have refused and theres nothing we can do but watch him 
suffer unless the law is changed one of his nurses said 
ceausescu put to death last christmas day did not permit 
contraception and abortion was illegal with few exceptions women 
were required to have regular medical examinations to determine 
whether they were pregnant 
couples were encouraged to have at least four children each but 
ceausescus economic policies made it difficult to afford more than 
one 
parents abandoned tens of thousands of children to state 
institutions dr emil tomescu deputy health minister estimates 
no more than 3 percent of the children in orphanages actually are 
orphans 
of the approximately 800 romanian children diagnosed this year 
as having aids most are abandoned doctors said the fatal disease 
was spread among them through transfusions of infected blood given 
before romania had bloodscreening equipment 
tomescu said he expected legalized abortion new family planning 
centers and an improved economy to help ease the problem of 
abandoned children and orphans 
dr marghareta creteanu director of stans ward at the st 
catherine home for children in bucharest said the institution had 
admitted only 120 children since january about half the number of 
the same period in 1989 
barry child of orphanages trust a british organization that 
aids romania said his organization plans to buy some houses and 
put two to four children in each along with subsidized house 
parents helped by british volunteers 
this way fewer would have to live in orphanages and fewer 
might go to orphanages where he said conditions are absolutely 
terrible 
child said the most serious problem in orphanages was 
understaffing so we first want to provide groups to teach 
the romanian staff what to do to take good care of the children 
liz brown team leader of four young scottish nurses working as 
orphanages trust volunteers said a head nurse wont just jump 
in and help as we would in other countries and this 
exacerbates the problem 
the deputy health minister tomescu said the government 
recognized the problem and had decided to increase the nursechild 
ratio from 1 to 23 to 1 nurse for each 10 children 
mariana gheorghiu a nurse at the bucharest home said the new 
policy had not yet taken affect and things havent really changed 
much despite the efforts of some dedicated people who came here to 
help 
we have more milk and meat but there is a grave crisis in 
terms of personnel too many kids too few nurses she said 
as she spoke ms gheorghiu changed the diaper of gabriela who 
was 9 months old and dying of pneumonia 
st catherines is known as one of the best childrens homes in 
romania conditions there are poorer than in the west but far 
better than at other romanian orphanages 
david livianu director of the american center for romanian 
adoptable children said adoption is their only way out of a 
lifetime of struggle and indignity 
he took the photographs of 16 children with him to the united 
states in august and said adoptive parents awaited them in the 
united states livianu recently established an adoption center and 
his organization also has offices in the health ministry 
it can cost people up to 15000 to come here stay in romania 
for months and pay middlemen and lawyers en route to adopting a 
child he said we want to encourage people to instead 
make donations which can be used to buy muchneeded biomedical 
equipment such as incubators 
adoption was simplified in august by repeal of a law that 
required presidential approval of all adoptions under the new law 
adoptions are handled by local courts and need only the approval of 
childcare specialists and the childs parents if they are alive 
dan koch 36 the first american to adopt under the new law 
said he encountered very little bureaucratic delay or 
corruption 
i believe it would have taken longer and been more complicated 
back home said koch who works for the delaware state 
insurance commission 
he returned to his wife kathleen with 3yearold ioan now 
named john nicholas

his presumed ideology has been condemned on 
all sides his housekeeping has been derided and his neckties have 
been likened to dishrags but david souters friends say he is a 
man content with himself who wont change when he joins the supreme 
court this week 
goodness no thats like saying that gibraltar could be 
changed by a rainstorm said sen warren rudman rnh who 
preceded souter as state attorney general and sat behind him all 
through senate confirmation hearings 
david souters foundations and values have been built over 51 
years rudman said david hasnt changed at all and will not 
change at all 
the 51yearold ascetic bachelors life has been turned upside 
down in the past few months as he went from a littleknown regional 
jurist to one of the nations nine most powerful judges 
liberals and conservatives alike have voiced suspicions that 
hell vote against them on abortion civil rights and other social 
issues journalists have scrutinized everything from his suits to 
how hell cope with crime noise and high real estate prices in the 
nations capital 
but friends say he ultimately will be the softspoken 
eventempered man he always has been whether he is in weare nh 
or washington where he moved this weekend to get ready to join the 
court tuesday 
hes in a constant whirl of change but he will be himself 
wherever he is he is satisfied with who he is said concord 
lawyer tom rath souters deputy and successor as attorney general 
throughout a barrage of public and media scrutiny that began 
when president bush nominated him to the court july 23 souter 
remained polite almost courtly to anyone who begged a minute 
no trouble at all he told a apologetic reporter who called 
him at his weare farmhouse the phone number is still in the book 
the day he returned from senate judiciary committee hearings 
thats david souter rudman said he is without a doubt 
one of the most selfeffacing gracious people i have ever met 
but rath noted i think there were moments when that sort of 
basic nature of him good natured unfailingly courteous was 
tested 
some of those moments included an inventory of souters ancient 
kitchen appliances made by reporters peeking through his windows 
while he was in washington meeting senators 
souter joked about it when i think of all the things i should 
have left out if id known somebody was going to peek but ill 
never have that chance again 
in reality he was annoyed rudman and rath said 
he didnt like that and he felt people overstepped their 
bounds but i think he understood that for a few weeks or months 
hed have to endure it rudman said 
rath said friends tried to make sure that souters courtesy 
didnt allow people to take advantage of him 
i got angry a couple of times very angry the first friday he 
got back and he went over to see his mother said rath who 
acted as souters press agent and personal sentry after the 
nomination 
souter he recalled went in the back door of his mothers home 
in a concord retirement community immediately reporters converged 
on the front entrance 
the man hadnt even seen his mother and four or five reporters 
were knocking on his door i said look fellows come over here 
and interview me 
even wellwishing neighbors created some problems although 
souter and rath said their support was appreciated 
he told me the other day that he parked his car at the post

fabled in history but reviled today japans 
military leads the life of a secondclass citizen in this country 
where pacifism is not just a policy but a constitutional vow 
on sunday the self defense forces celebrated their 36th 
anniversary on a remote parade ground in asaka just north of 
tokyo the field bristled with the latest surfacetoair missiles 
tanks and other hightech weapons 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto reviewing the troops 
assured them the nation stood behind their noble and important 
mission 
but on the streets of japan soldiers are often harassed as 
tax thiefs and in parliament the militarys voice is rarely 
heard despite the governing conservative partys push for a more 
active military role overseas in response to the persian gulf 
crisis 
indeed custom dictates that top military officials are not even 
invited to government policymaking meetings an audience with the 
emperor an honor treasured by new cabinet ministers is denied the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
sentiment here is still very strong 45 years after the war 
people detest things military said masashi nishihara a 
professor at japans defense academy even today the sdf does 
not make its views known officially 
tomohisa sakanaka a defense expert at aoyama gakuin university 
said political leaders are very scared of treating the military 
in an honored way theyd prefer to disengage them from the 
mainstream 
the stated mission of the militarys 275000 ground sea and air 
forces is the defense of japan and its sea lanes to a distance of 
1000 miles ostensibly against communist aggression in the far 
east 
the militarys 1220 tanks 55 destroyers 14 submarines and 320 
jet fighters are prevented from going farther by japans 
constitution which bars the use of force overseas the 
allvolunteer force was formed as part of the us security 
umbrella which includes about 50000 troops stationed here 
but the militarys mission was conceived in 1954 when the cold 
war was in full swing and japan had barely recovered from the ashes 
of world war ii 
today this resourcepoor country whose status as the worlds 
no 2 economy rests on a farflung network of rawmaterial imports 
faces the task of redefining what constitutes its national 
security 
the danger at home has receded in the face of soviet 
liberalization and japans new detente with china and north korea 
and dangers abroad are growing as signaled by the crisis in the 
middle east from where japan gets 70 percent of its oil 
as a result parliament will be hotly debating this fall just 
how far selfdefense should extend prime minister toshiki kaifu 
has proposed sending a smal number of noncombat troops to the 
persian gulf under the un flag and he insists the people will 
listen to me about the need to expand the militarys mission 
hed better have a good explanation 
in museums and television dramas the brave samurai of 
yesteryear is as popular as ever but modern japan remains haunted 
by darker preoccupations the nations more than 1000 years of 
military rule when ruthless warlords dominated civil 
administrators and emperor alike 
it happened once too often in the 1930s militarists again rose 
up and broke free of civilian control shattering japans shaky 
first attempt at constitutional democracy the result was the 
catastrophic pacific war the only defeat suffered by this 
intensely proud nation on its own soil 
japans surrender brought a psychological aboutface the 
usimposed constitution that forever forbids war remains an 
unyielding article of faith here 
perhaps the wars most enduring legacy though was that it 
erased from many japanese minds the idea of military power as a 
necessity 
a whole generation of japanese has grown up without any 
consciousness of the need for military strength said minoru 
hirano a vice principal at a tokyo high school 
much of the blame for that can be laid on the nations 
educators who were deeply shamed over the role they played in 
indoctrinating prewar youth to die for the emperor said sakanaka 
the defense expert 
today the main slogan of the powerful nikkyoso teachers union 
remains never send our students to the battlefield again 
other asian nations still bitter over japans brutal wartime 
incursions into china korea the philippines and other countries 
view the slightest rumblings of japanese militarism with the same 
fear that europe has traditionally felt toward a resurgent germany 
almost all experts here agree that a newly aggressive japan is 
unlikely despite its ranking among the worlds top five military 
spenders at 31 billion a year 
surveys since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait consistently 
show that more than 60 percent of japanese oppose an overseas role 
for the military 
because weve been at peace for so long and no ones conscious 
of any danger none of us really think about the self defense 
forces at all said manabu watanabe 21 one of a group of 
college students munching hamburgers at a wendys in tokyo 
partly because of such sentiments officials acknowledge 
difficulty in annually recruiting 20000 new soldiers from japans 
population more than 120 million people thats despite starting 
wages of about 880 a month 21 percent higher than for us 
soldiers 
moreover some who join are stung by us criticism that japan 
has shirked its global responsibilities by sending money but few 
men to the persian gulf 
we cant be full members of the free world society said an 
officer quoted recently in local news if we do not shed blood to 
protect world security

japans peace constitution the focus of angry 
debate over the use of force overseas actually leaves plenty of 
room for dispatching troops to the persian gulf analysts say 
in fact they point out the existence of japans self defense 
forces already violates the constitution the real battleground is 
political not legal the experts say 
i dont think the constitution is a real constraint said 
seizaburo sato a tokyo university politics professor whats 
lacking is courageous leadership on the part of the prime 
minister 
the key constitutional provision adopted under the us 
occupation after world war ii is article 9 it states that the 
japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the 
nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling 
international disputes 
in order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph 
it continues land sea and air forces as well as other war 
potential will never be maintained 
in the 1950s the government decided that the ban on land sea 
and air forces was not intended to deprive the nation of its 
sovereign right to selfdefense the self defense forces were born 
today scholars say the ruling conservative party the liberal 
democrats could just as easily reinterpret article 9 to justify a 
combat role for prime minister toshiki kaifus proposed un peace 
cooperation corps particularly in view of other countervailing 
constitutional provisions 
the constitutions preamble for example says that japan seeks 
an honorable place in international society and its struggle 
against oppression 
if we pay attention to that clause it means we should be 
involved in united nations peacekeeping even if that means 
battle said masashi nishihara a professor at japans defense 
academy 
also article 2 of the un charter describes the principles 
of each member nation it says members should not resort to the 
threat or use of force it matches our article 9 
so if we are going to work under the un flag then such a 
collective security action does not constitute the threat or use of 
force he said 
nonetheless the government insists the peace corps will be used 
only for noncombat activities such as transportation critics say 
this is mostly because of heavy public opinion against an overseas 
military role and the ruling partys weakness in parliament

the sweeping victories by 
conservatives in last weeks congressional and gubernatorial races 
will mean bad news for the rain forest and its defenders 
environmentalists say 
conservatives won a large majority in last weeks voting and 
showed special strength in the nine states of the amazon region 
almost all are totally opposed to ecological concerns 
and rational development fernando gabeira a leader of brazils 
small green party said over the weekend 
the federal government sets most environmental policy but 
political scientist david fleischer of the university of brasilia 
noted almost all policy enforcement is carried out by local 
authorities if they show no interest in protecting the 
environment decisions at the federal level lose much of their 
impact 
rightwing candidates for governor won outright victories in 
three of the nine states and were headed for nov 25 runoffs in the 
other six 
only in two small states acre and amapa did proecology 
candidates even get to the runoffs 
candidates had to win an absolute majority to take a firstround 
victory 
in congressional races conservatives won at least 11 of the 13 
senate chairs at stake in the amazon region and all but a few of 
the house seats 
rightist populists have long dominated the impoverished region 
much of their success comes from support by major landowners who 
traditionally control the votes of the rural poor 
many voters also view environmentalism as an attempt to block 
economic growth and lock the amazon into perennial backwardness 
slashandburn techniques used by ranchers and farmers have 
already destroyed about 8 percent of the 2millionsquaremile 
wilderness according to government figures 
in amazonas the areas largest state incoming governor 
gilberto mestrinho favors widescale destruction of the rain forest 
to promote large mining and agricultural projects 
the states new senator amazonino mendes proposed handing out 
chain saws to settlers to speed the felling of the forest 
in neighboring roraima state both gubernatorial finalists 
openly opposed federal plans to remove thousands of gold miners 
from the territory of the yanomami indians the worlds largest 
remaining primitive tribe 
the miners illegally search for gold diamonds and other 
minerals on indian land armed clashes and imported diseases killed 
about 1500 of the tribes remaining 9000 members in the past 
three years 
the favorite in roraimas gubernatorial race is romero juca now 
on trial for illegally authorizing logging on indian land when he 
was chief of the national indian foundation in the early 1980s 
the elections in roraima could spell the end for the 
yanomami fleischer remarked 
in para state the runoff pits antiecology candidates jaber 
barbalho and sahid xerfan 
para has been the site of repeated clashes between indians and 
miners miners have dumped about 600 tons of mercury from gold 
prospecting into the tapajos river 
we have no preference in para gabeira said neither 
possible winner will defend the indians or the amazon 
big farmers are blamed for most of the violence plaguing the 
region more than 1000 peasant activists were killed in land 
conflicts in the past decade 
the rev ricardo resende of the pastoral land commission said in 
a phone interview from para state the new governors are well 
known and most have never demonstrated any interest in protecting 
the regions poor small farmers will continue to be expelled from 
their land 
his commission is linked with the roman catholic church 
gabeira said the only bright spot was in acre home to thousands 
of rubber tappers where jorge viana of the proenvironmentalist 
workers party won a spot in the second round 
his strength is largely attributed to the legacy of 
worldrenowned unionist and ecologist chico mendes a workers party 
activist murdered in 1988 mendes alleged killers are going on 
trial oct 25 and the publicity could boost vianas campaign 
there was another note of encouragement to the rain forests 
advocates sunday contained in an article in the newspaper jornal do 
brasil 
it reported that the area of the amazon rain forest destroyed by 
fires in 1990 was down considerably from last year data compiled 
by brazils national institute of space research showed overall 
destruction may be down by as much as 50 percent the newspaper 
said 
institute president marcio barbosa was quoted as saying that the 
space satellite that monitors the amazon has been crucial to 
efforts to prevent further damage

the sands of the saudi desert are chewing 
through helicopter parts much faster than expected causing 
problems for us antitank apaches and cobras army officers say 
the helicopters belong to the 24th mechanized divisions air 
brigade of fort stewart ga which holds some of the most forward 
positions of the growing us force in northeastern saudi arabia 
the helicopter crews have trained in californias mojave desert 
but despite similrities in the terrain the sands of the mojave 
did not scour as the saudi sand does officers and maintenance 
personnel said 
the 24ths helicopters include the hightech ah64a apache and 
ah1 cobra gunships oh58 kiowas used to scout enemy tank 
formations uh60 blackhawk and uh1 huey transporters and those 
fitted for electronic warfare 
despite the maintenance burden at least 70 percent of the 
aircraft are operational at any given moment said the brigade 
commander col burt tackaberry 43 of jacksonville fla 
he said the rate had dipped into the 60 percent range when the 
brigade first moved into its desert camp 10 days ago but he said 
it would not go that low again after flying hours were reduced 
defense department ground rules prohibit mentioning exact 
numbers or locations 
tackaberry said the brigade does not have its full supplies of 
spare parts yet but he was confident it could start fighting a war 
if necessary the us force is facing off iraqi troops following 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of neighboring kuwait 
the colonel said the apaches have so many backup systems three 
radio systems for example and two types of night vision equipment 
that the failure of one would not knock the helicopter out of 
combat 
but desert sand is wearing out the surface of the rotary blades 
also fine sand sucked into the hot engines can melt into glass 
that chips and ruts internal parts in the turbines 
sand clogs the starting valves and it gets between the twin 
panes of the windshield reducing visibility 
the sand is at work and so are we said warrant officer 
richard l paradis 38 of pooler ga a member of one of the 
brigades two maintenance teams 
we go through a lot of main rotor blades a lot of tail 
blades he said in the desert were using about five times as 
much 
the main engines have to be pulled and cleaned after every 250 
hours of flying time something that does not happen under usual 
conditions 
staving off wear and tear on the machines requires all sorts of 
ingenuity 
coats of rubbery epoxy paint are to be added to the front edge 
rotary blades to slow the corrosion the maintenance teams are 
experimenting with ways of keeping dust out of the engines such as 
fitting the engines with the tough flat scouring pads used in many 
kitchens 
navigation is also a problem the crews who trained in the 
mojave are having to learn from scratch how to navigate in the 
featureless terrain south of the border with occupied kuwait 
occasionally you see a few dried up lake beds and camel 
herds said capt kelly marunde 30 head of air traffic control 
and the sole female company commander in the aviation brigade 
but the herds move and the sand blows so you cant really 
rely on anything being there the next day

chancellor franz vranitzky a socialist 
is trying to stem the rising fortunes of a rightofcenter opponent 
and the green movement in national elections sunday 
the latest polls showed an unprecedented 23 percent of voters 
unsure which party they prefer raising great uncertainty as 
austrians began casting ballots at 7 am the last voting stations 
close at 5 pm noon edt 
voter surveys indicate the most likely outcome is that the 
governing socialistconservative coalition will remain in control 
of parliament the coalition consists of vranitzkys socialist 
party and the conservative austrian peoples party which is led by 
vice chancellor josef riegler 
however the two major parties stand to lose seats to the 
rightofcenter freedom party of populist joerg haider and to a 
lesser extent the environmental green alternative party 
haider governor of the southern carinthia province has won 
considerable popularity for his often witty remarks he has often 
resorted to abusive language in criticizing the leaders of the 
governing coalition and their policies 
the 53yearold chancellor has rejected any possibility of a 
coalition with haider who is accused by many socialists of 
appealing to advocates of rightist policies 
some conservatives are considering the possibility of forming a 
rightofcenter coalition with the freedom party however riegler 
said he does not want to cooperate with haider 
in the 1986 elections the socialists gained 80 seats the 
peoples party 77 the freedom party 18 and the greens 8 
on sunday a total of 5628913 people including for the first 
time 21232 austrians living abroad were registered to vote for 
the 183 parliamentary deputies 
haider said he hopes the freedom party wins between 25 and 30 
seats at the expense of the two major parties the greens also want 
to double their seats 
the tiny communist party and a few other small political parties 
have virtually no chance of gaining seats 
the election campaign was generally lackluster though marked by 
some namecalling major party leaders refrained from sharp 
attacks possibly with a view toward maintaining the governing 
coalition 
no single issue predominated candidates debated immigration and 
austrian efforts to win membership in the european community the 
european nations working to integrate their economies

the ulysses probe sprinted through 
space sunday on its fiveyear trip to study the sun while the 
discovery astronauts who dispatched the craft turned their 
attention to scientific experiments 
ulysses an atomicpowered spacecraft released from the shuttle 
saturday was traveling about 34130 mph the fastest speed ever 
for a manmade object 
its outbound and doing well flight director gary coen 
said 
discoverys five astronauts got up early sunday morning to begin 
a day of experiments that included lighting a small controlled 
fire growing plant roots and testing a system in which shuttle 
cameras are maneuvered by voice commands 
mission control awakened the crew with a song written and 
performed by boeing aerospace amp electronics co employees as a 
tribute to the successful deployment of the probe partially 
boosted into space by a boeingbuilt rocket 
sailing along sailing along flying to explore the galaxy 
the aerospace workers sang 
no problems with the space shuttle were reported coen said 
everybody is real happy that things are going so smoothly he 
said 
saturday was a bannerday for the space agency which has 
suffered through months of frustrating problems with its space 
shuttles and the flawed hubble space telescope 
first the discovery thundered into space just 12 minutes behind 
schedule a minor weather problem and a lastminute technical 
glitch caused the delay of the first shuttle launch in nearly six 
months 
six hours later the crew deployed the ulysses sun probe the 
primary goal of the mission 
after a roundabout journey ulysses is scheduled to pass over 
the suns south pole in 1994 then curve over the north solar pole 
the suns poles cannot be seen from earth and have never been 
examined closely by scientists 
discovery is scheduled to land wednesday in the california 
desert the mission wasnt affected by the shutdown of many federal 
agencies because funds for the mission already had been set aside 
officials said 
the shuttle commander is richard n richards and the other crew 
members are pilot robert d cabana and mission specialists william

sen j bennett johnston overcame a strong 
challenge from white supremacist david duke and won a fourth term 
in office without the need for a runoff 
my friends i am here to tell you tonight we did it 
johnston shouted to supporters after saturdays victory which 
calmed the fears of louisianas political establishment democratic 
and republican alike 
in final unofficial results johnston a democrat had 749552 
votes or 54 percent and duke a republican had 605681 votes or 44 
percent two minor democratic candidates divided the remainder 
nick accardo had 21709 votes and larry crowe had 14472 votes 
dukes strong candidacy had rattled leaders of both parties and 
prompted the endorsed republican candidate state sen ben bagert 
to drop out of the race last week out of fear that he could force a 
runoff between duke and johnston 
duke a state representative is a former grand wizard of the ku 
klux klan although he claims to have reformed since his klan days 
he has been successful in mainstream politics by preaching civil 
rights for white people and attacking affirmative action and the 
welfare system 
duke appearing before supporters refused to concede and said 
johnston would not get the majority needed to avoid a runoff he 
threatened a court fight over the issue of whether absentee ballots 
cast for bagert before he dropped out should be counted 
all i can tell you is that we have not yet begun to fight 
duke said 
also saturday louisiana voters overwhelmingly approved a state 
lottery and new orleans moved closer to electing its first black 
congressman since reconstruction state sen william jefferson and 
marc morial the son of former mayor dutch morial headed a field 
of 12 for a nov 6 runoff in the 2nd district replace retiring rep 
lindy boggs the only white house member to represent a majority

his presumed ideology has been condemned on 
all sides his husekeeping has been derided and his neckties have 
been likened to dishrags but david souters friends say he is a 
man content with himself who wont change when he joins the supreme 
court this week 
goodness no thats like saying that gibraltar could be 
changed by a rainstorm said sen warren rudman rnh who 
preceded souter as state attorney general and sat behind him all 
through senate confirmation hearings 
david souters foundations and values have been built over 51 
years rudman said david hasnt changed at all and will not 
change at all 
the 51yearold ascetic bachelors life has been turned upside 
down in the past few months as he went from a littleknown regional 
jurist to one of the nations nine most powerful judges 
liberals and conservatives alike have voiced suspicions that 
hell vote against them on abortion civil rights and other social 
issues journalists have scrutinized everything from his suits to 
how hell cope with crime noise and high real estate prices in the 
nations capital 
but friends say he ultimately will be the softspoken 
eventempered man he always has been whether he is in weare nh 
or washington where he moved this weekend to get ready to join the 
court tuesday 
hes in a constant whirl of change but he will be himself 
wherever he is he is satisfied with who he is said concord 
lawyer tom rath souters deputy and successor as attorney general 
throughout a barrage of public and media scrutiny that began 
when president bush nominated him to the court july 23 souter 
remained polite almost courtly to anyone who begged a minute 
no trouble at all he told a apologetic reporter who called 
him at his weare farmhouse the phone number is still in the book 
the day he returned from senate judiciary committee hearings 
thats david souter rudman said he is without a doubt 
one of the most selfeffacing gracious people i have ever met 
but rath noted i think there were moments when that sort of 
basic nature of him good natured unfailingly courteous was 
tested 
some of those moments included an inventory of souters ancient 
kitchen appliances made by reporters peeking through his windows 
while he was in washington meeting senators 
souter joked about it when i think of all the things i should 
have left out if id known somebody was going to peek but ill 
never have that chance again 
in reality he was annoyed rudman and rath said 
he didnt like that and he felt people overstepped their 
bounds but i think he understood that for a few weeks or months 
hed have to endure it rudman said 
rath said friends tried to make sure that souters courtesy 
didnt allow people to take advantage of him 
i got angry a couple of times very angry the first friday he 
got back and he went over to see his mother said rath who 
acted as souters press agent and personal sentry after the 
nomination 
souter he recalled went in the back door of his mothers home 
in a concord retirement community immediately reporters converged 
on the front entrance 
the man hadnt even seen his mother and four or five reporters 
were knocking on his door i said look fellows come over here 
and interview me 
even wellwishing neighbors created some problems although 
souter and rath said their support was appreciated 
he told me the other day that he parked his car at the post 
office to mail a package and it took him 45 minutes to get from his 
car to the window rath said people are warm and friendly and 
such but it gets wearing 
everyone in souters circle are happy that the attents 
abating 
i think theres a feeling of enormous relief rath said 
this is a man who likes his work and the fact that he hasnt 
been able to work for the last 2 months has been hard 
once he goes back to work hell stay there eschewing the 
washington social scene that already has chosen him one of its most 
eligible bachelors rudman predicted 
he will be here as he was in new hampshire essentially 
extraordinarily hardworking he said 
if anybody in this city thinks that those phonies who send him 
those power invitations will get their hands on him they are in 
for one terrible disappointment said rudman whose dislike for 
the social whirl is well known 
as of monday at 5 pm when souter will take the first of 
two oaths of office rudman said he will essentially disappear 
as a person who is seen in the scene here in this city

sunday again evading police pursuit to speed away with his loot 
the thief has been operating in more than 20 israeli towns 
robbing banks of a total of about 150000 he has left no clue and 
no description just a fingerprint that draws a blank in the 
police computer 
the thief who has been nicknamed bikerbank in hebrew 
always uses the same method he strikes between 10 am and noon 
and robs the teller nearest to the bank door firing one shot in 
the air from his 38 smith and wesson pistol 
he is about six feet tall wears cowboy or army boots has blond

a newspaper reported sunday that an 
iranian envoy has arrived in beirut to prepare for the release of 
anglican church envoy terry waite in the next few days 
the report by the conservative addiyar could not be confirmed 
the paper is not known to have had special insight into the hostage 
issue 
but the report came amid mounting speculation that one or more 
of the four britons missing in lebanon could be freed soon iran 
and britain restored diplomatic relations on sept 27 
on saturday lebanons leading newspaper the independent 
annahar daily said that waite and a number of foreign 
hostages were expected to be released this week 
arab sources in damascus syrias capital said sunday that the 
syrians are making strenuous efforts to free some of the 13 
westerners missing in lebanon most are believed held by 
proiranian shiite moslem militants 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said syrian 
foreign minister farouk sharaa is trying hard to resolve the 
issue but has been encountering unexpected obstacles 
he did not elaborate but noted that sharaa is expected to meet 
soon with iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati to discuss 
the issue they met last week at the united nations in new york 
speculation also has been fueled by expectations that britain 
and syria will soon restore relations britain broke off ties in 
october 1986 after syrian intelligence was implicated in a plot to 
bomb an israeli airliner at londons heathrow airport 
addiyar said the unidentified iranian official flew into beirut 
saturday carrying an algerian passport 
secret talks have been held in the last two months and 
resulted in agreement on the release operation as well as the final 
touches and details the report said it said the envoy was 
assigned to supervise the release which would come in the next 
few days 
in london the british foreign office said there was nothing to 
the report and reiterated british policy that it will not negotiate 
to get hostages out 
britain and iran restored diplomatic relations after a 19month 
break triggered by the publication of british author salman 
rushdies novel the satanic verses many moslems say the book 
blasphemes islam 
addiyar said waites release was expected to be the preface 
to releasing all british hostages in lebanon the other missing 
britons are journalist john mccarthy retired pilot jack mann and 
writer alec collett 
it said the agreement to release waite involved a 10 million 
fee to the forces who kidnapped him 
waite 51 disappeare jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel in 
moslem west beirut for a meeting with representatives of islamic 
jihad or islamic holy war the proiranian shiite moslem faction 
is believed to hold american hostages terry anderson and thomas 
sutherland 
no group claims to have kidnapped waite but a former hostage 
irishman brian keenan said after he was released by shiite captors 
in august that waite was held with him for a while 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of the 13 western hostages in lebanon 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani apparently has been seeking 
to free the hostages in his drive to improve relations with the 
west following the june 1989 death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
he has been opposed by radicals in his own government

as us forces were building up in the 
persian gulf the cruiser uss lasalle sent an urgent message to 
saufley field in the florida panhandle 
the flagship of operation desert shield needed books 
the lasalle wanted information on middle east culture customs 
history and even artists and authors recalled library technician 
dot bibee the navys fourwoman library services division had a 
shipment on its way in 24 hours she said 
whenever we hear from a ship thats when we jump said 
division head marge homeyard 
titles sent to the lasalle included saddams iraq iraq in 
pictures women at work in the gulf and images of 
bahrain 
this is a busy time for military librarians who are jumping to 
meet a huge demand for books for us troops in the persian gulf 
not all requests are as specialized as the lasalles the military 
waiting game in the gulf has left soldiers and sailors with plenty 
of time to read and their tastes take in the full range of a 
librarys shelves 
among the most popular are technomilitary yarns by tom clanc 
whose works include hunt for red october and red storm 
rising and stephen coonts author of flight of the intruder 
horror stories by stephen king and westerns by louis lamour also 
are popular and the increasing number of women in the military has 
created a demand for novels by romance authors such as danielle 
steel 
paperbacks are preferred 
they are the goanywhere type of books said willie quinley 
another library technician stash one in your back pocket and you 
can go to the john with it its kind of hard to do that with a 
hardback 
shipboard libraries even include childrens books military 
parents can record themselves reading the stories and send the 
tapes to their children 
shipments for the persian gulf are screened to avoid sending 
books that might offend the conservative host countries by being 
too violent or sexy including covers with pictures of scantily 
clad women 
to the extent possible we are sanitizing homeyard said 
that however was not possible for ships that sailed into the 
region with existing libraries 
to some extent we have our fingers crossed we are not going 
to have an international incident over a library book homeyard 
said 
the library supply operation is part of the naval education and 
training program management support activity at saufley a former 
flight training auxiliary base a few miles from the pensacola naval 
air station 
in addition to ships the agency supplies books to 147 navy and 
27 marine corps shore libraries and 343 units at remote sites 
the air force and army have similar library functions at 
randolph air force base texas and arlington va the services 
have been working together to supply books to their troops in the 
persian gulf 
navy library activities in the gulf are headed by lt cmdr gary 
simons who like most library officers is a chaplain 
simons sent a message sept 23 from bahrain to report that 
desert shield sailors were enjoying their books but that his supply 
was exhausted his message like the one from the lasalle received 
immediate attention 
the division scrounged through its own stash of mostly review 
books to ship 23 boxes it arranged for 15 more from the aircraft 
carrier uss kitty hawk which is being overhauled in philadelphia 
and is now overstocked with books quinley said 
an illustrated book on body building male and female was 
deleted 
not only were the models scantily clad it had venus the 
statue of the naked lady and a male statue also quinley said 
it may be art but they might not understand if it got in the 
wrong hands

the royal government of kuwait 
shielded by saudi guards and served by an army of room service 
waiters meets regularly on the affairs of a state its iraqi 
occupiers claim no longer exists 
its cabinet room is a plushly appointed suite in the al hada 
sheraton a mountaintop resort that is temporarily out of business 
as a hotel 
the governments records and reports the apparatus of 
displaced rulers struggling to keep their emirate together from a 
distance are stuffed in dressers back rooms and broom closets 
in stark contrast to the foreign refugees from kuwait stranded 
in jordanian desert camps kuwaiti officials pad about in cooled 
air on thick carpets soothed by plaintive arabic melodies from 
speakers 
on a recent afternoon a lebanese merchant lugged in a suitcase 
full of gold swiss watches for idle customers it was clear that 
time hung heavily on their hands 
men in snowy white arab headgear and shirtgowns float about the 
quiet corridors in between flurries of activity they sip coffee 
dine elaborately or nap at length 
about 300 kuwaiti officials and family members live in bungalows 
on the grounds unruly children scamper about colorful gardens 
inside high fences offices and staff rooms are in the sevenstory 
main building 
hotel shops are closed except for the bangladeshi scent man in 
the lobby in flasks out of 1001 nights he sells 500 aromas 
along with fragrant resins exotic wood chips and paris perfumes 
try this he said slashing a browsers hand with pungent 
oil its called queen of the night 
not even saudi police cars get past the barrier at the front 
gate without a coded pass and a rigorous check authorized visitors 
surrender their passports for a green badge which in turn is 
traded for a pink badge 
a thorough but goodnatured security chief named mohammed 
referring to the iraqi invasion jokes with foreigners that they 
will be free to leave whenever they wish 
once inside visitors are showered in courtly hospitality and 
prodded for news 
during a recent interview sheik saad al abdullah al salim 
alsabah the kuwaiti crown prince and prime minister punctuated a 
reporters queries with questions of his own 
seven neat stacks of regional newspapers lay at anyones 
disposal in the lobby but most information filters in slowly from 
the dwindling number of kuwaiti refugees who make it out of their 
homeland 
few officials are anxious to be named in news dispatches for 
fear their relatives back home might suffer 
pointing to a colleague one kuwaiti said he just found out 
three days ago that his brother was carried off to baghdad to work 
as a technician for the iraqi air force i dont think he wants to 
talk about it 
the information ministry is on the first floor obvious from the 
stacks of postersized photos in the hallway 
one is the celebrated scene of saddam hussein patting a visibly 
uncomfortable british hostage boy next to it a poster shows adolf 
hitler caressing a pleased german youth of similar age 
nearby several dozen different photos of iraqi atrocities and 
damage to kuwait are piled high on a counter but there are few 
takers 
after a month in the hotel spirits are still high assured 
hamad jabal alsabah a ministry official and son of the prime 
minister maybe well be back in kuwait by the end of the 
month 
but some others seemed dubious more than one kuwaiti has noted 
the irony in the housing advertisement displayed in each of the 
hotels elevators youll love the life at the sheraton

former ku klux klansman david duke conceded 
sunday that us sen bennett johnston was reelected in the 
louisiana open primary and said he would not challenge the outcome 
in court 
im here to concede the election to bennett johnston but im 
not going to concede or relinquish my commitment to the principle 
of equal rights for every american duke a firstterm state 
representative told a news conference 
in complete but unofficial returns form the saturday voting 
johnston had 54 percent of the vote and duke 44 percent 
as the vote was counted duke had said he would ask for a court 
order to challenge absentee votes that were cast before ben bagert 
the official republican candidate dropped out on thursday under 
state law any votes for bagert were not counted after he dropped 
out 
though he backed off on the idea of filing his own challenge 
duke said sunday that his organization would support any individual 
who wanted to pursue the matter in court 
well help people who feel their right to vote has been 
abrogated he said well help them pursue that if they so 
desire but im trying to do as bennett johnston said and kind 
of heal at this point 
i want to see the state together i want people to get behind 
bennett but i want them to make sure that bennett pursues policies 
that are good for the people of louisiana 
bagert dropped out and encouraged his backers to vote for 
bennett after polls showed him running a distant third in the race 
several republicans in the us senate also took the unusual step 
of backing democrat johnston in the primary saying they didnt 
want the former klansman to force johnston into a runoff 
under the states open primary candidates all run in one 
primary regardless of party if no one candidate gains a majority 
of the votes a runoff is held among the top two votegetters

republican rep lynn martin has portrayed 
illinois sen paul simon as a taxhappy liberal and a 
stringpulling washington insider but neither approach appears to 
have helped much in her race to unseat him 
martin was trailing simon by a 2to1 margin in a recent poll 
and her underfinanced campaign hasnt run television ads for more 
than a week 
with the nov 6 election closing in she has been unable to 
catch simon even though the former crimefighting newspaper editor 
has been tarnished by questions about his conduct in two cases 
that he called a san francisco bank urging officials to 
negotiate a settlement with michael ballis a developer and simon 
fundraiser involved in a dispute over a construction project 
and that he wrote to the higher education assistance 
foundation on behalf of a nowclosed cooking school whose owner 
then made two 1000 inkind contributions to simons campaign 
heaf a guarantor of the governmentbacked loans was asked to 
lower the monthly payments 
on his intervention with the bank simon 61 said he was merely 
helping a constituent and trying to avoid court costs martin 
countered with a tv advertisement that used the word fix 
simon accepted blame for the cooking school incident saying his 
staff used bad judgment in dealing with the cooking school 
operator 
martin stoked the coals saying how many more cases like this 
are there 
still a poll released last week showed simon favored by 60 
percent of those surveyed with martin supported by 31 percent the 
sept 23oct 1 survey for wlstv in chicago showed 9 percent 
undecided and had a 3 percentage point margin of error 
political analyst charles cook says martin needs substantially 
more positive advertising than has been done thus far and will 
still have to go back on negative ads in a big way again 
whether she has the money to do both in sufficient quantities 
is a very good question cook said 
as of june 30 simon had raised 57 million compared with 34 
million for martin the next campaign finance reports are due next 
week 
when she announced her candidacy last year martin 50 tried to 
paint simon as a taxloving liberal who had abandoned the state to 
run for president less than three years into his first term he 
missed nearly 60 percent of senate votes in 1987 while he sought 
the democratic nomination 
illinois deserves better she said 
with president bush and congressional leaders embracing higher 
taxes she emphasizes her antitax stance on the campaign trail 
muggers in pinstriped suits she said of those pushing a 
500 billion taxandspending cuts proposal that was defeated by 
the house last week theyre back at your pocketbook again 
but it has been rough going for martin 
simon has the support of most womens groups and those that are 
not in his camp are staying on the sideline instead of aiding 
martin both candidates back abortion rights 
martins integrity also is under attack simons campaign said 
she should return nearly 60000 in campaign contributions and 
speaking fees to sundstrand corp and its executives 
sundstrand which is in martins northwest illinois district 
pleaded guilty to defrauding the pentagon in 1988 and was barred 
from government defense work for a few months 
martin once told an interviewer that shes to the right of 
atilla the hun when it comes to government spending simons camp 
has used that against her finding votes and public comments to 
portray the former teacher as a foe of schools 
a simon tv ad mentions martins votes against medicare 
a member of four senate committees simon has promoted his 
sponsorship of the governments literacy program and his work on 
behalf of college students who need federal aid

the writer recently spent 10 days traveling 
through guerrillaheld territory in northwestern cambodia where the 
communist khmer rouge are preparing for a major offensive 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
bolstered by their first 
shipments of chinese tanks khmer rouge guerrillas are preparing a 
major attack to seize an area considered cambodias most important 
cultural and historic region 
after making major gains in rural areas in the past year the 
khmer rouge now are shifting to conventional military tactics to 
seize cities and key economic regions western military analysts 
say 
the rebels recently took the key government artillery base at 
sre noi and now say they are preparing to attack bantei srei the 
last major government position defending the provincial capital of 
siem reap and the nearby angkor wat temples the symbol of 
cambodian civilization 
the rebels have massed tanks heavy guns and troops to attack 
government defenses in this northwestern province according to 
field commanders and khmer rouge fighters interviewed in the 
guerrilla zone 
a recent 10day 190mile trek through guerrillaheld area near 
angkor wat showed the rebels had overrun important positions and 
moved freely through villages less than an hours drive from the 
siem reap provincial capital 
we were ordered to attack bantei srei this month and then we 
will attack siem reapsaid bong thieun a young khmer rouge 
soldier interviewed at sre noi 
khmer rouge bulldozers and chainsaws are carving tank and truck 
roads through the jungles toward angkor wat 
what we see happening in siem reap is alarming said a 
western military intelligence analyst they are using a strategy 
different from anywhere else it looks like a real move to take 
siem reap 
analysts said the capture of siem reap and angkor wat would be a 
major psychological victory 
thai and western sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said chinas secret delivery of 24 tanks is the first such shipment 
ever to the guerrillas dozens of the communist rebels have 
returned to the jungles from china where they were trained to 
operate tanks they said 
the sources said 12 tanks are at the khmer rougecontrolled 
district capital of andung veng the staging area for the offensive 
against siem reap the other 12 s near the khmer rougeheld town 
of pailin in western battambang province 
the guerrillas also have received scores of chinese jeeps 
transport trucks and heavy weapons 
the khmer rouge has relied on chinese arms in the nearly 
12yearold war against the vietnameseinstalled government armed 
by the soviet union 
hundreds of thousands of people died from starvation execution 
and disease during the khmer rouges fanatical communist rule from 
1975 until vietnam invaded in late 98 
areas of the countrys north are under the control of former 
monarch prince norodom sihanouk whose guerrillas are allied with 
the khmer rouge and a third rebel group sihanouk has wide support 
among peasants and several thousand of his troops move freely 
through scores of isolated rural villages 
they are welcomed by many villagers fearful of the khmer rouge 
and deeply suspicious of vietnams influence over prime minister 
hun sens government in phnom penh 
but sihanouk commanders say they cannot compete for territory 
with the khmer rouge who have stockpiles of ammunition to fight 
for several years if china were to cut them off 
the khmer rouge have lots of weapons but few supporters 
said sihanouk commander gen kien van at his jungle headquarters 
less than 20 miles from angkor wat 
we have lots of supporters but few weapons so the khmer rouge 
get stronger and the noncommunists get weaker 
the united states and european countries recently decreased 
their support for the noncommunist guerrillas because they feared 
that it would help the khmer rouge return to power 
we are doing our best to provide a democratic alternative to 
the cambodian people but we are weak said prince norodom 
ranariddh sihanouks son and the commander in chief of his army 
the west has decided not to support us so there remains only 
two major forces in cambodia the khmer rouge and hun sen he 
said 
i have to say very frankly and washington will criticize me 
again that against siem reap the khmer rouge will be the major 
attacking forces and the khmer rouge will use tanks and heavy 
artillery 
they have cut the government supply roads and built a 
sophisticated resupply system he said 
gen kien van said the khmer rouge had promised 2000 troops to 
attack siem reap we will have seized angkor wat and siem reap by 
january at the latest he said 
the five permanent members of the un security council 
britain china france the soviet union and the united states 
agreed to a new peace plan for cambodia in late august but talks 
on the plan among the cambodian factions broke down in bangkok last 
month 
after the failure of the bangkok talks khmer rouge leader khieu 
samphan said the next talks should be held on the khmerjsugecontrolled 
khulen mountain north of siem reap city

several hundred kuwaiti refugees 
arrived at this border crossing sunday part of a growing exodus as 
iraq again relaxed its restrictions on kuwaitis leaving the 
occupied emirate 
the border opened friday following intensified night searches in 
kuwait city according to refugees the searches prompted many of 
them to leave out of fear 
iraqi troops were confiscating all identification papers in 
kuwait the refugees reported 
that raised saudi fears that the iraqis were planning to attempt 
to infiltrate agents into the kingdom where a usled 
multinational force has gathered to confront saddam husseins 
troops in kuwait 
the new refugee influx is the largest since midseptember when 
7000 kuwaitis poured through in a threeday frenzy 
iraqs motive in opening the border point was unclear 
but those crossing said they suspected baghdad was allowing 
people to leave for several reasons including its program of 
turning the city into an armed camp isolating the resistance 
movement and resettling iraqis in kuwait 
about 1000 people have arrived since friday most lacking any 
identification border officials said 
up to 700 people most of them women and children were camped 
inside the border crossing awaiting confirmation of their 
identities by saudi officials and the saudibased kuwaiti 
governmentinexile 
saudi arabia has sharply increased security at the khafji 
crossing and reporters are not allowed to circulate there 
there are an estimated 300000 kuwaiti refugees in the saudi 
kingdom and neighboring persian gulf states out of a preinvasion 
native population of 600000 
those arriving said iraqi troops at the border were grabbing 
some men under age 40 and taking bribes to allow others to cross 
sara ismail ibrahim who fled with nine members of her family 
said two men aged 21 and 22 were taken out of their car while 
trying to cross the border and were not seen again 
refugees claim young men are being sent back for iraqi military 
service 
the similar seizure of young men at the border had dried up the 
flow of refugees in september 
one young man who swore at the iraqi soldiers was shot at a 
checkpoint before the border earlier this week said a saudi who 
had been in close contact with arriving refugees he also spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
one group of six young kuwaiti men said sunday that they escaped 
across the desert because they feared they would be seized on the 
road they said iraqi soldiers had fired on their car 
the men were later brought to the border for processing 
the border opening was announced via the iraqicontrolled media 
in occupied kuwait refugees said iraqi troops have been allowing 
only about 30 cars an hour to leave in the morning and midafternoon 
only 
issa elnasrallah a health ministry employee who fled with his 
wife and four children said that many people in kuwait thought 
iraq was preparing for combat there soon 
they also want to isolate the resistance to have everyone but 
them leave theyre trying to force people out he said 
nasrallah said acts of resistance had stopped in kuwait city 
since the iraqis began killing anyone suspected of belonging to the 
resistance many in front of their families 
the refugees said iraqi authorities had announced that everyone 
has to have identification cards issued in baghdad effectively 
changing them all into iraqi citizens 
several hundred westerners are still believed to be hiding in 
kuwait fearful of being taken to iraq for use as human shields at 
military and other strategic installations 
everybodys scared there they dont know when the iraqis will 
come in the house and kill them said yusuf alali 25 a kuwaiti 
airways pilot

east germany would have been 41 years old on 
sunday but few people found a reason to mark the birth of a nation 
that no longer exists 
the oncehallowed anniversary passed quietly with no lavish 
parades no mass protests for democracy and most significantly no 
east germany 
the former communist nation closed out its history wednesday by 
acceding to west germany 
lothar de maiziere the nations first and last freely elected 
leader said sunday was not a day of forced marches and ordered 
jubiliation but simply the first sunday of a united germany 
we have achieved freedom and democracy the former prime 
minister said in a statement we will protect these as precious 
commodities 
the soviet union formed the german democratic republic on oct 
7 1949 from the rubble of the nazi empire and installed a 
stalinist government 
for 40 years the anniversary was a national holiday marked by 
celebrations and parades that paid tribute to the nations history 
and its communist system 
last year however it became a flashpoint for the revolt that 
toppled the old regime and eventually opened the door to 
unification 
the protests that had been gathering steam in the weeks previous 
were given new impetus when soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
visited the country and told east german leader erich honecker to 
institute reforms 
life punishes whoever comes late he told honecker 
thousands protested on the date last year some shouting 
gorby help us less than two weeks later honecker was ousted 
a caretaker communist government opened the berlin wall and 
promised free elections 
de maizieres party was elected on a prounity platform and 
east germanys fate was sealed 
one of the few vestiges of the past was in view sunday as some 
of the activists who helped lead the democratic revolt kept up 
their vigil outside the former headquarters of the communist secret 
police in berlin 
the activists are trying to keep officials from the west from 
gaining control of the secret dossiers on 6 million people they 
say the files should remain on what was once east german land and 
be made available to the public 
officials confirmed saturday that west german investigators have 
begun examining the files to gather evidence to bring former secret 
police leaders to trial 
but there was little else reminiscent of the past the vast 
parking lot in front of the palace of the republic once the seat 
of the former communist parliament was turned over to an 
automobile show that charged passersby 310 to enter 
at the former communistrun old museum the national gallery 
of the gdr remained intact devoted to paintings and sculpture 
rendered by approved artists of the old government 
few people wandered past the stark artwork that paid homage to 
victims of nazi fascism and workers most crowded into the 
remodeled sections devoted to western artists such as picasso 
warhol and lichtenstein 
there were still pockets of pity for the old country however 
i think its tragic that we no longer have autonomy on this 
anniversary said susanne meyl 19 who sells books and 
catalogues of the museums artwork 
ms meyl one of the relatively few remaining members of the 
former communist youth group the free german youth said the 
organization planned a memorial to the end of east germany

when it dropped out last month conway apparently was the first 
pta chapter in the nation to quit the national association because 
of its stance on gun control 
the vote for succession was unanimous about 100 to nothing 
mrs perryman said they will instead form their own parentteacher 
group as yet unnamed she said 
kathy russell a spokeswoman at the ptas national headquarters 
in chicago said chapters rarely quit the 68millionmember 
association which was founded in 1897 
a few drop out because they feel dues are too high but this 
is the first ive heard of anyone pulling out because of the gun 
control issue she said 
what got the 127 members of the conway pta riled was the 
resolution passed by the 100member national pta board of directors 
at the associations annual meeting in june 
noting that one of every 10 childhood deaths in the united 
states in 1987 was caused by a gun the board made up of pta 
members from each state endorsed the brady handgun violence 
prevention act 
the proposed legislation named for james brady the former 
presidential news secretary who was seriously wounded in an 
assassination attempt on president reagan in 1981 would require a 
sevenday waiting period and background check prior to the sale of 
firearms 
the board also called for a ban on militarystyle 
semiautomatic assault weapons 
the pta is not attempting to prevent lawabiding citizens from 
owning guns the resolution said we want to assure that 
firearms arent easily available to minors the mentally ill drug 
addicts illegal aliens or convicted criminals 
ms russell said the resolution one of about a dozen approved 
by the board was not meant to imply that every local pta chapter 
should work to enact guncontrol legislation 
just because its a resolution with the national pta doesnt 
mean we require each of the local units to agree with the 
position she said basically its a consensus of the national 
membership and gives us an official position 
school superintendent larry ament said hes not surprised 
parents in conway a dairyfarming community about 30 miles east of 
springfield got stirred up over the issue 
all but 25 cents of the 150 annual dues paid by each member of 
the conway pta went to the state and national pta many parents 
didnt think they were getting their moneys worth and favored 
putting the money toward local projects ament said 
meanwhile conways pta records dating to 1935 were donated to 
a library 
maybe were making a major mistake in doing this mrs 
perryman said but we had to do something there are better ways 
of educating parents and teachers than standing up for gun 
control

karen wood had just moved to maine with 
her husband and yearold twin girls when she walked behind her 
suburban home on a fall afternoon two years ago 
donald rogerson the manager of a supermarket produce 
department was hunting in the woods behind mrs woods home that 
day nov 15 1988 thinking he saw a deer rogerson fired his 
rifle mrs wood was hit in the chest and died 
a grand jury cleared rogerson but a second grand jury later 
indicted him on a manslaughter charge he goes on trial tuesday in 
penobscot county superior court in bangor 
rogerson has pleaded innocent his lawyer lewis vafiades said 
he will argue the shooting was an accident 
the case triggered a fierce public debate over hunting in a 
state where 216476 people bought hunting licenses last year and 
30260 deer were killed it also revealed tensions between longtime 
residents and newcomers 
the death of mrs wood 37 polarized the public on the issue 
of hunting pitting nonhunters against hunters said william j 
vail commissioner of the state department of inland fisheries and 
wildlife 
the fact that there was no immediate criminal charge in the 
case led some people to say well you can shoot a moose in maine 
illegally and get fined up to 1000 but if you shoot a human 
being nothing happens 
so it became a very emotional issueit went way beyond the 
issue of should we hunt or not 
mrs woods husband kevin complained that the real issue has 
been distorted 
this is not a hunters vs nonhunters issue it is a matter of 
rogerson accepting responsibility for his actions wood said in 
an interview published sunday in the quad city times in davenport 
iowa he now lives in bettendorf iowa 
hunting accidents have not been unusual in maine in 1952 for 
instance 19 people were killed in hunting accidents but the 
number of deaths dropped sharply over the last two decades even as 
the number of hunters swelled 
state officials credit hunter safety programs since 1973 all 
hunters have been required to wear fluorescent orange vests and 
all new hunters applying for licenses have been required since 1986 
to take a hunting safety course 
in 1988 one person was killed in a hunting accident mrs 
wood 
she had moved to maine from iowa four months earlier with her 
infant daughters lindsay and laura and her husband whos a child 
psychologist 
the family lived in the bangor suburb of hermon mrs wood was 
standing behind her home 130 feet from her back door by some 
accounts well within the area where hunting is banned under safety 
laws when she was shot 
rogerson who works at a local shop n save supermarket was 
arrested that evening and charged with manslaughter but the charge 
was dropped the next month after a grand jury concluded his actions 
were neither criminally negligent nor criminally reckless 
the finding triggered a flood of letters to newspapers 
some writers called for more stringent laws to replace the 
current statute prohibiting the use of firearms within 300 feet of 
an occupied residence the legislature rejected the suggestion 
other writers said wood should have worn bright clothing because 
it was deer season some critics even suggested she was at fault 
for wearing white mittens contending they could have been mistaken 
for the underside of a deers tail 
some letters hinted that because she was from away a term 
used to describe people from other states she was ignorant of 
maines hunting practices and traditions 
the state attorney generals office reopened the case after a 
television station reported that a nephew of rogersons lawyer had 
served on the first grand jury the second grand jury indicted 
rogerson in december 
rogerson who is married and has three children faces up to 20 
years in prison if he is convicted 
vafiades would not allow his client to be interviewed but 
vafiades said rogerson feels he is the target because of the 
circumstances of this case 
wood moved from maine shortly after the first grand jury cleared 
rogerson and now lives in iowa with his daughters who are about 
to celebrate their third birthday 
he said he doesnt have high hopes for a conviction part of 
the community has already voiced strong support for the man who 
killed my wife he said 
vafiades said rogerson has not hunted since that november day 
two years ago as part of the settlement of a wrongful death suit 
filed by woods rogerson agreed not to seek a new hunting license 
vafiades said 
he just has no desire for it the lawyer said i doubt if 
hell ever hunt again its still a very emotional thing for him

auction to help the associations 24hour wildlife rescue service

hepburn painted the work while staying at barrymores home 
overlooking beverly hills and the pacific ocean the 16inch by

1960s 
i do hope i will bring a price although i wouldnt give you 
a nickel for it she said in july when she donated the painting 
to the association

books from bob hope shirley maclaine and barbra streisand which 
went for between 20 and 150 each

coast where they hoped for higher bids sosensky said 
 
nashville tenn ap country singer waylon jennings figured a 
joint concert might settle a dispute between a folk group named the 
highwaymen and the group of country stars who use the same name 
he was right 
the country group highwaymen which includes jennings willie 
nelson johnny cash and kris kristofferson asked the folk group 
the highwaymen to open a show for them 
the folk group whose members still perform occasionally and 
sell records as an oldies act had sued the country group for using 
the same name 
jennings thought a joint concert would give the folk group a 
chance to play before a big crowd promote their music and get paid 
for it 
after the folk highwaymen opened for the country highwaymen on 
monday night at the universal amphitheatre in universal city 
calif the folk group dropped its lawsuit said jennings

jurors who acquitted an art gallery and its 
director of obscenity charges say that although they personally 
found some of robert mapplethorpes photographs to be lewd and 
distasteful all agreed they are serious works of art 
the pictures were not pretty no doubt about it juror james 
jones told the cincinnati enquirer in a story published sunday 
but as it was brought up in the trial to be art it doesnt have 
to be pretty 
the jury deliberated two hours friday before clearing dennis 
barrie and the contemporary arts center of misdemeanor pandering 
obscenity and childnudity charges in the first case of its kind 
against an art institution 
three jurors interviewed by the newspaper said they were 
surprised by the swift verdict on both charges the first jury 
vote was 71 in favor of acquittal they did not say who voted to 
convict 
we felt that the prosecution did not prove its case said 
jones a warehouse manager 
five of the pictures in the 175picture exhibition robert 
mapplethorpe the perfect moment depict sexually explicit acts 
involving men two others showed children with their genitals 
exposed 
the jurors told the enquirer they believed the five pictures of 
sex acts to be offensive and designed to appeal to prurient 
interests but they said expert witnesses convinced them the 
photographs had artistic value 
to be considered obscene under supreme court guidelines 
photographs must depict patently offensive sexual conduct and 
offend the average member of the community they also must have no 
literary artistic political scientific or social value 
i think theres something to be learned by these pictures 
said forewoman stacey burton a secretary 
i learned more about that type of lifestyle than i ever 
thought i could possibly know said jennifer loesing a hospital 
supervisor 
six art experts and museum directors testified that the photos 
were important work by a respected artist one prosecution witness 
testified that the pictures had no redeeming value 
ms loesing said hat during deliberations she kept thinking of 
defense lawyer h louis sirkins apple pie analogy that 
without meeting each requirement of the supreme court test the 
photographs were not obscene just as a pie without apples isnt 
an apple pie 
that stuck in a lot of our minds she said 
ms burton said prosecutors failed to prove their case 
i think they could have called in a sociologist or 
psychologist she said somebody who could have said this is 
not art because 
the jurors said they relied on the opinions of the expert 
witnesses 
jurors came from conventional backgrounds none was among the 
81000 people who saw the exhibit three of the eight had been to 
college six lived in the suburbs and all held jobs there were 
four men four women 
sirkin and fellow defense lawyer marc mezibov staked their case 
on testimony by their expert witnesses prosecutor frank h prouty 
said the seven photographs were his case 
much of the art world was willing to testify for the defense 
and sirkin said he and mezibov chose their witnesses carefully 
they ruled out an expert from dayton because of its progressive 
reputation in cincinnati and experts from cleveland and columbus 
because of the hostility some cincinnatians feel toward those 
cities sirkin said 
they also didnt want anyone from new york city because of its 
reputation for licentiousness sirkin said 
rochester was as close as we wanted to get to new york he 
said referring to the testimony of robert a sobieszek senior 
curator of photography at the international museum of photography 
in rochester

scores of radical activists grieving mothers and 
leatherclad youths rallied sidebyside at the gates of the 
defense ministry sunday demanding alternatives to compulsory 
military service 
several hundred people watched and often applauded as speakers 
from the fledgling radical party organizers of the rally 
criticized the united states and the soviet union for the arms 
buildups they said made the drafts necessary 
there is no reason for a universal military draft who is 
threatening us its our own heaping stockpile that is threatening 
us said alexander kalinina a radical party member and deputy on 
the moscow city council 
those who dont want to serve according to their own 
consciences should be allowed to serve in the civil sector 
instead of the military he told the crowd 
the rally on constitution day which marks the adoption of the 
soviet constituion in 1977 was held without official permission 
but there were no confrontations with the dozens of policemen 
posted at each entrance to the whitemarble defense ministry 
building 
every soviet male of 18 or older must serve in the military and 
can be called up during seasonal draft periods one of which is 
occuring this autumn 
soviet officials have admitted that thousands of youths have 
been ignoring draft orders in the last year many refuse to serve 
outside their home republics because among other issues they fear 
the vicious hazing process that often is ethnically motivated 
beatings and harassment of minorities are so rampant that 
several republics refused to allow their youths to be drafted this 
year one report said 15000 soviet soldiers died in the last five 
years in murders suicides and training accidents 
kalinina said many of the 3800 soldiers killed already this 
year had died of injuries from hazings 
the mass media have led a campaign against hazings but it has 
not been very enthusiastic he said 
a halfdozen women representing an increasingly active mothers 
group that seeks more information about their sons who died while 
in service staked out an area at the center of the rally each of 
the women held a photo of a soldier and a handlettered sign 
detailing his birth place of service and date of death 
at one point an elderly woman charged to the front of the 
group pulled an olive green officers hat from a bag and flailed 
it in the air wailing and chanting for her son killed in 
afghanistan the speaker hesitated slightly while the woman sobbed 
and retreated into the crowd 
we dont want to kill we dont want to fight said one sign 
carried by several youths opposed to military service communist 
party army whom do you fight for read another 
we need alternative service like all civilized european 
countries have said igor ptychnikov leader of a raucous group 
called the moscow committee for youth solidarity we want to be 
able to opt out of military service for religious conscience and 
other reasons well serve anywhere but the army 
he said the group many of whose members were clad in leather 
jackets covered with peace slogans and english words has chapters 
and 3000 members in 14 russian cities but he said it has none in 
the surrounding republics because we dont want to be 
occupiers 
in the crowd also were several anarchists waving black flags and 
selling literature others waved the redblueandwhite 
prerevolutionary russian flag and two people held huge light 
blueandyellow flags of the nationalist ukraine

hundreds of foreigners crowded onto 
special flights out of rwandas capital on sunday while government 
forces and rebels clashed in the northern part of the country 
security in large parts of the kigali the capital and at the 
airport was being provided by 500 belgian paratroopers and 300 
french foreign legionnaires sent in to maintain order and protect 
foreigners zaire also has sent 500 soldiers 
some of the more than 700 refugees flown to france and belgium 
recounted the chaos in the country since rebels invaded sept 30 
jeanclaude faydherbe the world banks chief representative in 
rwanda told journalists that he and his family were staying in a 
hotel in kigali when rebels attacked early friday 
it was chaos the french paratroopers were shooting and the 
people coming from uganda also were shooting he said upon 
arrival in paris in the hotel there was panic and the guests 
barricaded the windows with mattresses 
the rwandan soldiers seemed especially nervous and it seemed 
they were firing at the french troops 
a diplomat in kigali reached by telephone from nairobi 
reported no violence in the city early sunday but he added 
weve heard reports of continued fighting in the north including 
some artillery attacks by the government 
he said most of those leaving on the special flights were wives 
and children of aid workers no governments have ordered 
evacuations of their citizens 
a special air france flight carrying 252 foreign evacuees from 
rwanda arrived in paris aboard were about 100 french citizens and 
a large contingent of germans as well as other nationalities 
in brussels 463 refugees arrived aboard three belgian planes 
more than 200 of the refugees were belgian others were dutch 
american german and danish 
up to 1000 foreigners have left kigali on special flights since 
late friday the diplomatic source in rwanda said on condition of 
anonymity 
fridays fighting in kigali lasted only a few hours but there 
were fears the conflict could degenerate into the ethnic violence 
that has plagued rwanda in the past 
the rebels belong mostly to rwandas minority tutsi ethnic 
group they were chased from power three decades ago by the 
majority hutu tribe in clan fighting that killed tens of thousands 
of people 
during those clashes more than 100000 tutsis fled to 
neighboring uganda zaire and tanzania where they have been living 
as refugees ever since 
the diplomat said government soldiers were conducting 
housetohouse searches in some parts of kigali but it was not 
clear whether they were looking for arms or tutsis tutsis are 
generally distinguishable from the shorter stockier hutus by their 
tall lanky physiques 
many of the rebels are said to be deserters from the ugandan 
army their numbers never have been reliably estimated figures 
cited by various diplomatic sources have ranged from a few hundred 
to several thousand 
they are led by maj gen fred rwigyema a rwandan tutsi who 
rose to become the deputy commander of ugandas army he was 
relieved of the post late last year 
the rebels accuse president juvenal habyarimana of abuse of 
power and corruption and say they want to install a democratic 
government they deny that theirs is an ethnic war 
the rebels also say they want to end the refugee problem rwanda 
has been reluctant to readmit its refugees because of a lack of 
space 
pope john paul ii on sunday called for peace in rwanda which he 
visited on an african tour last month 
we pray for an end to the clashes of these recent days and 
that that beloved nation can find peace in justice as soon as 
possible the pontiff said 
the central african nation about the size of maryland is the 
continents most densely populated an average of 566 people occupy 
every rocky and eroded square mile that compares to an average of 
63 people per square mile in the united states

a 10mile string of about 10 new volcanoes 
has been discovered on the ocean floor about 300 miles off the 
oregon coast scientists said 
the volcanoes some more than 100 feet high and a halfmile 
wide were spotted by scientists studying maps and photographs of 
the sea floor along the juan de fuca ridge which runs north and 
south off the washington and oregon coasts 
they were formed within the past decade said robert embley a 
marine geologist with the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations pacific marine environmental laboratory in 
newport 
photographs taken last year and topographic surveys in august 
showed new cones that did not appear in 1981 surveys in august 
scientists using the submersible alvin found fresh lava flows 
extending into and over a large fracture in the sea floor 
the volcanoes are not continuous but they are difficult to 
count because some have joined together embley said in a story 
published sunday in the oregonian they are not huge like mount 
st helens but they can be described more as volcanic mounds 
embley made the discovery with william chadwick a research 
associate with oregon state university and christopher fox a 
remotesensing specialist with noaa the researchers work at the 
hatfield marine science center 
this is a big step embley said its the first time we 
can actually see a seafloor spreading event im sure were going 
to learn a lot about how eruptions occur and what happens during 
these events 
lava comes up from magma chambers beneath such midocean ridges 
where the sea floor forms and spreads 
embley said the volcanoes are about 1 miles deep on the crest 
of the juan de fuca ridge where the juan de fuca and the pacific 
tectonic plates form the juan de fuca plate creeps eastward toward 
the continent from the ridge while the pacific plate moves 
westward the plates are huge slabs of the earths crus 
the volcanoes may be related to gigantic bursts of hot 
mineralrich water called megaplumes embley said the 
megaplumes were discovered by noaa scientists in 1986 and 1987 one 
measured about 12 miles in diameter and 2000 feet thick

former gov scott matheson died of bone 
marrow cancer sunday at the university of utah health sciences 
center a hospital spokesman said he was 61 
the popular twoterm democrat died at 5 am just over a month 
after first receiving treatment for the cancer multiple myeloma 
said hospital spokesman john dwan he had been in and out of the 
hospital several times since sept 4 
matheson served as the states 12th governor from 1977 to 1985 
choosing not to seek reelection despite consistent favorable 
ratings in the polls 
as governor matheson successfully opposed placement of the mx 
missile system in the states western desert battled to continue 
funding of the massive central utah water control project and was 
given high marks for decisive action when parts of the state were 
devastated by flooding in 1983 
the news of scott mathesons death comes as a shock to me 
said republican gov norm bangerter who was speaker of the house 
while matheson was governor 
i am deeply saddened by his passing bangerter said i had 
the privilege of working closely with scott during his eight years 
as governor when i was in house leadership i always found he was a 
man true to his word in my view he had complete integrity 
while we belonged to different political parties scott 
matheson never let politics get in the way of doing what was right 
for the people of utah 
after eight years in office matheson said in late 1988 the 
hours began to wear me down 
i never slept in as governor and for five of my eight years 
in office i never took a vacation he said i immersed myself 
completely in the job but i loved it 
the former counsel for union pacific railroad was a political 
unknown when he was backed for the job by threeterm democratic 
governor calvin l rampton who had decided to return to the 
practice of law 
with ramptons support matheson defeated former republican 
attorney general vernon romney in 1976 and won reelection in 1980 
over former gop state chairman robert wright 
after leaving office he was appointed chairman of the 
democratic national policy council in 1985 and at his death was a 
partner in the salt lake law firm of parsons behle amp latimer 
earlier this year matheson withdrew his name from consideration 
as president bushs nuclear waste negotiator citing personal 
reasons as governor he was an outspoken opponent of locating a 
highlevel nuclear waste repository in his native southern utah 
in 1983 he suffered a mild heart attack spent two weeks in a 
hospital and returned to work 
in may 1987 matheson announced he would not challenge 
republican sen orrin hatch in the 1988 election saying personal 
considerations regarding my family and expanding responsibilities 
as a private attorney figure largely in this decision 
when matheson ruled out a bid for a third term the governors 
chair was won by bangerter ending 20 years of democratic control 
of the office bangerter was reelected in 1988 after matheson 
turned thumbs down on a possible return to the capitol 
dwan said aathesons family would have no comment for at least 
24 hours he is survived by his wife norma three sons and a 
daughter

security forces were on alert in tehran 
sunday the eve of elections for the body that picks irans 
spiritual leader as radicals excluded from running were expected 
to try to block voting sources said 
one asian diplomat described the iranian capital as disturbed 
and tense ahead of mondays popular poll for the 83member 
assembly of experts he declined to elaborate 
the diplomat speaking from tehran said security forces were 
watching for any demonstrations against the controversial 
balloting which radicals charge has been rigged to exclude them 
the radicals want the vote postponed 
the assembly is the constitutional body that chooses and 
monitors irans spiritual leader the current spiritual leader is 
ayatollah ali khamenei 
the hardline opponents of president hashemi rafsanjani leader 
of irans socalled pragmatists accuse khamenei of colluding with 
rafsanjani to fix the elections 
the conflict over the balloting has heightened tension between 
the rival factions and brought the longrunning power struggle in 
tehrans hierarchy more prominently into the public eye 
fistfights erupted in the radicaldominated parliament or 
majlis during a debate on the vote last week sources in tehran 
said on condition of anonymity 
diplomats also speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
radicals attempted to meet last wednesday and saturday at tehran 
university apparently to organize protests but both meetings were 
broken up by security forces 
the antiwestern radicals led by former interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi have been on the defensive since the death of 
their revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in june 
1989 
they fear a purge by rafsanjani who is seeking to rebuild 
bridges with the west after more than a decade of hostility and 
attract investment to revive the sluggish economy devastated from 
the 19801988 persian gulf war with iraq 
radicals suffered a further blow last month when tehran resumed 
relations with britain after a 19month break radical leaders 
believe such ties will dilute khomeinis zealous 1979 revolution 
which overthrew the prowestern shah mohammad reza pahlavi and 
replaced him with the islamic republic 
the official islamic republic news agency reported that grand 
ayatollah mohammed golpayegani one of a handful of supreme 
religious authorities in the country sought to ease tension 
between the factions sunday 
he reminded the feuding groups that only the enemies of islam 
would benefit from disputes and schisms especially among 
officials irna said 
the radicals angered by khameneis support for rafsanjani have 
focused on discrediting him khamenei 51 was overwelmingly 
elected by the assembly of experts to replace the ayatollah 
khomeini 
he can be replaced only if he dies or is declared unfit for the 
position by the assembly the radicals have charged that he does 
not have the religious qualifications to be khomeinis successor 
sources in tehran said the hardliners had wanted to win enough 
seats in mondays election to depose khamenei and replace him with 
a radicalcontrolled leadership council 
to preempt that khamenei ordered his allies on the council of 
guardians a constitutional watchdog body to rule that all 
candidates must pass an examination on islamic jurisprudence before 
they could run 
of 169 wouldbe candidates who sat for the exam 60 flunked and 
most were radicals including parliament speaker mehdi karrubi 
sources said 
some radicals refused to submit to the examination others who 
did pass withdrew their names in protest 
irans 25 million voters have been exhorted for days by the 
statecontrolled radio and television run by rafsanjanis brother 
to vote despite the radical protests 
interior minister abdollah nouri said 100 candidates were 
running in the elections

the chairman of sumitomo bank among the worlds 
three largest banks resigned sunday over a scandal involving 
illegal loans used to manipulate the stock of an aerial survey 
company 
ichiro isoda 77 who led sumitomos growth into japans most 
profitable bank announced his resignation following the arrest 
friday of akinori yamashita a former branch manager 
yamashita was arrested on suspicion of having arranged about 
170 million in illegal loans to two groups allegedly involved in 
stock manipulation 
it is only natural to take responsibility as the top manager 
of the bank in light of the banks public role isoda told a 
news conference 
he said sumitomos president sotoo tatsumi also had expressed 
his intention to resign but isoda persuaded him not to do so 
officials said the bank had not been aware of yamashitas 
actions in japan leaders of organizations often resign to take 
responsibility for the misdeeds of subordinates even if they were 
not personally involved 
news reports said yamashita arranged for bank depositors to 
provide a loan of 85 million at higherthannormal interest rates 
to koshin a speculators group and a separate loan of 86 million 
to another group tosho shoji 
the loan to koshin was used to buy up stocks of kokusai kogyo a 
tokyobased aerial survey company the news report said 
the nationally circulated newspaper asahi shimbun quoted 
investigators as saying yamashita received more than 748000 and 
inside stock information for arranging the loans 
under japans financing law bank employees are prohibited from 
engaging in loan transactions outside their companys normal 
business operations those convicted face a maximum threeyear 
prison term and a 22000 fine 
mitsuhiro kotani head of koshin has been indicted on charges 
of manipulating stocks in violation of the securities and exchange 
law kyodo news service said 
the yomiuri shimbun japans largest newspaper on sunday called 
for a full investigation into the loans and said extensive lending 
for real estate and stock transactions had contributed to spiraling 
land and stock prices 
as a result the prices of both corporate stocks and land were 
inflated far beyond their actual values like a bubble it said 
in an editorial 
most observers believe this years plunge of stock prices 
was the result of the bursting of this bubble 
the tokyo stock exchanges nikkei stock average reached a record 
high of 3891587 last dec 29 but has plunged about 42 percent 
since then some of the recent fall reflects business pessimism as 
a result of the gulf crisis 
japan has only 4 percent of the united states land area but its 
real estate is estimated at nearly four times the total value of 
us real estate about 15 trillion 
sumitomo bank had pretax profits of 27 billion in fiscal 
1989 the largest sum of japans 13 major commercial banks kyodo 
news service said 
the bank reported total assets of 470 billion in march 1990 
putting it slightly behind the worlds largest bank daiichi 
kangyo bank of japan which reported 497 billion in assets 
asset figures were not available for mitsui taiyo kobe bank 
created earlier this year in a merger of two major japanese banks 
and close to sumitomo in size

shut out of other federal tourist attractions 
frustrated visitors from around the world flocked to the capitol on 
sunday to see the legislature in action and give lawmakers a piece 
of their mind 
they should have settled the budget instead of going on 
vacation said 20yearold kara dimugno of southington conn 
referring to the long recess members of congress took in august 
like thousands of other tourists dimugno a senior at the 
university of rhode island came to the capitol because it was the 
best show in washington one of the few sites that has not been 
closed because of the budget stalemate between president bush and 
congress 
unfortunately we are the only game in town so our tour guides 
are really busy said tom keating executive assistant to the 
house sergeant at arms 
although open the action in the capitol was limited at best 
when the house came into session at 4 pm only to recess again 
moments later loud booing erupted from the galleries packed with 
tourists 
the capitol is regularly open on sundays and is always open when 
members are working weekend sessions like the ones scheduled by 
the house and senate on sunday are rare 
on this balmy sunny october day thousands of tourists were 
locked out of some of the nations most historic sights for the 
second day the 13 smithsonian institution museums including the 
air and space museum one of the most popular in the world the 
white house the library of congress and the washington monument 
the shutdown affects nonessential government personnel 
nationwide but federal operations deemed essential such as those 
involving aviation health law enforcement and security are not 
affected by the crisis 
monday is a federal holiday columbus day so federal 
employees are to report to work as usual tuesday when those 
considered nonessential can expect to be sent home within three 
hours 
meantime democratic leaders predicted there would be a budget 
agreement before tuesdays dropdead day 
were going to have a budget package today or tomorrow we 
hope today said house speaker tom foley dwash the house had 
adjourned until midafternoon while the senate did not plan to come 
into session until early evening 
for some tourists it was too late 
were very disappointed said brenda marlatt a nurse from 
ocean nj spending the long weekend here marlatt a single 
mother who has scrimped to bring her daughters ages 10 and 8 to the 
nations capital to see the sights pronounced the budget situation 
a total mess why cant they just pass it 
mike sanders owner of an auto repair shop in concord calif 
planned a more direct approach he wanted to share his views with 
his congressman rep george miller dcalif 
sanders said he was angry that democrats and republicans ganged 
up to kill bushs deficit plan late thursday miller a liberal 
was one of those voting against it 
we really feel reducing the deficit is important said 
sanders wife leeann 
if the united states falls deeper into debt these kids will 
never be able to pay for it sanders added pointing as his sons 
ages 6 and 4 
many members of congress who rejected the budget deal because 
they felt it contained new taxes that might be unpalatable to 
voters in an election year now found themselves confronting 
criticism for not passing it 
but rep john murtha dpa said most of the complaints he had 
heard came from federal workers and cranky tourists not his 
constituents 
even so murtha said we made a mistake in congress by 
rejecting the budget agreement and refusing to follow the lead of 
the democratic leaders and bush murtha voted for the package 
this is not the first time the government has run out of 
spending authority squabbles between the administration and 
congress forced the temporary closing of government three times in 
the last decade

black sea resort of yalta after a clash between residents and 
crimean tatars living in makeshift tent camps pravda reported 
sunday 
stalin forcibly expelled the tatars from the crimea but 
thousands have been filtering back in recent years from siberia and 
central asia the lands to which they were banished during world

the 12 european community nations in 
informal weekend talks opened an ambitious debate on how to grant 
the community a formal role in foreign and defense issues 
the talks among the ec foreign ministers centered on a 17page 
discussion paper drafted by italian foreign minister gianni de 
michelis on how to transfer national authority in defense and 
security matters to the ec 
the talks began saturday and ended sunday 
de michelis said that while the ec nations disagree on key 
points all are committed to finding a convergent approach when 
talks on turning the community into a political union formally 
begin in rome in december 
his discussion paper suggests that the community consider 
bringing the activities of the western european union a 
longdormant defense organization of nine european nato members 
under the ecs wings 
a joint ec security policy could extend to military cooperation 
and disarmament and coordinated participation in military 
initiatives in particular in the context of unmandated 
action the report says 
the paper based on discussions with senior ec political 
officials offers no recommendations on how much sovereignty in 
defense ec nations should retain 
at sundays session the foreign ministers also discussed 
scenarios under which the community could create a formal foreign 
policy role that would be acceptable to all 12 nations officials 
said on condition of anonymity 
only belgium and italy strongly endorsed the notion of letting 
the western european union merge with the ec britain france and 
the netherlands were more cautious 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said he would like to 
see the european pillar of nato strengthened he said sundays 
talks showed not much enthusiasm for the fusion of the western 
european union into the ec 
officials said britain fears that endowing the ec with a role in 
defense matters would weaken the link between western europe and 
its us and canadian allies 
the community said sunday it wants to sign declarations with the 
united states and canada within the next six weeks stressing 
political and economic links across the atlantic 
the ec foreign ministers will continue to discuss political 
union in the weeks ahead they are also considering giving a 
greater say in ec affairs to the european parliament the largely 
advisory 518member assembly that meets once a month in strasbourg 
france 
in december negotiations begin on amending the communitys 1957 
founding treaty to elevate the ec from a trade bloc to an 
organization with a collective foreign policy 
the talks on political union will be held concurrently with 
negotiations on creating an ec central bank and a common ec 
currency 
the 12 members of the european community are belgium denmark 
france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands the united kingdom spain and portugal

a muchpublicized suspect in the 
gainesville student slayings is going to trial on a charge of 
beating his 79yearold grandmother and his lawyers say it wont 
be easy to pick an impartial jury 
edward lewis humphrey has been under intense scrutiny since his 
aug 29 arrest by brevard county authorities soon after that 
investigators named him as a suspect in the slayings of five 
college students 
humphrey has been jailed on 1 million bond and if convicted 
could be sentenced to as much as 5 years in prison however his 
grandmother elna hlavaty says she will testify she was injured in 
a fall and wasnt hit by humphrey 
the trial begins monday with jury selection which officials in 
the brevard county public defenders office warn could be lengthy 
they are worried that news media coverage of the gainesville 
investigation may have damaged humphreys chance for a fair hearing 
on the charge of aggravated assault on the elderly 
i think it will take quite a while said gene stevanus 
executive director of the public defenders office 
news accounts have told of police searching humphreys property 
towing away his car and taking various samples of his body tissue 
along with his history of violent threats nighttime 
reconnaissance missions his fondness for knives and his 
mental illness tied to a car accident 
recently authorities investigating the gainesville slayings 
have appeared to back away from humphrey as a suspect they have 
made little public comment but they have warned gainesville 
residents to be careful because the killer could still be loose 
mrs hlavaty who initially said her grandson hit her now says 
she fell and injured herself the night her grandson came home from 
school 
mrs hlavaty said she is looking forward to the trial as the 
only way for family members to put the nightmare behind them

the head of mobil oil corp has been ordered 
to testify this week in a lawsuit by a former company environmental 
officer who says he was fired for refusing to help cover up 
problems at one of its plants 
mobils chief executive officer allen e murray was ordered by 
a federal judge last week to testify in us district court in a 
civil suit filed against the nations second largest oil company 
the trial resumes wednesday 
plaintiff valcar bowman was fired in 1986 as the no 2 
environmental officer for mobil chemical co he wants his old job 
back along with back pay and legal costs 
mobil denies bowmans claims that his ethical purity got him 
fired the company says bowman was fired as part of a costcutting 
campaign and for insubordination and disobedience 
in a hearing last year us district judge harold ackerman 
noted that bowman lost his job in 1986 mobil chemicals best year 
ever with a record 140 million in profits up 164 percent from 
1985 
bowman doesnt deny being obstreperous at one point saying that 
effective environmental managers are not going to win a 
popularity contest 
the dispute between bowman and the company stems from an 
investigation by los angeles authorities into alleged air pollution 
violations at mobils oil refinery in torrance calif 
on july 18 1985 the los angeles county district attorney 
search warrant in hand swept unannounced into the torrance 
facilityaand emerged with boxes of documents detailing alleged 
violations 
the raid shocked mobil which feared a similar search of the 
mobil chemical co plant in bakersfield calif 
according to company documents mobil ordered bowmans staff to 
deliver all records not required by law to be kept at the plant to 
the companys outside counsel lawrence straw 
the theory was that attorneyclient privilege would keep the 
documents confidential and out of the hands of snooping 
investigators according to charles lindberg mobils chief 
inhouse lawyer 
it would be more difficult for any agency to obtain any of the 
information delivered to mr straw than it would for them to obtain 
that information from mobil directly under subpoena lindberg 
wrote 
bowman says he opposed transferring the documents as unethical 
and immoral and that mobil knew an inspection of the plant was 
imminent 
ackerman in a december hearing described mobils effort to get 
the documents out of the plant and into straws hands as 
frantic 
it is expected that murray will be questioned about the 
transferred documents and his response to a memo bowman sent to the 
ceo about environmental negligence and irresponsibility at the 
firm 
the trial has been going on for five weeks mostly consumed with 
highly technical testimony by bowman

an untreatable fatal genetic disease thought 
confined to the descendants of eastern european jews has turned up 
in this heavily catholic community 
nobody knows how taysachs disease got here but it apparently 
is turning up at an even higher rate than among jews 
babies with taysachs develop normally until they are about 6 or 
7 months old after that they degenerate slowly but steadily 
taking years to die 
its so awful to sit and watch your child deteriorate said 
renee abshire whose daughter maigon died of taysachs less than 
two months after her third birthday 
she lived with constant pneumonia constant coughing mrs 
abshire said the last six months of her life id sit and cry 
mrs abshire 26 was checked twice during her pregnancy for 
deformities or hereditary problems in the developing fetus 
her obstetrician never checked for taysachs it didnt seem 
necessary testing for taysachs is routine in many jewish 
communities but renee and david abshire are fundamentalist 
christians and unaware of any jewish ancestors 
talking with doctors around southwest louisiana mrs abshire 
now president of the local taysachs amp allied diseases association 
chapter found three other children with taysachs 
none was jewish and in three of the four cases including hers 
at least one parent had attended iota high school 
the connection made this cajun town of 1200 people something of 
a genetic ground zero three cases werent an epidemic but were 
enough to make people wonder how a rogue gene a destroyer of 
children had slipped into their bloodlines 
in this small a community youd never see this many cases so 
you can say its kind of an explosion said dr michael quinn a 
crowley pediatrician who treats children from iota it has to be 
that someone moved there years and years ago and two families had 
the gene and through intermarriage right in the iota area thats 
where the disease is concentrated 
dr emmanuel shapira a tulane medical center geneticist 
checked the blood from 230 townspeople in july more people wanted 
to be tested but shapira ran out of test kits the results he 
said were astonishing 
its very very high at a level to justify screening every 
couple that wants to have children he said as many as 5 
percent are going to be born with it 
he said 17 of the people he screened carried the gene that can 
cause taysachs thats 74 percent or nearly double the carrier 
rate among jews and about 20 times the rate among the entire 
population 
a child with taysachs lacks a crucial enzyme the body needs to 
break down fatty deposits in brain and nerve cells 
without the enzyme deposits accumulate disastrously the 
nervous system stops working muscle tone vanishes respiratory 
problems develop it is always fatal usually before the age of 5 
the disease is on a gene carried by about 4 percent of all jews 
and about a tenth that rate in the entire population there is no 
reliable estimate of the number of cases said marjorie epstein a 
spokeswoman for the national taysachs amp allied diseases 
association 
carrier couples who try to have children face another tough 
decision what to do if a prenatal test shows the fetus has 
taysachs abortion is frowned upon in this conservative 
overwhelmingly catholic section of louisiana 
the abshires have decided not to try to conceive again 
the hardest decision for me if i got pregnant again would be 
to terminate my pregnancy said mrs abshire i know of someone 
who had to do that god didnt set me down here to judge her who 
am i to judge her when i know what taysachs did to me and my 
husband what we went through

a series of underwater volcanoes has begun 
rising from the sea floor off the coast of oregon researchers said 
sunday 
the volcanoes have appeared during the past 10 years forming a 
line about 300 miles off the coast according to dr robert embley 
of the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations pacific 
marine environmental laboratory 
several of the volcanoes are more than 100 feet high and a 
halfmile wide according to embly and researchers from oregon 
state university 
embley said the appearance of the underwater volcanoes may be 
related to gigantic bursts of hot mineralrich water discovered in 
the same area in 1986 and 1987 during research on the sea floor 
this is the first time scientists have been able to determine 
the date of particular ocean floor volcanoes according to embley 
monitoring the development may allow them to learn more about how 
such events affect ocean chemistry and temperature 
the cones were discovered when sea floor pictures and surveys 
made during the last year were compared with 1981 surveys and 
several new volcanoes were found researchers then dove into the 
area in the submersible alvin and found that fresh lava flows 
extend into and cover a large fracture that had cracked the older 
sea floor 
the researchers believe that the sea floor in the area is 
actively spreading producing increased volcanic activity 
this region is part of the socalled ring of fire a system of 
volcanic and earthquakeprone regions than encircle the pacific 
ocean caused by movement of the giant plates that make up the 
surface of the earth it is here that the pacific plate is grinding 
against the north american plate the same activity that helps 
provoke earthquakes in california and alaska and volcanic eruptions 
such as that of mount st helens 
while the development of volcanoes under the ocean is not 
thought to be unusual scientists do not really know how often such 
eruptions occur because of limited ability to monitor their 
development

a woman threw herself over her 2yearold 
granddaughter just as a 1ton wheat planter rolled over them and 
each somehow survived the twisting blades 
she just lay down on her said the childs mother karrie 
sullivan i dont think my daughter would be here today if she 
had not done that 
joansullivan 54 of niles was hospitalized for treatment of 
broken bones and bruises young sara escaped fridays accident with 
just a few scrapes 
she saved her life basically karrie sullivan said and 
joan could have been a lot worse i just cant believe it 
the accident occurred while saras grandfather james sullivan 
was planting wheat on the 800acre family farm in niles about 20 
miles east of salina 
sara dashed between the tractor and the planting bins it was 
dragging and her grandmother went after her her grandfather didnt 
see or hear either of them as he drove the tractor 
the wheat drills discs just ran over the top of her and 
chopped her up pretty bad said joans cousin peter sullivan 
it kind of buried them in the ground a little bit you know 
a wheat planter called a drill hooks behind a tractor and 
plants seed in grooves cut by sharpedged discs about a foot in 
diameter the discs are about eight inches apart and are followed 
by rollers that compact the seed into the soil 
no one could say why joan and sara sullivan were not injured 
more seriously peter sullivan speculated that because the field 
was tilled for sowing the softer earth cushioned the victims 
he also said the discs have a spring system that allows them to 
give slightly when they hit a large object

the populist freedom party capitalizing 
on widespread popular discontent over bureaucracy and corruption 
made strong gains in parliamentary elections sunday 
the governing socialists slightly increased their representation 
and offered to form a new coalition government with the 
conservative peoples party which lost ground in the balloting 
the socialists made it clear throughout the election campaign 
they would not form a coalition with the freedom party which they 
say is too far right 
preliminary results announced by interior minister franz 
loeschnak showed the freedom party increased its representation 
from 18 to 33 seats in the 183seat parliament and won 17 percent 
of the vote up from 10 percent in 1986 
the socialist party added one seat and now holds 81 
the big loser was the peoples party which has been in a 
coalition with the socialists since 1986 it lost 17 of its 77 
seats its worst defeat in history 
the fourth major party the green alternative won nine seats 
an increase of one 
freedom party leader joerg haider appealed to nationalist 
sentiments and voters seeking a change after 45 uninterrupted years 
of rule by either the socialists or the peoples party 
he hammered away at the special advantages members of the two 
big parties enjoy and attacked the relatively liberal treatment 
given immigrants from neighboring east european countries 
the charismatic 40yearold had said he hoped his party could 
win between 2530 seats with its campaign against bureaucracy and 
highlevel mismanagement 
at least three corruption cases are pending against prominent 
socialists 
the 30 seats in parliament were our admittedly ambitious 
target said heide schmidt general secretary of the freedom 
party the fact that we may achieve this or gain even more fills 
me with gratification 
helmut kukacka the peoples party general secretary called it 
a heavy depressing defeat 
we are certainly the big losers he said 
the conservatives still bear the burden of their support four 
years ago for president kurt waldheim who is accused of concealing 
his world war ii past waldheim was not considered a major issue in 
this campaign however 
the socialists said their showing was a vote for chancellor 
franz vranitsky by far the most popular politician in austria 
party chief secretary josef cap said the result would underscore 
the socialists claim to leadership 
vranitzky said he would invite the peoples party for coalition 
talks 
but he added it must be clear that the formation of a 
government cannot retroactively correct the election results 
indicating a reduced role for the conservatives 
only 83 percent of the 56 million austrians registered to vote 
went to the polls one of the lowest turnouts in national 
elections in 1986 90 percent of the voters participated 
there were few clearcut issues in what was generally regarded 
as among the most uninspring election campaigns in years 
the main topics were austrian efforts to win membership in the 
european community calls by the right to limit immigration and 
foreign labor and mutual pledges to reduce privileges of officials 
who hold two or more paid jobs 
many observers said that with the likelihood the coalition would 
continue after the election leaders of the major parties refrained 
from sharply attacking each other 
vranitzky 53 has been working with his party to recover from 
stinging publicity caused by several party officials who tampered 
with public funds in the scandal socialist chancellor fred 
sinowatz was recently found guilty of perjury

echo and misha two dolphins held captive 
for more than two years as part of a california research project 
splashed to freedom in the same shallow waters they once knew as 
their home 
when they start swimming along the coast and socializing with 
other dolphins then well call it a success said conservation 
biologist randy wells who plans to track the dolphins for a year 
in what scientists say is the first extensive study of how captive 
dolphins adapt in the wild 
of course it will take them a while to get their bearings 
wells said 
within seconds after a dozen mote marine laboratory researchers 
gingerly lowered echo and misha into the water saturday they sped 
off in tandem and beached themselves on a sandbar 
cheers turned to concern and researchers swam out to the 
foundering dolphins and gave them a second push within an hour 
they were spotted swimming with a pod of about three dolphins 
wells affiliated with the chicago zoological society took the 
dolphins from the same harbor in the summer of 1988 for a project 
at the university of california at santa cruz he wanted to study 
the sophisticated system of sounds dolphins use to gather 
information about their watery environment 
last month the two 300pound dolphins were transported to mote 
on central floridas gulf coast to prepare for their return home 
while other captive dolphins have been released in the wild 
wells said this is the first project involving electronic 
monitoring and tracking to find out how captive dolphins readjust 
and socialize 
you have to understand that for the past two years these 
dolphins have been isolated and handfed nothing but frozen fish 
said kerri dieffenwierth spokeswoman for mote where the dolphins 
were held in a protective lagoon taught to eat live fish and 
slowly weaned from human contact 
for the first two days in the wild the 8 and 9yearold males 
will be followed around the clock both visually and with the help 
of a coinsized radio transmitter on echos dorsal fin 
male dolphins tend to bond for life the spokeswoman said 
they were together when we found them and they should be together 
forever 
the transmitter has a range of more than six miles and an 
expected life of two weeks before the specially designed bolts 
dissolve and fall off 
after that and for the year to come researchers working from a 
small boat will track the dolphins three to four days a week and 
for up to 12 hours a day taking photographs to see how well they 
are assimilating into dolphin society and even counting their 
breaths to gauge their health 
if they begin to show signs of sickness or are shunned by other 
dolphins scientists are prepared to take them back but wells 
doesnt expect that to happen

mormon church leaders on sunday decried 
abortion homosexuality and drug addiction as morally and 
spiritually dangerous lifestyles 
in or out of marriage abortion is not an individual choice 
at a minimum the lives of three are involved elder boyd k 
packer told the churchs 160th semiannual general conference 
only in cases of incest rape when a mothers health is 
jeopardized or a severely deformed fetus who cannot survive birth 
is abortion anything but a thou shalt not packer said and 
even then much sober prayer is required to make the right 
choice 
the twoday conference of the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints concluded sunday with the faiths president ezra 
taft benson still hospitalized in serious condition following 
surgery nearly three weeks ago for blood clots on the brain 
church officials said benson 91 watched the proceedings on 
television 
packer a senior member of the council of the twelve apostles 
blasted those who justify homosexuality by saying these impulses 
are inborn cannot be overcome and should not be resisted 
they quote scriptures to justify perverted acts between 
consenting adults that same logic would justify incest or the 
molesting of little children of either gender he said 
i believe that most people are drawn to a life of drug 
addiction or perversion or submit to an abortion without really 
realizing how morally and spiritually dangerous they are 
elder joseph b wirthlin of the twelve warned against getting 
sidetracked by activities that begin innocently or that are 
perfectly legitimate in moderation but in excess they can cause us 
to veer from the straight and narrow path to our destruction 
among those he said are excessive viewing of sports 
television improper movies and devotion to obtaining material 
possessions such as homes that are larger than necessary 
and even if we are blessed enough to afford such luxury we 
may be misdirecting resources that could be used better to build 
the kingdom of god or to feed and clothe our needy brothers and 
sisters wirthlin said 
gordon b hinckley bensons first counselor in the governing 
first presidency lamented that the 75 millionmember church 
likely would never shed its nickname the mormon church in favor 
of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
because of the shortness of the word mormon and the ease with 
which it is spoken and written they will continue to call us the 
mormons the mormon church and so forth hinckley said they 
could do worse

state rep david duke conceded defeat sunday 
to incumbent us sen j bennett johnston who said he got the 
message from 600000 voters who backed duke a former klan leader 
running as a republican 
duke backed off his threat to file a lawsuit over absentee 
ballots cast but not counted for state sen ben bagert the 
official republican nominee bagert dropped out two days before 
saturdays primary amid pressure from national gop leaders who 
feared his presence in the race would help duke force a november 
runoff 
well help people who feel their right to vote has been 
abrogated duke said well help them pursue that if they so 
desire but im trying to do as bennett johnston said and kind of 
heal at this point 
complete but unofficial returns gave johnston 749552 votes or 
54 percent and duke 605681 votes or 44 percent two minor 
democratic candidates split the remainder nick accardo had 21709 
votes and larry crowe had 14472 votes 
dukes strength surprised pollsters as he carried 23 of the 
states 64 parishes and held johnston close in several others duke 
had campaigned on a ticket that opposed affirmative action and 
proposed welfare reform and a flatrate federal income tax 
johnston said duke benefited from a protest vote arising from 
sour economic conditions in louisiana 
a lot of those votes were protest votes johnston said 
people were sort of venting their spleen they said well im 
going to send old bennett a message bennett got the message 
he said he would work to diversify the states economy away from 
the petroleum industrys boomandbust cycles 
under louisianas unusual open primary system all candidates 
run against each other in the primary regardless of party a 
runoff would have been held nov 6 if johnston had failed to 
receive a majority saturday 
bagert withdrew too late to get his name off the ballot under a 
1981 law bagerts votes could not be counted 
some were however because it was too late to change computer 
programs or courthouse operations those reported to the associated 
press gave bagert 10536 votes less than 1 percent of the 14 
million cast 
duke said political deals were responsible for bagerts 
withdrawal johnston drew the unprecedented crossparty endorsement 
of eight senate republicans and jack kemp secretary of housing and 
urban development 
johnston said his 10 percent victory margin would have been 
considered a landslide had it not been for dukes presence in the 
race 
when you can win at a time that incumbents all over the 
country are in trouble when louisiana has been in a depression and 
when people are trying to send a message i think thats a 
tremendous win johnston said 
duke said he was studying a possible run for governor in 1991 
such a race would require him to give up his state house seat 
which he won in a special election in 1989 
there also has been speculation duke might seek a us house 
seat in 1992 probably from one of the north louisiana districts 
that gave him strong support saturday 
johnston said dukes political future was limited and predicted 
he would never win a statewide race or capture a us house seat 
ed renwick a political pollster for loyola university said it 
would be difficult to discount duke in future races because he drew 
55 to 60 percent of the white vote 
he said dukes support on saturday was threefold voters 
opposed to johnston voters who merely wished to send a message 
and fullfledged duke supporters 
i think hell keep the third group renwick said hell 
lose the first group the question is how long hell keep the 
second group 
in other races on saturdays ballot new orleans was assured of 
having its first black congressman since reconstruction when state 
sen william jefferson and marc morial both democrats led a field 
of 12 to replace retiring rep lindy boggs jefferson and morial 
meet in the runoff next month 
by a 21 ratio voters also approved louisianas first lottery 
since a corrupt private lottery was shut down by congress in the 
late 1890s under a bill already approved by the legislature the 
games will be managed by a quasigovernmental corporation 
new orleans district attorney harry connick acquitted earlier 
this year of federal charges stemming from the return of a

president bush spent much of the holiday 
weekend in his mountaintop retreat at camp david md 75 miles 
from the budget battle that left tourists locked out of the 
capitals most famous monuments 
left behind in the white house was a skeleton staff of ushers 
butlers and maids but a full complement of secret service and 
uniformed officers 
in a concession to austerity bush eschewed his marine one 
helicopter and made the trip up to the catoctin mountains by 
motorcade saturday night 
its a lot less expensive to go by motorcade said john 
herrick a white house press aide who accompanied the president 
before leaving for camp david bush had vetoed a shortterm 
spending measure that congress passed friday night without 
spending authority a phased shutdown of nonessential government 
services began nationwide 
with the house trying to work out another budget pact sunday 
bush conferred by telephone from camp david with white house chief 
of staff john sununu and treasury secretary nicholas brady the two 
men were part of the troika of key administration aides who 
negotiated the deal soundly rejected by the house early friday 
sununu appearing on cnns newsmaker sunday program said 
the administration remained reluctant to raise income tax rates and 
still would prefer a package like the one that went down to defeat 
in the house 
but sununu said the aim now was to find a way to allow the 
congressional committees to get some of the rough edges off a 
deal 
roman popadiuk a deputy white house press secretary working 
from home said the next step is up to the hill theyre supposed 
to come up with a budget 
bush was at camp david with thomas lud ashley a former ohio 
congressman and yale classmate who is now a banking industry 
executive 
barbara bush planned to join her husband at camp david later 
sunday after flying down from the couples oceanfront home at 
kennebunkport maine 
bush himself had planned to spend the extended columbus day 
holiday weekend in maine but canceled that trip in light of the 
budgetary crisis 
he attended a 9 am private service at a navy chapel at camp 
david as he usually does during his frequent stays there 
camp david is located within a 10000acre preserve known as the 
catoctin mountain park and the adjacent cunningham falls state 
park 
like other national parks catoctin mountain park was among the 
first to feel the budget pinch with its visitor center closed and 
nature hikes and other interpretive programs canceled 
camp david itself however is a navy installation staffed 
permanently by navy personnel and marine guards and its 
recreational facilities were not subject to the shutdown 
bush tentatively planned to return to the white house by 
motorcade monday again passing up the speedier but costlier 
helicopter ride herrick said 
the white house normally is closed to public tours on sunday 
officials said earlier that 65 of the 383 people who usually work 
there were deemed essential including the national security 
council staff that operates the situation room 24 hours a day 
but the staff that operates the executive mansions living 
quarters butlers maids chefs and others was cut from 70 to 
10

pakistans armybacked caretaker 
government said sunday it had arrested 58 agents who slipped into 
sind home province of ousted prime minister benazir bhutto to 
sabotage oct 24 parliamentary elections 
a government spokesman said several of the agents confessed to 
having been sent by the indian government and others claimed 
membership in the militant alzulfikar organization named for ms 
bhuttos father zulfikar ali bhutto 
zulfikar ali bhutto was overthrown in a 1977 coup and was hanged 
two years later for his alleged complicity in a murder plot 
army chiefofstaff gen mirza aslam beg warned last week that 
india was hatching a plot to wreck pakistans elections 
india and pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 
1947 tensions have risen recently over a moslem separatist 
movement in indiacontrolled kashmir 
if they can undermine the elections pakistan can be 
destabilized said a government official speaking of india 
the official and the government spokesman spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
alzulfikar was run by ms bhuttos younger brother murtaza 
who has been living in syria since he orchestrated the 1982 
hijacking of a pakistan international airline aircraft 
pakistans newspapers carried many stories over the past week 
about election sabotage plots fuelling fears that polls could be 
postponed 
several analysts said an upsurge in ms bhuttos popularity 
since her dismissal by president ghulam ishaq khan on aug 6 may be 
worrying those who fired her 
an indian embassy spokesman in islamabad said he knew nothing of 
indian nationals being arrested 
normally if there were indians arrested the foreign office 
would be obliged to call us he said speaking on condition of 
not being further identified 
the president dismissed ms bhuttos 20monthold government on 
charges of unchecked corruption and abuse of power 
the dismissal probably was approved by the nations powerful 
military which has ruled pakistan for 25 years of its 43 years as 
a nation there is little love lost between the bhutto family and 
the pakistani military 
even ms bhuttos critics concede that her popularity has soared 
since ishaq khan announced that special onejudge tribunals would 
investigate her goverment for corruption 
the tribunals have been assailed as overtly partisan they have 
indicted ms bhutto her husband asif ali zardari and about six 
former cabinet ministers 
if convicted ms bhutto could be barred from politics for up to 
seven years she could be tried separately on criminal charges

hundreds of kuwaitis crossed into saudi arabia on sunday after 
iraq suddenly relaxed restrictions on kuwaitis leaving the occupied 
emirate some refugees said it was the latest move in an iraqi 
campaign to depopulate kuwait isolate the resistance movement and 
prepare for war 
world leaders kept up diplomatic efforts to achieve a peaceful 
solution to the crisis that arose with iraqs invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 
japans prime minister toshiki kaifu traveled to oman after a 
twoday visit with king faud in saudi arabia 
plo leader yasser arafat met king hussein in jordan and said a 
peace initiative on the gulf crisis was being formulated according 
to the plan proposed by iraqi president saddam hussein 
on aug 12 saddam said he would discuss withdrawing from kuwait 
if the israelis also withdrew from the west bank and gaza strip 
arafat said saddams proposal has brought aboutan 
international consensus for the need to solve the palestinian 
problem 
the linkage is becoming possible now those who believe 
otherwise let them submit their own proposals to solve the middle 
east problems he said 
egyptian foreign minister ismat abdulmaguid meanwhile arrived 
in damascus for talks with syrian president hafez assad he 
indicated he was making the visit to increase cooperation in 
forcing iraq out of kuwait 
kaifu arrived in the mideast last week to offer financial help 
to frontline states turkey jordan and egypt and to seek a 
political solution he has referred to a new world order after the 
crisis is solved in which japan was eager to play a role 
kaifu spokesman shigeo takaneka said fahd urged tokyo to spread 
its financial aid to other nations hit by the unimposed economic 
blockade of iraq such as syria and bangladesh 
takaneka said japan reiterated its call for iraqs complete and 
unconditional withdrawal from kuwait restoration of the emirates 
leadership and release of all foreigners detained by iraq after its 
attack on kuwait 
kuwaiti refugees at the khafji border crossing in saudi arabia 
said the border opened on friday following intensified night 
searches in kuwait city which prompted many of them to leave out of 
fear they said iraqi troops were confiscating all identification 
papers in kuwait 
that raised saudi fears that the iraqis planned to try to 
infiltrate agents into the kingdom 
about 1000 people arrived from kuwait over the weekend most 
lacking any identification saudi border officials said the influx 
was the largest since midseptember when 7000 kuwaitis poured 
through in a threeday frenzy 
us military officials in washington and saudi arabia meanwhile 
reported the american troop buildup in the crisis area was nearly 
complete with almost 200000 us soldiers deployed there us 
troops lead a multinational force arrayed in the saudi desert to 
forestall any further iraqi military thrust 
iraq controls 20 percent of world oil reserves with its takeover 
of kuwait saudi arabia which adjoins kuwait is the worlds 
biggest oil exporter 
in other developments 
soldiers in israel began handing out gas masks to civilians in 
a nationwide drive to guard israelis from a possible iraqi chemical 
arms attack military officials called it just a preventive 
measure prime minister yitzhak shamir said in a speech israel 
has no intentions to attack iraq although it takes baghdads 
chemical attack threats seriously israel radio said 
the british newspaper independent identified a chinese company 
it said supplied iraq with a rare chemical used to make nuclear 
weapons missile fuel and nerve gas it said the china wanbao 
engineering co contracted to supply seven tons of lithium hydride 
to iraq breaching the un embargo beijing officials last week 
strongly denied an earlier report about a chemical deal 
about 100000 italians joined a 15mile peace march from 
perugia to assisi in northern italy many demanding that force not 
be used in the crisis 
britains visiting armed forces minister archibald hamilton 
said in bahrain that britain is redeploying a squadron of tornado 
gr1 groundattack jets from bahrain to saudi arabia and 12 jaguar 
strike aircraft from oman to bahrain this is basically to 
enhance our deterrent effect he said 
kuwait airways has started chartering flights from cairo to 
take home thousands of sri lankan refugees transported from camps 
in jordan an airline officer said in the egyptian capital the 
airline national carrier of kuwait has been out of operation 
since the invasion a flight saturday which carried about 376 sri 
lankans home was its first in more than two months 
the european community nations discussed a military solution to 
the crisis but concluded it was better to see if the world trade 
embargo forces iraq to leave kuwait time is not in favor of 
saddam hussein italian foreign minister gianni de michelis told 
reporters at the meeting in venice italy 
the dutch government said its ambassador in kuwait was expected 
to leave for baghdad effectively closing the mission because of 
unbearable conditions caused by iraqi pressure foreign ministry

discoverys astronauts their 
primary job behind them started a small fire aboard the shuttle 
sunday as part of an experiment to study the spread of flames in 
space 
the solar probe ulysses meanwhile sped safely toward jupiter 
at a recordsetting 34130 mph discoverys fiveman crew started 
the satellite on its roundabout journey of 186 billion miles 
shortly after liftoff saturday 
the first test fire aboard a shuttle burned about 70 seconds 
within a sealed aluminum container as cameras recorded the event 
shuttle safety managers wanted to observe how fire acts in the 
absence of earths gravity 
the cylinder was filled with equal amounts of oxygen and 
nitrogen the amount of gases will vary when the experiment is 
repeated on future flights 
discoverys fivemember crew arose shortly before 3 am edt for 
its first full day in space sunday the astronauts are scheduled to 
stay in orbit until a wednesday morning landing at edwards air 
force base calif 
saturdays launch marked the end of months of frustration for 
the national aeronautics and space administration which has 
suffered through problems with its shuttle fleet and the flawed 
hubble space telescope columbia and atlantis have been grounded 
since early summer by hydrogen leaks 
discoverys smooth liftoff nasas first shuttle launch in 
nearly six months was followed by successful deployment of the sun 
probe ulysses 
the 250 million european spacecraft is expected to arrive at 
jupiter in february 1992 the powerful gravity pull of that giant 
planet will act like a slingshot accelerating the probe to an even 
higher speed and sending it streaking back toward the sun 
kathy thornton of mission control in houston told crew members 
before they went to sleep sunday that ulysses was slightly cooler 
than expected but within its temperature limits 
ulysses is to pass over the suns south pole in 1994 and the 
north pole in 1995 it will be the first spacecraft to orbit over 
the solar poles 
preliminary data show ulysses will spend 231 days above 71 
degrees solar latitude seven or eight days more than if discovery 
had gone up friday the earliest possible launch date for the 
mission thornton said nasa had to delay the launch for a day 
this is another space first a customer whos happy with a 
launch delay thornton told the pleased crew 
sundays fire experiment was designed from the beginning 
knowing what we were doing and its design was carefully reviewed 
by safety experts said louis ignaczak the projects supervisor 
coincidentally discovery commander richard n richards had a 
fire scare during his first space flight in august 1989 a short 
circuit sent smoke and sparks into the cabin of the shuttle 
columbia nasa said the crew was never in danger 
we can never learn enough about fire safety as far as im 
concerned aboard the orbiter richards said before discoverys 
flight 
as part of another experiment sunday the astronauts extended 
discoverys 50footlong robot arm attached to the boom are two 
patches of material identical to that used on solar panels of a 
communications satellite stranded in a uselessly low orbit 
intelsat an organization of countries that owns the satellite 
wants to measure how much the same kind of material on the 
satellite will decay in space before nasa sends up astronauts in 
early 1992 to repair the craft 
provided the results from this experiment are not wildly 
different from what we expect it will be the final piece of data 
that gives us the confidence to go ahead and rescue the 
spacecraft said intelsat scientist andrew dunnet 
the 157 million satellite failed to separate properly from an 
unmanned titan rocket in march intelsat is suing rocket maker 
martin marietta corp for at least 400 million in damages 
earlier sunday astronauts bill shepherd and bruce melnick 
reported only limited success with an experiment to control tv 
cameras with voice commands their voices were recorded prior to 
the mission onto computer chips that the system was supposed to 
recognize in space 
the system is designed to free astronauts of manual camera 
operations and thus let them to do more than one thing at a time 
shepherd and melnick tried moving the cameras by speaking such 
words as up down and zoom out melnick had better luck 
than shepherd who reprogrammed the system with the sound of his 
voice in space but still achieved little success 
the two planned to repeat the experiment monday and again 
tuesday

the united auto workers union and ford 
motor co reached a tentative national labor contract sunday 
closely mirroring the agreement last month with general motors 
corp 
this tentative agreement provides that uawrepresented ford 
workers will fully share in the gains achieved by the pattern 
settlement reached earlier at general motors said uaw president 
owen bieber in a statement 
under the threeyear deal ford will put aside about 15 
billion to cover the income of workers who are laid off bieber 
said gm which has three times as many uaw workers promised to 
spend up to 4 billion to protect the incomes of laidoff workers 
negotiators stayed up all saturday night to close the deal as 
the negotiations intensified last week after the unions contract 
with gm was ratified the main dispute was a clause calling for 
penalty pay up to 5 an hour for excessive scheduled overtime 
that provision in the gmuaw contract was aimed directly at 
ford since the late 1980s fords manufacturing employees worked 
considerably more overtime than those at gm at one time nearly 20 
percent of the cars and trucks the automaker assembled were made by 
workers on overtime 
ford chairman harold poling said he did not expect the overtime 
penalty to be an immediate problem because of the falloff in truck 
and car sales 
i think short term were going to be faced a serious problem 
because of the general economy poling said i think its going 
to take some time to evaluate what the alternatives are 
analysts and automakers have forecast a slow recovery in the 
sales rate of cars and trucks in the united states from a trough 
late last year 
ford probably wont have much in overtime expenditures next 
year auto analyst david healy of the new york investment banker 
barclays de zoete wedd said sunday 
the union has scheduled a meeting of its 135member ford 
bargaining council for tuesday in dearborn that panel of union 
local presidents and bargaining committee officials must approve 
the tentative agreement before it is sent to the uaws 44 ford 
locals for rankandfile ratification 
about 100000 ford employees are covered by the uaw national 
contract gm has about 300000 workers represented by the union 
and chrysler corp which still must bargain a national agreement 
has about 63000 hourly and salaried uaw members 
provisions of the pattern agreement included 
a threeyear income guarantee for every worker laid off for 
more than 36 weeks at factories closed because of slow car truck 
or parts sales 
a 3 percent boost in workers base wages in the first year and 
lumpsum payments of 3 percent of wages in the second and third 
years 
continuation of costofliving adjustments in wages 
improvements in pension payments 
no change in healthcare provisions 
the gmuaw agreement was ratified a week ago in a lopsided 80 
percent to 20 percent vote after a contract with ford is ratified 
the uaw will head to chrysler 
there the union and the company are at loggerheads over whether 
the financially struggling company will be allowed to deviate 
greatly from the pattern agreement 
company officials have insisted that chrysler needs relief from 
soaring healthcare costs and the pattern agreement first 
negotiated with gm provides no changes

unusually upbeat after an unsettling us 
senate race j bennett johnston said sunday that david dukes 
strong challenge would not shove him to the political right 
johnston said his 10point victory over duke would have been 
considered a landslide if his opponent had not been a former ku 
klux klan grand dragon 
when you can win at a time that incumbents all over the 
country are in trouble when louisiana has been in a depression and 
when people are trying to send a message i think thats a 
tremendous win johnston said 
theres frustration out there he said when people are 
unemployed and underemployed its easy to blame it on someone 
else its easy to blame it on affirmative action 
johnston a democrat captured a fourth term in saturdays 
primary unofficial returns gave him 54 percent of the vote against 
44 percent for duke who was running as a republican on a platform 
that opposed affirmative action 
during his third term johnston was linked with the liberal wing 
of the senate with an unsuccessful bid to become senate majority 
leader and his key role in opposing supreme court nominee robert 
bork at the same time he usually voted along conservative lines 
on such issues as defense 
the left is not comfortable with him the right is not 
comfortable with him said wayne parent a political scientist at 
louisiana state university 
johnston said he got the message from voters who backed 
duke asked whether the scare would move him more into the 
conservative ranks he said no its going to push me closer to 
the people working harder for the people that means doing even 
more than ive done 
johnston chairman of the senate energy committee which 
oversees legislation dealing with the oil and gas industry has 
drawn fire for accepting millions of dollars in campaign donations 
from political action committees including the petroleum and 
petrochemical industries both industries have been blamed for 
contributing heavily to louisianas environmental problems 
until this race johnston had no problems winning reelection 
parent said dukes showing probably would not affect johnstons 
place in washington hell be viewed as a senator who survived an 
odd race as many senators have he said 
johnston pledged to work against duke in any future race duke 
said sunday that he is considering a run for governor next year 
david duke may have the gestapo but weve got the shock 
troops in our favor johnston said

president vaclav havel said sunday 
an energy crisis stemming from a drop in soviet oil supplies could 
undermine czechoslovakias new democracy 
authorities began cutting back on gasoline sales saturday 
because moscow has not been meeting its quota of oil deliveries 
citizens can buy about seven gallons of gas a month at the official 
price of about 3 purchases exceeding that cost more 
havel is seeking an urgent meeting with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev and prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov to discuss the 
oil crisis 
i would like to explain to gorbachev the way we see things 
havel said in his regular weekly radio address 
at this moment we are talking not only about business and 
dollars but about stability of a country in central europe a 
country whose stability many other european countries believe in 
and depend on havel said 
czechoslovakia is introducing economic reforms designed to 
transform the centralized economy left behind by the ousted 
communists to a market economy 
czechoslovak officials held talks with soviet authorities last 
week in moscow and foreign minister jiri dienstbier raised the oil 
issue with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze during 
talks at the united nations 
havel said the threat to czechoslovakias economy could have 
farreaching negative consequences for the authority and 
prestige of the soviet union 
soviet authorities have said this years supply of oil to 
czechoslovakia will be about 26 million tons less than the 
original allotment of 166 million tons 
havel said he would emphasize in talks with gorbachev that 
czechoslovakia is making an effort in all talks dealing with the 
future of the warsaw pact and the new european peace initiative to 
respect sensitively the soviet unions interests 
if agreements are broken czechoslovakia would not feel bound to 
take excessive consideration he said 
havel said prague is also looking elsewhere for oil supplies to 
end its neartotal dependence on the soviet union 
the soviet union was for years the main oil supplier under 
subsidized conditions for czechoslovakia and other east european 
nations however next year it will begin demanding convertible 
currency for its oil

officials at the hanford nuclear reservation 
ignored a call to conduct tests on a leaking nuclearwaste storage 
tank apparently because the procedure was too expensive a retired 
hanford scientist said 
these are not inexpensive tests soils expert ronald routson 
said in an interview reported sunday in the seattle times i 
think it was dollars pure and simple 
routson said he urged hanford officials in 1978 to perform the 
tests after he noticed changes in radiation measurements in soil 
beneath the singlewalled tank which was damaged in a 1965 steam 
explosion 
the only way to know what was going on at that tank was to do 
the tests and that wasnt done said routson who retired last 
year after 23 years at hanford rockwell international was the 
governments prime contractor at hanford in southcentral 
washington until 1987 
ron gerton waste management director for the us department of 
energy in richland said the agency is fairly confident this work 
wasnt done but said he does not know why 
memos exchanged by hanford contractors and its owner the 
department of energy indicate tank 105a could have leaked more 
than a million gallons of contaminated cooling water into the 
desert soil from 1965 through 1978 
public documents initially estimated the leak at 5000 gallons 
but make no mention of cooling water that was regularly added to 
the tank until 1978 to prevent an explosion the newspaper reported 
last week 
the state department of ecology has asked the department of 
energy to provide all documentation about the 35yearold tank by 
wednesday said roger stanley manager of the state agencys 
nuclear and mixed waste program 
tank 105a is one of 177 at hanford used to store waste generated 
during four decades of plutonium production for nuclear weapons 
in a letter to hanford managers dated april 12 1978 routson 
said changing radiation measurements in the soil beneath the 
concrete structure indicated a substantial quantity of the water 
being added to the tank is leaking to the sediment up to 
570000 gallons 
he recommended tests to measure how much cooling water was 
leaking and how much was evaporating inside the tank and sampling 
the sludge in the bottom of the tank to determine its radioactive 
content 
i told my managers there were indications that radiation had 
leaked and they ought to find out whats going on routson said 
from his home in benton city 
three radiationdetection devices buried beneath the tanks are 
inadequate to properly assess how much was leaking he said 
spokesman eric campbell of westinghouse hanford which replaced 
rockwell as prime contractor at the site said current records show 
that the radioactive leak has not spread more than 100 feet from 
the tank ground water lies 285 feet below the surface 
records before 1977 have not been found campbell said

whitworth college saluted a devoted 
alumnus this weekend but nobody was surprised when the mystery man 
didnt show up for the festivities 
since 1988 the seattlearea mystery man has sent dozens of 
professors and their spouses on exotic trips all expenses paid 
following up with gifts such as cameras artwork or coffee makers 
alfred gray a retired whitworth journalism professor and his 
wife nicolin were whisked off on a trip to new zealand last fall 
and three weeks ago a local department store advised them we 
were supposed to come in and pick out a tv or sound system he 
wanted us to have gray said 
so far 28 current and former faculty members at the private 
school have been recipients of the mystery mans largesse and there 
seems to be no end in sight said paul viren director of 
whitworths development and alumni affairs office 
almost all the faculty contacts are made by laurel lindberg the 
travel agent who arranges the trips 
lindberg also accepted the whitworth college award for alumni 
devotion on the mystery mans behalf at saturdays 
homecomingweekend banquet 
no one came forward when he was invited to accept the award in 
person viren said 
lindberg said the mystery man prefers to keep himself out of 
the picture but he did give her a brief message to read 
your students have not forgotten you she quoted him as 
saying 
campus sleuths have determined that the mystery man probably 
was here in the early to mid 60s viren said 
he likely has spent more than 150000 so far on the surprise 
gifts the school official estimated 
he is certainly not doing it for the publicity or for tax 
breaks he must do it for the joy it gives him viren said

not extend to mainland china and outer mongolia said huang 
hsinchieh chairman of the democratic progressive party taiwan 
should plan its future based on its current territory he said 
huang was speaking at the opposition partys congress at a hotel 
in taoyuan 31 miles west of taipei some 170 delegates gave him a 
standing ovation 
we are merely stating a political reality huang later told 
reporters huang said his party passed the resolution despite 
threats from the ruling nationalist party whose secretarygeneral 
james soong met opposition leaders on saturday evening 
officials said the government would disband any political party 
that openly advocates taiwans existence as a state independent 
from mainland china 
the nationalists had agreed in july to political reforms 
reducing their four decadeslong grip on the country the reforms 
included allowing at some time in the near future the countrys 
first popular vote for the presidency 
advocating an indepedent taiwan is viewed as a seditious act by 
the nationalist government which fled to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to communist forces on mainland china 
the nationalists since then have limited the voting power of 
native taiwanese who make up about 80 percent of the population 
earlier on sunday president lee tenghui chaired the inaugural 
session of the national unification council a task force formed to 
assist the president in making policies on taiwans reunification 
with china 
we have never abandoned the goal of regaining mainland 
territory and completing national unification lee said 
lu yali a political science professor at national taiwan 
university said the opposition partys statement could lead to 
repression by conservative nationalists 
the pace of democratic reforms will also slow down he 
predicted

a judge denied bond on sunday for a 17yearold 
high school student charged with killing a young suburban couple 
and their unborn child in a case that had stumped police for 
months 
david j biro of winnetka was being held at cook county jail on 
two counts of firstdegree murder and one count of deliberately 
killing a fetus in the shooting deaths of richard and nancy 
langert who lived near him in the prosperous chicago suburb 
biros arrest friday followed six months of a frustrating 
multistate investigation in which police officers pursued numerous 
deadend leads including rumors that the killings might be linked 
to terrorist reprisals from irish factions 
at a hearing in cook county court judge bernard spak denied 
bond to biro who is being charged as an adult according to 
maureen mchale a spokeswoman for the cook county states attorney 
office 
biros attorney bob gewirtz said he told the judge he was 
upset that biro was held in police custody for more than 24 hours 
before being formally charged saturday evening 
apparently he had not been allowed to talk to anyone in his 
family or call an attorney during that whole time gewirtz said 
biro a senior at new trier high school lives five blocks from 
the townhouse where the couple was shot to death in the basement on 
the evening of april 8 
mrs langert was 2 months pregnant at the time of the 
shootings 
police have acknowledged that biro and the couple knew each 
other but prosecutors refused to elaborate on how well or what a 
possible motive for the killings might be 
police chief herbert timm said saturday that biro and the 
victims were acquainted but would not elaborate timm also 
said nothing in their the victims personal lives led to this 
tragedy 
evidence against biro was collected at the crime scene and in 
his home and police believe he acted alone timm said 
the chicago suntimes reported in its sunday editions that 
winnetka investigators focused on biro after he told another youth 
details of the langert slayings that had not been released 
publicly 
besides the murder charges biro is accused of burglary at his 
high school and of stealing a firearm 
a preliminary hearing is scheduled for tuesday 
langert 30 and mrs langert 25 worked at gloria jeans 
coffee bean corp a suburban arlington heightsbased chain of 
gourmet coffee shops a spokesman for the company described them as 
kids you would want to be best friends with 
the rumors of possible involvement of irish factions stemmed 
from the fact that mrs langerts sister is active in support for 
rights for the roman catholic minority in northern ireland

soviet embassy officials said more flights would be arranged to 
evacuate soviet citizens who want to return home at least 2000 
out of an estimated 5000 have expressed that desire the officials

mikhail gorbachev 
more than 11000 soviets were in iraq at the time of the 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 the last flight taking soviets home 
mostly women and children was on sept 27

under contract with the iraqi government 
the soviet unions tass news agency reported earlier that 
primakov had raised the issue of the departure from iraq of 
soviet specialists wishing to go home at the request of 
gorbachev 
the specialists were not among the foreigners held as human 
shields at hotels and strategic sites in an effort to deter 
attacks 
tass said primakov told saddam that moscow favors a political

it should have been the morning after but 
instead it seemed more like a new beginning for david duke a 
former ku klux klan grand wizard and nazi sympathizer 
duke surprised pollsters with a strong showing in the us 
senate race and took time to outline a national agenda while 
conceding defeat sunday 
ive got to be very encouraged by this election duke said 
i want to make a difference and whether its myself or other 
people out there weve got to have people up front talking about 
the issues this campaign talked about 
campaigning against affirmative action minority setasides 
busing for school integration and welfare abuse duke garnered 44 
percent of the unofficial vote in saturdays race against 54 
percent for incumbent us sen j bennett johnston 
you dont win elections with 44 percent but it makes a lot of 
politicians sit up and take notice said edward renwick of loyola 
universitys institute of politics 
about 600000 voters backed duke which represented a 
substantial widening in his political base in two years 
in his first political victory in february 1989 duke formally 
registered as a member of the republican party three days before he 
was elected to the louisiana house he won by just over 227 votes 
in a district that was 996 percent white 
running as a democrat duke was defeated for state senate in 
1975 and 1979 in 1988 he got on the presidential ballot in 15 
states as a populist party candidate winning 48267 votes or 005 
percent of the 91 million votes cast the campaign was managed by a 
former leader of the american nazi party 
as a student duke dressed in a nazi uniform at a campus protest 
and later became national grand dragon of the white knights of the 
ku klux klan 
duke left the kkk in 1980 after being accused of selling a 
secret membership list he formed the national association of white 
people and shared a telephone number with the kkk until reporters 
found out about it in 1989 
since winning election last year duke says he has moderated his 
stand he described his former klan affiliation as youthful 
hijinks 
duke said the senate race was the first in recent history 
where affirmative actin became a major issue where strong 
programs of welfare became a major issue and i think now thats 
going to happen across the country 
duke said he was studying a possible run for governor in 1991 
i certainly want to make an impact in state politics and i 
want to continue to make an impact in national politics he said 
we are committed that this cause will not cease here he 
added this is just the beginning not the end of any political 
odyssey

gubernatorial candidates dianne feinstein 
and pete wilson clashed sunday on wilsons us senate attendance 
record campaign funding and their visions for the states future 
in a bitter first debate 
feinstein the democratic former mayor of san francisco and 
republican wilson both claimed to be the candidate of new ideas 
i think theres a need for someone thats fresh new and a 
little bit different feinstein said in the live televised 
debate 
wilson said that being a republican would not handcuff him in 
sacramento where the legislature is dominated by democrats he 
also portrayed himself as a reformer 
im running for governor because i want to make changes in 
california that i think need to be made said wilson he would 
give up his senate seat if elected nov 6 to succeed retiring 
republican gov george deukmejian 
the debate quickly turned to attacks some personal 
feinstein accused wilson of having the worst attendance record 
in the congress missing votes on the death penalty supreme 
court confirmation middle east resolutions and the budget 
i think absenteeism is an important indication of 
performance said feinstein 
wilson countered that he has a 93 percent attendance record 
overall 2 percentage points better than that of sen alan 
cranston dcalif 
turning to the offensive wilson criticized feinstein for taking 
large campaign donations in the wake of a judges overturning 
proposition 73 which had limited individual donations to 1000 
he singled out feinsteins acceptance of 150000 from a 
california highway patrol organization 
dianne i am truly shocked that you would be so blind to so 
gross a conflict of interest he said 
the onehour debate televised from knbctvs studios marked 
the first time the rivals for governor have met facetoface in 
eight months and their firstever televised showdown a second and 
final televised debate is scheduled next week in san francisco 
the debate was divided into 30 minutes of questions from 
political reporters and 30 minutes in which feinstein and wilson 
questioned each other 
the two debates are especially important because wilson and 
feinstein have been virtually tied in every independent poll 
reported since they won their party nominations in the june 
primary 
much of the debates impact is expected to come in postdebate 
television and print reports 
viewership for the sunday debate was not expected to be 
particularly high because it coincided with the second game of the 
american league baseball championship series between oakland and 
boston and a los angeles raidersbuffalo bills football game next 
weeks debate will compete with two of the most popular shows on 
television the cosby show and the simpsons

a florida arms brokr is suing to recover more than 
30 million he claims is owed to him for arranging the sale of 
cluster bombs to iraq the timing his lawyer admits may be a 
little awkward 
nasser beydoun 47 of coral springs said he masterminded a 
1983 deal that enabled chilean industrialist carlos cardoen to sell 
the baghdad government at least 467 million worth of cluster bombs 
and other military equipment 
in a lawsuit filed with the circuit court in dade county 
beydoun claims cardoen often referred to him as a golden key to 
the middle east arms market 
when i opened the market he crossed the bridge and he burned 
it leaving me behind beydoun said 
cardoen 48 made a fortune selling bombs to iraq during its 
eightyear war with iran the miami herald reported saturday 
beydoun said he hooked up with cardoen in 1982 when he was 
appointed the exclusive sales representative of explosivos cardoen 
ltd in iraq lebanon and saudi arabia 
in court papers beydoun claimed he gave up a lucrative food and 
cigarette exporting business to work for cardoen whose cardoen 
industries operates a weapons factory in chile 
cardoen signed a letter of agreement and protection that 
authorized beydoun to be his exclusive agent in iraq court papers 
say 
beydouns job was to sell 500pound cluster bombs to the iraqi 
air force at 6500 apiece he was to receive 500 for each bomb 
sold 
beydoun said he spent 285000 of his own money to fly back and 
forth to baghdad the iraqis eventually agreed to buy 3000 cluster 
bombs at 7230 each he said 
cardoen sent the bombs overseas aboard an iraqi airways jet from 
santiago or by ship out of the chilean port of iquique beydoun 
said in court papers that sale put 21 million into cardoens bank 
accounts in dade county and elsewhere the lawsuit said 
the iraqis later purchased more bombs a bomb factory and 
machinery beydoun claims in the suit in all cardoen sold at 
least 467 million in war materials the suit says 
beydoun claims he is owed commissions of 359 million but has 
collected only 53 million 
beydouns attorney hendrik milne said his client tried to 
settle the dispute this summer cardoens lawyers have rejected the 
claims milne told the miami herald 
with iraqs invasion of kuwait and the buildup of us troops in 
saudi arabia a florida jury might find it difficult to side with 
someone who supplied bombs that could be used against americans 
milne said 
its not a popular case on either side he said 
on the other hand he said who are they going to prefer the 
bomb maker who kept all the money or the broker who should have 
been paid and wasnt

the soviet union has indicated it may be willing to 
return two of four disputed islands to japan to improve relations 
between the two countries news reports said sunday 
soviet officials made the proposal to a group of japanese 
lawmakers who visited moscow late last month japanese newspapers 
reported 
the territorial dispute involves the southern kuril islands off 
northern japan which were seized by the soviet union at the end of 
world war ii the dispute has prevented better ties between the two 
pacific powers and kept them from signing a peace treaty officially 
ending wartime hostilities 
the soviet officials proposed to the japanese delegation that 
the new agreement confirm a 1956 japansoviet joint declaration at 
the time moscow agreed to return shikotan island and the smaller 
habomai island group kyodo news service quoted japanese officials 
as saying 
the 1956 declaration cleared the way for a resumption of 
diplomatic relations but when japan signed a mutual security 
treaty with the united states in 1960 the soviet union declared it 
would only return the islands after all foreign troops were 
withdrawn from japan 
japan has continued to demand that all four of the disputed 
islands in the southern kurils be returned the other islands are 
kunashiri and etorofu 
the soviet union hopes that it can attract japanese investment 
and high technology assistance by settling the territorial dispute 
the nationally circulated newspaper asahi shimbun said soviet 
officials hoped to conclude the new agreement when soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev visits tokyo next spring 
asahi shimbun said the proposed agreement calls for the 
countries to cooperate in seeking international stability and 
development prepare for the conclusion of a peace treaty in three 
to five years confirm the principles of the 1956 joint 
declaration and increase economic cooperation and exchanges 
japanese government and party officials and soviet embassy 
officials were not available sunday to discuss the reports

with incantations against the ghosts of an 
earlier crisis that became a war congress finally found a way to 
applaud president bush for his current stand against iraq while 
avoiding commitments for the future 
now there are suggestions that there ought to be another 
resolution telling bush that congress wants him to consult 
regularly with its leaders after it adjourns in about 10 days to 
keep them informed on middle east operations 
but one refrain was repeated two dozen times with minor 
variations as the house and the senate briefly debated and 
overwhelmingly approved the measures last week two months after 
the fact 
this resolution is not an authorization for the use of force 
now or in the future said sen george j mitchell dmaine the 
majority leader this resolution is not a gulf of tonkin 
resolution 
the 1964 gulf of tonkin resolution still haunts the congress 
that adopted it in swift response to a reported attack at sea then 
saw it cited by the white house as the equivalent of a declaration 
of war in vietnam 
as one who voted for the gulf of tonkin resolution as 
everyone else in the house did i many times have regretted that 
vote said rep robert w kastenmeier dwis one of 25 house 
members serving then and now 
he argued that no matter what is said about the limits of the 
persian gulf resolution overwhelming approval could be read as 
unfettered congressional support for bush in whatever policy he 
chooses to pursue 
the house vote for the resolution was 380 to 29 the senate 
approved it 96 to 3 
the democrats who run congress had been trying for weeks to 
decide on a way to vote support for bushs united nations diplomacy 
and military deployment without signing on for the duration the 
congressional role in such situations always has been hard to 
define especially in the era of undeclared wars congress has 
clear authority over military appropriations but that comes after 
the fact of a quick strike or deployment 
there is a system under the war powers resolution of 1973 but 
that never has worked it requires that a president get approval 
from congress within 90 days if he sends troops into situations in 
which hostilities are imminent bush got around it simply by 
reporting that hostilities are not imminent in the middle east 
we are operating today on the false premise that our troops in 
the persian gulf are not in imminent danger said sen 
william s cohen rmaine i simply do not accept that 
sen mark o hatfield rore said friday that congress should 
invoke the war powers system by adopting a measure authorizing the 
middle east troop deployment for another 90 days thats not 
likely and it would be subject to veto anyhow 
the alternative is to go home and come back and find a 
battle and then everybodys going to be up here talking about the 
bush war hatfield said 
sen sam nunn dga suggested the call for regular white house 
consultation with congressional leaders instead he said congress 
already had implicitly authorized what the president is doing 
with its resolutions earlier in the week 
those measures declare support for continued action by the 
president to deter iraqi aggression and protect american lives 
and vital interests stipulating that it must be in accordance 
with united nations decisions and with us processes including 
congressional action to appropriate the funds 
mitchell said the senate resolution was not an authorization 
for the use of force now or in the future rep lee hamilton 
dind said the house vote does not support future actions 
except those actions that continue current policy 
for all those caveats there is no guarantee that current policy 
wont mean war

the united auto workers reached a 
tentative national labor contract early sunday with ford motor co 
that apparently follows a pattern set in negotiations with general 
motors corp 
neither the union nor ford gave details of the new contract uaw 
president owen bieber however referred to similarities between 
the ford and gm pacts 
this tentative agreement provides that uawrepresented ford 
workers will fully share in the gains achieved by the pattern 
settlement reached earlier at general motors bieber said 
ford which relies more heavily on overtime than gm and chrysler 
corp was wary about a provision in the gm agreement that pays 
workers 5 an hour extra for excessive overtime 
other provisions of the uawgm pact likely to be carried over to 
ford include 
a 3percent increase in base wages in the first year of the 
contract 
lumpsum payments equal to 3 percent of wages in the second 
and third years 
continuation in costofliving adjustments for wages 
pension improvements 
no change in healthcare provisions 
the contract will be reviewed by the ford bargaining council on 
tuesday the council made up of presidents and bargaining 
committee heads at the uaws 79 local unions at ford plants and 
offices must approve it before the contract is sent out for 
ratification among fords 100000 uaw members 
jack hall fords chief negotiator said the contract has been 
achieved at a time when the competition in our industry has never 
been tougher the cyclical nature of our business is a hard fact of 
life and world events have heightened economic uncertainties 
in all uaw contracts with the big three cover more than 450000 
active workers 
the agreement with ford and its apparent similiarity with the 
gm contract puts additional pressure on chrysler where about 
60000 hourly and salaried workers are covered by the uaw contract 
the union has insisted that a contract it reaches with one of 
the companies will be the model for the other two chrysler has 
said the gm agreement appears to be very expensive

sale of the state phone company 
entel was postponed for up to one month sunday because the 
government could not agree to final terms with the us and 
european buyers 
after insisting for a year the sale would take place oct 8 to 
coincide with the birthday of party founder juan domingo peron 
president carlos menem said the transfer now will take place from 
15 days to a month from now 
a main obstacle is entels rate structure public works minister 
jose dromi told reporters during breaks in negotiations that lasted 
all weekend 
thirtyone percent of customers bills is taxed to support the 
national pension fund purchasers want the tax removed or the 
government to hike rates an equivalent amount before they take 
over 
also customers and many politicians are outraged by the 42 
percent rate increase that took effect sept 24 bringing hikes 
this year to near 2400 percent 
that assures the private companies a profitability much higher 
than stipulated by the bid specifications said peronist party 
sen liliana gurdulich chairwoman of the bicameral state reform 
committee that monitors the sale of public companies 
sale of the empresa nacional de telecomunicaciones is one of the 
biggest privatization projects in the world 
the aging moneylosing system of 3 million lines and 46000 
employees is to be divided into two sections 
investors have agreed to pay 594 million in cash and notes and 
retire 5 billion of argentinas foreign debt for 60 percent of 
entel 
the debtequity swap is a way for the government to reduce a 66 
billion foreign debt and for banks to get at least some value for 
loans trading on secondary markets as low as 12 cents on the 
dollar 
problems cropped up last thursday when a group led by usbased 
manufacturers hanover bank and philadelphiabased telephone company
