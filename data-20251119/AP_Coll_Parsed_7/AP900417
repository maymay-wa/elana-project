president bush warned tuesday of appropriate 
responses if moscow imposes announced cuts in fuel supplies to 
lithuania but also said he does not want to damage superpower 
relations 
a soviet journalist meanwhile was quoted as saying moscow 
would cancel the cuts the journalist denied having made the remark 
i want to be sure anything we do is productive bush said 
theres been dramatic change in the world and i dont want to 
inadvertently take some action that would set it back 
the soviet government said it had ordered drastic cuts in 
natural gas supplies to lithuania on tuesday followed by cuts in 
oil and gasoline on wednesday us officials said they could not 
confirm any slowdown 
but by tuesday night a soviet journalist was reported as saying 
soviet president mikhali s gorbachev would revoke the order 
vladimir matyash the washington bureau chief of the soviet news 
agency tass told cia director william webster the order was a 
mistake and that that president gorbachev will have an 
announcement tomorrow revoking that according to national public 
radio 
the conversation took place at a reception held by the public 
broadcasting system the npr account said webster had raised the 
issue with the soviet journalist eliciting his reply 
when asked how he knew gorbachevs intentions matyash replied 
you can be sure its true i have a direct line to moscow 
according to npr 
the npr reporter daniel schorr said he overhead the 
webstermatyash conversation and both knew he was there 
but matyash said later schorrs account was not accurate 
what i said and what i meant was there was no confirmation 
from moscow that moscow would exercise the sanctions that 
gorbachev announced the interruption gas supplies 
schorr misunderstood me please kill the story matyash said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and minority 
leader bob dole rkan conferred separately with bush about 
increased tensions in lithuania 
i think its a very serious matter a very serious delicate 
situation mitchell said afterward 
mitchell said that based on what happens in lithuania bush 
should review whether the united states proceeds with closer 
cooperation with moscow on trade tax matters and the environment 
i regard the action taken by the soviets as wrong mitchell 
said 
lawmakers have warned that congress might act on its own with 
economic pressure against moscow if the soviets escalate efforts to 
block lithuanias drive for independence 
bush took a twopronged approach of warning and conciliation as 
the administration waited to see if moscow carried out threats of 
economic sanctions against the breakaway baltic republic 
responding to the latest news bush said the united states was 
monitoring developments very very closely and we are waiting to 
see if the soviet announcements are implemented 
clearly those announcements are contrary to the approach that 
we have urged and that others have urged upon the soviet union 
bush said we are considering appropriate responses if these 
threats are implemented 
he refused to elaborate saying i would simply repeat that 
what we need is dialogue discussion and a peaceful resolution of 
this great difficulty there 
bush made his comments during a picturetaking session in the 
oval office with visiting president rafael l callejas of honduras 
separately the white house released the transcript of an interview 
conducted monday with foreign journalists 
on lithuania bush said in the interview that any us reaction 
to soviet economic pressures against the baltic republic should be 
productive and should not risk a setback in reforms championed by 
gorbachev 
and yet bush said i dont want to be seen as one who is 
not interested in the peaceful change and in the selfdetermination 
for lithuania 
in recent weeks highlevel us officials have been meeting to 
consider what steps the administration might take in response to 
various soviet actions against lithuania most of the options 
apparently involve economic measures such as denying moscow 
improved trade status or blocking its entry into international 
economic organizations 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler asked if the 
administration had compiled a list of options said if there 
were i would not be prepared to answer that question 
she said bushs fiveday summit with gorbachev beginning may 30 
still was planned 
she praised the lithuanians for making an effort to resolve 
the dispute through dialogue and again urged the soviets to 
peacefully engage the leaders of the independenceminded baltic 
republic 
a us official said privately that the united states probably 
would not try to make up the fuel losses for lithuania since the 
soviets would have to give permission for us deliveries and that 
would defeat the purpose of moscows sanctions

a jailhouse journalist serving a life 
sentence for cutting a bank tellers throat and shooting two others 
after a holdup again is vying for freedom but the governor said 
tuesday the inmate is wasting his time 
inmate wilbert rideau has gained fame as the editor of the 
awardwinning angolite the louisiana state penitentiary magazine 
but that hasnt helped his attempts at freedom 
in december 1988 gov buddy roemer rejected the louisiana 
pardon boards recommendation of clemency for rideau whos been 
locked up for 29 years 
asked if he had changed his mind roemer said at this moment 
i have not 
on wednesday rideau intends to make his seventh request for 
clemency before the pardon board 
rideau 48 was sentenced to die in the electric chair for the 
murder of gulf national bank teller julia ferguson after an armed 
robbery in the southwest louisiana town of lake charles in 1961 
rideau then 19 used a pistol to get away with 14279 stuffed 
into a suitcase he forced two tellers and the branch manager all 
of whom he knew into a car drove them to a deserted road and shot 
all three when mrs ferguson begged for her life rideau cut her 
throat and stabbed her in the heart she was the only one who died 
in 1973 his term was commuted to life in prison without parole 
after the us supreme court overturned the death penalty 
rideaus prison prose earned the angolite and its editor 
national acclaim including the robert f kennedy journalism award 
the american bar associations silver gavel award and the george 
polk award for special interest reporting 
it also has allowed him to travel with guards two weeks ago 
rideau went to the american society of newspaper editors meeting 
in washington dc to speak about prison journalism 
he says he has offers of journalism jobs if he can get out of 
prison but he worries that his case attracts so much attention it 
puts extra pressure on the governor 
in 1984 the pardon board voted to cut rideaus sentence to time 
served but then gov edwin edwards rejected clemency two years 
later the board voted to cut rideaus sentence to 60 years but 
edwards refused to sign the release 
in 1988 a newly appointed board affirmed the 60year sentence 
but roemer turned rideau down each time the governor cited strong 
objections from survivors of the crime 
when rideau presents his appeal this time he will back it up 
with a study from loyola university in new orleans that raises the 
issue that he is black and the victim was white 
the rideau report as it is called says every black man 
convicted of murdering a white person in calcasieu parish over an 
88year period was sentenced to death when capital punishment was 
an option lake charles is the calcasieu parish seat 
linda labranche an assistant professor of english said only 26 
percent of 101 calcasieu parish murder convictions between 1889 and 
1976 resulted in death sentences however all 13 black men 
convicted of killing whites were condemned to death 
the fact that a death sentence was given to every single black 
man convicted of murdering a white in calcasieu parish from the 
parishs earliest recorded history to a full 15 years after the 
1961 conviction of rideau points decidedly to a separate and 
unequal system of justice which existed for offenders in this 
category labranche said 
rideaus appearance before the board comes two days after the 
us supreme court cleared the way for the execution of a retarded 
man for the 1977 murder of a louisiana state trooper the court 
listed a stay of execution it granted four months ago and voted 72 
monday to deny the appeals by dalton prejean 30 who has been on 
death row since 1978 longer than any other inmate in louisiana 
no new execution date was set for prejean who was less than 
eight hours away from the electric chair in november when the high 
court granted the stay and agreed to consider his case

employees of the department of 
education catnap in the darkened corners while their supervisor 
moves her desk closer to the window to work in the sunlight 
problem no electricity 
at the main ticketing office of philippine airlines wouldbe 
travelers lounge on the stairs waiting until the power returns so 
airline employees can process their tickets 
such scenes are repeated daily in this tropical city of 8 
million people who are enduring a grave electricity crisis during 
the hottest season of the year 
the shortage has become so critical that the government has 
announced a limited fourday work week starting next monday for 
state offices and buildings that use more than 100 kilowatts a day 
infrastructure problems are nothing new to filipinos who must 
cope with a haphazard telephone system chaotic traffic potholed 
streets and an unreliable water system 
in november the city went through a similar power crisis that 
abated after a failed coup the following month but with demand 
increasing in the torrid summer months the daily brownouts are 
back in fury 
nothing illustrates the collapse of infrastructure during 
president corazon aquinos 4yearold administration more 
graphically than the electricity crisis it is a problem that 
affects virtually every household 
power is cut in commercial and residential districts for up to 
eight hours a day perishable food spoils in refrigerators and 
traffic snarls when stoplights fail 
without air conditioning offices and homes turn to ovens as 
temperatures hover near 100 degrees 
in the citys entertainment district scantily clad dancers at 
one club perform their bumps and grinds in the sweltering darkness 
the clubs generator can power the stereo but not the lights and 
air conditioner 
to make matters worse manila is also facing a critical water 
shortage due to a drought on luzon island and the antiquated state 
of the citys waterworks 
luis sison administrator of the metropolitan waterworks and 
sewerage system says 40 percent of the water is being lost because 
of leaks in the mains some of which date back to 1892 
sison says renovation work began in 1987 but will not be 
complete until mid1992 when mrs aquinos term expires 
earlier this month the staterun national power corp 
acknowledged that 12 of the 22 generating plants on luzon island 
were not working due to maintenance requirements storm damage or 
low water levels at hydroelectric dams those 22 plants generate 
2982 megawatts of which 80 percent is consumed in greater manila 
deogracias peralta vice president of the power corporation 
said plans call for using coalfired and geothermal plants to 
provide the foundation of the citys electricity system 
but he said the system will not be fully operational until 1993 
critics blame the aquino government for the crisis which the 
national power corp had been predicting for three years 
under the late president ferdinand marcos the government 
contracted with the westinghouse corp to build a 630megawatt 
nuclear power plant on the bataan peninsula 
the plants capability was about the same as the shortfall in 
generating capability but marcos opponents alleged the plant was 
unsafe and that westinghouse paid bribes to win the contract 
westinghouse denies both allegations 
during the 186 election campaign against marcos mrs aquino 
vowed that if she were elected the plant would never operate it 
was a vow she kept 
the presidential staff also stalled on proposals by the national 
power corp to buy expensive gas turbines as a shortterm solution 
columnist gabby manalac recommended in the business star 
newspaper that instead of power cuts and shortened work weeks the 
government mandate a comprehensive conservation plan including 
limiting use of air conditioners and outoor neon lighting 
but in a country where many laws are only loosely enforced 
prospects for an effective energysaving program appear dim

four democrats who would be iowas 
governor parried and argued for 90 minutes never mentioning the 
word abortion 
but within hours two of them cited the overwhelming need for 
prochoice activists to unite and joined forces in a single ticket 
it was just one example of how candidates have struggled with a 
political and emotional issue some admit they arent quite sure how 
to handle strategists argue about how the volatile abortion issue 
will play in the iowa campaign but none dispute its standing on 
the political agenda 
its playing out there said iowa democratic party spokesman 
joe shannahan people are talking about it at county 
conventions 
there now are three major democratic candidates running for the 
nomination in the partys june 5 primary the winner will take on 
twoterm republican gov terry branstad who is seeking another 
fouryear term 
running are attorney general tom miller house speaker don 
avenson and retired des moines banker and longtime party activist 
john chrystal the field was narrowed when lt gov joann zimmerman 
dropped from the race to take the no 2 spot on avensons ticket 
some prochoice activists worry that chrystal and avenson will 
slice up the prochoice vote and that antiabortion forces will 
cross over to vote for miller in the primary assuring that two 
abortion foes are running in the fall election 
at this time last year the issue was seemingly settled miller 
a statewide officeholder for a dozen years held a commanding lead 
in the polls in money and in a superior campaign organization 
hes also a roman catholic with staunch antiabortion views 
when the supreme court handed the issue back to the states last 
summer his standing in the polls began to slide 
the most recent polls published by the des moines register 
showed millers support below the 35 percent needed to win the 
nomination if no candidate garners 35 percent the democratic 
nominee would be selected in june by delegates to the partys state 
convention 
with less than two months to go before the primary polls 
indicate that roughly onethird of the democrats planning to vote 
still are undecided 
our concern out there is confusion said avenson its 
difficult for prochoice voters to make a decision 
shannahan said the undecided group may be even larger 
id say a clear majority havent made up their mind or are 
willing to change their mind he said they havent really 
focused on who theyre going to support 
activists tired from years of marathon campaigning because of 
iowas firstinthenation precinct caucuses are only now beginning 
to return after an extended leave from politics he said 
the tenor of the campaign has shifted as well in the early days 
after the supreme court decision the prochoice candidates were 
fond of showing up at rallies waving coat hangers and trying to 
outdo each other theyve stuck with their positions but toned down 
the rhetoric 
miller said that shows the issue is cooling iowans are moving 
beyond that issue he said iowans are not singleissue 
voters 
branstad takes an antiabortion position although he has been 
far from active during the last legislative session he asked for 
no new restrictions and was vague about what he would sign 
although polls pitting branstad against potential rivals have 
him ahead the governors camp points to figures showing the state 
has 548000 registered democrats 476000 republicans and 474000 
voters who registered without expressing a party preference 
when you know the other side can potentially turn out that 
many more folks youve got to be nervous said david roederer 
who runs branstads reelection effort on any given day if all 
their folks show up and all your folks show up and nobody else 
shows up you probably wont win 
as a result branstad has turned his attention to piling up 
money he has raised more than 16 million three times the 
combined total of all the democrats who are spending their money 
in the primary fight

two of washingtons most famous landmarks the 
lincoln and jefferson memorials are slowly crumbling under the 
ravaging effects of water seepage air pollution littering 
tourists and a pesky little bug called the midge experts say 
private consultants hired by the national park service say the 
most glaring problem was found at the 68yearold lincoln memorial 
where dripping rainwater has caused deterioration of huge concrete 
slabs that support a broad cobblestone walkway and the grassy 
terrace surrounding the building 
at the jefferson memorial completed in 1943 cracks have been 
detected in the concrete shell of the inner dome officials also 
are worried that the main plaza and marble steps may be sliding 
gradually into the waters of the tidal basin 
the park service said none of the problems is serious enough to 
require immediate attention or pose a safety hazard to visitors 
both memorials are in excellent shape overall and we want to 
assure they stay that way said assistant park service 
superintendent vikki mcgraw there is absolutely no danger to the 
public 
said rebecca stevens historical architect for the park 
services national capital region at this point im sure theyd 
be standing for another 200 years even if we did nothing 
nevertheless the team of outside architects and structural 
engineers commissioned to make an exhaustive 2 million study of 
both monuments concluded that repairs must begin in the next few 
years 
the increasingly toxic effects of nature have begun to erode 
this totally exposed monument the consultants said in a report 
issued after a yearlong inspection they were referring to the 
lincoln memorial but used nearly identical terms to describe the 
jefferson memorial 
if steps are not taken immediately to determine a specific 
course of action nature will continue to destroy this memorial 
they said very serious structural problems exist right now 
park service officials say they hope to award a major repair 
contract in 1993 after further tests the consultants estimated 
total costs at 12 million 
the lincoln memorial attracted nearly 15 million visitors last 
year making it the second most popular national monument in 
downtown washington after the vietnam veterans memorial which 
drew nearly 26 million tourists the jefferson memorial was 
visited by 924000 people 
this week officials started an experimental onehour delay in 
nighttime lighting of the lincoln memorial in an attempt to 
discourage a messy infestation of midges small winged insects that 
breed in the muddy flats of the nearby potomac river 
swarming into the air at dusk for mating the midges are 
attracted by the memorials lights and smash into its limestone and 
marble walls splattering them with egg masses the protein remains 
of the midges attract spiders which in turn lure sparrows and 
starlings to the scene 
as a result park service crews must give the great marble 
statue of abraham lincoln and adjacent walls and floors a daily 
scrubbing 
if we can solve the midge problem we probably will go a long 
way to solving the bird problem said ms stevens 
the park service also has installed four electronic sensors in 
the dome of the jefferson memorial to make hourly measurements of 
the cracks in its concrete shell the signals are radioed to a 
computer in texas to help scientists determine whether the cracks 
are a symptom of the domes instability or a natural response to 
structural stresses 
ms stevens said the problem of bird deposits is compounded by 
tourist droppings of food chewing gum and especially carbonated 
soft drinks which have the corrosive effect of liquid acid on a 
marble facade 
the monuments also have suffered steadily from acid rain jet 
fuel exhaust from planes using national airport and the fumes from 
tourist buses idling their engines in nearby parking lots 
by far the greatest threat to the marble and limestone 
buildings ms stevens said is water rainwater groundwater 
rising from the former swampland on which the two memorials were 
built and the water used to hose them clean 
the eroding effects of water seepage appear most dramatically in 
the dank cavernous undercroft of the lincoln memorial curtains of 
stalactites hang from cracks and joints in the ceiling where the 
crumbling concrete has exposed rusting reinforcing rods 
ms stevens said the park service has drastically reduced the 
volume of water used to wash the monuments in recent years 
we will need to educate the public to understand that these 
buildings may not appear as pristine white in the future as they 
once did because well be using less water to clean them she 
said

fear on the bronx streets where five cabbies 
have been slain in the last five weeks is running so high that even 
a rumor of another shooting led hundreds of drivers to tie up 
traffic in protest 
between 400 and 500 of them parked their cabs in the street and 
turned on their lights monday afternoon after someone broadcast a 
false report over their radios that another driver had been shot 
said police officer fred weiner 
scores of drivers have quit stayed home or refused to drive at 
night because of the slayings three of which have been described 
by police as the work of a serial killer 
this guy hes freaking us out i went to church to pray for 
all my companions that nothing would happen to them said driver 
randy martinez 
at the seaman car service employer of the latest victim black 
flags flew monday from the antennas of cabs and drivers held a 
memorial procession 
the latest attack on saturday and another three days earlier 
were dismissed by police as unrelated to the first three but they 
heightened fears in an area where cab drivers have not felt safe 
for decades 
in 1989 about half of the 32 cab driver killings citywide 
occurred in the bronx police said 
a task force of about 30 police officers has been assigned to 
investigate mayor david dinkins has offered a 10000 reward for 
information leading to the killers 
the terror spree began march 7 in each of the first three 
shootings a man phoned a car service requesting a cab and then 
killed the driver with a shot to the head from a 22caliber gun 
and robbed him 
the first three are connected and the last two are not said 
officer ralph st just a police spokesman police wont explain 
exactly why 
some car service companies have lost up to 80 percent of their 
drivers at night because of fear caused by the deaths said tony 
carter spokesman for the taxi and limousine commission which 
licenses cabs in the city 
angel bello a dispatcher for seaman said dispatchers were 
serving only regular customers or patrons who clearly know where 
they are going onethird of the monday night workforce showed up 
he said 
at the flash car service co only 15 of the 80 drivers who 
normally work sunday nights showed said dispatcher pablo feliciano 
most of them are switching to the days he said theyre 
really disturbed about whats going on everybodys shaken up

too much tv can make children fat and more 
violent the american academy of pediatrics says 
in its first policy statement on children and tv since 1984 the 
39000member academy monday that parents should cut their 
childrens tv viewing which averages as much as 23 hours a week 
at least in half 
heavy tv watching contributes substantially to childhood obesity 
and is one cause of violent or aggressive behavior the academy 
said 
dr victor strasburger a member of the committee that prepared 
the policy statement complained tv offers a steady diet of 
violence causing some youngsters to believe that if youre the 
good guy violence can be acceptable to solve problems 
explaining the link to obesity strasburger of the university 
of new mexico school of medicine said tv watching is a sedentary 
activity kids usually eat in front of the set and the 
nutritional messages on television are so terrible 
the policy statement credits a 1985 study by drs wh dietz and 
sl gortmaker that appeared in the journal pediatrics dietz also 
a committee member has done followup research 
the pediatricians said ac nielsen co data indicate children 2 
to 5 watch tv about 25 hours weekly 6 to 11yearolds more than 
22 hours weekly and 12to 17yearolds 23 hours weekly 
by the time a child reaches 70 the doctors concluded he or she 
will have spent about seven years watching tv 
for some children the world shown on television becomes the 
real world the academy said 
among the academys recommendations 
limiting childrens viewing to one to two hours a day and 
developing activities such as reading sports and hobbies 
supporting legislation making highquality childrens shows a 
condition of license renewal and mandating at least one hour per 
day of educational programming 
william johnson deputy chief of the federal communications 
commissions mass media bureau said networks have reduced tv 
violence with more characters negotiating to solve problems 
in new york cbs spokeswoman anne morfogen said the network had 
not seen the academys statement and had no comment abc and nbc 
representatives had gone for the day or were otherwise unavailable 
late monday

awarded legally but poorly 
kemp announced the action monday after paul a adams inspector 
general of the department of housing and urban development said 
the federal housing finance board contracts provided necessary work 
but were not well administered 
in a memo to board director mary k bush kemp asked that eight 
recommendations adams made in his report on the contract 
investigation be implemented immediately they include establishing 
written competitive contracting guidelines hiring a chief 
contracting officer and adopting policies for employee ethics and 
hiring of outside consultants 
kemp in an interview with the associated press said the report 
puts to rest any suggestions that there was inappropriate 
conduct he said he was not particularly pleased with the 
possible appearance of impropriety raised by the nobid contracts 
ms bush gave friends but that he stood by her 
at the same time he said he was temporarily assigning a hud 
attorney to the board as my administrative assistant or executive 
assistant for two or three months 
kemp effectively controls the finance agency because he is the 
only named member of its fivemember board he recruited ms bush 
with the promise she would be nominated board chairwoman but two 
weeks ago she agreed to be the agencys managing director after 
being told she would not be nominated she had been serving as 
acting director 
the agency created as part of last years savings and loan 
bailout legislation oversees the 12 regional federal home loan 
banks and controls up to 100 million a year in housing funds 
aides said kemp asked for the contracts review in midmarch 
immediately after hud officials became aware of the nobid 
contracts ms bush awarded to friends with whom she served in the 
reagan administration they included wendell gunn who later served 
for several months as kemps hud chief of staff 
but an internal hud memo obtained later by the ap showed that 
hud undersecretary alfred a dellibovi was aware that gunn was 
being paid by the agency in early february dellibovis memo 
mentioning payments to gunn was sent to six kemp aides including 
his two top deputies 
the memo was not addressed to kemp and aides have said he did 
not see it but kemp acknowledged monday that he should have called 
in adams to investigate sooner 
i admit that we should have jumped on this in february kemp 
said was i late yes 
kemp said he was aware months ago that gunn had been helping ms 
bush get the finance agency up and running but i thought it was 
more informal than formal i did not know about the process or 
the contract but i assumed that we were following the right 
procedure 
kemp was not specific but his comments indicated contrary to 
statements by aides that he became aware of the gunn contract 
before the other two contracts 
whether i did it too late or too early is perhaps subject to 
criticism but i dont think that the gunn contract alone 
required me to call for an investigation he is an honorable 
person the hud secretary said 
kemp said he called for the review after learning that one of 
the nobid contracts went to attorney margery waxman a former 
treasury department official who represented charles keating in his 
thensuccessful 1988 effort to convince regulators not to seize his 
california savings and loan 
in a letter to keating released by a congressional committee 
waxman said she had pressured regulators into accepting keatings 
positions the subsequent failure of keatings lincoln savings and 
loan is expected to cost taxpayers some 25 billion 
the waxman letter and her connection to keating ran the flag 
up kemp said whether it is late or early the fact is that 
the ig inspector general report says there was nothing wrong in 
hiring these people 
adams said in his report that gunn waxman and the third 
recipient of a nobid contract the consulting firm of mckinsey amp 
co all provided necessary and beneficial work to the housing 
board which adams said was shortstaffed in late 1989 when ms 
bush awarded the contracts 
but adams said poor management by housing finance board 
officials allowed the consultants to work without signed agreements 
and with little oversight from agency officials 
the three contracts totaled nearly 200000 adams questioned 
only 937 of that he said waxmans law firm sidley amp austin 
could not support 426 in billed copying services and had 
improperly charged the board 511 for work related to its contract 
negotiations with the agency

millions of taxed procrastinators on monday rustled their 
receipts coaxed their calculators and battered aspirin bottles 
before doing the annual tax deadline dash to the post office 
but tax day 1990 was marred by violence outside a post office 
in the detroit suburb of royal oak mich a bomb inside an 
envelope addressed to tax thieves exploded injuring a postal 
worker officials said 
the worker whod been collecting lastminute tax returns was 
treated at a hospital and released federal law enforcement 
officers were investigating 
from olympia wash where a piano player was set up at the main 
post office to serenade the frantic to long lines in philadelphia 
taxpayers grappled with tax day april 16 a day later than usual 
because the 15th fell on a sunday 
its a zoo and circus combined thats what its like 
tonight said decatur ga postmaster crawford lovett who was 
helping collect tax returns from motorists outside the post office 
this is just fun 
a group of about 15 or 20 tax protesters carrying signs 
indicated they were against the use of tax revenues to finance 
nuclear weapons paraded outside the post office at one point 
lovett said 
tonights a gorgeous night and the attitude of the people is 
almost like its the right thing to do he said of lastminute 
filers its as if they have a civil right to procrastinate and 
theyre just exercising their right 
the irs did not estimate how many couples and individuals waited 
until the last minute but the agency predicted that about 34 
million returns more than 30 percent of the 111 million expected 
this year would be filed after april 6 
the irs form 4868 was one of the mostsought pieces of paper in 
the nation monday as an estimated 6 million americans abandoned 
hopes of meeting the midnight deadline filing a form 4868 along 
with a check for estimated taxes owed extends the return deadline 
to aug 15 
michigans top tax man state treasurer robert bowman was among 
the procrastinators monday 
morning services easter egg hunts and taxes thats how i 
spent my weekend bowman said it proves beyond a shadow of a 
doubt that we are a nation of procrastinators 
i always wait until the last minute to do my own taxes 
because i spend the first three months of the year worrying about 
everyone elses bowman said but i always get a refund 
in olympia wash a piano player was stationed at the main post 
office monday night coffee and cookies also were being offered 
its the second year they have had the festivities we had so 
much fun last year that we decided to do it again this year said 
postmaster michael loe 
in new york city several hundred people milled around outside 
the main post office in midtown manhattan and hundreds more were 
outside 
dozens of people stood on lines while others sat in chairs set 
up for the occasion filling out forms with calculators in hand 
traffic was backed up for blocks as people doubleparked to mail 
their forms and rubbernecked at the commotion others sprinted up 
the front steps forms in hand 
were expecting a minimum of 15000 people said postal 
service spokeswoman diane todd thats compared to an average 
daily figure of 3000 to 4000 
actress meg carpenter 31 explained i want to keep my money 
as long as i can 
in philadelphia taxpayers lined up outside an irs office for 
lastminute help and the processing center braced for the arrival 
of millions of returns from the eastern seaboard 
today is crazy said jim wondolowski spokesman for the 
philadelphia office we had people lined up and out the door 
before we opened the door they were here for lastminute questions 
and actual preparation the majority are coming in to have their 
taxes prepared 
luckily tax freedom day isnt far off thats the hypothetical 
day as calculated by the washington dcbased tax foundation 
on which all federal state and local taxes would be paid if all 
income were earmarked for taxes 
the tax foundation said the average person would have to work 
125 days in 1990 through may 5 to pay all taxes 
and procrastinators in new england and new york state were given 
another day to wait they file their returns to the irs claims

a new report by the agriculture department 
says most of the nations cropland already is being farmed under 
some kind of crop rotation program 
one of the highly touted features of the administrations farm 
bill proposal is more flexibility to allow farmers greater choice 
in what to plant without losing commodity program benefits 
advocates also say flexibility would permit more crop rotation 
and the advantages of natural fertility enhancement instead of high 
reliance on commercial fertilizers and other chemicals 
according to a report in the april issue of farmline magazine 
usda economists stan daberkow and mohinder gill studied the 
threeyear rotations of seven major crops because there is 
concern that continuous cropping is a prevalent practice among 
farmers 
such monoculture farming may require the use of agricultural 
chemicals to replace essential crop nutrients in order to achieve 
steady yields year to year the report said 
on the average 80 percent or more of the land in major field 
crops in 1988 was included in a crop rotation plan using five to 10 
cropping patterns over a threeyear period in some states 
however only two or three cropping patterns were used 
the exception is cotton the report said about 50 percent 
of the 1988 cotton acreage had been used continuously for that crop 
for at least three years 
rotation with soybeans alfalfa and other legumes increases the 
nitrogen content of the soil providing a natural fertilizer also 
the report noted plant diseases insects and weeds can be reduced 
by not planting the same crop year after year and that cuts back 
on the need for pesticides 
crop rotations can help protect the soil from erosion and 
moisture losses and the soils organic matter and waterholding 
capacity may also be increased the report said 
daberkow and gill also found good economic reasons for rotating 
crops soil fertility and preservation can contribute to higher 
yields and a chance for larger profits moreover different 
combinations of crops can help reduce risks 
but despite the benefits attributed to crop rotations about 
20 percent of us farmland is continuously planted with the same 
crop the report said in some areas alternative crops are not 
feasible because of climate conditions 
it added in other cases planting in rotations is not 
economically sound because of investments in equipment and 
expertise 
the daberkowgill study looked at threeyear cropping patterns 
on land used for corn winter and spring wheat soybeans rice 
fall potatoes and cotton 
most cropland was involved in some type of rotation during the 
previous two years the report said exceptions were the 1988 crops 
of cotton in arkansas louisiana texas and mississippi irrigated 
corn in nebraska winter wheat in oklahoma soybeans in mississippi 
and rice in california

an auburn university scientist has been given 
permission by the agriculture department to conduct field tests of 
cabbage and broccoli that have been genetically engineered to glow 
officials said monday a permit has been issued to joseph shaw 
an assistant professor of botany and microbiology to begin the 
tests this month in macon county ala 
shaw transferred a set of genes having a code for 
bioluminescence from a marine organism into bacteria that causes 
black rot a major disease of plants in the cabbage and broccoli 
family 
after infecting plants with the luminescent black rot bacteria 
the diseased plant parts will glow allowing scientists to trace 
the progress of the disease through the plant 
one of the benefits of the process will be the observation of 
the diseases progress without destroying the plants shaw said in 
a report released here 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service which issued the permit said a 
review showed the proposed field tests will pose no agricultural 
or human hazard 
in nature the microorganism vibrio fischeri enjoys a 
symbiotic relationship with fish for which it produces light 
the agency said scientists suspect the fish use the glowing 
microorganisms to communicate with each other

milk production in the first three months of 
1990 was up about 1 percent from the first quarter of 1989 
according to the latest agriculture department figures 
the us total was reported monday at about 369 billion pounds 
in the first quarter compared with less than 365 billion pounds a 
year earlier 
in the 21 major dairy states which account for about 85 percent 
of the us total output was reported at 313 billion pounds the 
number of cows on farms was shown at 851 million head down 27000 
from a year earlier 
the average milk output per cow in the 21 states was 1291 
pounds in march up 23 pounds from march 1989 
department analysts forecast us milk production this year may 
rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last years 1443 billion pounds 
the high milk prices of late 1989 and early 1990 have provided 
a financial boost to dairy farmers and a stimulus to production

americans and soviets dont know each other 
well enough yet to explore mars together and it would be too risky 
to attempt such a joint venture now a new study says 
the united states and ussr have no prior experience with 
the degree of cooperation necessary to carry out a technical 
project of this complexity or magnitude a committee of the 
national research council reported monday 
the two countries dont have a history of cooperation 
relatively few lines of communication and little knowledge of the 
others technical and management practices the report said 
the demonstrated stability of the relationship is such as to 
at least raise concerns at this time about relying on the 
consistency of the relationship over a period of a decade or more 
into the future it added 
in view of those risks the panel recommended instead that the 
two nations follow a graceful path of coordinated but 
independent exploration that it said would lead to increasingly 
close levels of cooperation 
the report appeared to chill the idea frequently advanced by 
space experts that mars be explored jointly by the soviets and 
united states using robotic vehicles that would scoop up soil and 
rocks and bring them to earth for study 
there have been suggestions that the two nations share the cost 
and technical requirements of four to six such missions 
one scenario often mentioned is that one nation would build a 
lander and a samplereturn vehicle while the other would develop a 
roving vehicle for collecting samples and analyzing them 
the committee said it reached its conclusions after considering 
these three levels of us participation with the soviets in a mars 
venture 
each country conducting programs independently 
the cost would be too high the returns would be less than 
maximum us technology would benefit greatly and there would be 
no additional risk of transferring technology to the soviets the 
committee said 
that approach also could ignite a space competition similar to 
the race to the moon it said 
split responsibilities and joint technical operations 
a commitment by both nations to a fully cooperative venture 
would have a greater presumably positive impact on ussoviet 
relations than would options involving lesser degrees of 
interactions and reliance the committee said 
such a venture would allow the nations to share costs while 
increasing returns and to take advantage of the best of both 
nations space programs such as the soviets lead in heavylift 
launch capability 
but a mission highly dependent on cooperative efforts would be a 
potential hostage to political events that might disrupt 
communications and interaction between the two nations said the 
committee 
a highly coordinated exploration program 
the two sides would work together at all stages said the 
report however the two sides would conduct their own 
selfcontained and independently designed missions 
there would be cooperation in analyzing samples and the cost 
would be cut in half because each side would need to commit to only 
half of the needed missions said the committee and there would 
be no risk of mission failure due to technical management or 
political failures 
thee is a danger that the cooperation could deteriorate into a 
race for mars the committee said but the competition might even 
be helpful if the schedule is planned and paced properly

a solid majority of brazilians 
support the governments crash economic plan which has brought 
inflation down from a record 5000 percent but also cost hundreds 
of thousands of people their jobs 
i couldnt go on the way it was before with inflation down 
ive got at least a little bit of money in my pocket said 
denilson goncalves who sells baked goods on the street of a 
middleclass neighborhood in rio 
goncalves views were reflected in a public opinion poll 
conducted last week in brazils 10 largest cities that indicated 71 
percent approval conducted by the prominent folha de sao paulo 
newspaper it surveyed 5291 people and had a 2 percent margin of 
error 
but support for the plan has dropped 10 percent from a similar 
survey conducted three weeks ago reflecting a growing concern over 
a rapid rise in unemployment 
president fernando collor de mello initiated the plan on march 
16 a day after taking office its heart is an 18month freeze on 
bank accounts with more than the equivalent of 1200 and a limit 
on money market withdrawals to 600 or 20 percent of the account 
whichever is greater 
the move took an estimated 115 billion out of circulation 
overnight and sent the economy into a tailspin with the 
automobile construction and other industries virtually paralyzed 
collor said the measures were drastic but necessary to bring 
down inflation that reached nearly 5000 percent over the past year 
on monday economics minister zelia cardoso de mello said prices 
have fallen over the last month and that the plan has already 
resulted in an increase in real wages of up to 18 percent 
the plan has been especially popular with the poor of this 
country of 150 million people who were not directly hit by the 
bank freeze it has been most harshly criticized by the wealthy 
who have seen their savings frozen 
but anger is also growing among the working class as well an 
estimated 1 million brazilians have been fired taken steep salary 
cuts or been put on collective holiday since the plan was 
announced 
what good is low inflation if i dont have money to buy 
anything asked aloisio porfilho reyes who was laid off in late 
march as a security guard 
reyes 47 said he doesnt know how he will feed his wife and 
five children 
before collors plan we had terrible inflation but at least i 
had a paycheck evey week he said as he waited in a long line at 
the labor ministry in downtown rio to apply for unemployment 
benefits 
rosangela jesus de oliveira 28 echoed reyes sentiments 
everybody is getting laid off and when the boss fires you all he 
ever says is collor collor collor 
ms oliveira arrived at the labor ministry at 6 am to register 
for unemployment benefits but found that 500 people were already 
waiting before her 
this president of ours is going to kill the poor with 
hunger she said 
economics minister cardoso has said the government will use some 
of the money in blocked bank accounts to help industries that were 
hard hit by the economic plan she said a special credit line of 
500 million has already been set up for the construction industry 
but almost all economists say that will not be enough to prevent 
a steep recession 
said economist edmar bacha a recession is inevitable its 
duration will depend on the governments future conduct of economic 
policy but i would not be surprised to see a 20 percent drop in 
industrial production over the next three months 
he said the harsh measures were necessary to curb inflation 
some people fear that a steep recession would worsen income 
inequalities in this country where the richest 1 percent holds 
wealth equal to that of the poorest 50 percent and most people live 
on less than 200 a month 
but many believe that collors plan will nevertheless remain 
popular even if there is a dramatic economic downturn 
if inflation stays low most brazilians will be happy the 
unemployed will make a lot of noise but theyll only account for a 
small percentage of the population even in a worstcase 
scenario said rep cesar maia an economic spokeman for the 
centerleft democratic labor party

comanche peak the 91 billion nuclear power 
plant troubled by a decade of delays can now begin moving toward 
commercial operations under a fullpower license from the nuclear 
regulatory commission 
the fivemember nrc in a unanimous vote monday granted the 
license despite a lastminute attempt by opponents who complained 
that evacuation procedures failed to account for a summer 
population of children attending church camps in the area of the 
plant and that permanent residents of the area about 80 miles 
southwest of dallas were not adequately informed of potential 
dangers 
erle nye chairman and chief executive office of tu electric 
said the plant could begin producing power for commercial use by 
summer 
the plant won an nrc license two months ago to load fuel and 
begin lowpower operations testing has been going on since under 
the lowpower license which had limited the 1150megawatt unit 1 
reactor to operating at 5 percent of capacity 
comanche peak would be the second and likely the last plant 
this year to receive a fullpower operating license from the nrc 
said nrc spokesman frank ingram the commission last month awarded 
the controversial seabrook nuclear power plant in new hampshire a

the bush administration acknowledges it is 
allowing south african iron and steel into the united states 
despite a 1986 economic sanction designed to force an end to 
apartheid the state department said monday 
however state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
monday that most of the controversial imports are ferroalloys 
strategic commodities never intended by congress to be banned under 
the law 
she said the administrations definition of steel was upheld in 
a federal court in 1987 and that certain prefabricated products 
that contain steel are not included in the definition of steel 
this administration will continue to enforce fully all 
provisions of the comprehensive antiapartheid act ms tutwiler 
said this is an old issue that has been thoroughly reviewed by 
the treasury department 
a treasury department official told the associated press on 
monday that ferroalloys were always outside the scope of the law 
and that the department had intended to screen out prefabricated 
products containing steel 
however the official said the appeals court for the court of 
international trade ruled against the department the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said such imports were very 
minor about 1 percent of the volume of ferroalloys our 
enforcement is very strict the official said there is no 
reason for alarm

from a south african jail feb 11 
he declared the day one of rededication to the continuation 
and intensification of the struggle for the emancipation of all the 
remaining political prisoners in south africa imploring the 
world to keep up the struggle to dismantle the system that denies 
the countrys black majority the vote 
the apartheid crime against humanity remains in place it 
continues to kill and maim it continues to oppress and exploit 
he said 
mandela spoke for nearly a half hour his words interrupted 
about 30 times by cheers and applause 
he urged that economic sanctions be kept in place and that south 
africas whiteled government not be rewarded for releasing 
political prisoners or lifting the ban on the anc the leading 
antiapartheid group 
the british media took his comments as veiled criticism of prime 
minister margaret thatcher who opposes sanctions 
mandela said the struggle to end apartheid and transform south 
african into a nonracial democracy can only be realized as a 
result of struggle including the struggle represented by the 
international sanctions campaign antiapartheid sentiment was 
wound up for more than four hours prior to mandelas appearance by 
an international lineup of rock and jazz musicians performing 
political pop 
the british reggae band aswad opened with mandelas back in 
town followed by patti labelles oh people the neville 
brothers my blood neil youngs keep on rockin in the free 
world jackson browne and johnny clegg harmonizing in one 
human one vote and numbers by grammywinner bonnie raitt 
natalie cole anita baker and a dozen others 
tracy chapman sang before mandelas appearance and once again 
afterward delivering a moving solo version of talkin bout a 
revolution 
the concert sold out in two days among those who paid 33 to 
attend were former us presidential candidate jesse jackson and 
neil kinnock leader of britains opposition labor party 
concert organizers said part of the proceeds would go to 
charities including oxfam and save the children fund they gave no 
estimate because the sale of television rights was still under way 
in an earlier news conference mandela said he came to britain 
to thank those had pressured south africa for his release 
about 90 minutes after his appearance at the concert mandela 
left london on a flight to addis ababa ethiopia he arrived sunday

after losing an election to a prous 
coalition the leftist sandinista front still seems far from 
collecting its consolation prize the quick dismantling of the 
contra rebels 
but the contras reluctance to demobilize which they insist 
stems from a distrust of the sandinistas but others call a grab for 
power might become their undoing 
the united national opposition or uno is poised to assume 
power on april 25 but could find itself starting its tenure with a 
fresh outbreak of a war that seemed to be petering out after nine 
years 
the fabric of stability careful woven together by electoral 
victor and vanquished seems on the brink of unraveling just when 
it seemed the processes of democratization and pacification were 
nearly complete 
the situation is grave delicate and difficult because the 
blood is still running and there are threats of new political 
explosions and a new escalation on the military field outgoing 
president daniel ortega said monday as he met with evangelical 
leaders 
we are facing a real risk that we may get to april 25 and the 
peaceful transition of power that we all have sought will not take 
place the man who lost februarys general elections said later 
uno leaders have placed great emphasis on this being the first 
time in national history that power is transferred to an opposition 
government peacefully 
however as soon as uno won the elections most of the contras 
slipped across the border into nicaragua leaving behind in 
honduras only the wounded the crippled and a few old guns 
the move made more symbolic than effective a unocontra accord 
of march 23 under which contra forces in honduras are to demobilize 
this week 
neither that accord nor another unocontra pact reached april 9 
made any mention of what had been a top demand of the usbacked 
contras that the sandinista peoples army disarm and that the 
officer corps be dismissed 
that is what contra chief of staff israel galeano known as 
commander franklin is now again demanding as a condition for his 
men to give up their weapons and return to civilian life under the 
government of uno presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro 
mrs chamorro defeated the sandinistas in the elections but i 
think she will not be able to impose her authority on the 
sandinistas and if she doesnt there wont be democracy in 
nicaragua galeano said in an april 11 interview with the 
associated press in tegucigalpa honduras 
galeano is now back in nicaragua and he has vowed to keep 
fighting until his demand is met 
for the sandinistas whose military commanders can remain in 
place under a march 27 accord with uno the return of an estimated 
9000 contras only means the prospect of more war 
the fundamental problem here is that the contras cant demand 
to share in the power said a wellplaced sandinista military 
source speaking on condition of anonymity they have to abide by 
the agreements they must demobilize 
this week the prosandinista press in managua ran frontpage 
headlines predicting war and a muscleflexing offensive by the 
contras to show theyre still a force to be reckoned with 
one diplomat dismissing the honduran demobilization set to 
begin wednesday as a farce seemed to agree 
this is the key week after so many months of talks and the 
situation this week is very very dangerous the diplomat said 
everything could go down the drain 
the uno must search hard and fast for a compromise that will 
allow the sandinistas to feel safe from the contras while 
acknowledging what the rebels feel they have contributed to unos 
electoral victory 
failing that the uno government might find itself in the grips 
of a strange irony asking its sandinista foes for help in stamping 
out its contra allies

the legal dance through the justice system is 
over for students in this ozarks hamlet who want to cut the rug at 
their school but cant because of a 100yearold ban on 
highsteppin 
the us supreme court decision monday left intact the school 
boards nodancing rule 
opponents of the ban plan no appeal the best they can hope for 
is to elect school board members who are prodancing said howard 
fox one of 21 students and parents who had sued four years ago in 
an attempt to overturn the rule 
the current board members are not going to be there forever 
fox said ultimately we will dance on their graves 
figuratively 
most residents of the village of 900 were reluctant to discuss 
the ruling many including students at purdy high school just 
shook their heads and walked away others like lois dawn and foxs 
wife joan had plenty to say 
its these new people who have moved in mrs dawn said of 
several families who sued to overturn the ban this is a baptist 
town who are these people to come in and inflict their views 
on everyone else 
mrs fox shook her head and sighed 
weve lived in this town for 12 years and were still 
considered outsiders mostly because were catholic she said 
its an extreme victory for liars cheats and hypocrites i think 
the judicial system in this country has gone to pot 
mrs dawn graduated from 100yearold purdy high in 1957 when 
the only kind of dancing allowed was in gym class 
in 1986 the students and parents sued a federal judge agreed 
with them that the ban was motivated by fundamentalist ministers 
fervently opposed to dancing and was thus a violation of separation 
of church and state 
the school board appealed saying the ban had nothing to do with 
religion meanwhile students kicked up their heels at the first 
dance at purdy high school in 1988 
two more dances followed at the 230student school but the 
future of school dances remains in question 
without comment the supreme court let stand the 54 federal 
appeals court ruling last fall that upheld the boards right to ban 
dances 
the board met in regular session monday night but 
superintendent sheldon buxton said a decision on whether to modify 
or abandon the rule wont come until next months meeting he would 
not speculate on what the board would do 
this is not the time or place for the board to gloat said 
board president glenn garrett it is time for the board 
administration faculty students and the purdy citizens to set 
about healing the divisions caused by this litigation 
fox said prodancers triumphed whether the ban remains 
there have been dances attended by orderly wellbehaved 
students who had a wonderful time no sex drugs and alcohol like 
some of the ministers preached taverns did not sprout on every 
street corner he said our point has been proven

masayoshi shimoyama a senior trader with nikko securities co 
said the index fell further toward the end of the afternoon session 
as a waitandsee mood grew in the market prior to a us trade 
figure announcement on wednesday 
in early trading the index rose because the yens stability 
below the 160yen level reasured participants traders said 
a dealer with nomura securities co said however there is 
little positive reason to continue buying 
participants were buying mainly in an attempt to prevent the 
index from falling below 28000 points a level seen as a 
psychological barrier he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the stock market is still very sensitive and nervous although 
we believe it has bottomed out the dealer said 
in currency dealings the dollaryen rate was moving steadily in 
mixed trading dealers said 
some investors were inclined to buy the dollar amid 
uncertainties over developments in lithuania while other investors 
sold the us money for profittaking said masato hayashi a 
dealer with the bank of tokyo 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev on friday threatened to 
impose economic sanctions on lithuania if the rebel baltic republic 
refuses to rescind controversial legislation passed since its 
declaration of independence last month 
other dealers said that enough long or overbought dollar 
positions have been built up as market players expect an

homeowners gardens and yards in the gold 
rush town of skagway will be vacuumed this month in a hightech 
spring cleaning aimed at removing lead from the soil 
the work which starts this week is the final step in one of 
alaskas most expensive pollution cleanups 
extremely high levels of lead were discovered in 1988 in the 
soil in skagway a shipping port for lead and zinc ore for decades 
but fears that the 700 residents were threatened by lead poisoning 
were eased by the results of blood tests conducted by the state 
state health officials concluded the lead posed no significant 
threat blood lead levels in virtually all the residents tested 
were below average officials explained that skagways lead is in a 
raw form which is not as easily absorbed into the body as 
processed lead 
still the state department of environmental conservation 
ordered lead levels in the soil reduced to within federal 
standards the first phase of the cleanup in industrial areas was 
halted for winter in december but resumed last week 
the residential cleanup begins this week and the entire 
operation may be completed by may said paul taylor vice president 
of alaska operations for white pass transportation inc which owns 
the skagway ore terminal 
we want to get this whole lead thing wrapped up before tourist 
season taylor said sunday 
despite early problems with the cleanup including several 
violations of cleanup procedures and disagreements among the four 
companies involved the work has proceeded on time said dick 
stokes dec regional supervisor in juneau 
the companies estimate theyve spent as much as 6 million on 
the cleanup and the state has spent about 175000 stokes said 
its probably been the largest nonoil cleanup in the state 
stokes said i certainly think its been the most complex being 
right in the middle of a town 
preliminary results of followup soil tests in what were once 
the most contaminated areas show lead levels below the limit of 
1000 parts per million stokes said before the cleanup 
concentrations were as high as 133000 ppm 
much of the cleanup has employed large vacuum trucks that can 
suck up soil several inches deep the vacuum separates the fine 
leadfilled soil from the coarse soil the ore then is filtered 
through screens at the terminal and washed into holding ponds 
taylor said 
the lead that settles to the bottom will be recovered and the 
water filtered 
in the end well have a few thousand gallons of clean water 
and a truckload of lead taylor said 
the residential cleanup unlike the industrial effort is 
optional property owners are being offered the services of the 
vacuumtruck crews to get the lead out of their yards 
we arent planning to rip up any sidewalks or even tear up 
established lawns stokes said well try to target loose soils 
in places where tracking would be the most significant 
there hasnt been a whole lot of interest i think well end 
up with one or two dozen lots where well do some work 
before the blood test results were announced last fall dec 
officials had considered ordering an indoor cleanup of homes where 
vacuum cleaner samples had shown high concentrations of lead that 
idea was rejected in light of the small health risk 
it would be too expensive and too disruptive it wasnt 
justified stokes said 
instead the state has told residents to reduce their exposure to 
the ore by increased handwashing frequent damp mopping and 
dusting and avoiding tracking soil into their homes 
concern over the lead appears to have subsided in skagway as it 
prepares for summer which every year brings thousands of tourists 
on cruise ships and day excursions from juneau 92 miles to the 
south 
a group formed to monitor the cleanup get the lead out 
disbanded last week and when the state held a public hearing on 
the spring cleanup plans wednesday only about 20 people showed 
lynne smith a mother who has lived on and off in skagway for 13 
years said the groups members were not fully satisfied with the 
cleanup 
but weve really gone through a lot in the last year she 
said so we just have to decide what we will do in our own 
individual lives as far as protecting our children

even the easter holidays didnt stop 
thousands of poles from streaming into west berlin some to shop 
others to sell goods in a muddy littered field known as the 
polish market 
the influx of poles to west berlin one of the few western 
european destinations they can visit without visas has increased 
dramatically since the polish zloty became convertible in january 
more than a million poles have visited since west berlin 
officials say 
many head for the polish market a ragtag bazaar near central 
potsdamer platz where poles sell whatever they can bring from home 
they cart to west berln everything from caviar smuggled out of 
the soviet union to farm fresh eggs and bacon untaxed cigarettes 
and polish vodka 
for poles trying to weather their countrys radical 
transformation from a centrally planned to a free market economy 
the bazaar can be a crucial source of income 
who knows how long ill have a job im sure the company will 
go bust by june said krzysztof goral a bus driver from poznan 
as he tried to sell a pair of mounted deer antlers for 15 marks 
930 
weve got to try to earn while we can said his brother 
marek an electrician who watched over a pile of chocolates and 
woodenhandled screwdrivers the brothers also had for sale 
the goral brothers are regulars at the polish market 
every friday they take an evening train on the 205mile trip to 
east berlin upon arrival they stay up all night in order to avoid 
a hotel bill then cross into west berlin to stake out a spot at 
the market early in the morning 
many other polish visitors sleep in their cars tour buses or 
try to camp in the zoo train station 
those habits along with the wideopen trading at the market 
appal many berliners who would like the city government to do 
something to stop the flow 
poles call it business germans call it smuggling and officials 
have recorded more than 26000 customs violations so far this year 
officials say the amount of confiscated goods mostly from 
poles is no longer conceivable said the berlin morgenpost 
newspaper more than 15 million cigarettes have been confiscated 
at the market since january the newspaper reported 
despite the discomforts of travel and the threat of fines and 
confiscation many poles find the market essential 
things are hard in poland ive got two kids and no job ive 
got to make a living said stanislaw neuman of wroclaw 
neuman lost his job last month as a bus driver as a part of the 
economic shock therapy that ended state subsidies and has left 
more than 200000 people unemployed since taking effect jan 1 
his blanket covered with polish shaving creme plastic combs 
used clothes and hand tools neuman hoped to earn a few marks that 
can be exchanged for zlotys to be spent at home 
although neuman was selling items for low prices his markups 
would make many merchants envious among his goods was a comb that 
he had bought for 1000 zlotys about 10 cents he later sold it 
for the equivalent of 3000 zlotys 
he also earned 13 marks 775 nearly onesixth of what he 
earned each month as a bus driver for a used pair of high heels 
sold to a turkish customer 
other poles come to buy goods they then sell for a profit back 
home at one of the thousands of open markets springing up across 
poland but facing customs restrictions they may not tell you as 
much 
we dont have these kind of things in poland confided 
henryk stachowicz a coal miner from zabrze pointing proudly to 
two new electronic keyboards he had just purchased 
he said he could get 850000 zlotys 89 in poland for each 
keyboard which he purchased for the equivalent of 660000 zlotys 
69 apiece 
unshaven and dressed in wrinkled clothes stachowicz and the 
other 36 passengers who paid 140000 zlotys 1470 for a 
roundtrip bus ticket slept in their tour bus in a west berlin 
parking lot rather than pay for a hotel 
the coal miner denied he planned to resell the keyboards he 
also insisted he would never do business at the polish market 
stand there and sell stuff thats not for me i have a job 
there is just nothing to buy in poland he said

despite a merchants strike that turned 
chinatown into a virtual ghost town city supervisors have decided 
to raze and rebuild an earthquakedamaged freeway rather than take 
the quicker step of repairing it 
the board of supervisors voted 65 monday to replace the 
twomile elevated embarcadero freeway which led tourists into 
chinatown north beach and fishermans wharf before the october 
quake cracked its concrete towers 
the vote was seen as a victory for mayor art agnos who wants to 
build a sunken roadway that would cost 120 million and take at 
least four years 
chinatown merchants had pressed instead for repairs which state 
officials said would cost an estimated 32 million and take just 
six months 
most of chinatowns 1200 shops restaurants and professional 
offices had shut down monday afternoon to protest plans to demolish 
the embarcadero the city hall hearing drew about 1000 chinatown 
residents 
this is the first time in 205 years the chinese community has 
shut down their businesses to protest said protest organizer 
rose pak of the chinese chamber of commerce 
the vote brought boos from people in the audience including 
many who came to city hall in chartered buses and wore green 
tshirts that read we love the embarcadero freeway 
merchants have complained their businesses have suffered since 
the freeway was closed by the 71magnitude earthquake that shook 
northern california on oct 17 killing 68 people deputy mayor 
james ho estimated business is down by 8 percent pak put the drop 
closer to 30 percent for touristdependent businesses and 20 
percent for those relying on local residents 
the freeway built in the 1950s was controversial from the 
start with environmentalists contending it was unsightly and split 
the waterfront from san franciscos downtown 
in opposing demolition supervisor richard hongisto said 
neighborhood businesses would suffer during the time it will take 
to build a new roadway 
instead of our favorite italian or chinese restaurant when 
the freeway finally gets built youll find a mcdonalds 
hongisto said 
agnos vowed to develop a system of streets to route traffic 
efficiently he said after the vote that the demolition presented 
the opportunity of a lifetime 
supervisor jim gonzalez said the city had a chance to build 
one of the most beautiful waterfronts in the history of the united 
states 
the board of supervisors vote to endorse the concept of a 
subsurface or surface freeway will make a final review of the 
issue by aug 1

novelist mario vargas llosa has decided not to 
withdraw from the presidential runoff against alfredo fujimori the 
upstart independent who is suddenly favored to win 
saying he is constitutionally required to take part in the 
second round vargas llosa declared monday that he will campaign 
fighting for the reforms that our country needs the runoff 
will probably take place in early june 
the celebrated writer who advocates harsh austerity measures to 
revive the countrys crippled economy won the most votes in the 
first round of voting april 8 but was far from the majority needed 
for election 
after his disappointing firstround showing vargas llosa 
considered pulling out of the race but he was reported to have 
been urged to stay in the race by roman catholic officials and 
senior figures in the military 
the government is battling a bloody 10yearold insurgency by 
maoistinspired shining path rebels and the military apparently 
fears fujimori would not be as forceful a leader as vargas llosa 
fujimori an agronomist who says vargas llosas economic plan 
would only bring recession is expected to pick up the votes that 
had been cast for leftist candidates in the first round it is 
believed that vargas llosas association with the wealthy cost him 
much support 
the writer entered the political fray two years ago after 
leading rallies against president alan garcias attempts to 
nationalize the countrys banks 
fujimori the descendent of japanese immigrants and a political 
unknown when he started the race has been criticized by vargas 
llosas centerright democratic front coalition for being vague on 
his plans for peru 
finally he is detailing some concrete proposals in an 
interview published monday fujimori rejected vargas llosas call 
to privatize most of perus huge companies which many peruvians 
fear would lead to massive layoffs 
the candidate also sharply criticized us drug policy in peru 
saying washingtonbacked attempts have failed to eradicate coca 
plants the raw material of cocaine 
the 51yearold former rector of perus respected national 
university of agriculture recommended building railroads and 
highways into perus main cocaproducing region so local farmers 
can more easily get legal produce to markets along the coast 
coca growers must be oriented towards other types of cash 
crops rice for example but for this highways must be built 
fujimori said in the interview in the lima daily newspaper pagina 
libre 
fujimori was set to announce his official platform at a monday 
night press conference but he canceled at the last minute due to 
what his wife described as food poisoning 
vargas llosas announcement he would stay in the race came an 
hour later in a short communique released after meetings with 
campaign strategists and leaders of his party 
in the first round vargas llosa won just 32 percent of the vote 
after topping 50 percent in february opinion polls fujimori won 30 
percent 
the novelists coalition also fell well short of capturing a 
majority in congress 
vargas llosa went into seclusion with his family last week to 
mull over the decision on whether to continue the race aides said 
he was discouraged by the likelihood he would lose the runoff 
equally discouraging if he won was the prospect of trying to 
govern without a congressional majority 
without legislative support vargas llosa would face great 
problems imposing the harsh austerity measures he advocates 
in the pagina libre interview fujimori said we are not in 
agreement with the shock program proposed by vargas llosa which 
would bring a deeper recession and we are against a recession 
fujimori was also quoted as saying he would welcome foreign 
funds and advice in the fight against the shining path

the tokyo stock exchanges chief index lost morning 
gains to inch lower today while the dollar strengthened against 
the japanese yen on expectations of a decline in the us trade 
deficit 
the 225share nikkei stock average lost 158 points or 0006 
percent ending the day at 2846160 the index which on monday 
fell 75074 points started lower regained 34965 points and fell 
back in the afternoon session 
some of the buying in the morning was carried out to prevent the 
index from falling below 28000 points which is seen as a 
psychological barrier said a dealer with nomura securities co 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the stock market is still very sensitive and nervous although 
we believe it has bottomed out the dealer said 
traders attributed the afternoon losses to intermittent 
indexlinked selling including arbitrage by securities firms 
both japanese and foreign securities firms conducted arbitrage 
selling from time to time in small amounts throughout the afternoon 
session said masayoshi shimoyama a senior trader with nikko 
securities co 
stock traders and analysts have blamed arbitrage sellings for 
the continuing plunge of the tokyo stock market since the beginning 
of this year largescale arbitrage sales in thin trading have a 
strong impact on the market 
the tokyo stock exchange has asked member firms to make a weekly 
report on the number of shares and the amount of money traded in 
arbitrage dealings to eliminate uncertainties among investors 
stock market officials said tuesday 
shimoyama said participants gradually withdrew to the sidelines 
toward the end of the day ahead of the announcement of us trade 
figures for february slated for wednesday 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 15983 yen up 041 
yen from mondays close of 15942 yen the currency opened at 
15971 yen and traded between 15960 yen and 15995 yen 
the dollar was pushed up during the afternoon session by 
investors expecting improvements in the us trade balance dealers 
said 
the us trade deficit is expected to be around 81 billion 
from 93 billion in january some even predict the deficit will be 
45 billion said toru kanai foreign exchange analyst with new 
japan securities co 
however dollar selling for profittaking prevented the us 
currency from climbing over the 160yen level kanai said 
uncertainties over developments in lithuania also prompted 
dollar buying because the dollar is believed to be the safest 
investment in times of emergency said masato hayashi a dealer 
with the bank of tokyo 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev on friday threatened to 
impose economic sanctions on lithuania if the rebel baltic republic 
refuses to rescind legislation passed since its declaration of 
independence last month 
in the bond market the price of the benchmark no 119 japanese 
government bonds was changing hands at 8590 points at 4 pm up 
from mondays close at 8574 the 119s yield fell to 7385 percent

a leading newspaper says three hostages released in 
lebanon last week were seized in 1986 by libyas navy not the 
following year by abunidals palestinian terrorist group as had 
been claimed 
mondays frontpage article in le monde and other similar 
reports could increase pressure on france to reveal more details 
about the case 
french officials effusively thanked libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi after the release of jacqueline valente of france her 
belgian companion fernand houtekins and the child born to them in 
captivity 
critics accused france of cutting a deal for their freedom 
the fatahrevolutionary council abu nidals libyanbacked 
group claimed in november 1987 that it had seized a yacht carrying 
suspected proisraeli spies in the eastern mediterranean 
aboard were ms valente two of her daughters who were freed in 
1988 houtekins and four members of his family the four members of 
houtekins family are still being held while abu nidal demands the 
release of a palestinian sentenced to life in prison in belgium for 
a terrorist attack 
le monde said in mondays article that it appeared the boat 
actually was captured by the libyan navy in 1986 in waters between 
malta and libyas gulf of sidra it said gadhafi later asked abu 
nidals group to claim responsibility 
le monde gave no specific sources for its report 
a 1986 abduction date would explain the mystery surrounding 
sophieliberte the daughter of houtekins and valente reporters 
who saw the girl after her release generally agreed she looked and 
acted like a 4yearold 
le monde said its version of the capture would also explain a 
few comments by the freed hostages who have declined to answer 
questions about their abduction and captivity 
an aide to abu nidal claimed the hostages were held in lebanon 
throughout their captivity and they were released april 10 in 
lebanon but le monde noted that houtekins walking to freedom at 
the french embassy in beirut said he was tired by the voyage 
suggesting he had made a long journey 
also houtekins said they had been kept for a long period in a 
large villa which le monde said was unthinkable in the hell 
of lebanon 
the week before the hostages were released gadhafi publicly 
appealed for them to be set free immediately after their release 
gadhafi was thanked by president francois mitterrand and praised as 
a humanitarian by foreign minister roland dumas 
le monde said there were no firm rules for governments in 
dealing with hostage cases but asked at what point does a state 
have the right to enter into this hellish game if it must support 
the most shameful of lies for the enormous benefit of criminals 
the newspaper le figaro reported last week the possibility that 
the freed hostages were seized by libya earlier than previously 
reported 
the hostages held by abu nidals group are considered separate 
from the 18 westerners held in lebanon most of them are believed 
to be held by proiranian shiite moslem groups 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985

need the whole entire united states army on hand to keep everybody 
out 
hospital spokeswoman myrna manners said garbo had been a kidney 
dialysis patient but at the familys request she released no other 
information the medical examiners office told the post that

quit hollywood spending the rest of her life in shuttered and 
fenced residences in france switzerland and manhattan where she 
lived in an east side highrise 
her frugal ways and good financial advice built the stars 
holdings into a fortune according to the post which reported she 
owned several buildings in beverly hills an extensive art 
collection and her east side coop 
her only relative is her niece grae reisfeld of passaic nj 
who also fiercely guards her privacy the post said 
the swedish beautys sculpted face and husky voice made her an 
international star and one of the worlds most famous recluses 
living by her most famous line i vant to be alone 
however she was not a shutin but took long solitary walks 
around town in a slouch hat and dark glasses 
shed get up in the morning and go out walking she loved to 
window shop the surprising thing is that she wasnt recognized 
more frequently playwright garson kanin told the daily news 
he remembers her telling him people in new york really dont 
bother you at all when i go home to sweden everybody stares and 
asks for autographs in new york its easy to be anonymous

in 1923 she made 12 silent films before uttering her first words 
in the 1930 movie anna christie gimme a visky ginger ale on 
the side and dont be stingy baby 
she was always a living unreachable myth the founder of a 
religious order called cinema said italian film director

an animalrights activist pleaded no 
contest to charges she attempted to kill the head of a surgical 
supply company with a bomb under the plea bargain she will 
receive one year in prison 
fran trutt 33 pleaded no contest monday to attempted murder 
possession of explosives and bomb manufacturing 
trutt who earlier turned down a plea agreement that did not 
permit her visits with her four dogs could have received 20 years 
in prison on the attempted murder charge alone 
she was arrested in 1988 after a remotecontrolled pipe bomb was 
found near the parking space of us surgical corp chairman leon 
hirsch in norwalk 
defense attorney john williams said she opted for the plea 
bargain because the prosecution planned to present tape recorded 
conversations in which trutt discussed her sex life and the murder 
attempt 
the sex tapes i think thats what did it it was just 
disgusting he said the tapes were of telephone conversations 
between trutt and a woman hired by us surgical to befriend trutt 
and spy on her the lawyer said 
us surgical has been criticized by animalrights activists for 
its use of anesthetized dogs to train physicians in the use of 
surgical staples instead of stitches the dogs are then destroyed 
in entering her plea trutt maintained her innocence instead 
she accused hirsch of murdering dogs as superior court judge 
joette katz reviewed the charges trutt said the one who was 
guilty of that is hirsch 
animalrights activists and trutt claimed she was set up by the 
company to discredit their movement which had long criticized us 
surgical 
in a statement us surgical said the case vindicated the 
company 
activists can protest that they can disagree and they can 
picket peacefully but the american system of justice will pursue 
vigorously those who attempt to force their views on others through 
violence it said

the us supreme court has cleared the way 
for the execution of a nearly retarded man for the 1977 murder of a 
state trooper 
lifting a stay of execution it granted four months ago the high 
court on monday voted 72 to deny the appeals by dalton prejean 
30 who has been on death row since 1978 longer than any other 
inmate in louisiana 
death penalty opponents have made prejeans case a cause 
celebre saying he should be spared because he was just 17 when he 
shot trooper donald cleveland and because he has an iq of 76 and 
the mental capability of a 13yearold 
no new execution date was set for prejean who is at the 
louisiana state penitentiary and was less than eight hours away 
from the electric chair in november when the high court granted the 
stay and agreed to consider the case 
the pardon board voted 32 that month to recommend gov buddy 
roemer reduce prejeans sentence to life in prison based on 
testimony that he had been abused as a child and may have brain 
damage roemer rejected the recommendation 
prejean shot cleveland twice in the face with a 38caliber 
pistol after a routine traffic stop six months earlier prejean 
had been released from a reform school where had served time for 
killing a cab driver at age 14 
last june the us supreme court ruled that the constitution 
does not forbit executing murderers who are retarded or were 
teenagers at the time of the crime 
prejeans appeal focused largely on whether the judges 
instructions to the jury had prevented full consideration of 
prejeans mental deficiencies 
in refusing to grant clemency last year roemer cited the brutal 
nature of clevelands death noted that cleveland was a uniformed 
trooper on duty at the time and said the sentence met all judicial 
standards for the death penalty 
voting in prejeans favor monday were justices william j 
brennan and thurgood marshall who oppose capital punishment under 
all circumstances

president saddam hussein said in the event 
of an israeli nuclear attack he has instructed his commanders to 
hit israel with chemical weapons without waiting for orders 
government media reported today 
several newspapers and the iraqi news agency said saddam made 
the disclosure last week during talks with a group of six visiting 
us senators led by sen robert dole rkan 
i ordered the commanders of air and rocket bases if they ever 
hear that israel hits any base or place in iraq with an atomic 
bomb you have to hit israel because israel could hit us while we 
the leadership are holding a meeting in baghdad saddam was 
quoted as saying 
so you have an advance order to hit back even in the event 
that you do not have an order from a top commander if israel bombs 
any base or any iraqi city the iraqi media quoted him as saying 
israeli jets using conventional bombs destroyed an unfinished 
iraqi nuclear reactor near baghdad in 1981 israel claimed the 
facility was being used to develop atomic weapons but iraq denied 
it 
saddam had earlier announced that in the event of an israeli 
attack on iraqi installations his nation would retaliate with 
advanced binary chemical weapons 
that announcement came after the arrests in london of several 
people accused of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers to iraq 
later british customs agents impounded iraqbound steel tubing in 
northern england saying it could be part of a huge gun 
after meeting with saddam dole did not give many details of 
their talks but did say saddam was seriously worried israel would 
launch a preemptive strike similar to the one in 1981

an american scientist cited as the father of 
artificial intelligence and three earthquake researchers 
including a us professor today received the two 1990 japan 
prizes each worth 315000 
professor marvin minsky of the massachusetts institute of 
technology who has been working on how to make computers learn 
more by themselves received his prize in the field of technology 
of integration 
the other prize for earth science was shared by american 
professor william jason morgan of princeton university professor 
dan peter mckenzie of britains cambridge university and xavier le 
pichon director of the ecole normale superieure in france 
the three were cited for their work on the theory that the 
earths crust is made up of rigid tectonic plates that grind 
against each other causing earthquakes volcanic eruptions and the 
formation of ridges and mountains 
the prizes were awarded at ceremonies attended by emperor 
akihito and empress michiko and prime minister toshiki kaifu 
the nonprofit science and technology foundation of japan under 
the direction of the prime ministers office began awarding the 
prizes in 1985 to promote applied scientific research of direct 
benefit to mankind 
it has expressed hope that the japan prize will become as widely 
recognized as the nobel prize 
the foundation said it received 662 recommendations for this 
years prizes 
the 1991 prizes will be awarded for applied mathematics and 
imaging techniques in medicine it added 
on monday morgan told a news conference that despite progress 
in forecasting the location and size of earthquakes predicting the 
exact time is still pretty much in the future 
minsky told reporters that in the next few years a computer 
will be able to watch your eyes and your face and will be able to 
tell what interests you 
it might for example enlarge whatever the operator is studying 
on the screen he said 
minsky said some computers now can recognize spoken words 
without understanding their meaning 
in another generation maybe 10 years maybe 50 the computer 
will have more understanding like a child and know what words 
really mean and then it will be more like talking to another 
person he said 
once that happens its impossible to make predictions he 
added

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by a 
40yearold man convicted of killing four people and upheld a high 
court death sentence against him 
norio nagayama was first convicted and sentenced to death by the 
tokyo district court in 1979 for slaying four people during four 
1968 robberies he used a handgun stolen from a us military base 
in tokyo 
the case has been highly publicized because nagayama who was 19 
at the time of the crimes has written at least four awardwinning 
autobiographical novels since his imprisonment in 1969 
in 1981 the tokyo high court commuted his death sentence to 
life imprisonment 
but after an appeal by prosecutors the supreme court in 1983 
ordered a retrial of the case and four years later the high court 
reaffirmed his death sentence 
in their appeal to the supreme court defense lawyers argued the 
death penalty was unconstitutional because it violated article 36 
of the japanese constitution which forbids cruel punishment they 
also argued nagayama was young and mentally unstable when he 
committed the crimes 
four judges however unanimously supported the high courts 
decision in favor of the death penalty 
in two 1968 robbery attempts nagayama tried to break into 
hotels and in both cases killed security guards before fleeing in 
two further cases he killed taxi drivers after robbing them 
japanese authorities are extremely secretive about executions 
which occur by hanging and do not disclose the time of death 
neither the number of people on death row nor the date of the 
latest execution are available 
by law an execution must be carried out within six months after 
a death sentence is finalized but legal experts say executions are 
frequently delayed 
the death sentence was handed down most recently early last year 
by the nagoya district court in the conviction of a 20yearold man 
for killing a young couple in 1988 the case has been appealed to 
the high court

mayor marion barry again is accepting 
donations to the reelection campaign he had put on hold while 
receiving treatment for substance abuse his top political aide 
says 
the aide anita bonds described barry as a potential 
candidate for reelection but a wjlatv television reporter who 
met with him monday said the mayor told me he now feels good 
enough about his recovery from alcohol and chemical addictions to 
seek a fourth term 
the station quoted unidentified sources as saying barry is 
convinced the city and its voters will give him a second chance 
ms bonds told the washington post a formal decision on whether 
barry will launch a reelection campaign before his trial could 
come late this week or next week 
she said barry planned to attend a forum being hosted next week 
by the american federation of government employees a powerful 
labor union in the district whose endorsement is coveted by city 
candidates 
barry returned to the district a month ago after several weeks 
of treatment for alcohol and chemical dependencies he entered 
treatment after being arrested in a sting operation in which 
federal authorities allegedly videotaped the mayor smoking crack 
cocaine in a hotel 
barry was indicted on felony charges of lying to a grand jury 
about alleged past drug use and on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine 
possession his trial is scheduled for june 4 
barry has been acting like a candidate since his return meeting 
with neighborhood and civic groups in campaignstyle events 
but until now he has shied away from formal mayoral campaign 
forums at which most of the candidates have criticized the barry 
administration

japan need not abandon its farmers for the sake of 
opening up world trade but it should end protection of specific 
crops a us official said today 
proposals made by washington at trade talks on agricultural 
products would permit nations to help their farmers said us 
undersecretary of agriculture richard t crowder 
were not asking countries to give up agricultural support 
programs what were asking is the support of agriculture in ways 
that do not distort or minimally distort trade patterns 
crowder told reporters 
what should be done is to support the income of farmers 
but not support production of a specific crop he said 
crowder said japan was not alone in its fears of what would 
happen to farmers in the event of trade liberalization nordic 
nations and switzerland had voiced similar concerns he said 
but he said food security depends not on artificial 
selfsufficiency but on an open marketoriented trading 
environment food security cannot legitimately be used as a 
shield against true trade liberalization 
japan is seeking exemptions to maintain its virtual ban on 
imported rice arguing the stiff barriers guarantee japans food 
supply last week japan reiterated its opposition to rice imports 
in an annual paper on agriculture endorsed by the cabinet 
the united states has proposed a phaseout of agricultural trade 
subsidies and barriers at the uruguay round of talks sponsored by 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade the talks run through 
december 
crowder in tokyo for consultations with japanese officials 
said the united states was prepared to address japans concerns 
american proposals do not call for quick approach to 
liberalization but rather a 10year transition period to ease the 
shock of imports he said 
but for liberalization to succeed all forms of agricultural 
supports export subsidies import access internal controls and 
health regulations must be put on the table at once for 
negotiation he said 
none of us are without sin he said acknowledging us farm 
supports would also have to be eliminated 
crowder said the us proposal was met with a cold reception 
especially from european community nations 
but he said japan should support trade liberalization across the 
board 
given japans prominent place in international trade we think 
japan needs to take a strong leadership role in the gatt 
negotiations japan will benefit significantly from supporting 
major trade reform crowder said 
the genevabased gatt sets rules for international trade

an envelope addressed to tax thieves exploded 
outside a suburban post office injuring a postal worker and 
shutting the office for several hours before the tax deadline 
the blast occurred at 830 pm monday in a mail hamper placed 
outside the royal oak post office to collect tax returns from 
filers rushing to meet the midnight deadline 
from the writing on the envelope there was an indication it 
was some kind of tax protest us postal inspector fred van de 
putte said 
there were no arrests postal officials said this morning 
the envelope addressed to the tax thieves contained a 
roman candle and a tea bag van de putte said 
the tea bag apparently referred to the boston tea party of 1773 
the tax protest that helped spark the american revolution the 
envelope also contained an unidentified red fluid and a fuse fire 
capt ron gammon said 
tom berlucchi 29 a maintenance employee for 10 years spotted 
the envelope smoking in a bin of lastminute tax returns 
berlucchi smelled something burning van de putte said he 
pushed aside the other mail and saw a brown padded envelope 
berlucchi was trying to toss the parcel into a nearby puddle 
when it exploded 
berlucchi was treated for burns on his hands and face and 
released william beaumont hospital spokeswoman valerie mahaczek 
said 
we dont know exactly what the explosive device was gammon 
said i guess the fluid was supposed to be blood it flew all 
over the place 
gammon said the department initially was told the explosion was 
inside the post office the distribution center for oakland county 
when we got there there were about 20 or 30 tax protesters 
but they disappeared fast he said there was no information 
linking the protesters to the blast 
patti hornick who was dropping off her tax return said i 
thought it was a fireworks display or something it looked like a 
huge fireworks explosion we just dropped our taxes in the bin and 
we saw them working on the injured man 
the blast did little or no structural damage to the post office 
royal oak police lt ray taylor said 
agents of the fbi federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms and state police bomb squad also responded to the 
explosion but the investigation was turned over to the postal 
service because it involved mail

a judge today ruled that a movie poster showing a 
sexually aroused young angel should be allowed in subway stations 
despite objections by the advertising company that sells the ad 
space 
judge marieclaude domb said the poster denounced by some 
religious groups as obscene might shock some subway riders 
but it could just as easily raise a smile she said 
metrobus which has a monopoly over advertising in the paris 
metro had argued that it was entitled to reject the poster 
advertising a new movie called its freezing in hell by 
director jeanpierre mocky 
the poster shows a painting of two chubby smiling young angels 
with black wings the female wearing black silk stockings and the 
male in a state of sexual arousal 
in the context of contemporary morality the judge said it was 
unlikely the poster would seriously offend the modesty of many 
people 
mocky initiated the court action to force metrobus to display 
about 260 copies of the posters from wednesday through may 2 for a 
payment of 75000

the soviet trade union federation which has come 
under criticism for kowtowing to the government instead of 
defending workers interests replaced its chairman today the 
official news agency tass said 
stepan shalayev 61 who had been chairman of the all union 
central council of trade unions for eight years asked to retire 
and was replaced by deputy chairman gennady yanaev tass said 
the change comes at a time when labor disputes continue to 
simmer in the soviet union hundreds of thousands of coal miners 
walked out across the country last summer and strikes are 
threatened in the oilrich western siberian region of tyumen 
the trade union council for decades acted mainly as a 
distributor of vacation trips medical care and other benefits 
rather than as an advocate for better conditions for workers it 
also conveyed government and communist party directives to workers 
last year however criticism mounted against the labor 
federation particularly during the coal strikes when miners 
complained that if the unions had taken better care of them they 
wouldnt have felt forced to strike 
the council has since made visible efforts to improve its image 
a plenum last fall pledged to conduct effective social policies 
and urged a price freeze on basic commodities it also pushed for 
an end to shortages of dairy products soap medicine and notebooks 
todays plenary meeting defined the trade unions role as 
working toward helping the population adjust to a market economy 
and simultaneously helping the poorer strata of society 
president mikhail s gorbachev has said he is planning soon to 
introduce radical economic reforms that are expected to include 
price increases and heighten unemployment 
the council proposed a system that would compensate poor people 
especially those on fixed incomes for price hikes 
yanaev 52 graduated from an agricultural institute and law 
school and headed the soviet committee of youth organizations for 
12 years tass reported 
he has won domestic popularity for his parliamentary crusade 
for workers social and economic rights and interests the news

members on a commercial fishing boat that sank after it left 
darien ga last wednesday en route to a fishing area off edisto 
beach sc 
coast guard officials do not know exactly when the boat sank or 
how long the man had floated in the box which may have been used 
as an engine cover on the boat farrell said

was up and out of the water in the box farrell said neesmith 
who was described by a doctor as confused had been able to 
tell searchers little about what happened 
the coast guard sent two boats and two helicopters to search for 
the three other crew members but no sign of them had been found by 
early today farrell said

by telephone at her darien home said the men were commercial 
fishermen who went fishing for snappers for a living she said

nasa engineers fired the galileo 
spacecrafts tiny thrusters almost 1600 times in a successful 
fourday maneuver designed to help the space probe reach jupiter in 
1995 
the thruster pulses completed late thursday slowed the 
spacecraft by about 55 mph said jim wilson spokesman for the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the next set of maneuvers on the 135 billion mission is 
scheduled for summer spokesman bob macmillin said monday 
the 28ton galileo was launched by the space shuttle atlantis 
on oct 18 
it flew past venus on feb 9 enabling the planet to act as a 
gravity slingshot and help propel the spacecraft on its looping 
24billionmile sixyear journey to jupiter the solar systems 
largest planet 
the spacecraft will fly past earth on dec 8 and again on dec 
8 1992 in two more gravity slingshot maneuvers 
galileo will examine earth the moon and one or two asteroids 
before it separates into an orbiter and a small probe in july 1995 
they arrive at jupiter in december 1995 
there the probe will parachute into the atmosphere and make 
measurements until intense heat and pressure vaporize it the 
orbiter will photograph and study jupiter and its major moons until 
late 1997 circling the planet instead of flying past it like the

in an effort to make land cheaper for japanese and 
more accessible to us companies the cabinet today proposed two 
bills that would promote construction on farmland and urban sites 
considered underdeveloped 
this will be a first concrete step on land policy to be 
taken by japan following japanus talks on changing business 
practices in the two countries said nobuyuki yamazaki an official 
of the construction ministrys city planning divison 
the bills are to be submitted to parliament for approval he 
said 
the proposals are intended to improve the supply of housing 
and residential land in major city areas by encouraging effective 
and intensive use of idle land and farmland construction minister 
tamisuke watanuki told the cabinet which approved the proposed 
legislation 
both proposals are aimed at targeting underutilized land for 
residential development and at lifting restrictions on residential 
construction 
one would require three major urban areas tokyo osaka in 
western japan and nagoya in central japan to designate priority 
areas to be developed as residential areas 
the other bill would authorize officials to designate idle and 
underutilized plots of 53800 square feet or more as areas to be 
developed for housing it also would double to 66 feet the maximum 
height of apartment buildings constructed on land originally used 
for farming 
yamazaki said a comprehensive national land policy would be 
compiled afer committees in the government and governing liberal 
democratic party develop proposals for tax reforms related to land 
use by this autumn 
in an interim report on bilateral structural talks between japan 
and the united states issued earlier this month the japanese 
government said it would take steps to increase the supply of 
housing and residential land 
spiraling land prices and a shortage of inexpensive housing are 
serious problems in japans major cities 
us trade negotiators have said that increasing the supply of 
affordable housing could lead to greater opportunities for foreign 
firms to sell products and services in japan 
there are now about 71659 acres of vacant or underutilized 
plots excluding farmland in the tokyo metropolitan area 
according to construction ministry estimates 
if about 27181 acres of that land including former factory 
sites were developed for residential use about 18 million new 
housing units could be built it says

lawsuits charging employers with violating a 
key federal antibias law may be filed in state as well as federal 
courts a unanimous supreme court ruled today 
the 90 ruling upheld a 27000 award won by a chicago ridge 
ill woman against her trucking company employer the yellow 
freight system co 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said we 
have no reason to question the presumption that state courts are 
just as able as federal courts to decide claims governed by the 
federal law 
lawyers for yellow freight urged the court to rule that coleen 
donnelly waited too long before filing a lawsuit invoking the law 
title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 barring onthejob 
discrimination 
mrs donnellys lawsuit invoked the federal law within a 
required 90day deadline but the case at that time was in an 
illinois state court 
lawyers for yellow freight said that does not meet the deadline 
requirement because they said federal courts have exclusive 
authority to hear title vii cases 
some federal appeals courts have ruled that such suits must be 
filed in federal court but the chicagobased 7th us circuit 
court of appeals ruled in favor of mrs donnelly and its decision 
was upheld today 
mrs donnelly applied to yellow freight for a job as a 
dockworker in october 1982 she was told the company was not hiring 
at the time but was advised she would be the next dockworker hired 
when yellow freight began hiring dockworkers agains in february 
1983 mrs donnelly was told the company still was not hiring 
she was hired 18 months later 
mrs donnelly in early 1985 filed charges with the federal equal 
employment opportunity commission alleging sexual bias in yellow 
freights delay in hiring her 
the commission issued a righttosue notice on march 15 1985 
triggering a 90day deadline for the suit to be filed 
mrs donnelly sued in state court before the deadline but her 
original lawsuit did not allege a title vii violation only a 
violation of the illinois human rights act the suit later was 
amended to included a claim that title vii was violated 
after yellow freight had the case transferred to federal court 
mrs donnelly was awarded 27656 in back pay and interest 
the case is yellow freight system vs donnelly 89431

nominee sen pete wilson

registered democrats interviewed supported feinstein 35 percent 
backed van de kamp the remaining voters 29 percent were 
undecided the primary is june 5

percentage might have resulted from the candidates recent 
television advertisements

it the public gets injured field said 
in a sampling of 1495 registered voters given possible general 
election matchups wilson led feinstein 46 percent to 38 percent

about even with van de kamp and behind feinstein

president bush called for more study into the 
causes of climate changes today and was immediately criticized for 
a goslow approach on the issue of global warming 
the president receiving only polite applause at the beginning 
and end of his address told delegates to an international 
conference on global warming environmental policies that ignore 
the economic factor the human factor are destined to failure 
bush repeatedly emphasized the link between environmental 
consequences and economic costs all of us must be certain we 
preserve our environmental wellbeing and our economic welfare 
bush said he called these two sides of the same coin 
however some delegates to the conference criticized the 
administrations cautious approach to dealing with the socalled 
greenhouse effect where pollutants released in the earths 
atmosphere are believed to trap sunlight and lead to warming of the 
planet 
gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide 
inaction said west germanys environmental minister klaus 
topfer in a statement 
he said the white house conference should include debate over 
what measures might be taken to curb globalwarming pollution 
bush told his audience that prominent scientists come down on 
both sides of the issue some claiming that failure to control 
airborne pollutants can lead to series global warming and others 
disputing such contentions 
where does that leave us bush asked what we need are 
facts the stuff that science is made of 
the presidents remarks opened a twoday white house conference 
as expected bush avoided making a specific commitment in his 
remarks 
attending the conference were government environmental economic 
and science officials from 18 nations and representatives from 
several international organizations 
i know theres a debate raging out there but im confident 
that this approach that brings all of you together is the way to 
go bush said 
bush cited congressional and white house cooperation on 
compromise cleanair legislation as a sign of a us commitment on 
cleaning up the environment 
he said that the debate over global warming often generates 
more heat than light 
bush carefully using the phrase climate change instead of 
global warming told his audience that recognizing the economic 
realities of the cost of environmental cleanup is in the interest 
of every nation here today 
bush said that in developing nations in particular curbing 
pollution is especially difficult 
in a climate of poverty or persistent economic struggle 
protecting the environment becomes a far more difficult challenge 
he added there is no better ally in service of our 
environment than strong economies 
some of the european delegates have called for industrial 
nations to make specific commitments on controlling socalled 
greenhouse pollutants such as carbon dioxide but the 
administration has refused to go that far 
the presidents science adviser allen bromley a cochairman of 
the conference recently criticized those who advocate slamdunk 
solutions to global warming when uncertainties remain 
the cautious approach taken by the white house has prompted some 
of the delegates to the conference to complain that the gathering 
is being used solely to promote the us position on global warming 
conference sources said monday that both the dutch and west 
german governments have complained about the conference agenda 
because it focuses exclusively on research efforts and does not 
provide an open giveandtake among delegates on possible response 
strategies 
west german chancellor helmut kohl made his displeasure known in 
a letter to bush according to the sources who asked not to be 
identified the dutch complained in letters to senior white house 
officials that the participants arent even given time in open 
sessions to address policy options other than additional research 
we want to discuss a response policy said pier vellinga 
a senior member of the dutch delegation the netherlands and 
several other european countries have favored an immediate 
commitment by industrial nations to stabilize carbon dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000 
vellinga said the europeans have waited eagerly for bush to 
convene the conference which he promised during his 1988 election 
campaign but they had expected it to focus on responses as well as 
research 
senior administration officials have emphasized in recent days 
that they view the conference as primarily a way to focus on the 
need for more research into global warming and to address the 
economic questions posed by the issue 
representatives to the meeting are senior cabinetlevel advisers 
on economics science and the environment from nations that include 
the european community japan and brazil 
us environmentalists also chastised bush for not focusing on 
pollution control efforts 
the sierra club called the conference an attempt by the 
administration to shift the focus away from environmental questions 
to economic ones 
the sierra club which has more than 500000 members said 
monday it plans to take that message to the public with a series of 
television advertisemets featuring actors such as william shatner 
john ritter and jane alexander 
some computer models have suggested the earth could warm by 4 to 
9 degrees fahrenheit over the next 60 years because heat is being 
trapped by pollution other studies however questioned whether 
the warming would be that severe because of uncertainties about the 
effect of clouds oceans and other factors

jury can deliver justice in the murder trial of a former houston 
police officer accused of killing a black woman 
testimony was to begin today in the trial of alex gonzales a 
white officer charged in the slaying of ida lee delaney the jury 
of 12 was selected monday for the trial which was moved to dallas 
because of publicity 
they could have gotten that jury makeup in houston i dont 
even know why they came to dallas to do this said ada edwards 
an organizer of the ida lee delaneybyron gillum justice committee 
gillum is a black man killed by police in a separate incident 
its not a surprise i just hope the process will carry itself 
out and that those people are people who will be willing to hear 
the entire story ms edwards said 
the state of texas is very happy with the jury said 
prosecutor don smyth we think theyll do a fine job as weve 
been telling everybody else this is not a racial case 
elsewhere more than 500 people monday mourned a black teenager 
fatally shot in the back by a white policeman in teaneck nj 
a grand jury was to begin hearing evidence in the case today a 
week after phillip pannell was killed by an officer responding to 
reports that the 16yearold was brandishing a gun 
no longer will we put up with public officials putting guns in 
the hands of people untrained to our needs said theo bolden a 
junior at teaneck high school speaking at pannells funeral at a 
baptist church in englewood 
a call for activism came in a letter from jesse jackson saying 
we must transform confusion into order fear into hope death 
into light 
gonzales 25 is accused of killing mrs delaney 50 last fall 
while off duty mrs delaney and gillum 24 were shot within two 
weeks of each other the officer suspected of shooting gillum was 
not indicted 
mrs delaney was driving to work on a freeway when gonzales and 
two other offduty officers chased her in an unmarked car 
authorities after she pulled over mrs delaney and gonzales 
exchanged fire 
the defense maintains mrs delaney fired first and gonzales 
acted in selfdefense 
the officers had been attending a birthday party at a nightclub 
for several hours before the shooting hospital records showed 
gonzales was intoxicated when he sought treatment for gunshot 
wounds to the abdomen 
pannell was shot by officer gary spath police said that 
officers believed the teenager was reaching for a gun and that a 
22caliber gun was found on the body some of the dead boys

the supreme court ruled today there is no 
constitutional right to take the hallucinogenic drug peyote as a 
religious practice 
the justices voting 63 said oregon officials may deny 
unemployment benefits to two fired drug counselors who ingested 
small amounts of peyote in indian religious ceremonies 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the first 
amendment does not permit people to break the law in the name of 
religious freedom 
we have never held that an individuals religious beliefs 
excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting 
the conduct that the state is free to regulate he said 
oregons drug laws do not regulate religious beliefs the 
communication of religious beliefs or the raising of ones children 
in those beliefs scalia added 
in a strongly worded dissent justice harry a blackmun accused 
the court of treating religious freedom for the first time as a 
luxury rather than an essential element of liberty 
todays ruling is a signal to indians that religious freedom for 
unorthodox practices is an unfulfilled and hollow promise 
blackmun said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
scalias opinion was joined by chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices byron r white john paul stevens and 
anthony m kennedy 
justice sandra day oconnor provided the sixth vote to deny the 
unemployment benefits to the fired drug counselors 
but she said in a separate concurring opinion that the five 
other justices in the majority went too far in limiting religious 
freedom 
oconnor said after weighing all the factors she believes 
oregon has a compelling interest in outlawing peyote use 
in other action the court 
made it more difficult for employers to withdraw recognition 
of a labor union representing striking workers after new employees 
are hired to break the strike 
by a 54 vote the justices reinstated a national labor 
relations board policy against presuming the new employees oppose 
the union 
ruled that lawsuits charging employers with violating a key 
federal antibias law may be filed in state as well as federal 
courts 
the 90 ruling upheld a 27000 award won by a chicago ridge 
ill woman against her trucking company employer the yellow 
freight system co 
the peyote case was before the nations highest court for the 
second time the justices in 1988 sent it back to the oregon 
supreme court to determine whether the religious use of peyote was 
a crime in that state 
the justices were seeking that guidance presumably because if 
a state can ban all peyote use outright it has the power to 
withhold unemployment benefits for those who use the drug 
but the oregon supreme court refused to answer the high courts 
question once again ruling that oregon may not deny unemployment 
compensation for use of peyote in a religious ceremony 
unlike oregon the federal government and most states exempt 
religious use of peyote from their criminal drug laws 
the fired workers in todays case galen w black and alfred c 
smith were counselors with the douglas county ore council on 
alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment adapt 
after each took small amounts of peyote as part of a native 
american church sacrament they were fired by adapt for violating 
company policy 
the rehabilitation program since has changed its policy and now 
permits employees to use peyote in religious services 
peyote is a cactus button containing the hallucinogen 
mescaline 
smith a klamath indian is a recovered alcoholic who said he 
has not taken a drink since 1957 
black is not an indian but converted to the native american 
church he worked for adapt while recovering from drug and alcohol 
abuse 
state officials have not disputed that both men sincerely 
believe peyote is a part of the churchs religious practices 
lawyers for both men said using small quantities of peyote in a 
church service is comparable to sacramental use of small quantities 
of wine in christian religious ceremonies 
but state officials said that if peyote is permitted in church 
ceremonies it will create a wedge for allowing other drugs such as 
marijuana to be used by other religious groups 
oregon officials also argued that creating an exception for 
peyote would be a violation of constitutionally required separation 
of church and state 
the case is oregon employment division vs smith 881213

hud affair a published report says 
the space was provided rentfree by hill amp knowlton inc a 
major public relations company that is prominent in washington 
lobbying the san jose mercury news reported sunday the 
congressional human rights foundation a private group headed by 
lantos has used the space since late 1988 the newspaper said

similarly named taxpayersupported organization founded by lantos 
the california democrat denied that he had violated ethical or 
financial guidelines 
hill amp knowlton was hired to represent former federal housing

the public when on may 8 he ruled that his house subcommittee would 
not question demery about important aspects of the inspector 
generals report

the supreme court today set some new 
guidelines for awarding interest payments to winners of antitrust 
lawsuits 
the 54 ruling in a case from new jersey is a partial victory 
for both sides in the dispute 
the case stems from a suit by the former owners of a new jersey 
company who accused kaiser aluminum and chemical corp of illegal 
monopoly practices 
the former owners of columbia metal culvert co in vineland 
nj which made aluminum drainage pipe said the company was 
driven out of business by kaiser 
they sued kaiser in 1974 and eventually were awarded more than 
95 million in damages 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals last year ruled the 
exowners are entitled to interest on the award from dec 2 1981 
until the award was paid by kaiser on july 3 1986 
the dec 2 date is the one on which a federal jury assessed the 
damages 
the supreme court today changed that date to dec 4 1981 the 
date on which the judgment was formally approved by a federal judge 
the high court rejected kaisers bid to base the interest 
payments on a period beginning july 1 1986 when a federal appeals 
court upheld the damage award 
the justices also rejected arguments by the former owners of the 
new jersey firm who wanted the operative date set at aug 16 1979 
when a federal jury first found kaiser guilty of antitrust 
violations 
the high court also ordered a lower court to determine the 
interest rate to be paid based on the prevailing rate on dec 4 
1981 
the 3rd circuit court had said the interest should be based on 
treasury bill rates the appeals court had applied the treasury 
bill rates retroactively since it was not until october 1982 that 
a federal law mandating the tbill rate in such cases took effect 
the high court today barred such retroactive application of the 
1981 law 
justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the court she was joined 
by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices john paul 
stevens antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
dissenting were justices byron r white william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun 
the cases are kaiser aluminum vs bonjorno 881595 and 
bonjorno vs kaiser 881771

the alleged ringleader in the whiteonblack 
slaying of a teenager boasted he was going to shoot blacks a 
prosecutor charged but the defense argued the man was falsely 
accused by a drugaddicted young woman 
ill show you shes a contemptible liar her mother is a 
contemptible liar stephen murphy screamed at the jury monday as 
keith mondello went on trial for murder in the slaying aug 23 in 
brooklyns bensonhurst section 
yusuf hawkins 16 was shot to death after he and three of his 
pals all black crossed paths with a mob of batwielding whites in 
the mostly italianamerican neighborhood the four blacks had gone 
to look at a used car 
the slaying raised racial tensions in the city in the middle of 
a mayoral campaign 
mondello who did not shoot hawkins but allegedly assembled the 
white gang had boasted that he would blow the heads off the 
nigger bastards assistant district attorney james kohler said 
it didnt matter what black man yusuf hawkins innocently 
appeared on the scene and his fate was sealed the prosecutor 
said 
a second jury sitting in the same courtroom had been scheduled 
to hear opening statements today in the murder trial of the accused 
gunman joseph fama but his lawyer was ill and the opening was 
postponed 
mondello and fama both 19 could receive 25 years to life in 
prison if convicted 
separate juries will hear testimony against the two defendants 
with one panel deciding the fate of mondello and the other the case 
against fama six other whites have been charged in the slaying and 
will be tried later 
murphy asserted his client was falsely accused by gina 
feliciano a key prosecution witness who he said is a habitual liar 
and an unreformed drug addict 
the lawyer said he would play for the jury a secretly recorded 
telephone conversation between miss feliciano and her sister that 
makes it real clear that the truth has nothing to do with 
anything 
a copy of the tape provided to reporters later monday appeared 
to shed little new light on the case 
murphy said the girl brought on the entire episode by inviting 
some black and hispanic friends to her birthday party in the 
neighborhood

a court today upheld an order to evict 150 
jewish settlers who rented churchowned buildings in the christian 
quarter of the walled old city despite protests by palestinian 
christians 
the settlement of the jews under police guard only days before 
easter raised tensions in the old city where traditionally 
moslems christians and jews have lived in separate and jealously 
guarded neighborhoods 
the settlers moved into the 72room complex last wednesday and 
set up the largest jewish settlement in the old city which israel 
captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the settlers said the four buildings were sublet to a panamanian 
company which rented to them the greek orthodox church contended 
the rental to the settlers was illegal 
avraham sochozolsky a lawyer for the greek orthodox church 
said he would next ask police to carry out the eviction order it 
was not clear however whether the settlers would be evicted 
immediately from the buildings which once served as a church 
hospice 
the threejudge panel of the jerusalem district court ruled that 
a stay of the eviction notice granted friday by a single district 
court judge was improperly obtained the action in effect 
reinstated the original eviction order issued by a magistrates 
court 
the judges have canceled the stay they the settlers must be 
evicted sochozolsky said 
the lawyers for the settlers said before the decision that they 
planned to appeal they left the court just after the ruling and 
were not available for comment 
the decision came after a fourhour closeddoor session 
presided over by judge vardimus zailer the panel also included 
judge shalom brenner who last thursday stayed the eviction order 
on monday a group of jews who ignited angry protests by moving 
into the christian quarter accused jewish mayor teddy kollek the 
greek orthodox church and other critics of being antisemitic 
shmuel evyatar a spokesman for the jewish settlers urged 
everyone in the enlightened world to denounce the horrifying 
antisemitism to which we are witness 
also monday a legislator said prime minister yitzhak shamir is 
exploiting political uncertainty during the formation of a new 
government to boost the jewish presence in the occupied lands 
lawmaker dedi zucker of the citizens rights movement told the 
associated press that shamir has approved preparations for four 
more settlements he said shamir also gave permission for a jewish 
residential building in the west bank city of nablus and for 
enlarging the jewish presence in the west bank town of hebron 
zucker said shamir was pushing the government settlement program 
at this time because its opponents are now outside his caretaker 
government 
shamir is using the fact that he has nobody to argue with 
inside the government zucker said referring to the 
leftofcenter labor party that wants to slow down the pace of 
settlements 
labor governed jointly with shamirs rightwing likud bloc but 
it left the coalition in a dispute over us peace proposals and 
then toppled the government on march 15 
shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir refused to comment on the 
specifics of zuckers charges mr zucker is the one who is 
acting against the national needs of our state and i dont want to 
react to statements by this man ahimeir said 
since capturing the west bank and gaza strip from arab neighbors 
in the 1967 middle east war israel has built 143 settlements 
which are home to about 75000 jews about 17 million palestinians 
live in the occupied lands 
the united states has criticized the settlements as an obstacle 
to peace

the space shuttle columbia will be 
launched one to two weeks late next month because of the delay in 
getting the shuttle discovery off the ground with the hubble space 
telescope nasa said today 
columbia originally was scheduled to lift off may 9 carrying an 
astronomical observatory known as astro that date is no longer 
feasible since discoverys second launch attempt is not until april 
25 
theres a rule of thumb that we like three weeks between 
launches said dick young a spokesman for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
nasa wants time to check discovery following its fiveday 
mission to see if anything needs to be changed before the next 
shuttles flight it will wait until discovery is launched before 
setting a new target date for columbia 
discoverys launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff 
april 10 because of a faulty auxiliary power unit the mission was 
postponed 15 days to allow replacement of the power unit and 
recharging of hubbles batteries discovery remains on the launch 
pad 
the newly installed power unit will be tested for five minutes 
wednesday the 15 billion telescope inside discoverys sealed 
payload bay will not be at risk nasa said 
hubbles six nickelhydrogen batteries are undergoing 130 hours 
of recharging they will be put back in the telescope on saturday 
the telescope is nasas most expensive and complex payload once 
in orbit 380 miles high it will enable astronomers to study stars 
and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to earth for 
14 billion years 
columbia was transferred from the orbiter processing facility to 
the vehicle assembly building on monday the move was delayed a few 
days so technicians could replace a leaking hydraulic part in the 
shuttles nose landing gear 
nasa plans to roll columbia out sunday to the second of the

the lawyer for a man who sued a hospital for 
keeping him alive after he suffered cardiac arrest in 1988 says he 
expects the lawsuit to continue despite his clients death 
edward h winter 84 died of a stroke saturday at the 
hillebrand nursing center where he had lived since may 1988 
winters lawyer william c knapp said monday he expects family 
members to try to recover from st francisst george hospital the 
100000 cost of winters nursing home care and damages for his 
emotional suffering 
legal and medical ethics experts have said the case could break 
new ground because hospitals traditionally have not been held 
liable for saving lives 
in the lawsuit filed last year in hamilton county common pleas 
court winter said that after a may 25 1988 heart attack he 
asked the hospital not to take any special measures to keep him 
alive 
he accused st francisst george staff members of disregarding 
his wishes and reviving him after a second heart attack two days 
later winter suffered a stroke that left him unable to walk talk 
or care for himself 
winters daughter lynn kroger said her father suffered 
mentally and physically after the stroke 
st francisst george hospital denies any wrongdoing and 
contends that winter didnt make clear to hospital staff that he 
issued orders not to perform lifesaving measures on him the 
hospital says it respects patients refusal of such treatment 
knapp said the administrator of winters estate will decide how 
much to seek in damages no administrator has yet been appointed 
funeral services are scheduled for wednesday

a ghostly ragtime melody floats through the air 
at the beginning of august wilsons the piano lesson 
its a haunting tune that makes the old upright piano in doaker 
charles pittsburgh living room in 1936 come alive with memories of 
a past that is very much a part of the present 
both past and present are the subjects of the piano lesson 
a mesmerizing history of one black family that refuses to give up 
either one the play won the 1990 pulitzer prize for drama last 
week and deservedly so 
the piano lesson which opened monday at broadways walter 
kerr theater is another installment in wilsons decadebydecade 
look at the black experience in american life and it is wilsons 
most accomplished work to date resonating with a poetry that 
enhances a strong story and illuminates a half dozen or so expertly 
drawn characters 
that piano dominates wilsons play and the stage it is the 
battleground between a brother boy willie and his sister 
berniece both of whom want the family heirloom for their own 
purposes 
berniece wants to keep the piano a symbol of the charles 
familys slave days down south boy willie wants to sell it to buy 
the land their ancestors worked 
the conflict between these grandchildren of slaves is revealed 
slowly but effectively by wilson the playwright is not afraid to 
take time to set up scenes and develop characters his persistence 
pays off 
wilson traces the pianos history from the time bernieces 
greatgrandmother and her grandfather then age 9 were sold to 
buy the instrument and how her greatgrandfather carved details of 
their history into its wood a lasting memory of its high price 
wilson also details how bernieces father helped steal the piano 
from its owners and lost his life in the process and how it 
eventually made its way to pittsburgh and the home of bernieces 
uncle doaker 
berniece sees the piano as a symbol of her familys survival 
she wont even play it preferring to let the piano sit as a museum 
piece in her uncles living room boy willie sees it as a means to 
a better life hes not afraid to use the past to build a better 
future 
the past takes on mythic even supernatural qualities in the 
play in fact the play ends in an exorcism of the past that pits 
boy willie against the ghosts of the family that once owned his 
forefathers its effectively melodramatic if not entirely 
convincing 
director lloyd richards best moments are small ones quiet 
scenes where the characters reveal their hopes for the future or 
funny bits particularly when one scamp of a character tries to 
fleece another man out of money for a suit 
charles s dutton is a towering boy willie both in size and 
spirit his boy willie is alternately ingratiating and calculating 
a man who knows what he wants and wont stop until he gets it but 
he is equally matched by the marvelous s epatha merkerson as the 
resolute berniece her dignified determination is quiet but by no 
means less effective 
there are sharply drawn portraits by the other actors including 
rocky carroll as boy willies naive friend and cohort in crime 
tommy hollis as bernieces suitor carl gordon as the strong 
dignified uncle doaker and particularly lou myers as an old 
reprobate uncle 
from ma raineys black bottom to fences to joe 
turners come and gone wilson demonstrated an ability to create 
specific universes filled with real people who speak with their 
own unique voices in the piano lesson these voices make for 
memorable theater

what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times the piano lesson is joyously 
an africanamerican play it has its own spacious poetry its own 
sharp angle on a nations history and its own palpable ghosts that 
roar right through the upstairs window of the household where the 
action unfolds 
howard kissel the daily news in this play as in joe 
turners come and gone wilson is trying to go beyond the poetic 
realism of fences into a combination of realism and mysticism 
as yet the attempt seems strained but wilsons efforts to find 
mystic depths in the everyday are important because they may help 
push the american theater beyond the mingy naturalism in which it 
seems so hopelessly mired 
clive barnes new york post the piano lesson is a play 
of magnificent confrontations this is a wonderful play that 
lights up man see it wonder at it and recognize it

soviet officials ordered drastic cuts in natural 
gas supplies to lithuania today putting into force a threatened 
economic embargo to break the baltic republics drive for 
independence lithuanians said 
soviet officials also plan to cut oil and gasoline to the 
republic on wednesday lithuanian officials said president mikhail 
s gorbachev had given lithuania until sunday to repeal laws 
enacted since the republics parliament declared independence march 
11 
lithuanian residents had been forming long lines at gasoline 
stations in recent days to fill up for what they feared might be 
the last time 
implementing the orders of the government of the soviet union 
and those of the state gas concern supplies of natural gas ot 
the lithuanian soviet socialist republic will be sharply reduced 
from the 17th of april said a telegram sent by a soviet gas 
official to lithuanian authorities 
rita dapkus a spokeswoman for the lithuanian supreme council 
confirmed the telegrams text which was broadcast on the 
republics official radio and monitored by the british broadcasting 
corp in london 
no official announcement was made immediately in moscow 
president bush said his administration is studying how to 
respond if moscow carries out the threats but he refused to 
elaborate 
were waiting to see if the soviet announcements are 
implemented bush said clearly those announcements are 
contrary to the approach that we have urged and that others have 
urged upon the soviet union 
we are considering appropriate responses if these threats are 
implemented bush said and im going to leave it right there 
teresa juodenienie a secretary for premier kazimiera 
prunskiene said in a telephone interview that the lithuanian 
government received a telephone warning from the druzhba or 
friendship enterprise that supplies oil to lithuania saying that 
deliveries of oil and gasoline will be curtailed beginning 
wednesday 
she said the telegram announcing the natural gas reduction was 
sent only to lithuanias gas authority rather than to the 
government and that officials did not immediately know whether the 
cut already had taken effect and what percentage would be reduced 
the news came after lithuanias parliament convened today to 
define a response to gorbachevs ultimatum threatening an economic 
blockade 
the republics prime minister sent gorbachev a telegram on 
monday seeking a meeting to negotiate moscows objections to laws 
enacted in the baltic state promoting its march 11 independence 
decree 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said lithuanias leaders 
were ready to discuss allowing residents who so desire to remain 
soviet citizens and permitting lithuanians to join the soviet army 
if they so choose 
she also expressed a willingness to discuss the protection of 
borders 
the main goal of negotiations is to realize independence or 
how the soviet union can get out of this situation and out of 
lithuania lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis was quoted 
as telling legislators today 
the parliamentary session was televised live in lithuania said 
edwardas potashinskas of lithuanian tv who reported landsbergis 
remarks 
gorbachev on friday gave lithuania 48 hours to rescind laws on 
those issues or face a cutoff of products the soviet union supplies 
to the republic he described as unconstitutional such 
lithuanian proposals as releasing lithuanian youth from the annual 
spring conscription into the soviet army and introducing the 
republics own identity cards 
gorbachev did not specify what supplies could be cut off but 
lithuania depends on the kremlin for oil gas machinery raw 
materials chemicals and automobiles 
gorbachev has refused to meet with lithuanians unless the 
republic backs away from its independence declaration and there was 
no immediate response to the telegram from prunskiene 
in her telegram prunskiene said a broad economic boycott would 
damage both the soviet and lithuanian economies 
lithuanias chief of foreign trade rimantas purtulis told 
reporters that gas supplies would last a month and oil three to 
four months according to daina kalendra of the parliaments press 
office 
lithuania gets its oil and gas from the soviet union at prices 
much lower than world market prices the republic has little 
foreign currency to buy fuel from the west 
some economic sanctions against lithuania could backfire on the 
soviet union journalist vilius kavaliauskas quoted one official in 
the leadership as saying among them 
if moscow embargoed muchneeded chemical fertilizers that 
will mean less meat and dairy products for the 14 other soviet 
republics 
if a natural gas pipeline were shut down the russian district 
of kaliningrad wedged between lithuania and poland would be hurt 
a cutoff of supplies for the drob textile mill would also 
disrupt deliveries to a leningrad factory that employs more than 
18000 people 
kavaliauskas said his source said the republic has enough 
newsprint for four or five days 
western correspondents have been barred by soviet authorities 
from lithuania since last month and the soviet military has sought 
to assert its authority in the republic by seizing and beating 
deserters from the army and parading armored vehicles through the 
streets 
landsbergis said monday that the other two baltic republics 
estonia and latvia promised aid in the face of an embargo but 
gave no details ms kalendra reported 
the three baltic states were forcibly annexed by the soviet 
union in 1940 latvia and estonia also are seeking independence 
but moving more cautiously

the justice department today sought records of 
754 us bank accounts that it says once contained 400 million in 
illegal drug profits amassed by colombian drug lords 
the cepartment asked federal judges in atlanta new york and 
miami to direct 173 banks in 23 states to produce records of the 
accounts 
prosecutors also sought to freeze 684 accounts which they said 
were linked to eduardo martinez romero who was extradited last 
september from colombia to face charges of laundering money for the 
medellin cartel 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement that the 
action was the fourth phase in the justice departments longrunning 
operation polar cap investigation of colombian cocaine trafficking 
in this country 
the action seeks to lift the veil of secrecy over the 
financial network of these narcoterrorists including pablo 
escobar and jorge ochoa thornburgh said in a statement 
operation polar cap conducted by the drug enforcement 
administration and other federal law enforcement agencies 
determined that the cartel made 12 billion selling cocaine on 
american streets between 1987 and 1989 officials said 
through a complicated set of wire transfers involving banks in 
eight foreign countries 400 million ended up in the banks from 
which the records are being sought officials said other money was 
invested in foreign countries or was used to buy supplies and 
equipment for cocaine production officials said 
justice department trial attorney peter g djinis said 
investigators traced the money dollar for dollar through banks 
in colombia panama uruguay luxembourg switzerland britain 
canada and austria 
investigators have been reviewing the bank records for almost a 
year with the cooperation of the eight foreign governments 
officials said they do not know how much of the 400 million 
remains in the accounts but djinis said the records are expected 
to help investigators continue their pursuit of the international 
money trail left by the cocaine dealers 
we think this is going to point fingers in a lot of 
directions he said and could help investigators identify 
additional assets of the colombian cartel as well as individuals 
involved in its illegal activities 
the justice department believes the records will confirm 
suspicions that the cartel bought real estate in this country he 
said 
most of the accounts were located in miami and new york because 
many of the people who used them lived in those cities djinis said 
many of the accounts were kept in the name of martinez and 
others were held for nominees including the 2yearold daughter of 
a member of the cartel 
the funds were kept in us banks to finance the purchase of 
airplanes equipment and to keep up the payroll djinis said 
the only way to administer these activities is to have ongoing 
capital in the us he said 
there was no evidence the banks in which the accounts were kept 
were anything other than unwitting service providers said 
david runkel the departments chief spokesman 
but djinis said a review of the bank records may lead 
investigators to a different conclusion we are not ruling out 
anything he said 
nevertheless he said we are not at this time suggesting the 
banks had knowledge and were knowing and willing participants in 
the return of the funds to the us

president bush today warned moscow that the 
united states would make appropriate responses if the soviet 
union carries out a threat to cut back drastically on natural gas 
and other fuel supplies to lithuania 
bush refused to say what steps might be taken we are 
considering appropriate responses if these threats are 
implemented bush said 
in an interview monday with a group of foreign journalists the 
president said i want to be sure anything we do is productive 
theres been dramatic change in the world and i dont want to 
inadvertently take some action that would set it back 
and yet i dont want to be seen as one who is not interested 
in the peaceful change and in the selfdetermination for 
lithuania bush said in the interview a transcript of his 
remarks was released today 
bush issued his warning after soviet officials ordered sharp 
cuts in natural gas supplies to lithuania and said reductions in 
oil and gasoline will begin on wednesday 
obviously we are watching the situation very very closely 
bush said commenting during a picturetaking session in the oval 
office with visiting president rafael callejas of honduras 
were waiting to see if the soviet announcements are 
implemented bush said clearly those announcements are 
contrary to the approach that we have urged and that others have 
urged upon the soviet union 
we are considering appropriate responses if these threats are 
implemented bush said and im going to leave it right there 
bush concluded by saying what we need is dialogue discussion 
and a peaceful resolution of this great difficulty there 
the president planned to meet on the subject later in the day 
with senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who led a 
senate delegation to moscow last week and minority leader bob 
dole rkan both lawmakers have criticized the soviet ultimatum 
dole said congress might act on its own to retaliate 
economically against moscow if it escalated its efforts to block 
lithuanias drive toward independence 
mitchell said gorbachevs threat was contrary to the assurances 
that he and other senators had received from the soviet leader in 
moscow that force or intimidation would not be used 
the president has repeatedly warned that soviet pressures 
against lithuania put ussoviet relations at risk 
at a news conference last friday bush told moscow that now is 
no time for escalation its time for talk he made the comment 
after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev set a 48hour deadline 
for lithuania to revoke legislation it had passed since its march 
11 declaration of independence or face cutoff of critical supplies 
in recent weeks highlevel us officials have been meeting to 
consider what steps the administration might take in response to 
various soviet actions against lithuania most of the options 
apparently involve economic measures such as denying moscow 
improved trade status or blocking its entry into international 
economic organizations

thousands of oklahoma teachers abandoned 
their classrooms to protest the failure of a school funding bill 
and union officials called for more teachers to join the walkout 
today 
many of the teachers picketed at the state capitol on monday 
and hundreds swarmed the halls lobbying for the failed 230 
million education package hundreds returned to the capitol today 
to walk a picket line 
some school administrators supported the walkout others opposed 
it 
the oklahoma city school board today oted to used a leftover 
snow day to allow teachers to join the protest thursday oklahoma 
city schools the second largest district in the state with 38000 
students were open monday 
in order for us to make this work our numbers need to grow 
each day kyle dahlem president of the oklahoma education 
association said monday as the union kicked off a fiveday teacher 
walkout 
speaking at the capitol ms dahlem called for the closing of 
more schools throughout the week and demonstrations at the capitol 
and local schools 
nancy jewell union vice president estimated that more than 
10000 took part in mondays protest at the capitol other 
estimates ranged up from 5000 
the union called the walkout after the oklahoma senate failed 
last week to pass the school bill as an emergency measure which 
would have put it into effect immediately 
the union today said it thought the strike was gaining strength 
spokeswoman carla feeley said 139 of the states 606 school 
districts were closed today down from the more than 145 closed 
monday 
but she said more teachers from districts that remain open have 
joined the strike she estimated that 18600 teachers or 60 
percent of the unions 31000 members are participating in the 
walkout 
the state had 40052 teachers in the 198889 school year 
gov henry bellmon asked attorney general robert henry to go to 
court if necessary to prevent illegal strike activity henry said 
state law forbidding strikes against school boards did not appear 
to apply in the case of a walkout to protest legislative action 
bellmon had opposed the strike although he backs the education 
package 
the decision by a significant number of oklahoma teachers 
administrators and school board members to interrupt the 
educational process is deeply regretted bellmon said 
the tulsa school district the largest in the state was closed 
monday and again today 
senate president pro tempore bob cullison said there were 
discussions over the weekend about reviving the school bill 
the education package the end product of an eightmonth 
special session provides an additional 212 million in funding 
for schools and sponsors said much of the money could be used to 
upgrade teacher pay 
teachers say their pay ranks 48th in the nation under the bill 
the minimum pay for a beginning teacher with a bachelors degree 
would go from about 15000 a year to about 24000 a year 
much of the opposition was stirred by the plan for taxes to 
support the reforms including a halfcent increase in the states 
4cent sales tax and increases in corporate and personal income 
taxes

next 50 years the general accounting office said 
elsewhere the report said employment was expected to fall 26 
percent in the rocky mountain region 23 percent in the north and 
13 percent on the pacific coast 
however the south is expected to post the largest harvest 
increase over the next five decades from about 8 billion cubic 
feet to nearly 14 billion cubic feet 
the north is expected to nearly double its 1986 harvest of 4 
billion cubic feet by 2040 while the pacific coast and rocky 
mountain regions are forecast to show only slight gains from their 
1986 levels to about 6 billion and 2 billion cubic feet 
respectively

the food and drug administration on tuesday 
approved a new biological product to help protect kidney transplant 
patients from a potentially fatal infection 
the product cytomegalovirus immune globulin intravenous or 
cmvigiv contains cytomegalovirus antibodies giving the patient 
the ability to fight cmv infections that can be carried by donated 
kidneys the fda said 
the virus is common in the united states and is usually 
harmless but when it is carried by a donated kidney transplant 
patients often are unable to fight its uncontrolled spread to other 
critical organs because their immune systems have been weakened 
with drugs to prevent rejection of the new organ 
the infections are serious in transplant patients and can be 
fatal 
the new product will enlarge the pool of donated kidneys 
available to people who have no cytomegalovirus antibodies people 
who have been infected with the virus earlier in their lives 
already have the antibodies necessary to ward off cmv infection and 
do not need cmvigiv the fda said 
the immune globulin has been available for transplant patients 
since october 1987 under the fdas program to investigate new 
drugs which allows patients with serious or lifethreatening 
conditions to get experimental drugs 
cmvigiv has no major side effects but it has been associated 
with flushing chills muscle cramps back pain fever nausea 
vomiting and wheezing in a small number of patients the fda said 
it should not be given to patients sensitive to immunoglobulin a 
the agency said 
the product was developed under the fdas orphan drug program by 
the massachusetts public health biologic laboratories of jamaica 
plain mass the program provides financial incentives to develop 
therapies for serious but rare diseases 
the product is being distributed by the american red cross 
northeast region which can be contacted in massachusetts at

the supreme court left unresolved today a 
conflict between federal agencies and their employees unions 
stemming from the government policy of contracting out buying 
certain goods and services from private businesses 
the justices said a dispute between the internal revenue service 
and a federal employee union should be restudied by a federal 
appeals court or by the federal labor relations authority 
the flra resolves collective bargaining disputes between federal 
agencies and their employees 
by a 63 vote the court struck down a flra ruling that would 
have forced agencies to negotiate with unions over how to resolve 
contractingout disputes 
justice antonin scalia wrote for the court that the authority 
wrongly ruled the irs must negotiate with the national treasury 
employees union over a contract proposal to submit contractingout 
disputes to arbitration 
we do not lightly overturn the flras construction of the act 
the civil service reform act of 1978 it is charged with 
administering scalia said however we conclude that the 
flras construction is not reasonable 
but scalia said the court was leaving unanswered whether some 
other legal basis exists for forcing agencies to negotiate over 
such contract proposals 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
the case is irs vs flra 882123

the attorney for joseph hazelwood has filed 
notice that the former exxon valdez skipper will appeal his 
conviction on one count of negligent discharge of oil 
hazelwood was acquitted by a superior court jury on march 22 of 
more serious charges that he had been drunk and reckless when the 
tanker ran aground on a reef in prince william sound 
the grounding resulted in the nations worst oil spill nearly 
11 million gallons of crude oil gushed into the waters and along 
hundreds of miles of shorelines 
the notice off appeal was sent late last week from fairbanks and 
arrived at superior court on monday after the court certifies the 
notice defense attorneys have 30 days to file the appeal brief 
dick madson a defense attorney based in fairbanks said the 
appeal will argue that hazelwood was immune from prosecution 
because of federal and state laws that protect ship captains from 
prosecution if they immediately report a spill 
hazelwood was ordered to pay 50000 restitution and to perform 
1000 hours of community service cleaning the waterway

housing starts continued to fall in march from 
their january peak the government reported tuesday but many 
analysts said the decline had bottomed out 
the commerce department reported that starts of new homes and 
apartments fell 93 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 132 million units a pace many analysts said 
probably would continue 
we might see levels like we had in march during most of the 
rest of the year said economist thomas holloway of the mortgage 
bankers association 
the drop was the sharpest since a 124 percent plunge in january 
1989 but was expected after starts jumped 232 percent to an 
annual rate of 157 million units during januarys record warm 
weather 
they slipped to 146 million in february still well above the 
level of the last 11 months of 1989 as unusually warm weather 
continued 
it isnt so much that housing is plunging as it is a 
correction in the data to the bulge earlier this year which 
couldnt be sustained said allen sinai chief economist for the 
boston co 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association noted that all of the decline was in singlefamily 
homes which fell 12 percent to an annual rate of 102 million 
units 
nevertheless berson added the march rate still is a very 
good number better than most months of 1989 singlefamily 
starts totaled 1 million last year 
on the other hand multifamily starts gained 09 percent to an 
annual rate of 306000 up a tad but still at an abysmally low 
number said david seiders chief economist for the national 
association of home builders 
apartment starts plunged 353 percent in february after a 371 
percent jump the previous month in addition to the weather 
analysts had attributed the january gain to builders wanting to get 
construction under way before expensive new regulations designed to 
make apartments more accessible to the handicapped went into effect 
seiders blamed the incredible weakness in apartment starts 
on fair housing regulations for the handicapped that he said would 
add as much as 3000 to the cost of multifamily units and on a 
construction credit crunch brought on by the august savings and 
loan bailout law 
the biggest decline in starts was experienced the northeast 
where the real estate industry has been in the doldrums in recent 
months they were down 378 percent to 138000 units after 
advancing 321 percent in february 
we though we had seen hopeful signs in the northeast 
seiders said but it clearly was a temporary weatherbased 
effect now its showing it is the weakest housing component in the 
country 
other declines were posted in the south down 115 percent to 
524000 units and the west down 05 percent to 376000 units 
the midwest registered the only gain up 68 percent to 293000 
units 
applications for building permits often a barometer of future 
housing activity fell 76 percent after dropping 252 percent the 
previous month 
the 121 million applications were the lowest since 115 million 
permits were sought in october 1982

they are the staple neckwear of presidents 
politicians and power brokers they brighten drab suits and look 
great on tv they are to establishment businessmen what sansabelt 
slacks are to golfers 
at a time when the variety of mens neckties has never been 
greater people are seeing red the traditional riskfree hue for 
ties no matter if they come with polka dots paisleys prints 
patterns stripes or geometric designs 
red is the brightest color that goes with all mens suits in a 
business environment said tiedesigner alan flusser who created 
the neckwear for michael douglas in wall street the tale of 
yuppie greed in the 1980s 
it gives new life to somber conservative business suits he 
said 
but be advised flussers personal tie rack is devoid of red 
the reasoning is similar to what yogi berra once said about a 
nightspot being too popular nobody goes there anymore its too 
crowded 
red is too obvious a color said flusser whose only 
concession to red are his luxurious woven jacquards in claret 
burgundy or bordeaux 
but in places like the nations capital crimson is red hot in 
the corridors of power 
president bush favors them tv anchormen love them and abcs 
sam donaldson wears red ties so often theyve become a personal 
trademark donald trump flashes them the same way he runs business 
unblushingly 
some trace reds staying power to the 1988 presidential 
campaign when politicians outdid themselves to prove their 
redblooded patriotism without sticking their necks out 
i saw one democratic debate when all seven of the candidates 
had a blue suit white shirt and red tie it was like a uniform 
said bob beauchamp fashion editor for esquire magazine 
the necktie is the only part of a mans wardrobe that has no 
function other than to decorate 
the average man owns 30 to 40 ties although only 10 to 15 of 
them are worn regularly according to the neckware association of 
america a new yorkbased industry trade group it said about 95 
million are sold each year and red can be found more than any 
other color 
a tie allows room for selfexpression said the 
associations jerry anderson its probably the most noticeable 
item he wears it says more about your personality than a suit or a 
shirt 
fashion forecasters note the mainstream tie is widening from 3 
to 3 inches some risktakers are even pushing the 4inch barrier 
anderson said 
and for those who are bloody tired of red take heart the 
latest look is called retro for retrospective a back to the 
future concept that revives the splashy patterns of the forties and 
fifties 
youve had a conservative look for a number of years 
anderson said men want to look fresh and different its time 
for a change 
the new look is embodied by hipster arsenio hall or the trendy 
characters on la law or thirtysomething bruce mertz 
president of format inc a chicago company that makes retro ties 
has already buried power ties even the trendy tealcolored hues 
if you see a guy wearing a yellow tie hes really out of 
fashion he hasnt bought a new necktie hes sleeping mertz 
told the chicago tribune theyre gone finished you dont see 
anybody wearing them 
meanwhile new york tie designer joseph abboud would rather be 
dead than red 
men fall into safety zones they see somebody else wearing 
red so they wear it too they all look like airline pilots said 
abboud who makes ties for nbcs bryant gumbel 
i think weve got to get the politicans to be a little more 
daring he said red lacks originality or individuality its 
archaic its old news you run the risk of being extremely boring 
and repetitive 
im not telling people to wear naked ladies on their tie but 
they can be freer and not as regimented my whole goal is to design 
ties for a man whos a leader not a follower someone willing to 
step out and be his own man abboud said 
now about those black socks

consumer prices surged an unexpectedly sharp 
05 percent in march pushing the inflation rate for the first 
three months of 1990 to its highest level in almost eight years 
the government reported today 
the labor department blamed last months increase in the 
consumer price index in large part on a jump in housing costs and 
another surge in new clothing prices although there were 
widespread increases in a variety of retail areas 
the 05 percent rise matched februarys gain and followed a 11 
percent increase in january 
private economists were caught by surprise by the brisk march 
advance which they termed a disappointing sign that inflation was 
not slowing as they had hoped many analysts had been looking for a 
modest increase of around 02 percent 
the cpi shows an entrenched unacceptably high rate of 
inflation said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the inflation result was dangerous and potentially devastating 
for financial markets and the economy 
through the first three months of the year consumer prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 85 percent that is the fastest 
quarterly increase since the spring of 1982 and is far above the 
46 percent price increase for all of 1989 
todays bad inflation news was likely to strengthen the resolve 
of the federal reserve to resist pressures from the bush 
administration to lower interest rates sinai predicted that if 
inflation does not retreat soon the fed may even begin pushing 
interest rates upward something it has not done for over a year 
in an effort to dampen price pressures 
the message is that it may take more pain more restraint on 
the economy to get inflation down to acceptable levels he said 
in other economic reports today the government reported that 
industrial production rose 07 percent in march while the nations 
factories mines and utilities operated at 833 percent of 
capacity an increase of 04 percentage point reflecting a rebound 
in auto production 
however housing construction fell by 93 percent its second 
monthly decline and the biggest setback in more than a year the 
commerce department said new homes and apartments were being built 
at an annual rate of 132 million units in march 
on wall street stock prices posted broad declines with traders 
attributing the weakness to the higherthanexpected inflation 
figure which dashed hopes that the federal reserve might relent 
and lower interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off more than 
13 points in early trading but by 1 pm had recouped some of the 
losses and was down by 473 points 
in the inflation report housing costs climbed 05 percent in 
march pushed upward by a sharp 1 percent rise in the cost of 
owning a home homeowners cost had actually fallen 01 percent in 
february 
the advance in housing costs accounted for almost onehalf of 
the overall march increase 
higher clothing costs contributed to more than onefifth of the 
increase as apparel prices rose by 16 percent following a record 
33 percent increase in february 
many economists had been looking for prices to moderate in 
march aided by lower food and energy costs 
energy prices were down during the month dropping by 08 
percent pushed lower by falling gasoline prices and another big 
drop in home heating oil costs 
food prices rose 04 percent during the month slightly better 
than the 05 percent increase in february as a big drop in fruit 
and vegetable prices offset increase in other areas 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors were up 
sharply as well in march climbing 07 percent the fastest 
increase since a 08 percent rise in december economists believe 
this core rate is a better gauge of underlying inflationary 
pressures 
the 85 percent annual rate of increase for the first three 
months of the year was the fastest advance since a 101 percent 
increase in the spring of 1982 
rising food prices accounted for about onefourth of the price 
acceleration so far this year 
clothing costs which rose just 1 percent for all of 1989 were 
up at an annual rate of 214 percent during the first three months 
of this year 
the department gave the following details of the price report 
fruit and vegetable costs which had been driven higher by 
decembers killer freeze retreated slightly in march but prices 
for meat poultry fish and eggs were up by 07 percent 
gasoline prices fell by 14 percent the first decline this 
year while heating oil prices dropped by 34 percent following a 
161 percent plunge in february fuel oil costs have been on a 
roller coaster this year surging 269 percent in january in 
response to unusually cold weather in december 
the 16 percent increase in clothing costs was led by a 27 
percent increase in the cost of womens and childrens clothing 
mens clothing costs were up 06 percent 
the various changes left the consumer price index at 1287 
before seasonal adjustments that meant that a hypothetical 
selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 198284 base 
period would have cost 12870 last month up from 12250 a year 
ago 
one reason the 05 percent march increase took analysts by 
surprise was that it followed a more benign report on inflation at 
the wholesale level the government reported last friday that 
prices one step short of retail actually fell by 02 percent in 
march

street battles raged tuesday in the 
moslem and christian sectors of beirut sparked by separate power 
struggles for control of the shiite moslem and maronite christian 
communities 
clashes also broke out in the southern port of sidon between the 
israelibacked south lebanon army and the leftist nasserite 
militia police said one nasserite militiaman was killed and two 
were wounded 
police said at least seven people were killed and 38 wounded in 
fighting between rival shiite moslem factions using machine guns 
assault rifles and grenade launchers in syrianpoliced west beirut 
and the citys southern slums 
some of the clashes were in the hajjaj neighborhood in south 
beirut one block from the barracks believed to be the most 
frequent prison for 18 western hostages it was not known if the 
fighting affected the captives 
the barracks belong to the proiranian hezbollah or party of 
god the umbrella group for factions believed to hold most of the 
hostages 
the shiite clashes later spread to south lebanons iqlim 
eltuffah or apple province where four people were wounded 
according to police 
in the christian sector of east beirut troops loyal to gen 
michel aoun and lebanese forces militia chieftain samir geagea 
skirmished with mortars and machine guns no casualties were

control of the christian enclave north and east of beirut 
according to police 875 people have been killed and 2376 
wounded since the christian battles began jan 30 
the shiite confrontation pits the fundamentalist hezbollah 
against the syrianbacked more secular amal militia the militias 
are fighting for control of lebanons shiites 
the latest clashes erupted a day after ali abu hassan an amal 
leader was killed by unidentified assailants in west beirut amal 
blamed the killing on hezbollah which denied the charge 
amal fighters raided west beirut homes overnight seizing some 
hezbollah members in apparent revenge 
each side blamed the other for the latest round of fighting 
which started in west beirut around 4 am and spread to the 
southern slums by noon 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem pleaded with both 
factions to stop fighting immediately and have mercy on the 
population 
the syrian command deployed foot patrols in an effort to 
disengage the combatants but met with limited success 
they stop fighting when the syrian patrol is in an area and 
resume their war after the patrols leave said a police spokesman 
however he said the syrians appear determined to halt the 
fighting and were bringing in more troops to establish control in 
the disputed districts 
the syrians control most of lebanon with about 40000 troops 
sent under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
voice of the nation the main moslem radio station in lebanon 
repeatedly broadcast urgent appeals from hospitals for blood 
donations and pleas from civilians for a ceasefire 
let them go to hell why do we have to pay the price for their 
dirty war said one civilian amina ghandour ghandour told the 
radio station that the fighting had left three floors of her 
apartment building on fire

philadelphia mayor wilson goode said tuesday 
the federal government has mixed up its priorities by planning to 
spend billions of dollars more on bailing out the savings and loan 
industry than on fighting illegal drugs 
for some reason we cant get the people who list priorities to 
put this above savings and loans goode told a house hearing on 
the narcotics problem the lives of our young people are more 
important than these buildings and these investors who put money in 
savings and loans 
goode testifying for the us conference of mayors called for 
more federal funding to stem demand for narcotics grants provided 
directly to city governments and freedom for local officials to 
respond to the drug crisis based upon their own particular 
experiences and insights 
he urged a greater emphasis on treatment for drug abusers he 
said he visited the 25 worst drug corners in philadelphia last 
year and was repeatedly told by addicts we need some way to get 
off this train i got caught up in this by mistake and now i need 
something that works 
goode told the government operations committee the 102 billion 
earmarked in recent legislation to fight drugs is simply not 
enough to have a meaningful impact across the entire nation 
instead he said federal funding should match the amount the 
government will pay to combat the financial calamities besetting 
the savings and loan industry estimates of that cost have ranged 
up to 200 billion 
he also criticized the idea of legalizing narcotics a concept 
that has gained currency in recent months among those who believe 
that the problem is so overwhelming that a war against it is 
virtually guaranteed to fail 
goode called it a very bad idea that some very smart people 
are lending their endorsement to he said legalization would 
flood the nation with narcotics and set an inappropriate moral 
tone 
this would be the worst domestic policy decision that we as a 
nation could make bar none he said

the nuclear regulatory commission must 
establish training requirements for workers in the nuclear power 
industry an appeals court said today 
the us circuit court of appeals said the nrc has circumvented 
a congressional mandate by failing to adopt regulations called for 
in a 1983 law 
a presidential panel examining the accident at three mile island 
said inadequate training contributed significantly to the risks 
posed by nuclear power plants the court noted in its opinion 
the nrc issued a policy statement in 1985 which encourages but 
does not compel nuclear plant operators to create training programs 
the nrc concluded that the best way to get civilian nuclear 
power plants to improve training was to create a model training 
code and urge utilities to comply with it voluntarily 
public citizen a group founded by ralph nader challenged the 
nrcs approach in lawsuits in 1986 and 1988 the nrc reconsidered 
the training issue in 1988 and decided not to impose requirements 
congress directed the nrc to create mandatory requirements for 
civilian nuclear powerplant licensee personnel training programs 
and the commission has failed to do so said the 30 decision 
by chief appeals court judge patricia wald 
the case was returned to the nrc for further proceedings 
consistent with the court ruling 
the 1983 law an amendment to the nuclear waste policy act says 
the nrc shall establish instructional requirements for 
civilian nuclear powerplant licensee personnel training programs 
the nrc relied on other language in the amendment which allows 
the agency to issue appropriate regulatory guidance 
the appeals court said that while the term regulatory 
guidance is ambiguous other language mandating the instructional 
requirements is clear and controls the issue 
the nrc and the industry argued that imposing mandatory 
requirements will make the nuclear power industry less safe because 
it will choke off the industrys selfregulatory efforts 
the argument is that the companies will regard the nrcs 
requirements as a maximum rather than a minimum level of 
appropriate training 
the nrc and the industry must take this argument to the 
congress not to the courts said the appeals panel 
voluntary industry training was under way at the time congress 
passed the law and the nrcs model training code is exactly what 
congress did not want to perpetuate said david vladeck an 
attorney for the public citizen litigation group

gov tommy g thompson defended his veto of 
a bill requiring public schools to teach students about date rape 
saying younger pupils didnt need exposure to such lessons 
the bill passed during the legislatures winter session called 
for instruction three times between the first and 12th grade on how 
to recognize and prevent sexual assaults particularly those that 
can happen with an acquaintance on a date 
in vetoing the bill monday the governor said he feared it could 
force teachers to talk about date rape to children between grades 
one and three i didnt know these students dated he said 
thompson said he also believed the bill duplicated a state law 
that already requires school districts to provide instruction in 
preventing sexual abuse of which sexual assault could be argued to 
be a subcategory 
he noted that he recently signed a law requiring the university 
of wisconsin system and vocational technical and adult education 
system to teach incoming freshmen how to avoid sexual assault 
he also expressed concern that a provision in the bill requiring 
the state to pay a sum sufficient to cover the lessons would 
give school boards a blank check 
milwaukee county assistant district attorney john dimotto head 
of his offices sexual assault unit criticized the veto 
although the schools teach sexualassault awareness and 
prevention dimotto said there is nothing that specifically 
addresses the issue of date rape which can and does affect many 
youths 
dimotto said about 35 percent of the sexual assaults handled by 
his unit involved acquaintances of the victims 
linda willsey committee clerk for state rep barbara notestein 
who sponsored the bill said the governor was confused about 
existing law 
there is a protective behavior statute ms willsey said 
but it applies to elementary school students only our 
concern mainly was with acquaintance rape and sexual assault among 
teenagers and high school kids 
according to ms notestein about half of the 5100 sexual 
assaults reported in wisconsin in 1987 involved teenage girls

onethird of the senate candidates this year 
got more money from outofstate individuals than they did from 
local contributors according to the federal election commission

senators seeking reelection raised more individual contributions 
of at least 200 from outofstate residents than from state 
residents 
some nonincumbent candidates also received more 200plus 
donations from outofstate individuals than from state residents 
particularly in states where the current senator is not seeking 
reelection 
while it still is early in the campaign the 23 senate 
candidates raising most of their individual contributions from 
outofstate are below the number who did in 1988 and 1986 
in 1988 29 of the 66 candidates for 33 senate seats received 
more campaign funds through individual contributions of 500 or 
more from outside than at home in 1986 31 of the 68 candidates 
for 34 seats did the same

contributions from business labor and special interest political 
action committees or pacs also not reflected is smaller 
contributions less than 200 per individual last year and less 
than 500 in the 198788 and 198586 election cycles 
two incumbent candidates already have raised more than 1 
million in large individual donations from outside their states 
leading the pack is incumbent sen rudy boschwitz rminn who has 
raised 134 million outside his state or about triple the 462331 
from instate donors of 200 or more 
close behind is sen bill bradley dnj with nearly 13 
million in large outofstate contributions compared with 474569 
from new jersey residents 
former ku klux klansman david duke has raised three times as 
much in large contributions from outside louisiana than inside the 
state in seeking the republican nomination to challenge veteran 
democratic sen bennett johnston but dukes total campaign 
receipts of 138063 are dwarfed by johnstons campaign chest of 
nearly 13 million 
another state where the incumbent senator is stepping down and 
large outofstate contributions are playing a role is new 
hampshire former democratic sen john durkin and republican lawyer 
tom christo have both raised more through 200plus contributions 
outside the state than within in bids for their parties 
nominations to fill the seat being vacated by republican sen 
gordon humphrey

reelection although a congressional ethics committee has yet to 
release a report on questions surrounding his relationship with a 
male prostitute 
the democrat initially said he would make a decision after the 
report was released but in a statement released by his office he 
said the political calendar pushed him to make a decision 
beforehand 
frank who in 1987 became the first member of congress to 
voluntarily disclose being homosexual said the report is not yet 
available and the deadline for nominating petitions is may 8 
no other democrats have announced for the seat the republican 
party has only been able to field two littleknown candidates 
frank 50 who represents the fourth congressional district in 
suburban boston was first elected to his seat in 1980 he has one 
of the most liberal voting records in congress

male prostitute last august it quoted a source as saying that 
frank not only hired a prostitute for sex but was aware that a 
prostitution ring was being run out of his capitol hill apartment 
within days frank identified stephen gobie as the man he hired 
for 80 in 1985 for sex he apologized for poor judgment but 
denied knowing about the prostitution ring he said he fired gobie 
in 1986 after learning of the ring 
on sept 11 the house ethics committee voted to conduct a 
preliminary investigation of frank although frank had formally 
sought the investigation the committee chairman rep julian 
dixon dcalif told reporters that the decision was not based 
on his request but on the panels own initiative 
the hous ethics committee plans to meet thursday in a closed 
session a committee spokeswoman gave no indication whether franks

president bush called for more research to 
sort out the science of global warming tuesday but ran into a 
storm of criticism at an international white house conference from 
europeans who argued for action 
gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide 
inaction declared klaus topfer the west german environmental 
minister 
bush said he hoped the conference attended by delegates from 19 
nations would prod international research and inject economic 
issues into the debate over the greenhouse effect 
the president called for resolving some of the scientific 
uncertainties and economic implications before making a commitment 
to specific pollution controls to deal with possible gradual 
warming of the earth 
environmental policies that ignores the economic factors the 
human factors are destined to fail he said maintaining anew 
that some scientists are in wide disagreement over the impact of 
manmade pollutants on the temperature of the globe 
many of the european participants especially the west germans 
and the dutch said the conference agenda was narrowly arranged to 
prevent open discussions of policy aimed at dealing with global 
warming 
topfer suggested the german delegation would pursue such 
discussions adding the gravity of the situation requires 
immediate determined action 
similar views were expressed by members of other delegations 
including dutch and french officials 
discussions about further research and economic considerations 
should not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide 
stabilization now hans alders the dutch environmental minister 
told the conference during a closed working session 
we needed love canal before hazardous waste was tackled we 
needed a dying river rhine before waste water was treated my 
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on 
global warming now alders told the delegates according to a 
transcript made public by the dutch delegation 
i know theres a debate raging out there bush said in his 
welcoming remarks to the delegates all cabinetlevel ministers 
involved in environmental economic and science issues but he said 
he was confident that more research and examination of economic 
factors before action to curb greenhouse pollutants such as 
carbon dioxide is the way to go 
scientists including bushs own science advisers generally 
agree that manmade pollution especially the release of carbon 
dioxide from burning of fossil fuels is causing heat to be trapped 
and will result in a warming of the globe many say the earths 
temperature could increase by as much as 4 degrees to 9 degrees 
fahrenheit by the middle of the next century causing coastal 
flooding and a shift of weather and agriculture patterns 
environmentalists have urged immediate action by industrial 
countries to curb carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent and many 
of the european countries have called at least for a stabilization 
of such releases by the year 2000 such a commitment would require 
new efforts at energy conservation development of more fuel 
efficient automobiles and more efficient use of energy in homes and 
businesses 
meanwhile us environmentalists accused bush on tuesday of 
abandoning his leadership responsibilities on the global warming 
question by not joining the europeans in a call for firm 
commitments to reduce global warming pollutants 
bush is using the conference as a smoke screen to hide his 
inaction hes using economics as a weapon against environmental 
protection said daniel becker of the sierra club 
rafe pomerance of the world resources institute chided bush 
for suggesting that scientists are at opposite poles on the global 
warming debate he said there is widespread agreement that the 
earth will become warmer if pollution curbs are not put into effect 
at a luncheon address to the conference william reilly head of 
the environmental protection agency maintained the bush 
administration has taken actions to combat global warming 
he cited the push to phase out chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
which are another major cause of global warming a call by bush to 
plant 1 billion trees a year and efforts to toughen federal air 
pollution laws as well as a 1 billion global change research 
effort 
but environmentalists maintained the tree planting effort will 
have scant effect on overall carbon dioxide pollution and that the 
administration vigorously fought efforts in congress to require 
automakers to develop more fuel efficient cars which would have 
allowed for significant carbon dioxide reductions by the end of the 
decade federal money to foster energy efficiency and renewable 
fuels also remains below the levels of a decade ago they said

the rocky flats weapons plant stored hazardous 
waste illegally for a decade by claiming it was being saved for 
recycling a federal judge has ruled apparently making the plant 
subject to state regulations 
this takes a big step toward making clear what they can and 
cannot store and what is and is not hazardous waste said maggie 
fox of the sierra club which sued the us department of energy 
over storage of the material at the plant 
the ruling by us district judge lewis t babcock which was 
issued thursday but did not become publicly known until monday 
does not call for fines or other penalties 
but it apparently will force the plant to meet state 
hazardouswaste regulations on storage of ash and other residue 
left over from waste incineration 
the plant shut down its incinerator last year as part of the 
lawsuit but for years it had burned waste tainted with radioactive 
plutonium 
plant operators had argued that the resulting ash was exempt 
from state regulation because the plant was storing the material 
for recycling of the plutonium it contained 
court records showed that plutonium actually was recovered from 
less than 10 percent of the tons of residue stored 
triggers for nuclear weapons were assembled at the plant but 
most of the plants plutoniumrelated operations have been shut 
down since late last year partly for a seasonal inventory and 
partly because of technical problems 
energy department attorneys argued that any ruling designating 
the residue as regulated waste would jeopardize an agreement with 
the state over the handling storage and generation of hazardous 
waste at the plant 
john haggard rocky flats program coordinator of the colorado 
department of health said the ruling strengthens the states 
authority to regulate the waste

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan is recommending a 99 percent increase in medicare 
payments to physicians for the 1991 fiscal year his office said 
tuesday 
the recommendation to congress is a realistic goal for 
physicians one consistent with both the prudent practice of 
medicine and the necessary restraint on cost increases sullivan 
said 
medicare payments to physicians have been growing by 12 percent 
a year in recent years about double the rate of inflation 
under legislation passed by congress last year the secretary 
must recommend annually a medicare physician payment target 
congress is to review the recommendation and set a medicare volume 
performance standard if congress does not act the law provides 
for the performance standard to be determined based on a specified 
formula 
the new law changes the way medicare pays physicians by 
realigning reimbursement rates increasing them for family and 
internal physicians and reducing them for surgeons and other 
specialized physicians 
the performance standard will be the main factor used to 
determine future annual medicare fee increases to physicians the 
new system of physician payments will be phased in beginning in 
january 1992 
in recommending a physician payment goal the secretary takes 
into account such things as general inflation the increase in the 
number of medicare beneficiaries and changes in technology 
the 99 percent overall rates of increase includes an 87 
percent growth rate for surgical services and 105 percent growth 
rate for all other physician services

the san francisco water department citing 
low reservoirs called for mandatory water rationing to cut use by 
25 percent for its 22 million customers 
the departments recommendation monday proposes the same formula 
used during the 1988 drought year based on 1987 usage 
anybody who was in the program last time will be getting the 
same allotment said john mullane acting director of the 
department 
the recommendation heads to the public utilities commission next 
week if approved rationing probably would begin may 1 according 
to mullane 
mullane who noted reservoirs are only at 38 percent of 
capacity said rationing is necessary to guarantee enough water to 
get through another dry winter 
supplies also will be cut by 25 percent for the 32 suburban 
agencies in san mateo santa clara and alameda counties that buy 
water from san francisco however those agencies have the option 
of creating their own rationing plan 
the santa clara valley water district adopted mandatory 
rationing that began on april 1 the east bay municipal utility 
district has turned to voluntary conservation

president bush defended the practice of 
appointing an american general as supreme commander of nato saying 
it underscores the important role the united states plays in 
preserving peace in europe 
on another european issue bush said he had given no thought to 
dealing with a possible labor government in great britain he 
shrugged off polls that indicate british voters have turned against 
prime minister margaret thatcher and her conservative government 
bush was interviewed monday by four correspondents from 
newspapers in france great britain and canada the white house 
released the transcript tuesday 
bush who will consult thursday with french president francois 
mitterrand in key largo fla was asked if he could envision a 
french supreme commander of nato although france belongs to the 
16nation alliance it does not participate in its integrated 
military structure 
were very happy with the present arrangements bush 
replied i dont want to have this coming out in a chauvinistic 
sense but i think the american people have to feel the 
american presence is wanted 
keeping an american in charge of natos military command 
contributes to the view that we have an important role to play 
and the europeans want us to have an important role to play bush 
said 
ive given no thought to any substantive change in all of 
this but if anybody has a different view id be willing to hear 
it 
bush who last week conferred with canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney in toronto and with mrs thatcher in bermuda said he was 
meeting with mitterrand in part to narrow any differences that 
might exist between france and the united states on the future of 
nato 
it is my conviction that nato will have a perhaps even more 
important role to play in the stability of europe bush said 
mitterrand has a keen interest in a role for the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe a 35nation forum spanning 
both nato and the warsaw pact bush said but he added i know 
were not egregiously apart at all 
bush sought to brush aside questions about whether he could deal 
with britains labor party if it ousts the thatcher government 
i dont want to get into the bubbling cauldron of domestic 
politics inside the uk right now bush said 
he said he had not given any thought to dealing with the 
labor party 
we do have a special relationship with britain and itll 
continue im sure regardless of who occupies 10 downing street 
he said 
he dismissed mrs thatchers low standing in polls citing his 
own low ratings early in the 1988 campaign and the recent polling 
fiasco that indicated daniel ortega would win nicaraguas 
presidential election 
im enough of a politician to know that people can be down one 
moment and then soaring like an eagle the next bush said 
he called mrs thatcher a very courageous principled leader 
who fights for her beliefs and has survived many ups and downs 
bush refused to express an opinion on quebecs separatist 
movement saying he would courageously sit on the sidelines on 
that question 
the united states he said should not involve itself in the 
internal affairs of canada

there will be an adequate supply of physicians 
and most other health professionals through the end of the century 
but the shortage of nurses is expected to worsen the government 
said tuesday 
the number of registered nurses has grown from 750000 in 1970 
to more than 16 million in 1988 according to a report sent to 
congress by health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
however even though the number is expected to continue to 
increase over the next 15 years it will not be enough to alleviate 
the shortages the report said 
public health experts say the nursing shortage has been caused 
in part because of population growth and because hospital patients 
tend to be sicker these days and need more intensive care 
in many other health professions the supply is growing but the 
rate of growth is expected to slow between 2000 and 2020 because 
the number of people leaving the workforce will be greater than the 
number entering the report said 
minorities it said are underrepresented in health professions 
black and hispanic physicians make up 3 percent each of the 
total number of doctors although blacks constitute 12 percent of 
the total us population and hispanics 7 percent the report said 
sullivan pointed to newark nj as an example of the 
geographic maldistribution of health professionals 
in that city he said there are three times as many 
officebased primarycare physicians per 100000 people in 
nonpoverty areas as in poverty areas

president bush praised honduras today for a 
productive role in bringing about a peace agreement in 
nicaragua and voiced strong us support for helping to demobilize 
and resettle contra rebels 
administration officials have been waging a heavy lobbying 
campaign to get congress to act on the presidents 800 million aid 
package for central america calling further delay an affront to 
us allies in the region 
bush speaking after a white house meeting with honduran 
president rafael l callejas called the honduran government an 
inspiring example of the democratic promise that today is spreading 
throughout the americas 
the united states applauds honduras productive role in 
achieving a multilateral agreement on the peaceful demobilization 
and repatriation of the nicaraguan resistance in conditions of 
safety for all concerned bush said it was a reference to the 
peace process that ended the war between the usbacked contras 
and the marxist sandinista government 
callejas calling the 1980s a complicated decade for central 
america said that the present decade must be one of economic 
rebuilding 
it is impossible to have democracy without economic 
development he said speaking after bush during a departure 
ceremony outside the white house 
both bush and callejas praised an economic package being put 
together by the united states japan and international lending 
organizations to help honduras refinance some of its huge 
international debt 
the meeting came at a time when the administration has been 
turning up the heat on congress to pass its aid package for 
nicaragua and panama 
administration officials say that stalling the aid package 
beyond the april 25 inauguration of usbacked nicaraguan 
presidentelect violeta chamorro would be a foreign policy 
embarrassment 
it also would be a burden on the government of honduras a 
longtime us ally the officials say many of the contra rebels 
the united states hopes to resettle remain in camps in honduras 
also on the agenda at todays bushcallejas meeting was the 
status of efforts by the world bank the international monetary 
fund the united states and japan to help honduras ease its large 
international debt 
addressing a white house audience on latin american issues 
monday bush said congress which returns from its easterpassover 
recess on wednesday was wrong to not provide the funds before the 
break 
i have pledged to mrs chamorro that the united states 
government would respond in nicaraguas hour of need the 
president said 
i believe the united states of america has a great deal at 
stake in the success of violeta chamorro but more so in democracy 
itself in nicaragua he added 
a senior administration official briefing reporters at the 
white house on the condition of anonymity said it would be a 
very unfortunate message for the congress to send to mrs chamorro 
not to have this on the presidents desk by her inauguration 
time is wasting to cut this package and reduce it supposedly 
to help some other part of the world would be a historic mistake 
the official said 
the administrations package bogged down in congress calls for 
500 million for panama and 300 million for nicaragua 
the house increased the package to 24 billion adding money 
for us projects including food stamps disaster relief fighting 
forest fires and veterans programs the senate has yet to act on 
the legislation 
many members have called for expanding the package to include 
more aid for emerging eastern european democracies 
the administration said last week that it would rechannel about 
36 million in already appropriated funds to help a joint united 
nationsorganization of american states team begin demobilizing 
contra rebels now encamped in honduras 
however the senior administration official said there are 
some 45000 family members of the resistance who will remain in 
honduras as refugees they want to go home 
bushs 300 million request for nicaragua includes 47 million 
for resettling contra fighters and families now in honduras 
if that money is not available the ability of the central 
americans and mrs chamorro to help this process move along is 
going to be crippled it would burden honduras with a burden it 
should not have at this time theyve been very patient for many 
years the official said

pakistan india brazil argentina and iraq 
have been able to build or expand nuclear weapons capabilities by 
smuggling materials from supplier countries according to a private 
study released tuesday 
to counter these activities the report recommends that the 
united states and other suppliers threaten military and economic 
sanctions against countries engaging in such operations 
titled nuclear exports the challenge of control the report 
was prepared by the carnegie endowment for international peace a 
private research group it was written by leonard spector a 
veteran expert on nuclear proliferation with assistance from 
jacqueline smith 
the report said west germany has been the weak link in the 
international export control system and must tighten its export 
laws both india and pakistan have relied on west german suppliers 
for their nuclear programs the report said 
shortly before the report was released the new head of brazils 
nuclear energy commission jose luis de carvalho santana said 
brazil will not build a nuclear bomb but he declined to say 
whether it had the technical ability to do so 
argentina has repeatedly proclaimed the right to develop and 
explode a nuclear device even though experts claim it seems far 
from being able to achieve that goal 
three weeks ago iraq denied any intention of developing nuclear 
weapons and reaffirmed that denial on monday it said devices 
described by us prosecutors as nuclear warhead detonation 
capacitors allegedly being smuggled to baghdad were to be used in a 
nonnuclear university laser project 
in midmarch british investigators arrested four people they 
claimed had tried to smuggle these devices to iraq 
president saddam hussein has expressed concern in recent days 
about a possible nuclear attack by israel against his country the 
report lists israel among countries where there is a 
proliferation concern 
of the five countries the report focuses on it said iraqs 
program was far behind those of the other four 
the report said in some instances agents of the five countries 
have engaged in simple smuggling for example by attempting to 
export commodities without required export licenses or by making 
blatantly false declarations on export documents 
in other cases it said these agents have been able to minimize 
any suspect characteristics of the commodities at issue taking 
advantage of a relaxed attitude by licensing officials or 
exploiting gaps in export regulations 
if controls had been enforced effectively spector said it is 
possible pakistan would not be able to manufacture nuclear 
weapons today that indias nuclear weapons potential would be a 
fraction of its current size and that neither argentina nor brazil 
would have facilities capable of producing nuclear weapons 
material 
supplier countries should retaliate against nuclear smuggling by 
threatening reduced aid military sales restrictions or economic 
sanctions the report said 
it recommended that traditional nuclear suppliers ensure 
rigorous enforcement of their common nuclear export guidelines 
prosecuting individuals involved in nuclear smuggling while 
essential neither reaches the source of the problem nor imposes 
unacceptable costs on nations that seek to undermine the 
international nuclear control regime the study said 
indeed many of these states continue to enjoy the fruits of 
their illicit nuclear purchasing operations even after they have 
been exposed it said 
other recommendations included 
finding ways to recover illicitly acquired nuclear commodities 
or to ensure that they do not contribute to nuclear weapons 
programs 
publicizing nuclear smuggling operations more frequently the 
embarrassment of publicity serves at least as a mild sanction 
against states engaged in such operations and also serves to 
chastise the commercial firms that aid them the report said

a federal judge on tuesday acquitted a former state 
democratic party chairman on charges he participated in a scheme to 
bribe dominican republic officials to release seized drug planes 
the case against alfredo duran went awry in the past month after 
a codefendant was revealed to be a drug enforcement administration 
informant and a chief prosecution witness turned out to be a 
lawyer who failed to inform clients he was secretly cooperating 
with federal investigators 
democratic officials at the time of the november indictment 
called it a political vendetta by us attorney dexter lehtinen a 
former republican state senator whose wife is a republican 
congresswoman 
on tuesday before the defense was to present its case us 
district judge james kehoe ordered duran acquitted saying the 
government had failed to prove the charges against him were a crime 
under the foreign corrupt practices act 
i feel that i have been thoroughly vindicated said duran 
53 who could have faced a maximum five years in prison if 
convicted he was state party chairman during 197680 
his lawyer donald bierman played down any political angle in 
the case 
i think that it was a very poorly thought out prosecution but 
i dont personally believe it was political said bierman 
the judge refused a government request to stay the acquittal 
while prosecutors appealed and bierman said the judges decision 
in such cases is final 
diane cossin spokeswoman for lehtinen denied any political 
motivation behind durans indictment she said of the verdict we 
are disappointed but we have every faith in the criminal justice 
system 
the indictment had charged that duran took money from attorney 
jose insua and codefendant robert gurin and was to pass it to 
retired dominican gen joaquin pou who would see that government 
officials there released the planes 
gurin pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government and 
pous aide jose guasch also later pleaded guilty to one count of 
conspiring to break the corrupt practices act 
but pou jumped bond fleeing to his homeland and telling the 
media there he was a dea informant who was betrayed by the us 
government 
last week the judge agreed with the defense that all evidence 
concerning pou should be excluded from the case crippling the 
prosecution 
insua in turn was attacked by the defense because he set up a 
sting operation against duran and pou after becoming involved in 
another criminal investigation attorneys said that was an ethical 
violation by both insua and the us attorneys office because the 
lawyers clients were never informed their attorney was working 
with prosecutors 
with much of the evidence excluded kehoe ruled that there was 
no evidence the money had left the united states as required under 
the 1977 law and ordered the acquittal

the justice department on tuesday sought 
records of 754 us bank accounts where it said colombias medellin 
cartel has stashed 400 million from cocaine sales on american 
streets 
the action marks the first time thaassociated presst federal authorities 
traced 
dollar for dollar drug money from us street sales that was 
laundered through foreign accounts and returned to american banks 
officials said 
the department asked federal judges in atlanta miami and new 
york to order 173 banks in 22 states and the nations capital to 
turn over the records that officials said could yield a wealth of 
financial information about the cartel 
federal prosecutors also asked an atlanta judge to freeze 684 
accounts linked to eduardo martinez romero who was extradited in 
september to face charges he laundered drug money for the cartel 
the legal action is likely to produce more information than 
money but should help investigators continue thenazi death camps 
of course we know the pictures from home but it has a 
different meaning here said cellist alexander wedow 56 who has 
been with the orchestra for 28 years 
it goes very deep into your soul it is a deep sadness said 
oboe player hansjoerg schellenberger 42 this can always happen 
again mankind has this black part in its soul 
some musicians said they had been somewhat apprehensive about 
audience reaction before their first concert and that they were 
overwhelmed by the standing ovations after each performance 
among those cheering were several elderly germanborn israelis 
who are often torn between pride in the culture of their youth and 
hatred of the nazis who uprooted them and killed their families 
alfred frankenstein 84 who fled berlin in 1935 said the 
sounds of schubert and brahms brought back the days when he covered 
the orchestra as a music critic 
an old man likes to relive the beautiful moments of his youth 
and this was one of them the faces of the musicians have 
changed but the berlin philharmonic remains one of the best 
orchestras said frankenstein 
the warm welcome is the latest sign that while the holocaust 
still shapes israeli attitudes there is less sensitivity about old 
taboos in part because a new israeli generation has emerged with 
no direct experience of nazi rule 
earlier this year gottfried wagner the greatgrandson of 19th 
century german composer richard wagner toured israel to push for 
the lifting of a boycott on the music of wagner 
he won support from israels music establishment and ron said 
barenboim was trying to put together a wagner concert with the 
israel philharmonic this fall orchestra officials said they were 
unaware of any such efforts

the ouster of a curator at the small 
but innovative berkshire museum has set off a furor with one donor 
changing his mind about donating 2 million and his photograph 
collection 
i am appalled that the museum could cut a curator so sympatico 
to the arts connecticut collector george r rinhart said of the 
dismissal of art curator debra balken 
rinhart owns one of the largest private collections of american 
photographs it includes more than a million prints dating from the 
1830s to the 1960s including civil war scenes by matthew brady 
along with a reference library of at least 20000 volumes 
museum director barry dressel said monday that rinharts threat 
wasnt as dire as it seemed because he never had received any 
written guarantees that the bequests were final 
basically we have only the word from a donor that when he 
dies in 30 years he is going to leave this collection and an 
endowment to the museum said dressel 
would we love to have that collection sure but it was a 
conclusion of the trustees and me that basically there was little 
to assume he said 
however others have said they also have changed their minds 
about donations to the museum 
balken could not be reached for comment she is not listed in 
directory information she declined comment earlier to the 
newspaper 
balken who came to the berkshire museum in 1981 has been 
praised for bringing exciting exhibitions to the museum and for her 
expertise in the field of modern and contemporary art but she also 
has been criticized for exhibitions that werent received well by 
some sections of the community 
last week museum officials announced that balkens job had been 
consolidated in an administrative restructuring trustees said 
the museum will create an administrative post of director of 
curatorial programs and will contract with guest curators for 
individual exhibits 
the decision was made by dressel and approved unanimously by the 
11 trustees present 
rinhart was not at home tuesday and not available for additional 
comment 
he told the berkshire eagle last week he had changed his mind 
about his intended gifts including an endowment that could have 
provided 100000 annual income 
i only came out of my turtle shell because of the outrage i 
feel about the way debra was treated he said a sensitive 
intelligent human being is being treated as an ornament no longer 
in vogue 
in the wake of the museum changes a donor has canceled plans to 
donate three paintings by 19th century landscape painter george 
innes 
and ellsworth kelly of spencertown ny who has donated work 
to the museum said he will not give any more 
george heard hamilton professor emeritus of art at williams 
college and former director of the sterling and francine clark art 
institute resigned from the berkshire museums collections 
committee on account of the ouster of balken 
dressel said the reaction hasnt shaken trustees conviction 
they needed to replace balken 
weve had virtually no cancellation of membership our funders 
are not unhappy dressel said the museum is certainly not 
rocked or sinking by this change

consumer prices fueled by sharp increases in 
clothing housing and medical costs shot up 05 percent in march 
to push inflation to the highest level since 1982 the government 
said tuesday 
private economists saw the unexpectedly brisk advance in the 
labor departments consumer price index as a discouraging sign that 
inflation was not retreating as they had hoped 
the inflation rate is dangerous and potentially devastating 
for financial markets and the economy said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
through the first three months of the year inflation has risen 
at an annual rate of 85 percent the fastest quarterly increase 
since a 101 percent increase in the spring of 1982 
part of the surge earlier in the year was attributed to an 
unusually cold december that froze crops along the gulf coast and 
sent fuel oil prices skyward but march declines in energy and 
fruit and vegetable prices were not enough to offset widespread 
increases elsewhere 
the march figures are a reminder that inflation is a chronic 
problem that its not going away and its not getting better 
said cynthia latta an economist at drimcgraw hill 
while inflation is still expected to slow in coming months the 
march figure sent some economists scurrying to revise upward their 
forecast for the entire year some said consumer prices could rise 
by 5 percent for all of 1990 that would be up from a 46 percent 
increase in 1989 and the highest annual rate since 1981 
the bad news on inflation had a negative impact on financial 
markets pushing the yields on bond prices up as investors demanded 
more insurance against inflation threats stock prices retreated 
but recovered somewhat later in the day 
in another economic report tuesday the government said 
industrial production rose 07 percent in march reflecting a 
rebound in auto production it was the second consecutive strong 
showing and provided evidence some analysts said that the slump 
in american manufacturing may finally be coming to an end 
in a third report the commerce department said that housing 
construction fell for the second consecutive month declining by 
93 percent as new homes and apartments were being built at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 132 million units in march 
analysts predicted the 05 percent inflation rate in march 
which followed an equal gain of 05 percent in february and a 11 
percent increase in january would strengthen the federal 
reserves resolve not to lower interest rates despite pressures 
from the bush administration 
in fact sinai said that if inflation does not slow soon the 
federal reserve might even begin pushing interest rates upward 
something it has not done for over a year in an effort to dampen 
price pressures 
the message is that it may take more pain more restraint on 
the economy to get inflation down to acceptable levels he said 
over twothirds of the march inflation came from rising housing 
and clothing prices 
housing costs rose by 05 percent the biggest advance since 
januarys 07 percent 
clothing costs which climbed a record 33 percent in february 
rose 16 percent last month as the impact of sharply higher costs 
for new spring lines continued to be felt 
so far this year clothing prices are up at an annual rate of 
214 percent compared to an increase of just 1 percent for all of 
1989 
medical costs jumped 08 percent last month and have risen 86 
percent over the past year the biggest increase of all the major 
categories 
energy prices were down during the month dropping by 08 
percent pushed lower by a 14 percent drop in gasoline pump prices 
and another big drop in home heating oil costs which continued to 
retreat after a big spike in january 
food prices rose 04 percent during the month slightly less 
than the 05 percent increase in february as a big drop in fruit 
and vegetable prices offset increases in other areas 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy areas were up 
sharply as well in march climbing 07 percent the fastest since a 
08 percent rise in december economists believe this core rate is 
a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures 
the various changes left the consumer price index at 1287 
before seasonal adjustments that meant that a hypothetical 
selection of goods and services costing 100 in the 198284 base 
period would have cost 12870 last month up from 12250 a year 
ago

abernathy died at crawford long hospital which he entered three 
weeks ago for an electrolytic imbalance hospital officials said 
his heart stopped during a lung scan and he died while in an 
operating room they would not say what surgery abernathy might 
have been undergoing 
abernathy was president emeritus of the southern christian 
leadership conference and pastor of atlantas west hunter street 
baptist church 
he caused a controversy last year when he wrote in his 
autobiography that king dallied with two women and later fought 
with a third he had spurned on the night and morning before his 
1968 assassination 
kings family and many of his colleagues condemned abernathy 
following the books publication but tuesday kings son a 
visibly saddened fulton county commissioner martin luther king iii 
called abernathys death certainly a very tragic loss to our 
nation 
the rev joseph lowery who succeeded abernathy as president of 
the sclc today called abernathy a faithful servant of the cause 
of liberty and justice 
lowery said he regretted the allegations against king in 
abernathys book nevertheless his record still stands as a 
stalwart steward in this movement 
abernathy born march 11 1926 in linden ala worked in the 
civil rights movement from its inception in 1955 he stood at 
kings side through the great battles of the movement and went to 
jail as often as king did but abernathy consistently found himself 
in kings shadow 
in his autobiography and the walls came tumbling down 
abernathy said he felt other king aides saw him as no more than 
an appendage to martin someone who served as a part companion 
part bodyguard but who never played an important role in the 
decisions that affected the direction of the movement 
abernathy mentioned in his autobiography that king dallied with 
various women on april 3 1968 his last night alive he became the 
first of the civil rights inner circle to openly discuss kings 
alleged marital infidelities which had been chronicled by several 
noted biographers 
that revelation drew the ire of black leaders who asked 
abernathy to retract the passages dealing with kings alleged 
infidelity and insinuated that abernathys memory had been impaired 
by two strokes and brain surgery 
the book controversy tore a hole in the already fragile 
relationship abernathy had with his movement colleagues a 
relationship that had been rather cool since abernathys 1980 
endorsement of ronald reagan for president abernathy supported 
jesse jackson another former king aide for president in 1988 
abernathy and king led the montgomery ala bus boycott in 
1955 which launched the civil rights movement in 1957 the pair 
founded the sclc and abernathy was kings confidant counselor and 
cellmate during the turbulent years before king was shot to death 
in memphis tenn 
it was abernathy who cradled kings bloody head april 4 1968 
as he lay dying of a bullet wound on the balcony of the lorraine 
motel he took care of various funeral details for kings widow 
coretta scott king and delivered the eulogy at his best friends 
funeral 
abernathy said he had no desire to lead the civil rights 
movement preferring to leave that role to the more charismatic 
king but two days after kings death abernathy was sclc 
president leading the poor peoples campaign a mass demonstration 
held in washington in the summer of 1968 
abernathy was sclc president for nine years as the focus of the 
civil rights movement shifted from voting rights and civil rights 
to such economic issues as full employment and antipoverty 
programs 
he resigned from the sclc in 1977 saying he wanted to devote 
his time to a campaign for congress he was defeated in the 
democratic primary 
concentrating on preaching and lecturing abernathy also held 
the title of president with honors of the world peace conference 
headquartered in helsinki finland and he traveled around the 
world three times on peace missions 
he suffered a stroke in 1983 and underwent brain bypass surgery 
at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore after he recovered he 
returned to preach at west hunter street baptist church where he 
had been pastor since 1961 
at a 1985 dinner he was praised by other civil rights leaders 
as an unsung hero of their movement in 1989 he was handed a 
telegram signed by most of his movement contemporaries which said 
the accounts about king in his autobiography could rob you of 
your rightful place in history 
despite the controversy abernathy stood by his account as true 
im not judas he said i know who i am 
abernathy is survived by his wife juanita two sons kwame and 
state rep ralph david abernathy iii and two daughters juandalynn 
and donzaleigh

rep barney frank whose personal and political 
life was rocked last year by disclosure of his relationship with a 
male prostitute announced tuesday he will seek reelection 
the democrat had intended to wait until the house ethics 
committee released a report about questions surrounding his 
involvement with prostitute stephen gobie but said the election 
calendar pushed him to act sooner 
frank must file nominating petitions by may 8 
people may decide to run or not run based on what i do so i 
thought it was only fair to let people know that frank said 
frank 50 said he also concluded his effectiveness as a 
congressmen had not been hurt by the relationship with gobie that 
he said ended in 1986 
the relationship which included frank hiring gobie as a 
personal aide after paying him for sex was revealed in august by 
the washington times 
the story also quoted sources as saying frank was aware gobie 
ran a prostitution ring from his washington apartment an 
allegation frank has vigorously denied 
i did some things that were dumb i was also accused of some 
things that werent true i had to figure out whether the 
combination of that was going to damage my effectiveness frank 
said obviously my judgment is that it has not 
frank who in 1987 became the first member of congress to 
voluntarily disclose being homosexual said his major concern was 
how his congressional colleagues viewed him and his ability to 
continue with the job 
my sense is none of them think i deserve a nobel prize for 
judgment for what i did five years ago but i think they have given 
me a chance to establish what did and didnt happen frank said 
based on that i dont think my ability to fight for the things i 
care about has been damaged 
alexander tennant executive director of the massachusetts 
republican party accused frank of breaking his word by announcing 
for reelection before the ethics committee reported 
he is just disregarding a commitment he made to the public 
tennant said it was all a charade he had every intention of

the nuclear regulatory commission must set up 
training requirements for nuclear power plant workers a federal 
appeals court said tuesday 
the us circuit court of appeals said the nrc had circumvented 
a 1983 change in the nuclear waste policy act the nrc issued a 
policy statement in 1985 that encourages but does not compel 
nuclear plant operators to create training programs 
the nrc concluded that the best way to get civilian nuclear 
power plants to improve training was to create a model training 
code and urge utilities to voluntarily comply 
the nrc ended up endorsing industrywritten training procedures 
and utility companies with nuclear power plants are successfully 
meeting those standards said angie howard of the institute of 
nuclear power operations an industry group 
public citizen a group founded by ralph nader filed lawsuits 
in 1986 and 1988 challenging the nrcs approach 
the nrc looked again at the training issue in 1988 and decided 
not to impose requirements relying on language in the amendment 
that allows the agency to issue appropriate regulatory 
guidance 
the term regulatory guidance is ambiguous but the language 
mandating the instructional requirements is clear and controls the 
issue chief judge patricia wald wrote 
whatever the commissions regulatory guidance is it must 
establish instructional requirements and nonmandatory suggestions 
fail to do this she wrote in the 30 decision when congress 
gives an agency its marching orders the agency must obey all of 
them not merely some 
wald noted that a presidential panel examining the accident at 
three mile island said inadequate training contributed 
significantly to the risks posed by nuclear power plants 
the nrc and utilities argued that imposing mandatory 
requirements would make the nuclear power industry less safe 
because it would choke off the industrys selfregulatory efforts 
companies could regard the nrcs requirements as a maximum rather 
than a minimum level of appropriate training the agency said 
the nrc and the industry must take this argument to the 
congress not to the courts said the appeals panel 
voluntary industry training was under way when congress passed 
the law and the nrcs model training code is exactly what 
congress did not want to perpetuate said david vladeck an 
attorney for the public citizen litigation group 
in the nrcs inspections of specific sites we have had 
concerns about the effectiveness of training said susan shankman 
of the federal agencys office of nuclear reactor regulation 
monitoring is continuing 
the training programs in place now are superb and the court 
ruling probably wont have an impact on them said joe colvin 
executive vice president and chief operating officer of the nuclear 
management and resources council a utility industry group 
i cant argue that there wont be any increased enforcement 
action by the nrc as a result of the court case but we dont 
view that as a major problem said colvin

benjamin franklin died 200 years ago tuesday and 
according to his will that means its now time to spend the 1000 
pounds sterling he bequeathed to massachusetts and pennsylvania 
the pennies saved are now worth about 45 million and requests 
for a cut are pouring in from as far away as london 
franklin died in philadelphia on april 17 1790 at age 84 in 
his will he gave 1000 pounds sterling to massachusetts and the 
city of boston and an equal sum to the state of pennsylvania and 
the city of philadelphia the dollar did not become the official 
us currency until 1792 
the money came from what franklin earned during his tenure as 
president of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 178587 he believed 
that politicians should not be paid for serving the public 
franklin specified in his will that on the 100th anniversary of 
his death a part of the two trusts be used for training young 
people but at that time several interested parties sued for access 
to the money 
a massachusetts court resolved the dispute there by setting up a 
board of managers to control the money until the 200th anniversary 
the managers ultimately decided to build a technical school the 
franklin institute in boston 
a similar arrangement in pennsylvania benefited the franklin 
institute in philadelphia a science museum 
the massachusetts group did considerably better in investing its 
share with the fund now worth about 45 million pennsylvanias 
1000 pounds is now worth 2 million 
because franklins trust was not set up for more than a year 
after he died current litigation seeks to put a date on when the 
money will be released to the cities and states officials 
estimated it would be 1991 before the recipients see their share 
then comes the question of what to do with the money 
in keeping with franklins legacy wed like to use the fund to 
help the young people of boston with job training for their 
careers this way were investing in the future of boston said 
bob consalvo boston mayor raymond flynns operations manager 
philadelphia mayor w wilson goode issued a statement citing 
franklins hope that the money aid students he said the money 
should go to city high school students or recent graduates who need 
financial aid especially in pursuit of a trade 
susan kaplan a spokeswoman for gov michael dukakis said 
massachusetts plan for the trust had not been determined 
pennsylvania gov robert p caseys office also said there were 
no firm plans for that states share 
consalvo said requests for money from the fund have come from as 
far away as london where a group called friends of the franklin 
house want 15 million to renovate the early americans home there 
another bid for the funds has come from bostons franklin 
institute which gives financial aid and technical training to 
boston youth 
we feel franklins memory would be better served if the trust 
would be used for the institute said richard p donofrio vice 
president of the institute thats our cry continue the 
legacy 
in pennsylvania rod snyder a spokesman for the governors 
budget office said philadelphias franklin institute would be the 
likely recipient of the money although some legislators there have 
suggested it be used to promote the arts 
it also has been suggested that boston use the funds to combat 
the rising crime rates among young people 
it will fit in nicely with the citys safe neighborhoods plan 
we believe that through good jobs and careers you can replace the 
drugs and violence that influence our youth consalvo said

a mostly invisible sculpture that its 
creator says suggests the idea of free space has been chosen to 
commemorate the free speech movement of the 1960s 
the winning design picked in a nationwide contest consists of 
a 6inch circular patch of earth that sits within a 6foot granite 
ring the viewer is asked to visualize concentric columns of air 
rising from the circles 
along the low granite ring which will be several inches wide 
an inscription will read this soil and the air space extending 
above it shall not be a part of any nation and shall not be subject 
to any entitys jurisdiction 
the winning artist mark a brest van kempen was announced 
monday by peter selz professor emeritus of art history at the 
university of california at berkeley and chairman of the berkeley 
art project a group of about 100 faculty members that sponsored 
the search 
the free speech movement was born on the ucberkeley campus in 
1964 
brest van kempen a 28yearold graduate student at the san 
francisco art institute described his mostly invisible design as 
apolitical and said his idea was to dedicate the free space 
to the right of all humans to speak freely 
he plans to devote more than half the 70000 prize money toward 
getting special legislation to declare the space free of national 
boundaries 
brest van kempens work is to be displayed on the campus sproul 
plaza pending approval from the university which remains 
uncertain 
in a letter in january ucberkeley chancellor ira michael 
heyman expressed misgivings about honoring the free speech 
movement saying it had been viewed by many in the community with 
negative or mixed emotions 
the movement challenged the universitys rules against political 
activity on campus the demonstrations sparked a wave of protests 
that made armed camps of the nations colleges before the 1960s 
were over 
veterans of the movement along with ucberkeley faculty and 
students and representatives of the city chose the winner from 
among five finalists

the nations industrial production gained 07 
percent in march the government said tuesday in a second 
consecutive strong showing that led analysts to suggest the 
manufacturing recession may have ended 
we may have been through the worst of the slowdown said 
thomas runiewicz an industrial analyst with the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa i think youll hear less talk of recession from the 
pessimists for a while 
marchs advance followed an even stronger 08 percent increase a 
month earlier both gains reflected increases in the output of 
automobiles the federal reserve reported 
the other major contributor to the overall production increase 
in march was utility output which increased markedly as 
temperatures were more normal after an unseasonably warm january 
and february the fed said elsewhere production was little 
changed on balance in march 
production had plummeted 13 percent in january because of the 
effect of the weather on utility output and of layoffs in the 
automobile industry as automakers trimmed bloated inventories 
the suggestion is that the bottom has been reached in the 
industrial sector weakness and the issue raised is whether in 
light of such high inflation the industrial sector now may be too 
strong remarked allen sinai chief economist for the boston co 
in another report tuesday the labor department said consumer 
prices jumped 05 percent in march pushing the inflation rate for 
the first three months of 1990 to its highest level in almost eight 
years 
evelina tainer senior economist for first national bank of 
chicago also said she believes the slowdown in manufacturing 
reached bottom in the fourth quarter of 1989 but added the 
industrial sector still is not showing particular strength 
industrial production at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods rose 03 percent in march on top of a 
11 percent gain a month earlier 
durable manufacturing was up 09 percent after jumping 17 
percent in february nondurable manufacturing was down 04 percent 
in march after inching up 02 percent a month earlier 
output at mines rose 06 percent last month after dropping 16 
percent in february reflecting the return to relatively normal 
weather utility output jumped 61 percent in march after falling 
12 percent in february 
the fed said the operating rate of the nations factories mines 
and utilities which usually move in tandem with industrial 
production advanced 04 percentage point to 833 percent last 
month the operating rate measures not only output but also changes 
in productivity levels

the united states criticized malaysia on 
tuesday for turning away vietnamese boat people saying the policy 
was responsible for the death of four people 
the united states has vigorously protested the denial of first 
asylum to vietnamese at all appropriate levels of the malaysian 
government said state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
malaysia and other south asian countries agreed last summer to 
grant asylum to vietnamese fleeing their homeland under the 
agreement those arriving before march 14 1989 would be screened 
to determine which were entitled to refugee status and which were 
economic migrants 
malaysia denies it has turned away vietnamese but says it is 
worried about being stuck with migrants who are not accepted by the 
united states and other western countries as refugees 
the united nations high commissioner for refugees has reported 
that at least 4000 asylum seekers from vietnam arrived in 
indonesia after being redirected by malaysian authorities 
tutwiler said 
we are deeply distressed that four vietnamese have perished as 
a result of malaysian actions she said

discoverys launch next week with 
the hubble space telescope may be moved up a day if a new power 
unit tests well and the change doesnt hamper preparations for the 
next shuttle mission nasa said tuesday 
the second attempt to launch discovery is scheduled for april 
25 15 days after the first attempt was scrubbed because of a 
faulty auxiliary power unit 
the national aeronautics and space administration said the delay 
has pushed back the launch of space shuttle columbia to at least 
midmay columbia originally was scheduled to lift off may 9 on a 
nineday mission to scan space with a 100 million observatory 
called astro 
nasa said it will wait until after discovery is launched with 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope the agencys most valuable 
payload before setting a new target date for columbia 
were required to inspect the hardware of the previous mission 
before we fly the next one said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
for now she said things are going well were not tracking 
any serious problems on either of them 
hubble will not be at risk inside discoverys sealed payload bay 
when the new power unit is fired up for five minutes wednesday 
said nasa spokesman george diller 
the unit is one of three that pressurize the shuttles hydraulic 
system which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the 
ships braking and steering systems each apu must work properly 
before a shuttle can be launched 
contamination sensors removed from the cargo bay over the 
weekend showed no evidence of additional dust or debris on the 
telescopes 94inch mirror the finest ever made diller said 
its as clean as a whistle he said 
hubbles six nickelhydrogen batteries are undergoing 130 hours 
of recharging at a laboratory in the vehicle assembly building 
they will be put back in the telescope saturday 
the batteries will power hubble from the time it is disconnected 
from discoverys power system until its energycollecting solar 
panels are deployed 380 miles above earth once in orbit the 
telescope will enable astronomers to study stars and galaxies so 
distant their light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion 
years 
because of preparations for discovery are going so smoothly 
nasa is considering advancing the mission to tuesday said nasa 
spokesman ed campion 
test of the apu is the long pole in the tent campion said 
if that goes well theyll poll each of the launch team members 
and ask how their work is going their ability to support an 
advance in the launch date if they all say they can then we 
probably would move up the date 
the decision expected wednesday also will depend on whether a 
change interferes with work preparing columbias payload for 
launch diller said the agency plans to roll columbia out sunday 
to the second of the kennedy space centers two shuttle launch pads 
columbia was transferred from the orbiter processing facility to 
the vehicle assembly building on monday the move was delayed three 
days so technicians could replace a leaking hydraulic part in the 
shuttles nose landing gear

tourists love the brass bands that blare out 
dixieland music all day long in the french quarters jackson 
square but merchants and residents in the heart of the jazz 
citadel are suing to turn down the volume 
their lawsuit filed monday says the music is causing 
headaches stress buzzing in the eardrums loss of sleep 
nervousness irritability mental and emotional turmoil 
it would be like somebody putting two or three big huge brass 
bands below your window where you live or where you work all day 
every day lawyer and shop owner luke fontana said tuesday 
jackson square is considered by many the heart of the french 
quarter the oldest section of the city the mississippi river 
runs along one boundary of the square the other boundaries are 
formed by st louis cathedral and other historic buildings housing 
museums shops bars and apartments 
stone sidewalks and a black iron fence form a perimeter around a 
small grassy treeshaded park at the center of which is a statue 
of andrew jackson on horseback 
tourists flock to the square in good weather many have their 
portraits painted or caricatures done by street artists who set up 
shop on the sidewalks others gather around the brass bands and 
throw money into the musicians hats or empty instrument cases 
music has been part of the scene for years but brad thoren one 
of the artists involved in the lawsuit said that in the past 
couple of years too many musicians have been playing too loudly 
too often hes concerned that the excessive noise could damage the 
hearing of those exposed to it every day 
you have to shout to your customer to be heard that is a 
hazard thats a proven fact he said 
noise ordinances that could solve the problem already are on the 
books fontana said the lawsuit would make the police do more to 
enforce them 
new orleans civil court judge richard ganucheau set a hearing on 
the lawsuit for april 27 
every musician thats on the street is going to be there 
said anthony tuba fats lacen leader of the sixpiece chosen 
few jazz band that regularly plays the square 
lacen said new orleans still suffering from an economic 
slowdown that hit in the early 1980s needs all the tourist dollars 
it can get and restricting the musicians could drive away tourists 
if theyre not interested in keeping our city alive then what 
are they doing here lacen asked 
thoren said the problem isnt so much professionals like lacen 
its youngsters who dont play very well to begin with playing in 
makeshift bands on weekends and afternoons after school 
with the growing number of musicians there is growing 
competition for tourist attention and money said lee tucker an 
artist and french quarter resident 
the street performers themselves have been competing against 
each other and the way they eliminate the competition is to play 
louder said tucker 
fontana is sensitive to the argument that tourists like the 
dixieland bands but there is more than tourism at stake he said 
blaring brass bands lend nothing to the centuriesold 
architecture and charm of the quarter he said and reducing the 
number of musicians wont chase tourists away he added 
the quality of life is the intrinsic economic core of the 
community said fontana and that is where the money is in the 
long run 
caught in the middle is capt george bourgeois commander of the 
police departments vieux carre division 
bourgeois said he has too few men trained in the use of sound 
measuring equipment to enforce the loudness provision of the noise 
ordinance 
and the departments legal counsel has advised against 
enforcement of a law forbidding the playing of an instrument that 
is clearly audible more than 50 feet away

rep charles bennett dfla said tuesday 
that he will introduce a bill this week with the most comprehensive 
wetlands policy yet sent to congress 
he said the bill follows president bushs policy of no overall 
net loss in wetlands and would restore and create such areas 
it is supported by the national wildlife federation and former 
new jersey gov thomas kean who chaired a national committee that 
evaluated wetland policies and made recommendations to the 
environmental protection agency 
bennett said the bill makes improvements on the agreement 
reached last year between the army corps of engineers and the epa 
over wetlands that agreement originally was applauded by 
environmentalists but met with such opposition from developers that 
it was modified 
bennett said that even though he calls his bill the wetlands no 
net loss act of 1990 it doesnt call for discontinuation of 
development 
however it does mean that every attempt should be made to 
direct growth away from wetlands where possible and to minimize 
the effects on wetlands where avoidance is not possible he said 
he said the legislation provides clear definitions of wetlands 
and would settle conflicts between state and federal jurisdictions

the state department said tuesday that some 
russian writers on an officially sponsored tour of the united 
states hold antisemitic views 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler called their views abhorrent 
and said one purpose of the tour funded by the us information 
agency was to educate the writers about how the united states 
works as a multiethnic society based on individual freedoms 
the us official reading from a prepared statement added 
bringing them here does not signal that we approve or sanction 
their views 
the tour prompted a complaint from the american jewish committee 
its naive to believe such people can be converted 
overnight said david harris director of its washington office 
we are giving the group undue exposure by bringing them to the 
united states at american taxpayer expense he said and i am 
concerned we are dignifying and legitimizing this group which can 
only strengthen their hand when they return to the ussr 
harris in an interview called the group both antisemitic and 
antireformist someone here did not do their homework he said 
a russian jewish emigre whose studies of antisemitic writers 
were used by the committee semyon reznick said some writers in 
the group exuded the myth of a jewishzionist conspiracy an old 
russian hatred in their work 
frank s johnson jr a spokesman for the us information 
agency said i dont know that they are antisemitic i dont 
know that they are not either we feel very strongly that 
pluralism in this country is worth talking about and observing 
but ms tutwiler asked if some of the russians might have 
antisemitic views replied my understanding is that some of the 
people do hold those views but our opinion as you know is that 
we bring all types of groups here and it is not a sanction or 
endorsement of those views at all 
she said secretary of state james a baker iii had raised the 
issue of growing antisemitism in the soviet union with foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze in their last two rounds of 
meetings 
ms tutwiler said perestroika the reconstruction policy of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev should bring more tolerance 
not intolerance 
emigre reznick singled out stanislav kunyaev as a big fish 
of antisemitic writers in the group 
as editor of nash sovremenik our contemporary kunyaev wrote 
an article praising the longdiscredited protocols of the elders 
of zion as written by very clever people who understand the 
history of mankind 
the protocols purport to be an account of a meeting of jewish 
leaders plotting to control the world adolf hitler in germany and 
czarist rulers in russia used the fictitious documents to stir up 
antijewish sentiments to murderous levels 
another writer in the russian group olveg mikhaylov has 
written of the late 18th century russian writer gavril gerzhavin as 
a victim of a jewish plot reznik said 
johnson of the usia said the writers were selected by public 
affairs and cultural affairs officers of the us embassy in moscow 
who were seeking to bring conservative russian nationalists to the 
united states 
states tutwiler said the purpose of these programs is to 
bring people to the united states so they can see how our society 
works the goal of these programs is an educational goal teaching 
people about the united states we bring people with a wide range 
of opinions to the united states including some with whom we 
thoroughly disagree and whose views we find abhorrent

the judge in the fraud trial of imelda marcos 
threatened supporters of the former philippine first lady with 
contempt on tuesday for hissing and groaning during the 
crossexamination of a government witness 
judge john f keenan redfaced and angry stood up at the bench 
and said to the courtroom at large i dont know who started 
that but you make one more noise and youre out of here 
keenan threatened to hold anyone involved in a future outburst 
in contempt of court this is not shea stadium or yankee stadium 
or madison square garden the judge said you dont cheer for 
one side or another 
the brief noisy reaction came as mrs marcos attorney gerald 
spence elicited from the witness dr angelita reyes that she 
mistakenly testified that she signed an fbi affidavit in 1988 
instead of the correct date in 1986

and bank records that showed mrs marcos used the pseudonym jane 
ryan in an account at the swiss credit bank in zurich

a burglary suspect was killed when he broke into a 
warehouse and tripped a boobytrapped shotgun police said 
authorities said three youths with the teenager said they were 
looking for adventure 
michael mccomb 19 was shot in the chest at the warehouse 
saturday night while leading three juveniles in what police called 
a burglary attempt police said a shotgun was propped up inside the 
warehouse and attached to a trip wire 
the downtown warehouse leased to philip connaghan of suburban 
arvada had been burglarized eight times since 1987 with shop 
tools targeted each time the handyman lost more than 7000 in 
tools in a burglary last july the warehouse also housed vehicle 
parts acetylene torches and camper shells 
connaghan who was out of town and spoke once to authorities by 
telephone has denied any knowledge of the booby trap according to 
police 
connaghan could not be reached tuesday a call to his home was 
answered by a person who refused to give a name and said connaghan 
was not home 
a city ordinance prohibits the setting of booby traps at 
businesses and violators can face misdemeanor charges said city 
assistant district attorney chuck lepley he said the ordinance was 
enacted because booby traps can backfire and injure the innocent 
in cases where someone dies whoever set the booby trap can be 
charged with murder said lepley 
the three youths were arrested saturday night and were booked 
for investigation of burglary and released to their parents 
these kids are talking about going out and exploring they 
call it exploring and adventuring said police sgt doug 
hildebrant 
its almost like a game they were in it for the excitement 
city district attorney norm early said colorados make my 
day law which allows householders to use deadly force to defend 
themselves probably does not apply the law was nicknamed after a 
line from a clint eastwood movie 
you just cannot go around intentionally taking someones life 
to protect property the district attorney said monday the 
property must be a dwelling and the person who does the shooting 
must be present 
the colorado supreme court ruled defendants must prove they were 
in danger when they used deadly force against intruders 
connaghan said previously he had tried almost everything to keep 
out burglars but they just kept breaking in he parked vehicles in 
front of the doors and burglars towed them out of the way and 
broke in he put up fence topped with three strips of barbed wire 
and they still got in 
less than three weeks ago someone hooked a chain to a large bay 
door attached it to a vehicle and ripped the door off its hinges 
a guard dog connaghan bought reportedly ran away 
kevin corbin owner of the skyline cafe where connaghan stopped 
for coffee said he offered connaghan some advice 
phil if it was my restaurant they were hitting id sit here 
with a gun and make sure i was never robbed again 
connaghan had his own plan he welded the second bay door shut 
and ran rods through the concrete walls 
connaghan said that if someone tried to take down the door this 
time theyd have to take down the entire building according to 
corbin 
in florida in 1986 a liberty city discount store owner rigged 
an electrical booby trap to deter burglars and the trap 
electrocuted a burglary suspect the dade county grand jury refused 
to indict the store owner saying he had not meant to kill only to 
shock

the contra rebels are quickly demobilizing 
but it is doubtful they will all lay down their weapons by the time 
daniel ortega steps down as president of nicaragua april 25 even 
though their camps should be dismantled by then a top us 
official said tuesday 
demobilization as agreed to seems to be proceding on 
schedule and moving toward dismantling of the contra camps along 
the honduran border by next week assistant secretary of state 
bernard aronson told reporters following president bushs meeting 
with visiting honduran president rafael callejas 
honduras has pressed for the rebels speedy repatriation 
aronson said it is unlikely all the contras will surrender their 
weapons by the time incoming presideent violeta chamorro takes over 
from ortega 
the time frame is moving along faster than people 
anticipated for demobilizing the rebel forces aronson said 
the camps should be dismantled in honduras before the 
inauguration those contras have turned in their weapons or are in 
the process of turning in their weapons you need to work out a 
process whereby arms can be laid down with confidence and a sense 
of security 
under peace accords reached by the five presidents of the 
region the contras are to demobilize into security zones inside 
nicaragua and disarm under un supervision 
clearly the entire demobilization will not have taken place by 
april 25th aronson said president ortega knows that he 
said in reference to ortegas demand monday that complete 
disarmament take place so a peaceful transition can occur 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration expects a complete orderly transfer of power 
next week she added the sandinistas rhetorical statements such 
as those made recently are unhelpful to the transition process 
there can be no legitimate reason or international support for 
conditioning this transfer 
vice president dan quayle will lead the us delegation to mrs 
chamorros inaugural among other members of the delegation 
according to an administration source will be the presidents son 
jeb bush sen richard lugar rind and sen christopher dodd 
dconn 
aronson said that 3000 to 5000 contra fighters remain in the 
honduran camps down from a peak of 12000 in addition the camps 
house 40000 family members and honduras is home to about 125000 
refugees who have fled nicaragua aronson said 
pressed by honduras for economic and trade assistance the 
united states is preparing a bridge loan to help honduras with its 
247 million foreign debt aronson said following the visit 
he said that the exact amount of the us loan is not decided 
yet and that it will be part of a package that also includes new 
international lending with participation by japan and other 
countries 
bush after his oval office meeting with callejas lauded the 
role honduras played in the central american peace process that led 
to the feb 25 nicaraguan elections and the end of the decadelong 
contra war 
we support this process and will work to ensure humanitarian 
assistance to those in need in both nicaragua and honduras as they 
return to their homes their families and their jobs and play a 
vital role in helping nicaragua establish lasting democratic 
institutions bush said 
aronson said the two presidents had discussed concerns involving 
nicaragua in particular the longstanding desire by honduras to rid 
itself of the border camps housing the usbacked contras 
he obviously is hopeful the process will move toward 
repatriation aronson said describing callejas as optimistic about 
the matter 
bushs 47 million contra aid package includes 33 million for 
repatriation of the contras and their families plus money to go to 
the un refugee commission for resettlement of the refugee 
families

the number of terrorist acts around the 
world rose 17 percent to 4368 last year and it will only get 
worse the fbis chief bomb technician said tuesday at a conference 
on airport security 
the numbers just keep going up and we dont see anything 
thats going to negate that trend including multimilliondollar 
bomb detection systems said robert quigley the head of the 
agencys bomb data center 
the number of incidents last year was up from 3734 in 1988 
quigley said there were 1930 bombings last year compared with 
1622 in 1988 
one of the worst incidents of terrorism was in december 1988 
when a bomb said to be concealed as a radio felled pan am flight 
103 over lockerbie scotland all 259 people on board as well as 
11 people on the ground were killed 
quigley was among bomb and security experts meeting at the 
massachusetts institute of technology to discuss the status of 
airport safety 
raymond salazar director of civil aviation security for the 
federal aviation administration said the only way to combat 
terrorism is through cooperation 
well never be 100 percent effective salazar said in 
preventing criminal acts your major obstacle is the mind of the 
person who is trying to do you harm and that person will always 
be a halfstep ahead 
however terrorists wont win if local governments law 
enforcement and intelligence work together salazar said 
the arsenal against terrorists now includes automated explosive 
detection systems developed by the faa salazar said he estimated 
the faa spent about 60 million over 10 years to develop the 
systems which use thermalneutron analysis 
the system is being used at new yorks john f kennedy 
international airport and at the miami international airport 
others are planned for dulles international airport near 
washington dc and at airports in england and west germany 
salazar said 
about 200 systems will be deployed in 40 airports worldwide 
within the next two years he said 
critics say the new systems are too large too slow like 
trying to stuff an elephant into a horses stall salazar said 
to these critics i say you have to start somewhere you cant 
wait for perfect while you have good available 
about 12 billion passengers are screened in the united states a 
year or about 2300 a minute salazar said about 125 billion 
pieces of carryon luggage are screened annually he said 
that means find the hijacker find the bomb in about four to 
six seconds per person per article or less he said these 
constraints are dictated by the passenger he said its keep me 
safe but please dont make it inconvenient

the state house on tuesday failed to 
override gov judd greggs veto of an abortion rights bill that the 
governor said was too liberal 
the bill would have given women the right to unrestricted 
abortions until the fetus could live outside the womb supporters 
had argued that the bill essentially put into law what is current 
practice 
the 215157 vote fell 33 short of the twothirds needed for 
override 
chances had been bleak that lawmakers would override the veto 
but abortionrights advocates held out hope that more sympathizers 
than opponents would be present for the showdown house rules base 
the number of votes needed to override on those present and voting 
not the entire membership 
two previous house votes approved the legislation by comfortable 
margins but short of the twothirds to override 
i really dont think the majority of the people in this state 
support letting new hampshire have the most liberal abortion law in 
the nation the governor said after the vote 
rep stephanie micklon one of the bills sponsors called it 
patronizing and bizarre that new hampshire refuses to make 
motorcyclists wear helmets or drivers wear seat belts and allows 
people to buy assault rifles under the mantle of freedom of choice 
but hasnt given abortion rights to women 
all these people may make very personal choices but the women 
of new hampshire she said 
the bill also would have allowed abortions after fetal viability 
to protect the life or health of the mother or if the fetus has a 
lifethreatening physical or congenital abnormality it would 
repeal three unenforced antiabortion statutes enacted in 1848 
if the house had voted to override the bill would have gone 
back to the senate for an override vote the senate originally 
passed the bill 1410 two shy of twothirds 
in his veto message gregg argued that the bill would authorize 
abortion for convenience sex selection as a form of birth 
control and with or without parental notification or consent in the 
case of a minor 
abortionrights proponents had hoped to put the principles of 
the 1973 us supreme court ruling legalizing abortions into state 
law in case the federal court turns greater regulatory control over 
abortion to the states

soviets rallied tuesday by the tens of thousands 
in moscow and leningrad in support of two embattled prosecutors 
whose anticorruption probe has become a lightning rod for popular 
resentment of communist party privilege 
about 10000 people gathered in the shadow of moscows kremlin 
and journalists said at least as many met in front of the former 
czarist winter palace in leningrad as the supreme soviet parliament 
in moscow considered lifting the legislative immunity of the two 
telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov 
gdlyan and ivanov are our conscience read signs carried by 
the moscow crowdthe fate of gdlyan and ivanov is the fate of 
democracy protect them the two gained fame uncovering a trail 
of bribery and corruption in uzbekistan that led to the soninlaw 
of the late president leonid i brezhev 
populist communist leader boris n yeltsin criticized as 
incomplete a nearly yearlong investigation of gdlyan and ivanov by 
a legislative committee and urged the legislators to keep their 
immunity intact 
if today we lift parliamentary immunity from these two 
deputies tomorrow the same could happen to others because some of 
us as peoples deputies are already feeling pressure from many 
sides yeltsin said 
he said the communist party politburo dallied for months in 1986 
on a request by the prosecutors to open an investigation targeting 
a former leader of the soviet central asian republic of uzbekistan 
the supreme soviet made no decision tuesday and was expected to 
continue its debate on wednesday 
gdlyan and ivanov did not attend the session they reportedly 
were in the armenian republic where they were nominated for vacant 
congress posts in the event they are stripped of the legislative 
seats they now hold 
ivanov also has tied the name of conservative politburo member 
yegor k ligachev to his corruption probe the tass news agency 
said the two in a newspaper article accused soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev of turning a blind eye to the mafia 
soviet officials accused the two of abusing their power and 
making unjustified public accusations against senior leaders in an 
effort to increase their popularity 
riding a wave of popularity ivanov was elected to the national 
congress of peoples deputies from leningrad and gdlyan was elected 
from moscow last march 
they cannot be charged with abusing their power unless the 
supreme soviet strips them of legislative immunity 
the two prosecutors were taken off their cases and on feb 21 
were expelled from the communist party they and their supporters 
portray the actions as a move by party officials to protect 
themselves by curbing the investigation 
leningrad journalist maxim korzhov said a crowd marching to 
leningrads palace square carried a portrait of gorbachev with the 
word resign scrawled over it in black 
he estimated the leningrad crowd at 200000 a western

a british steelmaker said tuesday it is afraid it 
may have been duped into supplying iraq with a recoil mechanism for 
a giant gun 
walter somers ltd of birmingham issued a statement as customs 
agents resumed a major investigation into the seizure of eight 
steel tubes bound for iraq that were manufactured by rival company 
sheffield forgemasters 
customs officials say the tubes could be used as part of a huge 
artillery piece forgemasters says the tubes were part of a 
petrochemical installation 
on sunday forgemasters denied the eight tubes could be joined 
together as part of a towering gun to attack iraqs middle east 
enemies or launch satellites 
walter somers a subsidiary of eagle trust said engineers were 
concerned that hydraulic equipment walter somers shipped to iraq 
last october could be used as part of a heavyduty shock absorber 
possibly a hydraulic recoil mechanism in a huge gun 
our engineers are now wondering whether they have been misled 
up the garden path by the iraqis eagle trust chairman david 
james said in a statement 
customs officials seized documents last week from walter somers 
which had previously manufactured pipes for iraq and from 
sheffield forgemasters 
the customs investigation was very appropriate and we are 
concerned to establish the facts james said we think it is in 
the interests of the international community as well as a national 
responsibility 
he said the company refused to ship a component iraq first 
inquired about last october and then sent an urgent order for in 
early april 
reevaluated in the light of subsequent events and publicity 
there was concern that the component described in the order might 
be used as a positioning or aiming device for a gigantic weapon 
he said 
the company notified the department of trade and industry of its 
concern on april 9 the department declined comment tuesday 
james said the component in the 131000 order was designed to 
resemble a 60degree segment of a circle with an arc about 25 feet 
across 
it was intended to be laid flat on the ground as a means of 
positioning or maneuvering a large pipe he said i cant think 
of any technology where you would want to maneuver a pipe of that 
size it was to have been fabricated in a number of pieces and the 
sections welded 
james said walter somers decided to reexamine its contracts 
with iraq following the murder in brussels on march 22 of american 
ballistics expert gerald bull he said bull and his company space 
research corp of brussels acted as agents for various iraqi 
orders and was the source of technical data and drawings related to 
them 
belgian police said the 62yearold canadianborn us citizen 
was shot twice in the head that the gunman used a silencer and 
the motive was not robbery because 20000 was found in the 
victims pockets 
in a statement monday forgemasters lawyer stuart benson said 
the companys contract with iraq involved bulls space research 
corp which had designed a satellite launch system 
customs seized eight forged steel tubes bound for iraq on april 
12 forgemasters said it agreed to supply 52 sections of the steel 
tubing for a petrochemical plant and delivered 44 to the ministry 
of industry and minerals in baghdad 
walter somers said iraq had asked it to bid for a contract for 
pipes like those seized but that the company did not have the 
factory capacity james said he believed the order went to 
forgemasters 
walter somers believed until now that its orders from iraq were 
for iraqs petrochemical industry exports licensed by the 
department of trade and industry james said 
its previous orders with iraq were worth about 31 million 
including the 90000 hydraulic equipment deal last october he 
said 
on march 28 british customs officers arrested five people at 
heathrow airport and seized 40 usmade components for nuclear 
bomb triggers that were being shipped to iraq one of those 
arrested was deported one was released and three await trial

the ethnic tensions in the soviet union have 
spread to the military causing problems recruiting soldiers from 
areas of unrest janes defense weekly said tuesday 
the authoritative magazine said many ethnic groups were reticent 
to join the armed forces and nationalist cliques within the 
military caused fights and disciplinary problems 
the multiethnic mix of the soviet armed forces is 
increasingly in doubt as the military finds itself trapped between 
nationalist pressures within and outside its ranks janes 
reported 
since nationilist protests began in december 1986 in kazakhstan 
ethnic riots have occured in the soviet republics of azerbaijan 
armenia georgia uzbekistan and the baltic states of lithuania 
estonia and latvia 
initially protests focused on assigning ethnic draftees outside 
their own republics but janes said it now includes recruitment 
boycotts 
janes quoted ground forces commanderinchief gen valentin 
varennikov as warning the military cannot and does not remain 
aloof from the peoples concerns problems and misfortunes 
the british magazine which has wide contacts in military 
matters also quoted a report in the soviet army newspaper 
krasnaya zvezda which said the azeri popular front in azerbaijan 
had told its members not to evade conscription but to join the army 
and learn combat skills for the struggle to free azerbaijan 
the army is proving no more successful than the communist 
party in managing tensions janes said 
in lithuania since the republic declared independence on march 
11 the republics legislature halted spring conscription and many 
ethnic lithuanian soldiers deserted

the justice department disclosed tuesday it 
won a court order for records of 754 us bank accounts where it 
said colombias medellin cartel stashed 400 million from cocaine 
sales on american streets 
the action marks the first time that federal authorities traced 
dollar for dollar drug money from us street sales that was 
laundered through foreign accounts and returned to american banks 
officials said 
the department obtained a court order in atlanta directing 173 
banks in 22 states and the nations capital to turn over the 
records that officials said could yield a wealth of financial 
information about the cartel 
the order signed monday by a federal judge in atlanta also 
directed banks to freeze 684 accounts linked to eduardo martinez 
romero who was extradited in september to face charges he 
laundered drug money for the cartel or others charged in the case 
including reputed cartel leader pablo escobar 
based on information contained in the records the justice 
department plans to seek similar court orders in miami and new york 
against other accounts officials said 
the legal action is likely to produce more information than 
money but should help investigators continue their pursuit along 
the global money trail left by the cocaine dealers said peter g 
djinis a justice department trial attorney 
we think this is going to point fingers in a lot of 
directions he said were getting closer and well eventually 
catch up to the money 
agents for the drug enforcement administration the internal 
revenue service and the us customs service participating in the 
longrunning operation polar cap probe of the colombian cartel 
traced the money through eight foreign countries 
the investigation determined that the cartel amassed 12 
billion from selling cocaine in the united states between 1987 and 
early 1989 the funds were deposited in american banks and 
transferred overseas 
some of the money was invested in foreign countries or used to 
buy equipment and supplies for cocaine production officials said 
an estimated 350 million was wired back to us banks and 
deposited with 50 million that was left behind 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the departments action 
seeks to lift the veil of secrecy over the financial network of 
these narcoterrorists 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the money was 
traced through banks in colombia panama uruguay luxembourg 
switzerland britain canada and austria 
the review of the bank records obtained with the cooperation of 
the foreign countries began almost a year ago officials said 
in miami us customs commissioner carol hallett said the bank 
accounts could not have been traced without the help of panama 
we have been working very closely with the government of 
panama she said 
djinis said officials dont know how much of the 400 million is 
still in the accounts the records could also confirm suspicions 
that the cartel bought us real estate he said 
the accounts were listed under the names of martinez or other 
people djinis said the 2yearold son of a cartel member was 
listed as the holder of a panamanian bank account officials said 
the cartel needed money in american bank accounts to keep up 
the payroll and buy such equipment as aircraft for the shipment 
of cocaine djinis said 
the only way to administer these activities is to have ongoing 
capital in the us he said 
in one case money was drawn from an account to buy an 
americanmade airplane which was flown to colombia to pick up a 
load of cocaine the plane made a crash landing in canada with its 
cargo intact djinis said 
we are not at this time suggesting the banks had knowledge and 
were knowing and willing participants in the return of the funds to 
the us djinis said but we are not ruling out anything 
bank officials suspicious of the large cash deposits reported 
their concerns to federal law enforcement authorities djinis said 
the investigation is only one of a number of largescale probes 
of money laundering said a law enforcement official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the official said there are as many as 10 other investigations 
under way

oklahomas teacher strike spread tuesday 
with thousands more planning to join later in the week and 
teachers continued to picket the state capitol demanding increased 
funding for education 
at least one school board voted to close schools to allow its 
teachers to join the protest 
about 60 percent of the states teachers or about 20000 were 
of the job on the second day of the strike said the oklahoma 
education association the teacher union that called for the 
walkout that was up from about 16000 monday 
we think its growing said sandy garrett education 
secretary in gov henry bellmons cabinet were hearing from 
more and more schools that are going to be closed the rest of the 
week 
ms garrett estimated that the walkout had affected about 60 
percent or 343200 of the states 572000 students 
teachers are venting their frustration over the legislatures 
failure after an eightmonth special session to enact a 230 
million school reform and tax plan that contains funds for 
increased teacher salaries 
the education package calls for raising the money by increasing 
sales and personal and corporate income taxes it mandates 
1500peryear increases in teachers minimum salary schedules 
over the next four years eventually boosting that from the present 
15000 a year to about 24000 
the oea says oklahoma teachers rank 48th in teacher pay among 
the states making an average 22000 a year far less than the 
national average of 29648 
officials in oklahoma city and other municipalities not yet 
participating in the walkout decided tuesday to close schools later 
in the week to allow their teachers to join those on the picket 
lines 
the oklahoma city school board voted to use one of its snow 
days on thursday to allow the closing of schools oklahoma city 
has about 2200 teachers 
that announcement brought a round of cheers from those picketing 
at the capitol the majority of oklahoma city teachers are not 
affiliated with the oea and officials of their union the american 
federation of teachers initially balked at joining the walkout 
in tulsa superintendent bruce howell canceled schools for the 
rest of the week because of the prospects of an emergency 
jeopardizing the health and safety of children 
a decision had been made earlier to close tulsa schools only on 
monday and tuesday but howell said about 80 percent of teachers 
indicated they would not be in class wednesday 
officials estimated that 8000 to 10000 people walked picket 
lines at the capitol on tuesday 
karla feeley oea communications director and a spokeswoman for 
the department of education estimated there were 35000 
nonsupervisory teachers in the state the education agency said an 
earlier figure of 40052 teachers includedsome principals and other 
school personnel 
the oea says it represents about 31000 teachers 
the education bill stalled on the senate calendar last week when 
leaders were unable to get the twothirds majority needed to attach 
an emergency clause which would have made the measure take effect 
immediately 
senate president pro tempore bob cullison said there were 
discussions in tulsa over the weekend on a possible alternate tax 
package more legislators might support but he said there was no 
firm indication the deadlock can be broken

labor party leader shimon peres said tuesday he 
will present a minority government for parliamentary approval next 
week israel television reported 
last week peres tried to present a majority government but his 
efforts collapsed when two lastminute defections from an 
ultraorthodox party prevented him from securing the necessary 61 
votes in the 120member parliament 
under israeli law peres can form a government with less than 61 
seats if his party has the support of more legislators than any 
other coalition and no party can muster a majority 
peres did not say which other parties would join his government 
every israeli government since its founding in 1948 has been a 
coalition or how many seats it would have 
israels two major parties peres leftleaning labor and acting 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud each have the 
support of almost 60 legislators but their ability to produce a 
majority has depended on small religious parties and defectors who 
have proven unstable in their support 
peres statement comes almost a month after he was designated by 
president chaim herzog to form israels next government 
peres said he will still trying to form a majority government 
both peres and shamir have been placing their hopes on the 
support of the ultraorthodox shas or sephardic torah guardian 
party which has now become a powerbroker of sorts with its five 
members in parliament 
the spiritual mentor of shas rabbi ovadia yosef is scheduled 
to meet with both peres and shamir on wednesday to decide which 
party he will recommend supporting the television said 
peres has been trying to put together a coalition with 
leftwing arab and ultraorthodox parties since labor engineered 
the collapse of the national unity government on march 15 after the 
likud refused to accept a us peace proposal 
on march 20 herzog gave him three weeks to form a new 
government but peres was granted a twoweek extension when his 
efforts collapsed

a district of columbia judge has dismissed a 
lawsuit against rep barney frank dmass alleging that franks 
relationship with a male prostitute amounted to a public nuisance 
franks office said tuesday 
the suit alleged that frank was aware his capitol hill apartment 
was being used by stephen gobie for his prostitution business 
superior court judge harold cushenberry dismissed the suit on 
the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right to bring it and that 
any alleged nuisance was clearly not continuing 
the onepage decision dated april 10 was released by franks 
office tuesday as frank in boston was announcing his candidacy 
for a sixth term 
the suit was filed two ministers of washington churches the 
rev cleveland b sparrow sr and the rev john g martin it was 
financially backed by the conservative caucus which has long 
opposed many of franks liberal views john f banzhaf iii a law 
professor at george washington university and a legal gadfly who 
has pressed a number of highprofile cases in washington helped 
prepare it 
frank has admitted paying gobie for sexual favors and hiring him 
as a personal aide 
attorneys for frank argued that frank was unaware of gobies 
prostitution business that frank fired gobie as soon as he found 
out that frank no longer lived in the capitol hill apartment and 
that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue frank 
in his onepage order cushenberry wrote that he concluded 
that an ongoing statutory violation is required to seek an 
injunction against frank blocking the alleged nuisance and that the 
plaintiffs have failed to allege the special damage that must 
be pleaded in order for a private party to prosecute a public 
nuisance claim 
banzhaf tried an unusual legal tactic in which technically the 
suit was being brought by the united states government what i 
tried to do was use a very unusual and heretofore untested statute 
to deal with an unusual situation banzhaf said in that area 
its very difficult to predict what the court will do and its not 
unusual not to win 
banzhaff has said he would explore other avenues to bring a case 
against frank

mikhail s gorbachevs threatened economic embargo on the wayward 
republic local sources said 
lithuanian energy minister leonas asmantas told a news 
conference late tuesday the republic received unofficial 
information crude oil supplies would be reduced about 7 am 
wednesday tuesday midnight edt and that natural gas supplies 
would be scaled back too said official spokesmen and western 
journalists on the scene 
asmantas was quoted as saying gas supplies might be cut 50 
percent 
premier kazimiera prunskiene told lithuanians to view the move 
as the beginning of liberty because it signified moscows 
recognition of lithuania as a separate entity from the soviet 
union said one western journalist who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
mrs prunskiene said lithuania had been contacted by us and 
canadian petroleum companies who are inclined to come to our 
rescue but did not specify which companies or how they could 
deliver supplies 
asmantas said he had no official word but believed based on 
moscow sources that the cuts would occur imminently 
worried lithuanians flooded the government in vilnius with phone 
calls tuesday 
last friday gorbachev threatened to impose an embargo of key 
goods and raw materials unless lithuania rescinded within 48 hours 
several laws meant to back up its march 11 declaration of 
independence 
moscow would demand hard currency from lithuania for supplies of 
materials the soviet union sells abroad for convertible currency 
the soviet president said oil and gas are the soviet unions 
biggest earners of foreign currency 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis on tuesday called the 
republics decisions irreversible and said an economic embargo 
will only strengthen the resolve of the 38 million lithuanians 
i hope it will consolidate our people in our peaceful 
struggle landsbergis said in a broadcast interview 
lithuanian gas officials received a telegram from the acting 
general director of the soviet unions western gas network saying 
implementing the orders of the government of the soviet union 
and those of the state gas concern supplies of natural gas to 
the lithuanian soviet socialist republic will be sharply reduced 
from the 17th of apri 
sources in the capital vilnius said the republic was receiving 
its full supply of natural gas late tuesday night 
however the western journalist quoted gas officials as saying 
they regarded the telegram received late monday as 24hour advance 
notice the supply would be reduced and they expected a cut to 
begin overnight 
nearly all western journalists were forced by the soviet 
government to leave lithuania last month though a few remain 
lithuanian officials are discussing shifting some oil and gas 
from industrial production to use in homes and hospitals if the 
cuts occur but so far have not publicly discussed a conservation 
program 
lithuania uses 185 million cubic meters of natural gas a day 
including 11 million cubic meters for homes 
president bush said in washington the united states was 
considering appropriate responses if supplies are cut but he 
also said he does not want to damage superpower relations 
italys foreign minister gianni de michelis met gorbachev on 
tuesday and quoted him as saying he had to uphold the soviet 
constitution but was still looking for a peaceful way out of the 
dispute without abrupt moves 
de michelis told italian journalists that gorbachev complained 
the lithuanians discussed a law on the republics official language 
for six months but debated independence for only half a night 
at the united nations in new york nadia younes the spokeswoman 
for secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said tuesday he 
considers the lithuanian issue to be strictly an internal 
affair of the soviet union 
hundreds of bulgarian protesters chanted leave lithuania 
alone as they rallied tuesday in front of the soviet embassy in 
sofia the bulgarian capital in the first antisoviet protest 
there in memory 
gorbachev says lithuanian independence can be discussed only 
within the framework of soviet law a law passed this month would 
let republics secede if they gain approval of twothirds of their 
residents in a referendum and wait a maximum of five years 
the kremlin forcibly annexed lithuania estonia and latvia in 
1940 
tass news agency quoted landsbergis as saying in opening 
tuesdays discussion in the lithuanian supreme council legislature 
that lithuanias proindependence moves were irreversible but 
that the republic will search for a dialogue by all possible 
means through various channels 
landsbergis asked bush to make it clear to gorbachev an economic 
embargo on lithuania would be an act of aggression but he declined 
to say if he thought bush should cancel a planned washington summit 
with gorbachev in june 
in a tuesday interview from vilnius with cable news network 
landsbergis also said he expects to receive supplies from 
neighboring soviet republics and even from scandinavia but was 
worried the soviet navy may interfere 
speaker alexandras abisalas read the gas supply telegram to 
lithuanian lawmakers who met to discuss a response to gorbachevs 
ultimatum 
tass said gorbachevs message caused a sharp legislative debate 
between deputies who found it full of threats and others who want 
to compromise no decision was reached tuesday on an official 
response 
the agency quoted landsbergis as saying an embargo on lithuania 
would result in economic losses for other soviet republics 
lithuania produces about twice the milk and meat it needs it 
produces many of the countrys small electronic appliances and all 
of its household electric meters 
lithuanian journalists quoted officials as saying monday that 
the republic had enough natural gas to last about two weeks the 
officials warned that an embargo would throw ethnic russian factory 
workers out of work and affect the kaliningrad area of the russian 
republic as well 
viktoras barmuskas a spokesman for the information bureau of 
the supreme council legislature quoted energy minister asmantas as 
saying lithuanias oil refinery at mazhiekiai would be entitled to 
demand compensation in hard currency for lost production 
asmantas said the plant produces 12 million tons of oil products 
a year valued at 800 million with only a quarter of the output 
used in lithuania and the rest sent to other parts of the soviet 
union 
on monday mrs prunskiene sent a reply to gorbachev asking for 
a meeting to clarify the threat of an economic blockade 
in his message gorbachev had singled out lithuanian moves to 
curtail the spring draft into the soviet army give residents 
lithuanian identity cards and what he said were seize the property 
of the communist party on lithuanian territory

a jerusalem district court panel on tuesday 
upheld an order to evict 150 jewish settlers whose move into the 
arab christian quarter of the old city has fueled antiisraeli 
protests 
the settlers immediately appealed the decision but it was 
rejected by the same district court in a hearing before a single 
judge in that hearing judge ruth orr ordered the settlers to 
evacuate the building by wednesday morning army radio said 
jerusalem police spokesman uzi sandori said police were studying 
the court decision 
the settlers said they plan to appeal the eviction order to the 
supreme court they also said they would not resist police attempts 
to evict them 
of course we will not resist the police said one settler 
who identified himself as doki but there is no reason for them 
to come tomorrow 
early tuesday a threejudge panel of the district court 
conferred nearly four hours behind closed doors before issuing a 
ruling that accused the settlers lawyers of an improper use of 
procedures to say the least 
the judges ruled that a stay of the eviction notice granted 
friday by a single district court judge was improperly obtained 
we invalidate it the judges wrote 
they took the unusual step of assessing court costs of 5000 to 
the settlers lawyers apparently for attempting to thwart the 
israeli legal system 
judge vardimus zailer presided over the threejudge panel which 
also included judge shalom brenner who on friday stayed the 
eviction order 
the ruling said the settlers lawyers in asking brenner for a 
stay had failed to mention another judge turned down a separate 
request for a stay hours earlier 
the judges have canceled the stay they the settlers must be 
evicted said avraham sochozolsky a lawyer for the greek 
orthodox church 
yacov levine a spokesman for the settlers group said their 
lawyers sought a new district court hearing late tuesday to argue 
that the building was rented legally 
at that fivehour hearing judge orr rejected the settler appeal 
and ordered their eviction 
the settler move into the complex has raised tensions in the old 
walled city which is divided into ethnic quarters that are home to 
about 50000 moslems 7000 christians and 4000 jews 
early tuesday several dozen palestinian women and masked youths 
demonstrated inside the church of the holy sepulcher venerated as 
the site of christs burial and regarded by many as christianitys 
holiest shrine 
visiting pilgrims and tourists stared as 40 to 50 protesters 
waved palestinian flags and chanted plo plo and israel no 
palestine yes inside the dark church 
it was the first time arabs had staged a protest inside the 
church since the palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip began 28 months ago 
a week ago the ultraorthodox jews moved into a 72room complex 
near the church under heavy police guard saying they wanted to 
establish the first jewish presence in the christian quarter since 
1936 
the greek orthodox church which owns the property said a 
tenant in the four 100yearold buildings illegally worked out a 
lease with the jews the church sued to have the jewish settlers 
removed 
the establishment of neot david which is hebrew for dwellings 
of david was the largest and most significant settlement of jews 
outside the jewish quarter 
previously two jewish seminaries were set up in the moslem 
quarter and about 40 jewish families took up residence in the area 
including former defense minister ariel sharon 
sharon has visited neot david daily to show support for the 
settlement 
in a visit to the settlement and greek orthodox church 
headquarters tuesday religious affairs minister zevulen hammer 
urged both christians and jews not to blow things out of 
proportion 
they the settlers did not take over some church and did not 
throw someone out of some place but used a site that was a hotel 
that happens to be in the christian quarter he said 
in the occupied gaza strip tuesday israeli troops opened fire 
on stonethrowing demonstrators wounding 23 palestinians hospital 
officials said 
the army confirmed 21 of the wounded 
since the start of the uprising at least 673 palestinians have 
been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians another 207 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaboration with israel and 43 israelis have died in the 
violence

an indian church leader said tuesday the us 
supreme courts ruling that peyote use in religious ceremonies 
isnt protected by the constitution is an example of how little 
society understands indians 
peyote is not a recreational drug used by participants to get 
high said emerson jackson a peyote priest and president of the 
native american church of north america 
we have been doing this all these years before the 
constitution was here i dont see why we cant continue he said 
in a telephone interview from albuquerque nm 
the high court ruled 63 that oregon officials may deny 
unemployment benefits to two fired drug counselors who took small 
amounts of peyote a cactus button containing the hallucinogen 
mescaline in indian religious ceremonies 
alfred smith and galen black were denied the benefits because 
they violated their employers rules by using the illegal drug in 
native american church ceremonies 
oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer said the ruling involved 
whether the men were entitled to a government benefit not whether 
theyd committed a crime 
frohnmayer said the court was making it clear that in terms of 
religious freedom the constitution is written in terms of what 
the government cannot do to the individual not in terms of what 
individuals can extract from government 
the court said the state is not compelled to make exemptions 
for religious use of drugs but said it could if it wished he 
said we have always insisted the state is not required to pay 
people for using illegal substances no matter what their religious 
beliefs might be 
jackson said that wine used as a sacrament in many religious 
ceremonies is more toxic habitforming than peyote 
jackson a navajo indian also said he is waiting for a change 
of administration in oregon so that a centuriesold ritual can 
continue 
this is just the beginning he said perhaps there will be 
a time when their administration will be more favorable to how the 
indian worships the attorney general is not going to stay there 
forever 
lenora begay spokeswoman for the navajo tribe in washington 
dc denounced the ruling 
to punish individuals because of their religious beliefs is 
beyond comprehension and an act of extreme ignorance she 
said 
ellen lowe spokeswoman for ecumenical ministries of oregon 
said the ministries disagreed with the courts ruling 
we see it as an infringement on what we have long felt to be 
first amendment rights for freedom of religion she said for 
those of us in majority faiths there are some exceptions we have 
taken for granted 
she cited serving wine to minors during church ceremonies as an 
example 
the native american church is an umbrella group for 70 chapters 
of the church in western states

holding out at strangeways prison are using drugs from the jail 
pharmacy a home office spokesman said tuesday 
one convict nearly fell off the roof tuesday 17th day of the

prison hospital where most of the prisons drugs are stored 
the spokesman said no negotiations have taken place since three 
prisoners surrendered monday suffering from food poisoning 
there have been no fresh supplies in the victorian jail since 
the mutiny began on april 1 
more than 1500 prisoners rioted at the overcrowded prison 
badly damaging the buildings most surrendered in the first days 
but a hard core remained on the loose 
on sunday prisoners held up a sign saying they would continue 
their standoff for another week 
inmates stockpiled food before the riot but there is no 
refrigeration in the wing they are occupying

the justice department told the supreme court 
tuesday that a 1989 federal law banning flag burning is 
constitutional because it outlaws violent assault on the symbol 
of the nations shared experiences 
unlike a texas flagburning statute that the high court 
overturned last year the flag protection act of 1989 expresses 
the depth of the national interest in protecting the flag the 
department said in brief supporting the new statute 
the law passed in response to the high courts ruling in the 
texas case represents the considered judgment of congress as 
opposed to that of a single state legislature the department 
argued 
congress the president the nations elected representatives 
have now spoken with one voice the physical integrity of the 
flag of the united states as the unique symbol of the nation 
merits protection not accorded other national emblems the 
department said 
in deciding whether the law is constitutional the justices 
should consider that congress also studied this question making a 
legislative determination that the american flag is a unique 
national symbol deserving special protection consistent with 
applicable first amendment limitations 
the governments brief was filed to appeal the dismissal of 
misdemeanor criminal charges against demonstrators who burned flags 
outside the us capitol and in seattle last fall to test the new 
law 
the previous federal statute banned destruction of or damage to 
the flag with contempt similar to the provision in a texas 
statute found unconstitutional on freespeech grounds by the 
supreme court the new law simply dropped any reference to the 
state of mind of the person doing the action 
nonetheless federal judges in the district of columbia and in 
seattle held that flag burning under the new law was still 
political speech protected by the first amendment 
flag burning is by its nature a physical violent assault on 
the most deeply shared experiences of the american people 
including the sacrifices of our fellow citizens in defense of the 
nation and the preservation of liberty the department said in 
the brief by solicitor general kenneth w starr 
the law does not violate the first amendment because it does not 
restrict debate about the flag it merely prohibits physical 
attacks on the national symbol the department said 
it is the physical assault and accompanying violation of the 
flags physical integrity not robust and uninhibited debate 
that occasion the injury that our society should not be called upon 
to bear the brief said 
the high court should treat flag burning the same way it views 
obscene or defamatory speech the justice department said citing a 
list of cases in which the high court upheld prohibitions on child 
pornography or speech that incited violence or illegal activity

president bush called for more research to 
sort out the science of global warming tuesday but ran into a 
storm of criticism at an international white house conference from 
europeans who argued for action 
gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide 
inaction declared klaus topfer the west german environmental 
minister 
bush said he hoped the conference attended by delegates from 19 
nations would prod international research and inject economic 
issues into the debate over the greenhouse effect 
the president called for resolving some of the scientific 
uncertainties and economic implications before making a commitment 
to specific pollution controls to deal with possible gradual 
warming of the earth 
environmental policies that ignores the economic factors the 
human factors are destined to fail he said maintaining anew 
that some scientists are in wide disagreement over the impact of 
manmade pollutants on the temperature of the globe 
many of the european participants especially the west germans 
and the dutch said the conference agenda was narrowly arranged to 
prevent open discussions of policy aimed at dealing with global 
warming 
topfer suggested the german delegation would pursue such 
discussions adding the gravity of the situation requires 
immediate determined action 
similar views were expressed by members of other delegations 
including dutch and french officials 
discussions about further research and economic considerations 
should not distract us from taking action on carbon dioxide 
stabilization now hans alders the dutch environmental minister 
told the conference during a closed working session 
we needed love canal before hazardous waste was tackled we 
needed a dying river rhine before waste water was treated my 
country has decided to learn the lessons from the past and act on 
global warming now alders told the delegates according to a 
transcript made public by the dutch delegation 
i know theres a debate raging out there bush said in his 
welcoming remarks to the delegates all cabinetlevel ministers 
involved in environmental economic and science issues but he said 
he was confident that more research and examination of economic 
factors before action to curb greenhouse pollutants such as 
carbon dioxide is the way to go 
at backtoback news conferences later in the day senior white 
house officials and leaders of the european community sought to 
play down the extent of the discord at the conference and said the 
days sessions had produced considerable common ground on the 
need for additional scientific and economic research 
we didnt come here to argue with the united states or anybody 
else said padraig flynn environment minister for the european 
council a branch of the european community 
allan bromley the presidents science adviser and a cochairman 
of the conference told reporters that bush does not feel in any 
sense that research should be a substitute for action 
and michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of 
economic advisers and also a conference cochairman maintained the 
discord was very narrowly confined to a few delegations 
scientists including bushs own science adviser generally 
agree that manmade pollution especially the release of carbon 
dioxide from burning of fossil fuels is causing heat to be trapped 
and will result in a warming of the globe many say the earths 
temperature could increase by as much as 4 degrees to 9 degrees 
fahrenheit by the middle of the next century causing coastal 
flooding and a shift of weather and agriculture patterns 
environmentalists have urged immediate action by industrial 
countries to curb carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent and many 
of the european countries have called at least for a stabilization 
of such releases by the year 2000 such a commitment would require 
new efforts at energy conservation development of more fuel 
efficient automobiles and more efficient use of energy in homes and 
businesses 
meanwhile us environmentalists accused bush on tuesday of 
abandoning his leadership responsibilities on the global warming 
question by not joining the europeans in a call for firm 
commitments to reduce global warming pollutants 
bush is using the conference as a smoke screen to hide his 
inaction hes using economics as a weapon against environmental 
protection said daniel becker of the sierra club 
rafe pomerance of the world resources institute chided bush 
for suggesting that scientists are at opposite poles on the global 
warming debate he said there is widespread agreement that the 
earth will become warmer if pollution curbs are not put into effect 
at a luncheon address to the conference william reilly head of 
the environmental protection agency maintained the bush 
administration has taken actions to combat global warming 
he cited the push to phase out chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
which are another major cause of global warming a call by bush to 
plant 1 billion trees a year and efforts to toughen federal air 
pollution laws as well as a 1 billion global change research 
effort 
but environmentalists maintained the tree planting effort will 
have scant effect on overall carbon dioxide pollution and that the 
administration vigorously fought efforts in congress to require 
automakers to develop more fuel efficient cars which would have

animal rights groups are outraged over a 
gun clubs plan to hold a prairie dog shooting contest and award 
prizes for the best shots on the critters that ranchers consider 
serious pests 
marksmanship enthusiasts from idaho texas kansas oklahoma 
wyoming and colorado already are calling in for registration forms 
for the july 1415 event billed as the top dog world 
championship prairie dog shoot 
teams killing the most prairie dogs at the greatest distances 
will be eligible for top prizes including imported hunting rifles 
worth more than 1300 
participation will be limited to 50 teams of two people each 
each team will pay 100 
residents of the area in western colorado complain that prairie 
dogs multiply rapidly and create burrows in which cattle can break 
their legs they also damage irrigation systems in a state where 
water is at a premium 
supporter stan austin said the event around the communities of 
nucla and naturita will upset some people but he said nearby moab 
utah has its jeep weekend telluride has its jazz festival 
durango has a bike race and local folks figured they needed to 
offer something different to snare tourists 
fred bellmire a member of the naturita town board said he has 
received a couple of complaints about the prairie dog shoot but he 
said the event would be good for the local tourism economy which 
now relies on hunters showing up during deer and elk season 
the thought that tourists would find it amusing to see animals 
killed is a pretty sick one said katharine thalberg director of 
the aspen society for animal rights 
we may be down to picket i dont know said thalberg who 
led a recent campaign against animal furs in aspen 
chris bishop of prairie dog rescue inc called the event all 
pretty sickening in my opinion 
since august he said the group has moved 997 unwanted prairie 
dogs from the denver metropolitan area to places where they are 
welcome wanted and needed 
bishop said prairie dogs are photographed by countless tourists 
as they stand curiously atop their burrows and they are a main 
component of the prairie ecosystem they provide a food base for 
endangered blackfooted ferrets as well as badgers eagles and 
coyotes bishop said and their abandoned burrows often provide 
shelter to other animals 
mike mehew of the ten ring gun club which is sponsoring the 
event said there are too many prairie dogs to count and said if 
they arent shot during the competition theyll be poisoned 
mehew said the carcasses of the animals will be left on the 
prairie 
i never ate one mehew said we will just leave them

international airport 
under the plan about 5800 homes and a number of schools and 
public buildings would be eligible for soundproofing subsidies 
buyouts or homesale guarantees airport officials said monday 
final approval of the plan wont come until the metropolitan 
airports commission makes a final more detailed proposal to the 
faa later this year said nigel finney a commission official 
the commission hopes to begin insulating a few homes in the 
summer of 1991 finney said 
certain residents who have difficulty selling their homes 
because of airport noise would be eligible for a federal buyout 
option or purchase agreement under part of the program 
if the commission were to buy a home that was not selling it 
would be insulated and returned to the market finney said 
the faa has determined that 18544 people near the airport are 
subjected to 24hour noise levels that average 65 decibels or 
higher 
the commission which began work on a noise compatibility study 
in 1984 estimates that soundproofing and buyouts would cost 60

aftershocks from februarys earthquake shook a wide area of 
southern california tuesday and a small temblor hit rural eastern 
indiana but no damages or injuries were reported in either state 
california residents from los angeles to the mojave desert felt 
a 46magnitude jolt at 332 pm 
centered three miles west of upland the quake followed a trio 
of minor earthquakes under the foothills of the san gabriel 
mountains earlier in the day scientists at the california 
institute of technology said 
it appears to be on the san antonio canyon fault said hall 
daily a caltech spokesman in pasadena what the seismologists 
say is it seems to be extending the aftershock zone to the 
southwest 
it was the usual rolling said gloria kelley a switchboard 
operator for the city of upland 
still she added i dont think you could ever get used to 
this 
the tremors were aftershocks of the damaging magnitude55 
earthquake that rocked southern california on feb 28 said caltech 
spokesman robert finn 
the days aftershocks began with a 34 temblor at 147 am 
centered six miles northwest of upland that was followed by a 33 
quake at 712 am and a 26 aftershock at 719 am both three 
miles west of upland finn said 
two aftershocks measuring 34 and 24 occurred five miles 
northwest of upland early monday upland is in western san 
bernardino county 40 miles east of los angeles 
the feb 28 earthquake caused an estimated 104 million in 
damage according to the state office of emergency services 
indianas tuesday morning quake shook buildings rattled windows 
and woke up residents but caused no damage jay county authorities 
said 
usually an earthquake of this size is only felt over a small 
area said michael hamburger seismologist and geology professor 
at indiana university 
seismology stations throughout the midwest recorded the quake at 
528 am hamburger said 
he put the quakes magnitude at 25 to 3 on the richter scale 
and its epicenter in eastern jay county about 65 miles northeast 
of indianapolis 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage and 5 considerable 
damage

attorney general dick thornburgh said tuesday 
he had asked for a full report on the arrest of a mexican physician 
accused of helping murder a us drug agent in mexico 
thornburgh said he asked the drug enforcement administration to 
file the report after learning monday of news accounts that the 
agency had offered a bounty in mexico for the capture of the 
physician humberto alvarez machain 
dea spokeman frank shults disputed those reports including one 
that the agency planned to pay a reward for the capture of machain 
a guadalajara gynecologist who was indicted jan 31 on federal 
charges of participating in the 1985 murder of enrique kiki 
camarena 
nbc and time magazine both reported last weekend that alvaraz 
was captured by bounty hunters time also reported that dea planned 
to pay a bounty of more than 100000 to the captors 
there was no reward offered period shults said we dont 
have bounties the guy was arrested in el paso on april 3rd and 
arraigned on april 10th 
but shults declined to describe the circumstances of alvarezs 
arrest 
thornburgh was asked about the case during a briefing of foreign 
journalists the day before he is scheduled to go to ixtapa mexico 
for an organization of american states threeday conference on 
hemispheric drug enforcement 
the attorney general said he couldnt comment on the reports 
about alvarezs arrest because he didnt know the facts 
justice department spokesman david runkel denied that 
thornburghs request for the report was an indication that the 
attorney general lacked confidence in deas handling of the matter 
he just wants to get the facts runkel said 
mexican authorities are generally reluctant to extradite mexican 
nationals wanted by us authorities 
in a string of court rulings including a recent supreme court 
decision federal judges have held that the kidnapping of us 
fugitives on foreign soil to bring them to justice does not violate 
american law 
nothwithstanding those rulings shults said dea does not offer 
bounties for the kidnaping of fugitives 
charges against 18 people accused of participating in the 
kidnaping or murder of camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala 
avelar have strained usmexican relations 
the jan 31 indictment returned in los angeles contained the 
latest round of charges in the case besides alvarez it named 
manuel ibarra herrera former director of the mexican federal 
judicial police and miguel aldana ibarra former head of the

the rev ralph david abernathy who created the 
civil rights movement with martin luther king jr but decades later 
enraged the slain leaders supporters by writing about his alleged 
infidelity died tuesday 
abernathy who had cradled the fallen kings bloodied head after 
he was struck down by a bullet in 1968 was 64 
abernathys heart stopped while he was being prepared for a lung 
scan at crawford long hospital said hospital spokeswoman tisha 
burland 
what they were trying to do was detect if there was a blood 
clot in the lungs but they never got to see ms burland said 
abernathy was taken to an operating room but he was pronounced 
dead there at 1210 pm before doctors could begin emergency life 
support surgery she said 
ms burland quoted dr kenneth scheidt a nuclear medicine 
specialist who was present for the scheduled lung scan as saying 
the test never began and could not have contributed to abernathys 
death 
abernathy had been in the hospital since last month for 
treatment of a sodium deficiency he had suffered strokes in 1983 
and 1986 
abernathy spent his last months under bitter criticism from his 
colleagues for passages in his 1989 autobiography and the walls 
came tumbling down he wrote that king had spent time with two 
women and had a violent argument with one in the 24 hours before 
his 1968 assassination 
but the rev joseph lowery who succeeded abernathy as president 
of the southern christian leadership council described abernathy 
on tuesday as a faithful servant of the cause of liberty and 
justice 
i extend my love and support to his family he said 
i salute you ralph for a life of great achievement and 
merit coretta scott king said in a statement from harare 
zimbabwe where she was attending celebrations of that countrys 
10th anniversary of independence 
when our home was bombed and our lives were threatened he was 
there she said his strength as a tactician and a counselor to 
martin during our struggle has been eloquently recorded in martins 
own writings and in the annals of the american civil rights 
movement 
kings son fulton county commissioner martin luther king iii 
called abernathys death a very tragic loss to our nation 
i know firsthand of the sacrifices he made for the civil 
rights movement and that should never be forgotten said 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people 
his total life and passion was his support of martin luther 
king said former mayor andrew young another key king aide in 
the movement young said that if abernathy had a weakness it was 
trying to fill martin luther king jrs shoes after his death and 
that was an impossible task 
state sen arthur langford who visited abernathys family 
tuesday night said the family would probably not make a statement 
until wednesday 
abernathy was pastor of atlantas west hunter street baptist 
church and president emeritus of the sclc which he founded with 
king in 1957 as a vehicle for the movement they began with the 1955 
bus boycott in montgomery ala 
abernathy had said he had no desire to lead the movement 
preferring to leave that role to the more charismatic king but two 
days after kings assassination the remaining aides picked him as 
sclc president according to kings wishes 
he was sclc president for nine years as the focus of the 
movement shifted from voting rights and civil rights to economic 
issues like employment and antipoverty programs 
he left the sclc presidency in 1977 when he resigned to run for 
congress he was defeated in the democratic primary in 1980 he 
supported ronald reagan in his presidential bid 
abernathy suffered a stroke in 1983 and underwent brain bypass 
surgery at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore after he recovered 
he returned to preach at west hunter where he had been pastor 
since 1961 and backed jesse jackson in his 1984 presidential bid 
when abernathy mentioned kings relationships with women in his 
book he became the first of kings inner circle to do so even 
though the matter had been chronicled by several noted biographers 
black leaders asked abernathy to retract the passages and 
insinuated that his memory had been impaired by the strokes and 
brain surgery but abernathy whom king praised as his closest 
friend and confidant insisted the accounts were true 
abernathy born march 11 1926 in linden ala was kings 
righthand man for 13 years sharing jail cells with him traveling 
with him and advising him 
we were known as the civil rights twins abernathy once 
recalled we always sought to complement each other i never 
tried to be a copy of him and he never tried to be a copy of me 
it was abernathy who comforted king as he lay dying of a bullet 
wound on the balcony of the lorraine motel in memphis tenn on 
april 4 1968 he took care of various funeral details for mrs 
king and delivered the eulogy 
although he worked helped found the civil rights movement stood 
at kings side through the great battles and went to jail as often 
as king did abernathy consistently found himself in kings shadow 
and it bothered him 
in a 1986 interview he lamented that once when he visited a 
school in connecticut not a single student knew who i was 
in his autobiography abernathy said he felt other king aides 
saw him as no more than an appendage to martin someone who 
served as a part companion part bodyguard but who never played an 
important role in the decisions that affected the direction of the 
movement 
the book uproar tore a hole in the already fragile relationship 
abernathy had with his movement colleagues a relationship that had 
been rather cool after abernathys endorsement of reagan 
at a 1985 dinner he was praised by top black leaders as an 
unsung hero of the civil rights movement four years later he 
was handed a telegram signed by most of his movement 
contemporaries that said the accounts about king in his 
autobiography could rob you of your rightful place in history 
hosea williams who also endorsed reagan branded his longtime 
friend a judas for writing about kings relationships with 
women 
abernathy never took back his allegations im not judas he 
said i know who i am 
abernathy is survived by his wife juanita two sons kwame and 
state rep ralph david abernathy iii and two daughters juandalynn 
and donzaleigh

the national labor relations board does not 
have to asssume that strikebreakers oppose union representation 
the supreme court ruled tuesday 
by a 54 vote the high court overturned an appeals court in a 
texas case and upheld the boards policy of refusing to make a 
presumption of antiunion views by strikebreakers 
curtin matheson scientific inc was hit by a labor strike in 
1979 by workers at its houston warehouse after a contract expired 
and the company locked out the 27 teamsters union members who 
worked there 
five of the 27 workers crossed the picket line when the strike 
began the company 12 days later hired 29 new employees to replace 
the remaining 22 strikers 
when the union later offered to end the strike under terms 
previously offered by management curtin matheson management 
withdrew the offer along with its recognition of the teamsters as 
the employees bargaining agent 
the federal labor board in 1987 ruled that the company illegally 
withdrew its union recognition the board said the company acted 
without adequate reason to believe the teamsters lacked support 
from a majority of the plants workers 
upholding that position and returning the case to the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals justice thurgood marshal wrote for the 
majority tuesday replacements may in some circumstances desire 
union representation despite their willingness to cross the picket 
line in addition a replacement like a nonstriker or a 
strike crossover may disagree with the purpose or strategy of the 
particular strike and refuse to support that strike while still 
wanting that unions representation at the bargaining table 
joining marshall were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices william j brennan byron r white and john paul stevens 
justices harry a blackmun antonin scalia sandra day oconnor 
and anthony m kennedy dissented

health officials said tuesday they 
will ask a judge to order a religious sect to halt construction on 
a fallout shelter where more than 30000 gallons of fuel has leaked 
from buried tanks 
david niss an attorney with the department of health and 
environmental sciences said after a meeting in helena with gov 
stan stephens and state regulators that the state will seek a court 
order this week 
the 31000 gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline leaked from three 
of 35 buried tanks at the fallout shelter complex of the church 
universal and triumphant a new age religious sect that warns of 
the possibility of imminent catastrophe 
niss said the court order would cover both the main shelter 
complex at corwin springs five miles north of yellowstone national 
park and about 45 smaller fallout shelters at the churchowned 
subdivision of glastonbury near emigrant mont about 20 miles to 
the north 
he said the state also will issue an emergency administrative 
order requiring the church to empty remove and inspect all 35 
underground storage tanks at the corwin springs site 
the order will direct the church to turn over all information on 
how every storage tank on church property was installed niss said 
we believe that weve done everything that we were asked by 
the state to do and we will continue to do it said church 
spokesman murray steinman our essential message is were going 
to cooperate cooperate cooperate 
officials have said they believe the churchs decision to bury 
the tanks during the winter resulted in ruptures as the frozen 
ground began to thaw and shift 
the governor said he shared those concerns if all tanks were 
improperly installed in one area its a reasonable assumption that 
the same method was used at other sites stephens said 
the spill brought members of a us environmental protection 
agency emergency response team from denver and helena to monitor 
the cleanup at the churchs headquarters on a mountain ranch on the 
northern boundary of the nations oldest national park 
but state fisheries experts said tuesday that mol heron creek 
an important spawning area for yellowstone cutthroat trout 
apparently has escaped longterm damage so far 
only a small amount of diesel fuel reached the stream last 
friday and since then no new traces have been found in the water 
said glenn phillips pollution control biologist for the department 
of fish wildlife and parks 
phillips said the fuel didnt kill any fish but did wipe out 
about 70 percent of the aquatic insects for about a quartermile 
downstream insects upstream from the spill probably will soon 
recolonize the affected area he said 
the insects including caddis and mayflies are a critical food 
source for both spawning trout and the resident fish population in 
the creek that empties into the yellowstone river he explained 
if we can keep more contaminants out of the stream we can 
probably save the fishery said kl cool department director 
the church installed the underground tanks for 634500 gallons 
of gasoline and diesel fuel as part of a 750person falloutshelter 
complex it is completing at its corwin springs headquarters 
church officials said theyre committed to cleaning up the 
spilled fuel and will excavate and inspect all 35 tanks workers 
were pumping out tanks and loading the fuel into trucks to be taken 
as far away as salt lake city 
steinman said 146500 gallons of fuel had been pumped from the 
storage tanks as of monday night and an additional 40000 was to 
be removed by late tuesday 
no one wants a repeat of this situation said steinman 
everything that can be done is being done 
the group owns about 30000 acres in southern montanas park 
county local officials estimate 2000 to 3000 church members live 
in the scenic mountain valley the church said nobody is living in 
the fallout shelters 
state officials earlier this year reopened an environmental 
review of church developments near corwin springs saying the 
church concealed construction of the shelter complex during the 
original review a year ago 
reporters still have not been allowed by the church to view the 
fallout shelter site or the spill cleanup

two canadian fighter jets 
collided over this southwestern german city during the early 
evening rush hour tuesday killing one of the pilots and showering 
sections of karlsruhe with flaming debris officials said 
the second pilot suffered two broken heels after he ejected from 
the singleseat f18 and parachuted onto a busy highway and at 
least two people on the ground were also hurt police and canadian 
authorities said 
officials earlier said the pilot landed on the highway in his 
ejection seat but police corrected that to say the pilot 
parachuted after bailing out of the cockpit 
reports that the pilot was struck by a car on the a5 autobahn 
proved inaccurate officials said 
maj john paul macdonald spokesman for canadian forces in lahr 
said the planes collided at about 9800 feet while on a training 
mission 
burning debris ripped from the canadian air force f18s during 
the collision rained down on many karlsruhe streets with west 
german television quoting witnesses as saying the engine of one jet 
smashed into a building near a gas station 
we were lucky it wasnt worse because the crash occurred 
during rush hour police spokesman manfred frey said 
west german television said the ejectionseat parachute of the 
pilot who died apparently failed to open after the 410 pm 
collision 
the television reports showed badly damaged cars that had been 
struck by aircraft debris while parked in karlsruhe 
debris was spread across many kilometers miles said the 
zdf television network 
the two wrecked aircraft crashed in areas that were sparsely 
settled setting off small brush fires police said fire officials 
and police rushed to extinguish the blazes 
chunks of an aircraft engine struck the ground in front of a 
busy train station in this city of 285000 residents officials 
said 
luckily damage on the ground was minimal said a police 
spokesman 
zdf said there were initial reports of exploding ammunition at 
the sites where the two planes came down but canadian air force 
officials said there were no munitions on board the craft 
macdonald said the planes crashed south of karlsruhe 
in canada the father of the victim told canadian press that his 
son capt timothy kirk leuty 30 was nearing the end of his 
3year stint in west germany as a member of the 439th squadron 
based in badensoellingen 
we were really looking forward to his coming home stan 
leuty said from his home in meaford ontario he was due to leave 
in june and he was going to be based in cold lake alberta when he 
got back 
the other pilot capt reginald decoste 35 of jonquiere 
quebec ejected safely and landed on a highway breaking both 
heels he was listed in good condition in an area hospital 
macdonald said 
police identified the aircraft as americanmade they had taken 
off from badensoellingen air base near rastatt about 25 miles 
southwest of karlsruhe police said the canadian air force has 48 
f18s at the base 
thousands of canadian soldiers are stationed in west germany as 
part of a multinational nato force they routinely take part in 
allied military manuevers including air training 
the crash was bound to rekindle a debate over the dozens of 
military training flights crisscrossing west germanys skies each 
day 
the debate picked up steam after a series of deadly crashes in 
1988 more recently west germans have said they would like to see 
the training missions sharply curtailed as eastwest relations

cuba and the soviet union signed agreements 
tuesday calling for an 87 percent increase in trade and no cuts in 
cubas important sugar exports the official news agency prensa 
latina reported 
prensa latina said in a dispatch monitored in mexico city that 
the agreements call for about 142 billion in trade this year 
between the two nations previous trade figures were not given 
a highlevel soviet delegation has been in havana since thursday 
to negotiate the accords 
cuban vice president rafael rodriguez told the official cuban 
news service that the agreements signify an advance and 
consolidation of relations 
some news reports have suggested the soviets intended to impose 
harsh conditions on cuba whose hardline leadership is opposed to 
economic and political reform 
this campaign has dissipated like foam because the relations 
maintained during these days confirm the friendship and the 
unalterable principles that govern relations between the soviet 
union and cuba rodriguez was quoted as saying 
the agreements signed by rodriguez and leonid abalkin soviet 
vice president and head of the delegation cover energy grain 
spare parts food and prime materials prensa latina said 
cuba will maintain the amounts of sugar nickel and citrus fruit 
that it sends to the soviets and will also begin supplying them 
with medicine and medical equipment prensa latina said 
the report did not specify quantities or prices 
cuba depends on the soviet union for 70 percent of its foreign 
trade investment in major industrial projects and other economic 
help 
in 1989 the soviet union bought more than half of cubas sugar 
production or 45 million tons prensa latina has said other 
purchases included nickel cobalt and citrus that accounted for 40 
percent of the soviet supply 
cuba is a holdout to the economic and political reforms that 
have been sweeping the soviet bloc as his allies in eastern europe 
have fallen to reformminded governments cuban president fidel 
castro has steadfastly kept a hardline position

the international press institute protested on 
tuesday to the turkish government about its news coverage 
restrictions on the kurdish unrest in southeastern turkey 
institute director peter galliner said he sent a message to 
turkish president turgut ozal urging his government to 
immediately repeal this harsh legislation which effectively 
abolishes press freedom in the region 
turkish newspapers were banned last week from printing stories 
or analyses that might harm military operations in the 11 
southeastern provinces where kurdish guerrillas have been fighting 
for an independent kurdistan 
about 2500 civilians guerrillas and security forces have died 
in the clashes tied to the drive for independence by the kurdish 
labor party a marxist group that has camps in neighboring syria 
iraq and iran 
according to the institute the new regulations are targeted 
against what authorities describe as publications that give 
distorted information about activities in the region as well as 
false reports and comments about the kurdish insurrection 
the independent institute with offices in london and zurich 
claims representation of leading publishers and editors in more 
than 60 countries 
it is a gross violation of basic and internationally 
recognized human rights and therefore can only do irreparable 
damage to the reputation of turkey throughout the world he said

californias agriculture chief tuesday ordered medfly spraying 
in a commercial agricultural region for the first time and 
officials in florida plan to set traps after one of the 
cropdestroying insects was found in a net 
southern california is seriously infested by the mediterranean 
fruit fly and spraying is taking place over more than 400 square 
miles of los angeles orange and now riverside counties 
on monday a third medfly was found in san bernardino county and 
a male medfly was discovered near floridas miami international 
airport 
the medfly in california raised particular concern because it 
signaled the insects first direct threat against a southern 
california commercial agricultural region 
in addition to the pesticide spray order state food and 
agriculture director henry voss filed a request for a previously 
announced quarantine on crops grown over 84 square miles of 
riverside county 
the quarantine the first on commercial crops in this 
infestation would prohibit transportation out of the area of 
fruits and vegetables that have not been fumigated against the 
medfly 
fumigated crops can be sold in the united states but some 
foreign countries most notably japan wont buy treated fruits and 
vegetables said larry cooper spokesman for the state medfly 
project 
the mediterranean fruit fly is considered to be one of the 
most serious agricultural pests in the world said richard clark 
director of the miami medfly project its known to attack over 
250 different types of fruits and vegetables 
the last medfly discovered in florida was found in 1988 it 
turned out to be the sole one found clark said 
workers plan to add about 1700 traps to some 3000 already in 
dade county the traps will be checked daily for any of the pests 
clark said 
eggs from the adult female medfly hatch into larvae which feed 
on fruit and vegetables 
the insect originated in africa and spread to the south pacific 
and central america scientists say it was discovered in florida 
in 1929 and has been eradicated from the state several times by 
spraying infested areas

a federal judge sided with an environmental group 
in ruling that the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant violated 
federal laws for a decade by storing residue from incinerated 
plutoniumtainted waste without a permit 
government officials said the ruling shouldnt cause any 
immediate changes at the plant or affect plans for rocky flats to 
resume plutonium processing operations later this year 
at issue in the sierra clubs lawsuit was whether residue from 
the burning of plutoniumtainted rags trash and solvents required 
a federal permit us district judge lewis t babcock ruled that 
it does 
in the ruling issued last week and distributed by the sierra 
club on monday babcock said that since november 1980 the 
department of energy has been obligated but has failed to 
apply for a key environmental permit for residue wastes at rocky 
flats which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
the resource conservation and recovery act prohibits the 
treatment storage or disposal of hazarous wastes without a permit 
from the us environmental agency or a state authorized to grant 
the permit babcock said in the ruling 
this takes a big step toward making clear what they can and 
cannot store and what is and is not hazardous waste said maggie 
fox of the sierra club they basically incinerated materials 
under the guise of recycling when it was a wastedisposal 
technique 
babcocks ruling probably will have no effect on federal 
decisions to resume plutonium operations at rocky flats which has 
been shut down for several months while the plant tries to meet 
environmental and safety guidelines said department of energy 
spokeswoman cathy kaliniak 
right now we are on track and proceeding through the 
agreement we reached with the state said kaliniak 
the energy department and the state signed an agreement on the 
issue last november the plant is operated by egampg inc for the 
energy department which took control of the plant away from 
longtime plant operator rockwell international corp last december 
john haggard director of the colorado department of healths 
rocky flats program said tuesday the ruling will have little 
effect on the states regulation of the plants waste disposal 
rocky flats stores 1250 cubic yards of radioactive residue at 
the plant 16 miles northwest of denver without a permit most of 
the residue is from an incinerator used to burn the disputed waste 
which was shut down last august as a result of the lawsuit 
plant officials have argued for years that the residue was 
exempt for environmental regulations because it was being stored to 
recycle radioactive plutonium from the ash but court records show 
that plutonium actually was recovered from less than 10 percent of 
the residue 
the sierra club said the ruling means rocky flats now is storing 
more radioactive waste than colorado legally allows 
state and federal officials had agreed rocky flats would store 
no more than 1601 cubic yards of waste consisting of plutonium 
mixed with other hazardous substances such as industrial solvents 
rocky flats now has 1094 cubic yards of the waste 
sierra club attorney adam babich said babcocks ruling means 
mixed waste and the residue from burning are essentially the same 
under the law he said when the two waste sources are combined 
rocky flats has 2344 cubic yards far more than the 
1601cubicyard limit 
but fred dowsett of the state health department said the two 
wastes cannot be added together he said the agreement the state 
reached with the energy deparment last november calls for residue 
wastes to be treated as a separate issue 
babcock said in his ruling that the doestate agreement was 
indefinite in many respects he noted that the agreement allows 
the doe not the state health department to define which are 
residue wastes 
this may be an agreement to agree which is really no agreement 
at all babcock wrote second the deadlines are flexible 
indeed there is no deadline for compliance

solidarity is holding its first congress 
in nine years but what should be a triumphant occasion comes at a 
time when the onceoutlawed trade union and its leader find their 
popularity dropping 
the unions second national congress which opens thursday is 
taking place amid the backdrop of the dramatic changes that have 
swept away communist regimes throughout eastern europe 
the sixday congress is being held just a year after solidarity 
regained its legal status april 17 1989 following months of 
negotiations between the opposition and polands thencommunist 
government the union had been outlawed after the december 1981 
imposition of martial law 
the union now has friends throughout eastern europe but its 
popularity at home has apparently diminished because of harsh 
austerity measures introduced by the new solidarityled government 
a poll released tuesday by the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta 
wyborcza reflected a dramatic shift 
walesas approval rating dropped from 90 percent in november to 
56 percent in march and support for solidarity fell from 78 
percent to 47 percent during the same period according to the poll 
taken by the governmentrun opinion research center 
in comparison to november when the public mood was at its 
highest all those who owed their support to the general faith and 
trust in solidarity have lost some of it gazeta wyborcza said 
walesa the shipyard electrician who won the nobel peace prize 
for his leadership of solidarity is expected to win reelection as 
union chairman although he is likely to face at least token 
opposition in the voting saturday 
walesa is an institution as chairman of the union he 
automatically strengthens its power and position lech kaczynski 
a presidium member of the unions national executive commission 
told a news conference last week 
a critical issue facing the delegates is whether the union 
should largely confine itself to breadandbutter issues defending 
workers interests or get more involved in politics 
one issue likely to emerge during the congress is whether to 
create a solidaritylinked political party 
in an interview published monday in the government newspaper 
rzeczpospolita walesa said his chief goal for solidarity is 
turning it into a trade union and opening up the political 
arena to other forces 
walesa said he wants to distance the union from the 
solidaritybacked government led by prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki a former union journalist and adviser 
the congress will provide the unions first opportunity to pass 
collective judgment on the mazowiecki governments economic reform 
program it includes austerity measures that are bringing 
unemployment to workers in staterun industries they are the same 
people who created solidarity during nationwide strikes in august 
1980 
the government has lifted price controls cut subsidies to 
industries and forced unprofitable factories to close as part of 
its program to transform the centrally controlled socialist system 
to a marketdriven capitalist economy 
while a recent government report shows the inflation rate 
dropped from 786 percent for january to 47 percent for march 
unemployment rose from 56000 in january to 267000 at the end of 
march 
solidaritybacked candidates won overwhelmingly in june 
parliamentary elections that cleared the way for setting up the 
east blocs first noncommunist government in august 
but as a trade union solidarity has lagged in signing up 
members 
the union has registered 22 million members since regaining its 
legal status or only about onefifth of the 10million membership 
solidarity claimed when it held its first congress in 1981 
that first congress took place amid a barrage of hostile 
propaganda from polands communist authorities and the governments 
of neighboring soviet bloc countries 
solidarity at that time was the east blocs only independent 
trade union and was engaged in a struggle with the ruling polish 
communist party the party was secretly gearing up for the 
imposition of military rule two months later most of the delegates 
spent christmas in internment camps 
when the 487 delegates assemble this time in the same olivia 
sports hall in the baltic port of gdansk solidaritys birthplace 
they will be joined by mazowiecki and other government and 
parliamentary leaders from the unions ranks 
also present will be independent trade unionists from other east 
european countries that in the past year have also rejected 
oneparty communist rule 
solidarity leaders say the congress represents the end of the 
unions rebuilding phase 
delegates were chosen in local and regional union elections that 
began last fall 
last week walesa indicated he planned to run for president of 
poland but quickly retracted the statement 
referring monday in rzeczpospolita to complaints he is using the 
union office as a stepping stone to the presidency walesa replied 
it would be well if the president were to come from the bottom 
and if he is with solidarity in his heart 
but he added that he is not actively seeking the office

sony corp announced tuesday it would invest 
300 million to renovate part of a mothballed volkswagen assembly 
plant to produce television picture tubes and eventually 
highdefinition tvs 
the move a major expansion aimed at bringing the japanese 
electronic giants us manufacturing capability closer to its 
suppliers comes at a time of increasing competition and friction 
between the united states and foreign business 
state and federal lawmakers praised the move as an opportunity 
not only to bring more jobs to the semirural western pennsylvania 
area but also to help chip away at the huge us trade deficit with 
japan 
masaaki morita chairman of sony corp of america said the 
lease from the state of the 600acre parcel 45 miles southeast of 
pittsburgh was one of the largest single investments that sony 
has made in a factory and a major investment in sonys future 
with impact beyond the region and the us market 
weak sales forced the closing of the volkswagen of america inc 
plant in july 1988 
the shutdown caused layoffs of about 2500 workers and hard 
feelings among state and local officials who arranged a 70 million 
loan to the west german automaker for completing the facility and 
related roads and railways at its peak in 1980 the plant employed 
5700 people 
to take over the sprawling factory the state is forgiving 40 
million still owed by vw from a 70 million loan taken from the 
state in 1976 to complete a partially built chrysler corp plant 
train workers and build a railroad spur and highway gov robert p 
casey said 
sony estimates about 1000 jobs mainly in higherskilled fields 
such as engineering will be created over the next three years by 
its sixth us plant 
morita said sony which already has a picturetube plant in san 
diego decided to locate in pennsylvania to be closer to key 
suppliers and markets in the central and eastern united states 
we believe we must make the product in the market where we 
sell it he said sonys tv business in the united states is 
growing while at the same time the market trend is toward larger 
and larger screen sizes 
other recent us manufacturing ventures by sony include the 
acquisition of a semiconductor chip production plant in san antonio 
from advanced micro devices inc and the production of laser video 
discs through an indianabased subsidiary 
sony hopes to begin producing 32inch tv tubes by the end of 
1992 for domestic and export sales it aims to manufacture about 1 
million tubes within the first year of production and 15 million 
in the next two years officials said 
highdefinition television sets which feature exceptionally 
clear pictures also will be made at the plant after the us 
government formulates hdtv standards in 1993 said kunitake ando 
president of sony engineering and manufacturing of america 
pennsylvania agreed to provide sony with 235 million in 
lowinterest loans and jobtraining grants to develop half of the 
1200acre site 
the company also plans to lease two additional parcels of 200 
acres each for the possible development of an additional plant 
within the next five years sony also can sublease the sites to 
companies such as glass and cabinet makers involved in the 
production of other television components 
us sen john heinz iii rpa said sonys decision to locate 
in pennsylvania advances efforts to reduce trade friction between 
the united states and japan 
he said he promised moritas brother akio sonys chairman and 
chief executive officer that a direct investment by sony here in 
this area one that created jobs would be seen not only as a 
positive step in reducing that trade imbalance but would be 
applauded and welcomed enthusiastically

ringleader of a white gang says the mob assembled to protect their 
turf 
in the videotape broadcast on wabctv five days after the aug

gathered to battle a gang of blacks they believed were coming 
looking for trouble in their mostly white brooklyn neighborhood 
i was told that 25 blacks were coming to beat me and my 
friends up mondello said the only reason baseball bats were 
on the scene was because we wanted to protect ourselves and we 
didnt know if they were going to be armed

gun and said the attack was not racially motivated 
no matter what color they were if someone was coming to beat 
my friends up we would do anything to protect ourselves mondello

19yearold defendant was a liar who had changed his account of the 
attack 
i dont buy that wideeyed innocence thats on the tape 
paul burns an assistant district attorney said outside the 
courtroom take a look at what he said to the police and what he 
said on the tape

cuba escalating its resistance to us 
governmentsponsored broadcasting jammed radio marti early tuesday 
for the first time since tv marti went on the air 
cuba continued to jam the latenight test signal of tv marti 
which began broadcasting march 27 
were pretty sure they jammed radio marti just during the 
time tv marti was on the air said antonio navarro acting 
director of both services for the voice of america 
in a communique monitored in miami cuba denounced radio marti 
as an instrument of psychological war and disinformation aimed 
at overthrowing fidel castros regime according to a story 
published in wednesdays miami herald 
the cuban government has said that tv marti its signal sent 
from an antenna aboard a balloon off the south florida coast 
constitutes an aggressive action and violates cuban sovereignty 
in a speech earlier this month castro implied that one of the 
moves under consideration in retaliation to the tv marti broadcasts

two of washingtons most famous landmarks the 
lincoln and jefferson memorials are slowly crumbling under the 
ravaging effects of water seepage air pollution littering 
tourists and a pesky little bug called the midge experts say 
private consultants hired by the national park service say the 
most glaring problem was found at the 68yearold lincoln memorial 
where dripping rainwater has caused deterioration of huge concrete 
slabs that support a broad cobblestone walkway and the grassy 
terrace surrounding the building 
at the jefferson memorial completed in 1943 cracks have been 
detected in the concrete shell of the inner dome officials also 
are worried that the main plaza and marble steps may be sliding 
gradually into the waters of the tidal basin 
the park service said none of the problems is serious enough to 
require immediate attention or pose a safety hazard to visitors

experts are almost evenly divided about 
whether the federal government is taking too much money away from 
cancer heart disease and other medical studies to support aids 
research according to a survey by the office of technology 
assessment 
the ota survey released tuesday said most of the experts also 
believe aids research has made many important contributions to 
advances in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and that 
virtually every medical speciality has benefited to some degree 
from money spent on aids studies 
federal spending for treatment and prevention of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome totals about 29 billion for the fiscal year 
that ends this october research into the human immunodeficiency 
virus which causes aids is about 116 billion 
critics of rising expenditures on hiv disease point out that 
hiv funding has exceeded funding for heart disease and rivals 
funding for cancer despite the much greater number of deaths from 
these latter diseases the ota report said it said about 10 
percent of the total national institutes of health 1990 budget goes

researchers say they have pinpointed for the 
first time a gene that may make people prone to alcoholism adding 
weight to the argument that alcoholism is a disease and not a moral 
weakness 
government scientists called the finding provocative and 
promising even if it requires more study but a leading 
investigator in the field declared it was impossible to say an 
alcohol gene had been identified 
the researchers reported in wednesdays journal of the american 
medical association that they found a particular gene on a 
chromosome previously linked with alcoholism to be far more common 
in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics if verified the finding 
would represent the first specific identification of a genetic root 
for alcoholism 
alcoholism which afflicts an estimated 18 million americans 
tends to run in families and previous studies of families and of 
adopted twins have suggested that environment and genetic factors

john mcnaughton calls his film henry 
portrait of a serial killer a cautionary tale but the 
ratings board said caution wasnt enough and gave it an xrating 
now serial killer is reaching a few of the countrys movie 
screens after a tortuous fiveyear journey because of the 
xrating which means moviegoers under 17 can not be admitted only 
a handful of theaters will exhibit the film and few newspapers will 
accept ads yet the film has earned decent reviews for mainstream 
critics 
john mcnaughton 50 is a quietspoken chicago filmmaker who 
left his ad agency business to tour with a carnival then returned 
to pursue his longtime interest in video and film he was making 
commercials when he was approached by waleed and malik ali to make 
a horror film for their mpi home video 
mcnaughton readily agreed as he was searching for a subject he 
met his friend richard fire a chicago playwright here look at 
this said fire playing the tape of an interview on abcs 
2020 with texas mass murderer henry lee lucas 
it took about 30 seconds for it to sink in my god this is 
true deep horror that this guy could go out and do those things 
one of the things that got through to me was that henry had this 
lowkey charm in the way he talked he had the ability to be 
charming in his own strange way and had the ability to get close 
enough to people to slaughter them mcnaughton said 
fire and mcnaughton wrote the script closely following the 
lucas case for the vital role of the murderer the director chose 
michael rooker an outgoing family man who was painting houses 
while hunting for acting jobs he has since appeared in eight men 
out mississippi burning and music box 
henry was filmed in chicago during a fourweek period in 
late 1985 the budget 100000 
the original intent of the film was for homevideo release 
only says mcnaughton those of us on the film were keeping our 
fingers crossed that it would turn out well enough to get a 
theatrical release 
the ali brothers sent the film to a number of distributors no 
interest mcnaughton began his own campaign showing it in 1986 at 
the chicago film festival where it stirred good comment vestron 
co people saw the film at a new york screening and made an offer 
vestron was very healthy at the time and they were ready to 
send it to theaters and home video says mcnaughton but the 
companys lawyers became skittish about the depiction of reallife 
figures and the deal evaporated 
meanwhile mcnaughton was hired to direct the borrower for 
atlantic releasing which also took on henry in late 1987 
then the mpaa gave it an xrating and atlantic walked away 
from the deal he said i think atlantic was going to take it 
into 400 to 600 theaters the marketability because of the xrating 
is cut down to maybe 25 to 30 theaters maybe one arthouse per 
city so it becomes commercially unviable for a company like 
atlantic 
the objection of the ratings board of the motion picture 
association was to the excessive violence mcnaughton could see no 
way to make cuts in an already tightly edited film 
often a film is like a house of cards pull out one and the 
house collapses he said 
henry reverted to mpi where a marketer became enthused and 
lined up screenings with film societies and film festivals the 
glowing reviews attracted a small distributor filmcat based in 
las vegas mcnaughton has been on the road to attract attention to 
his movie since films and tv ads are unavailable 
while in los angeles he has been talking to major companies 
about future projects 
well see what happens he said cautiously under the 
concept of heat as its practiced in this town i should have a 
month or so of heat i hope it develops into paying work which is 
what i sorely need at this moment

according to legend and song home used to be 
sweet and it still can be if you are able to withstand the 
pressure its constant 
the latest terrorizer of the homeowner and of renters too is 
the telemarketer often a bank or an insurance agent who believes 
the dinner hour is the time to make a telephone sales pitch 
the audacity of such sales people is magnified many times when 
you consider how difficult it is to sell anything to someone who 
left a plate of roast beef or chicken on the table and who probably 
still has some in the mouth 
they try however and presumably they occasionally succeed due 
to the law of numbers but they can create havoc in the home 
befouling the ideal of it being a place of rest relaxation 
security peace and love 
by the million and one standards of insurers there is no home 
or person in america adequately insured for accident ill health 
life property by brokeragehouse standards none is properly 
invested in stocks either 
while you might find yourself adequately prepared to ward off 
the pitches they leave you with doubts the nagging kind the 
guilty kind that erode your resistance and set you up for an 
eventual collapse and purchase 
while telemarketers are occasional interruptions there are 
constant ones too rarely is the homeowner safely guarded against 
hearing or reading about rising interest rates collapsing home 
prices and forced sales 
you might say that alleged studies supporting such contentions 
are a staple of some academics that they sometimes come from wall 
street analysts who might understand stocks but not houses and 
that they always find a media outlet 
many of them are poorly done including one by a harvard 
university professor and his assistant who forecast a long steady 
decline in prices of existing homes but whose methodology has been 
demonstrated as naive 
why is the homeowner the focus of so much attention because 
homeowners have money and worries money can buy the goods and 
worry about protecting the house can be a very good sales opener 
there is no limit to the problems that can be created and the 
solutions offered 
you found a leak you say its insignificant no leak is 
insignificant slowly and without letup it is doing damage inside 
your wall unseen until it suddenly erupts in a cascade of 
destruction plumbers will tell you so 
maybe you think you should fill up the fuel oil tank you 
buried in the backyard prices might be lower in summer you said 
buried is it metal how do you know its not rusting and befouling 
your well 
better check the well if you live in the city better check 
your water anyway sure you might find strange chemicals there 
but they can be taken care of reasonably give or take a few 
hundred dollars 
there is no retreat from these problems they must be faced 
even if you think you can hide from them 
you might go out on the lawn pictured on grass seed boxes as a 
serene place but you know you will find work to be done besides 
have you considered all the chemical youve dumped on that lawn 
and that more and more rashes and respiratory problems are being 
reported and that you could get lyme disease 
you may try retreating to the cellar but youve heard there 
could be radon gas there the attic what if you find termites at 
home wouldnt it be better if you just didnt know 
you could if you wish climb to the roof and meditate nobody 
is likely to bother you there except perhaps a neighbor who calls 
the authorities aside from that how do you know its safe up 
there 
the reason for the question is that theres that fireretardant 
plywood you know that some builders used on roofs and the word 
is that some of it deteriorates and crumbles under the least 
pressure 
how can you be sure it wont just dump you down into the living 
room amid all those other problems 
home what a terrifying place

two thieves shot yeh yungchuan to death 
in front of other investors as he left the trading floor of a 
brokerage house with nearly 100000 crime has come to taiwan on 
the heels of affluence 
yeh a 32yearold accountant turned to run when the men 
stopped him they shot him once in the back and once in the head 
took his 25 million taiwan dollars and fled on a motorcycle parked 
outside 
such brutal crimes are becoming common wealthy businessmen hire 
guards and use bulletproof cars 
taiwan is not safe anymore said rebecca yen a 28yearold 
employee of a trading company most of my friends plan to 
emo australia new zealand and canada 
tai estimated that about 40000 taiwanese left in 1989 up from 
30000 in 1988 
luxury cars seen as invitations to kidnapping and robbery no 
longer are in demand 
eric fang assistant sales manager of the largest mercedesbenz 
agency said his company sold only 290 cars in december down from 
the 1988 monthly average of 650 and predicted a drop in sales of 
15 percent for 1990 
many businessmen have postponed purchases because they do not 
want to drive the dangerous cars he said 
authorities report a dramatic increase in smuggled guns from 
china police said they seized 687 chinesemade shotguns last year 
up from 57 in 1988 
official statistics say smuggled chinese guns were used in 91 
killings in 1987 including those of four policemen 
premier lee huan has proclaimed 1990 anticrime year and 
proposed that gun possession now punishable by 10 years in prison 
be made a capital crime 
thousands of inexpensive guns are believed to be in the hands of 
gangsters some legislators say the only way to stop the influx 
from the mainland is for the government to hold direct talks with 
beijing 
the ruling nationalists fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to the communists and still refuse to negotiate directly 
with the beijing government 
lin chiacheng a sociology professor at soochow university 
believes one reason for the crime wave is the widened gap between 
the rich and the poor 
taiwans exportled economic boom has made its per capita gross 
national product the fourth highest in asia but good fortune has 
not been shared equally the income of the top 20 percent is nearly 
five times that of the bottom 20 percent 
people also seem more inclined to seek quick riches than to work 
for a better life stock speculation has been the favored tactic 
but many have turned to crime 
traditional values have faded lin said fewer people 
believe in hard work and saving most envy those who have gotten 
wealthy fast from speculating and some think it is all right to 
get money from those rich people

many latin american banks pay high 
returns but the risks are just as great money doubled every month 
in brazil until march when the government froze all accounts 
such uncertainty is one reason latin americans are believed to 
have more than 200 billion in switzerland the bahamas miami and 
elsewhere 
latin leaders are encouraging citizens to bring their money 
home but bitter memories and recent government actions bode ill 
for success 
on his first day in office last month president fernando collor 
de mello of brazil put an 18month freeze on 115 billion in 
personal and corporate checking savings and money market accounts 
and bank certificates of deposit 
he said the drastic liquidity reduction was needed to halt 
annual inflation of 4853 percent in latin americas largest 
country 
argentina mexico bolivia peru and chile have decreed economic 
plans that disrupted the lives of ordinary savers and for the most 
part frustrated government efforts to persuade citizens to invest 
in their own countries 
brazils policy allows withdrawls of up to 1200 from checking 
and savings accounts and 600 or 20 percent of the balance 
whichever is greater for moneymarket accounts mutual funds and 
cds 
collor de mello said he was after big speculators but 
millions of middle class brazilians saw their plans for new cars or 
down payments on homes suddenly canceled 
theres no doubt that the measures seriously affected peoples 
confidence in the local savings and banking system said 
consultant carlos geraldo langoni a former central bank president 
they furthered the belief that for latin americans the only 
real financial protection is the us dollar or some other strong 
currency he said in an interview 
on the other hand brazil could not go on with fourdigit 
inflation if the new economic plan meets with total success maybe 
it will erase the trauma 
clarice pechman a leading expert on foreign exchange estimates 
brazilians have more than 40 billion outside the country 
brazilians traditionally easygoing have tried to make the best 
of things jokes have sprung up as they often do in tough times 
when an alligator was discovered in a pond at the quinta da boa 
vista park in rio residents named it zelia because of its big 
bite the economy minister who announced the freezing of 
accounts is zelia cardoso de mello no relation to the president 
the government said the restrictions applied only to new 
cruzados the money that existed before mar 16 it promised 
nothing would happen to cruzeiros the currency introduced on that 
date and urged people to open cruzeiro accounts 
a branch manager of bradesco a large private bank said are 
you kidding all people want to do is take their money out he 
asked that his name not be used 
in argentina the government seized about 15 billion worth of 
sevenday highinterest bank cds in january and converted them to 
10year government bonds 
argentines who dont want to wait until 2000 to get their money 
back can sell the bonds for cash but they get only about 30 
percent of the face value 
they robbed me said raul tucci who owns a small buenos 
aires furniture factory he was in line at his bank which offered 
free cups of coffee to its angry customers 
i owe money for wood i bought tucci said i cant pay it i 
have to close the factory and lay off my 50 workers who wants 
coffee i want my money 
pedro gianbaggi a businessman said never again will i put 
my money in a bank he was allowed to withdraw only 1 million 
australs about 500 from his blocked certificates of deposit 
lucia lattuada said the government bonds were good only for 
papering the wall 
in 1982 mexico forcibly converted about 10 billion in us 
dollar accounts to pesos then devalued the peso by 30 percent 
it was horrible said donna rojinsky a us embassy 
spokeswoman 
many mexicans decided it wasnt safe to keep their money at 
home those near the border opened accounts on the american side or 
invested in texas real estate 
unofficial estimates say mexicans have 100 billion outside the 
country but up to 35 billion is said to have returned since 
president carlos salinas de gortari a freemarketeer took office 
in december 1988 peso bank accounts now pay interest of 20 percent 
a year higher than the inflation rate 
bolivia converted dollar accounts to bolivianos the local 
currency in the 1980s and claimed no one lost anything 
that argument was based on the official exchange rate but 
bolivianos officially worth a dollar brought only 10 cents on the 
street bolivian private savings too went abroad 
president alan garcia of peru ordered 900 million in dollar 
accounts converted to peruvian soles in 1985 and the money quickly 
lost value to inflation which reached four digits by 1987 small 
depositors suffered most because the rich had taken their money 
out of the country 
after the chilean military coup of 1973 gen augusto pinochets 
government limited withdrawals from savings accounts to 200 but 
the restriction lasted only two years inflation declined and 
people were allowed to get their money back 
uruguay which permits foreigners to hold dollar accounts is an 
exception to the general rule of banking uncertainty 
of the estimated 60 billion in argentine funds held outside the 
country about 2 billion is thought to be in neighboring uruguay 
residents of buenos aires can visit their money by taking a 
30minute flight or a slightly longer hovercraft ride 
antonio erman gonzalez argentinas economy minister said at an 
april meeting of the interamerican development bank if domestic 
savings go abroad it makes it more difficult for latin american 
countries to attract foreign investment the foreigners see the 
locals taking all their money out of the country 
inconsistent government policy has been a major factor in 
creating the distrust 
under former president jose sarney brazil allowed private banks 
to offer numbered or bearer money market accounts 
those accounts invested heavily in treasury bills and notes in 
part financing the governments inflationary spending the idea was 
that nameless highinterest accounts would be an alternative to 
keeping money in switzerland or elsewhere 
hours after taking office in march collor de mello outlawed all 
bearer accounts

physical and emotional scars persist six 
months after the killer earthquake jolted the san francisco bay 
area but most businesses and residents are back on solid ground 
economic activity has nearly regained its prequake level 
analysts say and estimates of the cost of damage caused by the 
massive temblor have been scaled back 
the damage is widespread nevertheless the elevated section of 
interstate 880 in oakland where 42 people died when the road 
collapsed oct 17 has been dismantled while discussions continue 
about whether to rebuild or reroute it 
the similarly elevated embarcadero freeway stands forlorn near 
downtown san francisco while politicians and business people debate 
whether it should be replaced or rebuilt 
two sections of busy highway 101 in san francisco are under 
repair intensifying rushhour traffic jams and some small 
businesses in hardhit oakland los gatos santa cruz and 
watsonville are still awaiting federal loans for reconstruction and 
inventory replacement 
in downtown oakland where many empty buildings are surrounded 
by chainlink fences the emporium department store isnt expected 
to reopen until august the store suffered more than 10 million in 
damage when display windows shattered stairwells collapsed and the 
exterior brick facade cracked 
small tremors shrugged off or barely noticed by the bay areas 
six million residents before the 71 magnitude quake last fall now 
trigger memories of the tragedy that claimed 68 lives and worries 
about the really big one that geologists say is bound to come 
but the regions economy on the whole has rebounded vigorously 
with no evidence of longterm damage 
from the computer and chip companies in silicon valley to the 
retail and financial giants in san francisco the bay area remains 
one of the most vibrant centers of economic activity in the country 
retail business in san francisco is now about 96 percent of 
normal said deputy mayor james ho thats despite the fact that 
some hardhit sections chinatown north beach south of market 
fishermans wharf and the mission continue to suffer business in 
those areas is down from 8 to 18 percent ho said 
an economic index based on measures of activity in real estate 
retailing services international trade manufacturing and tourism 
for the nine bay area counties shows the regions economy virtually 
recovered from the quake by december after a small dip in october 
and november 
the index compiled by tapan munroe an economist with pacific 
gas amp electric co in san francisco and walter e hoadley a 
hoover institution senior fellow showed the overall strength of a 
diversified economy that had long planned on ways to cope with a 
big quake 
the preparedness paid off munroe said the region fared 
very well in terms of emergency services 
early estimates of 7 billion to 10 billion in damage have been 
scaled down but munroe said the current figure of 56 billion 
from state officials is still too high 
hotel and restaurant owners said their businesses still suffer 
though hotel occupancy rates in san francisco are close to normal 
even after the postquake opening of two new large hotels said 
steve reiser of the accounting firm pannell kerr forster 
passenger arrivals at san francisco international airport were 
off 118 percent in october and 4 percent in november from the same 
months in 1988 but arrivals were up 07 percent in december 
fewer travelers from within the united states are coming to san 
francisco this year because of higher domestic air fares but 
international arrivals are booming said airport spokesman ron 
wilson 
ray brady research director for the association of bay area 
governments in oakland said the region pulled through the quake so 
easily because the economy is decentralized when the bay bridge 
collapse cut traffic in san francisco he noted retail sales went 
up in the east bay so total retail sales in the region remained 
constant 
traffic began rolling over the repaired bay bridge a month after 
its partial collapse and workers are continuing to repair the two 
closed sections of highway 101 
san francisco mayor art agnos wants to replace the embarcadero 
freeway long considered an eyesore with an underground 
expressway the citys board of supervisors approved the plan 
monday night despite a threehour strike by chinatown merchants 
who claim that repairing the existing roadway would be cheaper and 
get business traffic back into the depressed area more quickly

the head of the panel of eastern airlines 
unsecured creditors says the group has lost confidence in the 
ability of the airlines managers to pull the company out of its 
financial troubles 
easterns unsecured creditors were expected to continue pressing 
their case today for a trustee to run the company us bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland meanwhile indicated at a hearing monday 
he did not favor a liquidation of the airline 
alan boyd chairman of the unsecured creditors committee cited 
easterns continuing financial losses and what he called 
managements inability to forecast results with anything close to 
reality 
boyd chairman of airbus industrie of north america also said 
at mondays hearing that easterns management had shown itself 
unable to regain the confidence of the flying public and travel 
agents since a devastating strike more than a year ago 
airbus the jet maker owned by a consortium of european nations 
is one of easterns major suppliers and is owed roughly 100 
million by the airline 
the creditors committee wants lifland to appoint a special 
trustee to take over the management of eastern in place of frank 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp easterns 
management said appointment of a trustee would doom the airline 
the hearing began with a lengthy session last friday eastern 
also is asking the judge for permission to withdraw 80 million 
from an escrow account to cover secondquarter operations 
lorenzo and eastern president phil bakes are expected to testify 
for the company today or later in the week as the hearing continues 
eastern has been attempting to reorganize under bankruptcy court 
protection from creditors but several attempted restructuring 
plans either have failed to win creditor approval or have fallen 
through 
boyd said creditors objected among other things to easterns 
proposal to sell its maintenance facility in miami for about 100 
million because they believed it would remove an integral part of 
easterns operations 
boyd said the committee which had been supportive of easterns 
previous reorganization proposals began to change its attitude 
early this year when the airline proposed cutting debt payments to 
creditors 
the committee lost confidence after eastern said on march 27 
that it no longer could honor an earlier proposal to repay 
unsecured creditors 50 cents for every dollar owed boyd said 
the same day the unsecured creditors passed a resolution to 
seek a trustee to liquidate eastern if texas air didnt agree to 
cover the companys losses since then the committee has shifted 
and said it wants a trustee either to sell the airline as a going 
concern or in parts 
eastern owes the creditors around 980 million preferred 
shareholders who still are seeking to liquidate the airine are 
due 680 million 
bruce zirinsky an attorney for eastern warned monday that 
appointment of a trustee would be one more step toward the 
liquidation of eastern which he said could have serious financial 
consequences to creditors 
however lifland responded that if a trustee were appointed to 
operate eastern it would be someone in the airline industry 
a travel agent appearing as a witness for eastern warned that 
the airline would lose business if a trustee were designated to run 
it 
the word trustee would be equated with liquidation and i for 
one would book away from eastern said richard copeland 
president of the new york chapter of the american society of travel 
agents and the head of hillside travel inc in new york 
the pilots machinists and flight attendants unions struck 
eastern on march 4 1989 forcing the miamibased airline into 
bankruptcy protection five days later the machinists union remains 
on strike 
the unions have sought a trustee almost from the outset they 
claim lorenzo has been bleeding eastern by funneling assets to 
texas air and to continental airlines easterns largely nonunion 
sister carrier 
a report by courtappointed examiner david i shapiro filed in 
early march suggested texas air had victimized eastern by 
underpaying for the airline and some of its assets by hundreds of 
millions of dollars

more than 100000 investors hit by losses at 
eight real estate funds seeking independence from troubled vms 
realty partners are hoping an audit will bring some good news an 
industry analyst says 
the funds involved five real estate investment trusts and 
three publicly traded trusts reported a total of nearly 260 
million in net losses for 1989 on monday 
they were formed as mortgage vehicles to make loans on 
properties mostly commercial that were being developed by vms 
realty partners one of the nations largest real estate companies 
the company announced in february that it was suspending most 
payments to creditors and to the eight funds due to severe cash 
flow problems that analysts said were a sign of the weak real 
estate syndication business 
the funds financial problems were no surprise said barry 
vinocur editor of the stanger register a monthly financial 
magazine on real estate investments published in shrewsbury nj 
the important news will be the results of an analysis of vms 
finances by the accounting firm of coopers amp lybrand vinocur said 
the analysis will study the mortgage loans and underlying 
collateral of all eight funds to determine what dividends if any 
will be paid by the funds 
the issue for these investors is really straightforward he 
said that is whats the value of the assets that these trusts 
and partnerships own 
investors also want to know what is the likelihood that 
current management can maximize the investment that is there he 
said 
vms mortgage investment fund reported the biggest loss of the 
eight 1092 million or 275 a share compared with a 1988 net 
income of 95 million or 73 cents a share 
leonard g levine president of the funds said in a statement 
that the losses included provisions for possible loan losses 
the funds independent board of directors will continue to 
seek to realize the maximum amount possible in connection with its 
mortgage loans he said 
vms realty has managed assets of more than 9 billion including 
highprofile hotels in florida california and hawaii 
after the companys february announcement levine and four other 
vms officers resigned levine was appointed chief of the eight 
funds which are now managed by an independent board of directors 
and are seeking new names 
these developments followed a management shakeup in november 
that put jeffrey j park a former xerox executive in charge of 
vms a xerox subsidiary xerox credit corp owns 25 percent of 
vms vms in november also announced a 110 million writeoff 
the other funds andtheir reported 1989 losses are 
vms mortgage investors limited partnership ii 347 million 
or 275 per unit compared with 1988 net income of 119 million 
or 94 cents a unit

420 a unit compared with 1988 net income of 10 million or 
130 a unit

compared with 1988 net income of 72 million or 74 cents a share

or 171 a unit compared with 1988 net income of 96 million or 
86 cents a share

room temperature 
thats believed by most people in the industry to be the 
technology which will be used to bring lowcost vivid color 
printing dataproducts chairman jack c davis said in a telephone 
interview 
this gives all three of us the ability to be strongly 
positioned said davis who will stay on as chairman reporting 
to a private board made up of officials of the other companies 
under terms of the deal 
hitachi koki which makes electrical equipment and power tools 
and nissei sangyo which makes machinery and light equipment and

hitachi kokis president said in a statement we and nissei 
sangyo respect its reputation technology and management 
last year dpc acquisition pursued an unsolicited 15ashare

fell through dpc was an acquisition group led by john k castle 
the former chief executive of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities a new york investment banking firm 
dataproducts instead announced its own restructuring which 
involved selling its 22acre headquarters property paying a 
special 2ashare dividend eliminating 400 us jobs a fifth of 
its domestic work force and trying to sell a new england 
subsidiary that made heavyduty printers 
the company has struggled to update its products with laser

using engines purchased from toshiba sharp and other japanese 
manufacturers for example dataproducts built a machine capable of 
printing 26 lines per minute hitachi koki on the other hand 
makes printers that can handle up to 135 lines per minute 
in its latest earnings report dataproducts said it lost 41 
million or 21 cents per share for its third fiscal quarter 
compared with a yearearlier profit of 16 million or 8 cents a 
share revenue declined 16 percent from 945 million to 793 
million the company said in the january report 
in the fiscal year ending march 25 1989 it earned 38 million 
on sales of 3534 million down from a 9 million profit a year 
earlier 
hitachi koki had sales last year of 109 billion yen or about 
686 million at current exchange rates nissei sangyos revenues 
were 482 billion yen or 3 billion 
davis said he had been talking with representatives of the other 
companies since the middle of last year in the middle of the 
unwelcome takeover bid by dpc 
the philosophies of the companies are similar in terms of a 
drive for highquality products davis said

lockheed corp chairman daniel tellep held a 
peace lunch with harold simmons the billionaire texan who tried 
but failed to wrest away control of the aerospace company in a 
proxy battle 
mondays meeting was set up after simmons received an invitation 
from tellep more than two weeks ago simmons spokesman largent 
parks said he called the invitation sort of an olivebranch type 
of thing 
the lunch followed a reconvening of the companys annual 
meeting at which lockheed revealed the official tally of votes in 
the proxy battle 
simmons and tellep had no immediate comment on their luncheon 
tellep offered to hold a series of talks with simmons and other 
major lockheed shareholders after lockheeds annual meeting march 
29 
simmons lost a proxy battle for control of lockheeds board that 
culminated at the meeting several big institutional shareholders 
sided with him though leading tellep to make major concessions to 
big shareholders those included a promise to create three new 
board seats for them 
about 120 people mostly lockheed workers and retirees attended 
mondays reconvened meeting which lasted seven minutes at a hotel 
in woodland hills tellep thanked them for supporting him 
as earlier announced simmons nominees for lockheeds board 
were defeated getting slightly less than 40 percent of the votes 
but shareholders rights issues backed by simmons passed 
those included a recommendation that lockheed drop its poison 
pill provision which makes it prohibitively expensive for any 
person or institution to acquire more than 20 percent of lockheeds 
shares 
simmons through his nl industries owns 189 percent of 
lockheeds common stock he paid about 530 million for his shares 
and has a paper loss to date of about 100 million 
simmons had said he wanted to force lockheed to concentrate 
harder on its core businesses he said he would sell assets from 
the technology services and electronics systems groups if they 
could not quickly turn bigger profits 
profits at lockheed the nations sixthlargest military 
contractor fell from 624 million in 1988 to 2 million last year 
that was chiefly because the company took nearly 500 million in 
special charges after underestimating the costs of developing 
several programs such as a submarinehunting plane 
lockheed said holders of 82 percent of its stock 52685008 
shares of the 63192196 shares outstanding had cast votes 
lockheeds directors got from 576 percent to 607 percent of 
the votes 
on other issues 
a recommendation that lockheed adopt confidential voting one 
of the issues on which tellep gave ground passed by 60 percent 
a bylaw amendment exempting lockheed from the tough 
antitakeover provisions of delaware law another measure on which 
tellep flipflopped passed by 61 percent lockheed with 
headquarters in the los angeles suburb of calabasas is 
incorporated in delaware 
the recommendation to overturn the poison pill passed by 54 
percent with 41 percent against and 5 percent abstaining 
excluding shares voted by nl industries which proposed the 
measure it would have lost by a wide margin lockheed said tellep 
has refused to give ground on this issue

yamaichi securities one of japans 17 major 
securities companies said tuesday it faces a loss of 24 million 
due to one customers bankruptcy last month 
yamaichi on orders from a customer late in february bought 3 
million shares or oneseventh of the total outstanding of 
nippon seisen a leading wire maker at the equivalent of about 44 
million for delivery in four days 
yamaichi was supposed to receive 70520 in commission for the 
transaction but the customer an institutional investor failed 
to settle the transaction and went bankrupt on march 30 said 
yamaichi spokesman takao adachi 
meantime he said prices on the tokyo stock market began to 
crash and the price of nippon seisens shares plunged to 654 a 
share on tuesday from 1465 in february 
negotiations for remedy are ongoing if they fail the company 
might bring the case to the court because theres always 
possibility that manipulation might have been involved in a case 
like this adachi said 
manipulation is the act of depressing or raising prices 
artificially so that they do not represent true value this is done 
by creating an appearance of active buying or selling either alone 
or in concert with others the act violates japans securities law 
and is subject to criminal and civil penalties 
adachi said the investor a company operating coffee shops had 
been a good customer for yamaichi during the last two years 
although its earlier investments were made on a smaller scale 
no comment was immediately available from osakabased nippon 
seisen

lastminute tax filers trying to beat uncle sams deadline were 
handed free aspirin in post office lines while others scrambled 
for 11thhour tax shelters a postal worker was injured by a letter 
bomb addressed to tax thieves 
millions of procrastinators produced the usual midnight crowds 
and traffic jams in cities large and small as tax day 1990 drew to 
a close 
an envelope containing a tea bag in apparent reference to the 
tax protest that helped spark the american revolution blew up 
monday night outside the royal oak post office in suburban detroit 
as workers collected tax returns the bomb spewed a red liquid 
a 29yearold postal worker tom berlucchi was treated at a 
hospital for burns on his hands and face authorities said 
a woman dressed as an aspirin bottle handed out samples at the 
post office in chicago and a philadelphia radio station blasting 
rock music from a van gave away stamps at twentieth century 
investors inc in kansas city customers opened more than 130 
individual retirement accounts or iras in three hours 
we even burned out a fax machine getting applications to 
clients out of town said gunnar hughes a twentieth century 
spokesman 
the internal revenue service did not estimate how many taxpayers 
waited until the last minute but the agency predicted about 34 
million returns more than 30 percent of the 111 million expected 
this year would be filed after april 6 
the deadline is usually april 15 but it was a sunday this year 
so the irs delayed it a day 
the irs form 4868 was one of the mostsought pieces of paper in 
the nation as an estimated 6 million americans abandoned hopes of 
meeting the midnight deadline filing a form 4868 along with a 
check for estimated taxes owed extends the deadline to aug 15 
michigan treasurer robert bowman was among the late and bleary 
eyed i always wait until the last minute to do my own taxes 
because i spend the first three months of the year worrying about 
everyone elses but i always get a refund he said 
elliott swinton 27 who was among those in line at a copy 
machine in philadelphia said he did his taxes weeks ago but 
delayed filing them until the last minute we owed money why 
give it to them two months ago he said 
a new york city sales representative 24yearold michael 
alleyne balanced his state form on his knees on the steps of the 
main post office in manhattan 
i mailed the federal form at 930 and then did the state form 
out here on the steps he said but at least i had the envelope 
filled out i didnt procrastinate that part 
dozens of taxpayers in norfolk va are going to have to do 
their taxes over because of two mailbox fires discovered monday 
that postal inspectors think were deliberately set 
sixtyfive tax envelopes were in good enough shape to send on to 
the irs but 37 were too damaged to forward on several the name 
of the taxpayer was destroyed postal workers said 
its all i need said shirley evans when she found out she 
had to redo her burned tax form i think theres a lot of sick 
people in the world who do things like that i have better things 
to do than set a mailbox on fire 
demonstrators mostly those who oppose the use of tax dollars 
for defense or nuclear projects or who oppose paying taxes 
altogether mingled in post office crowds in philadelphia suburban 
atlanta and greenfield mass 
were here to say our taxes are going to the wrong place 
to defense said rich garella 24 of philadelphia 
the people dropping off their taxes here tonight are funding 
the war in el salvador they should be spent on human needs here 
there are people sleeping on grates 
decatur ga postmaster crawford lovett had 15 or 20 tax 
protesters in his domain carrying signs against the use of tax 
dollars to finance nuclear weapons 
one woman was dressed up like an angel carrying a ban the 
bomb sign and a huge american flag then she walks over to my 
employee and hands him her tax return lovett said

the first quarter of 1989 while orders from the companys medical 
systems division were 25 percent ahead of last year

about 34000 union employees of 
american telephone amp telegraph co would be eligible for early 
retirement under a tentative buyout agreement reached between 
unions and management officials from both sides said tuesday 
beginning may 1 the company would add at least three years to 
each workers age and tenure and five years for those workers whose 
jobs are considered obsolete said atampt spokesmkan burke stinson 
workers in the latter category including telephone operators 
would also receive a 15 percent boost in monthly pension payments 
stinson said 
the unions involved are the communications workers of america 
and the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
the proposal follows similar incentives offered last year to 
managers as atampt seeks to trim its workforce and modernize 
operations in the wake of the 1984 breakup of the bell system 
last year 39 percent or 12535 of 32121 managers opted to 
retire early under a plan that added five years to each managers 
age and tenure and boosted pension payments by 15 percent 
ibew spokesman joe penna said the proposal on the table is an 
improvement over an offer rejected by the unions last month atampt 
offered to add five years to each workers age but did not 
increase the size of the pension payments stinson said 
penna said business managers plan to meet next week to discuss 
the proposal about onethird of the eligible workers between 
8000 and 12000 are expected to opt for early retirement penna 
said 
stinson said atampt plans to trim 12000 people from its payrolls 
this year the plan is seen as a measure to soften the impact 
stinson said 
representatives of the communications workers of america did not 
immediately return telephone calls to their new york city 
headquarters 
atampt has 165400 nonmanagement workers

hallmark cards inc said tuesday it dropped a 
key condition of a tender offer for 270 million in junk bonds 
issued by the companys univision holdings inc unit and had 
accepted 2519 million of the bonds for payment 
hallmark a privately held greetings card company based in 
kansas city mo also said it had reached an agreement with bank 
lenders on restructuring the cashstrapped spanishlanguage 
television companys payments to the banks 
univision had been authorized to file for protection from 
creditors under terms of the federal bankruptcy laws if the tender 
offer was unsuccessful and hallmarks purchase averts that 
possibility 
hallmark had offered to pay 131 million for two series of junk 
bonds on which its 635 percentowned univision unit had missed 
interest payments 
but hallmark had set as a requirement of its tender offer that 
at least 90 percent of each issue must be tendered before it would 
be obligated to buy any of the securities 
on tuesday hallmark said it had dropped that requirement and 
accepted 1627 million in subordinated discount notes and 892 
million in subordinated debentures that were tendered under the 
offer 
the securities tendered represented about 986 percent of the 
discount notes but only about 85 percent of the outstanding 
debentures 
hallmark also extended the tender offer which was to have 
expired at 5 pm tuesday for another week until 5 pm april 24 
the company has agreed to defer interest payments on the 
securities it purchases under the tender offer for five years 
univision holdings based in new york operates an eightstation 
spanishlanguage tv network that reaches an estimated 92 percent of 
hispanic households in the united states 
it was unable to make interest payments of about 10 million due 
on its bonds and bank debt in february because of what it called 
cashflow problems 
hallmark offered to buy the bonds at a discount and defer 
interest payments on them its first buyback offer of 106 million 
failed to generate much interest and it sweetened the offer to 
131 million on march 30 
it separately agreed with certain banks to reschedule 
univisions bank loan repayments provided it completed the tender 
offer for the bonds

grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade as demand and cold wet 
weather in some cropproducing states affected the market 
soybean futures were higher on the strength of soybean oil 
which posted contract highs from august outward 
the bullish nature of soyoil is due to an expectation of tight 
domestic stocks for the remainder of the 19891990 marketing year 
the national oilseed processor association on monday reported a 
drop in its march soyoil stocks a period when inventories usually 
increase 
harvest delays in south america also proved to be a boost in 
soybean prices said jerry zusel an analyst with balfour maclaine 
corp in chicago 
corn prices reached new contract highs due to concern over the 
cold and wet weather in the corn belt that has delayed planting 
we could use a week to 10 days of dry weather to allow farmers 
to plant their crops zusel said adding that the corn pit would 
turn bullish once the crop was in the ground and if the rain 
continued 
selling on the part of speculators sent old crop wheat futures 
down sharply analysts noted that old crop wheat has been selling 
at a premium because of demand 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 5 cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 365 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 3 cents higher with may at 274 a bushel oats were 4 cents to

great american bank lost a record 2634 
million last year more than double a previous estimate and may 
be taken over by federal regulators unless the thrift can raise 
350 million by the end of the year officials said tuesday 
great american said in a statement that it may sell out or merge 
with another institution to raise the needed capital 
the office of thrift supervision which regulates savings and 
loans has approved a plan requiring great american to raise 350 
million in capital by dec 31 to meet regulatory capital 
requirements 
great american reported in february that it lost 1239 million 
in 1989 but a sixweek audit revealed its losses actually totaled 
a record 2634 million 
it was one of the largest losses ever for a california thrift 
and exceeded the previous record by imperial savings which federal 
regulators seized earlier this year after it posted a 2591 
million loss in 1989 the ots said 
independent auditors who reviewed great americans records found 
new problems stemming from loans great american made in the 
southwest particularly in arizona 
the 1989 loss dropped great americans capital level below all 
three of the new capital adequacy tests outlined in thrift bailout 
legislation approved by congress last year 
much of great americans problems have been attributed to its 
1986 purchase of a tucson thrift arizona has suffered an economic 
slowdown since then however which has left great american with a 
portfolio of souring loans 
in approving the institutions capital plan regulators 
established growth limits and several operating conditions on the 
thrift that allow it to engage only in approved business activities 
like residential and consumer lending 
great american cant pay dividends or make other capital 
distributions without approval from regulators who also have 
required the thrifts board of trustees to submit quarterly 
progress reports and meet quarterly capital targets 
if it fails to meet any of the conditions great american faces 
strict operating limits and possible seizure by federal regulators 
the thrifts statement said 
last month great american retained the investment banking firm 
of shearson lehman hutton inc to help it raise capital the bank 
and its advisers are exploring several alternatives great american 
said including its possible sale or merger with another financial 
institution 
great american said it also is pursuing alternatives that would 
raise its capital levels such as branch sales and other 
divestiture transactions that strategy however probably would 
reduce the banks earnings and leave it with a higherlevel of 
lowquality assets 
the thrift said its not sure if regulators would approve those 
types of sales or if they occurred whether it would be sufficient 
to bring the bank into compliance with regulatory guidelines

american telephone amp telegraph co has 
reached a tentative agreement on an early retirement plan with two 
unions part of the companys effort to cut costs 
the plan which would add three years of age and service to each 
workers record on may 1 would nearly double the number of workers 
eligible for a pension to 34000 said atampt spokesman burke stinson 
the plan allows some of atampts divisions to offer some workers 
greater retirement incentives five years added to age and 
seniority and a 15 percent boost in monthly pension payments in 
areas the company considers overstaffed stinson said 
the unions affected are the communications workers of america 
and the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
ibew spokesman joe penna said the special incentives are aimed 
at workers who would otherwise be laid off because their jobs have 
been made obsolete by technology 
atampt has 165400 union workers worldwide 
the proposal follows a similar package offered last year to 
managers as part of atampts sixyear effort to reduce its workforce 
consolidate operations and modernize equipment in the aftermath of 
the 1984 breakup of the bell system 
last year 12535 of 32121 eligible managers opted to retire 
early under a plan that added five years to each managers age and 
tenure and boosted pension payments by 15 percent there company 
has 116000 managers 
the management program cost atampt 163 million and is expected to 
save 450 million annually stinson said no one has estimated the 
savings from the latest proposal because it is not known how many 
workers and how many organizations with the company will 
participate in the early retirement plan stinson said 
penna said he expected about onethird of eligible union 
employees between 8000 and 12000 workers to opt for early 
retirement he said the proposal was an improvement over an offer 
rejected last month by the unions that plan would have added five 
years to each workers age but would not have raised monthly 
pension payments 
penna said the new package is a victory for unions because it 
eliminates thousands of jobs through early retirement rather than 
layoffs 
atampt with 280400 employees worldwide says it plans to cut 
12000 jobs this year about 93000 jobs have been eliminated since 
1984 when a court order broke up the bell telephone monopoly into 
competitive regional companies

of health risks

told congress it was the height of hypocrisy to export tobacco

upswing in tobacco exports

leaf and products are a result of american farmers producing the 
type of product wanted by foreign customers he also cited the 
removal of overseas trade barriers primarily in japan taiwan and

mcgrawhill inc tuesday said its earnings tumbled 47 percent in 
the first quarter in part because it has become more vulnerable to 
seasonal swings in business since entering into a school publishing 
venture 
the new yorkbased diversified publishing and information 
company reported revenue growth of 76 percent for the first three 
months of this year 
the gannett company meanwhile reported a barely perceptible 
increase in firstquarter earnings it said a sluggish consumer 
economy and restructuring in the retail industry combined to 
produce the poorest advertising environment in almost 20 years 
another media company dallasbased ah belo corporation said 
its net income was up about 16 percent from last year as revenue 
rose due to higher classified advertising volume and a boost in 
broadcast revenue from state primary election campaigns 
mcgrawhill earned 1649 million or 34 cents a share in the 
three months ended march 31 down sharply from 3117 million or 
64 cents a share a year earlier 
joseph l dionne chairman and chief executive officer of 
mcgrawhill said the formation last year of a joint venture school 
publishing company which was a major investment for the company 
has increased business seasonality 
the macmillanmcgrawhill school publishing co posted a loss in 
the first quarter as expected but dionne said mcgrawhills share 
of the loss was smaller than expected and it is anticipated that 
fullyear results will be fine 
last years quarterly income was boosted by a onetime 8 
million gain associated with a change in accounting procedures 
there also was a lower tax rate in the first 1989 quarter than in 
this years first quarter 
one of mcgrawhills publications is business week magazine it 
also has publications in various other specialized fields and 
broadcast interests 
gannett headquartered in arlington va said earnings totaled 
75 million or 47 cents a share in the quarter ended april 1 up 
slightly from 749 million or 47 cents a share the prior year 
revenue slipped less than 1 percentage point to 8134 million 
from 8176 million a year earlier 
the company blamed the downturn on a loss in advertising 
revenue newspaper advertising revenue declined by 3 percent in the 
fist quarter 
gannett said broadcast revenue also was lower but no figures 
were provided 
gannett a nationwide news and information company publishes 83 
daily newspapers and 52 nondaily publications besides publishing 
usa today the company operates 10 television stations 16 radio 
stations and gannett news services 
belo posted a profit of 28 million or 14 cents a share in 
the first three months of the year compared with 24 million or 
12 cents a share in the yearearlier quarter 
revenue rose to 563 million from 536 million reported in 
last years first quarter 
belo owns and operates the dallas morning news seven community 
newspapers in the dallasfort worth area and five televsion

it could be called a case of texas 
hamburglary 
but to lake jackson restaurateur richard cox the flap over 
mcdonalds texas homestyle burger is no laughing matter 
we have been using the texas burger concept for 17 years 
said cox owner of the red top restaurant chain that features 
texas style burgers 
they copied everything we did cox 45 said monday they 
thought it was a good idea and went ahead and used it and they 
didnt think anyone would challenge them 
cox has sued and has obtained an injunction against mcdonalds 
using the name in ads in his end of brazoria county until june 4 
when the case is to be tried 
the man who heads the corporation that owns the six mcdonalds 
in the county is doing some challenging of his own 
he is trying to portray himself as a small independent 
businessman run over by a large corporation said robert d 
humason sr of lake jackson hes fighting me im down here 
struggling with six stores 
humason heads dewey corp which owns the mcdonalds restaurants 
in brazoria county south of houston 
cox who owns six red top restaurants in brazoria county and one 
in houston said the mcdonalds ad campaign for their burger is 
almost identical to his texas style burger 
in a petition mcdonalds denied using coxs concept saying its 
promotion relies on generic logos that dont belong to cox 
humason said cox didnt have the marketing concept registered 
and does not hold sole rights to the three words in contention 
cox said the mcdonalds ads are so similar that confused 
customers have brought mcdonalds coupons to red top 
but humason said of 174000 coupons distributed during the 
marketing drive only three were mistakenly taken to red top 
restaurants

united telecommunications inc said 
tuesday it will buy the remaining 199 percent of us sprint and 
change its name to sprint corp to cash in on the high profile of 
its longdistance subsidiary 
united telecom also reported a 41 percent rise in first quarter 
profits but it said revenue growth was slower than expected at us 
sprint and that competition was intensifying from rivals atampt and 
mci 
us sprint was formed in 1986 as a joint venture of united 
telecom and gte corp it is now the nations no 3 longdistance 
company with 8 percent of the market 
united telecom bought a controlling interest in 1988 and was 
given an option to buy the remaining 199 percent 
the company will notify gte by the end of may that it is ready 
to exercise the option and take full control william esrey 
chairman and ceo told telecom shareholders at tuesdays annual 
meeting in this kansas city mo suburb 
the agreed selling price is about 500 million telecom 
spokesman jerry cosley said 
esrey said united telecoms name would change july 1 when the 
transaction with gte is expected to be completed shareholders 
approved the name change at the meeting 
its obviously not without some mixed emotions retiring 
chairman paul henson told shareholders we think that sprint 
corporation tells the financial community more clearly what we are 
about in addition it has very high public recognition 
the company also will shorten the longdistance subsidiarys 
name to sprint reflecting its attempts to expand overseas esrey 
said telecoms local telephone service subsidiaries such as 
united telephone of kansas will remain unchanged 
sprints revenues were 12 billion in the first quarter vs 
984 million in the same quarter last year an increase of 22 
percent but revenues increased only about 2 percent from the last 
quarter of 1989 less than the 4 percent to 6 percent forecast by 
company officials cosley said 
this is an area that we are somewhat disappointed in and that 
we are addressing esrey told stockholders 
cosley said some revenues from contracts already won by sprint 
simply did not materialize during the quarter as expected because 
equipment wasnt installed but those revenues will show up down 
the road he said 
esrey told shareholders sprint will introduce about 55 new 
products this year as competition in the longdistance market heats 
up he noted that both american telephone amp telegraph co and mci 
communications inc are developing fiberoptic telephone networks 
similar to the one sprint built a few years ago and now touts in 
its advertising 
daybyday that advantage tends to shrink on us esrey 
said we must now use our system to help us develop new 
products 
he said the company would consider buying smaller longdistance 
companies as mci did recently when it bought telecom usa inc of 
atlanta the fourthlargest us longdistance carrier but esrey 
said telecom would proceed with caution 
certainly if we can acquire customers by buying them cheaper 
than we can through other ways we will do it he said 
united telecom said it earned 1076 million or 51 cents a share 
on revenues of 202 billion in the first quarter compared with 
764 million or 36 cents a share on revenues of 177 billion a 
year earlier 
the companys stock closed 25 cents lower at 3987 on the new 
york stock exchange 
also at the meeting henson who had announced his retirement 
more than a year ago officially stepped down after 31 years he 
came to the company in 1959 as a vice president was named 
president in 1964 and chairman in 1966 he is given much credit for 
helping to form sprint in the mid1980s

jurors who decided ford motor co stole the 
intermittent windshieldwiper design from its inventor now must 
consider how much the automaker should pay in damages 
maryland inventor robert w kearns said he showed the windshield 
wiper to ford engineers in 1962 detailing the system in an attempt 
to sell it to the company ford has sold about 205 million 
vehicles equipped with the kearnsdesign wiper system 
this phase of the trial is going to deal with two issues 
damages and whether or not fords infringement was willful us 
district judge avern cohn told jurors as the trials damage phase 
opened tuesday 
cohn instructed the jury to make its decision on an award amount 
based solely on the reasonable royalty due kearns disregarding any 
interest or legal fees incurred during his 12yearold suit 
in the opening arguments attorneys for both kearns and ford 
presented different interpretations of how the jury should figure 
royalties 
kearns attorney paul janicke told the eightperson jury that 
kearns deserves 25 percent to 42 percent of fords profits from the 
device or between 193 million and 325 million 
but what is normally done when licensing patents in the auto 
industry is they tend to do things to the inventors rather than for 
them there isnt reasonable compensation at all janicke said 
ford attorney malcolm wheeler denied that the automaker 
knowingly duped the inventor saying its engineers believed they 
had developed the system themselves 
when the jury returned the decision that ford had infringed on 
the patents that came as quite a blow he said referring to the 
jan 29 jury verdict fords engineers did not act like people 
who thought they were stealing mr kearns designs 
but the jury decided the ford system was similar enough to 
kearns that it constituted patent violation the kearns system 
combines three elements an electric wiper motor a driver switch 
and a control module all of which were included in the ford 
version 
kearns also sued general motors corp chrysler corp 
daimlerbenz honda toyota nissan and 21 other companies 
claiming each has infringed on his patent the ford suit was the 
first to go trial 
kearns a former resident of detroit suburb river rouge who now 
lives in gaithersburg md claimed the automakers violated patents 
he obtained between 196774

43 cents per share in the three months ended april 1 up from

profit for the year

crude oil futures prices tumbled to their lowest 
levels in 14 months tuesday as traders dumped futures contracts on 
the belief that sluggish shortterm demand will do little to reduce 
abundant supplies 
refined petroleum products traded on the new york mercantile 
exchange closed mixed 
the contract for may delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil slid 41 cents to 1744 per 
42gallon barrel after inching up 7 cents on monday that was the 
lowest closing price for the nearmonth contract since west texas 
intermediate finished below 17 a barrel in february 1989 
according to elders futures inc 
the june july and august crude contracts posted smaller losses 
the nearmonth contract took the hardest hit partly because traders 
assumed that any effort opec might make to cut world oil supplies 
would come too late to benefit the may contract which expires 
friday 
the contract for may delivery of unleaded gasoline rebounded 
023 cent to 6044 cents a gallon after losing 166 cents on 
monday contracts for delivery in june and july settled unchanged 
from mondays closing levels while the august contract ended with a 
small drop 
among other refined petroleum products traed on the merc home 
heating oil for may delivery dropped 052 to 5420 cents a gallon 
wiping out much of mondays gain of 089 cent later contracts were 
mixed 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery settled at 1585 per 
million british thermal units down from 1598 on monday most 
later contracts finished higher 
energy market analysts said the selloff in crude reflected a 
bearish supply and demand situation a meeting of three opec 
ministers to discuss price weakness didnt produce any tangible 
results analysts said 
it is generally assumed that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries will not undertake a radical productioncutting 
program to prop up world oil prcies 
andrew lebow a broker at edampf man international futures 
inc said oil prices also were weighed down by speculation that 
weekly statistics due late tuesday after the markets closed would 
show another large buildup in crude inventory

mcdonalds corp said tuesday it would seek to 
substitute recycled materials for at least 25 percent of the goods 
needed to build remodel and equip its us restaurants 
the program dubbed mcrecycle usa would create the nations 
largest new market for recycled materials the company said 
were the largest user of recycled paper products in the 
quickservice restaurant business said shelby yastrow 
mcdonalds senior vice president of environmental affairs 
now were prepared to use our purchasing power to stimulate 
demand for a wide range of products made from recycled materials 
pressure has been building on fastfood and softdrink companies 
in recent years to promote recycling because of the large quantity 
of trash they generate 
mcdonalds said its initial goal calls for spending 100 million 
a year on recycled products for its restaurants or 25 percent of 
annual expenditures 
each year mcdonalds builds about 375 restaurants and remodels 
1000 in the united states products used include building 
insulation timber table tops waste containers wallboard and 
roofing materials 
ed rensi president of mcdonalds usa said in a statement that 
the 100 million target is in addition to more than 60 million the 
company already spends annually on recycled paper products such as 
napkins and drink carriers 
richard denison senior scientist for the nonprofit 
environmental defense fund in washington called mcdonalds plan 
a significant step forward but said it should be just one 
step in a larger overhaul of their own operation 
i think it demonstrates mcdonalds willingness to take a 
leadership position on solidwaste issues denison said 
i would hope that this is seen as something that would be 
emulated by other companies not only fastfood companies but also 
other large chains in other areas for example retail stores and 
the like 
in its announcement mcdonalds noted that last fall it began a 
recycling program for polystyrene foodpackaging in 450 restaurants 
in new england the company said it plans to expand the program to 
all its 8200 us restaurants as quickly as projected recycling 
facilities are opened 
the announcement is intended to encourage companies to build 
more centers to recycle polystyrene said chuck rubner assistant 
vice president for mcdonalds

members of the chicago mercantile exchange voted 
tuesday to approve restrictions on the dualtrading of certain 
contracts as a proposed alternative to a federal crackdown on the 
practice 
dual trading in which floor brokers trade for their own 
accounts and their customers at the same time is among practices 
the government investigated in a probe of suspected trading abuses 
at the merc and the chicago board of trade the nations largest 
futures exchanges 
it has long been considered a legitimate practice but critics 
say it leads to the temptation of frontrunning an illegal 
procedure in which traders try to make a profit trading for 
themselves ahead of their customers 
the merc and board of trade maintain that dual trading provides 
much of the markets liquidity 
but the commodity futures trading commission the federal 
regulator of the futures markets has proposed a partial ban on 
dual trading with an eye toward a possible total ban 
the mercs proposal would basically ban dual trading in the most 
heavily traded contract months but would allow it in less active 
contract months for each commodity 
the merc said 76 percent of the 1561 ballots cast favored the 
restrictions which were drawn up by an exchange committee and 
approved recently by board of governors the exchange has 2500 
active members 
the merc will ask the cftc to accept the newly approved proposal 
in lieu of the agencys plan 
the cftc is expected to make a final determination on dual 
trading this summer exchange spokesman andrew yemma said 
congress also is considering dualtrading restrictions that 
would potentially be more severe than those proposed by the merc 
the mercs proposed restrictions were recommended by a committee 
that reviewed trading practices in light of the government probe 
in which 48 people mostly traders have been indicted yemma said 
the mercs proposal would involve the most heavily traded 
contract months but it will not affect the lightly traded months 
which need the liquidity that dual trading provides yemma said 
the exchange believes those contracts are more easily monitored 
because they are less active he said 
for example in the mercs pork belly futures pit contracts are 
currently traded for delivery in may july august and february 
under the mercs proposal dual trading would be allowed for 
contracts in the more distant months which tend to be less active 
even before the government probe was revealed last year the merc 
banned dual trading in 1987 for 90 percent of the trades in its 
standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures pit yemma said 
there was a feeling among members in the pit that there were 
abuses of dual trading that needed to be addressed he said 
but yemma said the merc opposes the cftc plan because it does 
not take into account the vital role that dual trading plays in 
fostering liquidity in back months and lightly traded contracts 
the chicago board of trade also believes the cftc proposal goes 
too far said board of trade spokesman michael oconnell 
there currently are no restrictions on dual trading at the board 
of trade and officials there want to keep it that way oconnell 
said

increase in sales and 18 percent gain in income in the quarter 
primarily because of improvement in the pacific region
