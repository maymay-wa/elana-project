federal legislation should not preempt state 
law on oil spills senate democratic leader george mitchell and 
three state attorneys general argued friday 
preempting our state law and requiring us to rely on a 
system administered by the federal government is not a proposal 
which can be accepted by the state of maine maine attorney 
general james e tierney said in testimony before a subcommittee of 
the senate committee on environment and public works 
mitchell dmaine pledged that there will be no federal 
legislation that preempts state law 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner testifying before 
the subcommittee on environmental protection stressed that the 
bush administration favors strengthening us law and supporting 
ratification of two international treaties or protocols to 
provide compensation for cleanup and damages resulting from oil 
spills caused by foreign tankers 
to argue that state laws offer a viable alternative to the 
protocols is to ignore the facts skinner said 
the treaties he said offer advantages not obtainable under 
state law such as the enforceability of us judgments abroad and 
consistency of limits and costs of shipowners and oil companies 
americans should not have to suffer all the costs of oil 
pollution caused by foreign tankers when an international system 
exists to pay for cleanup and damages skinner said a vote for 
the protocols is a vote for the environment 
tierney disagreed 
a vote for the protocols is not a vote for the environment 
he said 
also opposing the protocols were alaska attorney general douglas 
b baily and washington attorney general kenneth o eikenberry 
even if coupled with an international fund the result would 
be that in some situations damages would go uncompensated because 
state law protection is unavailable baily said 
kenneth r dickerson an arco oil co senior vice president 
told the panel that his company supports giving the federal 
government the sole responsibility for oilspill cleanups 
skinners testimony came as 17 members of the california 
delegation called on interior secretary manuel lujan to resign as 
head of a presidential task force studying offshore drilling 
recent comments indicate he has already decided to proceed 
with offshore oil drilling out of fairness he must step down 
said rep george miller dcalif 
lujan told a recent meeting of the western governors association 
the renewed oneyear ban on offshore drilling in many areas 
approved by the house was a dangerous course that would 
increase reliance on foreign oil 
the california group said it was deeply disturbed by the 
comments but lujans spokesman steve goldstein said friday 
the secretary does not plan to resign from the task force

canada has closed the books on its worst air 
disaster concluding after three years of investigation that the 
crash that killed 256 americans in newfoundland is a mystery never 
likely to be solved 
there is nothing in all these deliberations which holds out 
any reasonable prospect of any more success than that achieved to 
date former supreme court justice willard estey concluded in his 
review released friday 
no inquiry is going to bring the deceased back estey said 
should we keep this book open forever 
estey was appointed to review the case after an earlier 
investigation board split sharply on the cause of the crash 
he said the evidence did not support the canadian aviation 
safety boards finding that ice on the wings of the arrow air 
charter dc8 was the probable cause of the dec 12 1985 crash at 
gander newfoundland 
but he likewise found no evidence to support the minority 
report signed by four of the boards nine members in december 
that an explosion or fire before impact probably caused the crash 
it should be no surprise to discover that occasions do arise 
when no explanation can be found for an event in which the efforts 
of mankind are overwhelmed by the forces of nature estey wrote 
les filotas one of the board members who signed the minority 
report said circumstances still exist to be investigated outside 
the four corners examined by estey 
a labyrinth has many more than four corners he said its 
very unfortunate that its going to be closed off 
transportation minister benoit bouchard who appointed estey to 
review the persistently controversial investigation in february 
said he accepted the recommendation that no further investigation 
is warranted 
no further physical evidence can e obtained it is very 
unlikely that any analytical approach will be uncovered which would 
expose the cause estey wrote 
the investigation was hampered by a cockpit voice recorder that 
didnt work and a primitive flight recorder that tracked only four 
instruments 
estey said at a news conference that it would be unproductive 
and sad to reopen the investigation nearly four years after the 
worst aviation disaster ever in canada 
youll have the same lonely result estey said 
the crash killed all 248 us servicemen returning to fort 
campbell ky from peacekeeping duties in the middle east along 
with eight american flight crew members 
the review found little justification for the either of the 
aviation boards conclusions 
there is nothing in the evidence or the material assembled by 
the board or in any of the studies prepared by or for the board 
which would indicate that any further inquiry into this accident 
almost four years later would determine the cause or causes with 
any greater certainty the review concluded 
the review noted the references throughout the investigation to 
possible terrorist involvement as a cause 
surmise and speculation inside and outside these proceedings 
abound factual evidence does not the review said nothing 
indicates any hope of uncovering explanations of this accident in 
those areas where another inquiry to be undertaken by canada 
estey said he did not find any oversight in the boards work 
that might have led to a concrete finding of what caused the crash 
he also discounted the charges that the investigation by the 
safety board plagued throughout by internal splits was a coverup 
theres no evidence of coverup and i wasnt appointed to 
cover anything up estey said 
estey said the families of those who died in the crash would 
deserve a continued investigation if reasonable hope of finding its 
cause existed 
but he also said that the relatives would not be served by 
endlessly poring over the same material 
estey reviewed evidence accumulated by the safety board and did 
not hold new hearings or consider new testimony 
the aviation safety board is being replaced by an agency that 
will be responsible for all types of transportation along the 
lines of the national transportation safety board in the united 
states 
kenneth thorneycroft the boards chairman called the review 
very valid very forceful

nasa on friday denied claims it will 
endanger the public by launching a nuclearpowered space probe 
aboard the shuttle in october 
the mission as designed analyzed and tested is safe reports 
to the contrary that have been circulating in the press are not 
true said john casani a deputy manager of flight projects at 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
managers of the galileo project showed the spacecraft to 
reporters in a hangar at the kennedy space center where it is being 
prepared for flight at the same time nuclear power opponents in 
washington dc urged nasa to reevaluate the potential hazards 
the christic institute a washington dc advocacy group which 
opposes nuclear power on satellites told reporters friday it plans 
to file a petition with nasa asking the agency to revise its 
environmental impact statement on galileo 
the issue is that the hazards of the galileo launch have not 
been explored sufficiently said robert richie a spokesman for 
the christic institute richie said nasa is relying on hazard 
estimates from the department of energy which have been shown in 
a number of cases to be flawed 
galileo is scheduled for launch from the kennedy space center 
oct 12 aboard the shuttle atlantis the crew of atlantis will 
deploy galileo on an eightyear mission to explore jupiter 
technicians have been assembling the spacecraft since may they 
will attach galileo to the booster on wednesday 
galileo will be powered by 131 singlewatt radioisotopic 
thermoelectric generators rtgs for short that convert heat 
created by decaying radioactive fuel into electricity the 50 
pounds of plutonium238 that will power galileo has raised fears of 
widespread contamination from radioactive fallout in the event of 
an accident 
rtgs have been an accepted source of power for spacecraft since 
the early 1960s the intense criticism started when the 1986 
explosion of space shuttle challenger heightened public awareness 
about the risks of space flight 
to critics an explosion like the one that destroyed challenger 
during liftoff is not the only danger they are also afraid galileo 
will reenter the atmosphere and break apart as it loops earth on 
its way to jupiter 
atlantis commander don williams is undaunted by the safety 
debate we really have looked into this a lot and im convinced 
it is absolutely safe to fly he said 
galileo will perform celestial gymnastics on its way to 
jupiter said spehalski it will swing around venus and then loop 
earth and the asteroid belt twice in the early 1990s using their 
gravity fields to gain speed before heading toward an encounter 
with jupiter in december 1995 
about five months before reaching jupiter galileo will release 
a probe toward the planet the probe will study the atmosphere and 
the weather as it parachutes to the surface 
launching a payload containing radioactive material requires 
special approval from the federal government which nasa officials 
expect to receive for galileo by sept 1

the unthinkable is being thought in the ruling 
party maybe its time to let the opposition take over and hope 
they mess up so the liberal democrats can return as heroes with 
their scandaltainted image refurbished 
the liberal democratic party has governed japan since its 
formation in 1955 but party leaders say it has been brought to an 
unprecedented crisis by sex and money scandals and unpopular 
policies 
sundays elections for half the seats in the 252member upper 
house of parliament could begin an erosion of power that eventually 
will make the revolutionary thought an inevitable reality 
sixtysix liberal democratic members are ending their sixyear 
terms and the party must retain 54 of those seats to keep control 
analysts and poll takers dont expect it to happen 
we are very confident the ldp will lose its majority said 
takashi yonezawa secretarygeneral of the democratic socialist 
party 
yonezawas party the fourthlargest opposition group in 
parliament has been negotiating with the leading opposition 
socialists the buddhistsupported komeito clean government party 
and the social democratic federation about a possible coalition 
government if the conservative liberal democrats lose their mandate 
elections for the lower house where the real power lies need 
not be held until next year but a liberal democratic loss on 
sunday could create pressure for an earlier vote the governing 
party has 243 of the 512 seats in the lower house and alliances 
with smaller conservative parties give it a majority 
the four opposition parties talking coalition have 78 seats in 
the upper house compared with 142 for the liberal democrats and 
must win 49 more on sunday to gain control 
a coalition would not be easy because they have major 
differences on what changes to make in the policies of the 
probusiness prowestern liberal democrats 
at a news conference friday yonezawa said socialist policies 
were unrealistic and indicated the possibility of an alliance 
with the liberal democrats 
both yonezawas party which is more conservative than its name 
indicates and the liberal democrats say the socialists would 
cancel the usjapan security treaty the socialists say they 
would seek revisions 
the dsp holds a balancing ticket and depending on the 
outcome of the election could play a pivotal role in japans 
politics the party leader said 
shizuo sato a firstterm liberal democrat in the lower house 
expressed the view gaining currency in the governing party 
if the peoples decision goes against the ldp instead of 
forming a coalition of our own it might be better to turn the 
government over to an opposition coalition 
im sure theyll fail and hurt the economy he said in an 
interview then the people will realize the value of our party 
we would also have time in the interim to regroup and resolve some 
of our internal problems 
sato said he does not advocate simply handing over power but it 
might have a beneficial effect if we have no choice because of 
the way people vote we are doing our best to see that they stay 
with us 
after a major loss in tokyo elections this month trade and 
industry minister seiroku kajiyama said speaking as a lawmaker 
and not a cabinet member i think it might be good for the party to 
turn the administration over to the opposition once that would 
give us time to regroup 
an aide said later that kajiyamas remarks applied to the tokyo 
city government not national politics but added this might be 
different if there are big losses in the upper house 
several other cabinet ministers have expressed similar views 
privately said political analyst asao yamaguchi but they say so 
on the condition of big losses later in the lower house 
support for the liberal democrats has dwindled because of a 3 
percent sales tax imposed april 1 an influencebuying scandal that 
caused prime minister noboru takeshita to resign and allegations 
that his successor sousuke uno kept several paid mistresses 
farmers traditionally a reliable source of for the governing 
party have been alienated by its moves to open japan to 
agricultural imports 
a poll published friday by the newspaper asahi said 28 percent 
of those surveyed said they planned to vote socialist compared 
with 21 percent for the liberal democrats and 40 percent were 
undecided the nationwide poll of 2410 people was taken july 910 
before elections three years ago the asahi poll put liberal 
democrat support at 46 percent and the socialists at 11 percent

soviet marshal sergei f akhromeyev is taking 
home rave reviews for his unprecedented testimony bringing glasnost 
to capitol hill 
akhromeyev fielded questions for nearly five hours from the 
house armed service committee friday providing data on soviet 
military spending changes in troop deployments and arms control 
positions and revealing that soviet tank production was cut 40 
percent this year down to 1700 tanks 
i really thought it was brilliant for a man out of a system in 
which there has never been very much of this sort of thing said 
chairman les aspin dwis he was extremely skillful 
could the soviet marshal be taken at face value 
who knows aspin replied you weigh what he says against 
all the other evidence like everything else just as you do with 
any witness 
the important thing is to see if hes credible on the things 
you can check he said if he is hes more credible on the 
things you cant 
a soviet soldier since 1940 akhromeyev became mikhail s 
gorbachevs chief military adviser last year after retiring as 
chief of the soviet general staff 
the testimony was a contest of symbols soviet and american 
the red army officer wore his marshals uniform olivebrown 
with red piping with large gold stars on his shoulder boards 11 
rows of decorations a gleaming gold star perched above them 
around him were the formal symbols of the united states 
a giant american eagle was emblazoned on the wall behind the 
witness the flags of the army navy marine corps and air force 
each with a thick cluster of battle streamers were draped around 
the room 
never has so highranking a soviet official appeared before 
this committee aspin said through the years we have seen many 
uniforms sit at that table but never one like yours 
gesturing at the oil portraits of former committee chairmen 
many of whom served at the height of the cold war aspin added 
if one or two of them look a little uncomfortable you will have 
to understand that these quickly changing times take some getting 
used to 
akhromeyev obviously accustomed to gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness didnt appear to have much trouble adjusting 
when asked a question he didnt want to answer he explained 
that the soviets have military secrets just as the americans do 
at a break he patiently signed autographs penning them on 
copies of his prepared testimony 
responding to questions the marshal said the reason soviet 
personnel costs were only about 7 billion last year compared to 
the 78 billion paid us troops was that the soviet union cant 
afford high wages 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss asked whether 
akhromeyev was suggesting cutting the salaries of highranking 
american officers 
oh god forbid akhromeyev replied i dont want you to 
get me into a fight with american generals and admirals i just 
started becoming friends with them recently 
one sign of the times was hard to interpret 
committee staff members passed out a detailed biographical 
sketch of the soviet witness 
a caption said it had been prepared by the central intelligence 
agency

the dc10 engine that investigators say may 
have exploded in flight knocking out united flight 232s flight 
control systems was involved in repairs a day before the plane 
crashed in an iowa corn field 
but the supervising federal investigator who friday confirmed 
the repairs said there was no indication the work would have or 
could have affected the engine in wednesdays crash 
the work was done on a pneumatic system attached to the general 
electric cf66 jet engine 
investigators this weekend were focusing on the tail section and 
the engine that is mounted on the tail of the widebodied airliner 
which crashed during an emergency landing at sioux city killing 
more than a third of the people aboard authorities disagreed on 
whether 293 or 295 people were on the flight 
government records show that since the early 1970s dc10s with 
cf66 type engines have had six previous failures in which damage 
extended beyond the engine 
the engine builder and a federal aviation administration 
spokesman both said however that the cf66 has a good performance 
record 
david lane spokesman for general electrics aircraft engine 
division said 469 cf66 engines are in service 
he said they were built exclusively for the dc10 and show a 
rate of one departure delay or flight cancellation due to an engine 
problem for every 2000 flights 
thats an admirable record he said lane said the company 
would have no comment on specifics of the sioux city crash 
investigation 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the cf66 engines have had one 
shutdown about every 30000 flying hours which he said is a good 
record this covers instances where the engine shut down itself or 
the pilot shut it down because a problem was indicated 
cf66 engines have been the subject of seven faa airworthiness 
directives since they went into service in the early 1970s 
farrar said such directives ordinarily order airliners to make 
modifications on the engines or in procedures for maintaining them 
the most recent order was in late 1988 and involved replacement 
of an engine shaft after 17600 flights farrar said 
flight 232s rear engine had been on the 15yearold plane for 
about nine months said a spokesman for rep james oberstar 
dminn who heads a house aviation subcommittee and obtained 
information about the plane from a united airlines vice president 
the engine either was new or newly rebuilt when it was installed 
last october said jim berard oberstars spokesman 
berard said the congressman also was told the engine was in for 
maintenance and fully checked the day before the flight but he 
said oberstar had not determined whether the work could have had 
anything to do with the engine failure 
united airlines spokesman herb gardner in chicago said all 
maintenance records concerning the dc10 one of 56 in uniteds 
fleet had been turned over to the national transportation safety 
board we just simply do not provide any of that information once 
its been given to the board he said 
safety board member jim burnett who is supervising 
investigators in sioux city said maintenance work was done on the 
aircrafts tail engine tuesday but he said we have no 
indication at this time that that was something that could have 
affected the course of the accident 
he said the work was done on the planes pneumatic system which 
uses excess pressure generated by the giant jet engine to power the 
aircrafts airconditioning system

the bush administrations clean air bill 
already denounced by environmentalists is now receiving criticism 
from industry for its tough measures on utilities and ambitious 
program for cleanfueled cars 
assertions by some that this is a weak bill are simply 
ludicrous william fay administrator of the multiindustry clean 
air working group said friday 
environmentalists and their congressional supporters argued that 
president bush caved in to industrys economic concerns and 
produced a watereddown bill that would not fix the nations 
worsening air pollution 
fay was not quite as harsh in assessing the legislation which 
bush presented to congress on friday with a promise to make clean 
air the birthright of every american 
the industry official said the presidents package 
significantly strengthens the clean air act to address ozone and 
carbon monoxide pollution as well as acid rain and air toxics 
emissions but he expressed concern that the bill moves in the 
direction of limiting flexibility and economic growth 
the administration friday defended the measure on several fronts 
bush invited key lawmakers to a white house ceremony at which he 
formally sent the bill to congress he assured them it would clean 
the air in us cities stop the degradation thats been caused 
by acid rain by the end of this century and cut airborne toxic 
chemicals from major sources by at least 75 percent 
later the environmental protection agency assistant 
administrator for air william rosenberg said the government would 
vigorously enforce a new law with civil and criminal penalties and 
have monitors at each smokestack 
the bills penalties would be imposed on those who tamper with 
auto pollution control equipment and on industries that exceed 
emissions from smokestacks he said 
rosenberg added that the epa would not hesitate to use extreme 
measures against cities failing to meet standards including new 
authority to curtail drinking water hookups a move that would 
stop construction of new shopping centers or apartments 
fay complained that acid rain reduction provisions would not 
only require utilities to reduce pollution from their current 
generating output but would force them into even costlier controls 
if they sought to increase capacity to meet growing demand for 
electricity 
the bush plan will limit growth and options available to a 
utility he said 
fay said he doubts the administration will be able to meet its 
goal of starting a cleanburning fuel program for cars by 1995 in 
nine heavily polluted cities he said too much research needs to be 
done with such fuels and added that industry pushed unsuccessfully 
for only a small demonstration program 
he called the bill is a disincentive to make gasoline burn 
cleaner 
we feel reductions in gasoline powered cars were better he 
said 
general motors corp chrysler corp and the ford motor co 
issued statements friday saying they support the proposal but that 
its provisions would be tough to meet

a senior us diplomat under investigation as 
a possible soviet spy may have caused a very serious breach of 
security for the united states according to the state department 
felix s bloch a 30year career employee reportedly was 
videotaped passing a briefcase to a soviet agent while stationed at 
the us embassy in vienna bloch allegedly first had contact with 
the soviets three years ago abc news reported friday night 
there was no answer at blochs home in an elegant washington 
apartment building friday cars apparently with surveillance agents 
who neighbors said were around the building earlier in the week 
were not evident friday night 
bloch has been placed on leave his building pass withdrawn and 
his security clearance revoked the state department said in a 
statement 
bloch has not been charged with anything 
state department spokeswoman anita stockman said it was 
pursuing the inquiry thoroughly in order to identify the 
compromised security which has occurred and the appropriate legal 
steps 
officials said they believed it was the first time a us 
diplomat has been involved in an espionage case since the famous 
alger hiss case of the late 1940s there have been other cases 
involving military personnel attached to embassies 
abc quoted unidentified state department officials who said 
this has been a very serious breach of security 
bloch was director of the office of european regional 
politicaleconomic affairs in the departments bureau of european 
and canadian affairs in that position he would have been involved 
in almost anything that dealt with two or more european countries 
including the soviet union 
in vienna where as deputy chief of mission he had been the no 
2 official in the embassy bloch would have had access to all the 
embassys activities and communications 
vienna has been the site of the longrunning and largely 
unfruitful talks on conventional arms reduction in europe the 
mutual balanced force reduction talks between the nato alliance and 
the warsaw pact 
bloch returned from vienna about two months ago when he was 
picked up by fbi agents according to abc 
a department source who spoke on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that bloch completed his vienna assignment and 
returned to washington about a year ago but that he apparently 
made a return trip earlier this year 
abc showed pictures of men in cars at his home who it said 
were fbi agents keeping him under 24hour surveillance soviet 
agents also have been watching bloch the network said 
no surveillance cars were evident friday night but neighbor 
preston pitts said the cars had been around for at least three 
weeks 
oh they were everywhere like ants said pitts we thought 
they were surveillance but we decided they couldnt be surveillance 
because they were too obvious we thought then they were protecting 
him 
pitts said bloch told him months ago he was in line for a 
nomination as ambassador to a south american country 
pitts said he had not seen bloch his wife or a daughter since 
thursday 
i am absolutely flabbergasted he was such a gentleman he 
said 
collins bird another neighbor said you never know who 
youre living next door to hes a very nice pleasant man 
bloch a native of austria turned 54 wednesday he holds a 
bachelors degree from the university of pennsylvania and a 
masters degree from the university of california at berkeley 
the last public edition of the departments biographical 
register published in 1974 said bloch had served in berlin 
dusseldorf west germany and caracas venezuela 
in his state department position bloch published an article in 
the julyaugust issue of the foreign service journal on us 
relations with the european community 
the network said state department investigators believe bloch 
was dismayed that after 30 years he had not reached the rank of 
ambassador

representatives of us intelligence agencies 
are meeting through the weekend to prepare a court statement that 
could kill the irancontra criminal case against a former cia 
operative 
the justice department was putting together the government 
affidavit that would block disclosures about some cia programs in 
the case of joseph fernandez who is scheduled to go on trial 
monday on charges of lying about his assistance to oliver norths 
secret contra supply network 
an administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
told the associated press that intelligence officials hoped to have 
the affidavit ready in time for the trial monday morning 
fernandez the cias former station chief in costa rica is the 
highestranking employee of the agency ever to face a criminal 
trial in connection with his work there 
the intelligence officials hope to prevent disclosure of 
classified information about three highly sensitive united states 
government programs with costa rica independent counsel lawrence 
walshs office said in court papers friday fernandez says the 
programs demonstrated costa ricas concern about the military 
threat posed by neighboring nicaragua 
with a justice department affidavit in hand us district judge 
claude hilton would have no choice under federal law but to 
prohibit fernandez from using in his defense the classified 
information detailed in the affidavit 
prosecutor laurence shtasel said in that event portions of at 
least one count of the fourcount indictment against fernandez 
would be abandoned 
the prosecutor said attorney general dick thornburgh also is 
considering a cia request to broaden the affidavit to exclude 
references at fernandezs trial to cia stations in various 
countries 
that step would have more drastic consequences for the case 
against fernandez shtasel told the judge at the court hearing in 
alexandria va 
if the cias request for a broader affidavit is granted 
the case will be untriable shtasel said in court papers filed 
later in the day 
the judge rejected a request by shtasel to delay mondays 
starting date for the trial and the judge also turned down a motion 
by fernandez lawyer thomas wilson to throw out the case 
fernandez is accused of four criminal charges single counts of 
obstructing the cia inspector generals office and the 
investigative tower commission and two counts of making false 
statements

a house committee will consider cutting 500 
million from president bushs budget for the b2 stealth bomber in 
the newest sign of congressional opposition to the high cost of the 
radarevading aircraft 
a source speaking on condition of anonymity said friday the 
appropriations defense subcommittee voted to make the cuts in 
closed session as part of a package of changes in bushs defense 
budget 
the source said the panel also voted thursday to cut star wars 
by 11 million and to fund the v22 osprey and the f14d fighter 
two programs the administration has earmarked for extinction 
the measure which now goes to the full appropriations 
committee also included funds to purchase 12 ea6 jet fighters 
the source said 
the defense department is asking for 47 billion for the b2 
which will carry a price tag of 530 million per plane the house 
armed services committee last month cut the overall request by 800 
million 
the action by the appropriations subcommittee would still leave 
42 billion for the plane 
bush has gotten personally involved in the lobbying effort 
telling groups of congressmen at the white house this week the b2 
is necessary to the nations security 
in the case of the f14d the committee coupled its approval of 
13 billion for 24 planes with a recommendation to close the 
production line at grumman corp in bethpage ny in three years 
instead of doing 12 this year and 12 next year which was the 
armed services committee plan we said fund em all up front 
deliver em over three years and begin the orderly closedown of the 
line the source said 
the 500 million cut from bushs b2 request came from 
purchasing funds according to the source that would leave 22 
billion in purchasing funds for the b2 and 2 billion for research 
and development 
the black wedgeshaped bomber made its first successful test 
flight this week but still faces opposition from lawmakers who 
fear the planes could wind up costing up to 1 billion apiece 
the subcommittee called for 157 million for the osprey the 
administration wants to cancel it saying conventional helicopters 
could serve the same purpose as the tiltwing rotorcraft which 
takes off like a helicopter and flies like a plane 
on star wars the strategic defense initiative the subcommittee 
called for 35 billion considerably less than the 46 billion 
bush proposed 
the senate armed services committee voted last week to accept 
defense secretary dick cheneys proposal to eliminate the f14d 
long island ny legislators have been lobbying hard all year 
trying to keep the f14d alive on the grounds that closing the line 
would cost some 5100 jobs on long island and would effectively put 
the grumman corp out of the aircraft business grumman also builds 
the ea6 jet fighter

the pilot of a philippine airlines 
plane that crashed on a busy highway ignored air traffic 
controllers who warned him not to land in a heavy rainstorm 
airport officials said today 
officials also said that electricians apparently failed to turn 
on runway lights to assist the pilot as he brought the plane in for 
landing at the manila airport 
at least eight people were killed on the ground friday and 91 
others mostly passengers were injured when the twinengine bac 
111 jet overshot a runway plowed through a concrete wall and 
bounced onto manilas south expressway friday 
the plane carrying 98 people slammed into at least four 
vehicles on the 12lane highway and careened onto some railroad 
tracks witnesses said 
thirty of the injured remained hospitalized today one in 
critical condition said airline spokesman enrique santos 
the plane was attempting to land in manila after traveling from 
zamboanga city 540 miles southeast of manila 
at that time the pilot was given instructions to pull up 
based on the analysis of the controller that he was not going to 
make it rudy flores control tower supervisor told the 
associated press the pilot did not acknowledge and instead of 
pulling up he continued to descend unluckily enough he did 
not make it he overshot the runway 
rolando estabillo another airline spokesman declined comment 
on the allegation santos said earlier that the pilot capt 
ricardo misa had been cleared for landing when runway is in 
sight 
rose reyes flores deputy acknowledged that such clearance was 
given but said it was before the weather suddenly deteriorated 
she said the clearance was given when the plane last radioed the 
tower while the aircraft was at least 5 miles away 
the instructions were changed when the weather suddenly 
deteriorated and controllers who were keeping track of the 
aircraft determined he could not make it safely officials said 
at that time he was still very high but he was above the 
runway already flores said 
ms reyes said the runway lights were not on because it was 
midafternoon but after the skies darkened and rain began falling 
in sheets tower controllers asked airport electricians to turn on 
the runway lights to help guide the plane 
they told us the lights were on thats its okay but when we 
saw that there were no runway lights we called them again ms 
reyes said there may have been something wrong with the lights 
maybe the cables we dont know 
she and flores declined to make further statements saying an 
investigation was under way

some state officials want congress to resist 
pressure from the exxon valdez accident and allow local authorities 
to decide how to handle oil spills 
the attorneys general from three states differed sharply with 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner who told a 
congressional panel friday that stronger federal rules are the only 
way to ensure the united states is compensated for spills by 
foreign tankers 
to argue that state laws offer a viable alternative to 
international treaties is to ignore the facts skinner told the 
senate environment and public works environmental protection 
subcommittee 
the administration wants to strengthen federal law and ratify 
two international treaties involving payment for damages resulting 
from oil spills caused by foreign tankers 
but the local officials say those closest to tanker traffic and 
accidents know best how to deal with the consequences 
preempting our state law and requiring us to rely on a 
system administered by the federal government is not a proposal 
which can be accepted by the state of maine maine attorney 
general james e tierney said 
even if coupled with an international fund the result of the 
treaties would be that in some situations damages would go 
uncompensated because state law protection is unavailablesaid 
alaska attorney general douglas b baily 
tierney and bailey were joined by washington state attorney 
general kenneth o eikenberry 
attempts to tighten regulations on fuel tankers have picked up 
speed since the exxon tanker valdez ran aground march 24 in 
alaskas prince william sound spilling nearly 11 million gallons 
of alaska crude into the water 
kenneth r dickerson an arco oil co senior vice president 
told the panel his company supports giving the federal government 
sole responsibility for oilspill cleanups

the bush administration facing pressure from 
lawmakers opposed to the costly b2 bomber is raising the stakes 
by arguing that halting the program would be devastating to arms 
control efforts 
in meetings at the white house and on capitol hill friday 
officials told congressmen that the failure to fund the stealth 
bomber would force the united states to withdraw its proposal in 
strategic arms reduction talks with the soviet union 
the coordinated effort for the radarevading aircraft was in 
evidence all over the capitol the pilots who guided the b2 on its 
first flight monday air force col rich couch and northrop corp 
test pilot bruce hinds appeared before a senate armed services 
subcommittee and later met with members of congress 
elsewhere defense secretary dick cheney and adm william crowe 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff met with lawmakers to plead 
their case for the bomber 
president bush told house republicans at a white house lobbying 
session that stopping the 70 billion program would be 
devastating to arms control efforts according to one 
congressman in attendance rep william dickinson of alabama 
but some members remained unswayed 
i was not convinced by the presidents remarks rep john 
rowland rconn said there are a small number of republicans 
and hopefully a large number of democrats who believe testing 
should be completed before a commitment is made to build the 132 
planes the pentagon wants 
by 1993 we will have purchased 44 planes at a cost of 40 
billion rowland said he said it is best to build a few fly 
them around develop them and then make a determination 
rowland rep john kasich rohio and rep ronald dellums 
dcalif plan to introduce an amendment next week to the defense 
bill to build only 13 bombers 
rowland said bush rejected the offer 
the white house has also rejected a proposal by rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee to pay for 
just two bombers in 1990 and 1991 and not the eight sought by the 
pentagon aspin argues congress needs more information on the plane 
before deciding whether to kill it or spend more money 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash indicated his support 
for the aspin plan friday 
i think if i were voting i would probably be inclined to 
support it he told reporters i think we should not stop 
this program but we should have an opportunity to review it in the 
near future 
the pentagon has invested about 23 billion in the program and 
hopes to purchase 132 bombers at a cost of about 70 billion 
but lawmakers have suffered sticker shock from the price tag 
530 million for a single plane 
for fiscal 1990 the defense department proposed spending 47 
billion for the b2 but the house armed services committee last 
month cut that by 800 million 
separately a congressional source who requested anonymity said 
friday that a house appropriations subcommittee voted thursday to 
strike 500 million in b2 funds from the authorization bill 
the argument that failure to build the b2 would undermine the 
start negotiations which are aimed at reducing us and soviet 
strategic or longrange bombers missiles and nuclear submarines by 
30 to 50 percent raised the ire of at least one senate armed 
services committee member 
sen timothy wirth dcolo called it almost legislative 
blackmail

investigators narrowed their focus 
friday to the tail of the illfated united airlines dc10 and a 
blown rear engine that may have spewed pieces of metal like 
shrapnel wrecking the jets steering system 
investigators also told of a heroic effort by an offduty pilot 
to help gain control of the airplane 
national transportation safety board spokesman jim burnett said 
an offduty united pilot was on the plane and offered his 
assistance to flight attendants shortly after the rear engine blew 
the pilot was allowed into the cockpit to help the copilot 
wrest control of the crippled plane 
the only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine 
thrust burnett said the offduty pilot was on his knees 
manipulating the throttle 
what you have here is a situation of two men desperately 
trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft he 
said 
rescue officials said friday they had recovered 109 bodies and 
planned to lift a large section of the fuselage with a crane to see 
if there were two more bodies underneath more than 180 people 
survived the crash 
it was not known whether the offduty pilot whose name was not 
released survived the crash but united reported shortly after the 
crash wednesday that everyone in the cockpit had survived 
united however still had not released definite figures on the 
number of victims and survivors nearly 2 days after the crash 
burnett said 111 people were killed and united said 109 people 
died 
burnett said ntsb figures showed 297 were on board two more 
than earlier reports and that there were 186 survivors united 
said there were 296 on board with 187 survivors 
i dont know what the ntsb is using for their count said 
sue moss united spokeswoman we feel ours is correct 
of the injured 47 remained at two hospitals friday in 
conditions ranging from very critical to good 
state medical examiner tom bennett said an autopsy would be 
performed on all bodies recovered to determine the cause of death 
and to ease family concerns 
id rather have the evidence and the answers right now for the 
family members three to six months down the road theyre going to 
be tormented by this they are going to come back to us with 
questions he said 
bennett said 12 autopsies had been completed with pathologists 
crime investigators fbi fingerprint experts and dentists working 
in a makeshift morgue set up in a hangar at the air national guard 
base adjacent to the airport 
meanwhile investigators from the national transportation safety 
board began measuring the tail section from the shattered plane in 
the search for clues to the crash 
the fan on the engine in the tail is not with the rest of the 
wreckage said burnett we hope to be able to find that and 
were going to be looking at an additional wreckage area about 60 
miles away from the principal site 
field workers near alta about 55 miles east of sioux city 
reported a large section of the jumbo jet in a test field 
wednesday shortly before the jet crashed turned a cartwheel and 
exploded in flames during an emergency landing at sioux gateway 
airport flight 232 had been bound for chicago and philadelphia 
from denver 
burnett said that early examination of the hydraulic lines led 
investigators to conclude that at least two were severed 
they were cut cleanly its very clean he said 
burnett said the third hydraulic line was badly damaged from 
contact with the ground 
burnett also said preliminary findings showed that the small 
wing of the tail had several holes and the hydraulic system had 
lost all fluid the hydraulic system is routed through the tail and 
allows the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls 
investigators were surprised to discover the entire fanrotor 
system missing from the rear engine the first time he has seen 
that burnett said the dc10 has three engines one on each wing 
and on the tail 
burnett acknowledged friday that it was conceivable that pieces 
of metal spewing from a disintegrating rear engine could have 
caused the small holes on on the tail wing and could have severed 
the hydraulic lines in the tail section but he cautioned against 
jumping to conclusions about the cause of the accident a warning 
echoed by aviation expert pat murphy 
if you start with an engine throwing off the blades of the 
fan called an uncontained failure its a plausible chain of 
events to get at how the steering may have been knocked out 
murphy vice president of operations for avtias inc a reston 
vabased aircraft consulting firm said in a telephone interview 
but what is being speculated may not have happened and from 
the standpoint of the industry what is potentially much more 
important is why the engine developed uncontained failure he 
said the cf6 engine is not historically a bladethrowing 
engine 
the manufacturer general electric co said its ge aircraft 
engines division sent a fivemember team to help investigate 
the chief flight attendant told the ntsb an explosion rocked the 
jet over western iowa knocking flight attendants to the floor 
burnett said at a news conference late thursday the attendant who 
was unidentified went into the cockpit and found the flight crew 
struggling to regain control of the plane he said 
thirtyfour minutes before trying the emergency landing the 
pilot told air traffic controllers he had almost no control of the 
aircraft burnett said 
investigators also were reviewing maintenance records on the 
15yearold jet burnett said repair work involving the rear engine 
was done on the plane the day before the crash to correct a 
problem with the pneumatic system 
the pneumatic system uses excess pressure generated by the giant 
engine to power the aircrafts airconditioning system burnett 
said there was no way that problem would have could have 
affected the engine itself 
iowa air and army national guardsmen and investigators from the 
fbi and the state department of criminal investigation continued to 
look for wreckage around the runway 
their efforts focused on a large blackened section of the 
fuselage lying in a cornfield alongside the scorched runway where 
united pilot capt al c haynes brought the crippled jumbo jet down 
the national guard and medical examiners had asked families for 
dental and medical records and other information that would help 
identify the victims said sinda 
bennett said twothirds of the victims apparently were killed by 
the impact of the crash and the remaining third in the fire it 
touched off visual identification is often impossible for burn 
victims bennett said the victims also included children who 
frequently havent had dental xrays taken he said 
the rev lawrence soens bishop of the roman catholic diocese of 
sioux city said a special mass for about 400 people at noon 
there are moments of great tragedy when our very nature calls 
out to god soens said during his homily this is such a 
moment

ethiopia next week to serve as a mediator between the government 
and eritrean rebels in an effort to resolve their longrunning 
conflict a us diplomat says 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen on friday said carter 
had been accepted by both the marxist government of haile mengistu 
mariam and by the eritrean rebels who have been warring against the

union 
the soviets have been pressing mengistu to negotiate with the 
rebels and end the costly war in an effort to cut soviet aid to 
ethiopia 
carter visited ethiopia earlier this year and met with mengistu

the house has approved a 143 billion foreign 
aid bill that sends a warning to the philippines to improve its 
management of aid dollars and begins president bushs initiatives 
in hungary and poland to boost private development 
the lawmakers voted 329 to 69 friday to approve what 
traditionally has been one of the most contentious pieces of 
legislation congress takes up each year the bill one of 13 basic 
money measures that fund the full array of federal programs goes 
to the senate next 
the measure includes 160 million as the us contribution 
toward the multilateral assistance initiative for the philippines 
an effort to bolster the government of president corazon aquino 
with an influx of development aid 
but that amount falls below the 200 million pledged to the 
program by president bush the cut was intended to signal concerns 
that money already flowing to the philippines is not being used or 
is being wasted 
the measure includes 10 million for poland and 5 million for 
hungary to begin a threeyear 125million plan announced by bush 
last week to encourage private development in those two east bloc

the majorettes twirled plungers others 
banged on bedpans and blasted on kazoos as 150 residents of this 
college town marched and stumbled down main street to celebrate the 
final stage of a sewer project 
the tongueincheek celebration called sewerfest gave residents 
a chance friday to vent their frustration at sewer construction 
that has thrown car alignments out of whack and forced motorists 
into long convoluted routes 
didnt you love the noises it was wonderful beamed marion 
b kelly one of hundreds who lined the main street of this 
picturesque town of 8860 about 30 miles southwest of cleveland 
parade marchers embodied the necessary and the unlovely some 
dressed as sewer rats others wore construction overalls and draped 
draincleaning equipment around their necks many marchers wore 
plungers on their heads 
among the floats were a sewer cleaning cart marked sewer 
busters and a wooden outhouse door flapping open and shut 
carted on a trailer a caravan of a dozen dump trucks blasted their 
horns 
the oberlin downtown merchants association sponsor of 
sewerfest set a theme of alternative transportation methods for 
oberlin streets and invited folks to climb onto bicycles and 
skateboards before joining the parade 
since last fall city crews have ripped up streets and set up 
barricades to upgrade an aging sewer system overtaxed by storm 
water runoff 
its kind of getting there said karen smith assistant 
public works director for the city which is the home of oberlin 
college weve got a target completion of aug 31 for the bulk of 
the sewer work on the streets 
she said one problem was two main streets were under 
construction at the same time 
ive had the advantage of knowing whats going on day to day 
although ive forgotten a few detours from time to time people who 
usually can just run down the street to the grocery store now have 
to go two miles around she said 
yvonne hazlett who braved the road hurdles from nearby elyria 
so that she could march in the parade also lamented the situation 
oh its terrible you cant go east you cant go west the 
streets are all banged up she said as she leaned on her plunger 
she wore a rubber rat taped to her shirt 
some participated in sewerfest in a more sedate manner by 
entering the essay contest 
entrants wrote about their worst experiences poking past the 
citys broken streets and trenches in hopes of winning a suitable 
prize a frontend alignment for their car

the crew of the illfated united airlines jet 
desperately sought the advice of the airlines experts in san 
francisco when officials on the ground in iowa couldnt help them 
a newspaper reported 
if you have any suggestions holler one of the three crew 
members radioed to workers at uniteds maintenance headquarters on 
wednesday 
but the crisis aboard the dc10 bound for chicago from denver 
was so unusual that it took the experts 10 minutes to understand 
the severity of the problem and they still offered no solutions 
the new york times reported saturday 
meanwhile abc news reported friday that the navigational system 
at the sioux city iowa airport where the pilot was trying to land 
the plane had been turned off 
glenn bush a federal aviation administration manager in des 
moines said the building housing the navigational aid system known 
as vor or very high frequency omnirange was scheduled to be shut 
down at noon on wednesday about four hours before the crash for 
maintenance 
a vor gives pilots the bearing of the airport and pilots use the 
information to check whether they are on course 
bush said all pilots were notified of the shutdown weeks before 
however he said it did not even contribute to anything to the 
aircraft as far as getting it back to the airport 
united flight 232 was unable to fly in such a pattern because 
its hydraulic lines had been severly damaged and the pilot capt 
al c haynes had almost no control of the aircraft 
fortyone minutes after an explosion at the rear of the plane 
the jet crashed as it tried to land killing at least 109 people 
federal officials say at least 184 people survived 
the pilots controls had stopped working so an offduty united 
pilot who had been sitting with the crew went to the rear of the 
plane after the explosion and saw a footwide hole in the 
horizontal part of the tail the newspaper said 
in their 25minute conversation with the experts the crew of 
flight 232 reported that they could not turn left only right 
the crew reported that the jet had lost hydraulic control no 
elevators ailerons or flaps and the throttle for the damaged 
rear engine could not be moved 
the experts in san francisco seemed doubtful and asked again and 
again what have you lost 
someone listening to the transmissions between the crew and the 
experts interjected how many times do they have to tell them 
that theyve lost all hydraulics the paper reported 
a federal official close to the investigation told the times 
that the pilot once became impatient with the repeated questions 
about the hydraulic problem and said im telling the truth 
the crew flew the jet carrying 293 passengers and crew members 
guiding the plane by increasing and decreasing power to the two 
remaining wingmounted engines the times reported 
as the dc10 approached the sioux city iowa airport the san 
francisco experts kept quiet so as to not disturb the crews 
concentration 
these and other details were disclosed to the times by an 
airline employee familiar with the conversation

indians from the coasts of western 
washington and british columbia crossed puget sound in a flotilla 
of some two dozen traditional canoes on the last leg of the 
paddle to seattle

quileute indian who had made the 179mile trip from lapush on the 
washington coast it makes us proud to be indians hoh and 
quileutes 
the quileutes and hohs from the mouth of the hoh river paddled 
together on the journey which is part of the states centennial 
celebrations the quileutes retraced a route used for trade early 
this century and invited other tribes to join them in what became 
known as the paddle to seattle 
many other tribes took up the invitation and the flotilla on 
the sevenmile trip friday from suquamish to golden gardens in 
north seattle represented canoes from as near as suquamish and as 
far away as bella bella on the british columbia coast 100 miles 
north of vancouver island 
some oceangoing canoes carried as many as 18 people the 
smallest dugout carried a single paddler 
the arrival of the canoes in seattle on friday signaled the

salmon bakes

descendants will still be paddling canoes and not forget they are 
indian 
he said the last large canoe carved by the tulalips was turned 
out 70 years ago and he had to learn the skills of canoebuilding 
as he went jones said he hoped to pass traditions down to others 
of his tribe in a book on building canoes 
others at the gathering said using the canoes was a new 
experience nearly lost in the age of their grandparents 
its a neat experience i never had said roger sullivan a 
port klallam indian its a tradition that will come back i 
hope 
the indians coming the farthest nearly 400 miles were 
members of the heiltsuk nation near bella bella frank brown of 
the heiltsuk said his tribe had issued a challenge to other 
northwest tribes to meet at bella bella four years from now and 
talk about where we want to go as a people 
at least some accepted the challenge 
we gave them a quileute paddle that we have to get back by 
going to bella bella said henry lee morganroth a quileute paddler

relative collapsed 
bring back my son why did you kill my innocent son one 
relative shouted 
the judge described the bombing as atrocious and unethical 
and said kim deserved severe punishment for killing innocent people

sentence because she was duped by north korean leaders defense 
attorney ahn dong il said he and his client would decide within a 
week whether to appeal to the supreme court 
kim admitted in several hearings to bombing the korean air 
boeing 707 that disappeared near burma on nov 29 1987 on its way

1988 summer olympics in seoul 
north korea denied involvement and accused the south of staging 
the bombing to embarrass the north the two koreas have been bitter 
rivals since their land was divided in 1945 and they fought the 
threeyear korean war in 195053

shellfire hit a khmer rouge refugee 
camp on the thaicambodian border for a second day today killing 
up to four people and forcing thousands to flee a un relief 
official said 
the shelling came in two separate morning attacks said patrick 
van de velde deputy director of the un border relief operation 
he cited unconfirmed reports as saying seven people were wounded 
and four killed 
other western officials said provietnamese forces apparently 
staged the attacks as well as shelling friday that killed one 
refugee and wounded 10 others 
the shelling the heaviest ever on site 8 could be intended to 
gain bargaining power at the peace talks to open in paris on 
monday the officials said 
site 8 home to about 40000 cambodians is about 156 miles east 
of bangkok separated from cambodia by sheer rocky cliffs 
populated mostly by women and children it is the main civilian 
camp run by the communist khmer rouge the largest guerrilla group 
fighting the vietnamesesupported army in cambodia 
in the past the khmer rouge has shelled its own camps as part 
of its attempts to exercise strict control over the refugees 
widespread human rights violations have been reported 
van de velde said the refugees first sought shelter from the 
shelling at the base of the cliffs or along a road leading to site 
8 later they all gathered in an open area about a mile further 
inside thailand he said 
we are sending emergency supplies to help them build temporary 
shelters van de velde said 
on friday a 22yearold man was killed and 10 other refugees 
wounded including two small children when 27 or 28 shells crashed 
into the camp a red cross official said 
fighting between provietnamese forces and the khmer rouge has 
increased along the border in recent days as is often the case 
before diplomatic events and peace talks 
the khmer rouge and the other guerrilla groups are to hold talks 
with the vietnaminstalled government in paris next week and 
attend an international conference on cambodia starting july 30 
vietnam invaded cambodia in 1978 and toppled the khmer rouge 
government which had killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians in 
execution chambers and slave labor camps after coming to power in 
1975

the mock invasion of this city on the banks 
of lake superior looked real enough with 100 camouflaged marines 
armed with m16 rifles splashing ashore in amphibious tanks 
but 100 peace activists thought something was missing from 
fridays maneuvers the horror 
the marines dont show the trauma the confusion the effects 
of war said charles wolden of superior wis who served four 
years as a marine in vietnam and 12 years in the us air force 
before retiring from the military 
so when the marines hit the beach at noon and began shooting 
blanks at more than 1000 spectators the peace activists held up a 
representation of the grim reaper and feigned death while others 
moaned and comforted the wounded 
paul broman who spent the day toting signs such as peace 
through strength said he supported the drill part of an annual 
21city great lakes recruiting and training voyage of the uss 
boulder 
i think its great broman said i hope it persuades more 
people to join the marines so we have a safe nation 
when the marines amphibious crafts were just yards from 
landing several protesters broke through a 4foothigh rubber mesh 
fence seven were arrested including an elderly man who tried to 
dodge police but was tackled in lake superior an eighth person was 
arrested before the maneuver 
no injuries were reported 
one of the eight was charged with felony disorderly conduct and 
assault a felony the others were cited on various misdemeanors 
the peace activists used a loudspeaker during the maneuver to 
protest us military actions since world war ii but they 
occasionally were drowned out by chanting marine supporters

a development bank has agreed to loan 
brazil money to begin paving a highway in the western amazon 
ending a twoyear delay caused by environmentalists worried about 
the roads effect on the fragile forest 
william ellis the interamerican development banks 
representative in brazil said friday the bank would finance 40 
percent of the 146 million needed to complete the jungle project 
brazil will receive 80 percent of the money immediately and the 
remainder will be released after the government complies with a 
promise to create indian and forest reserves and control forest 
burning in the region ellis said 
at a presidential palace ceremony thursday planning minister 
joao batista de abreu hailed the highway as a salvation for the 
remote amazon state of acre which borders peru and bolivia about 
2657 miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
work on the highway was suspended in october 1987 when 
completed the 312mile route would link rio branco the capital of 
acre and porto velho the capital rondonia 
the bank which financed the paving of 186 miles of dirt road 
between the two capitals cut off the money under pressure from 
international environmental groups and the us government because 
of widespread cutting and burning of the tropical rainforest 
it later demanded the government take measures to protect the 
rainforest and the estimated 16000 indians that live in the region 
the states of acre and rondonia have been devastated at an 
increasing rate by landless peasants miners and ranchers who slash 
and burn the tropical rainforest and settle there 
environmentalists warn an asphalt roadway would spur an influx 
of settlers and lead to greater ecological destruction and 
disruption of indian communities 
but state authorities in acre the nations poorest and most 
underdeveloped state see the highway as the only way to break the 
states isolation from the rest of the country

supporters of suspended navajo 
chairman peter macdonald are calling for new protests after a rally 
resulted in a violent clash with tribal police that left two dead 
police said they opened fire in selfdefense after being 
attacked thursday by a crowd that numbered more than 300 some 
protesters said the officers fired needlessly 
interim chairman leonard haskie said friday that macdonald 
incited his supporters and was indirectly responsible for the 
fracas which tribal police and the fbi were investigating 
nine people including three police officers were injured 
it is unfortunate that chairman macdonald has resorted to 
tactics contrary to the customs of the navajo people haskie told 
a news conference he has been the architect of the entire 
episode 
witnesses said the demonstration got out of hand when the crowd 
attacked navajo police lt daniel hawkins who led a may 24 sweep 
of the tribes administration building during which macdonald 
appointees and supporters were evicted from offices they had 
refused to leave 
after the shootings about 100 macdonald supporters broke into 
the tribes government complex ransacked it and occupied it for 
about five hours before leaving witnesses said 
i dont feel responsible for the killing because these are 
people who have their own personal feelings macdonald told 
reporters friday his whereabouts during the clash were unknown 
lloyd begay an organizer of the faction that supports 
macdonald said the leadership of the group had debated another 
protest and decided to wait until after the funerals of james 
dickson 57 and arnold lee begay 27 no relation to lloyd begay 
people want to demonstrate now but were advising them not to 
at this time this is a time for mourning begay told the mesa 
tribune 
no funeral dates have been set 
macdonald was placed on administrative leave by the governing 
council of the nations largest indian tribe after allegations at 
us senate hearings in january that he accepted bribes and 
kickbacks he has denied any wrongdoing and followers believe he 
was deposed illegally although tribal courts have upheld the move 
peter macdonald has shown himself to be the most prominent and 
most irresponsible navajo leader said rep morris udall 
dariz chairman of the house interior committee 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr said in washington dc 
that macdonald should leave the reservation for the good of his 
people 
macdonald said at a news conference that the tribal council had 
created a leadership vacuum when it placed him on administrative 
leave feb 13 and that the bureau of indian affairs had acted 
irresponsibly in removing wilbur kellogg who was police chief 
under macdonald 
as the duly elected leader i call for an immediate 
investigation macdonald said 
there were no physical signs of unrest friday although about 50 
people were camped just across the new mexico line large stones 
and shards of glass littered the road running through the tribal 
government complex 
three of the injured remained hospitalized friday in good or 
satisfactory condition

clergy and psychologists are counseling 
the survivors of the united airlines crash many of whom are 
beginning to suffer guilt over failing to save those who died 
at marian health center where 29 victims from united airlines 
flight 232 were hospitalized mental health director marcene moran 
said she and her threemember staff spent friday talking with 
survivors and emergency workers who responded to the disaster 
the crash is really starting to bother them because of some of 
the things theyve seen and the crisis behavior theyve had to 
exhibit to get through this she said 
pilot al haynes and his dc10 crew were among the patients at 
the hospital they are feeling a great deal of sadness at not 
having brought the plane down safely 
they feel responsible said ms moran haynes is credited 
with saving many lives by getting the jet to the edge of a runway 
at sioux gateway airport before crashing were trying to help 
them reach the mind set that they did all they could in the given 
set of circumstances she said 
ms moran said some patients have blotted the wreck out of their 
memories in others initial relief at survival has given way to 
guilt and anger 
some of them are upset that they ran from the plane she 
said one gentleman was angry that he went back but only helped 
one person out when he thought he could have gotten more 
ms moran said she has advised all of the survivors to seek 
psychological counseling when they get home 
many emergency workers at first claim to be suffering no 
emotional trauma but counseling brings out upset she said 
theyve come face to face with a kind of tragedy that most 
people never deal with she said it always brings you to 
confront your own possible death 
the rev mark duchaine a roman catholic priest who has attended 
to the injured and sought to comfort relatives and friends says he 
cant wipe the scene of the crash from his mind 
the carnage at the airport was just unbelievable duchaine 
said 
out there at the airport walking amidst the bodies and the 
debris that just seemed to have disintegrated into millions of 
pieces it was like dantes inferno ill never forget it 
following the wreck duchaine went immediately to the airport 
runway stopping at each body he found to kneel and offer last 
rites since he has worked with the living 
when youre with these families and theyre hurting you wish 
you could take some of that hurt upon yourself said duchaine

propaganda officials called for stricter control 
of the media to protect socialism and education officials today 
said the government was cutting enrollment at colleges where the 
prodemocracy movement was born 
chinas state education commission said freshman university 
enrollment nationwide would be cut by 30000 from the planned 
enrollment of 640000 it said the cut was necessary because many 
schools have been enrolling more students than they could handle 
it also cited problems with job placements and said some 
lowpriority majors including the social sciences need to be 
rectified to be in accordance with the needs of the building 
of socialism 
an admissions official at beijing university who did not give 
his name said the universities and colleges whose students 
actively participated in the student movement will cut enrollment 
beijing university students were at the forefront of the 
nowsuppressed movement for greater freedoms 
an admissions official at peoples university who also did not 
give his name said the cuts were ordered because of the student 
movement and political reasons not because there are any problems 
with the university 
several students at beijing university speaking on condition of 
anonymity also said they felt the enrollment cuts were related to 
the student movement 
the people in charge of chinas propaganda machine meanwhile 
continued to call for a purge of publications that dont toe the 
socialist line 
news and publishing units social science research organs 
literary and art groups must propagate and seriously carry out 
the four basic principles the party newspaper the peoples 
daily said the officials decided 
the four principles in essence declare that china must be ruled 
only by the communist party under the principles of marxism 
leninism and mao tsetung that idea has been part of the 
ideological gospel for a decade under senior leader deng xiaoping 
but tends to be stressed only in times of suppression on emergent 
liberalism 
the officials heads of propaganda departments and cultural 
censors natiowide declared as their fiveday meeting ended friday 
that the cultural market must be rectified meaning shaken up 
and purged of reactionary materials 
beijing and several other leading cities already have begun 
raiding book stalls to seize the works of intellectuals who took 
part in the crushed democracy movement 
the coastal city of fujian announced it has rectified the 
video games market pool halls and dance halls and plans to start 
in on the videotape market 
the message of the propaganda meeting was that such efforts must 
be spread to every town and village and must not stop with a few 
raids as in chinas last hardline political campaign in 1987 
chinas culture minister and vice minister wang meng and ying 
ruochen were conspicuously absent from the meeting as they have 
been since the june 34 army attack on studentled protesters 
wang and ying had advocated a policy that the arts would 
flourish only if political interference was reduced 
the meeting was presided over by the head of the national party 
propaganda department wang renzhi at times joined by party 
general secretary jiang zemin and premier li peng 
an editorial apparently produced by the meeting filled half 
the front page of todays peoples daily it attacked the popular 
view in the west that marxism is outdated and socialism has failed 
as witnessed by the troubled economies and restless populations of 
the soviet union eastern europe and china 
for some time political forces in capitalist countries 
have played up the socalled crisis in socialism it said 
even in china it said some people publicly declare the 
attempt at socialism and its failure is the great legacy of the 
20th century 
the editorial revealed that in early 1987 as china cracked down 
on an earlier series of student marches for democracy nowousted 
party leader zhao ziyang told a party meeting no one really 
knows what the sociaist road is 
in another apparent reference to zhao it said some comrades 
did not speak much of the struggle between socialism and 
capitalism as if with one cry of detente the boundaries between 
socialism and capitalism would be eradicated in reality it is not 
like this 
public criticism of zhao has mounted steadily since his june 24 
ouster from his party posts revelations of comments he allegedly 
made at closed meetings have been cited to prove his softness on 
westernstyle liberalism 
none of the articles explain how zhao managed to win 
confirmation in october 1987 as party chief

the news director of an iowa television 
station threatened to sue other stations if they refused to pay 
extra for exclusive footage of the crash of united airlines flight 
232 
ktivtv in sioux city an nbc affiliate intended the exclusive 
footage of the tumbling burning dc10 jet to be used only by nbc 
nightly news and other nbc affiliates ktiv news director van 
carter said friday 
but it played on other networks affiliates including rival 
kcau in sioux city after it was transmitted from sioux city to nbc 
in new york via a satellite channel owned by minneapolisbased 
conus communications 
for those who didnt ask they are going to get billed 
substantially more than those who did carter said if they 
dont want to pay it then yes we may wind up with legal action 
conus a news service that feeds 133 television stations said 
it obtained the footage from wowt of omaha neb which has a 
reciprocal agreement to share footage with ktiv and was sent to 
transmit the footage to nbc news 
technical and time restraints prompted wowt to use conus 
satellite channel to transmit the video instead of feeding it 
directly to nbc said conus spokesman steve blum 
after being assured by wowt and a ktiv reporter that the two 
stations shared videotapes conus made the video available to its 
members through wowt blum said 
conus later talked to a ktiv manager who granted conus the 
rights to the video for 300 blum said 
we werent trying to rip anybody off blum said we got 
permission 
carter said the situation with conus was confused and that 
conus may not be at fault but he said conus should have checked 
with him not a reporter before releasing the video

the chants of palestinian 
children reciting arabic and practicing multiplication tables rang 
out today from schools in the west bank that were reopened after a 
sevenmonth army closure 
im glad to be going back said 9yearold lina humseyeh as 
she waited for a school bus to take her to her thirdgrade class 
i helped my mother when we didnt have school but i was bored 
the nearly 1200 primary and secondary schools in the occupied 
west bank have been closed for most of the 19month palestinian 
uprising despite appeals from the united states and international 
human rights organizations 
the israeli government contends that the schools are hotbeds of 
violence twice before in may and december of last year the 
army reopened and then closed schools claiming students were 
inciting the uprising 
the schools that opened today are for 200000 children in grades 
one through six and for students in their senior year of high 
school the latter so they can study for mandatory graduation exams 
no major incidents were reported today in several west bank 
cities more troops than normal were seen on main roads 
arab reports said curfews imposed on four villages and a refugee 
camp near nablus and ramallah blocked students from going to 
school three palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with 
soldiers near nablus and in gaza city 
the army confirmed that one palestinian was shot and wounded in 
the nur shams refugee camp outside nablus and said it was checking 
the other reports 
throughout the west bank and gaza strip shops and businesses 
were closed by a general strike ordered by the moslem 
fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal the strike did not affect 
the first day of school because hamas announced in a leaflet that 
it favored children returning to class 
graffiti on a wall outside the united nationsrun school in the 
alamri refugee camp near ramallah also called on students to 
pursue their eductions 
with stones and pens the blessed uprising continues read 
one slogan signed by hamas 
before allowing classes to resume army officials met with 
school administrators and told them they would have to control 
their students or the schools would be closed again 
samira abdullah mahmoud principal of the bethlehem girls 
school said that israeli soldiers who previously parked jeeps 
across from her elementary school today stayed 50 yards away in an 
apparent effort to reduce tensions 
the children become nervous when they see soldiers outside 
she said 
she described the schools 404 elementary schoolgirls as 
obviously happy to be back to make up for the lost school 
time she said the girls will focus on arabic mathematics and 
science electives such as physical education music and art will 
not be taught 
we cant do physical education anyway mrs mahmoud said 
during the closure the soldiers tore down the wall around the 
playground 
residents in the area said that stones the main weapon of the 
uprising had been hurled at passing army jeeps from behind the 
wall 
no date has been set for a resumption of classes for the 
remaining 100000 west bank students in grades seven eight nine 
10 and 11 the army said that would depend on whether the initial 
phase of reopenings was peaceful 
while the army ordered schools closed in the west bank shortly 
after the start of the uprising in december 1987 classes have 
continued for more than 150000 students in the gaza strip 
colleges universities and vocational schools in both 
territories remain shut affecting 20000 students no date for 
reopening them has been set

the pittston coal group inc will respond 
next week to a united mine workers proposal for ending a 15week 
strike the companys president says 
the union made two proposals friday said bruce bratten an 
assistant to umw vice president cecil roberts 
the union would try to address pittstons need for miners to 
work on sundays if pittston gives assurances that any new mines 
opened by the company will employ some of the 4000 pittston 
employees who have been laid off 
the second proposal was a request in writing that the two sides 
meet face to face negotiators have been meeting in separate rooms 
at a motel with federal mediators carrying messages back and forth 
pittston coal president michael odom said there was nothing 
new in the umw proposal 
its hardly a contract proposal odom said if they want 
to play games fine but i thought we were going to see something 
of substance 
but odom said the company would give a definitive response next 
week 
a recess was agreed up for the talks until tuesday amid 
accusations of bad faith on both sides 
its really frustrating bratten said we came in here and 
stated we were willing to stay and continue this on its hard to 
come to an agreement when you cant get someone to sit at a table 
across from you 
the union has charged that pittstons proposals would undermine 
umw members job security and hopes of future coal employment 
umw miners in virginia and west virginia struck pittston on 
april 5 and the companys kentucky operations were struck in june 
about 1900 miners are on strike in the three states 
thousands of others miners throughout the east joined in a 
monthlong wildcat strike that ended last week 
meanwhile 42 people were charged with conspiracy to commit a 
felony following a rockthrowing incident in dickenson county in 
southwest virginia those charged allegedly pelted a state trooper 
with rocks

michael adams a 17yearold british chess player 
won an international competition in london and is expected to be 
the third youngest player in history to be awarded a grandmaster 
title 
adams scored seven points out of nine in the iclicki masters 
tournament on friday to achieve his third grandmaster performance 
in less than a year he is expected to have his new title ratified 
by the international chess federation at its annual congress next 
month in puerto rico 
british chess experts said bobby fischer of the united states 
and the current world champion soviet garri kasparov are the only 
players to have gained chess top honor at an earlier age fischer 
who held the world title from 1972 to 1975 became a grandmaster at 
15 kasparov did that at 16 
to the best of my knowledge michael is third said malcolm 
pein a british international master and chess writer 
after agreeing to a draw in his final round game adams said he 
was drained but added things have gone very well recently 
hes extremely talented if he can fulfill his potential he 
will reach the highest echelons of world chess said jonathan 
speelman a british grandmaster who has reached the semifinal 
stage of the world championship and trains with adams 
adams is registered as a high school student in truro in 
southwest england but admits to taking increasing amounts of time 
off to play in tournaments 
he has competed in the united states and australia and his chess 
prowess netted 17000 in prize money last year now he will be 
eligible for the hefty appearance monies regularly offered to 
grandmasters 
adams said he practises very little at home and prefers to 
work on his game with a partner you always get a lot more done 
and far more objective opinions with two he said 
away from chess adams likes pop music television traveling 
abroad and meeting with friends he also likes to surf along the 
cornish coastline 
just flat board nothing spectacular he said i would 
probably be on a beach in cornwall if i wasnt playing here 
he was taught the moves at the age of eight by his father a 
teacher and went on to win the british under11 championship 
at 12 he shot to fame when he was the only junior to hold 
kasparov to a draw during an exhibition of simultaneous chess games 
adams ranking might be threatened by other juniors joel 
lautier a french 15yearold has achieved two of the required 
three grandmaster performances 
and judit polgar 13 the youngest member of a remarkable trio 
of hungarian sisters missed her first grandmaster result at a 
tournament in new york in the spring by just half a point 
there are more opportunities now adams said there is so 
much more around for players at a younger age

poaching of elephants and rhinoceroses 
has increased dramatically since the withdrawal of south african 
army units a police official said today 
chief inspector kierie du rand said the territorial police force 
has formed three antipoaching units to try to fill the void 
created after nearly all south african troops left earlier this 
year as part of a unsupervised plan to bring independence to 
namibia 
he said the units consisted mainly of black constables who 
formerly served in koevoet a counterinsurgency force active in the 
23year bush war against guerrillas of swapo the southwest africa 
peoples organization many koevoet members were expert trackers 
police have reported the arrest of 30 suspected poachers in the 
past six weeks but wildlife experts say stronger measures are 
needed to halt the smuggling of ivory and rhino horns out of 
namibia 
according to the south africanbased rhino and elephant 
foundation at least 11 black rhinos and 30 elephants have been 
killed by poachers in namibia since june the black rhino is one of 
the most endangered species of large mammals with only about 3500 
believed to exist worldwide 
two months ago namibian conservationists began an unprecedented 
experimental program to deter rhino poachers by removing the horns 
of some of the animals the horns can earn thousands of dollars for 
smugglers from buyers in asia who use them to make potions and 
dagger handles 
some conservationists have complained that the un military and 
police contingents observing the independence process in namibia 
are uninterested in assisting wildlife protection programs 
the poaching issue was among several topics discussed friday 
during talks in pretoria between south african foreign minister pik 
botha and un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
south africa which took control of namibia during world war i 
has agreed to grant independence as part of a regional peace accord 
that also calls for withdrawal of cuban troops from angola 
namibias northern neighbor

vacation in northern italy by visiting a show of soviet art 
the pope visited the exhibit friday in turin on his way back to 
rome from introd an alpine town near the french border where he 
had spent his vacation hiking and relaxing 
a quick visit but some impressions remain the polishborn 
pontiff said after viewing the show of 260 works created from 1870 
to 1930 there is the russian and soviet history but one also 
sees the religious influence particularly of the icons 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the pope accepted the 
invitation to see the exhibit because it is an exposition of 
russian and soviet art a visit therefore that assumes a 
significance of opening in the point of view of the holy father 
for whom europe goes from the atlantic to the urals 
relations between the vatican and moscow have been improving in 
recent years the pope has said he would like to visit the soviet 
union but only if he could go to lithuania and other heavily

42 days a year with more time offered to miners working in

the pilot implored controllers to keep 
crippled flight 232 away from the city while an offduty pilot 
struggled on his knees with the throttle to help gain control of 
the jetliner investigators said 
as the national transportation safety board tried to determine 
the cause of the explosion that led to the crash of the united 
dc10 on wednesday ntsb spokesman jim burnett recounted friday 
night some of the final minutes before the jetliner cartwheeled and 
exploded into flames 
an offduty pilot offered his assistance after the rear engine 
blew apart and the jets hydraulic lines were severed limiting the 
planes maneuverability the hydraulic system is routed through the 
tail and allows the pilot to manipulate wing and tail controls 
the offduty pilot whom burnett did not identify was allowed 
into the cockpit to help the copilot wrest control of the crippled 
plane 
the washington post identified the offduty pilot as dennis 
fitch who was listed as a survivor by united 
the only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine 
thrust burnett said the offduty pilot was on his knees 
manipulating the throttle 
what you have here is a situation of two men desperately 
trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft he 
said 
seven minutes before he attempted an emergency landing at sioux 
gateway airport pilot al c haynes told the control tower 
whatever you do keep us away from the city burnett quoted 
haynes as telling investigators during two onehour interviews on 
friday the airport is about seven miles from downtown 
city manager hank sinda said this morning that one of the 
injured victims whom he did not name died overnight bringing the 
death toll to 110 by his count there were 186 survivors 
earlier burnett had said 297 people were on board two more 
than earlier reports and that 186 survived including one woman 
who has not been identified burnett did not say why she had not 
been identified 
united airlines late friday revised its list of survivors and 
brought its total to 187 united said 109 people died while the 
ntsb figures indicated a death toll of 111 united has not yet 
released a list of victims 
a flight attendant rene lebeau was listed as missing 
according to the association of flight attendants ten crew members 
survived 
fortysix survivors remained hospitalized their conditions 
range from critical to good 
meanwhile iowa national guardsmen and investigators from the 
fbi and the state department of criminal investigation continued to 
look for wreckage around sioux gateway airport they planned to 
lift a large blackened section of the fuselage lying in a 
cornfield along the scorched runway where haynes brought the 
crippled jumbo jet down 
investigators on friday narrowed their focus to the tail of the 
jetliner and a blown rear engine that may have spewed pieces of 
metal like shrapnel wrecking the jets steering system 
the engines manufacturer general electric co said its ge 
aircraft engines division sent a fivemember team to help 
investigate 
the crew of flight 232 tried to get advice from the airlines 
experts in san francisco when iowa officials on the ground couldnt 
help them the new york times reported the crisis aboard the dc10 
bound for chicago from denver was so unusual that it took the 
experts 10 minutes to understand the problems severity even then 
they offered no solutions the newspaper reported today 
in their 25minute conversation with the experts the crew 
reported that they could only turn right 
they reported that the jet had lost hydraulic control no 
elevators ailerons or flaps and the throttle for the damaged 
rear engine could not be moved 
a federal official close to the investigation told the times 
that the pilot once became impatient with the repeated questions 
about the hydraulic problem and said im telling the truth 
abc news reported friday that the navigational system at the 
airport where the pilot was trying to land the plane had been 
turned off 
glenn bush a federal aviation administration manager in des 
moines said the system was scheduled to be shut down at noon on 
wednesday about four hours before the crash for maintenance 
according to a federal aviation guide the sioux airport has a 
vortac navigational system which gives pilots the bearing and 
range of an airport pilots use the information to check whether 
they are on course 
bush said all pilots were notified of the shutdown weeks before 
and said it would probably not have been of use in any case 
investigators also were reviewing maintenance records on the 
15yearold jet burnett said repair work involving the rear engine 
was done on the plane the day before the crash to correct a 
problem with the pneumatic system 
the pneumatic system uses excess pressure generated by the giant 
engine to power the aircrafts airconditioning system burnett 
said he did not think that problem would have affected the engine 
itself

because of the arrangement of japans electoral districts a 
rural vote is calculated as weighing up to six times as much as an 
urban vote in sundays election for half the seats in parliaments 
upper house 
it is the first election since the formation of the liberal 
democratic party in 1955 that farmers who have always been loyal 
to the ruling party so loudly expressed opposition to the ldp 
said takayoshi miyagawa president of seiji koho center a 
prominent research firm 
in the past he said farmers opposition to certain policies 
has not translated into votes for the opposition 
last month however a socialist party homemaker defeated an ldp 
candidate in an upper house byelection in niigata prefecture 
japans largest ricegrowing district 
without the farmers rebellion against the ldp the socialist 
candidate couldnt have won in niigata which is traditionally a 
conservative stronghold said masumi ishikawa a political 
commentator for the national newspaper asahi shimbun 
like many other japanese he added farmers were unhappy with 
the 3 percent sales tax that took effect in april making their 
fertilizer and farm equipment more expensive 
what angered farmers most however was the governments timid 
attitude toward us demands to open japans agricultural markets 
wider said yasushi akiba an official at agricultural cooperatives 
in yamagata in northern japan 
japan already the best foreign customer for american farmers 
has agreed to remove quotas on imported beef and oranges in 1991 
it also opened its market to 10 other farm products after an 
international trade body upheld a us complaint 
japanese farming is not yet competitive enough to stand 
against foreign products said tokuo matsumoto executive 
director of the central union of agricultural cooperatives the 
most powerful farm lobby simply exposing japans agriculture to 
foreign competition at this point will permanently jeopardize this 
countrys agriculture 
the cooperatives prefectural organ in yamagata has decided not 
to support the local ldp candidate 
there is a sense of crisis mounting among farmers about the 
future of japans agriculture said akiba we have long 
supported the ldp but we cant find party policies to protect us 
we are concerned such a weak stance by the ldp may eventually 
sacrifice japans rice market 
at least 17 local farm lobby groups have officially decided not 
to endorse ldp candidates three of them are endorsing their own 
candidates to run against the governing party 
it is unclear to what extent farmers might turn to opposition 
parties 
farmers are aware that the socialists cannot necessarily 
protect them either said ishikawa it is yet to be seen if 
they will actually go into the voting booth and write socialist 
party members names

chinas economy which suffered from political 
turmoil that turned major cities into battlegrounds remains 
weakened even though workers have left the barricades for the 
assembly lines 
thousands of hours of production time were lost beijing alone 
suffered 348 million in unspecified direct losses according 
to city officials 
the state which ran a 21 billion budget deficit last year 
suddenly faced the unbudgeted cost of transporting armies and tanks 
to beijing and repairing the damage caused by several days of 
warfare between soldiers and angry crowds early last month 
the country finds itself less equipped than ever to deal with 
its ecomomic problems 
outside help has dwindled most of chinas lenders have frozen 
aid or postponed consideration of new loans while they watch 
political developments trade and investment may also fall off as 
foreign businessmen weigh possible profits against the political 
uncertainties 
debate in economic theory as in other fields has been 
silenced and several leading economic think tanks face government 
rectification after having sided with nowousted communist 
party chief zhao ziyang 
reform measures favored by zhao such as widening chinas tiny 
but flourishing private sector increasing stock sales by 
stateowned companies and streamlining oversized work forces have 
been discredited 
instead the aging revolutionary veterans who returned to center 
stage against zhao are calling for hard work plain living and 
selfreliance there is no more talk of price reform although even 
official news reports agree that chinas semicontrolled price 
system is in chaos 
a recent article in the economic daily made the new emphasis 
clear 
privatization of china is likely to reduce social development 
in terms of education culture hygiene environmental protection 
and social welfare wrote fang jue a researcher at the chinese 
academy of social sciences 
recent government policies he said put the public economy at 
a disadvantaged position losing ground to the private sector that 
is what we are going to reform 
the leaders also have begun a crackdown on corruption which at 
least one western economist said may have been the only thing that 
kept some markets functioning 
in some industries such as steel the stateset price is too low 
to cover costs and black market sales have become essential said 
the economist speaking on condition of anonymity 
perhaps most important the political shakeup has pushed 
economic problems to second place from the top leadership down 
officials and scholars have been preoccupied with implementing the 
new political line and rooting out westernstyle liberalism 
but the western economist said dwelling on party line is a 
mistake 
it is a time to worry about the economy the economist said 
a decade of unprecedented growth produced by senior leader deng 
xiaopings policy of reducing central planning has foundered in a 
mire of raw material shortages energy shortfalls distribution 
bottlenecks wild spending rising prices and stagnant productivity 
since september the government has managed to cut inflation 
from a high of about 36 percent to an annual rate of 255 percent 
by reining in bank credit and reimposing control over some freed 
prices 
it halted thousands of construction projects and curbed the 
growth of small collectiveowned factories that were siphoning 
materials and energy away from the state sector it ordered 
officials to stop buying cars and other perks and raised taxes on 
imports 
but the austerity measures have created new problems tens of 
thousands of peasants who came to the cities on construction teams 
have been sent home without alternative jobs a policy some 
economists criticized before the political crackdown 
new price controls have contributed to an average 12 percent 
drop in profits of stateowned enterprises which employ 
threefourths of chinas urban work force oil coal and other 
major industries are the worst hit the peoples daily said 
chinas infant auto industry is reeling under a state ban on new 
car purchases by most government units 
the financial situation is still quite serious government 
spokesman yuan mu acknowledged at a recent news conference 
agriculture appears to be one bright spot 
the serious drought of the past two years has ended in most 
areas and the summer grain harvest is up slightly from last year 
to 93 million tons the government is predicting a record harvest 
for the year of 410 million tons 
even this good news has a dark side most grain must be sold to 
the state and the better the harvest the more cash the government 
needs to buy it in may the ministry of commerce said it had only 
half the 54 billion needed to buy the summer harvest 
since then newspapers have reported that purchases are going 
smoothly and have not said if the state has resorted to printing 
more money as it did last year the only alternative is to issue 
ious 
it did that last year causing widespread discontent that the 
government could do without now

the federal governments exportimport bank 
reported saturday that it reduced both its losses and the us 
exports it supported in the year that ended last sept 30 
the annual report included renewed criticism from comptroller 
general charles a bowsher head of the congressional general 
accounting office he said the bank has failed to make any 
allowance for what his office considers the uncollectible portion 
of 116 billion owed to it the statement dated april 9 did not 
say how much was considered uncollectible 
bowshers staff has cited old loans counted by the bank as 
assets even though they have been repudiated by china and the 
government of president fidel castro in cuba 
the bank is extremely cautious about writing off loans and 
guarantees to governments because we believe these sovereign 
risk loans and guarantees will be repaid said a statement in the 
report by acting president william f ryan and james k hess the 
banks treasurer 
bowsher wrote that because of its continued losses the banks 
reserve was in deficit for the first time ever the bank put that 
deficit at 1164 million 
a separate report by the bank on its international 
competitiveness said american business people judged it generally 
less than competitive in competing with other industrial 
governments in making loans repayable in over five years it was 
seen as basically competitive for shorter term loans 
it supported longterm credit for about 710 million worth of 
business in 1988 compared with 537 billion worth supported by 
france 177 billion by italy 113 billion by west germany and 
730 million by britain 
the banks major job in recent years has been to encourage sales 
of american industrial goods by helping foreign buyers borrow the 
money needed to purchase them it makes direct loans itself and 
guarantees loans by commercial banks so they can offer lower 
interest other governments have similar agencies for supporting 
their exports 
it supported 6535 billion worth of sales in 1988 compared 
with 9265 billion worth the year before it cut its net loss to 
4282 million from the previous years 4609 million it has been 
losing money through the 1980s 
the losses in recent years stem mainly from longterm loans 
made to foreign borrowers in the latter 1970s and early 1980s at 
interest rates significantly below the banks cost of funds in 
order to help us exporters meet foreign competition ryan said 
in the annual report 
that subsidy will ultimately amount to about 1 percent of 
total exports supported not a very heavy price for the american 
job growth and industrial competitiveness those exports achieved

the national elks organization will 
consider this week whether to welcome women into the allmale 
preserve but the proposals sponsor says he wasnt motivated by a 
desire for equality between the sexes 
retired air force lt col hal detrick says his resolution 
approved by the jonesboro lodge was prompted instead by the 
fraternal organizations declining membership and the resignation 
from the local chapter of a federal judicial nominee under senate 
scrutiny 
i could see then that any young lawyer or young aspiring 
politician who might aspire to be anything within the federal 
government might be reluctant to become a member of the elks and 
we do too much good work to make it an albatross around any young 
persons neck detrick 67 said last week during an interview 
the resolution is to be submitted thursday at the 125th national 
convention of the 15 millionmember benevolent and protective 
order of the elks in new orleans it would delete the word male 
from the groups national membership requirements which specify 
a male citizen of the united states of america 
did detricks proposal approved by the jonesboro chapter by a 
twothirds vote in march arouse emotion 
passion no words yes detrick said the first person 
who talked to me said hal what are you trying to do and i 
explained exactly what i was trying to do 
in st george utah a woman who was rejected for elks 
membership filed in 1987 a sex discrimination lawsuit which still 
is pending and while the elks do have some black members 
nationally several california lodges threatened legal action if 
rules were not changed to allow more minority representation in the 
groups 2300 lodges 
no woman has tried to join the 90yearold jonesboro 
organization which also has no black members said jonesboro 
exalted ruler clyde harcrow 56 the equivalent of local president 
candidates must be nominated by a member and undergo background 
checks and interviews with questions that might include whether 
the nominees use illegal drugs or believe in the us constitution 
and god harcrow said 
votes on prospective members are by secret ballot 
detricks resolution says elks membership policies were subject 
to undeserved criticism during the february 1988 confirmation 
hearings for stephen m reasoner of jonesboro now a federal judge 
reasoners memberships in the jonesboro elks and masonic lodges 
were criticized by sen howard metzenbaum dohio who accused the 
organizations of discriminating against women and blacks 
in a letter to metzenbaum disclosing his resignation from both 
groups reasoner wrote i want to reiterate that i do not do this 
out of a belief that these organizations are racially 
discriminatory 
but he said it was preferable to resign to remove this 
issue from consideration of his nomination 
detricks resolution also says that a member of this states 
congressional delegation has shown reluctance to risk unfavorable 
publicity if he should pursue membership in this lodge 
detrick would not identify the congressman jonesboro is 
represented by democrat bill alexander who said through a 
spokesman that he is not a member of the elks and did not recall 
seeking membership 
the 1300 members of the jonesboro elks down from about 2000 
a decade ago provide scholarships each year to several arkansas 
state university students raise money for a staterun center 
serving developmentally disabled children foot the bill for a 
hotlunch program for senior citizens and deliver birthday cakes 
to nursing homes harcrow said 
harcrow said he will vote for detricks resolution at the 
national convention because a majority of his members favored it 
neither harcrow nor detrick would predict whether it would pass 
but detrick said it might be difficult to persuade members to 
change the rules 
when it comes time to vote for or against this its a secret 
ballot just like when we vote on a prospective member detrick 
said 
several members since i made the proposal have said hey 
its coming sooner or later we might as well do it now and its 
better to do it rather than be forced to do it

beijings suppression of its prodemocracy 
movement has derailed chinas opening to the west and prompted 
speculation its economy could enter a new period of stagnation 
including foreign exchange shortages and limited contacts between 
chinese and foreign businesses 
hong kong newspapers are filled with reports about postponed 
projects some involving hundreds of millions of dollars since the 
government crushed the prodemocracy movement early last month 
the world bank has halted consideration of about 230 million in 
loans and the asian development bank has delayed decisions on 
about 1 billion japan also has expressed concern over its plan to 
lend china 56 billion 
in terms of investment china is basically dead said a 
western diplomat in terms of trade they arent dead yet but 
theyre dying its a sad story but they did it to themselves 
businessmen and diplomats interviewed in hong kong say chinas 
economic modernization plan has stalled despite statements to the 
contrary by communist party chief jiang zemin 
they point to recent editorials in the chinese press criticizing 
private industry the most active sector of the economy and to 
claims that chinese operators of joint ventures have been told to 
limit contact with foreigners 
no one will talk to me on the mainland anymore said an 
american business consultant who spent three years in china before 
moving to hong kong 
its back to the days of spy vs spy he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
businessmen and diplomats also criticize beijings campaign 
against official corruption a major impediment to doing business 
in china as a cosmetic gesture after the chinese military 
crackdown left hundreds of people dead 
foreign traders say they will take a much more cautious approach 
toward china 
john hu who runs an importexport company in hong kong sold 4 
million in cigarette filters and television picture tubes to china 
about two weeks ago 
before he would have signed bigger longerterm contracts 
im doing business on a casebycase basis he said i say 
to them if you guys dont have the foreign exchange youre not 
going to see the material 
western diplomats predict that chinas current foreign exchange 
reserves of 17 billion could be gone by next year especially if 
its appetite for foreign goods continues in the first five months 
of 1989 imports jumped 25 percent while exports increased only 5 
percent 
observers say there are some opportunities for the shortterm 
commodities traders say recent business has been brisk as china 
moves to make up for the predicted drop in investment by selling 
some products cut rate 
an official from a large japanese company in hong kong said 
chinese have signed several multimilliondollar contracts in recent 
weeks in an attempt to purchase goods before the foreign exchange 
crunch begins and on monday china signed a contract with an 
american firm giving it the right to lease chinese land to foreign 
investors 
but analysts said these opportunities appear to be shortlived 
the good deals will only last as long as chinas foreign 
exchange holds out which wont be that long said robert 
broadfoot a hong kongbased business analyst the deal makers 
involved in the bigger projects like investments are taking a 
very big risk 
broadfoot said many of his clients are canceling investment 
projects or putting plans on hold 
those people who were just getting interested in china are 
backing out broadfoot said for those who are already in 
there they have no choice but to protect what theyve got 
the stakes are high 
according to chinese figures china in 1988 did about 80 
billion of trade a rise of 166 percent from 1987 
the crackdown on the prodemocracy demonstrators also has handed 
chinas fledgling legal system a major defeat legal experts said 
the shooting of unarmed citizens in beijing made a mockery of law 
by blatantly distorting facts and manipulating law and legal 
institutions they have devalued the currency of not only their 
countrys domestic legislation but also its international 
agreements international lawyer jerome cohen wrote in a recent 
essay 
in the eyes of foreign individuals companies and governments 
all these actions make china a riskier place a less trustworthy 
partner he added 
before the crackdown signs of change had emerged in chinas 
legal sphere 
cohen cited a case early this year involving several chinese 
firms that were raided and fined for assembling copycat ibm 
products 
an ibm spokesman had said the action had encouraged the company 
to invest in china but since the crackdown ibm has cut its 
foreign staff in beijing by approximately 40 percent said a 
company source

pakistan has developed technology 
to outfit usmade f16 fighter jets with nuclear weapons a 
report said saturday 
der spiegel magazine quoting unidentified west german 
intelligence officials said pakistan developed sophisticated 
computer and electronic technology to make it possible for its 
f16s to carry nuclear bombs 
spiegel which is based in hamburg said that since pakistan 
developed the technology washington has approved the delivery of 
60 new f16s to pakistan according to spiegel the planes 
delivered to pakistan did not contain the electronic components 
needed to allow the jets to carry nuclear payloads but the 
magazine said pakistan has since been able to develop the systems 
itself 
pakistan has denied widespread reports it has nuclear weapons 
its prime minister benazir bhutto offered to open pakistans 
nuclear facilities to international inspection but only if its 
traditional rival india does the same indias prime minister 
rajiv gandhi has refused to do so 
spiegel also quoted unidentified sources in bonn as saying that 
the government is upset about washingtons sale of f16s to 
pakistan because us officials have criticized similar west german 
exports to other countries 
they put us in the accused dock while they go ahead and do 
business spiegel quoted a government official as saying 
a summary of spiegels report which will appear in its monday 
edition was telexed to other news media in advance 
west germanys export laws have been under intense criticism for 
loopholes that have allegedly allowed shipments of sensitive 
materials to countries with purported plans to use them for 
military purposes 
the biggest scandal occurred late last year after us 
allegations that west german firms were linked to a chemical 
weapons production facility in libya 
west germany first insisted there was no proof of the american 
claims but later west germany launched its own criminal 
investigation that resulted in the arrest of the head of a chemical 
firm on suspicion of violating export laws

any outsider thinking about running for 
congress better plan on spending more than a quarter of a million 
dollars or forget about it according to a campaign finance study 
released saturday 
even then a challenger would face long odds and probably still 
could not raise more money than an incumbent said the study of the 
1988 elections by the center for responsive politics 
house challengers who spent between 250000 and 500000 
found the odds against them to be 11to1 on election day said 
larry makinson the author of the study even those who spent 
more than half a million dollars had only one chance in six of 
winning 
he added that those who spent less than 250000 had a perfect 
record they all lost 
in the senate the average election last year cost 3 million 
according to the study 
last year 98 percent of the house members running for 
reelection won while in the senate 85 percent of the incumbents 
running were successful 
the study is based largely on computerized financial information 
compiled by the federal election commission but it also compares 
that data with voting statistics and historical material 
even if a challenger did manage to raise a lot of money the 
incumbent would just raise more 
in house races where the challenger spent 100000 to 250000 
the incumbent spent an average of 520255 if the challenger spent 
more than 500000 the incumbent spent an average of 904704 
according to the study 
still having deep pockets is no guarantee of a seat in the 
house of the 10 biggestspending challengers only one new york 
democrat nita lowey won an election and she spent more than 13 
million 
the average financial lead of incumbents over challengers has 
widened over the last few years from 172002 in 1986 to 264104 
last year in 1974 the gap was just 16532 and in relative 
terms the challengers have been losing ground the study said 
i think the reason is people are seeing it is a very bad 
investment for half a million dollars makinson said 
the center for responsive politics is nonpartisan group funded 
by private foundations that does research on congressional and 
political trends

kenneth w starr is looking forward to his 
first supreme court argument as the federal governments 
topranking courtroom lawyer but he is weary of speculation that 
his role in such sessions might someday be as a high court member 
willing to discuss in cautious terms such politically 
sensitive issues as abortion and flagburning in a recent interview 
with the associated press starr drew the line at talking about a 
supreme court nomination 
im not going to comment at all on anything with respect to 
the future my job is right here and im terribly occupied with 
the here and now said the former federal appellate judge who two 
months ago became the bush administrations solicitor general 
during senate confirmation hearings earlier this year starr was 
asked why he would leave his appeals court seat with its lifetime 
tenure for a job that could last just four years he said the 
justice department job was a great privilege he could not turn 
down 
when sen arlen specter rpa inquired whether a possible 
supreme court nomination had been discussed starr said it had not 
there was no arrangement no understanding of any kind whatsoever 
and indeed no discussion of any such matter starr testified 
but a judges life clearly appeals to starr 43 i very much 
enjoyed being a judge he told the associated press of his five 
years on the us circuit court of appeals in washington i was 
immensely professionally satisfied with being a judge 
but as solicitor general starr is a player not a referee eager 
for the contest 
his first supreme court appearance will come next fall in a case 
growing out of efforts to racially desegregate yonkers ny 
four yonkers city councilmen are seeking to overturn fines 
imposed against them for initially defying a federal judges order 
to adopt a housing desegregation plan the city had been sued by 
the federal government 
starr will argue that the judge did not exceed his authority in 
assessing the fines 
its a very important case which raises quite fundamental 
issues starr said there are certain cases that lend 
themselves to being argued by the solicitor general personally 
this struck me as one in that category 
the fact that starr will argue on the side supported by civil 
rights activists is in stark contrast to several of the 
highprofile cases argued by his predecessor charles fried 
criticized by those who said he was too willing to mix litigation 
with conservative politics 
in supreme court appearances as solicitor general in the 
administration of former president reagan fried vigorously opposed 
broad use of affirmative action and expansive interpretation of 
civil rights law 
starr said he has the highest respect and affection for 
charles and added im not going to comment on aspects of 
practice when i was not here 
while noting it is appropriate for white house officials to 
contact him and his staff about supreme court cases in which 
president bush is interested starr said i think every solicitor 
general has to be prepared to follow the dictates of his 
conscience informed by his professional judgment 
if he cannot in conscience subscribe to a particular legal 
position he is duty bound as an officer of the court not to 
advance it starr said 
will the bush administration seek to participate in the three 
abortion rights cases to be argued before the supreme court when 
its new term begins in october 
that is uncertain starr said adding that the final 
determination will be made by attorney general dick thornburgh 
this is a unique case of obvious importance 
starr refused to say whether he agrees with thornburghs support 
for a constitutional amendment to overcome the supreme courts june 
decision that burning the american flag is a constitutionally 
protected form of political protest 
im going to stay completely out of it that is now in the 
political arena starr said 
asked about his first reaction to the courts decision starr 
said it was not a surprise to me that the court would conclude 
that this was symbolic speech protected under the first amendment 
that was not a surprise 
a justice department priority under former attorney general 
edward meese iii had been finding the appropriate case in which to 
ask the supreme court to overturn its 1966 decision in miranda vs 
arizona 
in it the court required police to warn criminal suspects of 
their right to remain silent and to have a lawyers help before 
answering any questions 
overturning the miranda ruling is not a bush administration 
priority starr indicated 
if in fact the law enforcement apparatus of the federal 
government felt that any issue was one of concern and vexation to 
them thats something that would have to be weighed and analyzed 
at that time i simply am aware of no sense in the administration 
of a call to overrule the miranda decision

looking back its easy to spot the little ironies garry priest 
had called his mother to tell her he loved her bill entrup had 
been turned away because the plane was overbooked 
garry never does that jeri priest thought later when she 
heard the news about flight 232 bill entrup had thought wait a 
minute thats my ticket 
but earlier wednesday when the dc10 had thundered down the 
runway at stapleton international airport and lifted into the clear 
denver sky there was no reason to think twice about those things 
at that point united flight 232 was just another twohour hop to 
chicago 
priest a 23yearold communications specialist for a denver 
restaurant chain was going to chicago on business mark gearhart 
a colorado veterinarian was heading to ohio for his 15th high 
school reunion ruth gomez of bloomfield nm was taking her 
three children to visit their grandfather in maine 
altogether there were 285 or 286 passengers the precise 
number remains in dispute and 11 crew members on board 
miraculously 186 people survived when flight 232 ended in flames 
in an iowa cornfield tragically at least 110 people died 
garry priest lived mark gearhart died paul and leah gomez 
lived their mother ruth and brother john died 
experts can offer explanations for why some lived and some died 
basically it comes down to seat location and blind luck but its 
doubtful that will ever mean much to garry priest or paul and leah 
gomez 
the trouble started at 316 pm cdt 
the flight was about 1 hours out of denver some of the 
passengers were watching a sports videotape on the planes movie 
screens others were talking reading sleeping 
suddenly there was an explosion from the rear of the plane that 
knocked the flight attendants to the floor and then recalled 
david landsberger a businessman from caldwell nj we were 
going down 
jerome milford an indianapolis accountant returning from a 
colorado vacation said it was like going on an elevator and 
going down too fast we were losing altitude and they told us 
theyd lost an engine 
in the cockpit capt al c haynes who flew in the korean war 
and had been a united pilot for 33 years was telling air traffic 
controllers in minneapolis that the jet had lost an engine and was 
losing altitude one minute later he reported a complete 
hydraulic failure of the jets steering system the minneapolis 
tower told him to take the plane to dubuque iowa 
the federal aviation administration later discovered that a fan 
was missing from the tail engine it apparently had exploded 
slicing through the hydraulic steering system 
at 320 haynes declared an emergency and the flight was 
rerouted to sioux city iowa haynes told passengers that the plane 
had lost an engine and would be late 
at 330 some field workers were returning from a coffee break 
at alta iowa 60 miles east of sioux city when they discovered an 
8foot by 12foot section of the plane in a soybeanandcorn field 
they notified local authorities 
ten minutes after that haynes got on the planes public address 
system again and announced that the jets tail section was damaged 
the flight would make an emergency landing in sioux city he said 
he sounded a little stressed landsberger recalled some 
passengers were beginning to get hysterical although most remained 
calm 
at one point recalled jerome milford a copilot came 
back and looked out over the wing of the plane and he was very 
concerned also we were hoping it would just be a soft landing and 
that we would walk away and think nothing of it but that wasnt 
the case 
passenger ron rhode of marysville ohio noticed that an 
8yearold boy ben radtke of prairie view ill was traveling 
alone rhode moved to the seat next to him 
in the cockpit the crew was becoming desperate if youve got 
any ideas we could use them one crew member told ground 
controllers a pilot in another plane heard this message over his 
radio we need an airport an interstate a gravel road a field 
were coming down someplace 
as they approached sioux city landsberger said the plane was 
rocking from side to side haynes was trying to steer the jet by 
controlling the speed of his remaining wingmounted engines flight 
attendants told passengers to read the emergency instructions in 
the seat pocket in front of them and ran them through a practice 
drill 
they told us to keep our seatbelts fastened tightly and to put 
our heads between our legs about four minutes before we crashed 
they told us to brace ourselves landsberger said 
as the plane approached for a landing at sioux gateway airport 
haynes repeated the order brace brace brace 
we really thought we were going to make it passenger debbie 
belliveau said 
at 358 the plane skimmed toward the runway pitched violently 
to its right scraped its right wing and cartwheeled across the 
runway exploding into flames it landed in a cornfield shattered 
in pieces 
i was peeking if you will and i saw us hit said passenger 
charlie martz a private pilot from castle rock colo i closed 
my eyes and hoped with a pillow over my head 
we rolled upside down and inside out and every which way the 
plane broke into three pieces and bodies all over the place 
hanging upside down 
i unfastened my belt and dropped a little ways finally i 
saw what i thought was an open window but there were flames i 
said to hell with it im going for it and i went through the 
flames i cant believe it there were people with feet missing and 
arms missing its the goddamndest thing ive ever seen in my 
life 
ron rhode and another passenger danny surge of chicago were 
with young bed radtke the plane hit and bounced then flipped 
and spun around so we ended up upside down rhode said i let 
go and asked dan for the kid 
surge handed ben to rhode who shoved him out the plane 
i thought i was going to die ben said later still 
clutching a united airlines button and a pair of plastic pilots 
wings 
landsberger said that after the plane stopped sliding we just 
all walked out into a cornfield i was a little dazed i do know 
that i probably stepped on some people or something as we were 
walking out but i knew if we stopped wed all get bottled up 
sevenyearold paul gomez had been sitting with his 10yearold 
brother john his 4yearold sister leah and his 35yearold 
mother ruth 
after the crash as he and leah fled the burning plane paul 
said he heard his brother yelling that he was stuck 
nobody would help him paul said mom tried 
she and john gomez were listed among the unconfirmed dead 
when garry priest stepped out of the wreckage he said the 
runway looked like a war zone bodies trash magazines luggage 
and pieces of bodies littered the area it was the worst thing ive 
ever seen 
but the evacuation was real organized he said everybody 
was just saying ok folks lets take our time lets just walk 
out and we did 
people on the ground couldnt believe their eyes nobody could 
walk away from a crash like that nobody but there they were 
bruised and burned and amazed as anybody that they could be alive 
they will always wonder why

william c lucas the bush administrations 
embattled nominee for chief civil rights enforcer came up with a 
novel reply last week when senators asked him his views on recent 
supreme court rulings 
im new to the law said the 61yearold former sheriff 
drawing a gasp from onlookers and sending the nomination deeper 
into doubt within a day rep john conyers dmich withdrew his 
support and two senators who had been leaning toward lucas turned 
noticeably cool 
lucas performance at his confirmation hearing provided new 
ammunition for civil rights groups who claim he lacks the 
experience to head the 151lawyer civil rights division of the 
justice department 
it also dampened prospects for confirmation if the lucas 
candidacy reaches the senate floor perhaps after lawmakers return 
from their august recess 
thus far republicans are scoffing at any talk of withdrawing the 
nomination and civil rights forces are preparing for a fullscale 
showdown in the senate judiciary committee perhaps as early as 
thursday 
this is the most important civil rights vote that senators 
will have this year said william taylor of the citizens 
commission on civil rights 
president bush would suffer a painful embarrassment if the 
senate rejected lucas a black and former democrat who in 1986 
switched parties to run an unsuccessful race for governor of 
michigan as a republican 
republicans expect to move the nomination out of the judiciary 
committee where it has been marooned for months republicans 
outnumbered 86 on the committee may need to capture two of 
perhaps three wavering votes if they are to win a favorable 
recommendation from the panel for lucas 
if the committee balks at giving a favorable recommendation 
there are other routes to the senate floor but the nomination 
would arrive there under a cloud and lucas critics say they have 
stronger backing on the floor than in the committee 
the nomination is in trouble says ralph neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
we have a week to work said patrick mcguigan of the 
conservative free congress foundation as lucas supporters sought to 
bring pressure on senators believed to be wavering by most counts 
they were sens dennis deconcini dariz howell heflin dala 
and arlen specter rpa 
he needs to get two of them and if he loses two then he is 
still in trouble said sen paul simon dill simon said that 
after the confirmation hearing he was inclined to oppose the 
nominee because of lukewarm testimony on civil rights issues 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel expressed the 
same sentiments saying he was disappointed that lucas had not 
demonstrated more enthusiasm for the civil rights cause 
deconcini said lucas could have helped his own cause if he had 
couched it a little better when he backed the bush 
administrations position that there is no reason to be upset over 
recent court rulings on job discrimination minority set asides and 
other civil rights concerns 
but he said it was unreasonable to expect the nominee to attack 
the president and his prospective boss attorney general dick 
thornburgh deconcini did stop just short of expressing full 
support 
when i started out these hearings i was in favor of lucas and 
i am still but im going to review the record in full before i 
make an absolute decision deconcini said in an interview friday 
heflin sent word through an aide that he remained undecided 
civil rights groups complained that lucas had never taken part 
in a trial filed a brief or handled an appeal its like me 
having a medical degree but never practicing medicine and being 
named to head a team of brain surgeons said elaine jones of the 
naacp legal defense and educational fund 
lucas supporters scoff at such complaints and predict they will 
prevail on the judiciary panel i think there are enough 
democrats who realize this is a very fine man who has a good 
reputation who has done a good job in every job he has held and who 
deserves this responsibility said sen orrin hatch rutah 
but justice department lobbyists rushed to conyers office with 
lucas in tow thursday morning after the black lawmaker threatened 
to withdraw his support unless the nominee were willing to recant 
his wednesday testimony 
conyers had been drafted to stand in for michigans two 
senators democrats don riegle and carl levin after they refused 
the customary courtesy of introducing lucas to the judiciary 
committee they said such an action might be mistaken for an 
endorsement

george bush lamented in his inaugural address 
last january that the united states had more will than wallet 
a fact that was clearly evident at the presidents first economic 
summit 
bush went to the annual gathering of the worlds seven largest 
industrial democracies last week with a bag full of ideas on 
reducing third world debt promoting democracy in poland and 
hungary and cleaning up global pollution 
but he carried little in hard cash to back up the initiatives 
he proposed no new money for the pollution cleanup conceded that 
the united states was dependent on others to back his third world 
debt plan and offered what some thought was an embarrassingly small 
125 million package of assistance to hungary and poland 
despite the slim wallet however bush managed to a significant 
degree to control the agenda of the meeting with the leaders of 
france britain japan west germany italy and canada 
that was quite a feat for a nation that is now the worlds 
largest debtor country a nation that must depend on 10 billion in 
investment from the rest of the world each month to finance its 
huge budget and trade deficits 
the final communique issued at the end of the threeday 
gathering mirrored to a great extent the goals that the 
administration had set coming into the meeting 
on third world debt the seven summit nations gave their 
blessing to the debt forgiveness plan first unveiled on march 10 by 
treasury secretary nicholas brady japan even announced that it was 
putting up more money to support the proposal boosting its 
financial backing to 55 billion the administration was 
disappointed that negotiations between mexico and its creditor 
banks taking place in new york were not completed by the time the 
summit ended but officials say they believe those talks soon will 
provide the first success story for the brady initiative 
on global pollution the summit as bush had hoped made the 
environment a top priority for the first time since these 
gatherings began 15 years ago the final communique called for an 
acceleration in preparations for an international convention 
designed to draw up guidelines for dealing with the threat of 
global warming and also addressed such issues as depletion of the 
ozone layer ocean pollution and loss of forest land 
on eastwest relations bush scored his biggest triumph he 
managed to seize the initiative in this area through his 
historymaking trip to poland and hungary immediately before the 
start of the summit the other summit countries many of whom had 
earlier announced their own efforts to foster economic reforms in 
communist eastern europe endorsed us proposals to advance these 
efforts the final communique however did not contain any 
specifics on how much money the nations would be willing to put up 
despite its success in paris the administration is facing 
questions about americas current financial predicament and what it 
means for the countrys longrun position on the world stage 
because of the tight fiscal constraints we are not in a 
position to put a lot of resources to deal with global economic 
problems rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the joint 
economic committee of congress said during a review of the paris 
summit 
it seems to me the baton is passing to other nations better 
able to provide financing than we are hamilton told brady 
brady conceded that the inability of the united states to put up 
resources to back its global initiatives was a serious worry 
but he said the paris summit demonstrated that the western leaders 
had the will to work together to solve common problems 
some observors however believe the paris summit may mark the 
beginning of a transition to a new world order in which the united 
states is now first among equals with the other summit countries 
c fred bergsten director of the institute for international 
economics a washington thinktank gave bush high marks for being 
able to push us initiatives in paris while at the same time 
urging other countries to foot the bill 
bergsten said the key test will come in whether the united 
states is willing to share decisionmaking on international issues 
as it seeks funding help from other countries 
the paris summit could mark the first early step away from a 
usled world to a world where the united states puts up the 
ideas and looks to others to put up the money he said

a 1987 state constitutional amendment 
broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons 
may own guns a judge ruled 
cumberland county superior court justice stephen l perkins on 
friday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felon 
against edward brown of cumberland 
prosecutors had argued that the amendments backers did not 
intend to allow felons to own guns but the judge said nothing in 
the amendment indicated such an intent 
if maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or 
qualify the right to keep and bear arms they could have enacted a 
constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions 
perkins wrote 
maines right to keep and bear arms amendment is the most 
broad and least restrictive of any of the 43 similar state 
amendments he wrote 
attorney general james e tierney said saturday that the case 
would be appealed adding with all due respect to justice 
perkins we think he is wrong 
the maine constitution used to guaranteed the right to keep and 
bear arms for the common defense 
in 1986 the maine supreme court upheld a gun violation by 
focusing on the common defense phrase in response the 
legislature enacted a constitutional amendment deleting that 
language and voters approved it in november 1987 
the amendment declared every citizen has a right to keep and 
bear armsand this right shall never be questioned 
brown had been accused of criminal threatening in 1988 as well 
as with illegal possession of a gun he previously had been 
convicted under the states habitual offender law for operating a 
motor vehicle after his drivers license had been revoked 
perkins denied a motion to dismiss the criminal threatening 
charge but threw out the gun possession charge saying there is 
simply no rational connection between browns previous conviction 
and his ownership of a firearm

the leader of the governing 
national party said saturday the african national congress should 
follow the lead of nelson mandela by committing itself to a 
peaceful settlement in south africa 
fw de klerk expected to succeed pw botha as president after 
elections in september told a party congress he had supported the 
planning of the meeting this month between botha and mandela the 
anc leader who has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life 
term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
the meeting at bothas residence in cape town was in the 
best interest of south africa de klerk said he made no direct 
reference to the possibility of mandelas release but implied that 
the anc leader was now considered by the government to be a 
potential voice of reconciliation 
few details of the surprise mandelabotha meeting have been 
disclosed beyond a statement from justice minister kobie coetsee 
who was present and said both leaders confirmed their support for 
peaceful development in south africa 
mandela later issued his own statement confirming the accuracy 
of coetsees comment but emphasizing that no peaceful solution 
could be found unless the government negotiated with the anc and 
its allied groups in south africa 
the anc the largest guerrilla group fighting the government is 
illegal in south africa 
de klerk in his speech to 500 national party delegates from 
cape province appeared to be trying to drive a wedge between 
mandela and the anc which has waged a bombing and sabotage 
campaign in south africa since 1961 
as a result of its relationship with mr mandela the anc 
cannot escape addressing the issue at stake is it prepared to 
follow the lead given by him and to commit itself to the pursuit of 
peaceful solutions de klerk asked 
the ball is now squarely in the ancs court and not as some 
would have it in the governments 
if the anc wants to engage in dialogue it should abandon 
violence and terrorism said de klerk adding we are not 
afraid to talk to people who differ from us 
the national party wants to talk to recognized leaders of 
all factions de klerk said scientific surveys prove beyond 
doubt that the support of the anc is absolutely overrated in many 
quarters 
de klerk reiterated his vision of a new south africa in 
which the disenfranchised black majority would have a formal voice 
in national politics but would not be able to impose its will on 
the white minority 
earlier in the day botha and his wife elize made an 
appearance at the congress the outgoing president received several 
standing ovations and was honored by a motion praising him as one 
of south africas greatest sons 
i am a happy man because i live in a country of hope a 
country of the future said botha 73 all i ask is when we 
make the choices when we build the future lets hold each other 
together with loyalty

judith lurie her husband and two children had 
finally received permission to leave the soviet union emmanuel 
lurie quit his job the children were taken out of school the 
airplane tickets were purchased 
five days before their scheduled departure the exit visas were 
revoked the family was told the permits would be reissued soon 
that was 10 years ago and the luries are still waiting 
soviet authorities say emmanuel lurie cannot leave because he 
knows secrets from the twoyear period he worked as a young organic 
chemistry researcher in a government facility 27 years ago 
he had access to classified information but he had just 
graduated from university and had a junior job and science has 
changed so much since then what damage can he do asked judith 
lurie who used a tourist visa to travel to the halls of the state 
department and congress to plead her husbands case this past week 
the luries are at the top of the state departments list of 
soviet citizens denied permission to emigrate because of their 
alleged knowledge of state secrets but in the public eye their 
plight has been all but obscured by the unprecedented flood of 
jews pentacostalists and armenians flowing out of mikhail 
gorbachevs soviet union with its liberalized political and 
economic policies 
the world is enchanted by words like glasnost and 
perestroika but people like us continue to live with the horror 
and we feel abandoned said mrs lurie 
in an unusual gesture motivated perhaps by persistent lobbying 
on her familys behalf in the united states israel and europe 
mrs lurie and her 13yearold daughter were granted twomonth 
tourist visas so they could travel to visit her ailing mother and 
married daughter in israel 
she is one of 10000 soviets allowed out as tourists last year 
but only one of a handful of refuseniks among them refusenik 
is the term coined by human rights activists in the 1970s to denote 
a person who has been repeatedly refused permission to emigrate by 
soviet authorities 
mrs lurie said she resigned her job as a high school english 
teacher last year after the principal made life intolerable 
because of her dissident activities she was a founder of a group 
called jewish women against refusal and took part last year in a 
hunger strike to press the refusenik communitys case 
the national council of soviet jewry a usbased group 
estimates there are 2500 refuseniks of the 22151 soviets allowed 
to leave so far this year all but a few were firsttime 
applicants according to the group 
the luries first applied to leave in 1979 emmanuel lurie 
having quit his first job in 1964 was working for the soviet 
academy of science in an unclassified position for 11 months the 
authorities considered the familys visa application and then 
granted the exit permits 
mrs lurie said she does not know why they then changed their 
minds 
whenever i ask them why they say well you know better than 
we do she recounted 
in the meantime her mother was allowed to leave as was her 
married daughter they moved to israel and mrs lurie saw her 
mother this month for the first time in nine years 
the supreme soviet or parliament has been rewriting the 
countrys emigration laws to streamline and liberalize them one 
provision under consideration would revise the state secrets 
clause making five years the amount of time that must elapse 
before an applicant can become eligible to leave the country 
the bush administration has promised that once the new law is 
completed and implemented it will consider lifting some trade 
restrictions against the soviets 
but for mrs lurie who must return to moscow no later than 
september it may be too late she has been told the provisions 
might apply only to new applicants not retroactively to people 
such as her husband 
many changes have happened in the soviet union but there are 
still prisoners of conscience still people in gulags still 
refuseniks like us she said 
and meanwhile our lives pass times passes and nothing 
changes

the state department has invited canadian 
diplomats to a meeting here next week to resolve increasingly tense 
boundary disputes between american fishermen and armed canadian 
marine patrols 
rep gerry e studds dmass a senior member of the house 
merchant marine and fisheries committee who pushed for the 
negotiations said he fears the disputes with each side accusing 
the other of border cheating will end in tragedy 
if this keeps up someone is going to get killed said 
studds a critic of the canadians aggressive gunpointing pursuits 
of american fishing vessels spotted on the canadian side of georges 
bank off the northeast coast 
clearly we have had some us fishermen who have stretched 
their luck probably knowingly the congressman said in a recent 
interview we do not condone that but even in those cases we 
dont believe there is an excuse for armed force the way the 
canadians are doing 
edward e wolfe deputy assistant secretary of state for oceans 
and fisheries affairs agrees that the current situation risks 
more serious incidents and possibly loss of life 
several days after meeting with studds wolfe invited officials 
at the canadian department of fisheries and oceans to a series of 
meetings on the growing border tensions the meetings are scheduled 
for july 31 aug 1 and aug 2 
wolfe in an interview last week said the bilateral meetings 
would cover the whole range of legal navigational and law 
enforcement issues 
while the canadians are expected to accept the invitation to 
what wolfe described as an urgent meeting differences over the 
border patrols remain deep 
theres always room to maintain an open dialogue on ways in 
which the patrols might be handled but thats not to say there 
is anything wrong at the present said a canadian embassy 
official who has followed the dispute 
studds whose cape cod and southeastern massachusetts district 
relies heavily on commercial fishing believes many of the border 
crossings by us vessels are honest mistakes 
jeff pike an aide to the congressman said five of the six 
navigational charts issued to american fishermen by the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration contain uscanadian border 
errors of up to four miles 
that along with differences in readings from navigational 
equipment in the two countries can account for many of the border 
crossings studds said 
the canadian government however maintains that the us 
fishermen are knowingly entering canadian waters to get an edge in 
competitive fishing markets 
we certainly believe theyre crossing the border 
deliberately said hugh trudeau director of atlantic operations 
for the canadian department of fisheries and oceans 
the disputes stem from an international court of justice 
decision in 1984 establishing a border to separate the two 
countries marine zones before the border was established a 
disputed zone existed where fishermen from both countries 
fished side by side 
canadas tough marine enforcement was highlighted last year when 
canadian patrols fired at the donna lynn a new bedford mass 
scalloper after the vessels captain refused to let officials on 
board the captain claimed his boat was in us waters 
recently another new bedford boat was pursued by canadian 
patrols for 14 hours

the signs of dangerous cults are everywhere 
including the nations colleges a cult expert told campus police 
officials 
you may not think its a problem on your campus but you have 
it marcia r rudin director of the international cult education 
program said at a friday meeting of the international association 
of campus law enforcement administrators 
were concerned about religious cults ms rudin said 
its been 10 years since jonestown people ask us havent they 
gone away unfortunately not 
cults from mindcontrolling unconventional christian 
organizations to violenceprone satanic groups are still very 
much around on college campuses she said 
about 30 police officials from campuses around the country heard 
from ms rudin on the nature of cult activity and the warning signs 
of satanism while none of the police officials said he or she had 
experienced criminal problems with cults several sought more 
information 
weve had no indication of any involvement by our college 
students said bill byars director of campus safety at berry 
college a school of 1800 near rome ga 
but we try to stay in tune with it he said there are 
general signs you pick up or pay attention to we realize it 
could happen 
a cult ms rudin said is a group exhibiting excessive 
devotion to an idea and using unethically manipulative 
techniques of persuasion and control she said what makes cults 
dangerous and sometimes violenceprone is the attitude that the 
end justifies the means 
some fringe christian groups she said couple their city names 
with the designation church of christ not to be confused with 
the mainstream churches of christ ms rudin said those fringe 
groups can be very dangerous subjecting converts to a numbing 
shepherding discipleship 
some of these new groups dont look like cults she said 
theyve tried to look more like mainstream churches to confuse 
people 
cults are not necessarily criminal she said noting its not 
against any law for a young person to give up a collegiate career 
to proselytize for christ or even to worship satan or wear occult 
paraphernalia 
but she said some cults including satanic ones have turned 
to weapons and violence 
ms rudin urged campus police to watch for satanic trappings 
symbols literature daggers and sometimes heavy metal rock music 
as possible clues to the existence of ritualistic violence 
but she said those things are likely harmless unless you see 
a lot of these things together just because you dress in black 
doesnt mean anything 
the real problem is deciding when youve got a problem she 
said

the pilot of a philippine airlines 
plane that crashed on a highway killing eight people did not 
acknowledge instructions from air traffic controllers not to land 
during a heavy downpour airport officials said saturday 
an official also said the runway lights were out at the time of 
fridays crash despite an order to turn them on because of the 
storm 
the twinengine bac 111 jet with 98 people aboard missed a 
runway crashed through a concrete wall and bounced onto manilas 
south expressway killing eight people on the ground and injuring 
91 people one person was in critical condition saturday 
the plane smashed at least four vehicles when it bounced off the 
12lane highway and careened onto railroad tracks next to the 
highway witnesses said 
it was traveling to the capital from zamboanga city 540 miles 
southeast of manila 
visibility was limited because of heavy rain officials said 
however no official cause of the crash has been given 
when the plane was over the runway the pilot was given 
instructions to pull up based on the analysis of the controller 
that he was not going to make it rudy flores the control tower 
supervisor told the associated press he did not say exactly how 
high the plane was at the time 
the pilot did not acknowledge and instead of pulling up he 
continued to descend flores said 
airline spokesman enrique santos refused to comment on flores 
statement saying an investigation was under way santos said 
earlier friday that the pilot capt ricardo misa had been cleared 
for landing when the runway is in sight 
misa himself was not available for comment 
rose reyes flores deputy confirmed that the plane had 
initially been cleared to land when the aircraft last radioed the 
tower from five miles away she said however that the rainstorm 
got worse after that 
flores said the instructions to the pilot were changed when 
controllers judged he could not safely land 
the runway lights also were out during the midafternoon crash 
despite the storm ms reyes said 
at least 20 minutes before the crash after skies darkened and 
rain started falling in sheets tower controllers told airport 
electricians to turn on the lights to help guide the plane she 
said 
they told us the lights were on thats its ok but when we 
saw that there were no runway lights we called them again ms 
reyes said there may have been something wrong with the lights 
maybe the cables we dont know 
airline officials have turned over the planes flight and voice 
recorders to a fiveman investigation team from the air 
transportation office

investigators are trying to find out why an 
airliner designed to fly without one of its engines couldnt and 
why an engine designed to contain its own failure apparently didnt 
government engineers and scientists poring over the wreckage and 
records of flight 232 have not yet found the cause of the united 
airlines dc10 crash wednesday that killed more than a third of the 
296 people aboard 
what they knew by the weekend was that an explosive engine 
failure occurred while the threeengine airliner was en route from 
denver to chicago that portions of the tail section were damaged 
in the explosion and that the hydraulic flight control systems had 
lost all its fluid by the time the plane crashlanded at the sioux 
city airport 
the national transportation safety board was focusing in the 
first days of what will be a monthslong investigation on the 
15yearold airliners enginecarrying tail section the disabled 
hydraulic systems the planes maintenance records and the actions 
of its cockpit crew 
in the long run they also will examine issues related to 
aircraft design crew training passenger survival after impact 
performance of the air traffic control system and federal oversight 
of maintenance along with emergency preparations and performance 
on the ground 
jim burnett the safety board member supervising the 
investigation said the engine explosion conceivably could have 
caused the failure of three independent hydraulic systems which 
come closest together in the planes tail but investigators were 
still searching for parts of the engine some material from the 
tail area was found up to 60 miles from the crash site 
if the engine explosion damaged the hydraulics the key 
unanswered question remains what caused the jet engine to explode 
among possibilities being considered 
a maintenance problem repair work was done in the area of the 
engine a day before the flight 
material from the engine itself or from another part of the 
plane might have flown into the interior aviation experts say 
birds have also disabled engines in the past although engines 
must pass a test in which a chicken is thrown into the intake 
federal regulations require that engines be built to withstand 
any probable occurrence but they need not be designed to survive a 
scenario that has less than a oneinabillion chance of occurring 
they also are supposed to be designed so an uncontained engine 
failure will blow material out through the rear and away from the 
plane the engine housing is supposed to be strong enough to 
prevent dislodged engine parts such as a fan blade from blowing 
into the passenger section or other parts of the plane 
but aircraft are built to be as light as possible and an 
explosive failure could have the force of a powerful bomb in which 
case no housing would be strong enough to contain it 
airliners also must be able not only to fly but to climb with 
one engine out single engine failures in flight are not unusual 
and if no other damage is done to the plane a pilot usually has 
the option of completing his flight 
flight 232 pilot al c haynes told investigators that the only 
means he had of controlling flight was to use engine thrust 
applying power to both engines would make the plane go up 
decreasing power would cause it to descend 
applying small amounts of power to one wing engine could turn 
the plane haynes told ground control he could only turn to the 
right indicating control surfaces such as the rudder might have 
been stuck in a position that prevented left turns said federal 
aviation administration spokesman fred farrar 
haynes had an offduty pilot on his knees manipulating the 
throttle according to burnett 
aviation experts describe the feat as remarkable something 
pilots arent even trained to do although the plane tumbled and 
exploded in the landing haynes managed to get it down in such a 
way that most passengers and crew survived 
the general electric cf66d engines used exclusively on dc10s 
since both the planes and engines went into service in the early 
1970s pass all faa requirements 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said friday there was no 
need to ground dc10s as occurred after the 1979 crash of an 
american airlines dc10 in chicago that killed 273 people the 
plane was allowed to fly again after 37 days and the crash was 
blamed on an improper maintenance procedure 
asked whether people should avoid flying on dc10s skinner 
said no not at this point

in the glow of celebrating the apollo 11 
anniversary with the men who landed on the lunar surface president 
bush proposed a commitment to go back to the moon this time 
back to stay 
the trip he laid out for the nation would be stepbystep a 
space station first then the moon and eventually mars each 
mission should and will lay the groundwork for the next the 
president said 
thats akin to laying the groundwork for a driving trip across 
country by wheeling around the block for a few years and then 
gaining experience in the next suburb for a few years more 
predictably advocates of exploring with satellites and probes 
which dont need expensive creature comforts were aghast but 
manned space flight supporters rushed to praise the bush outline 
delivered thursday on the 20th anniversary of the first moon 
landing 
space station yes mars yes but why go to the moon 
in my view there is no good reason said carl sagan the 
cornell astronomer who has led the scientific communitys fight for 
sending humans to mars the moon is not much like mars its not 
any closer to mars in the idea of a way station or stepping stone 
scientifically it is very different mars has an atmosphere 
polar caps evidence of past running water it has the possibility 
of ancient life the moon has none of that the moon is static 
airless pretty dull 
lewis friedman executive director of the planetary society 
said the case for a moon base has not yet been made the idea of 
permanently occupying the moon is one that is not justified 
we havent permanently occupied the oceans the notion that we 
are going back to the moon to stay and all that implies is not 
yet well founded 
rep bill nelson dfla chairman of the house space 
subcommittee said he would prefer to send astronauts straight to 
mars unless there is extraordinary scientific value for that 
being a first step theres been no such evidence he said and 
common sense would say it will delay us in time and it will cost 
us more if we go back to the moon 
the new york times in an editorial called a return to the moon 
a failure of imagination and fresh thought and pointed out that 
nasa already has a ton of moon rocks 
the president offered neither timetable nor money in his 
expansive vision for a journey into tomorrow whose bills will 
come due long after he has moved out of the white house what he 
offered is american leadership 
why the moon why mars because it is humanitys destiny to 
strive to seek to find and because it is americas destiny to 
lead he said 
the budding controversy is joined by those who like rep bill 
green rny think only machines belong in space not humans 
currently congress is split between science and gomango 
he said i see no scientific justification for putting a colony 
on the moon and no scientific justification for visiting mars 
and he added one cost of sending men to the moon first is to 
get to mars later if youre going to mars directly you are 
looking at the year 2009 but if you are going to do it via the 
moon you are looking at the second decade in the 21st century 
none of this comes as any surprise to frank martin who heads 
the exploration office of the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
im sure we are going to have a nice debate over this in the 
next six months he said as you can imagine we put a lot of 
thought into this recognizing in the long term that mars is 
sexier its the long range view we need to be taking 
nobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the apollo program of the 
1960s when getting to the moon and returning home was the only 
goal to beat the soviets 
the moon is attractive as an outpost martin said because 
its possible to have significant achievements in 10 years when 
you start asking people to work and asking the nation to focus on 
something its got to be something where the milestone is 
achievable in some finite period 
other good reasons said martin are 
we know a great deal about the moon we have a good data 
base of understanding of whats there and how to work with that 
its nearby its three days away when you commit people to 
mars you are talking six months to a year just to get there 
mars is one third of the gravitational field of the earth 
the moon is one sixth earth gravity if they do well in the one 
sixth gravitational environment we know they will do well in 
onethird g 
in addition he said the technical and engineering experiences 
on the surface of the moon can be used to develop the systems to be 
used on mars 
in sagans view thats not a good argument for a moon stop 
i understand the institutional reasons for wanting an 
intermediate goal he said but what worries me is that the 
milestone may supplant the objective that the moon may be a dead 
end it might gobble up all the fiscal intellectual and practical 
resources there is no test for mars exploration we cant do more 
cheaply or safely in earth orbit or on the earth itself 
sagan and friedman praised the bush speech 
it is after all the first commitment by an american 
president to send humans to mars said sagan if it contained 
absolutely nothing else im for it 
friedman said bush should be commended for finally being a 
president who stepped up to say space has a national purpose to 
serve the country 
both scientists said they wished bush had proposed the mars 
journey as an international venture with the soviets who have said 
they wanted to do it that way 
missions of this scale cannot be justified to satisfy the 
curiosity of scientists to provide some vicarious sense of 
exploration by the american people sagan said its too much 
money just as apollo needed a major political justification the 
competition with the russians so this needs a major political 
justification it cant be just competition it has to be 
cooperation

miners in the countrys biggest coal field on 
saturday rejected a government offer to end their weeklong strike 
and reports indicated half the coal industrys 1 million workers 
remained off the job 
all mines have stopped the tass news agency reported from 
the donetsk coal basin in the ukraine 
miners in one major coal center karaganda in the republic of 
kazakhstan began returning to work after negotiators worked out a 
settlement package tass said but other strikes were depriving 
vital factories of fuel and threatening industry nationwide 
the donetsk basin has 121 pits with an annual production of 210 
million metric tons 
miners many in helmets and overalls gathered outside 
government offices in the city of donetsk and rejected the pact 
which would have increased vacation time and paid workers for time 
spent descending into pits 
western reporters said about 5000 miners assembled to vote down 
the deal strike leaders told a rally they would continue the 
walkout because they didnt have faith the government would 
implement the agreement 
the strikers insist on the immediate satisfaction of their 
conditions for retirement benefits for miners which is not within 
the competence of local authorities and also that the government 
guarantee fulfillment of their demands tass said 
after learning miners had not accepted the proposals president 
mikhail s gorbachev and prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov sent a 
telegram urging them to return to work because the situation in 
several economic sectors has reached critical levels 
the kremlin leaders assured strikers their demands would be 
reviewed urgently by the supreme soviet parliament and the 
council of ministers with participation by representatives of the 
miners to reach the necessary decisions tass reported 
about 300000 donetsk miners have been striking since july 15 
holding out for more concessions than those granted siberian miners 
who began the wave of labor unrest july 11 
the siberian miners from the kuznetsk coal basin the nations 
secondlargest coal field returned to work thursday and friday 
after they were promised pay increases more consumer goods and 
greater control over their industry 
officials have said the kuznetsk settlement would apply to 
miners nationwide but the remaining strikers were holding out for 
more concessions 
alexander e makarsky a tv journalist in donetsk said in a 
telephone interview a proposed settlement was reached saturday 
after two days of negotiations between miners representatives the 
government and the official trade union he said it included 
earlier pension eligibility pay increases and extended vacations 
to 42 days with even more time offered to miners working in 
especially difficult or dangerous conditions 
miners currently get 27 vacation days viktor i alexyanko a 
strike leader in makeyevka in the donetsk basin said in a 
telephone interview 
the kuznetsk agreement also extended vacations to 42 days but 
the labor daily trud quoted donetsk strike leader v koval as 
saying donetsk miners want more vacation because their work 
conditions are worse 
koval said donetesk pits are two or three times deeper than 
those in other regions and that temperatures in them sometimes go 
above 104 
makarsky said another provision in the agreement would have 
given miners pay for the time it takes them to descend into the 
pits sometimes up to two hours 
in karaganda negotiators reviewed 45 demands and signed an 
agreement saturday to end a twoday strike tass said all miners 
in the city went back to work and those in outlying areas at 26 
mines were following news agency reported 
among the demands of karaganda miners were that nuclear weapons 
tests be stopped at the semipalatinsk range in kazakhstan and that 
destruction of mediumrange nuclear weapons be stopped elsewhere in 
the republic according to trud the miners contend those 
activities are harming the environment 
there was no immediate word whether the government agreed to the 
nuclearrelated demands 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said miners remained on strike 
at 11 of the 13 mines in vorkuta in the pechora basin in the arctic 
and at all 12 mines in chervonograd in the western ukraine anatoly 
dotsenko a spokesman for the ukrainian helsinki watch group in 
moscow said the strike also spread to four of the eight mines of 
novovolynsk in the western ukraine on the polish border but that 
miners there returned to work after a government representative 
said authorities would meet their demands 
the economic toll and threat to the coke and steel industries 
was a major theme of saturdays press reports 
sovietskaya rossiya said the steel industry was in a critical 
state because it lacked coal a karaganda steel plant director 
warned he had only a days worth of coal reserves and steelworkers 
in pavlograd in the donetsk basin said they had only a twoday 
supply newspapers reported 
pravda said a boiler station and asphalt plant in pavlograd have 
shut down because of the fuel shortage 
trud said there was a threat of caveins and floods of water at 
striking mines apparently because maintenance crews were striking

a group has launched a petition drive to 
recall the school board president in this san francisco suburb 
accusing him of defrauding voters by not disclosing he is gay until 
after he had been in office for four years 
the fremont family alliance filed recall papers last week 
against board president robert stipicevich the group has five 
months to gather 12000 signatures for a recall measure to be put 
on the ballot 
stipicevich who was one of the youngest elected officials in 
california when he won a school board seat four years ago at age 
22 says he disclosed his homosexuality at a news conference in may 
because was tired of constant whispering behind his back 
i think its real important to say that i am not living a 
lie he said there isnt an office in the land or a position 
in the country thats worth it 
he called fremont a san francisco suburb with a population of 
more than 130000 a diverse community and theyre not going to 
be bothered by this its irrelevant to the job im doing on the 
school board 
in addition to defrauding voters the family alliance says his 
homosexuality created a conflict of interest arguing that he 
should have abstained from voting on the school districts recently 
enacted aids education curriculum 
were bombarded by the media emphasizing that its ok to be so 
liberal and that since the largest city in the area accepts it it 
must be so said ron smith a spokesman for the group 
we dont want outside forces dictating how fremont should be 
run and the type of politics that should be here he added the 
alliance includes some ministers but no church organization has 
officially backed it 
the petition drive has prompted soulsearching in this town 
which was named 33 years ago for a pioneer explorer because its 
citizens considered themselves a progressive community 
his foes say community identity is at stake many feel the idea 
that gay people should be open about their lifestyles in this 
politically moderate enclave is an attempt to import gay 
politics from san francisco 35 miles northeast 
fremont isnt the only city in the region concerned about gay 
rights issues an antiaids discrimination measure faces a 
referendum in nearby concord where similar charges of outside 
influence have been made 
and in san francisco itself a proposal to overturn the citys 
domesticpartnership law has been placed on the ballot after church 
groups circulated referendum petitions the law gives homosexual 
couples some benefits available to married couples 
i hope its a trend said smith youre finding a backlash 
because people have just sat still and finally something had to 
happen 
he said that even though stipicevichs term expires next year 
the group is seeking a recall vote to bring the issue before the 
public 
stipicevich a shipping and mail supervisor for a clothing 
chain recently received glowing endorsements from other school 
board members at the first board meeting after his announcement 
75 supporters showed up and gave him a standing ovation and he 
says he has received hundreds of letters of support from across the 
country 
but stipicevich also has received a death threat a few obscene 
letters and the recall drive former city councilman ken steadman 
told stipicevich at one board meeting he was exploiting children 
because of his moral corruptions 
state assemblywoman delaine eastin calls the issue needlessly 
divisive 
bob did what he felt he had to do she said i cant make 
that decision for him 
the question on balance is if bob is making good policy 
decisions not whether he should have come out of the closet

moslem guerrillas fired eight rockets 
into the capital saturday killing at least 43 people and wounding 
more than 100 in the deadliest attack on the city in 11 years of 
civil war government and hospital officials said 
the most obvious reaction on the part of the government would 
be to retaliate said foreign ministry spokesman mohammed nabi 
amani 
staterun radio kabul monitored in islamabad pakistan said 40 
people were killed in the attack and 137 injured amani who called 
it the worst attack on the capital said at least 40 people were 
killed and 114 wounded 
hospital sources speaking on condition of anonymity said later 
that at least three people had died of their wounds 
many of the injured are in a very critical condition said 
one doctor as nurses tore strips of cloth into bandages there 
is no way we can save them 
at least 20 people died when a rocket landed at a bus station 
near the city center amani said the terminal was crowded with 
people when the rocket hit at 10 am witnesses said 
i was selling cigarettes when suddenly i heard a loud bang and 
people around me started screaming said mohammad abdullah a 
16yearold vendor as he spoke from his hospital bed that is 
the last thing i remember 
pakistanibased guerrilla forces had no immediate comment on 
saturdays attack 
the usbacked guerrillas have in the past denied 
responsibility for attacks on civilian areas they have said the 
government shells its own capital to throw the blame on them 
guerrillas have said however that rockets meant for military 
targets sometimes go astray 
rebels and troops of the marxist government have continued to 
battle for control of the country despite the withdrawal of the 
final soviet troops last february the soviets sent forces to

and christian forces 
police said six people were killed and 52 wounded overnight 
shellfire severed power cables and plunged the city which 
usually gets one to two hours of power a day into darkness the 
only lights that illuminated the skies were the flashes of 
exploding shells 
ambulances drove on sidewalks hugging the walls of highrise 
apartment buildings for cover through loudspeakers they shouted 
a civil defense team is in the area please notify us if you need 
any help 
over here over here a mans voice echoed in the densely 
populated west beirut neighborhood of zaidaniyeh the rescuers

trapped under a demolished house 
in the district of koreitem artillery rounds blasted a building 
while inhabitants were in the underground shelter

find her apartment a pile of rubble unable to cope with the shock 
mrs medawar 68 suffered a heart attack and died instantly 
the casualties from the shelling raised the toll to 440 killed 
and 1836 wounded in the 18week confrontation between mainly 
christian troops under gen michel aoun who heads a christian 
government and the syrians who back a rival moslem government 
several casualties remained under the rubble for quite a long 
time simply because no one had a telephone line to request help 
from rescuers a police spokesman said insisting on anonymity in 
line with standing regulations 
the divided capital shook as syrian gunners entrenched in west 
beirut operated their sovietdesigned 122mm bm21 multibarreled 
rocket launchers that fire 40 projectiles a minute 
the rockets blasted residential districts in christian east 
beirut the coastline to the north and hills to the east and 
northeast 
aouns troops opened up with 155mm howitzers and 130mm mortars 
targeting mainly syrian military positions but many rounds 
ricocheted to nearby areas

broke out two days after aoun clamped a blockade of ports run by 
syrianbacked militias south of beirut in an effort to recoup 100 
million annually in lost customs dues

in the era of aids and soaring teenage pregnancy 
rates age 4 is not too young to start talking about sexual 
matters say the developers of a new howto sex education kit 
aimed at the younger set 
the 995 talk listen care kit complete with coloring book 
handbooks and card game is headed for bookstore shelves to help 
stir that discussion it was developed by harvard community health 
plan foundation in response to high rates of us teenage 
pregnancy 
solid communication has to be established with kids before 
their teenage time said dr susan pauker executive director of 
the foundation if you have open communication early on then all 
kinds of other questions come out as well and so when they hit 
their years of sexuality and turbulent hormonal distress then 
they have a place to go she said 
the kit offers such discussion tools as a family handbook for 
children between 4 and 8 a book to help prepare parents to talk to 
preteens about sex a coloring book and a card game for ages 9 and 
up 
in the game players read a scenario from cards they draw and 
offer an opinion 
subjects range from the general drinking messy rooms divorce 
to the more sensitive 
my friend jennifer is pregnant reads one she has always 
said abortion was wrong but now shes not sure she is scared that 
shes wrecked her life what do you think 
another situation poses the question of whether felicia and tom 
who are thinking of going all the way should get birth 
control just in case 
the cards offer questions but answers are strictly up to the 
players 
its not a teachers values nor a pediatricians values but 
rather the parents own values pauker said 
some of the cards deal with sexual issues such as 
contraception aids and abortion but many deal with problems such 
as fights over staying out late how much tv is too much the fear 
of being kidnapped and what to do about suspected child abuse 
the kit also has a quiz for parents that point up common foibles 
such as being too embarrassed to name body parts doling out stingy 
amounts of information or waiting for the child to broach the 
question of sex 
tips to parents include practicing saying awkward words in front 
of a mirror 
the techniques help blunt the awkwardness of talking about sex 
a topic that parents cant afford to ignore pauker said 
three thousand adolescents unintentionally become pregnant each 
day or 11 million per year according to the alan guttmacher 
institute in new york coupled with those figures are studies 
showing that 80 percent of all parents dont talk about sex to 
their children 
that means children are getting their information elsewhere 
mostly from television shows that often dont present a realistic 
view of sex or its consequences pauker said 
i think what happens in middle school with a lot of kids is 
they decide they know it all she said all of the myths like 
you never can get pregnant your first time need to be dispelled 
before they get started 
starting young doesnt necessarily mean delivering all the facts 
of life to a toddler the educational materials advise stopping 
once a childs attention wanders and keeping answers short and 
simple 
even verbal little tiny kids are capable of asking very 
important questions pauker said its also important for 
parents you have to get together on how youre going to speak in 
this regard you dont want one side giving the stork story and one 
side giving technical information 
development of the kit showed that parents biggest fears of 
open communication was that the kids would consider it a license 
to get pregnant or a license to behave sexually pauker said 
but then they began to realize that the opposite occurs that 
once there was knowledge that there wouldnt be this curiosity 
children too were apprehensive about discussing sex she said 
in the beginning they start to be really embarrassed she 
said the game and coloring book approach of the kit helped 
children get over the awkwardness she said

cars and trucks stalled by an accident a mile ahead on the 
pennsylvania turnpike killing five people in the fiery pileup 
saturday 
the truck driver and a family of four were killed while some 
other drivers apparently were spared because they had stepped out 
of their cars and were standing alongside the road police said 
the northbound lanes of the turnpikes northeast extension were 
shut down for more than nine hours between norristown and lansdale 
both suburbs of philadelphia 
police said two men were hurt in the first accident about nine 
miles north of norristown a car driven by gregory c damario 37 
of bayville nj was passing a tractortrailer loaded with used 
telephone poles when it went out of control hit the median 
guardrail and bounced into the back of the trailer said state 
trooper carl williams 
the trailer jackknifed and turned over so that the rig ended up 
skidding sideways blocking both northbound lanes and the shoulder 
williams said 
damario and barton washington 33 of philadelphia were taken 
to north penn hospital in lansdale damario for head neck and 
back injuries and washington for back and neck injuries

cars ahead a fire broke out and engulfed the truck and three cars 
williams said the tanker wasnt involved in the fire 
police withheld the names of the victims of the second accident

when word arrived that united airlines flight 232 
had crashed in sioux city a team of airline workers rushed into 
action to deal with human and technical emergencies and to limit 
damage to the airlines image 
uniteds performance in the hours following last weeks crisis 
won praise from several public relations experts although others 
criticized the airlines initial refusal to provide basic 
information to the public 
united told too little at first said matthew gonring a 
former public relations officer for the airline who works for usg 
corp 
when that happens the news media gravitates toward sources 
outside the company better to have information come from qualified 
sources than let bystanders speculate gonring said 
there were facts that were available at the time the rule of 
thumb is telling it all and telling it fast 
but others said united bolstered its credibility by releasing no 
misleading information that could have led to erroneous 
speculation even if executives withheld some knowledge of events 
surrounding the crash they also praised the airline for responding 
promptly and singled out chairman stephen wolfs decision to fly 
to the crash scene to meet with many victims and families 
it was a time for humanity and that showed concern said 
mary lou hedlund an executive in chicago with the hill amp knowlton 
international public relations company 
ms hedlund contrasted wolfs actions with those of exxon 
chairman lawrence rawl who was widely criticized for failing to 
visit the site where a company tanker ran aground off valdez 
alaska causing a huge oil spill in march 
big airline companies generally get gold stars in crisis 
communications she said exxon has a crisis plan and never 
tests it united and other airlines test theirs regularly 
uniteds crisis management response to the crash began almost 
immediately a news conference was quickly arranged with lawrence 
nagin senior vice president talking publicly about the disaster 
within four hours of it 
nagin expressed sorrow but declined to speculate on casualties 
or other aspects of the accident he refused to release the 
flights departure time and when pressed described the crash 
only as an inflight emergency that occurred but thats 
obvious 
united also initially dampened speculation about survivors and 
declined to release complete passenger lists while waiting for 
positive identification from the coroner in sioux city 
that angered some relatives seeking information about their 
loved ones 
but others said the cautious approach worked in the airlines 
favor when the number of survivors turned out to be larger than 
many had feared 
united didnt give out false or misleading information 
early said bob keyser a public relations consultant who used to 
work for mcdonalds corp 
you went to bed thinking many people had perished and you woke 
up to the reassuring news that many people had lived keyser said 
united officials defend their initial refusal to tell all 
we knew information about the aircraft and what the pilot said 
was going to be the central focus of the national transportation 
safety board investigation said united spokesman russell mack 
our policy is not to discuss information which properly should 
come out of the investigation process he said 
theres an enormous hunger for information at these times 
he said if you rush to fill in with anything at hand you can 
wind up making serious mistakes

the woody allen movie broadway danny 
rose made a lot of people laugh for wandra merrell the 
mid1980s film brings that certain feeling lamented its theme song 
agita an upset stomach 
a lawsuit she and her songwriting partner filed in us district 
court in trenton claims the verse melody of agita borrowed 49 
of the 52 notes in the verse of pepino the italian mouse ms 
merrell of cresskill and ray allen of long island ny wrote that 
early1960s novelty song which became a no 1 single for lou monte 
what the songwriters thought would be a simple copyright 
infringement case has turned into a fouryear legal battle with a 
jury trial still nowhere in sight 
its been absolute hell ms merrell said last week weve 
been working against the top guns orion pictures woody allen 
its like david vs goliath 
the 50 million copyright infringement lawsuit against allen and 
orion was dismissed last year by a judge after the defendants 
bought rights to pepino for 50000 from sbkemi music 
publishing co the pepino songwriters got none of the money 
from the retroactive deal 
ray allen and ms merrell claim the 50000 was peanuts and are 
angry they didnt get a share they are suing sbk for breach of 
fiduciary responsibility but the lawsuit remains mired in briefs 
and pretrial proceedings 
neither song involved could be considered serious fare 
pepino chronicles a mouse that does a chacha on the floor 
and agita waxes lustily about spicy food and its effects on 
ones digestive system 
but the financial stakes are serious 
the melody is heard 23 times in the movie and the film has had 
an estimated 2 million performances the plaintiffs say those 
prospective royalties and other damages reach well into the 
millions of dollars ms merrell said 
if people can steal what you have every songwriter in america 
is in jeopardy said george brown ms merrells husband and 
longtime manager in this court theyre allowing it so far 
orion pictures and allens publicists did not respond to 
requests for comment from the associated press 
sbk vice president and senior attorney harold rosenbloom issued 
a statement saying sbk is vigorously defending the action and 
we anticipate we will ultimately be successful 
he declined to comment further 
even though orion wound up paying the pepino publishers 
agita composer nick apollo forte denies that he copied the lou 
monte hit 
forte who also acted in broadway danny rose insisted in an 
interview that the song was entirely his own work and substantially 
different from pepino 
forte a nightclub performer and parttime boat skipper in snug 
harbor ri said he knows how his accusers feel when it comes to 
taking on the entertainment industry conglomerates he said he 
spent 40000 of his own money in legal fees more than he made 
from the movie he says to defend agita as his original work 
he says he finally decided to cut his losses and surrender 
theres one little part that sounds similar but the notes are 
different he said you cant fight the big companies 
ms merrell and ray allen claim the david role in this battle 
but theyre hardly industry midgets more than 200 of their songs 
have been recorded by various artists ms merrell says among 
them spanish nights a hit for connie francis and baby 
lover made popular by petula clark 
but their ditty about an italian mouse is probably their most 
enduring it reached no 1 on the charts in late 1962 and earned 
lou monte a gold record on frank sinatras reprise records 
she and her partner say four musicologists have verified their 
contention that the verses of pepino and agita are nearly 
identical but shes still a long way from getting a chance to 
prove it to a jury the next of many pretrial court hearings is 
scheduled in late august in trenton 
we know were going to win sooner or later ms merrell 
said but we dont want to die trying

miners in the kuznetsk coal basin 
of western siberia who began and won the first soviet industrial 
strike in 60 years say they do not want to emulate solidarity in 
poland by competing for power with the communist party 
but in some ways their initial demands and achievements exceed 
the 1980 victory of the polish shipyard workers and miners who 
struck for and won the right to form unions independent of 
government control 
solidaritys demands were too political our demands are only 
economical said pyotr i kungurov a member of the 26member 
regional strike committee in the kuznetsk basin or kuzbass 
after years of suppression solidarity emerged this spring as 
polands main opposition party controlling the senate and holding 
more than a third of the seats in the lower house solidarity hopes 
for further gains when local elections are held as early as next 
year and in national elections scheduled for 1993 
likewise soviet miners have helped change the political 
landscape of the socialist world by seizing from the communist 
party the initiative in voicing the demands of workers 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia noted the ironic turn 
of events in a frontpage editorial saturday evening 
those who are striking are part of the working class the most 
advanced and conscious class didnt you know that isvestia 
commentator valeri vyzhutovich wrote he quoted karl marx 
described by soviet sociologists as the founder of scientific 
socialism as saying that freedom from management was a prime 
goal of the working class 
the kuzbass miners who began striking july 11 returned to work 
friday after winning what they described as largely economic 
concessions 
but the fire they sparked has spread with about half the 
nations 1 million coal miners on strike in the ukraine kazakhstan 
and the arctic 
polish workers began to seize control over their own destiny in 
1980 by creating a new organization solidarity and sticking with 
it through the repression of martial law 
soviet workers are striving toward similar goals by taking 
control of existing organizations such as official trade unions 
local governments and management bodies 
soviet strikers appear to like president mikhail s gorbachev 
kungurov describing gorbachev as very popular among miners 
said the soviet leader began the reforms from above now we are 
helping him from below 
kremlin leaders he said want to decide things for themselves 
but now the workers are coming up with their own initiatives it 
will be an impulse for perestroika he said using the russian 
word for gorbachevs economic reforms 
although the siberian miners say their demands are not 
political the first article of the protocol that sent them back to 
work gives them greater control over mines and industry starting 
jan 1 
that concession is a major one in an economy where for 72 years 
decisionmaking power has been concentrated largely in moscow it 
means intially that mines will be allowed to form local and 
regional associations for selfmanagement and may sell to the 
highest bidder coal produced over and above what they agree to sell 
to the state 
eventually the miners hope to eliminate the zakaz or quota 
entirely and sell all production on the open market using the 
profits to modernize their industry and improve living standards 
in the meantime they won from central authorities a commitment 
to improve wages pensions and other benefits boost deliveries of 
consumer goods build more housing and extend vacations 
the kuznetsk strike committee renamed the workers committee 
after the strike also joined with a halfdozen kuzbass members of 
the national congress of peoples deputies on friday to demand that 
parliament schedule municipal elections in november instead of next 
spring as planned 
the leadership of the national parliament met saturday with 
representatives of the 15 soviet republics to consider plans for 
the election the official news agency tass reported the report 
did not say whether the session was in response to the demands of 
the kuzbass miners 
the workers committee also has begun efforts to take over the 
official trade unions 
the miners of prokopyevsk expressed a newfound confidence and a 
determination to make sure that the government implements its 
promises and makes more concessions 
the first question is to see that the first agreement is 
implemented committee chairman teimuraz g avaliani said at a 
meeting friday the second question facing us is to work out a 
new agreement with the government to give us more concrete 
benefits

the massachusetts port authority has been ordered 
to pay 629 million to world airways for its liability in a 1982 
plane crash at logan international airport 
massport officials said they would appeal fridays ruling by 
us district court judge robert e keeton who also ruled the 
airline could recover an additional 16 million from the federal 
government 
in earlier trials federal juries ruled that the authority and 
the federal aviation administration were to blame for the january 
1982 crash which killed two people 
the dc10 carrying 212 passengers attempted to land on an icy 
runway at logan but slid off the runway and into boston harbor 
the nose of the plane was severed from the fuselage and passengers 
and crew had to swim in the frigid waters to safety 
while the juries determined massport and the federal government 
were to blame for not taking adequate safety measures in icy 
conditions the amount of the settlement remained to be determined 
and questions of interest remained in dispute until friday 
the total set by keeton takes into account 33 million for the 
value of the aircraft interest over the seven years since the 
accident and several passenger claims the boston globe reported 
attorneys in the case told the newspaper that massport may be 
able to recover 11 million of the total settlement from the 
federal government because the faa was also found at fault 
other issues in the case still remain unresolved however 
keeton must rule on motion for a new trial relating to emotional 
distress claimed by crew members 
the pilot peter langley and his copilot were awarded 2 
million in damages in april but keeton ruled that that amount was 
excessive and planned to reduce it by 80 percent the newspaper 
said

extremists in an ethnically torn region 
of soviet georgia ambushed a police patrol killing two cadets and 
seized more than 1500 weapons in raids on police stations across 
the region soviet media said saturday 
troops patrolled the riottorn abkhazia region where 19 people 
have died in a week of violence between minority abkhazians and 
ethnic georgians 
in the capital of sukhumi fear hangs over the city the 
georgian newspaper zarya vostoka said 
the feeling is especially strong at night the newspaper 
said thats when the gunfire starts in again and the noise is 
breaking glass revving tanks and explosions 
the capital has been under a state of emergency since tuesday 
as a result of the violence two regional party secretaries were 
fired and two government leaders in abkhazia lost their jobs the 
official tass news agency said 
the attack on the police patrol occurred friday night in the 
village of ostapi in akbhazia a black sea resort area 
tass said assailants opened fire on the police patrol with 
hunting rifles killing two cadets as they roadblocks and 
confiscated weapons 
the violence reportedly was sparked by abkhazian demands to 
secede from georgia 
col gen yuri shatalin the commander of the all internal 
security troops who rushed to the republic to take charge told the 
government newspaper izvestia that abkhazian and georgian 
extremists had attacked eight police stations and two sports shops 
in western georgia over the past 24 hours 
as a result 1441 rifles are in the hands of extremists he 
said 
earlier attacks on police stations netted extremists hundreds of 
weapons including 56 submachine guns 40 pistols and three machine 
guns izvestia said 
shatalin blamed the seizure of the weapons on the careless or 
treacherous behavior of police apparently members of the local 
ethnic groups since the strife began police have confiscated more 
than 2700 firearms 
he described one battle between abkhazians and georgians on a 
bridge in the village of otap on the ochamchirsky region last 
sunday there were 250 to 300 people from each side who took part 
in it he said i havent seen such a battle since my service 
in afghanistan 
meetings between abkhazians and georgians took place in the 
cities of sukhumi and gagra on friday izvestia said but did not 
produce any concrete results and were characterized by mutual 
reprimands 
a plenum of the regional party committee of abkhazia met and 
fired mikhail a tsuladze and said r tarkil from their jobs as 
communist party secretaries tass said 
the presidium of the abkhazian supreme soviet fired premier otar 
zugbaya and his first deputy vm tsugba tass said those 
relieved of their posts appeared to include abkhazians and 
georgians although tass did not specify their nationalities 
the tbilisi newspaper zarya vostoka said the situation in 
sukhumi was tense and that industry was shut down and rail and city 
transport halted by strikes apparently by ethnic georgians 
complaining that abkhazians control all key jobs in the region 
it quoted the head of the railroad strike committee murman 
fkhulukhia as saying that georgian leaders were ignoring their 
demands which include the resignation of abkhazian leaders 
arrests of the instigators of violence and a change in the 
personnel policies of abkhazia 
he said party leader givi gumbaridze came to listen to their 
demands at 3 am last monday he heard us out but since then 
not a single one of our leaders party or government has come to 
see us he said arent they interested in the fact that 750 
people are on strike and as a result the railroads are at a 
standstill 
thousands of tourists were being evacuated from the popular 
summer resort are of sukumi the safety is fully ensured of 
vacationing children and adults as they leaving abkhazia tass 
said 
the news agency said violence also flared friday in the republic 
of tadzhikistan in central asia 1500 miles southeast of moscow 
when a fight broke out between two men of different nationalities 
the fight grew into a conflict between two groups armed with 
chains sticks and stones tass said the battle ended when 
police fired shots into the air tass said fortythree people were 
detained 
the news agency did not identify the nationalities of the 
combatants although fighting was reported over water rights in the 
republic earlier this month between tadzhiks and kirghiz both 
nationalities are moslem the kirghiz speak a turkic dialect and 
the tadzhiks speak persian 
at least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past 
month in the southern soviet republics of georgia azerbaijan

talks aimed at settling a border dispute 
between chad and libya failed because libyas leader demanded that 
french troops be withdrawn from chad president hissene habre said 
saturday 
habre and his longtime enemy col moammar gadhafi met in mali 
on thursday and friday for their first talks in seven years 
the presidents of four other african nations who mediated 
reported that progress was being made but the talks broke off 
friday without an agreement 
the main dispute involves the aouzou strip a 45600squaremile 
border area thought to be rich in uranium that libya occupies and 
chad claims 
returning home saturday habre said gadhafi insisted on the 
withdrawal of extraafrican troops from chad before any 
settlement could be reached 
gadhafi left the talks without commenting 
france maintains 1500 soldiers in chad to back habre whose own 
army chased out libyan occupiers from most of northern chad in 1987 
chads ambassador to france allammi ahmad said libyan 
intransigence was behind the failure of the talks he told the 
french news agency agence francepresse that gadhafi refused to 
take the border dispute to the international court of justice in 
the hague refused to demilitarize the aouzou strip in extreme 
northern chad and demanded the withdrawal of french troops 
the french army is in chad at the demand of chadian 
authorites the ambassador said and will not leave until there 
are no longer any threats 
the talks were mediated by the leaders of gabon algeria mali 
and nigeria under a proposed agreement drafted by officials from 
mali and algeria chad and libya would have tried to settle the 
aouzou border issue by political means meaning negotiations within 
the organization of african unity and take it to the international 
court of justice if those attempts failed 
it also called for a treaty of friendship a pledge by each 
nation not to attack the other and creation of an oau observer 
force to stabilize a yearold truce 
all prisoners would be repatriated chad is said to hold at 
least 2000 libyans but libya says it has returned all captured 
chadians 
sources in mali said friday that habre objected to several 
points in the proposed settlement including the immediate return 
of war prisoners 
since gadhafi gained power in 1969 he has supported several 
antigovernment groups in chad libyas southern neighbor they 
included habres own faction when he was a guerrilla leader 
after a libyan invasion government troops and allied french 
soldiers drove libyan forces out in 1987 france the colonial 
power until independence in 1960 has 1500 soldiers in chad to 
support habre libya has kept its foothold in the aouzou strip 
which has been in dispute for decades 
last month habre accused libya of preparing an attack from 
sudan chads eastern neighbor with chadian dissidents sudan and 
libya denied the charges

a judge saturday sentenced 10 greek 
cypriots to three days in jail for entering the turkishoccupied 
sector of cyprus during a protest last week outside court turkish 
cypriots protested the punishments as too lenient 
hundreds of greek cypriots mostly women continued a sitdown 
protest outside the nicosia headquarters of the un peacekeeping 
force hundreds more wrestled with un troops at a buffer zone 
near the village of peristerona 16 miles west of nicosia the 
capital 
the swelling demonstrations the most prolonged since the 1974 
turkish invasion threatened to undermine 10 months of 
unsponsored talks on reunification between president george 
vassiliou the greek cypriot leader and turkish cypriot leader 
rauf denktash 
they are scheduled to meet again july 26 but denktash has 
indicated he may not attend the closeddoor session because of the 
greek cypriot protests 
the 10 defendants convicted and sentenced saturday could have 
received up to 18 months in prison eight were also fined 100 
each two clergymen were fined 200 
they were in a group of 108 greek cypriots arrested by turkish 
authorities wednesday while protesting on the eve of the turkish 
invasion the other 98 defendants all women have not stood trial 
judge gonul orenen in the turkish cypriot nicosia district 
court said she gave very lenient sentences to the men to keep 
relations between the rival communities from deteriorating further 
if the fines are not paid within 24 hours the clergymen will 
serve 10 more days in prison and the other eight men five more 
days she said 
the 108 detainess were charged with entering a restricted 
military zone and violating the borders of the breakaway turkish 
republic of northern cyprus it was proclaimed in 1983 but is 
recognized only by turkey 
the sentencing was delayed when more than 1000 turkish 
cypriots shouting murderer priest demonstrated outside the 
courthouse 
the crowd demanded tougher sentences when they heard judge 
orenens decision 
more than 500 greek cypriots demonstrated in the buffer zone 
near peristerona 16 miles west of nicosia to dramatize their 
eviction from philia a greek cypriot village occupied when the 
turks invaded on july 20 1974 
the turks invaded ostensibly to protect the turkish cypriot 
minority in the wake of a shortlived coup by supporters of a union 
with greece 
philia is less than two miles from peristerona its inhabitants 
try to penetrate un lines to reach their village every year on 
the anniversary of the invasion 
greek cypriot policemen fearing a confrontation between the 
demonstrators and turkish cypriots tried to stop the women but 
were quickly overwhelmed 
some 200 soldiers of the danish contingent of the un force in 
cyprus manned four lines of barbedwire barricades to confront any 
penetration of the buffer zone but the demonstrators argued and 
scuffled with the soldiers and some 100 of them slipped through 
three lines only to be stopped at the last barricade 
the protesters at peristerona waved banners saying we demand 
our rights and implementation of un resolutions 
that was a reference to a series of un security council 
resolutions calling for the withdrawal of 35000 turkish soldiers 
and some 50000 settlers from the north and the return of some 
200000 greek cypriot refugees to their homes in the occupied third 
of the island

nearly 200000 palestinian 
children returned to classrooms in the west bank on saturday after 
the army lifted an order that had kept their schools closed for 
most of the 19month uprising 
israels histadrut labor federation called for a twohour 
nationwide strike sunday to protest the governments handling of 
the economy unions affliated with histadrut represent 85 percent 
of israels 25 million workers 
the nations unemployment rate rose to 96 percent in may and 
the labor ministry predicts it could exceed 10 percent before 
years end for the worst jobless rate since the 196567 recession 
israel radio said that at the sunday cabinet meeting finance 
minister shimon peres will unveil a public works program aimed at 
creating jobs 
thirteen palestinians were reportedly shot and wounded saturday 
in stonethrowing clashes with israeli troops in the west bank and 
gaza strip one victim was a 14yearold girl hit in the chest with 
one of the rubbercoated metal pellets the army uses for riot 
control arab hospital officials said 
an army spokesman said soldiers encountered stonethrowers in 
several early morning raids in west bank villages and confirmed 
that one palestinian youth was shot and wounded in a raid on the 
village of nur shams near nablus 
at least 572 palestinians and 37 israelis have been killed since 
the uprising against israeli rule began in december 1987 
classes opened for elementary schoolchildren and high school 
seniors who must sit for mandatory graduation exams in november 
but the army has not yet set a date for the remaining 100000 
junior high and high school students in the west bank to return to 
class and said that all institutions will be closed again if 
violence occurs 
if you want to learn you have the opportunity to do so 
said brig gen shaike erez head of the west bank military 
government if you dont that is your choice too 
the army has kept west bank schools closed for all but two short 
intervals since the start of the palestinian revolt contending 
they were focal points for violence they were last open in january 
palestinians charge it was a form of collective punishment 
and the united states and international human rights organizations 
have urged that classes be reopened 
on saturday the sounds of children reciting arabic and 
practicing multiplication tables could be heard in both boys and 
girls elementary schools in bethlehem 
studies in the village of beit fajar six miles south of 
bethlehem were disrupted when tear gas fired by soldiers drifted 
into the girls school the army said troops fired the tear gas to 
disperse stonethrowers nearby otherwise the opening day passed 
without major incidents 
school principals said attendance was more than 90 percent 
despite a strike called by the fundamentalist moslem group hamas 
or zeal which closed shops and shut down public transportation 
hamas issued a leaflet exempting students from the strike and 
graffiti on walls in ramallah north of jerusalem signed by hamas 
supporters said with stones and pens the blessed uprising 
continues 
im glad to be going back said 9yearold lina humseyeh as 
she waited in bethlehem for a private school bus to take her to her 
thirdgrade class i helped my mother when we didnt have school 
but i was bored 
the teacher of linas english class nadal barham said she 
thought closing the schools had increased rather than reduced 
violence in the uprising known by the arabic word intefadeh 
i think that when students have something else to do not 
just demonstrate it will decrease the intefadeh she said 
while the army ordered schools closed in the west bank shortly 
after the the uprising began classes have continued for more than 
150000 students in the gaza strip colleges universities and 
vocational schools in both territories remain shut affecting 
20000 students

talks aimed at ending the nations 14year 
civil war were suspended saturday when the rebel delegation 
requested consultations with their leaders about a proposal to 
monitor a ceasefire according to news reports 
reports on rebelrun voice of the black rooster radio monitored 
in luanda from the guerrillas bush headquarters of jamba said the 
rebels asked mediating president mobutu sese seko of zaire to allow 
them one week of necessary consultations 
the talks held in kinshasa zaires capital started wednesday 
it was the second session between the usbacked rebels of the 
national union for the total independence of angola and 
representatives of angolan president jose eduardo dos santos 
according to reports in kinshasa the talks are to resume on july 
31 
the reports said the rebels wanted to discuss mobutus proposals 
for a hot line radio link between luanda jamba and kinshasa to 
help monitor a june 24 ceasefire agreed to by rebel leader jonas 
savimbi and dos santos 
the talks were held behind closed doors but reports from zaire 
said the government delegation headed by armed forces chief 
antonio dos santos franca accepted mobutus proposal 
there was no immediate confirmation from the angolan government 
or the official media in luanda 
dos santos withdrew his delegation from the first round of talks 
in kinshasa on july 1 after only two days claiming the rebels had 
violated the truce 
reports of ceasefire violations continued as the second round 
ended on saturday 
the angolan state news agency angop reported that an 
unspecified number of civilians were killed wounded or missing in 
guerrilla attacks in four northern and central provinces 
the rebels have said government forces also have violated the 
ceasefire

accord containing the ceasefire 
the angolan government claims savimbi pledged to leave the 
country temporarily while members of his movement return to 
civilian life 
savimbi has denied that he agreed to exile and rebel spokesmen 
have rejected integration calling instead for the formation of a 
transitional government comprised of members from both sides to 
prepare general elections 
the rebels have been fighting to share control since a marxist 
government took power shortly after angolas independence from 
portugal in 1975 
the guerrillas have not explicitly stated their political and 
economic philosophy but they generally are prowestern favor a 
multiparty democracy with regular elections and appear to support 
a mixed economy 
the united states sends military aid to the rebels south africa 
also provided support until it signed a regional peace accord last 
december that required a halt to the assistance

a guerrilla war in suriname has 
ended in a truce that will allow the rebels to keep their weapons 
and eventually join the south american nations police force dutch 
newspapers reported saturday 
suriname and the jungle commando rebels signed the truce friday 
in french guiana the accord calls for an end to fighting that 
reportedly has killed hundreds of people in the countrys eastern 
regions over the last three years 
the truce was immediately criticized by surinames army which 
ruled the former dutch colony until 1987 the reports said 
the accord signed in kourou french guiana says the rebels 
will not be disarmed but instead withdraw to three locations until 
they are later enlisted in a special police unit the dutch reports 
said 
in a statement released after the signing ceremony the 
surinamese army demanded the rebel group surrender its weapons and 
said its police role would be unconstitutional the reports 
said the armys approval of the truce is regarded as crucial to 
its chances of succeeding 
the rebels are led by ronnie brunswijk 27 who served as a 
bodyguard to lt col desi bouterse when he was surinames 
military ruler from 19801987 bouterse yielded power to a civilian 
government after elections two years ago but the dutchtrained 
army still has considerable influence in surinamese politics under 
a state of emergency in large parts of the nation 
brunswijk agreed to a ceasefire in late 1987 but skirmishing 
continued in the guerrilla war until last month 
the truce also calls for an end to the state of emergency and 
for an aid program for eastern suriname where brunswijk has his 
power base among the 65000member bush negro minority 
the brunswijk group was never more than 200 soldiers strong but 
it effectively controlled large areas of suriname 
by late 1986 the conflict had flared into a major guerrilla 
war with brunswijk troops nearing surinames capital paramaribo 
the rebel cause was strengthened when government troops burned 
several bush negro villages suspected of harboring rebels in 
attacks that left at least 35 people dead 
about 7000 people mostly bush negroes fled eastern suriname 
to neighboring french guiana during the insurgency the bush 
negroes are descendants of west african slaves brought to the 
country by dutch colonists 
brunswijk is a bush negro and a cubantrained soldier he was 
bouterses bodyguard until being fired in 1986 
details of their falling out are unknown but the war was seen 
as a personal feud between brunswijk and the 42yearold bouterse 
after his dismissal brunswijk is said to have taken weapons and 
ammunition with him he robbed banks and gave the money to his 
people gaining the reputation of a robin hood but in june 1986 
bouterses army attacked brunswijks village and the jungle 
commando was born

an american airlines flight bound for el 
paso texas from chicago lost one of its main hydraulic systems 
saturday forcing the cockpit crew to manually lower the front 
landing gear before landing safely here 
the loss of the single hydraulic system on the boeing 727 was 
far less serious than the reported complete hydraulic failure of 
united airlines flight 232 on wednesday said john hotard 
spokesman for american airlines in fort worth texas 
the united dc10 crashed in sioux city iowa killing at least 
110 of the more than 295 people on board 
well for one thing its a different airplane hotard said 
the pilot just had one of his systems failure and there are 
several redundant systems on the plane 
asked whether the failure of a single hydraulic system was 
unusual hotard responded 
certainly it scared the hell out of us but the pilot had 
no trouble landing he made a routine perfect landing 
flight 139 had 110 people on board including the crew and was 
scheduled to make a stop at tulsa international airport at 112 
pm the pilot radioed to the tulsa control tower at 119 pm 
that the jet was experiencing hydraulic problems and he couldnt 
get the front landing gear down hotard said 
there was a failure of what they call the system a hydraulics 
system and this among other things controls the raising and the 
lowering of the landing gear he said and because this system 
failed and we do not know yet why it failed the captain and the 
cockpit crew had to handcrank the right main landing gear 
its not that difficult to do 
when system a failed system b took the backup for the other 
sytems of the aircraft hotard said 
there were no injuries reported in the incident 
the plane which was just over 40 miles northeast from tulsa 
international when it reported problems landed at 158 pm 
hotard said 
the plane was towed to americans main maintanance facility the 
passengers traveling on to el paso were taken on a separate 
aircraft hotard said 
the 727 will be overhauled and serviced to determine what caused 
the hydraulic problem he said

texas the friendship state maybe 
dont mess with texas would do a better job of lassoing support 
for a state license plate slogan 
texans who pride themselves in their tough cowboy image say 
having their state license plates read the friendship state is 
too wimpy now they just say texas 
callers on friday inundated the texas department of highways and 
public transportation over the proposed change 
i dont think the defenders of the alamo would want to defend 
those kinds of license plates said austin police sgt robert 
pewitt who polled his colleagues and offered his opinion to the 
highway department 
its not that texans dont want to be known as friendly pewitt 
said we are friendly but people will realize that when they get 
here he said 
lona reeves an information specialist with the highway 
department said she fielded 50 telephone calls during the first 
three hours of the working day friday all were opposed to the 
change she said 
all of them have been very polite but one guy was very 
uncalled for in his description of the new slogan he said it was 
too wimpy ms reeves said 
earlier this week the texas highway commission approved the 
slogan for license plates beginning next spring 
officials said they wanted to put forth a less aggressive image 
by using the friendship state to promote tourism 
we are surprised people are reacting the way they are said 
mark ball an assistant to highway commission chairman robert 
dedman 
ball said the change was made partially in response to 
complaints over the highway departments awardwinning dont mess 
with texas antilittering campaign 
although the dont mess with texas slogan has been 
successful ball said highway officials continue to hear from a 
contingent who say it is too tough 
the commission voted 30 for the name change but ball noted 
that in 1985 commissioners also voted 30 to change the license 
plate to the wildflower state 
after a public outcry officials reversed themselves

japanese voted sunday in parliamentary elections in 
which the governing conservatives were expected to lose ground to 
the main opposition party because of stock and sex scandals and an 
unpopular sales tax 
japans 903 million eligible voters began casting ballots at 7 
am to fill half the seats in the 252member upper house of 
parliament known as the house of councillors 
results in many districts were expected by 2 am monday 1 pm 
sunday edt but counting in tokyo and some other large districts 
will not begin until monday with final results expected by evening 
on saturday prime minister sousuke uno attacked the rival 
socialist party in a final campaign speech while the socialist 
leader urged voters to make clear your disgust with unos 
scandalplagued government 
a poor showing by unos conservative liberal democrats could 
increase pressure on uno in office less than two months to resign 
and lead to early elections for the more powerful lower house of 
parliament 
a liberal democratic loss there could bring japan a 
socialistled government since the lower house elects the prime 
minister 
socialism does not fit in japan please help us defend freedom 
in this country uno 66 told several hundred workers of his 
liberal democratic party he praised his partys record in raising 
japans status in the world 
personally hobbled by allegations he kept paid mistresses uno 
made few public appearances during the 18day campaign and his last 
was in a secluded parking lot at party headquarters 
by contrast takako doi chairwoman of the japan socialist 
party held her final campaign rally at a main intersection 
now is the time we can change politics and the energy is 
beginning to move ms doi said assailing scandals and a new 
sales tax tomorrow is your big chance to make clear your 
disgust 
polls analysts and even many liberal democrats cast the 
governing party as an underdog in the voting for 126 of the 252 
seats in the house of councilors recent polls by three major 
national newspapers indicated the party would win only 30 to 42 
seats far short of the 54 it needs to maintain a simple majority 
final results are expected monday evening 
an upper house majority remains beyond the laborbacked 
socialists reach as they would need to win 84 seats and are 
running only 54 candidates with expectations of about 40 winners 
that would boost their overall total in the house from the current 
43 to about 60 
thus they have led efforts to create an opposition coalition 
with three other parties the no 2 opposition komeito clean 
government party the democratic socialists and the socialist 
democratic federation which now has no seats in the upper chamber 
a defeat would be a historic setback for the party that has 
produced all of japans prime ministers and held majorities in both 
houses since it was formed in 1955 
without control of the upper house the liberal democrats would 
find it awkward though not impossible to pass legislation 
the popularity of the governing party began to erode last summer 
with the first disclosures in a scandal that led to the 
resignations of three cabinet ministers and ultimately prime 
minister noboru takeshita 
the recruit co a publishing conglomerate was accused of 
selling millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and making 
political donations to obtain favors from politicians with much of 
its elite tainted by recruit the liberal democrats were unable to 
select a new prime minister for more than one month 
shortly after uno took office june 2 reports began to appear 
that he had kept paid mistresses igniting criticism from womens 
groups uno has said he did nothing immoral 
meanwhile the opposition rallied antigovernment sentiment 
against a 3 percent sales tax that took effect april 1 claiming it 
created an unfair burden on lowerincome households 
the liberal democrats pushed a tax reform package including the 
new levy through parliament late last year over an opposition 
boycott in a nation where consensus is highly valued the party 
was criticized for ignoring opposition views 
the opposition put forward a record number of women candidates 
to win the votes of women who encountered the new tax in their 
daily shopping 
farmers an important source of liberal democratic support also 
revolted against government moves made under strong pressure from 
the united states to open japans market wider to agricultural 
products 
a record 40 parties and 670 candidates are running sunday 
voters will elect 76 legislators in districts and another 50 
nationwide in the nationwide voting voters write in the name of 
the party they support and the 50 seats are apportioned on the 
basis of each partys percentage of the total vote 
though the socialists are headed by a popular chairwoman they 
have been widely accused of lacking a realistic and unified 
platform partly because of a small but powerful radical left wing 
in the past they have called for japan to disband its 
selfdefense forces and scrap the usjapan security treaty under 
which about 64000 american troops are stationed in japan 
socialist leaders when pressed say they would not immediately 
do away with the armed forces and seek only to revise the treaty 
but ms doi and others have said on several occasions that all 
american warships entering japanese ports should be carefully 
inspected and denied entry if nuclear arms are found aboard

all people to prevent violent protests by relatives or a possible 
north korean threat to ms kim

a recent verdict reviving the historic brown 
vs topeka board of education case was withdrawn without 
explanation by a federal appeals court in denver baffling both 
sides in the case 
attorneys for both sides said they found out about the decision 
friday and said they were unsure what the unusual action by the 
court means for the topeka school system 
were in the same position now as if no opinion had ever been 
filed said robert hoecker clerk of the 10th us circuit court 
of appeals in denver 
in 1987 us district court judge richard rogers of topeka 
ruled that topekas public school district had no illegal 
intentional systematic or residual separation of races 
in june the appeals court overturned rogers ruling it said 
the topeka school system had not done enough to overcome remnants 
of the segregated school system that existed before the us 
supreme court decided the landmark brown vs topeka board of 
education case in 1954 
the appeals court ordered rogers to devise a remedy for what it 
called the racially identifiable public schools in topeka 
topeka lawyers involved in the case said the new opinion they 
found out about friday was brief stating without explanation that 
the appeals court had withdrawn its opinion and vacated last 
months judgment in the case 
no one seems to know exactly what this means topeka 
superintendent gary livingston said well be meeting with our 
counsel next week to try to filter out what the implications are 
individuals on both sides of the case said all they could do was 
wait for another decision from the appeals court 
charles henson an attorney for topekas board of education 
said the action friday meant the case would still have to be 
reviewed by the court 
my understanding is that this has the effect of restoring the 
case as a pending one before the 10th circuit court henson said 
the effect of this order is to say that rogers opinion is still 
pending or that the appeal has not been decided as to what will 
happen next well just have to wait and see 
rich jones an attorney for the plaintiffs said the court had 
been asking for several records from the us district court in 
topeka during the last few weeks 
when i got this letter friday it looked like an order 
asking for another record and lo and behold it said they were 
withdrawing from the decision made june 2 he said 
the 1954 brown vs board of education case struck down as 
unconstitutional the concept of separate but equal public 
schools for different races 
the case was reopened in 1979 when the parents of 17 black 
topeka public school children sought a decision on whether the 
schools had eliminated traces of the segregated system 
the group contended the district had not eliminated vestiges of 
segregation the parents included linda brown buckner who as a 
student in 1954 gave the landmark case its name 
the parents had pointed to seven elementary schools and one 
middle school that they said had a disproportionately high number 
of minority students

former secretary of housing samuel r pierce jr 
intervened with a client of former massachusetts sen edward w 
brooke to get a hud project approved according to a published 
report 
the new york times reported in sunday newspapers that brooke 
who was well known as a housing specialist while in the senate in 
1985 was promoting a boston engineering and management firm paul 
parks amp associates 
the firm headed by parks a democrat who is a former state 
education secretary in massachusetts in 1986 and 1987 received 
more than 400000 in financing from a discretionary fund 
maintained by pierce the paper said 
brooke told the times that he recalled helping parks in his 
application to hud 
brooke wrote in a nov 5 1985 letter to pierce thank you for 
your personal attention to the paul parks amp associates proposal 
for which he and i are grateful 
but brooke told the times he did not recall what role if any 
was played by pierce in awarding the money 
the newspaper quoted parks as saying he was unaware of the 
letter but was not surprised it was sent to pierce 
eddie may have written to the secretary on my behalf because 
as i say were personal friends he said i appreciate him 
doing that but i can assure you it was purely a thing of letting 
pierce know that we are friends 
in april a hud audit showed brooke had received 183000 from 
clients seeking assistance under the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program 
the program was intended to encourage developers to rehabilitate 
lowincome housing it was suspended for a time earlier this year 
because of allegations of widespread political favoritism 
a telephone call made to a listing for brooke in washington

opposition politicans said friday 
they will hold more demonstrations to demand that their candidates 
in the may elections be allowed to take office on schedule in 
september 
we are willing to go to the front and take the risks and 
consequences of these acts said guillermo endara the opposition 
presidential candidate in may 7 elections 
the announcement came a day after the organization of american 
states called for a democratic transfer of power on sept 1 
followed by new elections the decision in effect accepts gen 
manuel antonio noriegas nullification of the may balloting 
international observers said endaras slate won the election by 
a 31 margin they said noriega head of the panamanian defense 
forces and the nations de facto ruler had the balloting annulled 
when it became apparent his candidate carlos duque was losing 
the oas mediated talks between the government and opposition 
last weekend but the opposition discounted the organization after 
it announced its position on the political standoff 
we should stop experimenting with international solidarity 
endara said we the panamanians are the only ones responsible 
for our own destiny 
he said the opposition had been assured that the oas mediation 
was something marvelous but since it hasnt turned out to be 
something marvelous since it has not known how to grasp our 
problem we simply have to tell them goodbye and follow our own 
path 
he did not say when the public protests would begin or what form 
they would take 
opposition demonstrations held frequently for several weeks in 
1988 to demand that noriega leave often were broken up by riot 
police using rubber truncheons and water cannons that sprayed a mix 
of water and tear gas 
after the may election thugs beat opposition protesters 
injuring endara and one of his vice presidential candidates 
guillermo ford 
the current presidential term expires sept 1 manuel solis 
palma has been acting president since noriega had eric arturo 
delvalle fired in february 1988 a day after delvalle had tried to 
oust the general 
earlier that month noriega was indicted in the united states on 
drug trafficking charges noriega denies the charges and has 
resisted us political and economic pressure to force him to step 
down 
an oas mission began working in midjuly to try to resolve the 
crisis the talks last weekend were the first between the two sides 
since the election 
endara said opposition officials will meet soon to decide 
whether to continue negotiating with the government

reservation sealed off from outsiders after a gambling raid that 
left indian leaders debating whether to legalize the casinos as a 
revenue source 
the community of akwesasne on the st regis mohawk reservation 
has been closed to nonresidents since thursday morning when 225 
state troopers and fbi agents raided five casinos the officers 
confiscated an undetermined amount of cash and financial records 
and arrested 10 people 
it was the second crackdown in two months and the first 
involving federal authorities on gambling at the reservation which 
straddles the st lawrence river along the uscanadian border 
illegal casinos on the reservation employ about 500 people and 
attract busloads of gamblers authorities say 
state police maj ronald brooks said he was not sure when the 
blockade would be lifted he said police continued to restrict 
access to the reservation because of the potential for violence or 
hostagetaking 
the mohawks reservation security force also continued to 
maintain roadblocks friday indians piled up logs on a state road 
through the reservation and at other points used an overturned 
flatbed trailer and a gas tanker to block the route 
art montour a spokesman for the security force said the 
confrontation might drag on for weeks 
it has got to be resolved either they police drop the h 
bomb or they have to make some concessions he said 
although police said the situation on the reservation was 
volatile a woman who answered the phone at the tribal council 
office said the atmosphere was relaxed 
everybodys just going about their business she said 
declining to give her name 
a special tribal meeting was held friday to discuss a possible 
gaming ordinance for the reservation 
lincoln white one of three tribal chiefs on the american side 
of the reservation said tribal leaders voted overwhelmingly to 
hold a referendum july 29 on whether to legalize some forms of 
gambling 
white a proponent of keeping the reservations casinos in 
business said the plan would allow bingo card games like poker 
and blackjack and roulette in indian gaming houses it would not 
allow slot machines he said 
john brunetti a spokesman for the us magistrates office in 
syracuse said the tribe could approve some forms of gambling such 
as bingo but not slot machines and other gambling machines that 
were the target of the raid 
tony laughing owner of tonys vegas international predicted 
reservation residents would authorize gambling in a referendum 
laughings casino was among those authorities planned to raid 
thursday however police were unable to locate laughing and an 
armed group of about 15 mohawks prevented police from entering his 
building and the bears den another casino bears den owner eli 
tarbell also eluded police 
laughing said casino owners have agreed to turn over as much as 
60 percent of their profits to the tribe he estimated the 
reservations seven casinos could add between 2 million and 3 
million to the tribes coffers

a sweeping roundtheclock crackdown along a major maine to 
florida highway known as a drug corridor was called a success 
friday but drug arrests were not as abundant as police had hoped 
almost 10800 traffic citations were issued for offenses from 
speeding to drunken driving during the 24hour crackdown along 
interstate 95 police said 
but the number of drug seizures and arrests numbered was much 
lower 
the international association of chiefs of police which 
organized the operation said in a statement friday the operation 
was the first time every state traversed by a specific highway 
committed resources for a coordinated operation 
the washington dcbased organization said 10799 traffic 
citations were issued and 100 drunken drivers were arrested in 
addition 297 criminal arrests were made with 570 charges filed 
including 355 drugrelated charges 
this was a pioneer effort the statement said the numbers 
achieved during the 24hour operation likely mean that other 
corridors in other states will be candidates for similar saturation 
programs 
in drug arrests 65876 grams of marijuana 5671 grams of 
cocaine and 340 grams of crack were seized but police said they 
had hoped to nab more drug traffickers they said they believed 
drug dealers were aware of the sweep which ended friday morning 
its doubtful anything was moving said georgia state patrol 
spokesman jd coleman it could have been the publicity or 
they just all drove very safely 
you always hope for a magnificent seizure on the highway 
coleman said but we took some dangerous drivers off the highway 
maybe we saved some lives thats the bottom line 
the effort was named operation coflame because it was a 
cooperative operation that ran from florida to maine 
during the dragnet a few stolen cars were recovered and 
fugitives captured a jacksonville fla man was jailed on drug 
trafficking charges and virginia state troopers seized 140 pounds 
of marijuana from one traveler 
in virginia 37 people were arrested on various criminal charges 
and 2461 traffic citations were issued said state police 
spokeswoman mary evans 
twentyeight of the arrests were drug related she said eight 
people were charged with driving while impaired 
among the drug arrests was john p demorest 40 of new haven 
conn who was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to 
distribute after police seized 140 pounds from his vehicle said 
virginia state patrol lt wl bowman 
during other stops officers seized four grams of cocaine and 
two grams of crack a potent cocaine derivative ms evans said 
in georgia troopers issued 484 traffic citations 310 of which 
were speeding tickets and 21 for drunken driving in 20 
drugrelated arrests officers seized 380 grams of marijuana a 
gram of crack cocaine a fraction of a kilo of cocaine and 
1526 in currency coleman said 
for georgia it was not a major drug thing he said 
officers arrested five people at a rural georgia weigh station 
and recovered a stolen car carrying luxury car parts 
south carolinas highway patrol reported more than 300 traffic 
citations on its 200mile stretch of i95 by friday morning said 
spokesman brian ellison 
connecticut state police netted 1 kilograms of cocaine and 
about 1 pounds of marijuana about 480 citations were given 
including one for drunken driving 
darien cedric wright 23 of jacksonville fla was being held 
without bail friday after being arrested on drug trafficking 
charges about eight miles north of cocoa beach fla troopers said 
they found two kilograms of cocaine and 263 grams of crack cocaine 
in his car 
the drugs found in wrights car had an estimated street value of 
62500 
maybe this will have an adverse effect on criminals using our 
highways said florida highway patrol lt randy brown 
police in maryland seized 234 grams of marijuana 667 grams of 
cocaine and 890 in currency thirtysix motorists were arrested 
including one for a stolen vehicle and four on fugitive warrants

market scandal that forced the closing of six brokerages 
camoes was forced to resign as president of the central bank 
brazils equivalent of the us federal reserve when the brokerage 
firm he owned was accused in the speculation scandal 
in his threepage statement diefenthaeler said nahas and camoes 
should be arrested to prevent the possibility of them committing 
similar acts in the market through other investors 
the dimension of the problem would leave the law in danger

worth 31 million to pay for highly speculative deals on the rio de 
janeiro stock exchange 
the stock markets went into a tailspin andthe government ordered 
them shut on june 12 to avoid further panic the government also 
barred nahas from leaving the country the markest reopened the 
next day 
six brokerages involved in the scandal were closed and camoes 
resigned days later 
on june 26 the federal police charged nahas with two counts of 
whitecollar crime police said he tried to take 20000 illegally 
to london in 1987 and borrowed 12 million in 1983 from a bank of

relying on basic analysis of companies 
financial markets and the economy wright investors service sent 
several sharp warnings to its clients several weeks before the 
crash of october 1987 
the substance of those messages was the same that the stock 
market was grossly overpriced had been for many weeks and was 
destined to fall soon and sharply within a few weeks came the 
biggest shakeout in history 
now wright is issuing warnings again the international firm 
based in bridgeport conn says prices may have overshot their 
marks 
the new warnings dont have the urgency of those made in 1987 
instead of flashing red you might say they are a steady amber 
but the sugggestion is there if prices continue to rise the 
signals might turn red again 
its forecast while nowhere near as excessively priced today 
as two summers ago stocks are clearly still overvalued in light of 
current bond yields and uncertain prospects for the nearterm 
economy and profits 
consequently it adds stock prices may weaken during the second 
half of 1989 while bond market values increase 
among the basic tools used by wright in such analyses are 
priceearnings ratios priceequity ratios dividend yields bond 
yields and the prospect for corporate earnings the analyses 
contain little that is subjective 
priceearnings rising stock prices and the prospect of lower 
corporate profits in the quarters ahead have caused the 
priceearnings ratio of the standard amp poors 500stock index to 
rise to 131 from 107 earlier in 1989 
those ratios are based on earnings expected for the 12 months to 
come and could be affected by unexpectedly higher profits but 
based on reasonable expectations the pe is now above its 20year 
average of about 11 although still well below the multiple of 16 
times earnings in august 1987 
priceequity from 19 times shareholder equity at book value 
when the year began the sampp 500 has moved up to a multiple of 21 
over the past 20 years the norm has been 15 indicating a 
substantial overvaluation 
dividend yield it is declining the current 32 percent 
dividend yield on the sampp 500 compares with 35 percent as the year 
began and with 41 percent averaged over the past 20 years 
in other words the sampp 500 is now priced at 32 times current 
dividends onequarter higher than its average multiple of 25 
during the past two decades obviously says wright dividends are 
giving little support to prices 
bond yields the spread between bond yields and the yield of 
stock earnings has become more unfavorable for equities a 
consequence of rising stock prices and a slight deterioration in 
the outlook for corporate profits 
as the year began the difference was 04 percent in favor of 
stocks a spread that compares favorably with the average for the 
past 20 years today the spread is in favor of bonds even though 
fixed income yields have fallen 
to move the relationship back to normal says wright will 
require a combination of lower stock prices higher corporate 
profits and lower bond yields fortunately it adds interest rates 
are likely to continue to fall 
in short not an alarming situation but one that prudent 
investors should keep in mind as the dow jones industrial average 
comes within 90 percent of its alltime high of 2722 points just 
before the crash of 1987

time inc and warner communications inc expect 
to win their takeover fight with paramount communications inc and 
merge as planned but its not certain the combination will shield 
them from another hostile bid 
time and paramount officials have said the sheer size of the 
merged company time warner inc would not protect it from attack 
but securities analysts say potential bidders likely would be 
discouraged by the enormous debt that will burden time after the 
deal 
the delaware supreme court was scheduled to hear arguments 
monday in paramounts appeal of a lower court ruling allowing the 
timewarner deal to proceed 
legal scholars analysts and investors generally expected the 
states highest court to uphold the july 14 decision that said 
paramount and time shareholders have no right to block the merger 
that decision has been widely viewed as an important affirmation 
of a companys right to shape its longterm business strategy 
regardless of what shareholders want 
the delaware supreme courts ruling could come right after the 
hearing that would allow time to complete its 14 billion tender 
offer for warner as scheduled at 5 pm edt monday 
delaware has jurisdiction in the case because like most major 
us companies time warner and paramount all are incorporated in 
the tiny state which historically has offered low taxes and 
liberal business laws 
paramount said prior to the hearing that the timewarner deal 
would thwart any rival bidders even those willing to pay 200 a 
share the amount paramount has offered for time 
that of course includes us paramount stated 
but in testimony in the court battle in delaware paramount 
chairman martin davis time president nj nicholas jr and time 
vice chairman jerry levin among others said time would not be 
totally secure after acquiring warner 
some observers believe that despite paramounts protests the 
company may be considering an offer for time warner in the future 
others doubt anyone will make a run at time warner at least not 
immediately 
theoretically they are open to attack but practically i 
think it would be difficult said fred anschel an analyst with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
painewebber inc analyst j kendrick noble said the magnitude of 
the time warner marriage and the resulting debt that time will 
occur make the possibility of a takeover highly remote 
theories have been floated around wall street that someone could 
bid for time warner then pare unwanted assets to defray the costs 
of the transaction in the strategy commonly known as the leveraged 
buyout 
but theres a big drawback to that idea any asset sales would 
give an acquirer a big tax bill that would eat into the proceeds 
a raider probably would not get his money back noble said 
published reports last week said time and warner were themselves 
considering the sale of some assets including times scott 
foresman amp co a book publisher to help finance their merger 
we have not publicly revealed what assets if any the combined 
companies will sell said time spokesman edward adler calling 
the reports of possible sales hypothetical strategies 
how much it would cost to buy time warner depends ultimately on 
how much cash time pays for warner time will pay 70 per share in 
cash for half of warners 200 million outstanding shares in the 
tender offer scheduled to expire monday and 70 in a combination 
of cash and securities for the remaining shares in what is called 
the deals back end 
time says it does not expect to announce how much cash and 
securities the back end will contain or whether time will have to 
issue new common stock until some time perhaps several months 
after the tender offer expires that means the exact cost of the 
merger and the amount of time warners debt is yet to be determined 
but the cost of a time warner buyout would be stratospheric and 
will almost certainly require a combination of parties including 
possibly an lbo type of firm anschel said 
he projected the time warner debt at 11 billion to 12 billion 
a bid matching paramounts 200 a share offer would cost 122 
billion and could go higher 
between the cost of the shares and the debt youre talking 
25 billion anschel said 
there is still the problem of servicing that debt after a buyout 
is accomplished 
im not sure its too likely near term anschel said of a 
time warner bid 
ever since time and warner announced plans to merge last march 
wall street expected someone to make a pitch for one or both firms 
and after paramount launched its bid june 6 rumors flew about a 
bid for that company too 
no other bidders have emerged but some observers are waiting to 
see what might happen after delawares court rules

having heard what they wanted to hear from 
chairman alan greenspan of the federal reserve wall streeters now 
have begun to ask whats next 
as expected greenspan testified in his regular midyear 
appearance before a congressional committee this past week that the 
fed had shifted its sights in the past few months 
the central bank is less concerned now about inflationary 
pressures he said and has grown more watchful about the risk of 
an unnecessary and destructive recession 
that effectively made it official that the fed had begun in 
recent weeks to relax its credit policy encouraging interest rates 
to decline in an effort to cushion the effects of a slowing economy 
on businesses workers and consumers 
with added evidence to support their hopes for a soft 
landing stock traders responded enthusiastically bidding prices 
up their highest levels of the year 
indeed some broad measures of market trends briefly surpassed 
the peaks they reached nearly two years ago before the crash of 
october 1987 
but the positive reaction didnt last long by the end of the 
session on thursday a few hours after greenspans remarks both 
stocks and bonds had given up just about all their morning gains 
on friday both markets turned in another inconclusive showing 
while they applauded much of what he said analysts in the 
financial world noted that all of greenspans comments werent 
absolute positives for the investment outlook 
for one thing much of what he put into words had been signaled 
weeks before by the feds actions in the money markets and 
greenspan was vague on whether rates would fall further from here 
for another greenspan cautioned that the fed had set itself a 
tricky mission in the course of which it just might wind up 
worsening rather than solving the problems it was seeking to tame 
i cannot rule out a policy mistake as the trigger for a 
downturn he said we at the federal reserve might fail to 
restrain a speculative surge in the economy or fail to recognize 
that we were holding reserves too tight for too long 
nevertheless the stock market rang up its third straight weekly 
gain the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 5254 to 
260736 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 209 to 
18715 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 039 to 44929 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 316 at 37128 
volume on the big board averaged 17590 million shares a day 
against 16026 million the week before 
the idea as suggested by greenspan that the fed is neither 
allpowerful nor infallible isnt exactly new 
but it is often ignored or dismissed by commentators many of 
them critics who contend that the fed has too much power and too 
few people it must answer to in the course of conducting its 
business 
in the world of the late 1980s james grant editor of the 
newsletter grants interest rate observer leans toward the view 
that the feds influence is limited by international flows of money 
and credit or liquidity 
if the federal reserve is tight as its been for a year or 
more why is the stock market high grant said why is there 
so much bank credit for so many zany transactions why are so many 
people having so much fun 
perhaps liquidity is not a single gurgling brook but a mighty 
river with many tributaries perhaps the fed is only one of these 
sources 
liquidity is international and psychological more than 
domestic and tangible it is the predisposition of debtors to 
borrow and of creditors to lend

only a few years ago californias bank of 
america seemed to be sliding into the slurpy swamp of bad debt 
while across the country the bank of new england thrived on a 
thundering economy and demand for new loans 
as most in the banking industry well know times can change 
rather suddenly in a business predicated on the fluctuating cost of 
money and the assumption that borrowers will prosper and promptly 
repay what they owe 
quarterly earnings released this past week by big us banks 
reflected a remarkable resurgence at bankamerica corp the 
nations secondlargest banking company and an equally remarkable 
rout at bank of new england corp no 17 
the bank earnings reports also graphically illustrated how the 
american economy is a hodgepodge of regions some marked by strong 
expansion others by rising unemployment and slumping markets for 
goods services and property 
bankamerica earned 304 million or 150 a share in the three 
months ended june 30 up 877 percent from 162 million or 85 cents 
a share earned a year earlier 
it was the third straight quarter of company record results and 
exceeded expectations of many securities analysts who only a few 
years back were railing against bankamerica for its huge loan 
losses and seemingly unending flow of red ink 
they attributed the resurgence to the companys efforts to 
control costs and reduce a big exposure to unpaid third world loans 
and other forms of delinquent or bad debts 
bankamerica chairman a w clausen said the banks performance 
also was helped by an expansion of domestic loans and deposits 
especially among consumers and homebuyers a signal of the buoyant 
economy in california and washington where the bank operates 
extensively 
the story was drastically different at bank of new england 
which only a few years ago was aggressively granting loans to 
residents and businesses basking in prosperity of what was one of 
the fastest growing regions 
bank of new england reported a 47 percent drop in secondquarter 
earnings because of unpaid debts and a squeeze on its interest rate 
margins thats the difference between the interest a bank makes on 
its own investments and the rate it pays on deposits 
the bank earned 365 million or 52 cents a share in the three 
months ended june 30 vs 692 million or 1 a share a year 
earlier banking analysts called it dramatic evidence of the 
decline in the new england economy 
in other business and economic news this past week 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan disclosed he expects 
the economy to slow in coming months but a recession isnt likely 
signaling that the central bank is prepared to ease interest rates 
further because it views inflation as a lessening threat 
greenspans testimony at his twiceyearly report to congress 
was partly substantiated by government statistics june consumer 
prices fell 02 percent the smallest gain in 16 months june 
wholesale prices fell 01 percent and reports on retail sales 
industrial output and factory use also suggested economic growth is 
slowing but in a sign that the economy remains strong the may 
trade deficit swelled to 1024 billion the worst showing in five 
months 
there were more dramatic maneuvers in the corporate takeover 
business the threeway battle for media giant time inc headed to 
a hearing in delawares highest court dow chemical co agreed to 
acquire a majority stake in pharmaceutical maker marion 
laboratories inc for more than 2 billion and gillette co a 
veteran of two hostile acquisition attempts sold a 600 million 
stake to multibillionaire investor warren buffett as a defensive 
step 
eastern airlines took a major step in trying to resurrect 
itself from a crippling fourmonthold strike and the refuge of 
bankruptcy court eastern filed a reorganization plan detailing how 
it plans to sell assets pay all debts and emerge as a smaller but

eastern airlines major creditors have expressed 
support for the carriers proposed reorganization plan which would 
give full repayment to creditors and to consumers holding tickets 
canceled by the strike 
eastern filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan late friday 
the plan provides that all easterns debts including outstanding 
tickets totaling around 33 billion would be paid in full with 
interest mostly through cash payments 
consumers would have the option of either a cash refund or other 
options such as tickets for other flights 
the committee representing easterns major creditors in its 
bankruptcy case said in a statement it supports easterns plan of 
reorganization filed today with the bankruptcy court 
the committee is encouraged that the company has been meeting 
its business plan and the committee will continue to monitor 
operations through the rampup period the creditors statement 
read the committee looks forward to continued progress in the 
case and to the emergence of eastern from chapter 11 as a 
successfully reorganized airline 
adam harris an attorney for the creditors committee said the 
creditors would continue to support easterns proposal so long as 
the airlines operating goals were met 
but easterns pilots union warned that the airline still was 
far removed from securing bankruptcy court approval of its 
plan the union noted that among other steps eastern still must 
negotiate with the creditors over specific elements of the 
proposal which centers on a restructuring of the company as a 
smaller more efficient carrier 
friday was the scheduled end of easterns exclusive period for 
filing a bankruptcy reorganization plan the strikebound company 
was not required to seek creditor approval before filing the plan 
but apparently did so to try to bolster overall support for the 
proposal which also must be approved by us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland 
eastern has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors since march 9 five days after the start of a crippling 
strike against the miamibased carrier the detailed reorganization 
plan outlines how eastern plans to emerge from bankruptcy at about 
twothirds its prestrike size 
the airline wants to pay creditors with the proceeds of about 
18 billion in asset sales including sales totaling 650 million 
that already have been approved by the us bankruptcy court 
some of easterns biggest creditors and the amounts they are 
owed are european aircraft manufacturer airbus industrie 9594 
million general electric co 7547 million aircraft maker 
boeing co 5398 million united technologies credit corp 
2230 million rollsroyce credit corp 589 million and hotel 
giant marriott corp 105 million 
the scheduled expiration of easterns exclusivity period during 
which other parties to the case cannot file reorganization 
proposals under bankruptcy law was midnight edt friday 
lifland agreed early this month to a joint request by eastern 
and major creditors to extend the exclusivity period for two weeks 
through july 21 after they indicated they were nearing agreement 
on a restructuring plan 
submission of a reorganization plan during the exclusivity 
period automatically gives a chapter 11 company 60 days more to 
seek creditors approval under bankruptcy law competing plans may 
not be filed during that period 
easterns plan assumes that its latin american routes would be 
sold for up to 375 million sources close to the situation said 
friday they said eastern has been in negotiations with american 
airlines for such a sale 
a memo earlier this week from eastern senior vice president tom 
matthews to the air line pilots association said the route sale 
idea would be scrapped if the company reached a contract agreement 
with the striking pilots 
marathon talks between representatives of eastern and the pilots 
union mediated by bankruptcy examiner david i shapiro continued 
friday near tampa fla with no signs of progress a source close 
to the negotiations said 
on thursday lifland approved the release of 75 million raised 
by asset sales to eastern the airline initially asked for the 
release of 100 million from its major creditors while a committee 
representing the creditors asked that only 40 million be released 
however the parties agreed to the 75 million figure and the 
judge approved it with the understanding eastern could request 
additional money from the escrow fund which contains 352 million 
from the sales of eastern assets
