the leftist government and usbacked 
rebels ended a second day of ceasefire talks late wednesday 
softening earlier statements that disagreements were threatening 
the negotiations 
we discussed some substantial issues rebel spokesman bosco 
matamoros said at the end of the daylong talks asked if advances 
had been made he replied i didnt say that 
manuel espinoza the sandinista governments information 
minister told reporters after the talks ended that the rebels 
recognized advances had been made 
espinoza had painted a rosy picture of tuesdays talks only to 
have his remarks disputed by the rebels by midday wednesday both 
sides acknowledged problems 
it has deterioriated but it is preplanned on the part of the 
reagan administration and the contras deputy foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco told journalists 
he said there was a conspiracy to rupture the talks and 
blame the breakdown on the sandinista government 
the rebels known as contras accused the sandinistas of being 
evasive about when promised democratic reforms would be enacted 
meanwhile police briefly detained 14 of about 30 members of 
opposition political parties who held a march in downtown managua 
the interior ministry said tinoco described the march as a 
provocation and violation of the law 
the contras said no further talks on details of the ceasefire 
plan signed march 23 would be held unless there is agreement in the 
current fourth round of talks 
about the contra charge of evasiveness on democratic reform 
paul reichler a us lawyer negotiating for the sandinistas said 
thats simply a lie and i wont be diplomatic about it 
he said the contras were engaging in tactics to make it 
appear the sandinistas were unwilling to compromise and then to 
seek us military aid 
on tuesday both sides reported headway on a government pledge 
of democratic reforms including freedom of the press political 
liberties an end to sandinista party control of the army the 
right to strike and changes in the electoral system 
contra delegate roberto ferrey said wednesday however it is 
not possible to continue a process in which one of the parts the 
sandinista front has demonstrated that it does not have the 
minimum desire to really seek a peaceful solution to the nicaraguan 
crisis 
tension and mistrust have marked all the talks on ending the 
war which has lasted nearly seven years and taken almost 27000 
lives among the main snags are how to define democracy and the 
timetable and mechanics of disarmament 
espinoza said wednesday the government agreed to a contra 
request that humanitarian aid be delivered to the rebels in safe 
areas by the pan american development foundation an agency of the 
organization of american states 
under the march 23 ceasefire agreement aid can be delivered 
after an independent verification commission certifies the rebels 
have moved into seven designated zones representatives of the 
roman catholic church and oas make up the commission 
espinoza said the government was sticking to its demand that the 
rebel disarmament and return to civilian life be completed by the 
end of september but the contras want that extended until the end 
of january 
reichler claimed the contra timetable was linked to the us 
election and inauguration of a new president to preserve a 
military option he called it one last role of the dice on a 
bush victory referring to vice president george bush the likely 
republican nominee 
the demonstration wednesday was called to protest a law that has 
enabled the sandinistats to close radio stations for broadcasting 
what the government declares to be misingformation or unconfirmed 
news about the war or military draft 
among those detained were erick ramirez president of the social 
christian party

countries overseeing antarctica 
have overruled environmentalist objections and recommended mineral 
exploitation of the frozen continent thought to be rich in gold 
oil coal and other resources 
delegates agreed at the monthlong conference that ended last week 
to lift a ban on development of antarctica the 100page document 
called the antarctic minerals convention also expressed concern for 
the antarctic environment and contained provisions for its 
protection 
chris beeby new zealands deputy secretary of foreign affairs 
and chairman of the 20nation group which approved the document 
thursday said it offered the strongest protection possible for the 
unspoiled antarctic environment 
however greenpeace and other nongovernmental groups included in 
the discussions claimed they were inadequate 
the conventions provisions include creating an antarctic 
minerals resource commission to oversee the regions development 
the united states which was represented at the meeting 
estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleum 
reserves 
the convention also contains provisions for cleanup operations 
where necessary must now be ratified by a minimum of 16 of the 
antarctic treatys 20 members including the seven which have land 
claims in antarctica 
beeby predicted the convention will go down in antarctic 
history as the most important political development regarding the 
regulation of antarctica since the antarctic treaty itself was 
adopted in 1959 
conservationists who pushed to have the region protected as a 
world park disagreed 
greenpeace spokesman roger wilson said the agreement was reached 
only by bludgeoning environmentally minded nations into 
submission 
wilson said the convention looked good on paper but would not 
protect the environment in practice 
beeby said he did not think exploitation of resources will begin 
soon 
a moratorium on mineral development has existed since 1977 and 
will remain until the convention is ratified delegates said 
antarctica is double the size of the united states countries 
with land claims are australia britain new zealand chile norway 
argentina and france

avantgarde artists armed with video cameras 
rather than paint brushes are creating electronic works of art 
designed to draw the viewer into the picture 
people are captivated by this art form said video artist 
mary lucier it screens out distractions it draws you into a 
completely new and different world in that sense its kind of 
like going to the movies 
a new exhibit american landscape video the electronic 
grove features work done in the past decade by seven leading 
video artists including lucier 
the show on display through july 10 at pittsburghs carnegie 
museum of art features bright moving images that appear on video 
monitors illuminating darkened rooms 
the videotapes show waves crashing against icebergs as birds 
call a green palm rustling in the wind and a forest fire raging 
amid crackles and pops eerie music plays as the camera peers up 
the face of a gray cliff and then focuses on rippling water 
the artists placed rocks trees and other objects around the 
video monitors which have screens up to 25 inches wide in one 
work viewers can turn away from the screens and see their own 
images in the still water of a reflecting pool in another a coil 
periodically emits a deafening electrical charge that prompts 
adults to cover their ears and schoolchildren to scream 
each space creates its own environment lucier says the 
impact i think is greater than sculpture there is the sound as 
well as moving images and three dimensional objects 
many people resist the concept of video art assuming viewing it 
would be like watching television but they usually like the works 
once they see them said bill judson film curator at the carnegie 
people come in and they see this and they say my god i love 
that he said theyre astonished in themselves 
video art began in the mid1960s when advances in technology 
made black and white film equipment more affordable in the early 
70s museums began showing elaborate video displays and some 
artists used color computergenerated images in their work 
in new york the metropolitan museum of art and the whitney 
museum of american art have displayed video works but many smaller 
museums cant afford the high cost of building the exhibits judson 
said 
theres a lot of great work being done but its just not 
getting exposure he said 
in luciers wilderness three videotapes are shown 
simultaneously on seven monitors placed on white pedestals she 
filmed the same sites depicted by 19th century american landscape 
artists such as thomas cole and frederic church showing gleaming 
icebergs against a backdrop of clear sky 
one work room for st john on the cross has a gyrating 
image of mountain tops projected on a large sreen in the center of 
the room is a small cube with light streaming from a single window 
a voice reciting in spanish can be heard and a whitecapped 
mountain is shown on a small video monitor inside the cube 
artist bill viola said the work is based on a spanish mystic who 
wrote love poetry and dreamed of flying over mountains despite 
being confined and tortured for nine months in a cell 
doug halls the terrible uncertainty of the thing described 
features six monitors and a large screen that show a roaring fire 
tornadoes whirling and storms at sea within the gallery a steel 
fence encloses the coil that fires an electrical discharge at two 
oversized stainless steel highbacked chairs

sky 
frank gillette placed eight eyelevel monitors in a square 
showing reeds in a marsh birds flying and other wildlife in the 
wilderness north of corpus christi texas

the auspicious date rolls around only once a 
century 8888 and it has numberconscious couples in singapore 
flocking to get married on that day 
engaged couples have already booked all 90 available slots at 
the registry of marriages on aug 8 the registry has had to put up 
a sign telling couples it has no more openings 
those being turned away have the option of joining more than 100 
other couples in mass nuptials at a theaterrestaurant that will be 
staffed by registry officials 
at least four hotels and six restaurants are fully booked for 
chinese wedding dinners on monday aug 8 
the date is auspicious because cantonesespeaking chinese 
pronounce the number eight paat which sounds like faat 
which means prosperity 
hence the belief that a date made up of all eights bodes well 
for the future 
many of those who cant marry on aug 8 seek propitious 
alternatives 
the registry of marriages which usually averages 43 marriages a 
day reports that aug 1 and 2 are proving popular as second 
choices 
the local usage of numerical dates places the day first followed 
by month and year so aug 1 appears 1888 it is pronounced yat 
paat paat paat which sounds like once prosperous always 
prosperous 
aug 2 or 2888 is pronounced yee paat paat paat easy 
to be prosperous 
some of the betrothed want to cover two special dates they plan 
to marry on aug 8 but delay the wedding dinner until sept 18 
which in the lunar year coincides with the eighth day of the 
eighth moon 
sept 18 was fully booked in november last year said 
jessica eng of the cathay restaurant 
millions in singapore hong kong taiwan malaysia and other 
parts of asia hold a deep respect for what they perceive as the 
power of certain numbers particularly older people whose beliefs 
are strongly influenced by the traditions of china 
while 13 is unlucky to westerners the number four alone or in 
a combination such as 24 or 44 is bad news for many chinese 
because in cantonese it sounds like the word for dying 
numbers affect many things municipal officials say they receive 
about 10 written and many oral requests each year from people who 
want to change house numbers because the ones they have are unlucky 
applicants get a standard reply no change is possible as this 
will result in a haphazard system abuse and impropriety 
real estate agents say that if chinese have a choice when buying 
or renting property they generally shun houses or apartments with 
the number four some developers offer discounts when selling 
condominiums with unlucky numbers especially if the market is 
sluggish 
the auctioning of license plates with lucky numbers fetched the 
equivalent of about 1 million in singapore dollars in the last 
three years for the registry of vehicles plates with multiple 
number eights are special favorites 
if aug 8 1988 was not auspicious enough this is also the year 
of the dragon in the chinese astrological cycle following a rabbit 
year in the 12year zodiac the dragon is considered a mighty 
creature that bestows blessings 
a spokesman for the population planning unit said it expects an 
increase in births this year children who will be known as dragon 
seeds 
not everyone agrees that popular dates have much to do with 
custom or traditional belief 
the couples have departed completely from the chinese almanac 
in choosing these dates said lee siow mong a retired educator 
and president of the china society the traditional way is to 
pick the proper date and time according to the almanac 
personally i think all this talk about 8888 being lucky is 
very stupid and baseless lee said in an interview with the 
straits times newspaper 
nevertheless maggie tay who was told that all the registry of 
marriage slots were taken on aug 8 still wants to go by the 
numbers 
it is a special day that comes along only once in a hundred 
years she said adding that she was considering new years day 
as an alternative 
yat yat paat kow 1189 sounds like everyday prosper 
forever

the house of commons has voted by a wide margin 
against restoring the death penalty which was officially abolished 
in britain in 1969 
by a 341 to 218 vote tuesday night lawmakers defeated a 
resolution that would have empowered juries to recommend capital 
punishment for any crime 
it was the eighth failure to reinstate the death penalty in 19 
years most previous attempts have called for execution for 
specific crimes including murder 
all parties in the 650member commons allowed their members a 
free vote and loud cheers filled the packed chamber when the 
result was announced after a 4hour debate 
roger gale a member of prime minister margaret thatchers 
governing conservative party who launched this bid to restore the 
death penalty argued that it would deter wouldbe murderers 
if the proposed measure were to have saved one life that 
would be worth the risk gale said i do not seek vengeance i 
do not seek punishment i seek solely a deterrent 
but home secretary douglas hurd criticized death penalty 
advocates who take a remarkably broad brush approach to a power 
of life and death 
the way to deal with violent crime is by strengthening the 
police stiffening sentences building prisons and equally 
important by reinforcing the selfconfidence of all those who 
influence or should influence the young in this country away from 
violence he said 
mrs thatcher voted in favor of the measure 
the drive to reinstate the death penalty received momentum from 
a february newspaper survey showing that 43 of the 53 conservative 
members of parliament elected for the first time one year ago favor 
the return of hanging the traditional british form of execution 
for premeditated murder

gov michael dukakis drew reagan democrats back 
to the fold in the california and new jersey primaries tuesday 
garnering support from a voting group whose choice will be critical 
in the general election 
about a quarter of the voters in the two primaries said they had 
backed president reagan in 1984 and nearly twothirds of them said 
this year they would favor dukakis over george bush cbs newsnew 
york times polls said 
a los angeles times exit poll of republicans in california 
contained other good news for dukakis only about a third of the 
republican voters viewed him unfavorably far fewer than usual for a 
candidate of the opposing party 
also a sizable share of democratic opponent jesse jacksons 
voters viewed dukakis favorably an indication that dukakis will be 
able to win them over with relative ease said los angeles times 
pollster ia lewis 
in the 1984 and 1980 democratic primaries in california 
supporters of the losers were far more antagonistic toward the 
winners lewis noted jackson voters are not unfavorable to 
dukakis he said so it wont be so hard for them to bind up 
their wounds 
on the other side of the country exit polls of new jersey voters 
said more democrats considered dukakis to be a strong and 
experienced leader than in earlier contests and more said they 
supported him strongly 
his strength of support was not as great in california according 
to preliminary poll results but dukakis voters still valued his 
experience and leadership more than generally was the case in 
earlier races 
the polls in california indicated that dukakis and jackson split 
the liberal vote a large segment of the democratic electorate 
there while dukakis won among moderates and conservative democrats 
the polls said jackson won about a quarter of the white vote in 
california one of his best showings among whites but only 9 
percent in new jersey one of his worst showings with whites he got 
more than 90 percent of the black vote in both states 
abc news poll results from new jersey said dukakis continued to 
appeal to democrats across the ideological spectrum he won 
majorities of liberals moderates and conservatives and 56 percent 
of all democrats said his views were just about right as opposed 
to too liberal or too conservative 
in both california and new jersey about a quarter of democratic 
voters said they were not sure of dukakis ideology less than in 
earlier races but still an indication he was somewhat illdefined 
said john brennan an abc poll analyst still brennan noted small 
minorities of voters thought dukakis too liberal or too conservative 
that broad ideological appeal could be doubleedged brennan 
said its an indication hes run a moderate campaign it also 
indicates people havent scrutinized him closely hes all things to 
all people 
the cbstimes poll found that 54 percent of the dukakis voters in 
new jersey supported him strongly up from most earlier races when 
asked the most important qualities they considered 43 percent said 
experience and 41 percent cited strong leadership also increases 
from earlier contests 
in california roughly half of the dukakis voters had some 
reservations about him and fewer said they were strongly for him 
still experience and strong leadership were most often cited as 
reasons for backing him 
the strength of dukakis support in new jersey could stem from 
the fact that hes on a roll hes got momentum from a string of 
primary victories said cbs news poll analyst keating holland it 
also could reflect a regional bias for a fellow northeasterner he 
said 
although the electorate was racially polarized 70 percent of 
jacksons new jersey supporters told abc they would vote for dukakis 
over bush in november while just 7 percent took bush and 22 percent 
said they would not vote and while most jackson voters wanted him 
to be the vice presidential nominee a slight majority in new 
jersey 54 percent said the choice should be left up to the 
presidential nominee abc reported 
abcs polls had a margin of sampling error of five percentage 
points the cbstimes poll had a fourpoint margin nbcs 2 points

its an unproven legend that betsy ross made 
the nations first official flag but there was little disbelief 
among children at her house to start the celebration of the 211th 
anniversary of the flags adoption by congress 
a 22by45foot replica of the 13star flag was unfurled tuesday 
down the side of a building as 30 schoolchildren watched waving 
smaller versions of the flag 
just who was betsy ross 
she was the one that made the first american flag said paul 
sherlock 11 from st charles borromeo school in cinnaminson nj 
by making the first american flag she was like the first real 
american said classmate matthew kozlowski 11 
ross has received popular credit as the seamstress who made the 
13star flag that was adopted by the continental congress on june 
14 1777 the anniversary will be celebrated with a ceremony next 
tuesday flag day in front of the house in which mrs ross 
supposedly sewed the banner 
william kingsley director of the house near independence hall 
feels there is enough evidence to give ross credit for the flag in 
any case he said she remains an important woman in the nations 
history 
we know she made flags for the pennsylvania navy and musket 
balls for the continental army she was involved in the life of her 
country kingsley said i think if you took away the incident 
of the flag shed still be worth knowing 
kingsley said the huge flag was made three years ago in the 
courtyard of the house by employees of humphrys flag co located 
across the street 
on monday greg scott a descendant of mrs ross will 
participate in a wreathlaying ceremony at the tomb of mrs ross 
and her third husband john claypoole at a park next to the house

regulators complied with congress intent when 
they sought to spare the automotive industry economic hardship by 
lowering fueleconomy standards a federal appeals court says 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued 
that ruling tuesday in turning down a petition attacking the lower 
1986 standards the petition was filed by the state of california 
the cities of new york and los angeles and four public issues 
groups 
the national highway traffic safety administrations 
consideration of the likelihood of economic hardship within its 
assessment of economic practicability must be given due weight 
the court said in an opinion by judge ruth ginsburg 
the agencys decision was based on an analysis that concluded 
the higher standard would have severe economic effects throughout 
the auto industry and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious as 
the petitioners alleged the court said 
nhtsa lowered the corporate average fuel economy or cafe 
standard automakers must meet in 1986 from the 275 mpg set by 
congress to 26 mpg standards for 1987 and 1988 were also lowered 
to 26 mpg 
petitions also have been filed asking for review of the 1987 and 
1988 standards con hitchcock an attorney for the public issues 
groups said they would reevaluate the petitions for 1987 and 1988 
in light of the courts ruling 
although congress set the standard at the higher level it also 
allowed nhtsa to set lower standards after considering economic 
practicality technological feasibility the effect of other motor 
vehicle standards and the nations need to conserve energy 
the court rejected the petitioners assertion that nhtsa failed 
to consider energy conservation in adopting the lower standards 
the agency had weighed increased fuel consumption against 
economic harm under broad guidelines set by congress 
had congress offered a more precise balancing formula for the 
agency to apply we could more confidently discern the agencys 
compliance with the congressional mandate the court said 
lacking precise standards nhtsa properly accommodated 
conflicting policies in lowering the standard the court said 
judge abner mikva joined judge ginsbug in the majority judge 
lawrence silberman dissented in part 
public issues groups joining in the petition were public 
citizen the center for auto safety the union of concerned 
scientists and the environmental policy institute

the environmental protection agency says it 
will be safe to test a banned termitekiller in houses and other 
occupied dwellings even though an environmental groups calls it 
using humans as guinea pigs 
we dont see it as human testing says james roelofs epas 
review manager for chlordane a widely used chemical that epa says 
could pose longterm health risks including cancer 
roelofs made the statement tuesday after a watchdog group 
criticized an epaapproved plan calling for at least 150 residences 
around the nation to be treated with the chemical 
this amounts to epasanctioned human testing of a pesticide 
said jay feldman national coordinator of the national coalition 
against the misuse of pesticides 
under the plan chlordane would be applied at unidentified test 
sites at no cost to homeowners air inside the homes would be 
monitored for two years to detect any levels of chlordane 
chlordane was used for 40 years to termiteproof an estimated 30 
million dwellings but sale of chlordane for residential 
applications was halted last august under an agreement between epa 
and velsicol chemical corp the illinoisbased manufacturer of the 
pesticide 
epa said detectable levels of chlordane inside houses raised 
concerns that longterm exposure to low levels of chlordane could 
pose health risks including an increased risk of developing 
cancer 
the agreement halted chlordane sales by velsicol until the 
company could conduct further testing and show that no home 
involved in the new study had detectable levels of chlordane in its 
indoor air 
roelofs said the new tests will involve application methods that 
are different from the traditional ways chlordane was applied 
the chemical will be placed in the ground around a house or 
under a concrete slab foundation rather than being injected into 
the concrete itself according to roelofs 
there may be an element of risk to the inhabitants but we 
have reason to believe its low roelofs said by eliminating 
pressure injections and any injection inside the house its 
possible there wont be any detectable levels its a reasonable 
expectation 
roelofs said epa and velsicol wont know whether the new 
application methods produce indoor levels of chlordane until 
theres been some testing 
he said the airmonitoring tests could be conducted at 
unoccupied dwellings but that this was not proposed by either epa 
or velsicol 
we think its within reason that if you dont put the material 
in the house it wont get into the house roelofs said 
theyre going to apply it in a way thats least likely to lead to 
exposure 
donna jennings velsicols public affairs manager said the 
company did not consider using unoccupied dwellings because 
theres no evidence to say chlordane is a human health hazard 
she said velsicol reached the agreement with epa rather than 
face the drawnout negative publicity that could accompany 
fighting a formal epa regulatory move against chlordane 
roelofs said the agency acted against chlordane because we 
were being very conservative about the results of earlier tests 
showing the chemical leached into indoor air 
jennings said the new testing wont begin until the company and 
epa settle the issue of whether the names of the participating 
homeowners will be kept secret 
we dont want them harassed she said 
feldman says his organization wants the test locations made 
public so that we can notify potential participants of the 
hazards people participating in what amounts to a human 
testing experiment will receive no neutral objective information 
he said the information epa wants velsicol to give participants 
is weak and when taken together with the other material velsicol 
plans to circulate will leave potential participants in their 
study with a distorted view of the risks that they face

a sculptors plan to perch a statue of a 
barebreasted indian woman on a bluff sparked a debate over art 
sexism and whether bronze can be voluptuous 
art won 
though four members of the board of selectmen approved the 
placement of the statue high atop the hills overlooking onset bay 
the fifth opposed it last week 
selectman joseph grassia said he had concerns about the statue 
because it will be in a public place and visible to children who 
will see that she is fairly largebreasted 
some say art others will say nudity said grassia i 
wanted to see if its an attack on the female 
the sculptor a clayton e fuller said the statue represents 
the traditional wampanoag indian maiden in what would have been her 
traditional summer costume a triangular loincloth that drapes 
over one thigh 
wampanoags once called the onset area near wareham their summer 
home fuller told selectmen their numbers eventually dwindled 
because of famine he said 
i believe the piece is sufficiently discreet said fuller 
she does have on her necklace incidently 
most other town officials agreed 
if someone refers to that as sex something is wrong said 
selectman donald l carlson of fullers creation there are more 
explicit photos to be found in national geographic 
selectwoman sarah d woods said that although she received a 
letter from a woman who was opposed to the statues bare breasts 
she likes the sculpture and found it more handsomely beautiful 
than pretty

millions of workers would be exposed to 
smaller concentrations of toxic chemicals on the job under the 
first wholesale revision of federal occupational health regulations 
governing the hazards 
the occupational safety and health administration on tuesday 
proposed cutting job exposure limits for 234 toxic chemicals and 
bringing 168 others under government regulation for the first time 
this is a 20year technological leap that brings the countrys 
basic occupational health regulations up to date said osha 
administrator and assistant labor secretary john a pendergrass 
officials estimated that the new exposure ceilings will reduce 
jobrelated fatalities due to cancer respiratory and 
cardiovascular ailments and liver and kidney diseases by 500 a 
year illnesses will fall by an estimated 55000 annually they 
said 
approximately 36 million workers are now exposed to 
concentrations of the chemicals above the proposed new ceilings 
osha officials said they estimated the cost to industry of meeting 
the new standards at 900 million a year 
some of the most widely used chemicals for which exposure limits 
would be reduced are choloroform carbon monoxide hydrogen 
cyanide ammonia and trichlorethylene 
employers would have to meet the new standards six months after 
the final regulations are approved 
pendergrass said approval of the regulations could come as 
earlier as november but he acknowledged that business opposition 
to many of the changes is likely to surface in hearings scheduled 
to begin next month or through court challenges later 
osha officials said immediate compliance with most of the 
proposed standards could be achieved through the use of personal 
respirators however they added that the agency envisions 
requiring the adoption of more expensive engineering controls such 
as ventilation systems within four years 
pendergrass called the regulations the most significant 
workplace exposure action taken by osha in its 17year history 
union officials endorsed the goal but complained that the 
proposal requires no monitoring to assure that exposure ceilings 
are not exceeded they also noted that it excludes some toxic 
chemicals such as beryllium chromates and silica 
we generally supported the project but were disappointed 
said diane factor an industrial hygienist for the aflcio to 
have an exposure limit without a monitoring requirement is like 
ordering a 55 miles per hour speed limit without a speedometer 
ms factor said however it is unlikely that the aflcio would 
challenge the standards in court 
randy schumacher director of health and safety for the chemical 
manufacturers association said his group supports oshas approach 
but added he anticipates challenges from companies to some of the 
specific limits 
this is a good onetime approach but osha needs some kind of 
mechanism that allows this to occur on a more routine basis 
schumacher said 
the osha proposal sets exposure limits on a total of 428 
chemicals including the 234 for which the current ceilings would 
be dropped and the 168 coming under federal regulation for the 
first time 
current exposure limits would be reaffirmed for 25 more 
chemicals and a 10fold increase in the exposure limit would be 
allowed for one fluorine based on recent data the agency said 
osha has been criticized widely by both labor and management for 
not having updated its exposure ceilings since the agencys 
creation in 1971 its attempts on a substancebysubstance 
approach such as with asbestos and benzene have succeeded in only 
24 cases 
the agency estimates there are now more than 550000 potentially 
toxic chemicals and chemical compounds in the workplace 
most of the current federal exposure limits are based on 
threshold values established in 1968 by the american conference 
of governmental industrial hygienists and adopted in 1971 by osha 
as federal standards 
since then the acgih and the national institute for 
occupational safety and health have updated the threshold values or 
recommended exposure limits on many of the chemicals but the 
changes have not been reflected in osha regulations 
pendergrass said most of the proposed new ceilings are based on 
198788 data provided by the acgih with backup from niosh an 
agency of the department of health and human services 
nioshrecommended exposure limits are actually lower than the 
proposed new ceilings in many cases but unlike the acgih and osha 
niosh does not consider feasiblity in its recommendations on 
permissible exposures pendergrass said

the federal governments no 2 health official 
has selected 14 nurses for special recognition as a way to honor 
the thousands who care for aids patients 
in announcing his plans tuesday dr robert e windom the 
assistant health and human services secretary for health said 
nurses have been the unsung heroes of the aids epidemic 
he noted that physicians and research scientists unlike nurses 
frequently come to public attention 
windom and other federal officials asked the american journal of 
nursing and a number of local organizations to help select 
individuals to represent nurses who care for aids patients 
although both private and public health officials say health 
care workers who refuse to take care of aids patients are the 
exception they acknowledge that there are some nurses and others 
who try to avoid aids patients apparently for fear of catching 
the virus 
i feel very strongly that nurses who are giving selfless 
dedicated care to people with aids have not received the 
recognition they have merited windom said in a letter to the 14 
nurses 
windom said each of the 14 has accepted an invitation to an

president najib of afghanistan in his 
united nations debut threatened to seek a delay in the soviet troop 
withdrawal from his country if pakistan continues its vigorous 
support of anticommunist guerrillas 
najib also told a news conference tuesday that more than 34000 
soviet soldiers have left afghanistan since may 15 under a 
unmediated agreement calling for a complete red army pullout over 
nine months 
but najib said his marxist government could have the pace of 
withdrawal slowed if neighboring pakistan does not stop what he 
called interference in afghanistans internal affairs 
we want to visualize an optimistic situation he said but 
should such violations acquire a permanent character in such a 
case we would certainly renew our consideration on the schedule of 
withdrawal and take proper reactions together with the soviet 
union 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 more 
than 100000 had until last month helped friendly governments fight 
guerrillas backed by the united states pakistan and china 
the guerrillas have repudiated the settlement signed april 14 in 
geneva they reject najibs government refuse to join a coalition 
government and vow to continue fighting soviet and afghan army 
forces 
on tuesday western diplomats in pakistan said soviet troops are 
delaying their pullout from kandahar afghanistans second largest 
city which has been under siege by guerrillas 
najib asked about kandahar indicated developments there have 
not necessarily changed the withdrawal timetable to which he said 
his government is determined to adhere 
in a bid to win legitimacy for his embattled government najib 
delivered a 30minute speech in the dari language tuesday to a 
special general assembly session on disarmament 
pakistan boycotted the speech and the united states which does 
not recognize the kabul government sent a young foreign service 
intern instead of a ranking diplomat soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze and a highlevel soviet delegation attended 
asked about us arms and support for the rebels najib noted 
that the united states is a coguarantor of the geneva agreement 
we expect the usa as a great civilized and advanced 
country to guarantee this internationally prestigious agreement and 
not to destroy and spoil it he said 
in his speech najib said in violation of the accords camps 
and centers for training of the extremist afghan opposition still 
exist on the territory of pakistan huge amounts of arms are being 
transported for subversion and terrorist activities in afghanistan 
najib told reporters that after soviet troops withdraw if the 
interference from pakistan is totally stopped not only would the 
afghan armed forces resist but they would be able to give a rebuff 
to the extremist forces of the opposition 
he said he seeks a broad coalition government including afghans 
both within the nation and outside such a coalition would be viable 
even without participation of the sevenparty insurgents alliance 
which views the world through the barrel of a gun he said 
najib declined in answer to a question to say whether he might 
step down in an effort to achieve national reconciliation he said 
he had been elected by a traditional council of the afghan people 
najib called on the international community lending institutions 
and the united nations to contribute to economic reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of afghanistan 
afghanistans staterun radio kabul monitored in islamabad 
pakistan said prime minister mohammad hasan sharq announced his 
24member cabinet on tuesday 
sharq replaced sultan ali keshtmand on may 26 the time gap 
between his appointment and formation of a government fueled 
speculation that najib faced a deep split within the governing 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
najib is trying to hold together his parcham faction divided 
between loyalty to him and to former president babrak karmal 
sharqs cabinet returns sayed mohammad gulabzoi leader of the 
partys opposition khalq wing to the interior ministry diplomatic 
reports said najib has been trying to push gulabzoi out of the 
government

more than 1 billion in federal payments to 
farmers aimed at reducing milk surpluses merely caused a temporary 
leveling off of production according to a report from the general 
accounting office 
while the program contracted to remove almost 9 percent from 
annual milk production nonparticipating dairy farmers continued to 
increase their production says the report from the congressional 
investigative agency 
it said that in 1986 the first year of the dairy termination 
program or wholeherd buyout as it is sometimes called production 
actually increased by 234 pounds or a fraction of one percent of 
the 1985 level 
under the program farmers agreed to slaughter or export their 
entire herds and get out of dairying for at least five years in 
return for payments from the agriculture department the plan was 
incorporated into the 1985 legislation approved in response to 
painful stagnation that afflicted the farm economy at that time 
production dropped below the 1985 level by about half of one 
percent in 1987 according to the gao report which was produced at 
the request of two members of the senate agriculture committee 
sens jesse helms rnc and pete wilson rcalif 
the leveling off came at a time of increasing demand for dairy 
products and thus lowered surplus levels 
the report said federal purchases of surplus dairy products 
decreased from 132 billion pounds in 1985 to 106 billion pounds 
in 1986 they dropped to 67 billion pounds last year according to 
the report 
some 18 billion was paid out by the government for the 
program but 677 million of that was defrayed by farmers through 
assessments 
pressure to cut federal purchases of surplus dairy products had 
been building because of increasing costs the price tag for 
taxpayers climbed from about 247 million in fiscal 1979 to a high 
of 27 billion in fiscal 1983 
in the mid1980s the government experimented with a milk 
diversion program that also was designed to reduce federal 
purchases of surplus milk under it usda paid 38000 of the 
nations 200000 commercial milk producers to cut back sales by 5 
percent to 30 percent the results were not successful 
in the first year of the diversion 1984 us production was 
135 billion pounds of which the government bought 8 billion 
pounds in 1985 production was 143 billion pounds and the 
government purchased 13 billion pounds 
in key dairy states milk production rose sharply during the 
course of the program in california production increased 28 
percent in 1986 and 69 percent in 1987 in texas it was 30 
percent in 1986 and 84 percent in 1987 
the gao said that it sent out questionnaires to 650 dairy 
farmers who sought to participate in the program and were not able 
to do so and 545 of those whose bids were successful 
about half said they were greatly prompted to get into the 
program because doing so would prove more profitable than 
continuing dairy operations the gao said it said half reported 
they were somewhat to very greatly influenced by the need to get 
out of debt 
of those who did participate and received the payments 48 
percent reported they are now crop producers 44 percent maintain 
livestock operations 2 percent work for dairy farmers 15 percent 
do other farmrelated work 28 percent do nonfarm related work 5 
percent are unemployed but seeking work and 9 percent jobless and 
not seeking work 
about 26 percent of the participants in the program said that 
they either definitely would return to dairying after five years 
probably would do so or were just as likely as not to do so 
twentysix percent of the programs participants indicated 
that they probably would have quit dairying without the program 
the gao said about 40 percent of th farmers who bid on the 
program believe it will have little or no effect on milk production 
at the end of 5 years

legislation that would block further farmers 
home administration loans to farmers who have defaulted on earlier 
ones is being promised by rep joe dioguardi rny 
everyone knows you dont lend money to someone who failed to 
pay you back for an earlier loan dioguardi said in a statement 
issued monday everyone but the federal government that is 
he cited a farmers home administration estimate that it would be 
forced to write off 88 billion in defaulted loans under 
legislation that was approved by congress last year he said 
however that could mean borrowers would immediately become 
eligible for new loans 
to open up the credit window to these same debtors who cost us 
the 9 billion in the first place makes absolutely no sense the 
westchester county lawmaker said in addition allowing farmers 
to write off their debts with impunity destroys the incentive to be 
a good farmer 
several lawmakers notably sen kent conrad dny have been 
hotly protesting both fmhas statement that it may have to write 
off 88 billion and news media accounts that accept that statement 
uncritically they note that last years legislation calls for 
writing off such debts only in cases in which that way would be the 
least costly to the taxpayers

king hussein of jordan has made an 
unprecedented appeal to arab summit members to support the 
palestinian uprising in israel comparing the riots and bloodshed 
to algerias war of independence with france 
hussein often accused by arab hardliners of opposing the 
palestine liberation organization called the 6monthold uprising 
in the israelioccupied lands the path to liberation and 
dignity 
we extended to our algerian brothers all the support that we 
could as they struggled heroically to grasp their freedom from 
ugly colonial occupation he said after the emergency meeting of 
arab leaders opened tuesday 
just as the algerian revolution united arabs the palestinian 
revolution on the occupied palestinian soil is uniting our 
feelings he declared 
algeria won independence in 1962 after seven years of bitter 
struggle 
plo chief yasser arafat in his remarks to the summit vowed to 
keep up the uprising and inspire more riots until victory 
he reiterated the plos traditional demands the right to 
return to palestine the right to selfdetermination and right to 
create an independent state with jerusalem as its capital 
the threeday meeting of the 21nation arab league was convened 
to support the palestinian insurrection 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the june 1967 sixday war since antiisraeli riots began 
on dec 8 more than 200 palestinians and two israelis have been 
killed 
algerian president chadli bendjedid adjourned the meeting which 
was to resume today behind closed doors as the arab leagues 
secretarygeneral benjedid is summit chairman 
hussein met before the summit with arafat who also met with 
saudi arabias king fahd 
a palestinian source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the husseinarafat meeting was very warm and exceptionally 
friendly their relations became strained after hussein suspended 
his efforts to work jointly with the plo for a settlement with 
israel in february 1986 
bendjedid opened the summit by saying recognition of the plo was 
the key to any settlement of the middle east problem 
the united states and israel both refuse to recognize the plo as 
spokesman for the palestinians israel regards the plo as a 
terrorist organization 
summit sources said arab leaders were discussing financial 
support for the uprising in the range of 300 million to 400 
million to compensate for loss of income caused by strikes 
other subjects likely to be raised at the summit include the 
nearly 8yearold iraniraq war and the return of egypt to arab 
league egypt was expelled after signing a peace agreement with 
israel brokered by thenpresident carter

investigators are reviewing allegations that 
the immigration and naturalization service retaliated against 
agents who complained that an administrative assignment put their 
undercover identities in jeopardy and that they were told to 
falsify their time cards 
the alleged reprisals began after all eight agents in the 
houston antismuggling unit told congress they were being 
reassigned part of the time to contact employers about the new 
immigration law and sanctions for hiring illegal aliens 
they were allegedly told to record those duties as 
antismuggling work on their time cards 
us rep jack brooks dtexas and chairman of the house 
government operations committee contends the agents safety was 
threatened when they had to meet employers who may have been hiring 
illegal aliens 
id hate to be an undercover agent traveling around and 
visiting those big employers of aliens theyd recognize you youd 
stand out like a sore thumb brooks said 
but ins commissioner alan nelson said it is ludicrous to 
claim the agents cover was blown by meeting with employers nelson 
said hes not aware theres any truth to the allegations about 
the time cards 
its a basic and simple case of insubordination and failure to 
follow directions that started the whole thing nelson said it 
is our belief that they failed to perform their duties and 
appropriate action took place 
nelson said it was necessary nationwide to shift manpower to 
accomplish the visits with employers but apparently the men in 
houston were the only ones who just didnt want to do it 
brooks said the agents have continued to suffer although a 
source said members of the unit were reassigned this week to 
fulltime antismuggling duties 
brooks said he requested a general accounting office 
investigation in april because although the ins is treading a 
little more carefully until the heat dies down its topranking 
officials in their minds think they have done nothing wrong 
on rare occasions you find overzealous administrators who 
cover up their mistakes by persecuting the people who talked about 
it but never have i seen it with the terrible dangers this one 
reflects for the participants said brooks 
the office of special counsel an independent investigatory 
agency of the merit systems protection board is also 
investigating said laura baumgaertner executive assistant 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said he has looked into the 
situation and received wholly inadequate replies from the 
agencies involved 
we dont need an ins whitewash we need an objective 
assessment of the facts then we will know what other steps if 
any we need to take bentsen said tuesday 
after the agents complained in a letter sept 12 to brooks the 
ins southern regional office in dallas began an investigation of 
the agents which brooks contends violated the agencys own rules 
that its office of professional responsibility conduct such a probe 
in essence the agents allegations of impropriety were being 
handled by those they had complained about the immigration and 
naturalization service has demonstrated that it cannot fairly and 
impartially evaluate itself he said 
the justice departments office of professional responsibility 
however concluded in march that the ins investigation was not 
improper 
after they wrote congress four of the eight agents received the 
lowest of three possible ratings not recommended for promotion 
one was given the middle rating recommended for promotion which 
is also considered unfavorable three were given the highest rating 
highly recommended for promotion the five who received the 
unfavorable ratings were cited for a lack of loyalty to the 
service brooks said 
one of their supervisors charles griggs has been stripped of 
his supervisory duties and assigned fulltime to contacting 
employers by phone about the new immigration law griggs was named 
in 1983 as one of the nations top 10 law enforcement officers by 
the international chiefs of police and parade magazine the only 
ins officer to receive the award 
the other supervisor jamar hayes was downgraded and 
transferred to california and larry granelli the regional 
director of the ins office of professional responsibility in el 
paso was apparently reassigned after questioning the propriety of 
the ins investigation of the agents 
one of the four agents who was not recommended for promotion is 
fred capio who in 1986 receieved from nelson the commissioners 
award for heroism capio also served for two years in vietnam and 
received the bronze star

the 1988 presidential primaries are over but 
michael dukakis and george bush are still campaigning now seeking 
party unity at the summertime conventions in atlanta and new 
orleans and into the fall 
both nomineestobe are reaching out in the next few days to the 
men they defeated in the 39 primaries seeking to heal any wounds 
and to avoid any new squabbles and part of that process will be 
their choice of vice presidential running mates for the general 
election 
bush joins four of his five former republican rivals for a 
unity 88 meeting in denver on friday the first of several 
such meetings to lay the groundwork for the gop national convention 
in new orleans aug 1518 
dukakis his final primary victories in hand gathers the formal 
backing of some former democratic rivals today he will stop in st 
louis on the way home from california to receive the endorsement of 
rep richard gephardt while sen paul simon of illinois will add 
his support in a statement 
i dont see any great divisions within our party dukakis 
said before the votes were counted tuesday were going to have 
ourselves a great convention 
for the massachusetts governor the first challenge is jesse 
jackson 
the preacherturnedpolitician has been dukakis most persistent 
opponent hanging on to the end of the primaries and promising to 
continue all the way to the democratic national convention in 
atlanta july 1821 
suffice it to say were going to keep our campaign alive to 
july at the convention jackson said in los angeles 
jackson has stepped up his pressure on the massachusetts 
governor in the closing hours of the season on the vice 
presidency and on the issues in his strongest statement yet 
jackson suggested he had earned at least an offer of the no 2 spot 
on the ticket 
if he were to win extending the invitation to me is his 
option jackson said of dukakis it is an option my 
constituency has earned 
dukakis brushed aside such comments noting that jackson has 
said that it is up to the nominee to select a running mate and he 
also claimed to be unconcerned about the possibility of fights at 
the convention on issues jackson thinks are important 
we may have a floor fight or two dukakis said there may 
be some issues that go to the floor 
but jackson was conciliatory as well after a meeting monday 
night with dukakis 
hes sensitive on these matters and were going to have some 
followup meetings necessarily to discuss matters of platform 
credentials rules the convention itself and beyond that our 
strategy for winning in november jackson said 
jackson aides said he would remain in california for a week of 
rest resuming appearances next week and campaign manager gerald 
austin has talked of strategy sessions in the middle of the month 
with jackson continuing to campaign through the convention 
for his part dukakis will campaign remarkably hard for the next 
six weeks 
he says he will spend three days on the road in each of the 
coming six weeks touching base in key states for the fall the 
rest of the time he will spend in his statehouse office in boston 
or in campaign briefings 
the massachusetts governor will travel this weekend to utah to 
speak to the us conference of mayors 
his first extended trip is planned for next week with a major 
tour of the south stops in north carolina texas georgia and 
florida are tentatively scheduled in the region judged a stronghold 
for bush in the fall 
dukakis may run into jackson on one of his stops when he visits 
the texas state convention june 18 
later dukakis will touch on economic themes on a tour of 
industrial states at the end of the month 
the denver unity meeting is the first of at least three such 
sessions planned by the republican national committee which is 
picking up the bill one is scheduled later in june in cincinnati 
and another early in july in atlanta 
of bushs onetime rivals only pat robertson is not confirmed 
for the denver unity session friday and saturday 
republican officials said sen bob dole of kansas rep jack 
kemp of new york former delaware gov pete du pont and former 
secretary of state alexander haig have all agreed to attend 
with more than two months to go before the gop convention bush 
finds his campaign strapped for cash with only about 13 million 
left to spend before hitting the federal ceiling on primary 
spending 
but his aides have put together a variety of events to be paid 
for by the party or other gop candidates to keep the vice 
president on the road and in the news at party fundraisers and 
conventions across the country 
bush will not receive his federal allotment of 461 million 
until after the august convention while dukakis whose campaign 
is in better financial shape at the moment will receive his money 
in late july after the democratic meeting

the chairman of the white house aids 
commission says he senses momentum building in congress for passage 
of a federal law protecting people infected with the aids virus 
retired navy adm james d watkins made that observation tuesday 
night as the panel tentatively endorsed most of the 579 
recommendations he presented last week including the linchpin 
call for antidiscrimination legislation 
he said he has received encouraging letters from both sides of 
the aisle 
there is a feeling of momentum in congress he said adding 
that passage of antidiscrimination legislation is something that 
can be done in this session of congress i dont know that it will 
be 
watkins comments came as he urged the commission to agree with 
his plan to give top priority to the antidiscrimination issue in 
the introduction of the final report due at the white house june 
24 the reagan administration has opposed such legislation 
among the other recommendations the panel agreed to emphasize at 
the forefront of its final report 
that all of those infected with the aids virus an estimated 
15 million americans compared to less than 70000 actually 
diagnosed with the fullblown illness should be considered part 
of the epidemic 
that intravenous drug abuse is a national emergency that must 
be successfully dealt with if the aids epidemic is to be curtailed 
that the fight against the disease will require private as well 
as government resources 
that compassion for those with aids should be emphasized at all 
levels 
just as watkins prediction last week that most of his 
recommendations reflected the full panels consensus proved true 
so did his guess that his final chapter which he emphasized had 
not undergone advance discussion would run into opposition 
that was where he called for legislation to vest sweeping new 
powers in the surgeon general currently dr c everett koop to 
deal with national medical emergencies 
watkins said immediately after approval of such legislation 
president reagan should proclaim aids such an emergency and put 
koop in charge of dealing with it 
the commission did not reject those suggestions outright but it 
was clear they do not have broad backing 
the issue of what if anything to recommend in the way of 
administrative changes to deal with aids as well as future 
epidemics was put off to next week when the commission meets 
thursday and friday

salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte will 
probably undergo chemotherapy to treat the cancer that has spread 
from his stomach to his liver but duartes personal physician says 
the malignancy is terminal 
duarte underwent three hours of cancer surgery tuesday at walter 
reed army medical center in which doctors removed a portion of his 
stomach but left his diseased liver alone 
there was metastatic disease present in both lobes of the 
liver and this was not removed a hospital statement said 
that is going to end the life of president duarte said dr 
benjamin interiano duartes personal physician he said the 
average life expectancy for someone in duartes condition is six 
months but some patients live longer others shorter 
following duartes recuperation from surgery this disease 
will probably be treated with chemotherapy the hospital 
statement said 
duarte 62 tolerated the surgery well it said describing 
the operation as uneventful 
the salvadoran leader who was hospitalized here may 31 will 
remain in intensive care for a few days before returning to his 
regular hospital room for convalescence duartes family members 
were at the hospital 
duarte one of the united states staunchest allies in latin 
america is in the final year of a fiveyear presidential term 
vice president rodolfo castillo claramount is serving as acting 
president of el salvador in duartes absence

the wife of the late rep stewart b mckinney 
a republican who became the first member of congress known to have 
died from aids is urging the gop to put a strong electionyear 
statement on battling the deadly disease in the partys platform 
a republican platform devoid of a major commitment to solving 
the problems of aids would send a clear signal to the american 
people that the republican party wants to bury its head in the sand 
and not confront one of the major issues of our day lucie 
mckinney told republican officials tuesday at a platform hearing on 
social issues 
if the republicans are going to present themselves to the 
american people as the party of compassion then we as a party 
cannot fail to put forth a responsible policy on aids she said 
mrs mckinney has become an outspoken advocate of spending and 
research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the death 
last year of her husband a nineterm congressman from connecticut 
aids doesnt only touch people in big cities it is 
affecting people right in our home towns people we know people we 
grew up with people we work and live with people just like us 
she said 
mrs mckinney said the party platform should include pledges to 
increase spending for aids counseling for patients and families 
expand the availability of test drugs fight aids discrimination by 
employers and insurance companies and support aids residences that 
can help care for patients 
i dont want our platform to be silent on aids education 
because it might offend some people said sen lowell p weicker 
jr rconn i dont want to hear any rubbish that if you educate 
youre teaching people to be drug addicts or teaching people to be 
homosexuals 
the platform hearing was called at the request of weicker after 
domestic policy platform hearings were scheduled for kansas city 
weicker and other gop liberals and moderates felt the scheduling 
was an attempt by conservatives to push social issues such as aids 
and homelessness to the background 
john buchanan a former republican congressman from alabama and 
chairman of people for the american way action fund a liberal 
advocacy group on constitutional issues warned that the gop was 
slipping away from mainstream voters 
will we be the party of abraham lincoln and dwight eisenhower 
or the party of jerry falwell and phyllis schlafly buchanan said 
aids is an incurable condition that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections 
its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases are attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
mckinneys doctor said he probably contracted the aids virus 
from blood transfusions during heart surgery in 1979 but published 
reports following his death said mckinney had homosexual relations 
asked if the newspaper reports about homosexual encounters were 
true mrs mckinney has said she didnt know of any 
as of june 6 aids had been diagnosed in 64506 americans of 
whom more than half or 36255 have died according to the cdc no 
one is known to have recovered from aids

an advocacy group is calling on members of 
congress to do more to help black south african children saying 
they will be hurt by stronger us economic sanctions against the 
segregated nation 
the wake up america coalition dramatized its operation 
heartbreak campaign on tuesday by arranging for groups of black 
children to visit congressional offices 
some supporters of tougher sanctions intended to pressure the 
white minority government in pretoria into granting more freedoms 
to blacks expressed skepticism about the groups motives 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif called the campaign a a front 
for one of the many south african supported and funded groups 
there is no question in my mind that this is designed to develop 
opposition to the sanctions bill 
but the rev kenneth frazier chairman of the coalition said 
no matter what political side youre on antisanctions 
prosanctions antisanctions it doesnt matter 
we are here in the interest of millions of suffering black 
south african children who are already the poorest and the most 
helpless and the most vulnerable in south africa who will be 
further harassed and suffer all the more with a further round 
of us sanctions he said 
we are tired of seeing black and brown children the world over 
always carrying the political burdens and consequences of these 
irrational struggles for power among politicians east and west 
fraizer maintained that the campaign was not inspired by the 
vote on the comprehensive antiapartheid act of 1988 scheduled for 
the end of june he said his position is based on his own trips to 
south africa 
they are caught between apartheid and us sanctions which 
represent another form of hostility and oppression he said of 
the countrys blacks 
the coalition is delivering dolls of black children to 
congressional offices accompanied by letters appealing for 
contributions to help feed and clothe black south african children 
the letters ask recipients to donate 300 a year each to 
personally sponsor a childs food and clothing for as long as 
us sanctions legislation is in effect or until apartheid is 
totally dismantled 
the letters also ask for a statement of support by june 21 so 
that we can brief your constituents on where you stand 
dymally said such tactics constitute political intimidation 
this is designed to intimidate liberals and to solidify the 
opposition of the right he said

the worlds most powerful cyclotron has just 
passed a crucial test showing it can fire atomic cannon balls 
instead of bbs and stands ready for some of the most promising 
experiments ever proposed by nuclear physicists the national 
science foundation said today 
the nsf said scientists at the governmentfunded national 
superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university 
succeeded monday in bending a narrow highenergy beam of neon 
nuclei so that it flew out of the cyclotron cleanly and hit a 
stainless steel target 
that success the nsf said means the k800 cyclotron is ready 
for a series of atomsmashing experiments that could guide 
physicists to fundamental rules governing subatomic matter it is 
hoped the studies eventually will lead to a better understanding of 
the forces directing cosmic events such as the explosions of 
stars or supernovas 
the energy of the test beam fired this week was 360 million 
electron volts but the machine is capable of accelerating nuclei 
to energies approaching 8 billion electron volts by comparison 
the worlds second most powerful heavyion cyclotron ganil in 
caen france has accelerated beams to energies of 4 billion 
electron volts 
the us test means that precision beams of heavy nuclei can now 
be directed into laboratories at the east lansing mich facility 
for use in further experiments the nsf said 
scientists generated the k800 cyclotrons first highenergy beam 
in february using its superconducting magnet to accelerate 
electrically charged helium and carbon nuclei in a tight spiral 
within the 7footdiameter confines of the cyclotrons magnetic 
field the nuclei gradually attained a speed of more than 60000 
miles per second the latest test succeeded in targeting a beam 
consisting of the cores of heavier atoms opening the door to a 
wider array of discoveries 
the k800 is unique for both the intensity and the uniformity 
of the beam of nuclei it can generate said henry g blosser who 
originated the superconducting accelerator concept and who 
codirects the facility along with msu physics professor sam austin 
blosser said the machine for which construction began in 1980 
can accelerate a beam of nuclei of even the heaviest naturally 
occurring element uranium to speeds that will lead to nuclear 
reactions that have never been observed before 
in comparison with pre1980s cyclotrons its like being able 
to accelerate cannon balls instead of bbs he said 
when a heavy nucleus in the cyclotron beam approaches the 
nucleus of a target atom with sufficient speed to overcome their 
electrical repulsion or about 20000 miles per second the 
nuclei can come together and overlap for an instant the 
overlapping nuclei might fly apart almost unchanged might eject 
neutrons and protons to form a more stable combined nucleus or 
might even break up into a number of mediumsized fragments 
scientists expect more than 30 nuclear particles to be emitted in 
some of the more violent collisions 
a complex array of electronic radiation detectors linked to 
computers will record the outcome of the collisions physicists 
hope that by studying the effects of temperature pressure and 
energy of impact they will be able to define fundamental 
relationships governing nuclear matter and reactions similar to 
the thermodynamic and quantum mechanical equations that have been 
established for chemical reactions among molecules 
austin said the collisions of heavy nuclei will lead to 
extremes of density and temperature as great as those that cause 
stars to explode and which occurred in the big bang that created 
the universe experiments with the new cyclotron may possibly 
even lead to the creation of new heavier atomic elements he said 
while cyclotrons and other particle accelerators are designed 
and operated primarily for physics research the chemical isotopes 
and radioactive elements that can be produced are also used in 
medical research and treatment 
the nsf has supported cyclotron research at msu since 1961 an 
earlier model the k500 went into operation in 1982 and has been 
host for more than 275 scientists from 47 institutions it was the 
first superconducting cyclotron in the world using like the 
sister k800 titaniumniobium alloy magnets which lost all 
resistance to electricity when chilled with liquid helium to minus 
450 degrees fahrenheit near absolute zero the 1988 operating 
budget for the entire laboratory is 71 million

a north korean official said today he 
defected because he could not fulfill government orders to obtain 
counterfeit american dollars for clandestine operations 
kim chong min 44 told a news conference he was ordered to 
obtain 500000 in bogus bills for use in foreign operations kim 
said he never found out what the money was for and was censured 
when he tried to ask 
kim also said he defected because he failed to meet an order to 
raise 2 million in real american currency to finance north korean 
government construction projects 
south korean officials said kim was head of the staterun 
taeyang trading co kim said previously he served in the ministry 
of public security for 19 years and rose to the rank of lieutenant 
colonel 
the ministry is responsible for state security and espionage 
operations in the communist north the two koreas divided since 
1945 are bitter foes 
kim said his company was ordered to raise foreign currency by 
buying cobalt and other minerals in zaire and nigeria to be resold 
for profit in east germany czechoslovakia and poland 
unable to make profits or obtain bogus bills kim said he 
defected because he feared he would be jailed as punishment for 
failing kim said he was afraid his family would be punished 
because he defected 
on april 25 when he arrived in an unidentified european nation 
from moscow via berlin kim said he telephoned the local south 
korean embassy and asked to defect he arrived in seoul may 1 
kim said the 2 million he was ordered to raise was to be used 
to construct a commercial center in preparation for the 13th world 
youth festival scheduled for september 1989 in pyongyang the north 
korean capital 
he said the north faced with a drastic shortage of hard 
currency was frantic about earning dollars to help finance various 
development projects particularly to modernize its economy 
kim also said the father of a selfconfessed north korean woman 
agent involved in the nov 29 bombing of a south korean airliner 
was recalled from a diplomatic assignment in angola 
the woman kim hyon hui who was captured and brought to seoul 
after the plane was lost with all 115 people aboard confessed in a 
news conference that the plane was destroyed to disrupt the olympic 
games scheduled to begin in seoul in september north korea is 
demanding to cohost the games 
kim said the recall made him think the bombing was the work of 
the north although it has denied any involvement in the incident 
kim denied he defected because he had been offered money to do 
so the seoul government traditionally awards large sums to 
defectors from the communist north

kenneth c osmond who played wiseguy eddie 
haskell on the leave it to beaver tv series was granted a 
police department disability pension by a state court 
superior court judge kurt lewin on tuesday ordered the board of 
pension commissioners to reverse itself and grant the 46yearold 
osmond a serviceconnecteddisability pension retroactive to his 
last day of service 
osmond played the beavers nemesis on the show from 1957 to 
1963 he reprised eddie for a cbs movie in 1983 and for a revival 
of the series on the disney channel before doing the new leave it 
to beaver which is relayed by atlanta superstation wtbs to more 
than 10000 cable systems 
the former motorcycle officer contended that he suffered deep 
depression after being shot three times by a suspect he was 
pursuing in september 1980 his bulletproof vest stopped two slugs 
and a third ricocheted off his belt buckle 
all of the psychiatrists agree that osmonds condition is a 
real and disabling psychiatric condition lewin said in his 
ruling nowhere in the administrative record is it suggested that 
he has feigned his symptoms the board had ruled osmond was not 
disabled 
osmond contended his condition improved when he was released 
from duty between september 1981 and march 1982 but that it 
worsened when he went back to work he said he began drinking 
excessively to relieve the stress 
lewin said he believed that if osmond returned even to light 
duty he would have another relapse 
deputy city attorney eudon ferrell argued the boards finding 
was correct he said osmond had expressed disenchantment with the 
criminal justice system the police department and law enforcement 
in general

michael dukakis who clinched the delegates he 
needed to lock in the democratic presidential nomination tuesday 
night proclaimed tomorrow the race to the finish line begins 
victories in the four final primaries of the season gave the 
massachusetts governor a mathematical lock on more than the 2081 
delegates he needs to ensure his nomination at the partys 
convention next month 
dukakis won races in california new jersey montana and new 
mexico 
my friends california has put us over the top dukakis told 
a latenight victory rally in los angeles 
dukakis told supporters though that someone is missing 
his wife kitty who is in a boston hospital following spinal surgery 
last week his comment echoed that of his wife earlier in the 
evening 
i wish i was somewhere else mrs dukakis said from her 
hospital bed 
looking ahead to the confrontation with vice president george 
bush the certain republican nominee dukakis said he hoped to avoid 
a negative campaign 
every day between now and november the american people will 
want to hear how we intend to build a strong and vibrant future for 
our country he said they arent interested in slashing 
attacks 
underscoring the point he warned the republicans not to engage 
in mudslinging and namecalling 
the american people are not interested in what mr bush thinks 
of me or what i think of him he said 
in his speech the democratic nomineetobe paid tribute to his 
most durable democratic competitor jesse jackson 
i know i speak with pride for every american when i speak about 
this race a son of immigrants from massachusetts and a black man 
who grew up poor in south carolina are the two finalists for the 
democratic nomination for the presidency of the united states he 
said 
dukakis who has been engaged in delicate maneuverings aimed at 
keeping jacksons constituency without agreeing to all of his 
rivals demands said earlier tuesday that he agreed with jackson 
that it was up to the nominee to choose his running mate 
jackson however was saying that an offer of the no 2 spot to 
him was an option my constituency has earned 
we may have a floor fight or two at the convention next 
month dukakis said there may be some issues that go to the 
floor i dont see any great divisions within our party were going 
to have ourselves a great convention 
dukakis and jackson held a private 90minute meeting that broke 
up in the early morning hours tuesday 
dukakis said they had not discussed the no 2 spot on the ticket 
a position jackson gave increasing signals that he had an interest 
in dukakis said the two talked in general terms about a jackson 
role in a dukakis administration but he declined to elaborate 
jackson told reporters separately they discussed south africa 
party rules and convention delegates 
dukakis contended he had no differences with jackson on south 
africa the issue jackson has cited as one he may take to the 
convention floor in atlanta but at the same time dukakis refused to 
meet jacksons insistence that he agree to label south africa a 
terrorist nation 
i dont see the importance of labels here dukakis said 
he repeated his support for a bill applying tougher sanctions 
against the racially separated nation and he blasted naked 
military aggression by south africa against its neighbors 
i dont see any great divisions on this or any other issue 
dukakis said 
dukakis and bush met briefly between appearances before the tv 
group and discussed what dukakis spokesman mark gearan said were 
general pleasantries 
dukakis planned to return to massachusetts early wednesday he 
planned a stop in st louis on the way where defeated democratic 
presidential rival rep richard gephardt dmo planned to endorse 
his candidacy another former candidate sen paul simon dill 
planned to offer his support in washington

the government has resolved a crisis 
in its relationship with nato by ruling that alliance warships will 
be allowed to visit denmark without revealing if theyre carrying 
nuclear weapons 
prime minister poul schlueter said tuesday that his government 
will notify the diplomatic missions of its nato allies of denmarks 
peacetime ban on nuclear weapons visiting vessels however will 
receive no such notice 
a dispute over toughening denmarks longstanding nuclear weapons 
ban triggered an unscheduled election may 10 that ended in a 
political stalemate and schlueter returned as prime minister in a 
minority coalition last week 
before the elections the socialist opposition pushed a 
resolution through the folketing or parliament that obliged the 
government to remind visiting warships of denmarks nuclear policy 
although the resolution of april 14 stands the new centerright 
government will send a note to the diplomatic missions of nato 
countries concerned rather than to each naval vessel schlueter 
said 
there is no mention of nuclear weapons in the note 
but the sentence the visit of the vessel is on condition that 
it takes place according regulations set down by the danish 
government will be inserted in the foreign ministrys standard 
notice 
since 1976 denmark has required all foreign warships wishing to 
pass through its waters or dock at its ports to seek permission via 
diplomatic channels 
it is the governments view that this procedure repects our 
allies policy of neither to confirm nor to deny the presence of 
nuclear weapons on board their naval vessels schlueter said 
the government has been in touch with allied governments which 
share this view he added 
the united states and britain two nuclear powers whose warships 
make frequent visits in danish ports had objected strongly to the 
resolution 
its implementation by means of a letter to naval captains could 
have prevented allied ships from participating in nato sea 
exercises in danish waters and undermine the alliances nuclear 
deterrence strategy they said 
the new cabinet the third nonsocialist administration headed 
by schlueter since 1982 was announced last friday 
svend auken leader of the main opposition social democratic 
party that sponsored the resolution called the governments move 
a weak signal to the outside world about denmarks nuclear 
policy

coalition goverment a coup led by ethnic fijians ousted the 
coalition government 13 months ago 
authorities meanwhile said a brotherinlaw of interim prime 
minister ratu sir kamisese mara was among 15 people charged with 
conspiring to illegally import the weapons 
ratu mosese tuisawau 67 half brother of maras wife adi lady

government was overthrown in the may 14 1987 coup 
datt foreign minister in the bavadra government said today 
that police interrogations had been difficult 
it is clear they were trying to implicate me in the gun 
running he told reporters 
security forces found caches of buried arms on monday and 
tuesday the seizures came one week after customs officers in 
australia intercepted a huge arms shipment also bound for fiji 
australian officials said there were enough arms to start a 
small war 
coup leader sitiveni rabuka has claimed the arms shipments were 
part of a foreign plot to destabilize the nation but he has not 
specifically accused any country group or organization 
rabuka staged two coups last year claiming he was protecting 
the political rights of ethnic fijians who are outnumbered by 
indians in the 715000 population 
rabuka has since handed power to an interim government headed by 
mara while a new constitution is drafted that will guarantee fijian 
dominance in a future parliament 
he remains head of the army and appointed himself minister for 
home affairs in charge of national security

one of the most vocal critics of house speaker 
jim wrights ethics has acknowledged that like wright he once had 
a congressional aide work on a book published under his name 
but rep newt gingrich rga said tuesday that the work his 
aide did on his book window of opportunity before its 
publication in 1984 was much different from the work wrights aide 
did on the speakers book reflections of a public man 
gingrich who asked the house ethics committee last month to 
investigate wrights personal financial dealings said hes 
fairly confident he asked frank gregorsky his administrative 
assistant in 1984 to review the manuscript of his book because 
hes a first class writer 
that is totally appropriate and to the extent that a staff 
member filled that role it would not be inappropriate gingrich 
said in a telephone interview tuesday 
matthew cossolotto a former aide to wright said in interviews 
this week that he spent 150 to 200 hours while on wrights 
congressional staff working on the speakers book 
house records show that cossolotto also was paid 2078 from 
official congressional accounts to cover his expenses during a 1984 
trip to texas when he oversaw the final editing of the book 
wright has refused to comment on the matter since sunday when 
he defended cossolottos assignment during a telephone interview 
with the washington post he canceled his regular daily news 
briefing tuesday and denied an associated press request for an 
interview on the subject 
gingrichs request for a house ethics committee investigation of 
wright came several weeks before cossolottos role in the 
production of wrights book became known publicly 
but gingrich said tuesday he thinks the ethics panel also should 
examine whether wright violated house rules by assigning cossolotto 
to work on the book 
the idea of using 200 hours of having it be your only job 
assignment of charging over 2000 for a trip which a staffer says 
was only for the purpose of going to fort worth in order to write 
the book it seems to me thats clearly wrong he said 
gingrich said gregorskys only role in his own book was 
reviewing the manuscript before it was published he said he wrote 
the first draft himself and the final draft was done with help from 
his wife and a professional writer who was paid by the publisher 
because of questions about such use of congressional staffers 
gingrich said he is preparing a letter to his colleagues suggesting 
the creation of a bipartisan panel of retired congressmen to 
reexamine the basic ethics rules of the house 
in a related development the washington times reported today 
that wright transferred 97700 in contributions to his 1976 
campaign to repay personal debts but failed to report it in annual 
house financial disclosure statements 
federal election regulations allowed such transfers which took 
place in 1976 and 1977 but house ethics rules required that they 
be disclosed as personal income the newspaper said 
the house ethics committee meets thursday for a second session 
to consider gingrichs complaint against wright the panel met 
behind closed doors for several hours last week without reaching 
any decision on whether to launch an investigation 
part of gingrichs complaint asked the ethics committee to 
investigate reports that wright receives unusually high royalties 
of 55 percent for his book which was published by a company that 
was paid more than 250000 for services to wrights reelection 
campaign in 198586 
carlos moore whose company published the book said tuesday the 
20000 press run has been sold out with most copies being sold 
directly by his company for 595 each he said wright received 
325 on each book and the company 270 
some copies of the book however were sold to bookstores for 
3 moore said and wright received only 1 per book royalties on 
those 
in the interview with the washington post wright had responded 
to reports that lobbyists had purchased multiple copies of the book 
by saying he would be glad to have moore provide a list of the 
purchasers 
but moore said no such list was available although he 
speculated that very few were sold o bookstores 
if i had to guess how many we sold to bookstores id say 
between 2000 and 3000 he said why take in 3 when i can 
take in 595

the us navy 
has yet to test its expanded policy of defending nonus flag 
vessels in the persian gulf more than a month after it went ito 
effect 
but the prospect of facing that test is not lost on the officers 
and men of ships like the john hancock as they arrive to take up 
the navys main mission of escorting usflagged kuwaiti tankers 
plying the gulf 
the john hancock was beginning its first such assignment on 
tuesday charged with shepherding the gas princess a 46723ton 
liquefied petroleum gas carrier down the gulf and out through the 
strait of hormuz 
cmdr robert b odonnell skipper of the john hancock said 
that when the destoyer passed through the socalled silkworm 
envelope to enter the gulf for the first time saturday our 
adrenalin level went up 
but he said that his crew of 330 felt they were well prepared 
and ready for any eventuality that we might face here in the 
persian gulf 
the convoy was the 34th of this year and the 56th since the 
reagan administration agreed last year to reregister 11 of 
kuwaits stateowned oil tankers under the stars and stripes and 
provide them with protection from attack in the gulf where iran 
and iraq have been at war for nearly eight years 
the john hancock a destroyer based in mayport fla is one of 
five warships that arrived in the gulf in the past few days as part 
of regular rotation 
in an interview with members of a pentagon news media pool on 
the john hancocks bridge odonnell described its mission as not 
only protecting vessels under the us flag but serving as a symbol 
of the american presence 
were here to let the petty tyrants and despots of the world 
know that they shouldnt fool with the united states of america 
and specifically the united states navy 
but he steered away from discussion of the recent expansion of 
the us rules of engagement that permit american commanders to go 
to the aid of nonus flag ships that are under attack and appeal 
for assistance 
since the change went into effect may 3 iranian gunboats have 
carried out four known attacks on neutral merchant vessels in the 
southern gulf and the strait of hormuz gateway to the gulf but 
all were too far away for patrolling us warships to intervene 
in the nearest thing to a direct usiran ecnounter the 
aegistype missile cruiser vincennes found itself in the role of a 
curious and frustrated observer last thursday when an iranian 
frigate stopped boarded and then escorted away a cypriot flag 
freighter apparently suspected of carrying warconnected cargo 
us navy sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
vincennes received no distress appeal from the freighter but 
followed the two vessels for some time as they headed toward the 
iranian port of bandar abbas 
one source said the vincennes skipper capt will c rogers iii 
wanted to help him real bad 
they were doing everything that they could to give that guy an 
opportunity said the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
they were even looking for signal lights for something 
but he said the vincennes heard and saw nothing that would 
indicate the master of the 10000ton vevey wanted the american 
ship to come to his aid 
greek owners of the vevey said the ship whose cargo was listed 
as marble chips from italy was released by the iranians a day 
after it was detained and continued on its voyage to saudi arabia 
and kuwait

montanas republicans on tuesday chose 
conrad burns a county commissioner from billings to challenge 
democratic sen john melcher who smothered an obscure challenge in 
his partys primary 
former gov thomas judge won the democratic primary to vie for 
the succession of retiring twoterm democratic gov ted schwinden 
and former state sen stan stephens won the gops gubernatorial 
primary to oppose him 
in the presidential primaries massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
easily outdistanced jesse jackson in the democratic contest for 
montanas 19 delegates while vice president george bush walked away

melcher 64 seeking a third senate term put down an 
underfinanced and barely visible challenge from robert kelleher a 
billings lawyer 
burns beat thomas faranda a minnesotan who filed for the gop 
nomination but gave up his absentee bid weeks ago though his name 
remained on the ballot 
melcher said the difference between him and burns was experience 
i think its pretty obvious ive been here awhile he said 
hes going to try and say thats a disadvantage but i dont 
really think it is 
the longer youre here the more chances you have to get bills 
passed that will benefit montana he said in a telephone 
interview from his suburban outside washington dc 
with 641 of 982 precincts or 65 percent reporting melcher had 
55011 votes or 747 percent compared to 18609 or 253 percent for

with montanas economy in the doldrums the campaign for governor 
revolved around varying plans for reviving it central issues were 
whether to enact a retail sales tax montana has none and whether 
to tap a multimilliondollar trust fund built from coal severance 
taxes during the boom years of energy exploration 
judge who was governor during some of those boom years before 
schwinden beat him in the 1980 primary harkened back to those days 
in urging voters to return him to the statehouse but his rivals 
said the prosperity of those years had nothing to do with judge 
the keystone of morrisons campaign was his pledge to veto any 
sales tax whatever its purpose or design 
winslow proposed a 3 percent sales tax as a replacement for 
property taxes he said were too high

city councilman donald payne has wanted to be 
new jerseys first black congressman for the past 14 years but 
always faced a major obstacle rep peter rodino dnj 
rodino who turned 79 on tuesday was first elected in 1948 to 
represent the 10th district and was reelected to 20 consecutive 
terms even after the district got a black majority in 1972 
this year rodino announced his retirement under increasing 
pressure to let the district be represented by the states first 
black congressman 
that gave payne 53 his first serious chance at congress since 
1974 when he declared his candidacy for a proposed new district 
that never was created 
i feel like i have earned the right to represent this district 
i have earned the right to succeed peter rodino said payne vice 
president of a computer forms company 
tuesday night payne handily defeated his democratic opponent 
fellow councilman ralph t grant jr to win the nomination which 
is tantamount to a general election in the heavily democratic 
district 
it gives our delegation the fairness its been lacking for many 
years i can speak from a true urban perspective payne said 
payne softspoken often shy in crowds and uncomfortable in front 
of the camera began his public service career working with the 
ymca he became the national organizations first black president in 
1970 
in 1972 he was elected to the essex county board of chosen 
freeolders roughy equivalent to a county commissioner and served 
for six years 
payne announced in 1974 that he would be a candidate for congress 
should a redistricting open up a new district the plan fell through 
in the legislature and payne turned to newark city politics 
in the 1986 primary payne contended that it was time a minority 
candidate represented the largely innercity district paynes 
campaign was boosted by a number of personal appearances by jesse 
jackson 
rodino captured about 60 percent of the vote but felt enough 
pressure to during the primary to hint that his 20th term would be 
his last

a black woman who faces arrest for refusing to 
testify about her daughters alleged abduction and rape by six 
whites will take sanctuary in a church to seek relief from a 
higher authority one of her lawyers says 
but authorities have issued a statewide warrant for glenda 
brawley and said shes fair game for arrest 
on monday the 33yearold mrs brawley was sentenced to 30 days 
in jail for defying a grand jury subpoena to testify but upon the 
urging of state attorney general robert abrams she was given one 
more chance an opportunity to tell a judge today why she had 
refused to cooperate 
however attorney alton maddox jr who has claimed state 
officials are involved in a racially motivated coverup said mrs 
brawley would take sanctuary in a black church rather than appear 
before a grand jury in poughkeepsie this morning 
the history of this nation will be on trial tomorrow and i dare 
robert abrams or gov mario cuomo to come into the black church 
maddox said at a news conference tuesday 
glenda brawley will be seeking relief before a higher 
authority she will be putting her life in gods hands 
you dont mess with black people in their churches said mrs 
brawleys sister juanita 
neither maddox nor other brawley family advisers participating in 
the news conference attorney c vernon mason and the rev al 
sharpton would say what church would offer mrs brawley asylum 
though sharpton said it was in new york city they insisted 
authorities had no right to enter a church to arrest her 
maddox said there was a longstanding precedent that persons who 
have been oppressed politically can seek asylum in a church 
but sgt john clifford a new york city police department 
spokesman said the decision to arrest people who request sanctuary 
privileges is decided on a casebycase basis 
police are allowed to arrest suspects who run into a church the 
spokesman said however if the suspect requests refuge and is 
granted sanctuary by the pastor police must obtain a search warrant 
to make an arrest or negotiate with the parties involved clifford 
said 
tim gilles a spokesman for abrams said tuesday night that due 
to the confrontational nature of developments during the day 
abrams told the dutchess county sheriffs office he no longer had 
objections to arresting mrs brawley immediately 
shes fair game said sheriffs capt dennis okeeffe whose 
office filed a statewide warrant for her arrest tuesday 
abrams who is directing the grand jury investigation at the 
governors request had said earlier he would not press for an 
arrest until at least this afternoon 
at the news conference mason reiterated the theme of the 
brawleys and their advisers saying it is clear we cannot get 
justice for tawana brawley 
he said authorities had done everything possible to blame the 
victim even more how ludicrous it is for the nation to see that the 
only person arrested in this case is the mother of a black rape 
victim people should be outraged 
tawana brawley was found nov 28 four days after she had 
disappeared 
the 16yearold high school student was lying dazed in a plastic 
bag in a road in wappingers falls about 10 miles south of 
poughkeepsie her hair had been shorn animal excrement had been 
smeared on her body and racial epithets had been scrawled on her 
torso 
she said shed been attacked by six white men and alleged that 
one flashed a policelike badge 
neither she nor her family has cooperated with investigators or 
made public more details her mother was not in the dutchess county 
courtroom monday when state judge angelo ingrassia sentenced her to 
jail and fined her 250

the leftist sandinista government and 
usbacked rebels moved closer to a settlement as they began 
another round of peace talks both sides reported progress on the 
key issue of democratic reforms 
negotiators who meet again today discussed on tuesday a 
government proposal that a sandinista official said accedes to 
nearly all contra rebel demands for ending the ruling partys 
political monopoly 
before they lay down their arms and end six years of fighting 
the rebels want guaranteed freedom of the press an end to 
sandinista control of the army and government the right to strike 
and judicial and electoral reforms 
we have made substantial advances information minister 
manuel espinoza said after tuesdays session in managua that opened 
the fourth round of negotiations since the foes signed a preliminary 
peace accord on march 23 
bosco mamatoros spokesman for the rebels said there were 
advances in the discussion on themes of a substantial character 
but added that political reform remains the biggest problem in the 
discussions 
a government representative who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said earlier that the sandinistas had agreed to nearly all rebel 
demands for political reform 
the sandinista proposal was also said to offer the contras a role 
in talks begun late last year between the government and domestic 
opposition parties 
an american negotiator for the government said tuesday that the 
two main obstacles to a definitive settlement were the fine print of 
disarmament and amnesty for jailed contras 
paul reichler a washingtonbased attorney said the sandinistas 
want full disarmament and reintegration of the contras into civilian 
life by the end of september he said the rebels had proposed laying 
down their weapons by the end of january 
reichler said the rebel proposal was linked to the us 
presidential elections in november and january inauguration of a new 
president to preserve a military option 
he called it one last roll of the dice on a george bush 
victory the vice president is the likely republican nominee 
but the sandinista proposal also may be linked to the us 
elections 
a ceasefire in hand by november would favor the democrats a 
majority of whom have opposed continued us military assistance for 
the rebels it also would represent an embarrassment for the 
republican administration 
the democratic majority in congress rejected president reagans 
last request for additional military aid to the rebels which ended 
feb 26 congress last approved a military aid package for the 
contras in june 1986 that totalled 100 million 
reichler said the contras also wanted to change the amnesty plan 
agreed to by both sides in march that plan calls on the government 
to release half of jailed rebels after contra combatants move into 
truce zones and the remainder at a still undetermined date 
he said the contras are calling for the release of all prisoners 
five days after the rebels move into the truce areas 
the talks are taking place amid a temporary truce enacted march 
21 the rebels have extended the truce until thursday and the 
government has declared a unilateral ceasefire until the end of 
june 
each side accuses the other of violations 
heavy fighting was reported tuesday near juigalpa capital of 
central chontales state a sandinista soldier who asked not to be 
identified told the associated press the fighting involved at least 
70 contras and 50 army troops 
two contras were captured and an undetermined number of 
government troops were wounded and taken by helicopter to a hospital 
in juigalpa he said

unknowns in the democratic senate primary tuesday to win the right 
to face republican sen pete wilson whose seat has jinxed 
incumbents for 30 years

could have quarantined aids victims and early returns tuesday 
showed voters opposing the relaxation of government spending limits 
and favoring a 1 billion transportation bond 
with 4267 of 23606 precincts reporting 18 percent of the

swept to an easy victory over jesse jackson netting the fraction of 
the states democratic delegates needed to clinch his partys 
nomination while vice president george bush won the states 
republican primary where 175 delegates were being awarded 
san diego mayor maureen oconnor won election to a full fouryear 
term by gaining a majority of the vote in a nonpartisan primary in 
the nations seventhlargest city 
with 8 percent of precincts reporting she had 15145 votes or 
573 percent and her nearest rival former city councilman floyd 
morrow had 9242 votes or 35 percent 
among ballot measures with about 21 percent of precincts 
reporting voters were opposing proposition 71 by 53 percent to 47 
percent the measure would ease the spending limits californians 
placed on their state government in a 1979 voter initiative 
permitting an estimated 700 million annual increase in state 
spending and reducing by an equal amount the funds likely to be 
earmarked for future tax rebates 
proposition 72 which would also change the spending limit but 
with almost exactly the opposite effect was trailing 61 percent to 
39 percent in early returns it would reduce the limit for most 
state programs by an estimated 725 million annually by earmarking 
those funds exclusively for highways 
with 21 percent of the vote counted the tally against a proposal 
backed by extremist lyndon larouche to declare aids a communicable 
disease subjecting victims to potential quarantine was soundly 
rejected by 747702 votes or 67 percent to 369934 percent or 33 
percent 
meanwhile a 1 billion bond measure sponsored by gov george 
deukmejian to fund highway construction and improvement part of a 
recordbreaking 32 billion in bonds was being narrowly favored 51 
percent to 49 percent 
in sacramento county with 20 percent of the total tallied a 
measure seeking closure of the rancho seco nuclear power plant 
trailed by 29238 votes or 49 percent to 31087 votes or 52 percent 
it could mark the first time in history that voters directly ordered 
closure of a nuclear plant 
a proposal to carve out a new mojave county from the eastern 
desert portions of san bernardino county the nations largest was 
trailing by nearly 21 in returns from absentee voters other issues 
included competing proposals to limit campaign spending 
voters in seven southern california communities were being asked 
to adopt initiatives designed to slow growth or make developers pay 
for it in northern and western los angeles county supervisor mike 
antonovich was challenged by candidates who said he has allowed 
developers to make their lives miserable 
antonovich got just 504 percent of the absentee vote in a field 
of 10 candidates if he fails to win more than 50 percent of the 
vote in the nonpartisan contest he would be forced into a fall 
runoff with the other top votegetter 
the one congressional incumbent with a serious primary challenge 
was freshman republican ernest konnyu an outspoken conservative 
from the san jose suburb of saratoga with 52 percent of the vote 
counted he was trailing stanford university professor tom campbell 
a moderate by 2188 votes to 2820 
campbell was supported by konnyus two republican predecessors 
former reps pete mccloskey and ed zschau 
in two heavily republican los angelesarea congressional 
districts two former white house aides were leading in races for 
gop nominations to replace retiring incumbents both of their 
campaigns had featured appearences by indicted former white house

the aids proposition was opposed by the california medical 
association and the leadership of both major parties it was almost 
identical to a measure sponsored by larouches organization which 
was defeated by a 21 margin by californians in 1986 
the two spending limit propositions were both indirectly linked 
to the proposition 13 tax cut initiative approved by voters 10 years 
ago as each sought to amend the spending limits imposed in a 
followup initiative to 13 
twentysix local tax measures were also linked to proposition 13 
which required voter approval for any tax increase above the 
ceilings it set in 1978 eleven counties were asking voters to 
approve sales tax hikes for libraries highways jails or other 
local programs and 15 other jurisdictions sought additional 
property or hotel taxes 
in the senate primary both wilson and mccarthy concentrated on 
fundraising and laying the groundwork for their november faceoff 
wilsons success at avoiding even token opposition was evidence 
of how succcessfully the moderate former san diego mayor has 
neutralized his oncevocal critics from the conservative wing of the 
gop 
wilson has led mccarthy in fundraising and the polls but has to 
contend with a political jinx no one has been reelected to his 
senate seat in more than 30 years

tuesday night for clinching the democratic presidential nomination 
on the last night of their fourmonth primary duel and repeated his 
contention that he deserves serious consideration to be dukakis 
running mate 
i believe we have shown it is possible to compete without 
conflict differ without division jackson said in remarks 
prepared for delivery to supporters gathered at a los angeles hotel 
he said he had built a mighty coalition and we have made 
america better 
jackson pledged to go to the democratic national convention as 
the new democratic majority to set the agenda for our nation and 
our party 
earlier in an interview on abc he said well have to work 
together 
michael dukakis is due very special congratulations jackson 
said in the interview just after the massachusetts governor scored 
victories in the final races in california new jersey montana and 
new mexico 
but jackson noted that in a technical sense the race is not 
over until the democratic national convention next month dukakis 
has now earned enough delegates to be assured of a firstballot 
victory there 
earlier tuesday as voters were going to the polls jackson 
pledged to keep campaigning for delegates until the democratic 
national convention 
dukakis claimed enough delegates to sew up the presidential 
nomination in the final primaries on tuesday but jackson told 
reporters he had no intention of throwing in the towel arguing that 
many delegates will still be uncommitted until the convention in 
midjuly 
he said at one point that his supporters deserve the option of 
having him on the ticket a contention that seemed to go beyond his 
previous statements that he merely deserves consideration for the 
vice presidential spot if he doesnt win the presidential nomination 
but under questioning later he declined to pursue that saying 
it would be up to the convention to determine the nominee and his 
running mate 
the presidential nominee he said recommends to the 
convention which then selects his running mate 
suffice it to say were going to keep our campaign alive to 
july at the convention he said ted kennedy did it in 1980 
gary hart did it in 1984 i will do it in 1988 
he said he will be contacting atlarge delegates and super 
delegates trying to persuade them to support him instead of 
dukakis 
the commitments made by atlarge and super delegates are 
nonbinding until convention time and so its appropriate to make 
appeals to delegates based upon friendship based upon constituent 
considerations he said 
jackson spent election day in california speaking to an abc 
convention and to two rallies in the los angeles area 
he said he and dukakis did not discuss the vice presidency or any 
adminstration role for jackson in their latenight meeting on monday 
he called it a good meeting an effective meeting covering a 
wide range of issues including south africa the soviet union the 
party platform and universal voter registration 
jackson who has repeatedly said dukakis is too conservative and 
cautious said he will keep the pressure on the frontrunner in 
future meetings to espouse more progressive positions 
its all right for him to be conservative because thats the 
way he feels its his basic approach but balance would be in the 
progressive dirction jackson said 
he said he wants to keep an open dialogue with dukakis 
earlier in a panel interview before a meeting of abc affiliates 
jackson said it would be dukakis option whether to offer him a spot 
on the ticket if dukakis wins the nomination 
but he then added it is an option my constituency has earned 
the constituency i represent has earned its place at the top 
level of american politics he said 
in a reflective tone that he has adopted in the last days of the 
primary campaign jackson also said he has achieved key objectives 
of his presidential campaign 
the three objectives of my campaign have in some measure been 
addressed expand the party build a viable converging interest 
coalition and change national priorities he said 
to that extent we now have a tremendous sense of hope about the 
country which he said is changing for the better

vice president george bush saying 
hes ready for the real battle vowed to come out swinging in 
his match with democrat michael dukakis 
the massachusetts governor wrapped up his partys nomination 
tuesday night with returns from the final four primaries in 
california new jersey new mexico and montana 
for bush though tuesdays contests were just another round of 
uncontested races he locked up the delegates he needed for the 
republican nomination back in april 
the vice president who was flying back to washington overnight 
was meeting this morning with president reagan he planned to 
resume campaigning on thursday with two days of appearances in his 
adopted home state of texas 
at a victory rally here following runaway wins in the four 
primaries he said he was happy to see the primary season end 
this is the beginning of the real battle bush declared 
now well be going into the majorleague ballgame 
now that dukakis is the democratic nominee in all but name the 
vice president said contrasts between the two candidates will be 
highlighted 
thats the nice thing about getting the primary over with 
he said in an interview on nbctv i am ready on the issues 
recent polls have suggested bush trails dukakis but he brushed 
the surveys aside 
im fighting back im the underdog now he said in the nbc 
interview 
bush underscored that point in another primarynight interview 
this one on cbstv 
theres a perception problem perhaps on some of these early 
polls he said but ive been pounded out there without the 
benefit of having a horse race every tuesday 
bush has long complained that dukakis has been getting a round 
of favorable publicity every time he defeated jesse jackson in a 
primary while he was left out of the spotlight 
the issues for the fall are not in focus he said the 
differences between ourselves and gov dukakis are going to be very 
clear when the fall rolls around 
earlier the vice president said he would continue to move away 
from the president where they differ because i have to spell out 
my own identity in the fall presidential campaign 
bush has edged away from administration policy on issues from 
offshore oil drilling to negotiations with panamas manuel noriega

congress today passed a land reform 
law supporters say will improve the lives of millions of 
impoverished filipinos critics say the plan could fail unless it is 
implemented efficiently 
president corazon aquino who asked congress to enact land reform 
last july was expected to sign the bill by friday land reform was 
a chief promise during her 1986 election campaign against ousted 
president ferdinand marcos 
the measure gives landowners the choice of dividing their 
property among tenants or sharing profits with them it is expected 
to cost 70 billion and benefit 2 million farmers in this largely 
agricultural nation of 7100 islands land reform is also considered 
essential to defeating the 19yearold communist insurgency which 
has its main support in rural areas 
we are very pleased with the final bill said rep ramon 
mitra speaker of the house of representatives it is a measure 
that will change the lives of millions 
under the plan each landowner may retain 12 acres and an 
additional seven acres for each direct heir over age 15 who will 
till the land a landowner also has the option of sharing profits or 
giving tenants shares of stock instead of physically dividing the 
property 
all but one of the 19 senators present approved the bill late 
tuesday sen vicente paterno a landowner abstained the other 
four members left before the vote the 203member house of 
representatives later passed the measure by a vote of 15220 with 
four abstentions 
sen heherson alvarez a former agrarian reform minister who 
sponsored the legislation said it would bring democratization of 
the means of production 
rep jose cojuangco mrs aquinos younger brother voted in 
favor despite earlier objections to the plan 
there are a few sections that have to be amended but for the 
first time this bill will really accomplish a genuine land reform 
he said the presidents family owns a 14820acre sugar plantation 
in tarlac province north of manila 
rep bonifacio gillego sponsored the original house bill but 
withdrew after changes began he voted against the legislation today 
and told his colleagues they were foisting a grand deception on 
our people 
he said the plan would fail if the government does not provide 
credit expertise and other assistance to new landholders he also 
predicted communist rebels will oppose the plan 
they will try to expose it as bogus and not genuine not 
equitable gillego told the associated press therefore they 
will engage in a vigorous campaign so the burden is on the 
government to show it is not bogus 
gillego said farmers would oppose the profitsharing option and 
it might result in agrarian reform if you will through a 
revolution 
leftist farmers groups have said the bill favors landowners 
guillermo luz executive director of the influential makati 
business club said the governments skill in implementing the 
program will determine its success or failure 
the private sector will have to be involved especially with 
technical and management expertise and credit he said it will 
have to devise a system of agricultural credits in the countryside 
the bill also provides for the transfer to farm workers of tracts 
of public land greater than 2470 acres now leased to multinational 
corporations 
government lands will be the first distributed in the 10year 
program private holdings of more than 123 acres will be parceled 
out in the first four years and smaller holdings later owners of 
more than 123 acres will be compensated with 25 percent of the value 
in cash and those with less than 60 acres will be paid 35 percent in 
cash 
tax exemptions shares of stock in governmentowned or controlled 
corporations or land bank of the philippines bonds will make up the 
rest of the compensation 
officials say the program will be financed by foreign aid and 
assets of marcos and his allies that were seized on grounds they 
were illegally acquired 
marcos governed the philippines for 20 years but was driven from 
the country in february 1986 by a civilianmilitary uprising that 
brought mrs aquino to power 
the philippines has attempted about a dozen land reform programs 
in this century but they have largely failed due to lack of funds 
and resistance from landowners 
genuine land reform was among the demands of prosoviet huk 
rebels in the 1950s and early 1960s and is a principal goal of 
communist rebels who launched their current insurgency in 1968

independent religious activists are demanding that 
the russian orthodox church retract its past praise of josef v 
stalin and embrace the soviet unions new spirit of reforms 
they are urging the church to follow the lead of other soviet 
organizations that are reevaluating and condemning stalins 
dictatorship 
on tuesday nearly 100 religious dissidents from around the 
soviet union packed a moscow apartment for an unofficial threeday 
seminar on religious problems in the soviet union 
father gleb yakunin told reporters the church is at a crossroads 
its the responsibility of the church to announce which side 
it is on the side of perestroika or the side of stalinism he 
said a person cannot be renewed in his personal life unless he 
repents this is true of the church 
perestroika or restructuring is what mikhail s gorbachev 
calls his ambitious program of social and economic reforms 
church activists released copies of an appeal they sent to 
patriarch pimen the russian orthodox church leader asking that 
the church council condemn a 1949 letter it sent to stalin for his 
70th birthday basically canonizing the dictator 
the church told stalin it was forever grateful to you for your 
attentiveness to its needs 
so far the church has kept silent on stalin while many other 
soviets including gorbachev have sharply criticized the 
dictators purges which killed or exiled millions of people 
after stalin took power a law was passed in 1929 sharply 
restricting church activities the church faced its severest 
repression in the 1930s when cathedrals were demolished and other 
church property seized by the state 
yakunin and other religious activists met with reporters on the 
second day of the russian orthodox church local council in zagorsk 
northeast of moscow 
the council is at the center of celebrations of christianitys 
arrival 1000 years ago in russia 
yakunin was barred from performing religious rites from 1966 
until last year because of his criticism of church officials he 
also is a former political prisoner in august the church gave him 
a small parish near moscow 
the dissidents criticized the selection of delegates for the 
church council in zagorsk and the amount of money being spent on 
the millennium celebration 
ceremonies scheduled at moscows bolshoi theater threaten to 
turn the event in a pompous theatrical action yakunin said 
each day of the weeklong celebration costs about 16 million 
he said

government is mishandling its investigations of the killings of 
reporters 25 of whom have been slain in mexico in the past six 
years

awards and attended the luncheon as his last official activity 
before departing for new york where he is to address the un 
general assembly 
fernando pineda president of the liberal union of democratic 
journalists said he did not attend the luncheon because on this 
june 7 there is nothing to celebrate 
the union and other journalists associations in mexico complain 
that the government has bungled investigations into the slayings of 
the 25 journalists killed during the past six years 
most recently columnist hector felix miranda of the outspoken 
weekly zeta in the northwestern border city of tijuana was fatally 
shot april 20 police believe the man arrested may 1 may have been 
a triggerman acting for others 
the interior department on friday issued an unusually detailed 
80page report on the cases 
the report says de la madrid had put into practice the actions 
needed to guarantee free exercise without any restriction of the 
freedom of the press throughout his sixyear term starting in 
december 1982

interior department to pursue its investigations into cases of 
violence against mexican reporters to better protect the life and 
patrimony of journalists and the rights of the press

jesse jackson the unvanquished loser is 
promising a postprimary workout for michael dukakis that could put 
the democratic nominee in prime condition for his general election 
bout with george bush 
but dukakis cant afford a messy convention or other major 
missteps as the next six weeks test his mettle as a negotiator and a 
leader 
dukakis has the 1988 democratic presidential nomination firmly in 
hand after four big victories on tuesdays final round of 1988 
primaries jackson cant shake dukakiss grip on the nominating 
majority at the atlanta convention 
but he has plenty of time to pressure dukakis before and during 
the democratic national convention in atlanta in july 
the intensely determined massachusetts governor expects some 
fireworks from the fiery preacher indeed he seems almost to be 
welcoming them 
we may have a contest or two we may have a floor fight or 
two dukakis said in los angeles on tuesday there may be some 
issues that go to the floor i dont see any great divisions within 
our party 
jackson promised to take the south african issue to the 
convention floor if the party platform does not measure up to his 
standard of denouncing of that apartheid regime as terrorist 
dukakis almost invited the fight tuesday night by saying that 
label is meaningless 
his attitude toward possible floor fights at the convention is a 
healthy one for two reasons 
one floor fights are not necessarily bad 
a little drama and conflict makes good television in what could 
otherwise be a very dull four days in july in atlanta but 
outofcontrol ideological spats have marred past democratic 
conventions making many party professionals anxious to avoid them 
second the more dukakis refuses to give into pressure from the 
left wing of the democratic party on the issues the better he is 
positioned to ward off attacks from republican george bush 
in a similar way jackson stepped up the pressure on the vice 
presidential spot tuesday even as the massachusetts governor was 
crushing him in primaries in california montana new jersey and new 
mexico 
jackson declared flatly he deserves consideration for the 
nomination a point dukakis has agreed with even though he hasnt 
made up his mind about an offer 
ive not yet made that decision but i have certainly earned 
consideration jackson said after the votes were tallied tuesday 
and the civil rights leader added a new twist to his demands 
that dukakis balance his ticket ideologically with a liberal 
mr dukakis said in many ways he is more conservative than 
george bush jackson said he has the right to express his point 
of viewso he is a fiscal conservative 
it means the ticket must be balanced therefore with a 
progressive 
such a characterization cannot help but please the liberal 
massachusetts governor if only privately 
when the leading proponent of the democratic partys left wing 
calls you a conservative it is a useful antidote to the attacks 
from bush 
the republican nomineetobe has been trying mightily in the past 
two months to paint dukakis as a farout liberal as a george 
mcgovern dove on defense and a walter mondale taxraiser in budget 
matters 
such attacks are designed to frame the general election race in a 
straightforward liberalconservative terms a structure dukakis 
would like to forget about as he talks of change and efficient 
management of government without reference to ideology 
there are substantial pitfalls for dukakis in this shortterm 
contest of wills with jackson 
he must of course avoid alienating jackson or his constituents 
as the battles continue through atlanta he needs the enthusiastic 
support of jacksons backers and a big turnout from them on nov 8 
if he is beat bush 
any refusal to talk to jackson to listen at length to his 
concerns would fly in the face of his demand that his supporters 
must be heard respectfully at every level in the party 
and any direct attacks on jackson by dukakis would cause problems 
in the fall 
unlike some other democratic hopefuls dukakis also avoided much 
criticism of jackson something the civil rights leader noted in 
praising dukakis for running a campaign free of demagoguery and 
attacks 
but dukakis has given every indication of understanding the need 
to consult with jackson to talk with him and to meet with him 
its a long way to atlanta for dukakis and jackson 
but this political odd couple may be working out their 
differences in ways that could ultimately contribute to a goal both 
share a goal which can now be stated as putting dukakis in the 
white house in january 1989

michael dukakis clinched the democratic presidential nomination 
with a fourstate flourish tuesday night and forecast a golden 
opportunity to win the white house in 1988 republican george bush 
labeled himself the underdog heading into the fall campaign but 
said im fighting back 
dukakis dominated jesse jackson coast to coast on the final night 
of a grueling democratic primary marathon he was winning primaries 
in new jersey montana new mexico and california by margins of 
better than 2to1 
the threeterm massachusetts governor began the night needing 
roughly 150 elegates to achieve a mathematical lock on the 
nomination and he wound up with about 200 more than that he was 
winning more than 131 in new jersey montana and new mexico 
combined and early returns from california showed him ahead for 
more than 200 delegates 
dukakis emerged as the winner of the grueling democratic primary 
marathon and owner of a lead over bush in the nationwide public 
opinion polls but bush who wrapped up the gop nomination six weeks 
ago holds formidable electoral college advantages in the south and 
west and republicans have won four of the last five presidential 
elections 
thus the prospect is for a close general election and bush and 
dukakis seemed to share an eagerness to begin 
my friends what a golden opportunity this is for us dukakis 
said as he savored his nominating triumph in a speech in california 
he pledged to use his campaign to stand up for factory workers 
thrown out of their jobs with no warning to ease the burden of 
families hit by medical bills and to share the rage of those 
living in neighborhoods threatened by drugs 
every day between now and november the american people will 
want to hear how we intend to build a strong and vibrant future for 
our country they arent interested in slashing attacks they want 
to judge our positive ideas for change he said 
bush posted uncontested primary victories in all four states and 
said i think i can overcome this deficit in the polls he 
said im fighting back im the underdog now 
the vice president agreed there was no need for a negative 
nasty campaign 
in a television interview he also likened dukakis to walter f 
mondale the landslide democratic loser in 1984 for refusing to 
rule out a tax increase ill rule it out bush said in an 
interview with cbs and rely on a spending freeze to reduce the 
deficit 
he decried the gloom and doom he said was emanating from the 
democrats and said the polls would change as he begins to establish 
his own political identity when we get through in the fall 
talking about opportunity and peace and numbers of jobs and how much 
better things are and what ill do to keep it that way i think i 
can overcome that deficit he said 
jackson offered dukakis congratulations for running a race free 
of demagoguery and attacks but said he would offer no endorsement 
before the nominating convention in atlanta next month 
i salute him for a fine campaign we have shown it is 
possible to compete without conflict and differ without division 
jackson said 
he said he hadnt yet decided if he would accept an offer to be 
dukakis vice presidential running mate an offer that some dukakis 
aides view as extremely unlikely but i have certainly earned 
consideration jackson added 
both dukakis and bush will spend the next several weeks doing 
what they can to assure party unity plan their nominating 
conventions and select vice presidential running mates 
dukakis said he wasnt going to rule anybody in or out at 
this point in his search for a ticket mate and that included 
jackson he can expect a possible floor fight from his last 
democratic primary rival on a handful of issues but he said as he 
savored his nominating triumph were going to go to atlanta site 
of the democratic convention united were going to come out of 
atlanta united 
jackson routed in the four final primaries of the year already 
was turning his attention to the next phase of a remarkable 
campaign talk of the vice presidential nomination convention 
platform issues and changes in party rules affecting future 
campaigns was in the air even before the polling places opened to 
voters on the final primary day of the year 
bush already has been endorsed by the men he defeated for the 
nomination and will attend the first of five gop unity dinners 
later this week in denver

a successful launch rehearsal that 
ended with a mock emergency landing will make it easier to conduct 
the real thing when space shuttle flights resume nasa officials 
say 
the launch team here flight controllers in houston and rescue 
weather safety and other support crews on tuesday practiced the 
final three hours of a countdown followed by a shuttle liftoff 
on a flight cut short minutes later when computers simulated the 
failure of two main engines 
three astronauts flying the mission in a houston simulator 
reacted swiftly to the planned failure and guided themselves 
through a tricky set of manauevers to a safe landing on a 
runway just 3 miles from the kennedy space center launch pad 
the exercise evaluated hundreds of management procedural 
hardware and software changes that are the result of the explosion 
that destroyed challenger and its sevenmember crew on jan 28 
1986 most of the changes are aimed at improved safety 
it was the most comprehensive rehearsal yet for the first 
postchallenger flight scheduled for late august 
under the new management structure astronaut bob crippen 
deputy director of shuttle launch operations will make the final 
decision on whether to launch a shuttle 
he and his main adviser launch director bob sieck had ample 
oportunity to exercise their judgments tuesday as intentional 
electrical communications and other problems were built into the 
countdown to give controllers experience in resolving them 
crippen who flew on four shuttle missions said the test showed 
some areas of problemsolving that needed to be improved but all 
in all it was an excellent exercise 
in houston lee briscoe a flight director who helped coordinate 
the simulation said it increased the confidence of the 
management team 
we exercised the whole team he said communications were 
good the data flow was good i was pleased with the way it went 
many milestones still must be passed before the shuttle 
discovery makes the next flight the spaceship is undergoing final 
checks here after an extensive overhaul of several systems and is 
scheduled to be mated next week with its two solid fuel booster 
rockets and external fuel tank 
transfer to the launch pad is planned june 27 with a 
testfiring of the three main engines scheduled there on july 19 
two more tests of the redesigned booster rockets are scheduled 
for june 10 and july 26 at the morton thiokol plant in utah a 
faulty joint in one rocket was blamed for the challenger accident

democrat michael dukakis won support in the 
california and new jersey primaries from two groups whose support 
will be crucial in the november election reagan democrats and 
jesse jackson backers 
dukakis wrapped up his partys nomination with victories tuesday 
in the two states along with contests in montana and new mexico 
exit polls after the races showed dukakis maintaining the broad 
ideological appeal he has maintained throughout the later 
primaries he even was rated favorably by a sizable share of 
republicans 
the massachusetts governor remained somewhat illdefined in the 
eyes of voters abc news found that nearly a quarter of the 
democrats in both states were not sure where to place him 
ideologically analysts said that could prove a plus or a minus 
its an indication hes run a moderate campaign said abc 
pollster john brennan it also indicates people havent 
scrutinized him closely hes all things to all people 
while dukakis paints himself as a moderate therefore the 
republicans may find an opening to call him a liberal 
still the polls contained chiefly good news for dukakis as he 
looks ahead to november 
cbs newsnew york times polls said about a quarter of the 
democratic primary voters in both states supported president reagan 
in 1984 and nearly twothirds of them favored dukakis over george 
bush this year 
at the same time a majority of the democrats who supported 
jackson said they would back dukakis over bush for president and 
sizable shares of republicans and jackson voters alike viewed 
dukakis favorably 
republicans are not turned off by dukakis said ia lewis 
pollster for the los angeles times across the political spectrum 
he added look at jackson voters they are not unfavorable to 
dukakis so it wont be so hard for them to bind up their wounds 
thirtysix percent of jacksons voters in the los angeles times 
poll had a favorable opinion of dukakis to 32 percent unfavorable 
and 32 percent with no opinion in the 1984 and 1980 democratic 
primaries in california backers of the losers were far more 
antagonistic toward the winners lewis noted 
abc and cbstimes polls found that more than 60 percent of 
jacksons supporters in both states said they would vote for 
dukakis over bush in november although as many as 30 percent said 
they would not vote abc poll analyst doug muzzio said disappointed 
primary voters historically turn out in greater numbers in november 
than they indicate in the spring 
among republicans the la times poll said 29 percent had a 
favorable opinion of dukakis to 40 percent unfavorable and 31 
percent with no opinion lewis said favorable ratings usually are 
far lower for an opposing partys candidate 
abc poll results from new jersey said dukakis continued to 
appeal to democrats across the ideological spectrum he won 
majorities of liberals moderates and conservatives and 56 percent 
of all democrats said his views were just about right as 
opposed to too liberal or too conservative 
dukakis scored somewhat less strongly in california where 49 
percent of democrats rated his views just about right liberals 
dominate the state party and 19 percent of the democrats rated 
dukakis too conservative that group voted overwhelmingly for 
jackson 
dukakis also won more committed support in new jersey where the 
cbstimes poll found that 54 percent of his voters backed him 
strongly more than in most earlier races in california 49 
percent of dukakis supporters said they had some reservations about 
him to 38 percent who were strong 
voters in both states cited experience and strong leadership as 
their chief reasons for supporting dukakis areas in which he has 
not been rated as strongly in the past said cbs pollster keating 
holland he said dukakis greater strength in new jersey could 
reflect a regional bias for a fellow northeasterner 
the exit polls showed a continuing racial division in the 
democratic vote jackson won about a quarter of the white vote in 
california one of his best showings among whites but only 9 
percent in new jersey one of his worst showings with whites he 
got more than 90 percent of the black vote in both states 
abcs polls had a margin of sampling error of five percentage 
points the cbstimes poll had a fourpoint margin the la times 
poll three points nbcs two points

special correspondent with an annual salary of about 1 million 
two former cbs news presidents van gordon sauter and edward m

up to 10 new plays by established american 
playwrights could make it to new york within the next two years 
under an ambitious plan developed by three producers and a major 
broadway theater owner 
the american playwrights project will commission works from such 
writers as christopher durang david henry hwang marsha norman 
terrence mcnally david rabe wendy wasserstein and four more 
authors to be named later 
the project financed at 200000 was announced tuesday by 
producers james b freydberg max weitzenhoffer and stephen graham 
and jujamcyn theaters which owns five broadway playhouses 
i was concerned about the fact that there were fewer american 
plays on broadway than any other season said freydberg producer 
of lanford wilsons burn this one of only six american plays 
that opened on broadway during the 198788 season 
we have formed the american playwrights project for a simple 
reason to get product he said but added that the project will 
not own an option on these works and will not influence what 
happens to them artistically 
for example there may be several readings of a play and then 
it would go to a regional theater if they were interested and from 
there the play might travel to new york said freydberg 
but there is no guarantee a show will come to broadway he 
said there is no guarantee that we would end up producing it if 
we didnt we would have a small interest in the show for the 
purpose of recouping the cost of the commission which we would 
then use to commission somebody else 
each of the playwrights will receive appromimately 15000 in 
commissions 
many of the details are still be worked out said hwang whose 
m butterfly won a tony award on sunday as best play of the 
broadway season 
i see it as an intention to work together at this point he 
said 
miss wasserstein author of the offbroadway hit isnt it 
romantic said she was approached about the project by several 
people including rocco landesman president of jujamcyn she said 
she had agreed to it although no contracts have been signed 
i always find commissions useful because they make you write 
the play she said they said we should come in and give them a 
general idea of what we are going to write but its pretty much 
anything i think thats whats appealing about it

a federal judge has ordered the government to 
grant visas to nicaraguas interior minister and three others 
barred from entering the country because of their membership in 
communist or communistaffiliated groups 
us district judge harold h greene reversed an earlier finding 
that had been set aside by a federal appeals court ruling on 
tuesday that nicaraguan interior minister tomas borge two cuban 
officials and a former italian senator should be admitted to accept 
speaking engagements at the invitation of us citizens 
greene said the state department had violated the 1952 
immigration and nationality act by denying the four visas simply 
because the applicants were members of communist or 
communistaffiliated organizations 
the american civil liberties union argued that to bar someone 
the law requires the state department to determine that an aliens 
proposed activities during the visit as opposed to political 
affiliations would endanger us interests

thirtythree nations have 
recommended lifting a ban on mineral exploitation of antarctica 
believed to be rich in gold oil coal and other resources 
approval of a 100page document called the antarctic minerals 
convention came despite the objections of environmentalists at a 
monthlong conference that ended last week 
chris beeby new zealands deputy secretary of foreign affairs 
and chairman of the conference said the convention approved 
thursday offers the strongest protection possible for the 
unspoiled antarctic environment 
but the environmental group greenpeace and other 
nongovernmental groups included in the discussions called the 
environmental safeguards inadequate 
the conventions provisions include creating an antarctic 
minerals resource commission to oversee the regions development 
the united states which was represented at the meeting 
estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleum 
reserves 
the convention must now be ratified by a minimum of 16 of the 
antarctic treatys 20 members including the seven with land claims 
in antarctica before it would take effect 
beeby predicted the convention will go down in antarctic 
history as the most important political development regarding the 
regulation of antarctica since the antarctic treaty itself was 
adopted in 1959 the treaty regulates activities in antarctica 
conservationists who pushed to have the region protected as a 
world park disagreed 
greenpeace spokesman roger wilson said the agreement was reached 
only by bludgeoning environmentally minded nations into 
submission 
he said the convention looked good on paper but would not 
protect the environment in practice 
beeby said he did not think exploitation of resources will begin 
soon 
a moratorium on mineral development has existed since 1977 and 
will remain until the convention is ratified delegates said 
antarctica is double the size of the united states countries 
with land claims are australia britain new zealand chile 
norway argentina and france

thousands of chanting demonstrators 
took to the streets of the capital to protest a new law declaring 
islam the state religion of bangladesh 
the demonstrators supporters of opposition political parties 
labor groups and students burned two trucks and stoned seven 
government buses and a police jeep as they marched through dhaka 
tuesday night witnesses said 
several thousand security personnel were posted at key points 
but did not interfere with the demonstrators there were no reports 
of injuries or arrests 
parliament approved the bill by a 254to0 vote tuesday after 15 
opposition lawmakers walked out president hussain muhammad 
ershads jatiya party holds 252 of the assemblys 300 seats and 
two independents joined them in the vote 
nearly 90 percent of bangladeshs 105 million people are 
moslems but the bill had drawn considerable criticism from 
opposition parties womens groups and minority christian hindu 
and buddhist religions 
opposition leader khaleda zia said in a statement after the vote 
tuesday the illegal law bringing about basic change in the 
constitution undermining the independence of the judiciary and 
giving birth to communalism is nothing but a farreaching 
conspiracy to divide the nation 
the present parliament was elected march 3 in elections largely 
boycotted by the nations 48 million voters mrs zia called the 
assembly illegal and said it had no right to transact 
legislative business 
nirmal sen head of the alliance of five parties said the law 
would divide the nation between moslems and nonmoslems 
but syed deedar bakht the jatiya whip in parliament said the 
law would ensure communal harmony and encourage the 
nonmoslems to follow their faiths in total freedom 
i find no reason for the womenfolk to worry about the law as 
under islam both men and women are treated with greater kindness 
in islam than in any other religion he said in an interview 
the bill amends the constitution to insert the sentence the 
religion of the republic is islam but other religions may be 
practiced in peace and harmony 
before the bill was passed prime minister maudud ahmed told 
parliament the measure was needed to free islam from the hands of 
fundamentalists and the traders of religion he tried to assure 
minority groups they need not fear the amendment 
a senior law ministry official said there were no plans to 
rewrite the nations anglosaxonbased civil law to make it comply 
with religious law and a cabinet miniser said there was no need to 
but maleka begum secretary general of the womens council said 
the law was against the concept of the war of liberation she 
said moslem fundamentalists would use it to force the 
introduction of puritan islamic laws

a costly new longterm home health care plan 
arrives on the house floor against the backdrop of a coming 
election and a series of polls indicating public desire for such a 
program 
the home care bill is championed by rep claude pepper dfla 
who said tuesday he had been trying for 50 years to help fill a 
total vacuum in the area of longterm care 
but two spurned committee chairmen whose panels never got a 
chance to review the bill spearheaded an effort to block its 
consideration on the house floor today 
we should not allow the rules of the house to be manipulated 
to satisfy the popular issue of the moment ways and means 
committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill said tuesday in a 
letter to his colleagues 
peppers plan would expand medicare to include longterm home 
care benefits for anyone of any age who is chronically ill or cant 
perform tasks of daily living 
sen paul simon dill the senate sponsor of the pepper bill 
said 30 percent of the people in nursing homes would not have to be 
there if home services were available 
were going to have an explosion in the demand for longterm 
care and we ought to face up to it now he said at a news 
conference tuesday with pepper and others 
the congressional budget office estimates the home care program 
would cost nearly 28 billion over five years backers say it would 
be paid for by imposing the medicare payroll tax on income above 
45000 which is currently exempt but opponents are skeptical 
saying the cost could balloon out of control 
ordinarily the house ways and means committee and the energy 
and commerce committee would have worked on the pepper bill before 
it reached the floor 
but under a special arrangement between pepper and house speaker 
jim wright pepper agreed not to offer his home care plan as an 
amendment to an already controversial catastrophic health bill 
dealing with the cost of acute illness in return wright agreed to 
let him have a floor vote on his bill 
the move allowed the bill to bypass rostenkowskis committee and 
the energy and commerce panel led by rep john dingell dmich 
republican and democratic opponents though lauding the intent 
of peppers bill said they had problems with the way it got to the 
house floor its cost its lack of a nursing home component and 
the absence of agencies capable of administering the plan 
history has demonstrated that such a big program cannot be put 
in place quickly without encouraging inept or fraudulent 
management rostenkowski said he also said cbo estimates show 
the program would face an annual deficit within five years 
in a dear colleague letter dated today pepper and his 
cosponsor rep edward roybal dcalif said the cost and 
procedural questions were bogus reasons to oppose their bill 
they said no procedural rules were violated and the bill 
contains a cap on costs while they did not mention their inhouse 
opponents they condemned outside groups fighting the bill 
particularly the insurance industry as serving their own narrow 
selfinterest not the american peoples interest 
pepper assembled a group of influential lawmakers at a 
rallythetroops news conference tuesday among them were sen 
edward kennedy chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
committee and rep henry waxman chairman of the energy and 
commerce health subcommittee 
the political pressure on representatives was enormous polls 
this year have shown public support for a new government program 
for longterm care and every member of the house is up for 
reelection in five months 
in addition pepper 87 a nationally known champion of the 
elderly has personally campaigned on behalf of many members and 
his bill was the only shot at a longterm care program of any kind 
in the 100th congress 
rostenkowski suggested that pepper and wright had put lawmakers 
in an untenable position he said the committee system protects 
members from being forced to vote on popularappearing proposals 
that may ultimately prove to be embarrassing 
pepper chairman of the powerful rules committee that schedules 
floor action scheduled his own bill after reaching the agreement 
with wright but he dismissed the idea that he was setting a bad 
precedent that could become routine the rules committee is not 
going to run rampant over anybody he said

more than half those who were informed in 
community screening programs that their cholesterol levels were 
high contacted a doctor within two months an encouraging sign for 
such programs a study says 
that showed very good followup for the amount of time that had 
passed said reagan bradford director of the oklahoma lipid 
research clinic in oklahoma city 
bradford spoke tuesday at a symposium on cholesterol sponsored 
by the american medical association 
his results came from about 13000 people who went through 
pinprick blood tests for cholesterol at shopping malls schools 
and other public places 
about 70 percent of those who had seen a doctor received 
confirmation that their levels were high and had started a diet 
prescribed by the physician bradford said 
other studies suggest that perhaps 40 percent of those who go 
through such screening will be told to see a doctor he said 
also at the symposium george gallup jr said a new poll found 
that 31 percent of adolescents said they were greatly concerned 
about heart disease or a heart attack but their eating habits were 
about the same as those who did not express such concern the 
pollster said 
apparently they believe other things are more important in life 
than controlling cholesterol intake he said and adolescents 
appear to have only limited knowledge about how to avoid 
cholesterol in the diet he said 
his organization polled 375 adolescents ages 12 to 17 from 
march 28 to april 10 findings should be accurate within 5 
percentage points the organization said 
among its findings about the youths 
seventy percent knew that diet can reduce blood cholesterol 
levels ninetythree percent said it was very or fairly 
important for young people to control their cholesterol intake 
about 90 percent correctly identified fried foods and butter 
as contributing to high cholesterol levels only 31 percent 
correctly put ice cream in that category 
some 24 percent said they avoid fried foods of those who said 
they avoid some foods because of cholesterol about half cited 
fried foods and 30 percent named butter 
twentythree percent overall said they eat eggs which contain 
cholesterol for breakfast three or more times a week 
fiftynine percent said they eat a good deal of beef 
the poll was commissioned by the pharmaceutical company merck 
sharpe and dohme

powerful telescopes 
it is perfect engineer edward mannery said tuesday after 
the lid was taken off a special furnace and he examined the glass 
blank which will be ground and polished into a telescope mirror 
it couldnt be better at this point said astronomer roger 
angel who heads the steward observatory mirror laboratory at the 
university of arizona and devised the new process 
the blank was spuncast six weeks ago using centrifugal force 
then gradually cooled until the furnace was shut off last weekend 
at 35 meters about 11 feet wide it is the largest made with 
the new method 
the finished mirror will go into a telescope being built in the 
sacramento mountains near sun spot nm by the astrophysical 
research consortium 
consortium members are the university of chicago the university 
of washington princeton university new mexico state university 
and washington state university 
mannery a university of washington engineer representing the 
consortium measured the thickness of the blanks surface with an 
electronic device as others inspected the glass for bubbles or 
other flaws 
if nothing went wrong we expected the face plate thickness to 
be 175 inches mannery said its just the thickness it was 
supposed to be 
he said the glass also appears to have an exceptionally low 
number of the bubbles that form during casting 
in the next two or three weeks well gradually unmold this 
glass and i would say probably in about three weeks well have 
gotten right deep into it and i think well know really what weve 
got there angel said 
the blanks surface which will be ground and polished by a 
tucson optical company is nearly half an inch over the thickness 
needed 
in about a week a special crane called a whiffletree will lift 
the blank from the furnace and about 4000 pounds of molding 
material used to create the hollow honeycomb support structure will 
be removed angel said 
the mirror is very fragile at this point he said 
explaining that small cracks caused by the mold have the potential 
for becoming a big crack 
many astronomers hope the process can be used to build strong 
lightweight mirrors that are more powerful because they have more 
deeply curved surfaces 
this translates to great savings in time and money because the 
new telescopes can be housed in smaller buildings angel and other 
proponents say 
angel said another 35meter mirror will be cast for another 
consortium later this year 
other commitments include two mirrors 26 feet wide for a 
binocularlike telescope called the columbus project that project 
involves arizona and chicago universities ohio state university 
and italian astronomers

brain lesion and may have two others spetzler said the cancer 
started in a lung spread to the brain and could develop elsewhere 
dr leslie sheeler of the cleveland clinic wrote on may 26 that 
the prognosis for the type of cancer presser has is in general 
very poor the expected survival is something like six months 
mr presser is quite impaired mentally sheeler wrote he 
has virtually no shortterm memory 
spetzler responding to questions from lynch confirmed 
sheelers diagnosis he said however that if presser continues 
his slow improvement a review in four to six months may show him 
competent to stand trial 
white called spetzler at the request of prosecutor william lynch

participating in a 700000 payroll padding scheme at teamsters

defense secretary frank carlucci today 
accused north korea of trying to disrupt the olympic games and said 
the united states would beef up its military forces to stop any 
threat 
let me assure you that we will do all we can to help ensure 
the security of the 1988 summer olympics games he said 
communist north korea continues to threaten peace on the divided 
korean peninsula by refusing to work with south korea to defuse the 
tension carlucci said 
it is most unfortunate that the north continues its 
troublemaking role and remains unwilling to make the simple 
concessions necessary to bring about a reduction in tensions on the 
peninsula he said 
carlucci gave the assurance to south korean defense officials at 
the start of the 20th annual ussouth korea security conference 
to discuss mutual defense 
south korea defense minister oh jabok also stressed the north 
korean threat to the south and said the olympics was adding to the 
tension 
with the danger of their scheme to disrupt the coming olympics 
remaining undiminished military tension between south and north on 
the peninsla continues thus posing a grave threat to the stability 
of northeast asia he said 
us and south korean delegates agreed during the talks to build 
up their early warning systems to detect any possible north korean 
military threat up to three us navy aircraft carriers will help 
provide security for the games officials said 
north korea is demanding to cohost the olympics the 
international olympic committee and south korea have rejected the 
demand saying the games are awarded to a single city 
the two koreas divided since 1945 are bitter opponents that 
have clashed repeatedly the united states has about 42000 us 
troops based in the south under a mutual defense pact 
after meeting with oh carlucci had lunch with president roh 
taewoo and was awarded the order of national security his 
scheduled visits later in the day with frontline american and south 
korean troops were canceled due to bad weather officials said

a jury has ruled that 10 former residents of 
times beach a town destroyed by toxic waste contamination had not 
been harmed by contact with dioxinlaced oil used to spray roads in 
the early 1970s 
the circuit court jury deliberated a day before returning a 
verdict tuesday in favor of independent petrochemical corp of st 
louis and the nowdefunct northeastern pharmaceutical and chemical 
co of verona 
the companies along with syntex usa and syntex agribusiness of 
palo alto calif had been sued by former times beach residents in 
an attempt to recover damages for health problems they said were 
caused by their exposure to dioxin 
syntex pulled out of the case without explanation last week a 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that syntex had 
settled out of court for 14 million to be divided among 1230 
claims in missouri 
lawyers for syntex declined to confirm or deny tuesday that a 
settlement had been reached 
the eight cases in the trial involving 10 people were chosen 
by judge michael j hart as test cases from among 184 claims filed 
by former times beach residents 
the trial was designed to provide guidelines for attorneys on 
both sides so that future trials could be handled in as short a 
time as possible hart said 
edwin l noel an attorney for syntex said he hoped the jurys 
verdict would set a precedent for dioxin claims 
i think this will serve as a bellwether for those cases he 
said the verdict validated defense arguments that this level of 
exposure to dioxin is not cause for alarm he said 
ted perryman who represented northeastern pharmaceutical said 
the verdict was a response to the medical case that we put on 
the jury simply believed that these people werent injured by 
dioxin 
jurors interviewed after the verdict agreed with that assessment 
the bottom line was that over the last seven months there 
was no evidence to indicate health damage said juror alvia 
chambers 43 she said the jury believed that complaints cited by 
the plaintiffs such as headaches and heart problems had not been 
conclusively linked to dioxin 
sources close to the case which began in november said more 
than 2200 claims of harmful dioxin exposure were still pending 
those claims arose from exposure to dioxin in times beach and other 
sites 
dioxin is a toxic byproduct of the manufacture of herbicides and 
other chlorine compounds it has been linked to cancer in animals 
and in humans and has been associated with liver and immune system 
disorders and a serious skin condition called chloracne 
in 1982 the environmental protection agency bought out homes 
and property in times beach because of dioxin contamination caused 
when waste oil tainted with the chemical was sprayed on streets and 
other areas to control dust in the early 1970s 
times beach officially ceased to exist in 1985 when its alderman 
voted to disincorporate the town of 2240 residents 
donald l schlapprizi an attorney for the plaintiffs said he 
was disappointed by the verdict 
its depressing that with all of the effort you go down in 
flames he said 
attorneys for the plaintiffs were planning a strategy to deal 
with tuesdays defeat which could include a request for a new 
trial 
the dioxin that contaminated times beach was produced by syntex 
at a plant in verona in southwestern missouri syntex later 
transferred to northeastern pharmaceutical tanks that reportedly 
contained the dioxinlaced waste 
northeastern contracted with international petrochemical for 
removal of the waste oil international then contracted with a 
waste hauler to truck the oil from verona the hauler later mixed 
the waste with other waste oil and sprayed it on unpaved roads to 
control dust

the soviet union is discussing working with 
american and other foreign interests to develop vast natural gas 
fields in its arctic siberian and other regions a top soviet 
official says 
joint venture agreements are not signed yet but they are in 
the works soviet gas industry minister victor s chernomyrdin 
told reporters on tuesday at the 17th world gas conference 
he declined to give other details or name the potential foreign 
partners saying premature disclosure could upset the negotiations 
or ruin their business 
earlier tuesday the minister said in a speech to the conference 
that the 1986 disaster at the soviet unions chernobyl nuclear 
power plant has prompted increased use of gas and other fuels to 
make electricity 
chernobyl made it necessary to somewhat limit the production 
of electricity at the nuclear power plants and other kinds of 
power stations have taken on greater loads he said 
chernobyl and other environmental concerns led to huge increases 
in gas production and consumption the past three years in the 
soviet union now the worlds largest natural gas producer the 
minister said from 1984 to 1987 he said soviet gas production 
rose from 5847 billion to 7274 billion cubic meters and 
consumption from 4628 billion to 568 billion cubic meters 
gas exports have increased more than 20fold in the past 15 
years he said dutch gas industry leader ahp grotens told the 
conference western europe nations import 60 billion cubic feet of 
soviet gas annually 
chernomyrdin told reporters that terms of joint ventures are 
still being negotiated but that the soviets will insist on 
retaining majority ownership in any project 
the soviet union seeks foreign collaboration to acquire high 
technology for vast production increases planned for the 21st 
century the minister said 
the soviets face daunting engineering problems in some remote 
and frigid egions he said 
six lengthy pipelines will be needed under the normallyfrozen 
gulf of baidarak for instance to link the huge yamal peninsula on 
the arctic ocean to the rest of the country he said one field on 
the tundra peninsula could yield 200 billion cubic meters of 
natural gas annually by 1990 he said

the ruling politburo has called on local communist 
party committees to submit grassroots proposals to this months 
crucial national party conference the official tass news agency 
reported today 
the move apparently aims to sidestep middlelevel bureaucrats 
who oppose mikhail s gorbachevs ambitious program for economic 
and social reform 
the soviet leader seeks through reform to limit the power and 
privilege of the entrenched bureaucracy 
the first national communist party conference in 47 years to 
begin on june 28 is expected to consolidate political changes 
backed by gorbachev including limits on terms for party officials 
the politburo in a special monday meeting instructed local 
party organizations to collect incoming proposals from the 
grassroots to make sure they will be taken into account when the 
conference discusses the issues on its agenda and be reflected in 
its decisions tass said 
the 13member ruling body in a communique carried by tass said 
most of those suggestions focus on ways of continuing to 
democratize party and public affairs and broadening glasnost 
gorbachevs term for greater openness on selected topics 
during the election process for delegates to the 19th party 
conference proponents of gorbachevs reform program charged that 
middleechelon bureaucrats were trying to seat more conservative 
party members 
by ensuring that grassroots proposals make it onto the 
conference agenda the politburo which includes gorbachev and 
other top kremlin leaders may limit the influence of party 
apparatchiks at the session 
the communique was published two days after the special meeting 
of the politburo which usually convenes on thursdays 
no reason was given for the delay 
at its monday session the politburo also expressed complete 
approval for the work done by mikhail gorbachev during the summit 
with president reagan last week the statement said 
politburo members expressed the conviction that the moscow 
talks have augmented possibilites for improving the overall 
atmosphere in the sovietamerican relationship and helped foster a 
favorable political climate in international relations in general

the united mine workers union ordered oneday walkouts by about 
7000 miners in alabama kentucky and tennessee to protest proposed 
changes in federal safety rules that one official says would 
cause big amounts of blood 
theyre going to have more trouble out of us than they ever 
thought of before they get this thing through umw district 19 
president joe phipps of middlesboro ky said tuesday 
the union called a oneday memorial period in each state 
this week so union members could attend hearings called by the 
federal mine safety and health administration on the rule changes 
which the umw says would increase fire hazards in underground mines 
one of the most controversial changes proposed by agency would 
eliminate the requirement that mines be evacuated when ventilation 
fans stop operating 
another proposal would allow mine operators to let conveyor belt 
passageways double as ventilation tunnels regulations now require 
that the two be separated to reduce the chances of fire 
special ventilation processes are needed in underground mines to 
disperse methane an explosive gas found in coal seams that 
accumulates as the coal is mined 
its like wearing a plastic bag over your head and carrying a 
stick of dynamite in your back pocket with a 3foot fuse on it 
said miner morgan bayless of tackett creek tenn thats the 
position were in 
if this goes into effect its going to cause big amounts of 
blood phipps said 
kentucky and tennessee miners observed their memorial period 
tuesday when the agency held its hearing in lexington ky the 
memorial period for alabama miners is scheduled for thursday when 
the agency will hold a hearing in birmingham 
union members are justifiably worried about the proposed 
changes since the agency has failed to address needed improvement 
in federal mine safety standards umw president richard trumka 
said tuesday 
trumka also indicated that the union will consider calling 
additional memorial periods on a casebycase basis to coincide 
with hearings in indiana colorado and west virginia later this 
month 
the agency says the revisions developed by the safety 
committees of three coal industry organizations representing the 
operators would update clarify and simplify its ventilation 
standards 
but joe main the umws safety director said the proposed rule 
changes save the mine operators over 7 million annually at the 
loss of safety protection for miners

health care is less accessible to adults of 
working age especially if they are poor than for the elderly a 
study has found 
even reasonably welloff adults who are young or middleage are 
less likely than older people to get medical care when they need it 
our findings suggest that whatever problems of access the 
elderly now face access to health care is markedly worse for 
workingage adults the researchers concluded 
they said this finding has major implications for national 
health policy since by general agreement medical insurance 
coverage for the elderly has been seriously deficient 
the study based on a 1986 nationwide telephone survey of 7633 
people was directed by dr rodney a hayward of the university of 
california los angeles it is being published in thursdays new 
england journal of medicine 
the survey found that insured workingage adults were nearly 
four times as likely as the elderly to need medical services but 
not receive them and they were more than three times as likely to 
have major financial difficulties because of illness 
among the insured workingage people those who were poor were 
four times as likely as betteroff people to have unfulfilled 
medical needs such problems also were more common among blacks and 
hispanics than among whites 
our findings suggest that neither the medicaid program nor the 
reported physician surplus has solved the problem of access to 
medical care for the poor and minorities the researchers wrote 
they said several factors may account for inadequate medical 
care of the working poor among them 
copayments deductibles and other insurance restrictions may 
deter poor people from seeking care 
some doctors may be unwilling to take care of people with 
medicaid coverage because the fees they receive are lower 
medical facilities may be scarce where they live or they have 
trouble getting to the doctor 
some people may be unwilling to seek care even when they need 
it 
some may avoid clinics and hospitals because of discrimination 
or bureaucratically unfriendly environments

famous book in american literature said the buyer manhattan 
book dealer james cummins its the book that every rare book 
seller hopes to get his hands on 
cummins said he was buying the book for a serious book 
collector from new york and was very pleased with the price 
which sothebys described as a record for a work of american 
literature 
sothebys had estimated the books value at 200000 to 
300000 the 198000 price includes the 10 percent commission 
that goes to sothebys 
the softcover book which contains the long title poem and nine 
shorter ones bears no reference to poe listing the author only as 
a bostonian although poe was born in boston he lived there 
only a few months before his parents moved to richmond va he 
lived in boston again for about eight weeks when tamerlane was 
published 
the work had been written about five years earlier when poe was 
12 or 13 years old there is no indication that a single copy of 
the book was ever sold and it never has been highly regarded by 
critics 
its value is considered historical more than literary since it 
is the first and rarest work by poe 
of the 11 other known copies of tamerlane all but one are 
owned by libraries or other institutions the only other one in 
private hands is on loan to the pierpont morgan library in new york 
also sold tuesday were four handwritten notebooks by nobel 
laureate saul bellow that comprised the rough draft of his 1970 
novel mr sammlers planet 
the notebooks believed to be the first archive of a major 
living authors published work to be auctioned during his life 
brought 66000

chicagos schools could point the way for others 
to improve says education secretary william bennett who has 
called the citys school system americas worst 
however bennett said tuesday that his view hadnt changed much 
from november when he called the citys public schools an 
education meltdown 
if its not the worst its too close to the worst 
bennett told reporters after a speech before the chicago council on 
foreign relations 
although he said the citys educational system was sad and 
very destructive bennett expressed optimism about the future 
there are radical proposals in the air this may be a 
revolutionary time said bennett who reiterated his support for 
a tuition voucher plan 
under the plan a school system would issue a voucher to parents 
for each child and the parents could then choose a public or a 
private school the schools would redeem vouchers for government 
money 
bennett said the system which is aimed at encouraging 
competition among schools has not been tried on a large scale in 
the united states he predicted that if a major test comes it 
would be in milwaukee or chicago 
if you tried it tried it honestly and fairly i would predict 
it would improve things dramatically he added 
whatever comes out of efforts to improve chicagos 
430000student system may be able to point the way for other 
school systems in the country bennett said 
city schools superintendent manford byrd jr called the plan 
just a diversion from funding the public school system the way it 
should be funded 
it is intended to deny students now in the system who tend to 
be minority and poor the type of funding they need to be served 
byrd said i think bennetts bashing of the public school 
system was only intended to make the climate right for the 
destruction of the system 
bennett also called for redistributing power to give parents and 
principals more say over school policies like curriculum and 
personnel 
he labeled the chicago school burueaucracy the blob and 
accused teacher unions of blocking reform in a system plagued by 
low test scores and high dropout rates 
statistics show nearly 45 percent of students who began school 
with the class of 1985 dropped out before graduating state figures 
also show that half of chicagos public high schools ranked in the 
bottom 1 percent of us schools for student scores on the american 
college test 
bennett called any reform that didnt redistribute power 
nonsense and said unions interested only in getting more and 
more for everyone may be hurt in the short run but positive 
changes in schools would help unions in the long run by raising the 
professional esteem of teachers he said 
bennett visited two chicago schools in march at the request of 
chicago teachers union he said afterward that intransigence of 
special interests such as unions remain the biggest obstacle to 
reform 
jacqueline vaughn president of the chicago union said then 
that cutbacks in government funds were the real culprits

soviet founder vladimir lenin misguidedly approved 
the use of terror and was also wrong to abolish all private 
property and create a system of forced labor camps a soviet 
literary journal says 
such criticism would have been forbidden before the era of 
glasnost or greater openness ushered in by mikhail s 
gorbachev 
still the overall tone of the article in the monthly novy mir 
is moderate and it concludes that lenin made the mistakes early 
on realized he was wrong and deserves praise 
vassily selyunin the author of the 30page article said that 
in the first few years after the bolsheviks took power in 1917 
lenin favored overly harsh measures for putting the countrys 
economy back on track 
selyunin wrote in the may edition of novy mir that lenin 
considered using violent means to shore up the economy as was done 
in the french revolution 
in november 1917 lenin declared that speculators were 
enemies of the people who should be shot when found according 
to selyunin speculation then meant anything outside government 
trade 
lenin also advocated another harsh measure limiting peasant 
families to only the bread they needed to make it to the next 
harvest selyunin wrote the penalty for violation was a minimum 
10year jail term 
the author says lenin might be excused for some of the harsh 
measures because the country was suffering severe hunger and 
destruction but the measures actually exacerbated the problems 
selyunin wrote 
in january 1918 lenin supported a decree that increased the 
space for prisoners so that class enemies could be 
incarcerated shortly thereafter a system of labor camps was set 
up and many people accused of economic crimes were imprisoned 
there selyunin wrote 
the article says the founder of the soviet secret police felix 
a dzerzhinksy also justified the use of labor camps 
the need for selfdefense was so great that we consciously 
could close our eyes to a series of mistakes if only to preserve 
the republic it says 
the criticism of dzerzhinsky also was unusual for the soviet 
press which generally extolls him as a hero who helped defend the 
country 
selyunin implied that lenin sowed the seeds for the extreme 
abuses of power for which his successor josef stalin has been 
condemned 
gorbachev has encouraged historians to take a more honest look 
at the countrys past the result has been numerous press articles 
books and films abhoring stalin who sent millions of people to 
their death through purges forced collectivization of agriculture 
and other repressions 
gorbachev has sharply criticized stalins economic policies 
under which the central government tightly controlled production of 
goods and services allowing for little individual initiative 
the criticism has extended to the era of stagnation under 
leonid i brezhnev who was communist party chief from 1964 to 1982 
but criticism of lenin has been offlimits he is still 
generally portrayed as a farsighted genius of unsurpassed wisdom 
the novy mir article took advantage of glasnost to break new 
ground in criticizing lenin 
the extremes of force as we see spread boundlessly first it 
is undertaken for repression of opponents of the revolution then 
it is turned against potential enemies the red terror and finally 
it becomes a means for solving purely economic tasks selyunin 
wrote 
but selunin said lenin began to realize he was wrong and he 
quotes the leader as saying the use of force was backfiring 
increasing civil unrest 
in march 1921 lenin made a midcourse correction and did away 
with a severe tax on peasants two months later he launched his 
new economic policy which allowed greater freedom in agriculture 
industry and trade 
selyunin credits lenins flexibility and the new policy with 
helping rid the country of bureaucracy which gorbachev has said is 
stifling some of his reforms

voters rejected an effort to carve 
out a new county in the high desert of southern california but 
desert dwellers vowed to continue their campaign for political 
independence 
the proposal to split a new mojave county out of san bernardino 
county was foundering 67 percent to 33 percent with 88 percent of 
precincts reporting 
san bernardino is the nations biggest county in area but 
mojave would have claimed that title with 18160 square miles 
stretching from the edge of los angeles eastern suburbs across the 
mojave desert to the arizona border 
residents of the area that would be mojave county favored the 
measure 60 percent to 40 percent countywide however the vote 
was 111283 against 54709 in favor 
secessionists saw the vote as vindication of their frequent 
complaints that the county government dominated by representatives 
of such rapidly urbanizing communities as san bernardino fontana 
and ontario doesnt understand their needs 
the message is very clear said tom pinard president of 
mojave county proponents we dont have the representation we 
pay the taxes and the services arent coming back 
if mojave county cant squeak through this time its far from 
dead said bob sagona secretary of the procounty group 
onecounty backers said voters feared that separation would 
leave both counties with insufficient tax base to support needed 
services 
the secession required both a simple majority vote of all county 
residents and a simple majority of residents of the region that 
would become mojave 
mojave which would have been the states first new county in 80 
years would have claimed 90 percent of the land in presentday san 
bernardino county but with a population of 205000 it would take 
just onefifth of the present countys residents 
left behind would have been the states secondsmallest county 
a narrow strip of the present county with a population of 11 
million that area is swelling with the overflow of population from 
los angeles and beset by smog and a rising crime rate

with 96 percent of 22718 precincts reporting early today 
3481311 voters or 68 percent disapproved proposition 69 while 
1628744 or 32 percent approved it 
larouche however indicated he would not drop his crusade 
aids is not going to go away he said in a statement 
released by his press spokeswoman dana scanlon who said larouche 
made the comments by phone from west germany if the voters vote 
against me then theyre wrong im right deadly right on this 
it was the second time in 18 months that larouches aids plan 
failed at the ballot box proposition 69 was a clone of his 
proposition 64 which in november 1986 was defeated by a slightly 
larger margin than tuesdays vote 
in contrast to the public controversy over proposition 64 the 
latest measure drew little debate and its defeat was widely 
expected 
if adopted it would have required health officials to report to 
the state health department the names of people with aids and those 
testing positive for antibodies to the virus 
the measure also would have added acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome to the states list of communicable diseases making those 
with the disease as well as carriers of the virus subject to 
possible quarantine 
the medical community and public health officials joined with 
homosexual and civil rights groups to denounce the proposition 
they said it would force aids victims underground and discourage 
them from seeking treatment 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer it 
is most often spread through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers or transfusion of infected blood or blood 
products 
as of may 30 aids had been diagnosed in 63726 americans of 
whom more than half or 35798 have died according to the 
national centers for disease control

a 23yearold sikh woman married an 
assassin of prime minister indira gandhi in a bizarre ceremony 
during which a photograph stood in for the bridegroom a newspaper 
said today 
the statesman newspaper said surinder kaur was married may 2 to 
a photograph of satwant singh in a village in punjab state 
singh could not attend the wedding because he is in jail on 
death row 
the marriage rites were performed by a sikh priest the 
newspaper said but it was unclear on whether the ceremony had 
legal or religious sanction 
mrs kaur garlanded a photograph of satwant singh and carried it 
around a fire seven times the newspaper said the bride and groom 
customarily walk around a fire in orthodox sikh weddings 
singh and mrs kaur had been engaged since 1983 
in 1984 singh was assigned to guard the prime minister on oct 
31 1984 he and another sikh bodyguard shot mrs gandhi in the 
garden of her residence in the capital 
singh now 25 was convicted of murder and sentenced to be 
hanged by a special court an appeal is pending before the supreme 
court 
the statesman said mrs kaur went through with the marriage 
despite opposition from her parents and singhs parents 
i tried everything i could do to stop her mrs kaurs 
father wirsa singh was quoted as telling the newspaper which 
said the parents yielded after their daughter threatened to commit 
suicide if not allowed to marry 
satwant singh was informed of his marriage two weeks after the 
ceremony when his parents visited him at new delhis central jail 
the paper said 
it did not report his reaction 
whatever happens i stand by my act of marrying him the 
statesman quoted the bride as saying if unhappiness is to be my 
lot then let it be so 
satwant singh is one of three people facing the death sentence 
for the assassination apparently carried out in revenge for the 
governments decision to storm the golden temple the holiest sikh 
shrine in june 1984 
at least 1200 people most of them sikhs were killed when 
soldiers stormed the temple in 1984 the shrine in amritsar 260 
miles northwest of new delhi was being used as a base by sikh 
militants agitating for an independent homeland 
sikhs form just 2 percent of indias 800 million people but are 
in a majority in punjab dissident sikhs claim discrimination by 
the hindus who form 80 percent of the population

lt gov leo mccarthy easily won the right to 
face republican incumbent sen pete wilson this fall while the 
states voters narrowly declined a chance to become the first to 
directly order the closing of a nuclear plant 
california voters on tuesday also rejected propositions that 
could have quarantined aids victims split the nations largest 
county in two and relaxed government spending limits imposed by 
californias 1979 tax revolt 
mccarthy soundly defeated three political unknowns in the 
democratic senate primary in tuesdays voting 
with 100 percent of the 23596 precincts reporting mccarthy 
amassed 2303029 votes or 82 percent john hancock abbott of santa 
clara had 214420 votes or 8 percent robert banuelos of orange had 
159610 votes or 6 percent and charles greene of los angeles had 
142520 votes or 5 percent 
in the presidential primaries massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis swept to an easy victory over jesse jackson netting the 
fraction of the states 314 democratic delegates he needed to 
clinch his partys nomination while vice president george bush won 
the states republican primary where 175 delegates were being 
awarded 
san diego mayor maureen oconnor coasted to an easy reelection 
victory over former city councilman floyd morrow with all the vote 
counted oconner pulled in 124222 votes or 595 percent to 
morrows 69974 or 335 percent 
among a slew of ballot measures tuesday was a 1 billion bond 
measure sponsored by gov george deukmejian to fund highway 
construction and improvement with all precincts reporting the 
proposal barely lost by 2560221 no votes to 2559394 in favor 
another that narrowly lost was proposition 71 designed to relax 
spending limits californians placed on their state government in a 
1979 voter initiative the measure would have permitted an 
estimated 700 million annual increase in state spending reducing 
by an equal amount the funds likely to be earmarked for future tax 
rebates 
with 100 percent of the precincts reporting the vote total was 
2579562 against or 51 percent to 2472003 in favor or 49 
percent 
proposition 72 which also would have changed the spending 
limit but with almost exactly the opposite effect was defeated 38 
percent to 61 percent 3167414 votes to 1980987 it would have 
reduced the limit for most state programs by an estimated 725 
million annually by earmarking those funds exclusively for highways 
a proposal backed by extremist lyndon larouche to declare aids a 
communicable disease was soundly defeated 3605580 to 1691300 
or 68 percent to 32 percent 
the proposition was opposed by the california medical 
association and the leadership of both major parties it matched a 
measure sponsored by larouches organization that was beaten 21 in 
1986 
in sacramento county an initiative that sought to close the 
troubled rancho seco nuclear power plant narrowly lost with all of 
880 precincts reporting the measure was defeated by 125768 votes 
or 504 percent to 123614 votes or 496 percent if passed it 
would have marked the first time in history that voters directly 
ordered closure of a nuclear plant 
however a competing measure to continue operating the plant on 
a trial basis for an additional 18 months passed by 129929 votes 
or 516 percent to 121803 votes or 484 percent 
a proposal to carve out a new mojave county from the desert 
portions of san bernardino county the nations largest lost by 
111283 votes or 67 percent to 54709 or 329 percent with 707 
of 804 precincts reporting 
proposition 68 which would impose contribution limits on 
legislative races and create a system of public financing for 
candidates who limit spending was approved by 53 percent 
2716341 to 47 percent 2425064 
a competing proposition to limit contributions in all races and 
prohibit public financing was approved by a 58 percent to 42 
percent margin with 3044034 votes in favor and 2206718 opposed 
however since proposition 73 was favored by a wider margin than 
proposition 68 proposition 73s provisions would supersede those 
of the other 
only one congressional incumbent freshman republican ernest 
konnyu of saratoga lost his seat stanford university professor 
tom campbell a moderate supported by konnyus two republican 
predecessors former reps pete mccloskey and ed zschau won by 58

in two heavily republican los angelesarea congressional 
districts in which the incumbents retired the winners in the gop 
primaries were two former reagan white house aides who campaigned

was the victor in the 13candidate 40th district primary while 
former speechwriter dana rohrabacher of los angeles topped a field 
of eight republicans seeking the 42nd district nomination 
in the senate primary both wilson and mccarthy concentrated on 
fundraising and laying the groundwork for november

israeli authorities today offered protection to 
arab officials in the occupied west bank after an israeliappointed 
arab mayor was stabbed in the heart apparently by palestinian 
militants 
the army maintained a curfew on el bireh and some areas in the 
neighboring town of ramallah as it continued to search for suspects 
in the tuesday stabbing of hassan tawil 74 the el bireh mayor 
tawil was in stable condition said a doctor at ramallah 
hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the israelis are trying to stop other arab officials from 
quitting under pressure from militants 
the israeli newspaper maariv said the military government would 
step up protection for the arab officials but it did not specify 
what steps would be taken an army spokesman refused comment 
a 19yearold man from the gaza strip refugee camp of jebalya 
died overnight from wounds he suffered when beaten by israel 
soldiers dr ahmed yassih of gaza citys shifa hospital said the 
army confirmed hussein jama abujallalah died but said said the 
circumstances and cause of death were not clear 
the death would raise the number of arabs killed in the 
sixmonth old palestinian uprising to 202 two israelis have also 
died in the unrest in lands israel seized in the 1967 middle east 
war 
israel radio today reported the army would prosecute an officer 
and two soldiers for excessive use of force in arura a village 
near ramallah where two residents said they were buried under a 
pile of rocks last month 
hanna atrash the elected arab mayor of the west bank town of 
beit sahour said eight soldiers in two jeeps offered to protect 
him but he refused when they said he couldnt go anywhere without 
them 
i also told them they are hurting me more than they are 
helping me he said 
atrash was elected mayor in 1976 the last year israel allowed 
free elections in the territories 
tawil is one of about a dozen arab mayors appointed by the 
military government to replace israeli officers who ran the towns 
and cities after some mayors were deposed and elections were 
banned the heads of about 85 village councils also are appointed 
by the military government 
a senior military official said army representatives were 
meeting with arab officials to block resignations anticipated after 
the stabbing and the appearance of a new underground leaflet 
calling on israeliappointed officials to resign 
many arab officials have received threats or had their homes 
stoned or firebombed in recent weeks said the official also 
speaking on condition on anonymity 
but by this morning not one person has resigned said 
olivier rafowicz spokesman for the army administration 
the mayor of the west bank town of qalqilya rahman abu sneineh 
condemned the stabbing and told israeli army radio that he did not 
want any protection because god will protect me 
abu sneineh who is considered a moderate said he had no reason 
to fear because i do not cooperate with the military government 
i only cooperate with the residents of my town 
the army said there was no basis for the allegation that 
esidents were buried under a pile of rocks in arura but the 
officer and two soldiers would be tried for using force on suspects 
after their arrest and allegedly shooting at the legs of protesters 
without justification israel radio said 
in a new leaflet issued tuesday the ploled united leadership 
of the uprising called for a general strike thursday 
for the first time underground leaders also called for arson 
attacks on farmland forests and industries inside israel the 
directive declared june 22 a day to burn the enemys agricultural 
and industrial resources

by a slender margin voters rejected an 
opportunity to become the first to approve the shutdown of a 
nuclear power plant and decided to give the problemplagued rancho 
seco plant another chance 
after an expensive and hardfought campaign area voters tuesday 
narrowly approved a ballot measure sponsored by rancho seco 
managers to grant an 18month trial run to the plant which has one 
of the worst performance records in the nation 
with all precincts reporting from sacramento county and a 
1000vote section of placer county the unofficial totals were 
129929 votes or 516 percent in favor of the measure to 121803 
votes or 484 percent opposed 
a second initiative that would have shut down rancho seco 
permanently lost by a slight margin receiving 123614 votes or 
496 percent in favor and 125768 or 504 percent against 
the battle of the competing propositions was a victory for the 
sacramento municipal utility district which operates rancho seco 
and put the second measure on the ballot and for the nuclear 
industry which heavily funded a 14 million campaign to save the 
plant 
rancho seco has operated at an average of only 40 percent of 
capacity and has suffered more than 100 outages since it opened in 
october 1984 
were happy that the community has given us an opportunity to 
prove ourselves said dave crespo of the rancho seco political 
action committee a group of plant employees and contractors who 
took part in the ballot campaign 
we have a major chore ahead of us to demonstrate in physical 
terms that the plant is safe and can operate reliably he said 
harold singer president of the us council for energy 
awareness an industry group noted that no state or local ballot 
measure to shut down a nuclear power plant had ever passed 
nationally 14 measures to close or block nuclear plants had been 
defeated in the last 13 years he said 
but opponents of rancho seco who spent 400000 in their 
campaign said the plant had won only a reprieve and not 
vindication 
the voters have placed rancho seco on probation and they may 
have only forestalled for a short time the inevitable closing of 
the reactor which is one of the worst in the country said ken 
bossong of public citizen a ralph nader group that supported the 
antirancho seco campaign 
he said the vote was the closest in us history on a measure to 
close a nuclear plant 
the issue is not going to go away said sacramento mayor 
anne rudin a supporter of the closure proposal people just 
dont trust it rancho seco to work efficiently 
rancho seco located 25 miles southeast of the state capital 
has one of the worst performance records in the country according 
to the nuclear regulatory commission 
the movement to close the plant gained momentum following a 
severe overcooling accident in december 1985 that idled the plant 
for 27 months it was restarted two months ago after a 400 million 
overhaul 
the approved measure provides for a second public vote on 
continued operation of rancho seco in 18 months and requires 
closure of the plant any time after dec 31 if it fails to operate 
at more than 50 percent capacity for four consecutive months

michael dukakis fresh from a 
nominationclinching fourstate primary sweep said today neither 
jesse jackson nor anyone else is due an offer to join him on 
the democratic ticket 
dukakis who locked up the democratic presidential nomination 
with a fourprimary sweep tuesday said he will review the possible 
candidates within the next few days 
asked if jackson his closest opponent in the primaries 
deserved to be choice dukakis said i dont think anyone is due 
an offer 
but there are a great many people that are going to be 
considered and hell be one of them and im not going to rule 
anybody in or out at this point he said in an interview taped 
earlier on abctv 
jackson interviewed on the same program said consideration 
does mean an offer it does not mean just in passing we have 
earned consideration 
today following the final primary contests dukakis held a 
majority of nominating delegates his victory in the fight for the 
nomination comes just under four months after his triumph in new 
hampshire set him on the winners path 
jackson the last of six rivals still contesting him in a race 
where the suspense was long since spent was beaten in each of the 
four states holding primaries tuesday new jersey new mexico 
montana and california 
the massachusetts governor was heading home today stopping 
along the way in st louis to receive the public endorsement of one 
of those fallen rivals rep richard gephardt of missouri and 
another former foe was doing the same in washington sen paul 
simon dill 
another former rival bruce babbitt said he too would bestow 
his blessing today ill call him in the morning and tell him 
the former arizona governor said tuesday night in san francisco as 
dukakis was scoring a lopsided victory in california 
dukakis staged a victory rally at the elegant ballroom of the 
biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles 
my friends california has put us over the top dukakis 
said now the coasttocoast marathon has reached the pacific 
and tomorrow the race to the finish line begins 
in a thematic victory speech dukakis savored his new position 
as the partys nomineetobe 
my friends what a golden opportunity this is for us he 
said of the nomination and what quicksand for our opponents if 
they waste this opportunity on mudslinging and namecalling 
dukakis made little mention of jackson and the uncertainty over 
jacksons intentions at the convention in atlanta in july where he 
has threatened to lead a floor fight over south africa policy 
jackson speaking hours later was conciliatory saying i 
salute him for a fine campaign 
earlier in the day dukakis had contended he saw no real 
divisions within the party he will lead but at the same time he 
acknowledged he may have disputes with jackson over the platform 
we may have a floor fight or two dukakis said there may 
be some issues that go to the floor i dont see any great 
divisions within our party were going to have ourselves a great 
convention 
as he had done across california in the final few days dukakis 
recalled the start of his campaign nearly a year and a half ago 
with an exploratory trip into iowa in february 1987 a full year 
before that state led off the 1988 delegate season 
fifteen months ago in the snows of iowa and new hampshire we 
began our marathon run he said along the way our democratic 
rivals brought passion and substance to the competition and i want 
to pay special tribute to all of them 
dukakis won his way to the nomination with a steady methodical 
some said plodding manner that proved successful despite 
critics who said he needed more passion 
dukakis finished third in iowas first caucuses and rebounded to 
win the primary in nextdoor new hampshire 
on super tuesday the big regional primary in early march 
dukakis did well enough he surrounded the south by winning in new 
england maryland florida and texas the last two the biggest 
prizes of that day and where he won without majorities 
he stumbled with a third place finish in illinois the next week 
and was stunned by a twotoone loss days later in michigans 
caucuses 
the twin setbacks raised questions about his abilities as a 
campaigner but dukakis remained calm and changed his speeches but 
not his style or tone 
he rebounded in wisconsin and by the time new yorks returns 
were counted in midapril there was little doubt who would be the 
democratic nominee

those convicted of firsttime drug possession in 
judge ted poes court will get probation with a twist their cars 
must bear a bumper sticker reading texas dont mess with 
drugs 
its not going to move mountains but its just another way of 
communicating that drugs are harmful the state judge said monday 
before instituting the policy poes probation requirements 
usually included regular urinalysis and drug treatment 
the decals are a toneddown version of those many people 
convicted of drunken driving must have on their cars warning 
motorists that the driver is a felon and advising them to report 
erratic driving to police 
so far the judge has given the stickers to six offenders he 
offers probation to firsttime nonviolent offenders only and not 
to drug dealers 
the only place a dealer is going to be able to put a bumper 
sticker is on his tractor up at the penitentiary poe said 
poe is known for his creative probation requirements some 
people placed on probation in his court worked on the restoration 
of the battleship texas and a drunken driver had to erect a cross 
where he killed the victim 
the old paths are not the proven paths poe said of his 
unorthodox ways

may have been involved in plotting attacks on the olympic games in 
seoul arrived today to heavy police guard after being deported from 
the philippines

hiroshi sensui as it arrived at tokyos narita airport the tokyo 
broadcasting service said 
the npa official said police would start interrogating sensui 
51 at metropolitan police headquarters tonight the official spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
sensui was arrested tuesday at a suburban manila hotel and 
hustled aboard a japan air lines jet bound for tokyo today 
officials said sensui was a member of the leftist japanese red 
army and had been sought since 1977 when he was released from 
prison in exchange for hostages aboard a jal plane the terrorist 
group had hijacked in bangladesh 
in manila mirian defensorsantiago the philippine immigration 
commissioner told reporters sensui had undergone plastic surgery 
at the hospital where he was arrested and had to be identified by 
fingerprints 
she said the man had been living in the philippines for several 
years under the name hiroshi yamaguchi and had denied he was sensui 
mrs defensorsantiago said there were preliminary reports 
from regional security officials that the terrorists have 
initiated activity expected to culminate in the olympic games

use manila as a base for operations during the summer olympic 
games which begin sept 17 in seoul

plotting to disrupt the games using japanese and other 
international terrorists

make similar arrests 
police had been searching for sensui since he disappeared last 
november from a manila hotel where he had been under surveillance

lawyers from the international bar association who 
met with soviet lawyers and officials said today they found little 
evidence of new soviet thinking on jewish emigration 
what i have come away with are empty words and empty 
promises joseph smukler a lawyer from philadelphia said at a 
news conference held with jewish refuseniks at a moscow apartment 
soviet lawyers appear to be sincere about reforming the legal 
system yet the emigration problem is not being solved said irwin 
cotler a lawyer from montreal 
there is a legal revolution going on in this country but the 
problem is that the revolution does not embrace the right of 
emigration said cotler one of 250 lawyers including soviet 
delegates at the twoday meeting 
new soviet emigration laws require an invitation from a close 
relative something that international law lists as a possible 
additional reason to allow emigration he said 
cotler proposed sustained emigration of at least 25000 jews a 
year a policy of allowing complete reunification of families and 
protection of religious and cultural rights 
emigration of soviet jews reached a peak of more than 51000 in 
1979 it dropped to about 1000 a year in 198486 before rising to 
more than 8000 last year about 4500 jews were allowed to 
emigrate between january and may 1988 
two of the main reasons for refusal are alleged access to state 
secrets and refusal of relatives to renounce financial claims 
against those who wish to emigrate 
lawyers said one soviet speaker a lawyer from the institute of 
state and law they could identify only as katishkin said his 
institute was studying reforms that could ease those restrictions 
they said the lawyer proposed that restrictions on emigration 
for reasons of access to state secrets be limited to five years 
and that financial claims against wouldbe emigres be restricted 
the soviet news agency tass reported tuesday that rudolf 
kuznetsov head of the soviet visa office told the conference that 
soviet emigration laws are based on international law 
he said 40000 people emigrated from the soviet union in 1987 
and 29000 people left during the first five months of 1988 those 
who left this year are mostly jews armenians and ethnic germans 
he said 
the lawyers said about 20 israeli lawyers attended the 
conference but that another 10 were refused visas 
a british lawyer jonathan arkush said eight other lawyers at 
first were denied visas and the international bar association 
canceled the conference until soviet officials reversed their 
decision 
he said british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe intervened 
to gain visas for him and several other british lawyers

audi of america inc has offered to pay cash to 
some current or former audi 5000 owners who buy a new audi to 
settle a classaction suit charging that some of the cars were 
subject to sudden and unintentional acceleration 
the proposed settlement reached last week was made public 
tuesday it proposes offering 300000 owners of audi 5000 sedans 
with automatic transmissions payments of 300 to 2000 if they buy 
a new audi between sept 1 1988 and june 30 1991 
the deal would apply to audi 5000 sedans built between 1978 and 
1986 
audi spokesman tom mcdonald said the settlement would not be 
approved until after a public hearing july 26 before cook county 
circuit judge harold siegan 
mcdonald said audi made no admission of fault in the proposed 
settlement 
the proposed agreement he said states that car owners and 
investigators have been unable to identify any defect common to the 
vehicles that would cause unintended acceleration 
audi has been plagued with charges that its audi 5000 sedans 
with automatic transmissions sometimes accelerate on their own 
despite several investigations the cause of the problem has never 
been pinpointed 
the center for auto safety a consumer group based in 
washington contends that at least 1646 accidents resulting in 402 
injuries and five deaths were linked to sudden acceleration when 
the car was shifted from park into gear 
the payments would be made on a sliding scale depending on the 
model year of the car they owned and the date they buy a new audi

colombian cocaine lords have cut back on 
production to drive up prices and one result may be a summer of 
drug wars in the city a prosecutor says 
there wont be a lot of discussions just boom boom boom 
said sterling johnson the citys special narcotics prosecutor 
gangs will be trying to stake out their turfs in a climate where 
the supply of cocaine is decreased 
johnson said the price of bulk cocaine had risen from 14500 
per kilogram to 20000 in the past two weeks a kilogram or 22 
pounds converts to about 9000 vials of crack that sell for up to 
10 each on the street 
in one economically arrogant stroke they have created havoc 
and there are going to be a lot of innocent bystanders killed as a 
result johnson said tuesday at a forum held by a citizens 
anticrime group 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau also said his 
office was getting information that cocaine suppliers were holding 
back on the narcotic 
andrew maloney us attorney in brooklyn said that although 
his office had not detected a crimp in the cocaine pipeline he did 
not dispute johnsons information

a student demonstration for more democracy press 
freedom and better treatment of intellectuals failed to materialize 
today after armed police cordoned off beijings central tiananmen 
square 
dozens of students gathered at the square at midafternoon 
apparently traveling from beijing university and other schools but 
were thwarted by the heavy police presence and did not demonstrate 
as planned 
police quickly intervened after a dozen students from beijing 
university gathered later at the nearby national museum of chinese 
revolution and complained their right of expression had been 
violated 
one person was seen being taken away by police but the students 
said he was not one of them at dusk police were continuing to 
cordon off the square 
beijing authorities and the official media had warned students 
that their planned 10mile march from beijing university to 
tiananmen was against the law and would undermine the stability 
needed to carry out economic and political reform 
police stood at attention about 50 feet apart along the 
perimeter of the 100acre tiananmen square which lies in front of 
the forbidden city the former residence of chinas emperors 
police reinforcements and vehicles were also deployed along side 
streets around the square 
police when asked about the closing said we have a special 
activity or im not sure a few students sat in small groups 
on the sidewalk refusing to talk to reporters 
students at beijing university chinas most prestigious center 
of learning announced plans at a late night campus rally tuesday 
for a protest march this afternoon from the campus to tiananmen 
it would have been the first major political protest by students 
since nationwide student unrest in the winter of 198687 
that outbreak of opposition to government policies prompted a 
crackdown on western liberal ideas hu yaobang a noted liberal 
was ousted as communist party chief for failing to take quick 
action to quell the disturbances 
the current unrest was prompted by the june 2 slaying of a 
beijing university student in an offcampus brawl 
about 1000 students staged an allnight march from the campus 
to tiananmen square after the chai qingfeng 22 was killed police 
did not interfere with that demonstration which focused on demands 
for a quick resolution to the murder case and did not take up 
sensitive political issues 
six nonstudents were arrested for the crime as police moved 
quickly to satisfy student demands that the assailants be brought 
to justice but the protest has expanded to cover more general 
complaints 
the campus murder brought to the surface student unhappiness 
over poor living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects 
after graduation for the nations lowpaid intellectuals 
since the killing hundreds have gathered on the campus in the 
evenings for impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be 
learned from the incident 
dozens of posters have been pasted up on bulletin boards 
demanding democracy a free press an end to government corruption 
and greater respect and higher salaries for intellectuals

a federal court ordered the city to release 
hundreds of inmates from its overcrowded prisons by this evening a 
move that a prosecutor says will embolden criminals with the 
knowledge they face little chance of going to jail 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals on tuesday ordered the 
city to comply with a ruling restricting the prison population to 
3750 inmates 300 less than the number held as of saturday 
the city began releasing on bail monday inmates being held on 
bail of 2500 or less by early today 170 inmates had been 
released said city solicitor sy kurland 
we should be down to the constitutional limit he said we 
feel pretty confident that we can be down to the 3750 within 24 
hours 
the order forces authorities to release the additional inmates 
on bail the city must provide as long as a threat to exceed the 
cap exists authorities will be allowed to imprison only the most 
serious criminals 
you are going to have whole classes of people who cant be put 
in prison said sarah vandenbraak who represented the district 
attorneys office in opposing the cap 
ninetynine percent of the drug dealers we prosecute wont get 
in prison not even the major drug dealers if you deal a ton of 
marijuana today you will be on the streets tomorrow its not 
enough to put you in prison 
the order also will discourage prosecution in drug cases she 
said 
legally cases can go forth but if you see it is a wasted 
effort its hard to gear up to do it ms vandenbraak said 
whats the point of arresting drug dealers if they just can come 
back every day 
but prisoners attorney david richman said the population limit 
was proper 
i would feel a lot safer knowing that our prisons were being 
operated in a humane civilized fashion so that they didnt breed 
crime richman said after a lower court ruling friday 
people who allow jails which subject the residents to 
indignities that dont afford any opportunity for rehabilitation 
are just going to get people returned to them who are embittered 
and more prone to commit crime and thats a situation weve been 
living in for far too long 
the population ceiling was set in a consent decree the city 
signed in 1986 and originally was scheduled to meet a year ago the 
agreement stemmed from a 1982 classaction lawsuit by inmates 
challenging conditions in philadelphias four prisons 
on friday us district judge norma shapiro ordered the cap to 
take effect at midnight monday 
the appeals court issued an emergency stay at the request of 
district attorney ronald castille who said he needed time to 
prepare a formal appeal but it unexpectedly reversed itself 
tuesday in a onesentence order that gave no explanation 
after the reversal ms shapiro modified her order giving the 
city until 5 pm today to meet the cap and to restrict admissions 
inmates released to meet the limit would be those awaiting trial 
rather than those convicted because she has said she lacked power 
to reduce sentences imposed in state courts 
ms vandenbraak said the city will not take further legal action 
until another hearing scheduled before ms shapiro on june 22 
the city will be barred from admitting new inmates except those 
charged with the most serious crimes including murder attempted 
murder rape attempted rape kidnapping arson robbery and 
aggravated assault in addition to crimes involving use of a gun or 
knife or large amounts of drugs 
other suspects will be arraigned given court dates and freed 
the order requires the city to provide up to 250 bail for each 
suspect 
that said ms vandenbraak means the city ends up footing the 
bill to put dangerous criminals back on the street 
well be monitoring these people castille said well be 
waiting for them to be coming back with a murder or rape or 
robbery or shooting and then well lay the blame where it 
belongs with the mayor and the city solicitor 
castille who believes that city prisons can humanely hold at 
least 4300 inmates said mayor wilson goode and city solicitor sy 
kurland should never have agreed to the prison population cap 
kurland blamed the reagan administration for not providing 
enough money to build prisons 
the city is building a fifth prison scheduled for completion in 
1991 
thats only 440 beds thats no going to solve the problem 
ms vandenbraak said

more than 1 million black 
workers and students stayed home today as a nationwide general 
strike moved into its third and final day police reported 
widespread violence 
ten people were killed during the strike south africas longest 
and biggest general strike 
police said they dispersed unruly crowds with shotguns and tear 
gas 
black labor unions and antiapartheid groups staged the boycott 
to protest a 2yearold state of emergency more recent 
restrictions on their activities and proposed legislation to 
restrict the rights of unions to strike 
the death toll from violence reported by police since the strike 
began monday rose to 10 with the shotgun death of a toddler and the 
machetekilling of a young man 
overnight a train engine and freight car were derailed near 
johannesburg buses private trucks police vehicles and homes 
were firebombed and stoned in several townships in natal and 
transvaal province police said 
they said 15 people were injured and 25 arrested 
the government has said the protest is illegal and employers 
said tuesday that workers were returning to their jobs in many 
areas 
the congress of south african trade unions the nations largest 
black union group said at least 25 million people had honored the 
boycott 
independent analysts said those figures were probably high but 
based on the low numbers of passengers riding buses and trains from 
the black townships to cities such as johannesburg durban and port 
elizabeth the absentee rate among black workers nationwide easily 
could exceed 15 million they said 
including the neartotal boycott by urban black students the 
figure for each day would have surpassed 2 million the estimated 
number of people who stayed home on june 16 1986 during a protest 
against the beginning of the national state of emergency 
that strike was the longest staged over many different economic 
sectors 
the congress said it would consider meeting with the 
governments manpower chief to discuss the labor bill that sparked 
the strike 
police said a 22yearold man was hacked to death with a machete 
in hammarsdale in natal and a 2yearold child was found dead 
with a shotgun wound to the chest in ashdown also in natal 
they said a group of blacks killed the man after setting homes 
on fire but they gave no details on the death of the child 
police reported using shotgun fire tear gas and rubber bullets 
to disperse crowds in several cases of violence in natal where 
groups who oppose the strike have clashed with militant protest 
supporters 
the black trade union group called on employers to participate 
in an independent inquiry into the effects of the labor bill which 
all black unions have opposed it said it would also consider 
meeting with manpower minister pieter du plessis to discuss the 
legislation which is about to be passed in the whitedominated 
parliament 
congress leader jay naidoo said the strike reflected the 
widescale resentment and anger about orders issued in february 
that barred his organization and other antiapartheid groups from 
political activity 
president pw bothas government imposed the emergency june 12 
1986 to combat a black uprising against apartheid under which 
south africas 5 million whites control the country and deny its 26 
million blacks a voice in national affairs 
du plessis has warned workers that they might be dismissed from 
their jobs for participating in the strike 
police have warned news media about reporting on the extent of 
the strike and the governmentrun broadcasting services have 
continually given upbeat reports about percentages of workers 
returning to their jobs since monday 
figures from government and private transport companies and 
employers indicated that the black workforce attendance in most of 
the johannesburgpretoria area was half of normal in durban the 
nations third largest city about 90 percent of the workers were 
staying home 
the private putco bus company said ridership from black 
townships east of johannesburg was 98 percent below normal 
ridership from soweto however was 40 percent below average 
representing a steady increase each day from the countrys largest 
black township 
despite reports of the strikes success the mining industry 
which produces 80 percent of south africas export earnings has 
been only slightly affected by the protest

jesse jackson said today his showing in the 
democratic primaries had earned him an offer of the vice 
presidential spot and not just in passing 
jackson refused to say his presidential hopes were completely 
gone contending that its not over till its over in atlanta 
at the democratic national convention but in television interviews 
he repeatedly spoke of having earned a vice presidential offer 
suggesting recognition that dukakis had sewn up the presidential 
nomination 
ive earned an option to accept it or turn it down jackson 
said of the no 2 spot in an interview on cbstv taped earlier 
he added on abctv consideration does mean an offer it does 
not mean just in passing we have earned consideration he did 
not say whether he would accept such an offer 
dukakis said on abc i dont think anyone is due an offer 
he added there are a great many people that are going to be 
considered and hell be one of them and im not going to rule 
anybody in or out at this point 
jackson said he had clearly stated his intentions regarding his 
hopes for himself and demands for positions he wants the democratic 
party to take 
but he added no one running in a process like this plays with 
transparent cards you have to have the wisdom to use your leverage 
to maximize change 
in his concession speech tuesday night jackson congratulated 
dukakis for a well managed and dignified campaign and said 
their contest had been fought without rancor 
but jackson told supporters at an election night celebration 
that the super delegates and atlarge delegates are fluid 
until they vote in atlanta thats why we will continue until the 
roll call in atlanta 
he plans to continue traveling and making public appearances 
and said he will be contacting every super delegate and atlarge 
delegate for support 
jackson praised dukakis who on tuesday gained enough delegates 
to cinch the nomination for staying above the fray above the 
attacks above the meanness 
the governor has run a wellmanaged and dignified campaign 
i believe that we have shown that it is possible to compete without 
conflict differ without division 
jackson supporters said his losses by margins of more than 
twotoone in the california montana new jersey and new mexico 
were expected 
in california where jacksons campaign had placed heavy 
resources and commitment he had his best showing hovering close 
to 35 percent with 69 percent of the vote counted 
anything over 30 percent is a very significant performance 
said bert lance a jackson adviser and former confidant to 
president jimmy carter 
california campaign director mike murase said his results showed 
jackson did as expected in california and that he won several 
cities in new jersey but was beaten badly in that states rural 
areas 
cbs news tracking polls showed jackson got 25 percent of the 
white vote in california one of his better showings among whites 
across the nation but only 9 percent of the white vote in new 
jersey 
in his speech at the los angeles hilton jackson chose to 
emphasize the legacy of his campaign rather than dwell on his 
continued march to the summer democratic convention 
he said he had successfully injected themes into the political 
debate this year most notably bringing the drug crisis to the top 
of the political agenda 
he said he has built a mighty coalition that will continue 
to be heard 
together we have ushered in a new political era a new era 
of citizen action of concern and care of hope and change is 
beginning 
we have created a new permanent force in american politics 
were here to stay tonight is not a celebration this is a 
declaration he said 
earlier in the day jackson was peppered with questions about 
whether he agreed with some of his top advisers that dukakis should 
offer to make him his running mate 
he repeated earlier statements that he deserves consideration 
but jackson also said its up to the convention to determine the 
nominee and his running mate hinting that would be one reason to 
continue building delegate strength 
the commitments made by atlarge and super delegates are 
nonbinding until convention time and so its appropriate to make 
appeals to delegates based upon friendship based upon constituent 
considerations he told reporters 
jackson in recent days has increasingly stressed that the 
presidential nomination process does not end with the last 
primaries but goes on to the politicking at the national 
convention 
lance said he does not think it will be divisive for jackson to 
remain an active candidate theres nothing wrong with courting 
the super delegates he said i think jesse jackson has been 
good for the party 
hes still got a message said another supporter former new 
mexico gov toney anaya 
after months of a grueling breakneck campaign pace jackson 
planned to head to san diego today for a twoday vacation with his 
family before returning home to chicago

police seized 45 pounds of 
heroin hidden in hollowedout rocks coated to resemble jade and 
arrested at least three people in the thirdbiggest drug haul in 
canadian history authorities said 
the street value of the haul was variously estimated by police 
at 120 million and 154 million 
terry langley director of intelligence for canada customs said 
tuesday that 205 kilograms more than 45 pounds of 87 percent 
pure heroin was seized in vancouver three people were arrested in 
windsor ontario on monday 
it represents a tremendous amount of heroin in any mans 
language anywhere in the world said royal canadian mounted 
police staff sgt smokey stovern 
by comparison the french connection ring smuggled about 70 
pounds of heroin into the united states from 1968 to 1971 
langley said customs agents in vancouver became suspicious about 
paperwork for a shipment listed as jade from bangkok thailand to 
montreal the shipment packed in wooden crates was intercepted by 
canadian customs in vancouver may 9 after being trucked across the 
border from seattle police said 
the rocks turned out to be granite not jade and xrays showed 
a cavity in one when they broke one of the rocks they 
discovered the heroin langley said 
langley said the smugglers had drilled out the rocks stuffed 
them with heroin sealed the holes and then coated the rocks with a 
greentinged dirt and sand mixture to make them look like jade 
it was a very good job he said 
mounties removed most of the heroin and replaced it with a 
lookalike powder the mounties followed the shipment to montreal 
and waited for someone to claim the rocks the path eventually led 
to the windsor area 
john laudicina 42 of sandwich south township near windsor 
joseph guaragna 23 and antonio zambito 46 both of montreal 
were arrested monday in a raid on a home about 12 miles east of 
windsor authorities said 
they were charged with possession of narcotics and face a 
maximum sentence of life in prison 
weve never really come into contact with this type of 
concealment before langley said the majority of our 
experience in the past has dealt with falsesided suitcases and 
body packs for heroin 
the largest heroin haul in canadian history was 60 kilos or 132 
pounds in 1972 and 70 pounds were confiscated in 1986 both in 
montreal officials said 
a drug crackdown in the united states is diverting shipments to 
canada and vancouver is a prime port of entry because of its 
proximity to southeast asia the origin of much of the heroin and 
other drugs langley said

high school graduation ceremonies in an 
affluent erie suburb have been canceled over fears that some 
students might try to commit suicide on stage officials said 
about 150 seniors were to have received their diplomas on sunday 
in the fairview school district 
the problem is if one person on this stage shoots himself or 
someone else the board is responsible and the board has 
evidence there is a possibility this could happen district 
solicitor frank kroto said tuesday at a meeting of board members 
and parents 
a senior at the school committed suicide over the christmas 
vacation in front of another student in addition several 
administrators have received threats and are under police 
protection kroto said 
its more than just pranks kroto said of the threats today 
certain students and certain groups of students continue to 
make threats and theres enough substance to what they say and 
what else is happening in the community to make the school board 
aware of it 
psychologists and psychiatrists were brought in to counsel 
students and teachers after the suicide said board president 
barbara junker kroto said there were unofficial reports 
circulating that more students had attempted suicide 
over the course of the past several months we have been in 
constant contact with various individuals and groups within the 
student body who have threatened to cause serious disruption at 
this years graduation ms junker said

a bipartisan group of senators today announced 
a watereddown version of a bill requiring private firms to offer 
unpaid leave to new parents but the bipartisan compromise failed 
to draw business support 
sen christopher dodd dconn chief sponsor of the new 
measure said he and his colleagues made some very tough 
decisions and major changes designed to reduce the cost of the bill 
and help employers plan for workers taking unpaid leave 
the bill introduced today by 16 democrats and six republicans 
would require businesses with 20 or more workers to offer 
jobprotected parental and medical leave to employees who had been 
with a firm at least a year the original bill covered businesses 
with 15 or more workers without regard for the length of service 
employees would be entitled to up to 10 weeks on the birth 
adoption or serious illness of a child or 13 weeks of medical 
leave for a personal illness that compares to 18 weeks and 26 
weeks respectively in the initial bill 
the general accounting office said the new version of the plan 
would cost employers less than 194 million most of that in health 
insurance premiums for employees on leave the gao estimated the 
initial dodd bill would have cost less than 500 million 
the concerned alliance of responsible employers a coalition of 
corporations and business groups said it remains opposed to this 
wellintentioned but misguided legislation 
the alliance one of many business groups fighting parental 
leave bills in the house and senate said changes in the amount of 
leave and the number of eligible workers havent changed its 
opposition to governmentmandated employee benefits of any type 
the house education and labor committee last november passed a 
family and medical leave act requiring firms of over 50 employees 
to offer at least 10 weeks unpaid leave to parents and up to 15 
weeks for a personal illness the bill unlike its senate 
counterpart also requires that leave be available to employees who 
must care for a sick relative other than a child

sen paul simon saying the verdict is in 
today formally pulled the curtain on his quest for the democratic 
presidential nomination and endorsed michael dukakis 
the illinois senator said he would urge his 150 or so democratic 
delegates to join him in backing the massachusetts governor unless 
they have strong leanings toward another candidate from illinois 
jesse jackson 
simon suspended his faltering campaign two months ago saying he 
anticipated a brokered convention in atlanta that never 
materialized 
conventional wisdom has conventionally been wrong on just 
about everything he said at a news conference at democratic 
national committee headquarters 
the primaries and caucuses are now history the verdict is in 
i will vote for michael dukakis at the convention and will do 
everything i can to advance his candidacy after the convention 
he said 
the illinois senator had amassed about 180 delegates primarily 
on the strength of his homestate win in the march 15 illinois 
primary but about 30 had defected in recent weeks most to dukakis 
his failure to drop out of the race earlier angered some jackson 
supporters in a bow to them simon said i will urge delegates 
who have no strong commitment in any other direction to vote for 
michael dukakis 
he said dukakis must make clear that he has a positive program 
of jobs for quality education for longterm care for moving away 
from the arms race for things our party traditionally has stood 
for 
the bowtied liberal simon whose hopes were buoyed by his 
secondplace finish behind richard gephardt in iowas opening 
caucuses last february said dukakis clearly is more sensitive to 
the fundamental needs of our nation than republican george bush 
i am releasing my delegates though i expect to work with them 
on the platform and other matters that may come before the 
convention he said 
he praised jackson who he said has contributed immensely to 
our party by making us more sensitive to the needs of the less 
fortunate 
but he said democratic voters had clearly chosen dukakis who 
through the course of this campaign has demonstrated his leadership 
skills his substance and his commitment to progress for all 
americans 
dukakis who sewed up the nomination by sweeping tuesdays final 
primaries in california new jersey montana and new mexico was 
also headed to missouri today to pick up the endorsement of another 
erstwhile rival rep richard gephardt 
in february he came out of the gate finishing a close second in 
the iowa caucuses behind gephardt and third in new hampshires 
primary behind dukakis and gephardt 
but with the exception of his homestate win it was mostly 
downhill from there as simon went down in the polls and deeper into 
debt he sat out the march 8 super tuesday primaries across the 
south then fared poorly in contests in michigan wisconsin and 
elsewhere 
he said in april that he wanted to hang onto his delegates to 
have some influence over whom the party nominated 
but in recent weeks more than 30 of simons 180 delegates 
defected most to dukakis 
simon 59 a freshman senator whose term expires in 1990 ran as 
an unabashed liberal democrat im not a neoanything he 
boasted 
he promised to curb the arms race and to provide longterm 
health care for the elderly public works jobs for the unemployed 
and major new education initiatives 
he encountered skepticism about how he would comply with another 
promise balancing the budget in three years 
suspending his campaign two months ago instead of ending it 
allowed simon to retain 47 atlarge illinois delegates who 
otherwise would have gone to jesse jackson the runnerup in the 
illinois primary that rankled jackson supporters 
simon has expressed little interest in the no 2 spot on the 
democratic ticket saying last friday im frankly not interested 
in spending four years cutting ribbons and attending state 
funerals 
and he made clear on april 7 that his first fling at the 
presidency was also his last 
running for president is a little like taking an icecold 
shower he said then its a great onetime experience but i 
have no yearning for a repeat performance

a faulty fan started an apartment house 
blaze that killed five children a man and a pregnant woman the 
fire chief said today 
a woman and two other men were injured in the earlymorning fire 
tuesday one floor above a used furniture store in a dilapidated 
section of this southwestern ohio city 
the buildings sole streetlevel access door was padlocked in 
violation of the city fire code said fire chief don lickert 
residents apparently locked and unlocked the padlock by reaching 
through a window in the door he said 
lickert said a fan on the floor of the living room is believed 
to have started the fire temperatures soared into the 90s the day 
before the fire and overnight lows fell to the 60s 
we dont know if the motor froze or if the cord shorted out 
he said it will be checked by an electrical engineer 
lickert said the the buildings owners will receive a 100 
citation for not having a working smoke detector in the apartment 
six of the seven victims were found beneath a boarded window 
that also may have prevented their escape the chief said however 
there were at least two unblocked windows in the apartment fire 
officials said 
the seventh victim a 30yearold man was found in a 
secondfloor hallway 
the victims died of smoke inhalation according to butler county 
coroner dr richard burkhardt 
elizabeth blackburn who owns the building with her husband 
art said she was unaware of the padlocked door on the threestory 
woodenframe building 
under the city code there should have been at least one smoke 
detector for each of the three apartments on the second floor and 
another in the hallway but lickert said firefighters found only 
one smoke detector with no batteries 
city inspectors had noted the lack of smoke detectors in a 
previous inspection and mrs blackburn had them installed 
officials said 
firefighters could not account for the missing detectors 
lickert said 
routine inspections would have stopped the likelihood of 
something like this happening said dr william karwische city 
health commissioner 
killed were faye dunham reeseman 18 and her 2yearold son 
christopher who occupied one apartment mary smith 6 jennifer 
miller 4 and twins wesley and james miller 2 ms reeseman was 
three months pregnant the coroner said 
mrs blackburn said the smith girl and the millers were the 
children of karen miller 30 who was hospitalized in serious 
condition ms miller and her children lived in a second apartment 
officials said 
there was no indication whether lee cooper whose body was found 
in the hallway was related to the other victims 
a 24yearold man and a 20yearold man were hospitalized in 
fair condition

the white house expressed confidence today 
about winning a senate attempt to override president reagans veto 
of comprehensive trade legislation and predicted a substitute 
measure can be enacted that would be acceptable 
we believe the veto will be sustained said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater he said the administration will begin 
working quickly with congress on another version 
our discussions with the congress indicate that a number of 
members would like to have a trade bill democrat and republican 
that they feel its important for the country as well as 
politically and the committee leadership certainly is interested 
in a bill said fitzwater 
i think there is a growing body that feels like a trade bill 
is needed and can be passed he added 
some such as sen john heinz rpa a strong supporter of the 
bill say they still think a version acceptable to reagan can be 
fashioned this session 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said tuesday 
that the bills pulse is still beating but there was nothing 
he could do to budge perhaps 36 senators prepared to sustain 
reagans veto 
byrd told reporters there was still hope that homestate 
pressures would change a few minds at the last minute 
the house already has voted to override reagans veto senate 
failure to follow suit could doom trade legislation for the rest of 
1988 and send some administration loyalists into fall campaigns 
with an achilles heel on the issue 
this veto is going to be used as a political issue this year 
we all know that heinz warned his colleagues 
some administration supporters clearly would like another crack 
at the issue before november the administration has been urging a 
scaleddown bill that would win the presidents support but byrd 
has been warning that a fres bill would be peppered with amendments 
and could become hopelessly bogged down 
the bills chief provisions would overhaul the system under 
which the government imposes import curbs to aid us industries 
and retaliate against international trade violations 
other features range from a potential 2 billion in agricultural 
subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oilindustry 
earnings 
reagans may 24 veto focused on a provision that would require 
companies with 100 employees or more to provide their workers with 
60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs he said 
the provision would take away too much management flexibility 
reagan also was critical of restrictions in the bill on alaskan oil 
exports 
a twothirds majority is needed in congress to override a 
presidential veto the bills backers failed to gain that when the 
senate passed the bill 6336 on april 27 and the lawmakers 
appeared to remain frozen in the positions they took then 
the only democrat to oppose the measure was retiring sen 
william proxmire dwis who has fought provisions that would 
relax the foreign corrupt practices act 
obtaining criminal convictions of businessmen for overseas 
payoffs would become more difficult because of the changes 
thats why i call it the bringbackbribery bill proxmire said 
tuesday 
as debate began heinz said the political potential of the issue 
should not prompt lawmakers to give up on trying to fashion a bill 
that reagan would sign 
anybody can just sit in the stands and boo the umpire he 
said if theres a chance to pull this game out albeit in extra 
innings we should at least take our last at bats 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said getting another 
trade bill through this year might take an agreement that would bar 
amendments he said there was precedent for doing that but 
indicated it still might be difficult 
if the presidents veto is sustained said sen alan 
cranston dcalif it may be a long long time before we get 
another chance to pass a comprehensive trade bill dont let anyone 
tell you that it will be as simple as passing the same trade bill 
without the plantclosing provision to which the president 
objects 
sen edward m kennedy dmass told lawmakers that reagans 
veto could be described only as a triumph of ideology over 
fairness and good sense 
will we give americas workers 60 days notice of plant 
closings and mass layoffs kennedy said or will we allow them 
to be treated like chattel thrown onto the street when business 
has no further use for them 
sen charles grassley riowa however said the plantclosings 
provision could hurt advertising agencies and other companies 
dependent on contracts that can be canceled suddenly he said that 
in such cases the businesses might have to keep hundreds of highly 
paid employees on the payroll without any work to do 
im a believer in the adage grassley said if it aint 
broke dont fix it

sixty of indianas 92 counties were declared federal disaster 
areas today because of a drought threatening midwest crops 
elsewhere an atlantaarea fire chief worried about hydrants 
going dry and the art institute of chicago was warned to halt 
daytime watering of lawns as officials in droughtgripped regions 
imposed new restrictions on water use 
earlier this week 24 other indiana counties were declared 
disaster areas by the federal government thereby permitting 
emergency grazing and haying on land set aside under government 
programs 
if it doesnt rain soon farmers in southern indiana may face 
the worst spring drought in 25 years said jack washburn harrison 
county extension agent the midwest has had no significant rainfall 
since the end of april 
water usage in indianapolis on tuesday was a record 18215 
million gallons breaking the old mark of 175 million gallons set 
the week before water company officials said 
with pastures deteriorating in illinois us agriculture 
secretary richard lyng agreed tuesday to a request from state 
congressional leaders for an emergency decree allowing farmers to 
graze livestock and collect hay in 35 counties normally offlimits 
under federal programs 
minnesota gov rudy perpich sent a letter tuesday asking lyng to 
release for haying and grazing all or part of the nearly 2 million 
acres the states farmers have enrolled in a conservation program 
the action would help farmers avoid excessive feed costs caused by 
drought perpich said 
crop yields are down substantially throughout minnesota farmers 
said 
even if it does rain its not going to do much good unless 
some lucky farmer gets a thundershower above his farm said art 
ramsdell of the national weather service in paducah ky just 
across the illinois line weve got no relief in sight 
in kentucky state water officials said the drought is rated 
severe in the horsebreeding country around lexington and moderate 
or mild elsewhere 
berea 30 miles south of lexington is the most parched area in 
the state with rainfall 96 inches below normal according to pamla 
a wood supervisor of the waterquantity management section of the 
state division of water 
in northern georgia only a few showers and thundershowers were 
expected today 
in several subdivisions north of atlanta hydrants ran dry 
monday night fulton county fire chief james gibson said tuesday 
there would have been serious problems had a major fire broken out 
restrictions on watering lawns were imposed in northern fulton 
county roswell north of atlanta and carrollton near the alabama 
border 
in illinois restrictions went into effect in chicago suburbs 
north and south of the city mahomet in the central section of the 
state and troy in the south 
the art institute was warned it was violating restrictions by 
watering lawns during the day said chicago water department 
spokeswoman cindy gountanis watering is allowed only at night and 
during a few hours after dawn 
our people also put about 1000 locking caps on fire hydrants 
in areas where people are prone to turning them on to get cool 
ms gountanis said that can cause serious local pressure drops 
chicago does not have a water shortage however communities 
farther from lake michigan were reporting problems with water 
pressure she said 
normally we have around 10 to 11 feet of water in our 
reservoir but we were down to 6 feet said tim scheunke manager 
of suburban la grange park village 
illinois corn and soybeans are beginning to show signs of stress 
but look pretty decent considering what the area is going 
through said tom stoutenborogh agricultural adviser in central 
illinois coles county 
weve just got to have rain soon or were going to go 
downhill stoutenborogh added

the white house said today president reagan 
still stands by his star wars antimissile program despite a 
congressional study that says its electronic brains would be so 
large and complex that there is a significant probability they 
would fail 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan has not been 
briefed on the study 
nevertheless fitzwater said suffice to say the president 
still believes in the strategic defense initiative program he 
believes in its potential and certainly has no plans to change our 
policy or our priority status for sdi 
the report tuesday by the congressional office of technology 
assessment is the latest in a series of scientific studies to 
criticize reagans strategic defense initiative as the 5yearold 
program is formally known 
the studys harshest criticism was reserved for the computer 
systems which would be needed for battle management the 
pentagon term for tracking and targeting soviet missiles 
in otas judgment there would be a significant probability 
ie one large enough to take seriously that the first and 
presumably only time the bmd system were used in a real war it 
would suffer a catastrophic failure said the report bmd stands 
for ballistic missile defense 
it added that there is no effective way to test such a system 
and no adequate models for the development production test and 
maintenance of software for fullscale bmd systems exist 
the pentagonbased strategic defense initiative organization 
issued a statement which said the conclusions reflect opinion 
rather than real analysis and are based primarily on extrapolation 
from past experience as opposed to the potential of the newer 
technologies becoming available in sdi research and in the computer 
industry 
the statement also said the ota assertion that strategic 
defense software cannot be tested sufficiently for operational 
confidence short of war is already at variance with several 
decades of developing strategic warning and todays offensive 
missile deterrent systems 
reagan said he wanted his program to have a goal of making 
nuclear weapons obsolete but the pentagon and sdi backers have 
pushed for deployment in the mid1990s of a phase one star wars 
shield that would have a much more limited goal 
pentagon officials last year estimated that it would cost 75 
billion to 150 billion to build a phase one system comprised of 
groundbased rockets and spacebased garages full of missiles 
which could be fired at attacking soviet missiles 
the phase one proposals call for basically using existing 
technology rather than the exotic futuristic technologies such as 
lasers and beam weapons that were a focus of early sdi research 
but the ota report said the soviets could use nucleartipped 
antisatellite weapons which could knock out a phase one sdi 
system the soviets already have an operational asat system 
the soviet asats would pose a significant threat to all three 
defense system phases but particularly to the first two ota 
said such weapons deployed in quantity especially with multiple 
decoys to confuse the us system would threaten to degrade 
severely the performance of a first or secondphase sdi system 
the study said 
the ota report was released despite the pentagons refusal to 
declassify three chapters in the 12chapter document the 
classified chapters dealt with possible countermeasures and tactics 
which could be used against an sdi system 
thomas karas director of the study said he didnt understand 
why the three chapters had been withheld from the public by the 
pentagon they were so general that the soviets could not likely 
gain much military advantage from reading the material he said 
the pentagon statement said the chapters reman difficult to 
declassify and a final decision will be made in the near future 
the report said it was unable to estimate with a precise 
degree how well the us system could survive a soviet attack 
because that would depend on the tactics employed by each side 
and on the evitable uncertainties of battle 
congress has consistently cut reagans requests for sdi 
spending the program receives 39 billion in the current fiscal 
year 
for the 1989 fiscal year beginning oct 1 the senate has voted 
46 billion while the house has approved 35 billion with a 
compromise to be worked out by a senatehouse conference committee 
reagan had sought 48 billion

republican george bush and democrat michael 
dukakis today celebrated victorious conclusions to the long primary 
season with dukakis declaring the marathon is over and now the 
race to the finish line begins jesse jackson renewed his claim 
on the democrats no 2 spot but dukakis said no one is due an 
offer 
both bush and dukakis assured of their parties presidential 
nominations pledged a tough but clean election fight offering 
voters a clear choice 
i feel terrific here i am as the democratic nominee 
dukakis exulted in an interview broadcast today on cbstv 
jackson his last remaining opponent promised in interviews 
broadcast today that he would continue the nomination fight all the 
way to the convention in atlanta but jackson implicitly conceding 
the fight was really over said repeatedly he had earned a dukakis 
offer of the vice presidential spot 
ive earned an option to accept it or turn it down he said 
on cbs in an interview taped earlier on abctv he said 
consideration does mean an offer it does not mean just in 
passing we have earned consideration he did not say whether he 
would accept such an offer 
dukakis making no promises said on abc i dont think anyone 
is due an offer 
he told reporters later in the day im going to cast my net 
far and wide he said jackson deserved consideration but there 
are other people to be considered as well and its up to the 
nominee to make that selection 
in washington today former candidate paul simon said he would 
support dukakis for president and he urged his 150 or so remaining 
delegates to do the same unless they felt strongly they should 
support jackson 
sen simon dill who had put his fading campaign on hold two 
months ago said at a news conference the primaries and caucuses 
are now history the verdict is in i will vote for michael dukakis 
at the convention and will do everything i can to advance his 
candidacy after the convention 
dukakis was also picking up formal support today from former 
rivals richard gephardt of missouri and bruce babbitt of arizona 
the race to the finish line begins proclaimed a jubilant 
dukakis after returns from a fourstate primary sweep guaranteed 
him a delegate majority he won races in california new jersey 
montana and new mexico 
now well be going into the majorleague ballgame and i am 
ready on the issues declared bush who locked up the gop 
nomination more than a month ago and cruised to uncontested wins in 
the states voting tuesday 
dukakis seasonending sweep gave the massachusetts governor 
victories in 30 states the marathon primary contest began with 
seven contenders but over the last two months came down to a 
headtohead battle between dukakis and jackson 
the magic number for a convention majority was 2081 and dukakis 
easily surpassed that with his landslide finale his delegate total 
after tuesdays sweep stood at 2251 according to the latest 
associated press count 
confronted by polls saying dukakis was the current choice of a 
majority of voters bush said im fighting back im the 
underdog now 
while dukakis could enter the race with an edge in polls showing 
americans wanting a change after nearly eight years of ronald 
reagans presidency bush could find strength in the republican 
hold on the electoral votes of southern and western states 
the vice president was meeting this morning in washington with 
reagan 
dukakis said voters were not interested in slashing attacks 
and he warned the republicans not to engage in mudslinging and 
namecalling 
i dont think you have to run a negative nasty campaign 
said bush what i think you have to do though is be sure the 
american people perceive what you really want for this country 
party unity and the search for running mates were top priorities 
for both bush and dukakis as they looked ahead to their party 
conventions the democrats in july the republicans in august 
and beyond 
bush was flying to denver friday to open a unity conference at 
which three of his former rivals for the nomination would appear 
sen bob dole of kansas rep jack kemp of new york and television 
evangelist pat robertson 
campaigning in california for two days before the primary bush 
previewed his fall strategy repeatedly portraying the 
massachusetts governor as a liberal likely to advocate tax 
increases 
michael dukakis said he would not rule out a tax increase 
bush said ill rule it out 
for dukakis jackson remained an unpredictable figure in an 
otherwise smooth road to party unity commanding the loyalty of 
black voters who are a critical part of the democratic partys 
coalition jackson will have more than 1000 delegates at the 
democratic national convention in atlanta dukakis predicted there 
would be a floor fight or two over platform issues but none 
that would split the party 
both bush and dukakis hit rough spots on their drives for the 
presidential nominations of their parties 
on the ropes when the campaign reached new hampshire he staged 
a comeback that shattered doles hopes for a quick knockout then 
on march 8 super tuesday bush swept 16 primaries and effectively 
ended the republican contest 
for dukakis the race started according to plan with a credible 
thirdplace finish in iowa and a strong victory in new hampshire 
victories in texas and florida on super tuesday established his 
credentials as more than a regional candidate from the northeast 
but he stumbled in illinois and again in michigan 
however dukakis then put together the string of victories that 
quieted such speculation and put him in command of the race 
in the final contests dukakis defeated jackson by margins of 
better than 2 to 1 in new jersey new mexico and montana returns 
from california were putting him ahead in that state by a 
comparable margin 
in new jersey with returns from 99 percent of the precincts 
counted dukakis had 405639 or 63 percent jackson had 209762 or 
33 percent with 100 percent counted bush had 236140 for 94 
percent 
in new mexico with returns from 97 percent of the precincts it 
was dukakis 109957 or 61 percent to jacksons 49797 or 28 
percent bush had 78 percent of the vote translating into 65733 
votes from 97 percent of the precincts 
in montana with returns from 99 percent of the precincts 
dukakis had 82034 or 69 percent jackson had 26571 or 22 
percent bush had 73 percent or 62395 votes 
in california with 97 percent of the precincts counted dukakis 
had 1798759 or 61 percent jackson had 1049895 or 35 percent 
bush had 83 percent or 1840053

jordans king hussein unconditionally 
supported the palestine liberation organization today and asked 
oilrich arab states to help pay for the continuing struggle 
against israel 
on the second day of the arab summit hussein disclaimed any 
ambition to restore jordanian rule in the israelioccupied west 
bank he insisted that the plo must represent the palestinian 
people at any future international peace conference 
speaking behind closed doors to the leaders of the plo and 20 
arab nations hussein endorsed some aspects of secretary of state 
george shultzs middle east peace plan but declared 
the united states has no middle east policy other than support 
for israel the us approach to the problem of the arabisraeli 
conflict is unfortunately based on a policy of crisismanagement 
the united states takes no political steps or initiatives 
unless there has been a recent eruption in the region taking on the 
aspect of a war 
hussein said arab nations should support the palestinian 
uprising in the west bank and gaza strip in an organized and 
effective manner and ensure that it continues until it achieves its 
objectives 
copies of husseins comments were made available by the 
jordanian delegation 
hussein who has been lukewarm in his support for the plo in the 
past repeatedly stressed his wholehearted acceptance of the 
guerrilla organization as the sole legitimate representative of 
the palestinian people 
the threeday arab league meeting was convened to support the 
palestinian uprising which began in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip dec 8 
in jerusalem today israeli foreign minister shimon peres mocked 
the arab leaders for supporting the uprising there is nothing 
more fractious for the arab people than their show of unity he 
said 
are they really united around the intefadeh peres asked in 
parliament using the arabic word for uprising do they mean to 
say iran and iraq are fighting a war over the intefadeh and that in 
lebanon all the factions are also fighting over the intefadeh what 
kind of show is this 
plo leader yassir arafat wearing his usual kefiyeh 
headscarf and battle fatigues told the arab leaders on tuesday 
that our people swear before you to continue the struggle and the 
intefadeh until victory 
he reiterated the plos determination to create a sovereign 
palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital israel has 
proclaimed jerusalem as the capital of the jewish state and pledged 
never to give up any part of it 
the summits opening session tuesday was marked by the walkout 
of the iranian ambassador to algeria algerian newspapers carried 
many pages of detailed coverage of the summit but there was no 
mention of the iranian ambassadors walkout 
the ambassador zargar yaghoubi abruptly rose from his seat in 
the diplomats section and walked out of the hall during an address 
by chedli klibi tunisian secretary general of the arab league 
while speaking on the intefadeh for which we meet we cannot 
ignore the victory of brother iraq which has recovered its 
territories notably the faw peninsula klibi said 
iraq has always been prepared to cooperate with international 
peace efforts while irans leaders are determined to pursue the 
war which increasingly threatens neighboring saudi arabia and 
kuwait klibi declared 
a spokesman for the iranian embassy confirmed that yaghoubi 
walked out of the opening session in protest against incorrect 
statements on the 7yearold persian gulf war 
president saddam hussein of iraq is one of the few top arab

fullpage advertisement for time that appeared in todays editions

the white house spokesman at first said that a member of the 
staff had requested the autograph for a friend who collects 
autographed pictures he said this request was sent to moscow by 
mail before the summit and he did not believe the president was 
involved 
after the briefing however fitzwater sought out reporters to 
give them a corrected account 
he said that kenneth m duberstein deputy white house chief of 
staff asked reagan if he could get the magazine cover autographed 
as a favor for a friend and the president did so he said the 
incident occurred immediately after the formal farewell ceremony in 
moscow

an airline passenger who was forced to send 
her husbands ashes through the baggage checkin rather than carry 
them aboard won the right to sue trans world airlines for damages 
after the luggage was lost 
dorothy t coughlin 67 had sued twa for 78000 in 1985 but a 
federal judge ruled the airline was liable for only 1250 under a 
tariff limitation 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned that decision 
tuesday and ruled that coughlins case should go to trial 
the ashes were lost after a flight to boston where her husband 
had wanted the remains buried in his family plot 
hes still missing said coughlins lawyer marc levine 
it was devastating to her can you imagine the embarrassment 
and grief of literally losing your husband 
the appeals court ruled that a twa ticket agent violated airline 
policy by telling coughlin she had to pack the cremated remains in 
her suitcase airline policy says valuables should be carried 
aboard 
as a result the airline cant expect to be protected by the 
1250 liability limit said the court 
the cremated remains were unquestionably valuable and there 
is nothing in the record to suggest carriage of human ashes on 
board was prohibited they wrote 
twas lawyer james m derr was out of town and could not be 
reached for comment

the columbian vancouver wash on the reagangorbachev summit 
experts observers officials and others in the instantwisdom 
business are generally clustering under a consensus that the 
recently concluded summit meetings in moscow didnt produce much of 
weight or import 
was the summit therefore not worth the considerable cost 
intense public attention and persistent anxiety that something 
might go awry 
although the speeches reagan had read earlier in helsinki and 
other stops on the trip toward the kremlin were out of the old 
mold the president saw a new and different world in the faces of 
actual soviet citizens 
fortunately for the survival of humankind the president got 
nearer the truth when he predicted that the united states and the 
soviet union would not go to war if the youth of both nations could 
meet and mingle and get to know one another 
the conversations between reagan and gorbachev upset the tough 
guys in both camps but the rest of us are justified in sleeping a 
little easier

fergus falls minn daily journal on the reagangorbachev 
summit 
it was something many americans never expected to see president 
reagan standing in the kremlin saying he no longer considered the 
soviet union to be the evil empire 
that description of the soviet union made by reagan five years 
ago has characterized ussoviet negotiations since that time 
reagan and gorbachev did not emerge from their four days of 
meetings with major breakthroughs on major issues such as arms 
control 
but some events were impressive nonetheless such as the 
soviets willingness to consider discussion of human rights 
every summit need not conclude with grand results in fact 
there is as much danger is being rushed into agreements on arms 
control as there is in delaying them 
its not unreasonable for leaders to first talk then reach 
agreements later

indians and his ineptitude during a talk with students in the 
soviet union 
sadly he is not alone with those traits among his immigrant 
compatriots in the united states 
reagan said that allowing indians to maintain their culture on 
reservations might have been a mistake 
maybe we should not have humored them in that wanting to stay 
in that kind of primitive lifestyle maybe we should have said 
no come join us be citizens along with the rest of us the

husbands and wives may not testify in court about 
their private conversations even when both agree to do so and when 
it would help their cause massachusetts highest court ruled 
in a unanimous ruling tuesday that rejected a medical 
malpractice claim the massachusetts supreme court also upheld the 
commonlaw doctrine that prevents husbands and wives from repeating 
in public what they said to each other in private 
the justices called the rule outmoded and said they were 
upholding it reluctantly only because state law left them no 
choice 
the decision came in an appeal of a case in middlesex superior 
court in which a jury exonerated dr garry a goldstein from 
charges of medical malpractice brought by john gallagher a former 
natick resident on behalf of his wife 
haline gallagher suffered a cereberal hemorrhage in 1981 that 
left her brain damaged and nearly quadriplegic in his suit 
gallagher charged that his wifes condition was the result of the 
doctors faulty diagnosis 
at trial the doctor testified that mrs gallagher described her 
headache as moderate her husband wished to testify that she 
told him otherwise but he was not allowed to take the stand 
its a tragedy gallaghers attorney jan schlichtmann 
said the court had the opportunity to correct a tragic 
injustice 
schlichtmann noted that if the gallaghers had been living 
together outside of marriage or if they had been divorced 
gallagher could have testified 
under a state law enacted in 1851 any person of sufficient 
understanding may testify except for criminal defendants who 
choose not to testify and a few other cases among them the law 
says neither husband nor wife shall testify as to private 
conversations with the other 
the court said the law means that contents of private 
conversations are absolutely excluded 
citing a scholarly law article the court said there were five 
reasons for the rule including that a married couple has only one 
interest so no point would be served by having one spouse testify 
for or against the other and that a spouse has a bias of 
affection and would not testify truthfully 
according to schlichtmann gallagher is a retired postal 
inspector who has moved to las vegas nev where he helps provide 
the elaborate nursing care his wife requires

westerly ri sun drug seizures on the high seas 
along donttheyhaveanythingbettertodo lines was the coast 
guards reward when it seized the yacht ark royal after finding 
traces of marijuana aboard 
there was more grumping when the charter yacht monkey 
business also was seized after the discovery of a single 
marijuana cigarette 
the coast guard was only the instrument of an overzealous new 
drug law enforcement policy to confiscate upon finding even the 
tiniest scraps of any illegal drug 
in their eagerness authorities overreacted and ignored 
the cherished principle that punishment should fit the crime 
common sense has come to the rescue under new guidelines 
possession of small amounts of drugs will no longer result in 
seizure 
but if there is evidence that a vessel is being used for drug 
trafficking it will be seized that is a fair and reasonable 
policy

the miami herald on the drug war 
the drug war has two main fronts both extremely evil 
at one end drug consumption is corroding values of american 
society at the other end drug trafficking is undermining 
democratic institutions in supplier nations 
colombia is losing its war to a deadly combination of drug 
trafficking and a violent leftist insurgency government officials 
judges journalists and law enforcement officers often have had to 
choose between death and surrender 
in choosing surrender they have increased traffickers power 
incalculably 
the reagan administration should call upon all nations of the 
hemisphere to join the united states in a task force against drugs 
this group should assess the mutual threat calmly without 
recriminations as to whether us consumers or latin american drug 
suppliers are most to blame for the crisis 
then it should devise a common strategy diplomatic military 
and judicial for fighting the drug menace in unison

as you may have noticed present accommodations are not exactly 
topnotch and in crash landings seats often break loose clogging 
the aisles and resulting in increased deaths and injuries 
the faas plan is to require replacement of all seats over the

chapel paintings without a bible teaching world history without 
explaining the role religion has played 
the organization which includes the national education 
association and the national council of churches has provided 
guidelines for schools to use in discussions about religion with 
students 
they dont want schools to preach but teach an academic 
approach to religion thats part of any healthy intellectual 
endeavor 
in restricting prayer in the classroom and turning down 
creationism laws the courts never meant to outlaw discussions 
about religions they meant to exclude only narrow definitions of 
religion that give emphasis to one religion over another 
these guidelines attempt to encourage the academic pursuit of 
understanding religion that should always be welcome

the philadelphia inquirer on george bushs budget plan 
in his quest to be more than an echo of president reagan george 
bush has managed only a shade of difference on taxes and spending 
in 1980 reagan made such specific campaign promises notably a 
defense buildup and a huge tax cut that everybody knew he couldnt 
keep his promise to balance the budget in 1983 
bush who is promising a balanced budget for 1993 while vowing 
to cut taxes and increase some spending along the way has stayed 
vague enough to sound almost plausible 
but in its theme of painless gain bushs semisecret plan to 
end the deficit suggests alchemy the ancient hope of making gold 
from cheap metals 
that was a hard trick to pull off and so is bushs plan for 
balancing the budget with tax cuts and higher spending

stevens point wis journal on the great lakes water level 
not so long ago people were worried about the rising levels 
of the great lakes and the damage this was doing to buildings and 
other things along the shores 
all sorts of emergency measures were being proposed to lower the 
levels before chicago detroit and cleveland disappeared beneath 
the waves 
after all there was evidence that the lakes had been several 
feet higher some centuries earlier and there was speculation that 
that might have been the normal level 
some skeptics suggested that steps to lower the lakes might be 
risky and ineffective 
in the meantime the skeptics suggested wet weather might taper 
off and the problem could correct itself 
in the paper recently there have been stories that said in 
effect that the problem has corrected itself at least as far as 
lakes superior and michigan are concerned and the level has 
dropped so far that navigation in channels and harbors is posing 
some difficulties 
but for the moment we can be grateful that a couple of billion 
dollars wasnt spent on crash programs to eliminate one of those 
nonproblems

vietnam occupies cambodia and laos threatens thailand and 
alarms china vietnam also costs the soviet union billions of 
dollars in annual subsidies 
its economy is a shambles its inflation legendary and its 
political leadership in disarray agriculture is so dreadful in the 
northern more communist part of the country that hanoi says three 
million vietnamese are near starvation 
that is the context in which hanoi announced that it would 
withdraw 50000 troops from occupied cambodia this year and the 
remaining 50000 to 75000 by 1990 it also pledged to withdraw 
troops from laos 
whether the pullout is genuine remains to be seen but moscow 
wants it 
cambodianization of cambodias security problem is probably 
possible the vietnamese and government forces have succeeded 
pretty well in driving khmer rouge and rightwing insurgents across 
the thai border 
vietnam should not only be compelled but allowed to keep its 
word about troop withdrawal vietnamese cambodian and laotian 
people would all benefit

sen paul simon finally jumped on the michael 
dukakis bandwagon wednesday formally ending his own dormant quest 
for the democratic presidential nomination and nudging his 
remaining delegates toward the certain nominee 
the illinois senator who had already seen roughly 40 of his 184 
delegates defect in the past month promised to do everything i 
can to get dukakis elected 
the primaries and caucuses are now history the verdict is 
in said simon dukakis clearly is more sensitive to the 
fundamental needs of our nation than george bush 
in a bow to supporters of another illinois hopeful jesse 
jackson who were angered when simon suspended his campaign in 
april instead of ending it the senator said only i will urge 
delegates who have no strong commitment in any other direction to 
vote for michael dukakis 
he said the massachusetts governors greatest asset was that 
he was himself he didnt try to become something else hes 
genuine hes not phony i think somehow that came across 
echoing themes he built his own campaign around simon said 
michael dukakis has to make clear that he has a positive 
program of jobs for quality education for longterm care for 
moving away from the arms race for things our party traditionally 
has stood for 
i want to use whatever influence i have for the causes that my 
delegates and i support he said 
he said he supports jacksons call for language in the 
democratic platform denouncing south africa as a terrorist state a 
position dukakis has been reluctant to take 
simon suspended his faltering campaign on april 7 instead of 
ending it because i thought it would be a brokered convention 
he explained 
that prospect quickly evaporated conventional wisdom has 
conventionally been wrong on just about everything said simon 
speaking at a news conference at democratic national committee 
headquarters he said the party was more unified than at any time 
since 1964 
he said he was 99 percent certain his first run for the 
presidency was also his last simon who is up for reelection in 
1990 said i dont want to be a harold stassen a reference 
to the perennial candidate from minnesota 
simon expressed little interest in the no 2 spot on the ticket 
jackson has earned consideration but the vice presidency is not 
a blue ribbon or a red ribbon you give to someone who comes in 
second in a race he said 
simons hopes were buoyed by a close finish behind richard 
gephardt in iowas caucuses last february he finished third in new 
hampshire but sat out the super tuesday primaries across the south 
and never recovered 
he encountered skepticism about how he would juggle his promised 
public works education and longterm care progams with a pledge to 
balance the budget in three years 
simons campaign is 450000 in debt spokesman david carle said

michael dukakis said wednesday im going to 
cast my net far and wide for a democratic running mate with 
jesse jackson just one of those who will be considered 
dukakis who clinched the presidential nomination by sweeping 
the final four democratic primaries on tuesday told reporters 
its the 8th of june the process of selecting a running mate 
will begin 
jackson has been saying ever more clearly that he feels his 
secondplace primarycampaign finish has earned him first chance at 
the vice presidential spot he underlined that wednesday saying 
consideration does mean an offer it does not mean just in 
passing 
dukakis said at a news conference that jackson deserves 
consideration but there are other people to be considered as 
well and its up to the nominee to make that selection 
this is a decision the nominee has to make he told 
reporters at his hotel before leaving for home 
the massachusetts governor called his successful campaign a 
steady march to the nomination and said it had included a 
remarkable run of victories 
he was to stop in st louis on the way home to pick up the 
formal support of a vanquished rival rep richard gephardt dmo 
earlier in the day another former presidential foe sen paul 
simon of illinois gave his endorsement in washington 
dukakis took several jabs at his likely november opponent 
republican george bush during the los angeles news conference in 
particular he took issue with the vice presidents comparing this 
years general election race to what bush said was the clear choice 
in 1972 between democrat george mcgovern and republican richard 
nixon 
i heard a lot of labels yesterday dukakis said i think 
its a very serious mistake to run that kind of campaign he said 
it was absurd to compare this year to 1972 
this race is about the 90s he said its about the 
future 
dukakis said the most important factor in choosing a vice 
presidential candidate would be to pick someone who would be a good 
president if needed 
he said he would select a running mate through a good 
thoughtful deliberative process and hoped to have a very good 
idea of who that will be before the democratic national 
convention in july 
dukakis said he did not know whether he would have personal 
interviews with potential running mates 
asked if a woman was on his list dukakis said theres no 
list at present 
he repeated his statement that there are no deep and dividing 
issues in our party and said he had no ideological litmus test 
for a running mate 
im not looking for a clone of michael dukakis im looking 
for someone who will do the job well and be an asset to the 
ticket he said 
dukakis said he hopes to be in as many states as possible 
during the fall campaign but stopped short of promising hed visit 
each one 
asked if he expected to receive jacksons support dukakis said 
yes i do 
he said he spoke with jackson tuesday night and agreed to talk 
further he congratulated me and i congratulated him he said

a defense lawyer argued today that the 
drowning of a navy recruit during training march 2 was an accident 
and suggested higher authorities were to blame for poor supervision 
of the program 
retired capt ferdinand salomon representing lt thomas a 
torchia led off closing arguments in a hearing to determine 
whether his client commander of the navy rescue swimmer school 
and five enlisted instructors should face courtmartial in the 
death of airman recruit lee mirecki 
it was a tragic accident salomon said this unfortunate 
incident has been blown out of all proportion by the media some 
good is going to come of this but not by pillorying the fine young 
man at this table 
the lawyer argued at the military proceeding that the navy has 
refused repeated requests to release reports on the last two 
inspections made of the school in 1983 and 1986 torchia took 
command earlier this year 
why does the navy have something to hide salomon asked 
did they find everything wonderful at the school or did they 
just forget about the school entirely 
he said that rescue swimmers are an elite group and that higher 
authorities should have had interest in their training 
torchia is charged with dereliction of duty and the five 
instructors petty officers 1st class richard e blevins and david 
j smith and petty officers 2nd class john w zelenock frankie d 
deaton and michael w combe are accused of involuntary 
manslaughter and conspiracy 
the instructors are accused of forcing the 19yearold recruit 
from appleton wis into the water when he tried to quit the 
course a second time 
a pathologist said mirecki had a phobia about being pulled under 
water and was scared to death 
on tuesday the final witness john w singer the schools top 
chief petty officer testified that mirecki was allowed to resume 
the water rescue course without taking a required medical exam 
you cannot legally return to training status until that 
physical is held singer told the investigating officer cmdr 
daniel j dalesio jr 
mirecki initially asked to drop out of the course a month before 
his death a flight surgeon diagnosed the phobia and found him 
unfit for training but a psychologist subsequently disagreed 
mirecki who later asked he be reinstated in the course was 
erroneously restored to the training on the basis of the 
psychologists finding but without the required physical and the 
flight surgeons approval testimony disclosed 
prosecutors on tuesday also introduced training records in an 
effort to show torchia and the instructors knew or should have 
known about mireckis phobia and psychological examination 
conway testified that the records were available to the 
defendants in the schools office and that blevins had signed a 
counseling sheet including comments by mirecki 
the recruit wrote that when he was 5 years old his brother 
threw him in the water and had to rescue him i dont want to go 
through that again mirecki wrote

a private study group says an independent 
oversight agency for the nations 16 major nuclear weapons plants 
should be created because mismanagement has allowed radioactive 
contamination of air soil and water 
the radioactive waste campaign a selfstyled public interest 
group based in new york city made the recommendation in a letter 
to members of congress the letter was released the same day the 
group released a 170page report which charged there are dangerous 
levels of radioactive pollution at all 16 of the energy 
departments main production facilities for nuclear weapons 
the twoyear study by nine researchers concluded there is a 
pattern of gross mismanagement by the department which is allowing 
radioactivity to leak out of the sites through soil water and air 
in many cases intentionally 
many of the problems cited by the report have long been 
acknowledged by the energy department and have been the subjects of 
several blistering reviews by the general accounting office but 
the independent study is the most wideranging report yet published 
on the issue and suggests cleanup costs will exceed the energy 
departments estimate of 100 billion 
the energy department referred calls on the subject to the 
office of an official who was not immediately available for comment 
tuesday 
among key examples of contamination cited by the report 
at the hanford reservation in southeastern washington billions 
of gallons of radioactive water are routinely pumped into the 
ground each year an underground plume of radioactivity stretches 
six miles to the columbia river one of the worlds premier salmon 
runs and an irrigation source for two states 
at the savannah river plant in south carolina millions of 
gallons of radioactive fluids are poured into seepage basins 
actually designed to leak at a steady rate strontium90 which can 
cause bone cancer and leukemia is entering surface water at rates 
43000 times above the governments standard for drinking water 
the report charges further that atlantas water supply is 
threatened by toxic chemicals from the site 
at the feed material production center in fernald ohio 
uranium is contaminating suburban cincinnatis water supply 
at the nevada test site underground nuclear explosions are 
contaminating underground water supplies and radioactive fallout 
has drifted as far as salt lake city 
plutonium one of the most carcinogenic materials known has 
been dispersed into the air or water at weapons facilities near 
dayton ohio santa fe nm and denver 
at oak ridge tenn where three plants are based 35 million 
pounds of uranium are sitting in the ground so theres uranium in 
the runoff in streams and a large amount of uranium put into the 
air resnikoff said thats the largest store of uranium anywhere 
in the country he said 
the group in its letter to congress also called for an 
immediate halt to dumping of radioactive wastes into the ground 
and urged the weapons sites be given top priority for cleanup it 
also called for creation of an independent oversight agency for the 
weapons plants 
the 16 sites covered by the study are 
savannah river plant near aiken sc 
three facilities at oak ridge tenn the y12 plant oak ridge 
national laboratory oak ridge gaseous diffusion plant 
portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant in portsmouth ohio 
feed materials production center in fernald ohio 
mound laboratories in miamisburg ohio 
paducah ky gaseous diffusion plant 
pantex plant amarillo texas

lawrence livermore national laboratory livermore calif 
idaho national engineering laboratory idaho falls idaho 
hanford reservation in hanford wash 
marvin resnikoff a nuclear physicist said the nine who 
performed the study reviewed several hundred energy department 
documents and visited some of the sites 
the radioactive waste campaign issues a quarterly newspaper that 
is sent to 13000 members it has five fulltime staff members and 
some parttime workers resnikoff said

new york citys biggest law firm has announced a 
10 million program to place lawyers just out of law school in 
public service organizations where they will represent the poor in 
civil cases 
skadden arps slate meagher amp flom said tuesday that it will 
pay the salaries of 125 young lawyers willing to spend their first 
two years after law school working for the poor 
this will tend to contradict the view that the established bar 
has about large law firms the view that we take from society and 
do not give back said an executive partner peter p mullen 
we have been successful and we have made money and we have 
decided to put some of it back 
the program also will instill in the lawyers a taste for pro 
bono public benefit work said mullen 
last year skadden arps was reported by the american lawyer to 
have had the highest earnings of the nations law firms founded 40 
years ago it has 177 partners and 675 associates and offices in 
seven us cities london and tokyo 
unlike criminal defendants poor people who are deprived of 
civil or human rights are not guaranteed counsel by the 
constitution 
the program will take the form of fellowships that pay about 
32500 a year plus fringe benefits comparable to secondyear 
salaries of federal judicial clerks said skadden arps the firm 
will also help repay student loans 
beginning associates at skadden arps earn more than 70000 a 
year entering lawyers in legalservices offices earn an average of 
slightly more than 25000 
twentyfive lawyers starting next june will be named each year 
for the next five years the lawyers will be under no obligation to 
return to the firm

a black woman who has refused to testify about 
her daughters alleged abduction and rape by six whites sought 
sanctuary in a church this morning to avoid arrest for contempt of 
court 
glenda brawley her two attorneys and two bodyguards entered the 
ebenezer baptist church in queens about 6 am according to the 
rev al sharpton who also was with mrs brawley 
the rev timothy mitchell invited us to be here to seek 
religious asylum and sanctuary said c vernon mason one of mrs 
brawleys attorneys were prepared to stay here as long as it 
takes 
police made no immediate attempt to arrest mrs brawley and were 
nowhere to be seen outside the modern church which dominates the 
industrial neighborhood with its orange stainedglass spire and 
stainless steel cross 
we dont know what were going to do yet said sgt ed 
burns a police spokesman 
the 33yearold mrs brawley will not answer the judges call 
or the attorney generals call sharpton said reading from a 
statement outside the church she will answer a higher call 
today 
however mrs brawleys attorneys backed off from their earlier 
contention that police could not legally arrest mrs brawley inside 
a church 
andrew schnier of the new york state bar associations criminal 
justice section said there was no state or common law that would 
preclude authorities from executing an arrest warrant inside a 
religious institution 
the front door to the church was guarded by a welldressed man 
who screened parishioners showing up to participate in the churchs 
day care and senior citizen programs reporters were turned away 
mrs brawleys daughter tawana was found nov 28 four days 
after she had disappeared the 16yearold was lying dazed in a 
plastic bag in wappingers falls about 10 miles south of 
poughkeepsie her hair had been shorn animal excrement had been 
smeared on her body and racial epithets had been scrawled on her 
torso 
she said she had been attacked by six white men one of whom 
flashed a policelike badge 
neither miss brawley nor her family has cooperated with 
investigators or made public more details claiming that state 
officials are involved in a racially motivated coverup 
on monday judge angelo ingrassia of dutchess county sentenced 
mrs brawley to 30 days in jail and fined her 250 for defying a 
grand jury subpoena to testify in an investigation led by state 
attorney general robert abrams 
authorities on tuesday issued a statewide warrant for mrs 
brawley saying she was fair game for arrest 
mrs brawley took sanctuary in a black church rather than appear 
before a grand jury in poughkeepsie this morning her daughter was 
not at the church this morning 
you dont mess with black people in their churches said 
mrs brawleys sister juanita 
sharpton this morning issued a direct challenge to abrams 
saying theres nothing legally stopping you from coming in here 
so show the nation the moral beast you are and come through these 
doors and arrest her 
abrams spokesman tim gilles said whether shes arrested 
today tomorrow glenda brawley is no particular threat to public 
safety or public order if they they sheriffs office were to 
wait a few days we have no objection to that 
abrams and gilles were in poughkeepsie where the grand jury 
probe continued 
sharpton reiterated claims of a coverup this morning and called 
again for abrams to step aside and for gov mario cuomo to appoint 
a special prosecutor he also hinted that miss brawley would 
cooperate with an impartial prosecutor

frustrated by a ban on importing chimpanzees 
us officials are looking into shifting aids tests on the animals 
to africa and the soviet union a move experts call a needless 
death blow to the last chimps in the wild 
this is very very bad said jane goodall a leading 
chimpanzee specialist who was recently in washington to alert 
legislators to the unannounced program it is not a choice of 
aids or chimps enough can be bred in captivity 
sen john melcher dmont a veterinarian has threatened to 
block such a move 
the director of the national institutes of health james 
wyngaarden confirmed in an interview that the government agency is 
considering aids research projects in africa and the soviet union 
because us law bans importation of chimpanzees 
we clearly dont want to get into an international fracas over 
seeming to subvert rules that apply in this country wyngaarden 
said but he added were taking lots of looks at africa 
he provided no specifics but confidential minutes obtained by 
the associated press show that nih decided quietly in march to 
identify target groups of african chimpanzees and explore means of 
using them in research 
according to the minutes an nih committee decided to develop 
an african chimp field survey to provide us with the numbers of 
animals serological blood information and their condition 
possible sites for research include a laboratory in liberia 
operated by the new york blood center and the sukhumi center in 
soviet georgia which would have to import chimps since 
specialists say it now has none 
chimps which were instrumental in developing a hepatitis b 
vaccine are valuable research subjects because their genetic 
material varies less than 1 percent from mans in current 
research scientists are injecting chimps with experimental 
vaccines for aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
wyngaarden said nih scientists want more chimpanzees than are 
available but are thwarted by the us endangered species act and 
the 14yearold convention on international trade in endangered 
species a treaty that prohibits trade in animals threatened with 
extinction 
experts fear that once in africa researchers would have access 
to chimpanzees smuggled illegally across borders from endangered 
colonies sometimes with false documentation 
goodall said new chimpanzee roundups during which hunters often 
kill adults in order to get at the young would not only have a 
devastating effect on chimpanzees but would bring them to 
extinction 
an average of 10 mothers and babies are killed for every infant 
chimp successfully exported she said in a telephone interview from 
england 
goodall and eight eminent american and european biomedical 
experts wrote to nature magazine saying that although chimpanzees 
were essential to aids research enough could be bred for 
laboratory purposes 
going to africa is no solution said marc girard of the 
pasteur institute in paris we must breed more better use those 
we have and find alternatives 
geza teleki an american primatologist who heads a 
washingtonbased international specialist group the committee for 
conservation and care of chimpanzees said too little has been done 
to breed captive chimps 
the bottom line is competition for the few chimpanzees still 
hanging on in africa and to hell with all the national and 
international laws protecting them teleki contended 
a 1978 chimpanzee census commissioned by nih showed chimp 
populations extinct or depleted across much of their traditional 
african range the unpublished census was made public recently by 
teleki an other specialists 
most chimpanzees in medical research originated in west africa 
where their number has dropped this century from a million to about 
17000 teleki said outside of west africa he said only zairean 
and south african authorities control large groups of chimps 
the nih clearly intends to continue being an accomplice in 
driving the species to extinction beyond the view of the american 
public teleki asserted 
sen melcher said he opposed such a transfer of us chimpanzee 
research to africa 
nih is going to have to abide by international agreement 
melcher said warning that congress could block any move 
offshore by inserting restrictions in nih appropriations 
the number of chimpanzees already used in us research is in 
dispute 
wyngaarden said only 400 to 600 chimps are available and the 
infant mortality is 30 percent in breeding centers used by nih 
but jan moorjankowski director of lemsip a large 
primateresearch facility in new york challenged the figures 
saying nih has access to 800 animals more than 100 are born each 
year and that number could be increased

a method previously used to help diagnose 
cancer and other diseases also can predict the odds that cancer 
cells from breast or colon tumors will spread through the body a 
researcher says 
there are two big problems in cancer early detection and 
when youve found a tumor what is the prognosis said chemist 
ian cp smith of the national research council in ottawa canada 
what i am reporting is the use of a chemical technique 
that will help the medical profession with both of those 
problems said smith who outlined his findings tuesday in 
toronto during the third chemical congress of north america the 
los angeles times reported smiths findings wednesday 
if the technique shows a tumor will not spread or metastasize 
the tumor can be surgically removed without the need for 
debilitating radiation or chemotherapy smith said 
it also might help doctors avoid unnecessary radical 
mastectomies in which surgeons remove a cancerous breast lymph 
nodes in the armpit and muscles linking the upper chest and 
shoulder he added 
doctors now make a subjective judgment about whether a cancer 
will spread based on the size of the tumor and the appearance of 
tumor cells under a microscope 
the method cited by smith is known as nuclear magnetic resonance 
nmr spectroscopy which is a variation on nmr imaging also known 
as magnetic resonance imaging 
despite their name nmr imaging machines dont involve 
radiation as do xray machines and produce images of much higher 
quality they have been used to detect tumors subtle signs of 
parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis and various disease 
processes in the heart liver and kidneys 
chemists have used nmr spectroscopy for more than 30 years to 
determine the structure of molecules when a chemical is placed in 
the nmr devices powerful magnetic field and bombarded with 
radiofrequency energy scientists can deduce the structure of the 
chemical by measuring which frequencies of energy are absorbed 
smith and caroline e mountfors of australias university of 
sydney found rat tumors that got rid of the absorbed energy 
extremely rapidly never metatasized while those that shed the 
energy slowly had a high probability of spreading to other sites in 
the rats bodies 
studies of breast and colon tumors removed from 167 patients at 
ottawa general hospital and ottawa civic hospital during the past 
three years confirmed the value of the method smith said 
there has been no spread of cancer in 25 patients whose tumors 
shed absorbed energy quickly while all the others whose excised 
tumors got rid of energy slowly either had metastases at the time 
of surgery or developed them later he said

libyan leader moammar gadhafi created an 
uproar at the arab summit on wednesday accusing unidentified arab 
leaders of being lackeys of imperialism conference sources 
reported 
chedli klibi secretary general of the 21member arab league 
described the session as stormy he declined to give details 
gadhafi distributed the text of a statement to the arab leaders 
before the start of wednesdays closed session and then refused to 
enter the meeting hall the session was held in the closely guarded 
aurassi hotel 
witnesses said the libyan leader wore one white glove as he 
walked up and down on a terrace of the hotel overlooking algiers 
harbor while the chiefs of state were inside waiting for him to 
join them 
members of the libyan delegation explained that the glove was 
to avoid touching some of the other chiefs of state with whom he 
may have to shake hands 
tunisian president zine el abidine ben ali went out on the 
terrace to try to persuade gadhafi to join the meeting but was 
rebuffed said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
klibi then joined gadhafi and finally persuaded him to come into 
the meeting room arriving at his seat the maverick libyan leader 
delivered an impromptu diatribe even more violent than his 
prepared statement the sources said 
details of his remarks or of the statement were not immediately 
available but sources said it accused some of the chiefs of state 
at the summit of being lackeys of imperialism dedicated to 
undermining the arab cause 
gadhafi told the libyan news agency jana on the eve of the 
summit that some of the arab leaders whom he did not name were 
attending the summit with explicit instructions from the us 
state department 
the sources said some of the other leaders raised immediate 
protests 
we have no business beating about the bush sources quoted 
gadhafi as saying the one and only enemy of all the arabs is the 
united states 
shortly before king hussein of jordan told the summit of his 
close relationship with the united states and his partial 
endorsement of secretary of state george p shultzs peace plan 
several members of other delegations expressed indignation at 
gadhafis attack but they refused to be quoted 
the summit is ostensibly dedicated to achieving arab unity on 
material and financial support for the 6monthold palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied territories 
before leaving tripoli on monday gadhafi said he would not 
tolerate any divergence from this limited onepoint agenda 
although several arab leaders were determined to raise other issues 
such as the war between iran and iraq 
several leaders including king hussein have reiterated the 
general arab support for iraq at the summit the iranian ambassador 
to algeria zargar yaghoubi walked out of the opening public 
session of the threeday summit in protest of similar remarks by 
klibi

federal officials have cited the pacific 
engineering plant in henderson for 123 health and safety violations 
since 1974 the las vegas reviewjournal reported wednesday 
the federal occupational safety and health administration 
released the records after the newspaper requested them under the 
federal freedom of information act 
connie richardson a spokeswoman for the company said pacific 
engineering would not comment 
the plant was destroyed may 4 in a series of blasts that killed 
two people injured 326 and caused 73 million in property damage 
a december 1975 inspection turned up 20 violations including 
use of an inappropriate truck in an area containing combustible 
dust a june 1983 inspection turned up 38 violations including 
failing to have water or a shower near anhydrous ammonia systems 
a may 1983 inspection resulted in 30 violations the biggest of 
which was failing to mark the rated load of a crane 
at least two inspections resulted from accidents at the plant 
state officials have said the number of citations is 
moderate for a company of the size and activity of pacific 
engineering 
meanwhile clark county commissioners have endorsed a proposal 
calling for changes in zoning regulations to provide the county 
better control over hazardous materials one target would be an 
industrial complex at henderson 
the complex includes kerrmcgee chemical corp which 
manufactures the same rocket fuel oxidizer produced nearby at 
pacific engineering the two were the only plants in the country 
that produced the critical rocket fuel oxidizer used in the space 
shuttle and military rockets 
federal officials have announced plans to pay the companies a 
surcharge on the oxidizer to allow kerrmcgee to expand and pacific 
engineering to rebuild 
kerrmcgee halted production on the ammonium perchlorate may 12 
pending safety studies no startup date has been announced

demands by hardline radical students 
for reunification with north korea and their show of admiration for 
life in the communist north have stunned south korea 
south koreans cannot understand why idealistic and privileged 
students are reaching out to one of the most oppressive and 
regimented regimes in the world many people in the south also see 
the north as a military menace and fear the threat of invasion 
people just do not know what these students are thinking 
there is a sense that something has gone wrong with our nation 
said a south korean editor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
reunification of the divided korean peninsula is a highly 
emotional issue most south koreans hope for a return to unity but 
fear the north is determined to impose its rule 
the radical students have taken up the cause of reunification 
insisting they are not communists but nationalists attempting to 
reunite the two nations at all costs they say unity is a goal that 
overrides other considerations including ideological differences 
the radicals claim the united states enforces division of the 
peninsula and rules the south as a colony 
yankee go home and drive out the yankee imperialists 
have become the main chants at radical protests 
up to 40000 radical students planned to march to north korea to 
meet with northern students friday to force immediate unification 
the south korean government banned the march 
wall posters put up by radicals on college campuses praise north 
korea as a peaceful nation and a model of korean life north 
koreanstyle propaganda pictures show happy workers and peasants 
working and living in the north 
student protesters have also started to use slogans from north 
korean radio propaganda broadcasts such as destroy the fascist 
clique and fighters for liberation 
some antiamerican slogans echo north korean propaganda which 
portrays the south as a slave colony occupied by us troops and a 
puppet regime wall posters repeat north koreas claim the united 
states is preparing to invade the north 
about 42000 us troops are based in the south under a mutual 
defense treaty most south koreans still haunted by memories of 
north koreas invasion of the south in 1950 are thought to support 
the us presence as a critical defense against another attack 
supreme north korean leader kim il sung who launched the war 
still insists his forces will liberate the south 
the real obstruction to reunification is the north korean 
regime which has never changed its policy to communize south 
korea chosun ilbo a leading independent newspaper said in an 
editorial 
the korean peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii when 
us and soviet forces ended the japanese occupation the south has 
developed into one of the most properious nations in asia as the 
north has become a ruthless autocratic state with an economy in 
virtual collapse because of mismanagement 
the radicals represent a small but powerful minority on college 
campuses with the most extreme proleftist elements increasingly 
taking control of the protest movement as its support has declined 
radical students and dissidents have lost much support since 
president roh taewoos government ended almost all authoritarian 
controls and began major reforms after massive unrest last summer 
the radicals insist nothing has changed and continue to call for 
the overthrow of the government they have compensated for loss of 
numbers with greater extremism and a growing willingness to use 
violence 
radicals have attacked government and us diplomatic buildings 
with bombs and firebombs as well as fighting riot police in campus 
and street battles 
the growing extremism of the radicals is seen by some observers 
as an inevitable result of years of violent political confrontation 
in south korea authoritarian rule they say has produced 
hardcore extremists who want a revolution and are turning to the 
north as they lose support at home

this springs run of atlantic salmon 
in the connecticut river is less than onethird of last years the 
head of a joint federal and state program to restore the prize game 
fish said wednesday 
but biologists arent certain yet whether the cool spring 
weather has just slowed the fish or they died before reaching 
spawning age said stephen rideout executive director of the 
connecticut river atlantic salmon commission 
since the connecticut river tends to have the first run of the 
season along the east coast we wont have any reasonable 
assumptions until the end of the month but it appears that returns 
are also slow in the merrimack river and the rivers in maine 
rideout said normally the salmon run in the connecticut ends in 
midjuly 
so far this spring 81 returning salmon have been spotted in the 
connecticut river including 67 at the holyoke dam he said 
last year 294 fish had returned by early june he said and for 
the spring 353 salmon returned to the connecticut river 
this could be the first year since 1983 that we havent had an 
increase and thats a little dissappointing but you have to expect 
some ups and downs and as long as we can learn from what happend 
its not discouraging rideout said 
the first salmon returned to the river in the restoration 
program in 1975 before the first dams were built on the river in 
the 1700s biologists estimated that 40000 salmon migrated up the 
river annually 
rideout said commercial fishing off greenland and a disease that 
affected the fins of the young fish stocked in the lower reaches of 
the river in 1986 may have contributed to the lack of adult fish 
this spring salmon are hatched in fresh water migrate to the sea 
when they are about a year old and return to fresh water to spawn 
when they are about 3 years old 
young fish stocked in the upper tributaries of the river in 
vermont and new hampshire may also have had a high mortality rate 
because of low water when they were trying to make it downstream 
past hydropower dams to the sea in 1986 he said 
the river flow was at its lowest in 20 years in april and may 
of 1986 when they would have come downstream rideout said

first lady nancy reagan called on 
foster grandparents wednesday to work with young people who use 
drugs and desperately need help 
this will be a difficult undertaking for you because drug 
abusers may be suspicious selfish arrogant they may think they 
dont need help mrs reagan said in a speech to 500 members of 
the national foster grandparent jamboree at disney worlds epcot 
center 
she also conferred the title of honorary grandparent on mickey 
mouse who will be 60 in november 
mrs reagan who has campaigned against drug abuse and has 
supported the foster grandparent program since the late 1960s said 
merging the causes would help young drug abusers 
its a horrifying reality that virtually every child will be 
forced to make a decision on whether to use drugs by the age of 12 
or 14 she said 
they need to know that somebody still believes in them even 
though they dont believe in themselves they need to feel they are 
worth knowing and worth caring about 
after the ceremony mrs reagan was whisked over to the magic 
kingdom to help celebrate mickeys birthday at mickeys 
birthdayland the threeacre site is a new comic strip town where 
the mouses friends can visit with mickey and minnie and other 
disney characters it opens officially later this month as part of 
a yearlong celebration of mickeys 60th anniversary

government in 1965 to help lowincome people over 60 remain active 
in community service by helping underprivileged youngsters 
volunteers are paid a stipend of 44 a week for 20 hours of work 
with children at public schools daycare centers homes for the 
handicapped and similar facilities

three out of 10 teenagers say they have 
changed their sexual practices because of aids and they are as 
worried about the disease as they are about paying for college 
according to a study released wednesday 
the survey which looked at the top concerns of junior and 
senior high school students revealed that money aids and making 
the wrong decisions about the future are their biggest worries 
and while the teens were generally happy with their own lives 
they were fairly pessimistic about the world around them 
especially about social problems and the countrys future said jay 
friedland of guideline research which conducted the study for the 
american home economics association 
for example 58 percent do not think there will be an end to 
racial discrimination in the united states in their lifetimes 42 
percent think there will be nuclear war in their lifetimes and 62 
percent think their lives will be harder than those of their 
parents 
the study funded by chesebroughponds inc and lever brothers 
co surveyed 510 high school juniors and seniors nationwide 
between march 25 and april 5 quotas were established so that a 
sample of 300 teens selected at random reflected census bureau 
breakdowns of student population by sex race and ethnicity a 
supplemental group of 210 included only blacks and hispanics 
the average age of the respondents was 17 and the survey had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points 
the teenagers were asked how concerned they were about 32 
issues topics that drew responses of extremely or very 
were considered top concerns 
being able to pay for college was a top concern for 39 percent 
of the teens surveyed as was the fear of contracting aids 
thirtyfour percent listed making the wrong decisions about the 
future and not being able to change them as a top concern 
fear that the united states is steadily going down hill 
greatly concerned 33 percent and the prospects of a nationwide 
depression worried 30 percent not earning enough money to enjoy 
the better things in life was a top concern for 29 percent 
eleven percent said they know someone who has acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or who has died of it thirty percent said the 
statement i have changed my sex life because of fear of getting 
aids applied to them 
the teens were not asked to elaborate or whether in fact they 
were sexually active the survey thus did not reveal whether fear 
of aids led them to elect abstinence or to take precautions when 
having sex 
the data showed that high school juniors and seniors are keenly 
aware that drugs alcohol and sexual abuse are issues that affect 
their friends but they are less likely to admit to having such 
problems themselves 
fiftyeight percent of those surveyed have a friend who has 
thought of or committed suicide and 53 percent said some of their 
friends were ruining their lives because of drugs fortysix 
percent report alcohol abuse among their friends and 32 percent 
claim to have a friend who has been sexually abused 
but only 8 percent or less admitted that they have drug or 
alcohol problems or have thought about suicide 
despite their worries 65 percent of those surveyed said they 
believe that science will find cures for serious diseases such as 
aids and cancer in their lifetimes 
and they were optimistic about the future 78 percent expect to 
attend college and 94 percent believe having a job they enjoy will 
be an important part of their lives 
dr gail house the associations executive director said the 
survey will be used to develop courses to help teens with economic 
health emotional and other life problems the american home 
economics association represents more than 27000 home economists 
including educators dieticians and others

a coyote may lose his appetite for mutton if 
he attacks sheep protected by a new collar that wards off predators 
with sirens strobe lights and an earpiercing 
ultrahighfrequency signal the inventor says 
a patent is pending for kevin parmelys sonic spook collar a 
25pound device activated by sudden movement 
parmely who raises sheep said he initially began to develop a 
stationary warning device but realized it would be difficult to 
keep sheep near one 
i decided i needed a device that goes on the sheep and it 
took three years to finally get it small enough he said in a 
recent interview you cant have a sheep carrying around a big 
battery 
when the coyotes come into sheep the sheep jump up and it 
activates the sirens and flashing lights he said the warnings 
continue for 10 seconds and the unit resets itself in 10 minutes 
he said 
in addition to a strobe light each collar emits either an 
audible warning such as a siren or a highfrequency sound that is 
said to be painful to coyotes he said 
the collar contains an electronic eye that shuts it off in the 
daytime since about 95 percent of coyote attacks occur at night 
parmely said 
the collars are sold in sets of five which is adequate to 
protect about 200 sheep parmely said each set costs 625 he 
said the first shipment has been sold to sheep producers in south 
dakota parmely said 
the combination has been shown to keep a coyote away from sheep 
for an average of 93 days parmely said 
the state agriculture department helped parmely get started by 
purchasing 80 percent of his 29000 bank loan 
it was unique and innovative enough so we could get involved 
in it said randy englund rural development officer in the 
department englund said parmely also has obtained backing from 
private interests

the state department denied wednesday that its 
relations with greece are tense over greek reluctance to extradite 
a palestinian suspected of the terrorist bombings of two us 
airliners 
us officials have said privately that greece is stalling on an 
american request to extradite mohammed rashid who is wanted in 
connection with an explosion aboard a pan american world airways 
plane in hawaii in 1982 and a blast aboard a trans world airlines 
jet over greece in 1986 
they said rashid was arrested recently in greece on the basis of 
us intelligence information 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in general 
our bilateral relations with greece including cooperation on 
antiterrorism policy continue to be conducted normally 
she declined to comment on details of the rashid case saying 
only that its our practice to share information with our allies 
including greece on the issue of terrorism we do not discuss the 
specifics of such sharing of information 
us officials said privately that greece has told the united 
states it does not have sufficient evidence against rashid to 
warrant extraditing him and asked for additional information 
us ambassador robert keeley met with greek prime minister 
andreas papandreou in athens last thursday to discuss the case 
greek officials have refused to comment publicly on the case or to 
say whether they are holding rashid 
mrs oakley said the state departments senior counterterrorism 
official l paul bremer went to athens recently and had 
fruitful discussions on antiterrorism issues 
privately us officials say bremer took the opportunity of his 
visit to press the us demand for rashids extradition 
the flap over rashid comes at a delicate juncture in usgreek 
relations the two countries are negotiating the renewal of leases 
for four american military bases in greece that expire dec 31 
papandreou threatened last year to call off the negotiations 
when the united states accused his government of being lax toward 
terrorism 
the united states backed off its accusations in a formal letter 
to papandreou and the talks resumed 
there are no new tensions in our relationship mrs oakley 
said wednesday 
rashid is reportedly a member of the abu nidal group which is a 
palestinian splinter group based in libya 
bremer said in recent interviews that abu nidal has stepped up 
his groups terrorism activities recently sometimes as a surrogate 
for libya

police thwarted a student march and prodemocracy 
rally planned for beijings huge main square wednesday and 
dispersed a dozen students who gathered nearby to complain armed 
officers ringed the square until 11 pm 
nearly 1000 students rallied late into the night on the beijing 
university campus 10 miles away but speakers urged them to press 
their demands through proper channels no plans were made to 
try the march another day 
i wouldnt join a demonstration now isnt the time said 
one student another declared quite frankly we are afraid 
students began arriving at tiananmen square in midafternoon 
apparently traveling singly from beijing university and other 
schools but found the police were there in force 
at the national museum of chinese revolution on one side of the 
square about a dozen students from beijing university complained 
in late afternoon that their right of expression had been violated 
police quickly intervened 
officers were seen taking one person away but the students said 
he was not from their group 
city authorities had told students the 10mile march they 
planned for wednesday afternoon from beijing university to 
tiananmen the symbolic political center of china was illegal and 
would endanger the stability necessary for economic and political 
reforms 
hundreds of students at chinas most prominent university milled 
around posters calling for democracy human rights and better 
conditions for underpaid intellectuals but seemed undecided about 
what to do 
students at both the campus and tienanmen said school 
authorities had called meetings to warn students of consequences 
including arrest if they went ahead with the march 
at the 100acre square police stood at attention about 50 feet 
apart around the perimeter several dozen students in small groups 
waited nearby until early evening 
one student said i came to watch but i wont join in because 
students have no power what good is it 
police reinforcements and vehicles were posted in side streets 
around the square which is framed by the great hall of the people 
mao tsetungs mausoleum the museum of revolution and the old 
imperial palace 
tourists usually stroll through the square but were ordered out 
at 1 pm and milled around the edges waiting for something to 
happen 
posters promoting the rally had been displayed on the beijing 
university campus for several days but those put up wednesday had 
a more sober tone 
people of beijing university think three times one 
advised if beijing university moves one step all of china will 
shake 
several others also echoed official statements published by the 
government press wednesday urging students to maintain the nations 
stability and unity so china can continue the reforms of the past 
decade 
one poster said bluntly we should march but we should also 
obey the law 
a mass march would have been the first major political protest 
by students since prodemocracy demonstrations in the winter of 
198687 that led to a crackdown on western liberal ideas hu 
yaobang a noted liberal was ousted as communist party chief for 
failing to quell the disturbances quickly 
the latest unrest stems from the death june 2 of a beijing 
university student who was beaten by a gang offcampus 
about 1000 students joined an allnight march from the campus 
to tiananmen square after the death of chai qingfeng 22 police 
did not interfere with that protest which focused on demands for a 
quick resolution to the murder case and did not address sensitive 
political issues 
six nonstudents were arrested satisfying student demands for 
quick justice but the protest expanded to such complaints as poor 
living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects for 
intellectuals after graduation 
since the killing hundreds have gathered on the campus in the 
evenings for impromptu debates posters appeared on bulletin boards 
demanding democracy a free press an end to government corruption 
and greater respect and higher salaries for intellectuals 
beijing university students marched to tiananmen square in 1919 
to protest japans occupation of part of china the result was a 
nationalist fervor from which the communist party emerged in the 
1920s 
since then beijing students often have flocked to tiananmen to 
celebrate important events or voice political concerns

president najib is fighting new 
political battles at home and abroad as soviet troops withdraw from 
afghanistan and moslem guerrillas press their war against his 
government 
najibs visit to the united nations disarmament conference in 
new york this week fits neatly into his campaign to be treated as 
an international statesman and a legitimate leader rather than a 
leader of a soviet client state 
his efforts to win respectability abroad got a windfall in the 
past two weeks in the form of visits to kabul by top french and 
italian diplomats and by prince sadruddin aga khan the un 
special envoy for the repatriation of afghan refugees 
but najibs efforts to create a more broadly based government 
at least in outward appearance have bogged down 
the ussupported mujahedeen guerrillas have rejected his 
repeated calls for them to lay down their arms and accept posts in 
his government 
in his united nations debut speech tuesday najib threatened to 
seek a delay in the soviet troop withdrawal if pakistan continued 
its vigorous support of anticommunist guerrillas 
we want to visualize an optimistic situation najib said 
but should such violations acquire a permanent character in 
such a case we would certainly renew our consideration on the 
schedule of withdrawal and take proper reactions together with the 
soviet union 
on may 26 najib nominated a new prime minister mohammad hassan 
sharq sharq has never been identified as a member of the ruling 
sovietstyle peoples democratic party of afghanistan but he is a 
political survivor and a pragmatic technocrat who has worked 
closely with party officials for nearly a decade 
government officials predicted the rest of the cabinet would be 
named within 24 hours but najib left on his trip to moscow new 
york and havana while the fractious coterie of senior party members 
was still trying to forge it sharq announced his 24member cabinet 
tuesday while najib was in new york 
najibs departure before the cabinet was announced invites two 
theories 
it is evidence of supreme confidence that he is firmly in 
control of the government or at least as firmly in control as any 
leader has been in a country with a history of disregard for 
central authority 
conversely it puts him conveniently and securely out of 
the country should fellow party members decide the time has come to 
install a new leader 
najib who came to power in 1986 is the fourth afghan leader in 
the 15 years since king zahir shah was overthrown each of the 
other three was either forcibly shunted aside or assassinated at 
the instigation of the sovietstyle party 
along with his struggle to survive najib is fighting an uphill 
battle to shed the ruthless image he acquired when he headed the 
dreaded khad secret police afghanistans version of the soviet 
unions kgb 
a nonwestern observer predicted the afghan people would neither 
forgive nor forget najibs days at khad they say he personally 
signed a lot of death sentences the observer said on condition 
of anonymity 
a western diplomat who agrees with washington that najib and his 
party are doomed remarked on the divisions within the party that in 
its decade of power has seen constantly shifting alliances as 
well as expulsions and sometimes executions of politburo members 
there are guys sitting in the same room who tortured each 
other the diplomat said on condition of anonymity theres no 
party dogma that will hold this thing together 
another western diplomat dismissed washingtons optimism that 
the peoples democratic party would crumble as the soviets continue 
with their withdrawal of more than 100000 troops scheduled for 
completion by feb 15 1989 
the soviet union has a very firm strategy to withdraw and to 
stay here at the same time the diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity he cautioned against optimism that a soviet military 
withdrawal meant an end to soviet interest and influence in 
afghanistan 
najib told a news conference tuesday that more than 34000 
soviet soldiers have left afghanistan since may 15 under a 
unmediated agreement calling for a complete red army pullout 
over nine months 
the visits to afghanistan by the secretariesgeneral of the 
french and italian foreign ministries were denounced by some 
diplomats from western allies who had stood firm in not recognizing 
afghan leaders installed after the soviet military intervention in 
1979 
western nations including france italy britain and the 
united states withdrew their ambassadors in protest of the soviet 
intervention nearly a decade later their embassies in kabul still 
operate without ambassadors 
but france and italy provided the first crack in western 
solidarity 
in separate letters french president francois mitterrand and 
italian president francesco cossiga appealed to najib to pardon 
citizens of their countries who had been jailed in kabul a french 
photojournalist and an italian reporter who were convicted of 
espionage after entering afghanistan with the pakistanibased 
mujahedeen guerrillas 
the appeals succeeded the journalists were released the 
letters that brought about their freedom congratulated najib on the 
april 14 geneva agreement that brought about the soviet withdrawal 
and they granted najib a measure of the international 
respectability he is seeking

of montana 
in california voters rejected propositions authorizing an aids 
quarantine closing the rancho seco nuclear plant dividing mammoth 
san bernardino county in two and relaxing state spending limits 
imposed after taxslashing proposition 13 was passed a decade ago 
tuesdays ballots also included one race for governor and one 
for mayor in montana former democratic gov thomas judge captured 
the nomination to succeed retiring democrat ted schwinden scoring 
39 percent of the vote in a sixman race he will face republican 
former state sen stan stephens in san diego mayor maureen 
oconnor was elected to a full fouryear term with 58 percent of 
the vote 
in congressional races california rep ernest konnyu a 
freshman republican from the san jose suburb of saratoga became 
the first incumbent to lose a primary this year falling by a 58 
percentto42 percent margin to tom campbell a politically 
moderate stanford professor 
newark nj councilman donald payne won the democratic 
nomination in the 10th district with 73 percent of the vote for a 
chance to succeed retiring peter rodino and become the states 
first black in congress victory in the primary is tantamount to 
election in the overwhelmingly democratic district 
oliver north the fired white house national security aide 
indicted in the irancontra affair scored a personal success as a 
campaigner when two republicans for whom he stumped in southern 
california won congressional primaries former deputy white house 
counsel christopher cox was the victor over 12 rivals in the 40th 
district and former reagan administration speechwriter dana 
rohrabacher topped an eightcandidate field in the 42nd district 
in senate races firstterm new jersey democrat frank lautenberg 
polled 77 percent of the vote against two challengers and will 
defend his seat against pete dawkins a former star athlete rhodes 
scholar and vietnam war hero who moved from new york to new jersey 
to make his first bid for office 
the two expect to spend a total of 14 million on the race 
which the national gop has targeted as vital to its hopes of 
recapturing the senate democrats now control it 5446 
in california democratic lt gov leo mccarthy shrugged off 
three primary opponents for the right to challenge firstterm 
republican sen pete wilson 
wilson has spent 7 million already on his reelection and 
his numbers are exactly where they were 18 months ago at 50 
percent which is the definition of a very vulnerable incumbent 
said anita dunn communications director for the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee in washington 
her counterpart in the gop tom mason saw vulnerability on the 
democratic side in montana where sen john melcher won nomination 
to a third term with 76 percent of the vote against a political 
newcomer 
the good news for us is that melchers 76 percent against a 
nobody tells us a good manifestation of voter dissatisfaction 
mason said 
melcher not surprisingly took exception to that analysis 
i think the republican senatorial committee would like to 
capture this seat he said im going to make sure that doesnt 
happen 
the republican candidate county commissioner conrad burns said 
he expected melcher to attack him as inexperienced but added 
when youre green youre growing and when youre ripe youre 
rotten thats how well counter 
mason also said the victory by state sen bill valentine in new 
mexicos fourman gop senate primary put him in good shape for a 
run at firstterm democrat bingaman 
it was a clean campaign and there are no scars left so we 
can focus on bingamans lack of name id and lack of depth of 
support mason said 
valentine immediately attacked his rival as too liberal for new 
mexico saying bingaman supported big labor big government and 
big spending on the part of washington 
with 97 percent of the vote counted valentine had 33698 votes 
or 43 percent and his closest challenger former interior 
department official rick montoya had 22392 votes or 28 percent

it was an extremely interesting new speech it broke a lot of 
new ground and it is deserving of study the permanent us 
representative said 
shevardnadze also said the geneva accords for the withdrawal of 
soviet troops from afghanistan are being violated undermining 
confidence in other peace talks 
the soviet official did not identify the united states or 
pakistan as the offending parties but his implication was clear 
when one party observes its obligations under the geneva 
agreements while the other party is violating them this naturally 
causes us to have doubts about our partner and to refuse to trust 
him he said 
the united nations helped negotiate a pact signed in geneva 
which calls for the withdrawal of more than 100000 red army troops 
from afghanistan within a year and the repatriation of millions of 
afghan refugees who fled to pakistan and iran 
in his 45minute address shevardnadze called for reductions in 
conventional arms in europe including cutbacks by both sides of 
about 500000 soldiers each 
his speech included a call for a ban on space weapons a 
chemical weapons ban a un naval force and a central role for the 
united nations in verifying disarmament 
the soviet union announced a unilateral testing moratorium in 
august 1985 the united states refused to go along and the 
moratorium ended 1 years later 
the highlight of the speech appeared to be a renewal of the 
soviet offer 
our invariable position on a nuclear testing moratorium is 
still valid shevardnadze said on the basis of reciprocity 
with the united states we are ready to reintroduce and to observe 
it this time not for a year and a half but for all times 
without limiting and banning nuclear tests he said it is 
difficult or impossible to prevent the global spread of nuclear 
weapons 
the soviet foreign minister repeated his call for creation of 
un naval forces comprised of forces of the permanent members of 
the security council the soviet union the united states britain 
china and france 
on port calls shevardnadze said the soviet union was ready to 
announce the presence or absence of nuclear weapons aboard its 
naval ships calling at foreign ports 
the united states consistently has refused to make disclosures 
about port calls by nucleararmed ships

a tuberculosis outbreak at a rest home 
has infected 23 employees 19 patients and four people working at a 
nearby hospital prompting the state to consider rules to prevent a 
recurrence 
the outbreak at ruby mountains manor in elko which has been 
known to health authorities since january resulted in its 
temporary decertification although health division administrator 
larry matheis said tuesday all people involved have been treated 
and the situation now is completely under control 
matheis said the outbreak is the first serious problem involving 
tb in nevada in 25 years the first of its sort in a nursing home 
anywhere in the nation in recent years and follows a national 
resurgence of the disease 
ruby mountains headed by john watson of sparks is operating 
under a provisional license has passed one inspection and is due 
for a followup in about two weeks matheis added 
matheis said federal medicare and medicaid funds have been cut 
off although state medicaid payments are still being made to the 
facility he also said no new admissions are being allowed at this 
time there are about 70 patients at the home 
four of the cases are being treated as confirmed tb while the 
others are viewed as infections all those involved have undergone 
treatment matheis said 
a board of health hearing july 20 will deal with a proposed 
regulation requiring all nursing homes admissions to be tested for 
tb as a result of the outbreak at ruby mountains manor 
gov richard bryan had been asked to sign emergency rules but 
instead suggested matheis send a letter being mailed this week to 
all nursing homes requesting the tests and a records review to 
ensure all employees have had annual tb tests 
dr debra brus who headed a health division inspection team 
sent to ruby mountains manor said one woman still working at the 
facility is a confirmed tb sufferer and may have been the source of 
the infections but hadnt had a tb test since 1986 
probably had that test been performed this might not have 
happened said brus but she added its pure unadulterated 
baloney to suggest the state didnt react quickly enough to the 
problem 
one elderly patient at the home is infected and near death but 
brus said she was advised by the nursing homes medical director 
that old age heart trouble and other ailments rather than the tb 
infection are the main causes for the patients condition

prospects of loan repayments by the 
governments of cuba and ethiopia are doubtful but prospects of 
repayment from the soviet union are excellent president john a 
bohn jr of the governments exportimport bank told senators 
wednesday 
bohn said he expects repayment only if there is a change in the 
cuban government 
ann frey a press officer at the bank said cuba owes it more 
than 92 million in principal and interest the debt is from loans 
made before president fidel castro came to power 
ms frey said ethiopia owes more than 17 million in loans and 
guarantees and has not received any additional loans since 1984 
bohn said he sees no chance of repayment under the present system 
there 
the soviet union owes more than 142 million having already 
paid most of the money the bank lent it in 1973 and 1974 and is 
continuing repayments on schedule according to the banks figures 
these loans are carried on the banks books as assets so are 
loans made to the nationalist government on mainland china before 
the communist government drove it to taiwan in 1949 
bohn told the senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations that the bank lost 461 million in the year that ended 
last sept 30 and expects to lose 350 million in the current year 
he explained the losses as due largely to loans made at low 
interest rates in the early 1980s while the bank itself had to 
borrow at higher rates 
the bank sees its job as lending money at subsidized interest 
rates when necessary to promote sales of us industry largely 
to third world purchasers it competes with similar lenders in 
other exporting countries especially france japan britain and 
canada 
it is asking congress for authority to lend another 705 million 
in the year beginning oct 1 and to guarantee 102 billion in 
loans by commercial banks bohn submitted a table showing the bank 
expects to make money again in the year 2008 as it did until 1982 
the general accounting office which watches over spending for 
congress wants the bank to set up a reserve to cover losses as 
commercial banks do bohn declined that proposal again wednesday 
we would have to make determinations that certain countries 
are not likely to repay he said 
although we would attempt of course tokeep such information 
secret it would almost certainly become public knowledge this 
could not only impair us bilateral relations but could also send 
the wrong signal to debtor countries and in fact may encourage them 
not to repay their debts 
another witness nancy d frame is acting director of another 
smaller us government effort which promotes both trade and aid 
objectives the trade and development program of the international 
development cooperation agency 
she testified that since 1980 it has promoted more than 12 
billion worth of us exports and expects to generate another 7 
billion worth the program has had 128 million in appropriations 
over that period and is seeking another 204 million for fiscal 
1989 
by far the agencys biggest activity has been in china where it 
spent 157 million between 1981 and 1987 it spent 76 million in 
thailand 46 million in the philippines and 43 million in 
indonesia

the philippines deported an alleged terrorist to 
japan on wednesday and police questioned him about whether the 
japanese red army plans attacks at the olympic games in south 
korea a police official said 
hiroshi sensui 51 was arrested tuesday at a manila hospital 
where he was said to have undergone plastic surgery to conceal his 
identity he was deported wednesday afternoon and about 100 police 
stood guard when he arrived at tokyos narita airport 
he kept silent throughout the brief interrogation upon his 
arrival said the police official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
mirian defensorsantiago the philippine immigration 
commissioner said in manila that preliminary reports from security 
officials in the region indicated the terrorists have initiated 
activity expected to culminate in the olympic games 
she said evidence indicated the japanese red army formed in 
1968 had planned to use manila as a base for operations during the 
olympics scheduled for sept 17oct 2 in seoul south korea 
authorities in japan and manila have said sensui was the red 
armys chief representative in the philippines the japanese police 
official said sensui needs some rest and sleep and interrogation 
would resume thursday 
he would not say what charges the man would face beyond that of 
using a false passport in manila the official said when and how 
sensui went to the philippines was not clear 
mrs defensorsantiago said the suspect had lived there for 
several years under the assumed name hiroshi yamaguchi and 
initially denied being sensui officials said fingerprints 
confirmed his identity 
police say sensui was released from prison in 1977 in exchange 
for hostages aboard a japan air lines plane the japanese red army 
hijacked in dacca bangladesh 
recent arrests of several alleged members of the terrorist group 
have caused speculation that it had resumed operations after being 
dormant for several years and might be planning attacks at the 
olympics 
authorities learned that sensui was in the philippines after 
osamu maruoka alleged to be no 2 in the japanese red army was 
arrested in japan in november police said 
after maruokas arrest investigators found he had contacts in 
manila with sensui and sasaki norio an explosives expert alleged 
to be a member of the group officials said 
police said they also found maruoka had a oneway airplane 
ticket to seoul the following month 
on may 6 yasuhiro shibata an alleged red army member linked to 
the hijacking of a japan air lines plane to north korea in 1970 
was arrested in tokyo yu kikumura another suspected red army 
member was arrested in the united states in april on charges of 
possessing explosives 
italian police are seeking two more alleged red army members 
junzo okudaira and fusako shigenobu said to be the terrorist 
groups leader for suspected involvement in a car bomb attack in 
naples in april 
at its peak the japanese red army had only about 300 members 
police say and crackdowns in japan forced it to move to the middle 
east it gained notoriety with an attack at tel avivs lod airport 
in 1972 in which 28 people were killed including two of the three 
terrorists involved

president reagan promised today to do 
everything i can to help george bush win the presidency and 
added that ill be pretty handicapped if bush should lose to 
democrat michael dukakis 
reagan assessing the democrats said he had great 
disagreement with jesse jacksons policies but thought jackson 
had proven himself a viable candidate through the primary 
season 
he gave a backhanded slap at dukakis when he was asked how hed 
advise bush to deal with his underdog status in the polls 
id say george wait until you and i get out there on the 
trail and start pinning him down on the things he claims which we 
know are not true reagan said adding they would then list their 
own accomplishments 
he said of dukakis you know if i listen to him long enough 
i would be convinced that were in an economic downturn and that 
people are homeless and people are going without food and medical 
attention and that weve got to do something about the 
unemployed 
reagan said he hoped the election goes the way id like it to 
go and that bush will be the one to succeed him 
ill be pretty handicapped if it goes one way reagan said 
in an apparent reference to a possible dukakis victory he had been 
asked how he planned to deal with his successor about matters that 
he had been unable to accomplish during his term of office 
he commented during a questionandanswer session with regional 
reporters one day after dukakis clinched enough delegates for the 
democratic nomination 
reagan made several laudatory comments about his vice president 
and said at one point hes been a part of everything weve 
accomplished in this administration 
the president appeared unconcerned about recent attempts by bush 
to distance himself from the administrations policies 
in particular reagan was asked to respond to comments the vice 
president made about the soviet union that seemed at odds with 
reagans more positive assessments voiced at the moscow summit 
no hes being as careful as we all must be reagan said 
asked about jacksons candidacy reagan said theres no 
question that he has impressed a great number of followers 
and i want to say without any inference to any racial 
difference or anything i would have to say i find myself in great 
disagreement with policies that he has proposed as well as those of 
the other candidate dukakis reagan said 
he added that such disagreement goes with the game and that 
they obviously have different goals in mind than we have

the judge in the irancontra case ruled today 
that oliver l north john m poindexter and two other defendants 
each be tried separately so they can defend themselves using each 
others congressional testimony given under a grant of limited 
immunity 
us district judge gerhard a gesell asked independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh to decide whether he wants to try north or 
poindexter in the first of four trials 
the other two defendants richard v secord and albert hakim 
would be tried later 
gesell also said the trials should be held in washington 
rejecting a defense argument that the pretrial publicity has 
damaged the defendants right to a fair trial 
the defendants had urged a separate trial on grounds that the 
immunized testimony included information that would prove their 
innocence for instance secord has said that testimony by north 
would show that money from us arms sales to iran belonged to 
secords business enterprise rather than the us government as the 
indictment charged 
while norths testimony could not be used in his own trial it 
could be used in secords and viceversa 
gesell said that any defendant should have considerable leeway 
to use indirectlyand possibly directly immunized testimony while 
defending the charges against him 
he said the right to a fair trial cannot be preserved if any 
two defendants are tried together 
walsh is barred from using the defendants immunized 
congressional testimony as evidence against them even though the 
defendants can use it themselves 
outside the courthouse walsh declined to comment on the judges 
decision except to say that everyone realizes that four trials 
are more burdensome than one but the judge feels that thats a 
necessary requirement to protect the constitutional rights of all 
four defendants 
walsh declined to say whether north of poindexter would be tried 
first gesell gave the prosecutor until friday to make his decision 
gesell said defendants at criminal trials are afforded the 
powerful weapon of crossexamination an essential part of our 
adversarial system 
crossexamination is an effective means of ensuring the truth 
will prevail before a jury its a precious constitutional right 
the judge said 
each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimony 
revealed information which one or more of the defendants considers 
helpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect of the 
case gesell said 
each defendant has contemplated using immunized testimony of 
other witnesses gesell said 
the judge said congress had a legitimate interest in conducting 
the hearings but he noted that questioning of north poindexter and 
hakim was in a highly accusatory context spiked with accusation 
of criminal impropriety 
in arguments before the decision michael r bromwich a lawyer 
for walsh said that publicity while extensive has often favored 
the defendants 
he said colonel north is on the lecture circuit and receives 
20000 a lecture he certainly doesnt carry a stigma that would 
be prejudicial in this case 
any evidence of pretrial prejudice he said should be tested 
against real people who step into the jury box 
and he added we dont think any political considerations 
ought to enter into fixing a trial date 
richard w beckler poindexters attorney argued that the 
irancontra affair will play a major role in the presidential 
campaign especially as questions are raised about vice president 
george bushs role 
it would be a travesty to have this case proceed under that 
glare and spotlight he said 
north poindexter secord and hakim are charged in a 23count 
indictment with conspiring to illegally divert profits from sale of 
arms to iran to the nicaraguan contra rebels other counts involve 
obstruction of presidential and congressional investigations of the 
irancontra affair and theft of us government property 
beckler said the irancontra case unlike the watergate scandal 
saw the public exposed to massive amounts of information from 
congress and the reagan administration that would not be admissible 
at trial 
and he said the congressional hearings on watgergate were held 
when it was not certain there would be criminal prosecutions 
in the irancontra case beckler said the independent counsel 
already was preparing his case as congress was receiving testimony 
under grants of limited immunity against prosecution information 
that will not be used at trial 
gesell assured beckler if these men are convicted theyre 
not going to be convicted by pretrial publicity that can be 
assured

the rev c kenneth hall was elected today to 
lead the nations largest presbyterian denomination through its 
bicentennial year 
hall a 63yearold minister from butler pa was selected over 
four other candidates on the first ballot by the 630 commissioners 
or delegates to the 200th general assembly of the presbyterian 
church usa 
hall will be chief spokesman for the 3 millionmember 
denomination for the following year 
hall received 319 votes other candidates were the revs 
juventino r ballesteros 54 of savannah ga 133 votes james r 
struthers 66 of stillwater okla 30 roy h zuefeldt 63 of 
abilene texas 79 and james spalding 66 professor of religion 
at the university of iowa 64 
after todays election the commissioners moved into committee 
meetings to discuss various issues incluing a report saying 
pornography debases gods gifts and is far from the mutual sexual 
delight depicted biblically 
pornography far from the song of songs recommends among 
other things that members of the church boycott materials and 
companies that market or produce pornographic materials 
the pornography reports title refers to the song of 
solomon an old testament book that contains some of the most 
sexually explict language in the bible 
some critics however say the paper does not go far enough in 
condemning pornography 
sharlyn stare who heads a special presbyterian committee on 
pornography in cincinnati said the recommendations need to be 
more aggressive to moving people to support prosecution of illegal 
obscenity and child pornography 
other reports include a paper entitled christian obedience in 
a nuclear age which declares that nuclear war and the theory of 
nuclear deterrence are immoral and calls on presbyterians to be 
more active in the fight for peace 
while the paper stops short of calling for a denominational 
position of civil disobedience it calls for the support of those 
who feel compelled to engage in resistance and recommends 
establishing a fund to support resisters 
antiabortion groups within the church are also hoping to 
persuade the commissioners to toughen the churchs stance against 
abortion 
the reports will be considered by the commissioners at committee 
meetings on thursday and friday the commissions reassemble 
saturday to deal with the reports 
the meeting runs through next wednesday 
as part of the antiabortion effort presbyterians prolife 
sponsored a visit here tuesday by mother teresa of calcutta who 
called abortion the greatest destroyer of love and peace 
if i had power i would open a jail and put every single 
doctor in jail for killing life killing a child a gift of god 
said the nobel peace prize winner who is noted for her work with 
the poor 
every single child every unborn child in the womb is 
precious to him is created for greater things to love and be 
loved she said in a speech to about 600 people including 
commissioners and st louis roman catholic archbishop john l may 
the presbyterian church usa has condemned abortion as a 
method of birth control but said the decision rests with the 
woman her physician and god 
presbyterians prolife wants the church to condemn abortion in 
all instances except where the mothers life is in danger 
the denomination was formed by the 1983 merger of the united 
presbyterian church in the united states of america which was the 
principal denomination in the north and the presbyterian church in 
the united states which was the principal southern body the 
merger healed a split over slavery stemming from the civil war

committee of airplane bills of sale that never were sent to the 
federal aviation administration of fictitious names and addresses 
reported for buyers and sellers and of signatures scrawled 
illegibly on faa forms and modifications such as installation of 
longrange fuel tanks that went unreported to the government 
the faa did not pursue such gaps in documentation and in some 
cases required no records that would make it easier to track down 
aircraft owners and pilots the witness said 
i didnt see a vast amount of brilliance in the smuggling 
community said the man who was referred to by the legislators 
as mr smith if you give them an opportunity to make 
mistakes and leave a paper trail it seems to me theyll make 
mistakes and leave a paper trail 
rep glenn anderson dcalif chairman of the committee said 
64 percent of the cocaine and marijuana seized in the united states 
last year was captured on small planes owned by individuals or 
businesses he cited a report by the office of technology 
assessment a research arm of congress that estimated that there 
are 1300 to 3500 drugsmuggling flights by small planes entering 
the country annually 
in what has been the usual procedure in the spate of drug 
hearings held by congress during this election year the witness 
was accompanied by several armed capitol police officers who stood 
guard inside and outside the hearing room 
the man said he was a former member of the federal witness 
protection program and was on probation after pleading guilty to 
state charges of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and racketeering 
he said he had worked for a loose confederation of 
americans colombians bahamians and others who smuggled cocaine 
into the united states aboard aircraft he was responsible for the 
registration and ownership documents of more than 40 planes used by 
the participants some used for legitimate businesses they owned 
and others for smuggling 
to disguise the planes ownership the witness said he often had 
foreigners sign registration forms and use difficult to trace 
american mailing addresses he would at times use addresses of 
apartment complexes without supplying apartment numbers and 
arrange to have people who lived at the complexes watch for piles 
of undelivered mail and relay it 
the witness also said mechanics who modified the planes he used 
often knew why the equipment was being installed on the aircraft 
as a result they had no interest in making any documentation 
of the work which they would have had to sign for fear of 
jeopardizing their licenses he said 
at the same hearing four drug investigators complained that 
they were frequently hindered by federal regulations that made it 
possible for smugglers to hide their identities 
aircraft identification and registered owner identification is 
an elusive veil behind which the smuggler finds refuge said 
carol knapik an undercover detective in the broward county fla 
sheriffs office she also testified from behind screens 
janet hale an assistant secretary of the department of 
transportation told the lawmakers that the faa was trying to 
improve its registration systems so it could provide more 
information to law enforcement agencies 
the public works committee is considering legislation that would 
require the faa to improve its recordkeeping system

california voters said no to quarantining 
aids sufferers kept the rancho seco nuclear plant alive and 
refused to form their first new county in 80 years while sending 
mixed signals on taxes and growth in the most populous state 
with all but a handful of tuesdays votes counted voters 
rejected propositions 71 and 72 both aimed at relaxing state 
spending limits 
proposition 71 which would have allowed government to spend 
more money was defeated 49 percent to 51 percent proposition 72 
designed to modify the limit to allow the gasoline sales tax to be 
spent on highway construction was turned down 38 percent to 68 
percent 
the ceiling approved in 1979 after voters slashed taxes with 
proposition 13 ties annual expenditures to population growth and 
the cost of living 
proposition 69 the aids measure backed by extremist lyndon 
larouche was defeated by a 68 percent to 32 percent margin it 
called for adding aids to the state list of communicable diseases 
giving officials the right to quarantine patients and those testing 
positive for the virus a similar proposal was rejected at the 
polls 18 months ago 
san bernardino county voters opposed by a twothirds majority 
the creation of an 18160squaremile mojave county the county 
would have been the states largest claiming 90 percent of the 
land in san bernardino county but just 20 percent of its residents 
the rancho seco plant won a reprieve from the wrecking ball 
voters in sacramento county and part of placer county narrowly 
approved a measure backed by a 14 million campaign by the 
nuclear energy industry to give plant managers 18 months to iron 
out problems that have caused more than 100 outages since it opened 
in 1974 the vote was 516 percent in favor and 484 percent 
opposed 
an opposing measure which would have turned off the reactor for 
good lost by an even narrower margin 496 percent in favor to 
504 percent opposed 
voters also approved two measures to control on campaign 
spending 
proposition 68 aimed at limiting contributions to legislative 
candidates was approved 53 percent to 47 percent proposition 73 
which limits contributions in all state and local races and 
prohibits public campaign financing won the support of 58 percent 
of the voters 
under state law since proposition 73 won by a greater margin 
than 68 its provisions will supersede proposition 68 in areas 
where the two conflict 
voters statewide showed they were ready to spend money for some 
projects they said yes to an 800 million school bond issue 65 
percent to 35 percent approved a bond issue to fund housing loans 
for veterans 68 percent to 32 percent okd a 150 million bond 
issue to fund reinforcement of masonry apartment buildings which 
could tumble in an earthquake and also backed a 776 million bond 
issue for purchase and development of parks and land supporting 
endangered species 65 percent to 35 percent 
proposition 74 a 1 billion bond issue to build and improve 
state highways was too close to call with yes and no 
votes separated by about 10000 out of more than 5 million cast 
the outcome might not be known until july 5 when the official vote 
count is released 
measures aimed at slowing growth met mixed receptions orange 
countys measure a the most sweeping was opposed by 557 percent 
of voters and favored by 443 percent the initiative aimed to 
limit growth depending on the impact it would have on roads 
emergency services flood control and parks 
growthrelated measures passed in the southern california 
communities of irvine hemet san clemente and san marcos but 
measures in the los angeles suburbs of manhattan beach and pasadena 
were defeated easily 
voters in san francisco split on two measures aimed at reducing 
the citys expected 179 million deficit they passed proposition 
b calling for a oneyear freeze on wage hikes for city employees 
with 78 percent in favor and just 22 percent opposed but they 
turned down proposition k which would have lifted the 
stateimposed limit on spending defeating it by 56 percent to 44 
percent 
mayor art agnos said wednesday that he would have to lay off 356 
employees close three fire stations and cut health srvices 
taking advantage of a state law passed last year allowing all 
counties to raise the sales tax for transportation and permitting

airborne computers will send more easily 
understood data back from inside hurricanes this year helping 
groundbased meteorologists better track and predict the giant 
storms 
in the past the weather information radioed back from research 
aircraft has had to undergo analysis on the ground before it could 
be used in storm reports and studies now some of that work will 
be done aboard the airplane itself 
the real benefit involved in doing this is that the forecaster 
on the ground will be seeing things in the data almost as quickly 
as the observer on the airplane explained dr stanley rosenthal 
director of the hurricane research division of the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration in key biscayne fla 
over the years its become apparent that people on the 
research plane are able see things important things that 
forecasters on the ground ought to be able to see he said in a 
telephone interview wednesday 
this has not been possible before but now we are able to 
provide the man on the ground with information almost as quickly as 
on those on the aircraft he said 
while information such as the wind speed and direction 
temperature and rainfall may seem simple instruments collecting 
this data dont necessarily provide it in simple numerical form 
rosenthal said 
past practice has been for the various electronic readings to be 
radioed back to the ground where they were converted to numerical 
readings and then combined for use in research and forecasting 
the new system tried experimentally last year uses a new 
computer on the noaa p3 orion aircraft to quickly convert the 
instrument readings to usable data and combine the numbers in 
various ways to make them mose useful to forecasters on the ground 
that means that as the plane flies through the storm its will be 
sending back a steady stream of data on the state of the hurricane 
itself its direction of movement and any changes according to dr 
hugh willoughby also of the hurricane research division 
the information is sent from the aircraft to satellites and then 
returns to the ground at the noaa satellite station at wallops 
island va from there is is transmitted both to the researchers in 
key biscayne and to forecasters at the national hurricane center in 
nearby coral gables 
much of the information will continue to be sent in the 
traditional manner rosenthal said 
but the new system will be used in addition for factors which 
tend to influence the development and movement of the storms 
among the most important of these is the exact location of the 
hurricanee eye which it is vital to know in order to predict the 
movement of the storm willoughby said an error of as little as 30 
miles in locating the eye the relatively calm center of the storm 
can make a vast difference in determining what coastal under is 
under threat and how soon landfall is likely

military police in uganda killed 200 
soldiers and detained 700 after an april mutiny at two barracks and 
an attempt to assassinate president yoweri museveni ugandan 
military sources said wednesday 
military headquarters in kampala had ordered local journalists 
not to report the mutiny and several people had been detained in 
the capital for discussing it publicly said officers in the 
ugandan army who spoke on condition of anonymity 
at least 200 mutineers of the 19th artillery regiment and the 
8th infantry battalion were slain in clashes with 3000 loyal 
troops april 78 before rebel units surrendered the sources said 
the two units are based near the ugandan capital of kampala 
about 700 mutineers were captured and detained by military 
police at luzira prison in kampala they said 
on april 11 the presidential convoy was ambushed on the 22mile 
highway from kampala to the state house in entebbe mutineers 
killed at least 16 military escorts when they fired on two of three 
military trucks the sources said 
but museveni was not traveling in his official bulletproof car 
he had flown by helicopter from kampala to the state house and 
evidently had sent the sevenvehicle convoy along the road without 
him the sources said 
the attackers escaped 
the sources said they belong to a group of dissident officers 
wanting museveni to hold peace talks with several rebel armies 
improve conditions for soldiers and expel 100 libyan and 250 north 
korean military instructors from the former british colony in east 
africa 
they said the mutiny and ambush were aimed at toppling museveni 
the military command in kampala contacted by telephone from 
nairobi would not confirm or deny the reports 
telephones at state house alternately went unanswered or were 
busy 
there have been no previous reported attempts to assassinte 
museveni who seized power jan 27 1986 ending a fiveyear bush 
war against civilian president milton obote and the military junta 
that ousted obote in july 1985 
the sources said the captives had not been illtreated and would 
be sent to reeducation camps at entebbe kyankwanzi west of 
kampala and mobuku near the zaire border the government set up the 
camps to screen surrendering rebels before they are absorbed into 
the army or allowed to return to civilian life 
soldiers loyal to obote and other toppled ugandan leaders 
including military dictator idi amin have mounted insurgencies 
since august 1986 and musevenis national resistance army has been 
battling several rebel groups 
on saturday museveni signed a peace agreement with the 
commander of the largest rebel group lt col john angelo okello 
of the northernbased uganda peoples democratic army but eric 
otema allimadi the rebels leader in exile in london rejected the 
accord in advance 
museveni envoys are trying to negotiate a similar agreement with 
a smaller rebel group fighting in the east the uganda peoples 
army

us authorities on wednesday 
displayed for the first time some of the 859 us mediumrange 
nuclear missiles to be destroyed under the superpower arms accord 
put into effect at the moscow summit 
reporters including some from the soviet union and other east 
bloc nations viewed missiles or missilefiring equipment at four 
of the 12 sites in western europe covered by the missile agreement 
soviet officials are due to begin inspecting the missile bases 
plus 14 sites in the united states as early as july 1 us 
inspectors have a reciprocal right to check 133 sites including 
126 in the soviet union six in east germany and one in 
czechoslovakia 
on june 3 the soviets invited 43 western journalists to the 
sarny military base in the northern republic of ukraine to show how 
their ss20 missile transports and launchers will be eliminated 
under the same treaty 
the inspections are a first step toward the destruction by 
1991 of all us and soviet groundlaunched intermediaterange 
nuclear forces as called for in the inf treaty that took effect 
june 1 
lothar ruehl a state secretary in the west german defense 
ministry told a media tour of a missile site near the west german 
town of schwaebisch gmuend that the first of 132 pershing 2 
missiles deployed in his country would be dismantled in september 
the 132 pershing 2s include 24 spares us officials said 
west germany and britain received the first batch of us 
missiles in november 1983 amid widespread public protests in europe 
later cruise missiles were deployed in italy and belgium the 
netherlands had been designated to take 48 missiles this year but 
that was canceled by the signing of the inf treaty in december 
using unarmed pershing 2 rockets us soldiers at the base in 
germany demonstrated how the missiles will be taken apart and 
crated before being shipped to the united states for final 
destruction 
the destructive power of the 50kiloton warheads carried by the 
pershing 2 missiles is equivalent to 50000 tons of tnt or 2 
times the explosive power of the bomb that destroyed hiroshima 
the us cruise missiles carry 200kiloton warheads 
reporters at the cruise missile bases in belgium and britain 
were not allowed to see any missiles they were shown an example of 
the metal canisters in which the rockets are stored as well as the 
launchers and the portable trailers from which a launching would be 
triggered 
reporters in belgium also were taken to the european repair 
facility near the city of charleroi where the sleek graycolored 
cruise missiles are repaired several unarmed missiles were shown 
to reporters 
at the 485th us tactical missile wing near florennes belgium 
us officials gave reporters a sample of the briefing that soviet 
inspection teams are to receive before they tour the base 
including diagrams of the protected bunker where 16 cruise missiles 
are kept 
under terms of the inf treaty soviet and us officials can 
arrive for inspections of each others bases with as little as 16 
hours advance notice 
the first round of inspections to be held between july 1 and 
aug 31 will be baseline checks to verify that missiles and 
other items covered by the treaty are in order before dismantling 
begins 
at greenham common in britain where 101 cruise missiles are 
based us officials showed reporters their preparations for the 
first inspections 
im ready for the soviets to come now said col william e 
jones the base commander 
us soldiers in camouflaged eightwheel trucks drove the 
55foot long missile launchers minus the missiles along muddy 
lanes on greenham common which is about 50 miles west of london 
once they arrive at florennes the soviet inspectors will be put 
up in a brownbrick twostory domitory near the center of the 
base they also will be given meals and office space on the base 
officials said 
col calvin chasteen commander of the us base at florennes 
declined to say when the cruise missiles would be dismantled or how 
the base would be used after the missiles were gone the base was 
opened in 1984 and much of it is still under construction 
chasteen said many of the 1300 us soldiers at the base 
would be reassigned to the united states he did not say how many 
others would be transferred to us air force facilities elsewhere 
in europe 
guy coeme the belgian defense miniter told reporters he hoped 
the missiles which arrived at florenne in march 1985 could be 
dismantled and removed by december or january he would not be more 
specific

commodity traders cast a wary eye skyward lawnsprinkling 
patrols cruised chicagos suburbs and an atlantaarea fire chief 
worried about dry hydrants as a cropsearing drought tightened its 
grip wednesday on the midwest and portions of the southeast 
worse yet the national weather service said relief would be 
both temporary and spotty at least until next week 
the rainfall shortage translated into nothing more serious than 
a call for conservation measures in many communities but some 
farmers already face worse 
lawns turn brown but they dont die al bergquist who owns 
farmland near elburn ill said after hearing complaints about 
lawnwatering restrictions on a radio callin show but thats 
what farmers face and shes worried about her yard 
a thunderstorm dumped nearly 2 inches of rain on much of iowa 
overnight but that band of showers isnt packing enough punch 
for most of the other states it will reach said meteorologist 
alan morrison of the weather services chicago office 
and the service is calling for a return to warm dry conditions 
for most of the affected areas by the weekend 
weve had a low pressure system that for some reason has 
hovered over the northeast for most of the spring said morrison 
that has meant cool wet weather there and unseasonably dry 
weather almost everywhere else 
more than six weeks of lowerthannormal rainfall recorded 
across much of the nations corn and soybeangrowing regions in 
the midwest have pushed the futures prices of those commodities to 
fouryear highs 
traders in turn have become so edgy that the single band of 
thundershowers that visited iowa late tuesday was enough to cause 
wednesday morning prices to open sharply lower 
at these price levels said richard loewy a new yorkbased 
analyst with prudentialbache securities inc everyones going 
to be extremely nervous 
if it doesnt rain soon farmers in southern indiana may face 
the worst spring drought in 25 years said jack washburn harrison 
county extension agent 
an additional 60 counties in indiana were declared federal 
disaster areas wednesday because of drought conditions 24 were so 
declared earlier this week leaving only eight of the states 92 
counties off the disaster list 
the federal governments decision to place counties on the list 
illinois wisconsin and iowa each now have more than three dozen 
counties under the declaration permits haying or grazing on land 
normally set aside as part of a cropreduction plan 
minnesota gov rudy perpich asked the federal government tuesday 
to release nearly 2 million acres the states farmers have enrolled 
in a conservation program 
in kentucky state water officials said the drought is rated 
severe in the horsebreeding country around lexington and moderate 
or mild elsewhere 
georgia gov joe frank harris told a news conference wednesday 
that several years of belownormal rainfall will require careful 
resource management for several years to come 
that situation was dramatized in several subdivisions north of 
atlanta where hydrants ran dry monday night prompting fulton 
county fire chief james gibson to say there would have been serious 
problems had a major fire broken out 
restrictions on watering lawns have been imposed in northern 
fulton county in roswell north of atlanta and in carrollton near 
the alabama border 
the same stopgap measures have been used in chicagos suburbs 
in recent weeks with moderate success 
violation of the regulations in affluent generally green 
naperville west of chicago for instance can bring fines ranging 
from 25 for a first offense to 500 for a third but at least 
1200 have been reported in the last four weeks

cuauhtemoc cardenas has charisma draws 
crowds and has two of the most famous names in mexican history 
he has just about everything a presidential candidate could want 
except a realistic chance of winning 
nevertheless cardenas is galvanizing the normally moribund and 
cynical world of mexican politics with his maverick candidacy he 
has opened fissures and fractures in the base upon which the 
governing institutional revolutionary party has rested comfortably 
for generations 
cardenas 54 is matched against the balding 40yearold 
technocrat carlos salinas de gortari who is the handpicked 
candidate of the governing partys inner circle 
that party known as the pri hasnt lost a presidential 
gubernatorial or senatorial contest since its inception in 1929 and 
is not expected to so do on july 6 
the race is about the national mood following a steady erosion 
of pri loyalty and in a time of economic crisis that has lasted 
throughout president miguel de la madrids sixyear term 
the pressure from cardenas on the left coupled with that from 
national action party candidate manuel clouthier on the right may 
force genuine change on the pri many analysts and commentators say 
cardenas is a political handlers dream he has experience good 
looks the ability to stir crowds without stooping to demagogy and 
the ability to weather scathing attacks from the progovernment 
media and both of his names are heavy with symbolism 
his father was lazaro cardenas the beloved reformist president 
for the pri who carried out sweeping land reform and nationalized 
mexicos oil in 1938 ushering in what is called the golden age 
of modernization cuauhtemoc was mexicos last aztec emperor 
cardenas has been extraordinarily successful at tapping a rich 
vein of dissatisfaction with the status quo 
he draws large crowds even in comparison to the carefully 
organized pri rallies rapt audiences listen to speeches that 
sometimes resemble an almost scholarly discourse then break out 
in cheers and applause 
the people are with you they chanted at a recent rally 
the cardenas message is populist and nationalistic pri he 
says has abandoned the 19101921 mexican revolutions goals of 
social justice and economic equality instead he charges it 
caters to foreign interests and the prosperous mexican elite that 
collaborates with them 
cardenas a pri senator for many years and former governor of 
the central state of michoacan broke away from the governing party 
last year after it rebuffed his demands for primary elections and 
other reforms 
his campaign under the banner of a coalition called the national 
democratic front steadily gained momentum it finally swept the 
left or at least most of it into a unified front long an 
elusive goal in mexican politics 
i can see that the people of mexico desire change but not as 
profound as radical as we are offering in the mexican socialist 
party said heberto castillo after abandoning his own socialist 
candidacy this week in favor of cardenas because of this they 
have turned to cardenas 
during the campaign cardenas has softened his position on 
several key issues including mexicos 100 billion foreign debt 
a new platform calls for suspending payments under the current 
terms instead of a total moratorium it also calls for reforms in 
the judicial system 
the momentum of cardenas campaign reportedly has prompted 
debate inside the pri about how large a victory it can afford 
without dangerously alienating a large portion of the electorate 
and embarrassing itself worldwide 
salinas de gortari is said to be pushing for a modest margin of 
victory while oldline pri politicos want the usual landslide 
cardenas has said the people will recognize the true winner 
they will not acknowledge someone who tries to claim victory 
through fraud

house speaker jim wright said wednesday he has 
asked the ethics committee to invite him to testify so he can 
refute charges that he violated conflict of interest rules 
i believe i can put all the allegations to rest said 
wright dtexas if the committee will give priority into looking 
at each and every charge it will discover i have violated no 
rule and certainly violated no commonly accepted ethical standard 
i would like for it to be done at the earliest possible 
time he said 
wright who has been named chairman of the democratic national 
convention next month in atlanta has called the charges a 
republican attempt to embarrass him and the party however the 
speaker said wednesday he has not heard concerns from other 
democrats that the effort could succeed 
the ethics committee began last week to examine charges against 
wright filed by political enemy newt gingrich rga common cause 
a nonprofit group which monitors government ethics also called 
for a probe of wrights actions 
the panel still deciding whether to launch a formal inquiry 
planned to meet again on thursday wright was not expected to 
testify this week his office said 
gingrichs complaint said wright violated house rules when he 
lobbied on behalf of oil companies in cases in which he had a 
financial stake and in his accepting an unusually large royalty 
contract from a friend and campaign contractor who published his 
book 
it was reported this week that wrights book was written with 
considerable help from one of his capitol hill employees including 
a taxpayerfinanced trip to texas for the project 
a top aide to wright speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said wednesday that the speakers current book project was also 
being done with the help of a congressional employee but he 
justified it as commonplace on capitol hill 
we wouldnt have given a solitary thought to anything like 
this before this big flap came up he said 
gingrich said tuesday that he too had used a staff member to 
work on one of his books 
george mair a 65000ayear press assistant is collaborating 
with wright on a book about the speakers of the house through 
congress first 200 years 
in an interview earlier this week mair insisted he was working 
on the book only outside of regular working hours but the source 
conceded that work on the book was part of mairs official duties 
one of the things thats envisioned for him to be doing is to 
be working on the book about the speakership he said 
the speaker is seeking a publisher for the book and four or 
five have expressed an interest mair said 
members of congress frequently have their staffs write speeches 
for which the member pockets honoraria he said questioning where 
the line should be drawn

mayor art agnos said wednesday that voters 
refusal to help fend off a projected 180 million budget deficit by 
raising the spending limit will force him to lay off 356 employees 
close three fire stations and cut health services 
i am concerned about it im not frightened by it he said 
of the prospective cuts in public safety and health what people 
are saying is we will accept that risk because we dont want to 
pay for it 
proposition k an override of the stateimposed spending limit 
that would have allowed the city to raise and spend 30 million in 
additional business hotel and parking taxes went down to defeat 
in tuesdays election by a 56 percent to 44 percent margin 
it would have allowed agnos to raise the hotel tax from 11 
percent to 12 percent increase the business payroll tax from 15 
percent to 16 percent and levy an annual 200 business 
registration fee for small businesses 
agnos who took office early this year had warned that without 
the taxes which were fiercely opposed by the business community 
he would be forced to lay off police officers and firefighters 
shut down fire stations and reduce health services 
a special task force of business labor and union leaders will 
meet within the next week to review his recommendations which will 
be discussed in budget hearings by the board of supervisors 
layoff notices meanwhile are scheduled to be mailed out this 
week and union officials have threatened lawsuits or ballot 
initiatives seeking minimum staffing levels that would prevent some 
dismissals 
voters apparently bought the antiproposition k campaign pitch 
that raising the spending limit to an unspecified level would 
amount to giving the board of supervisors a blank check agnos 
said 
san franciscans did approve another ballot measure calling for a 
wage freeze for police and firefighters to save 10 million and a 
voluntary early retirement plan they also passed a bond measure to 
spend 90 million to improve school facilities 
supervisor bill maher a leading opponent of proposition k 
predicted that agnos forecast of cutbacks wont materialize 
instead he said overtime expenses can be reduced and other 
portions of the budget that dont affect human services can be 
further tightened 
the message is real clear cut the spending and cut the 
government payroll he said 
san francisco has more police officers than any county in 
california with 267 per 10000 population

michael dukakis collected endorsements from several vanquished 
primary rivals on wednesday as he savored victory in the democratic 
presidential race jesse jackson said his candidacy would remain 
alive even as he solicited an invitation to join the ticket as 
vice presidential candidate 
george bush selfdescribed underdog heading into the fall 
campaign received words of encouragement from president reagan 
the president also threw a jab in dukakis direction saying you 
know if i listen to him long enough i would be convinced that 
were in an economic downturn and that people are homeless and 
people are going without food and medical attention and that weve 
got to do something about the unemployed 
with the primary season concluded dukakis was installed as a 
preelection favorite by ladbrokes one of londons leading 
bookmakers 
but senate republican leader bob dole predicted the public 
opinion polls would soon start moving in bushs direction 
dukakis who tucked away a delegate nominating majority on 
tuesday in the final four primaries of the year announced in los 
angeles he was ready to begin looking for a vice presidential 
running mate he praised jackson but said neither he nor anyone 
else is due an offer to join the ticket 
that didnt sound like what jackson wanted to hear he said his 
constituents had earned the option of having him considered 
consideration means an offer it does not mean just in passing 
he said 
he later added that for some people maybe the vice presidency 
may be a step down he added you understand my background the 
vice presidency is not the top but it is a long where from where i 
started 
the contrast between jackson on the one hand and former dukakis 
rivals sen paul simon rep richard gephardt and bruce babbitt on 
the other couldnt have been plainer 
simon of illinois called a news conference in washington to 
declare that the verdict is in and he would do everything i 
can to help elect the man from massachusetts 
former arizona gov babbitt offered his backing in a televised 
interview in california its time to come together he said 
hes a good man and ill endorse him 
gephardt arranged to bestow his blessing publicly when dukakis 
chartered campaign jet touched down in st louis for a refueling 
stop en route to boston 
new york gov mario cuomo offered an endorsement as well in 
one of the great anticlimaxes of the campaign cuomo once was the 
subject of almost daily rumors that he would make a belated entry 
into the campaign and for months his endorsement was coveted by 
all the active candidates 
i endorse him i endorse him i endorse him cuomo told 
persistent reporters 
but jackson sent alternately complimentary and confrontational 
signals to dukakis he said whatever differences exist between them 
can be resolved adding both of us are rational both of us 
are intelligent both of us want to win 
at the same time he said his campaign would remain alive 
until the democratic national convention in atlanta next month he 
said he would continue to seek delegates and dispatched top aides 
to mackinac island mich for a democratic party platform committee 
drafting session 
as for the vice presidential nomination the man who finished 
second in dozens of primaries and caucuses tried to make it sound 
like he had earned it 
asked if he would accept the spot if it were offered a 
possibility that some dukakis aides dismiss as wildly improbable 
jackson said thats a decision i must make at that time ive 
not made the decision yet whether ill accept it or not 
in an interview with abc he said consideration does mean an 
offer it does not mean just in passing we have earned 
consideration 
dukakis seemed to stiffen in response 
he agreed that jackson had earned consideration but said i 
dont think anyone is due an offer 
but there are a great many people that are going to be 
considered and hell be one of them and im not going to rule 
anybody in or out at this point he said in a taped interview 
with abc 
reagan was asked by reporters at the white house what sort of 
advice he would give to bush in his race with dukakis 
id say george wait until you and i get out there on the 
trail and start pinning him down on the things he claims which we 
know are not true he replied 
senate republican leader dole combined a prediction of a 
turnaround in the polls with an attack on dukakis 
the dukakis record stands alone and the american people dont 
like what they see its the same outoftouch liberal agenda that 
america buried in the 1980 and 1984 landslides he said 
reflecting a view held by many republican strategists dole 
added that dukakis has benefited in recent weeks from being 
perceived as a moderate in contrast to jackson 
but that wont sell anymore he said watch the polls 
will start moving in bushs direction

michael dukakis and george bush are starting 
to get serious about choosing running mates with dukakis facing an 
increasingly insistent jesse jackson who says he has earned 
consideration for the job and consideration means an offer 
dukakis quickly rejected that notion on wednesday 
i dont think anyone is due an offer but there are a great 
many people that are going to be considered and hell be one of 
them the massachusetts governor said 
dukakis locked up the democratic presidential nomination in 
tuesdays final primaries setting up his fall matchup with bush 
who has had the gop nomination in hand since late april 
clinching the nomination freed dukakis to finally admit he is 
thinking about a running mate while bush has been holding private 
talks on the matter for several weeks for both picking a vice 
presidential nominee is the next step in building what they hope 
will be an electoral college majority in november 
the vice president trailing in the polls has made it clear he 
will be happy to let dukakis go first an option granted him by the 
calendar 
dukakis must make his choice in time for it to be ratified by 
the democratic national convention in atlanta in july the no 2 
spot on the gop ticket does not have to be filled until almost a 
month later when the republicans gather in new orleans 
in the past week jackson has marched firmly to the front of the 
line of democratic politicians asking for consideration for a spot 
on the ticket on wednesday he went further contending that his 
secondplace finish in the democratic race means he deserves to 
actually be offered the no 2 spot 
consideration does mean an offer it does not mean just in 
passing jackson said 
jackson adviser ann lewis put it this way it is essential 
that any short list begin with jackson and it is essential that 
the decision be made with him not just communicated to him after 
it is made 
dukakis didnt agree that jackson must be given an offer 
i think hes due consideration and there are other people who 
deserve consideration as well dukakis said he himself has 
said that its up to the nominee to pick his running mate and i 
agree with him 
there is substantial resistance in the party to jackson 
jesse on the ticket would destroy it said veteran new york 
activist and labor lawyer charles torche there are still a lot 
of black haters out there 
dukakis is getting a lot of advice to pick a southerner to help 
him in that region or to at least choose a moderate senator such as 
john glenn of ohio 
with the proper running mate the south will be for dukakis 
said arkansas democratic party executive director kip blakely 
what he needs is a southern senator 
in addition to glenn other possible vice presidential choices 
include sens albert gore jr of tennessee bill bradley of new 
jersey bob graham of florida lloyd bensten of texas sam nunn of 
georgia and dale bumpers of arkansas 
jackson had a quick retort to those who are pushing southern 
senators laying out his primary record in the region 
no senator no congressperson can match those credentials i 
heard someone say earlier today we need somebody from the south 
well im from the south someone who can win in the south i won 
mississippi alabama georgia south carolina louisiana 
while dukakis wrestles with the jackson problem bush faces a 
big deficit in the polls particularly among the nations women 
and that may suggest that bush could pick a woman for the 
republican ticket breaking down a historic barrier in the party 
i wouldnt want to use the word desperation but that is the 
highrisk high roll scenario said new york pollster lee 
miringoff 
among female candidates most frequently mentioned by bush 
advisers are sen nancy kassebaum of kansas former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole nebraska gov kay orr supreme court 
justice sandra day oconnor and rep lynn martin of illinois 
women are not dopes you dont buy off women with tricks 
said martin the national cochair of the bush campaign i think 
he should have a very good vice president and that may very well be 
a woman the fact that its being mentioned diminishes the 
misconception that conservatives are somehow against the 
advancement of women 
while dukakis is being urged to look south bush too has heard 
geographic arguments 
california gov george deukmejian is the most often mentioned 
westerner but such a selection could cost the gop control of the 
statehouse bush aides have also mentioned sens alan sim william l armstrong 
of colorado and james mcclure of 
idaho as well as rep richard cheney of wyoming 
southerners mentioned at times include white house chief of 
stapson of 
wyomingff howard baker and lamar alexander both from tennessee govs 
thomas kean of new jersey jim thompson of illinois and john sununu 
of new hampshire are also named as potential nominees 
from the midwest a longtime gop stronghold now moving to the 
democrats sen bob dole of kansas is prominently discussed but 
dole illustrates the benefits and dangers of a geographic focus to 
the choice 
if we have a bob dole on the ticket thats going to help in 
iowa eurodollars

new york gov mario cuomo finally endorsed 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis for the democratic presidential 
nomination on wednesday but continued to insist his support was 
never relevant 
a day earlier by winning the lions share of delegates in the 
final four primaries dukakis wrapped up the nomination 
cuomo also said he felt jesse jackson could be a plus for the 
democratic ticket as the vice presidential candidate but said he 
hadnt discussed that with dukakis 
cuomos public endorsement of dukakis came only after some 
semantic toothpulling by reporters at a news conference 
when cuomo revealed that he had talked to dukakis on wednesday 
morning reporters asked the new york governor if they had talked 
about an endorsement cuomo brushed the question aside 
for months i said i was for whoever comes out of the primary 
process first so that was a fait accompli as soon as the 
primaries were over said cuomo 
pressed on the point cuomo said its an empty question i 
gave the endorsement months ago to whoever came out first my 
endorsement was never relevant 
why cant you bring yourself to say that you endorse him 
one exasperated reporter finally asked 
i endorse him i endorse him i endorse him shot back cuomo 
as laughter swept through the news conference there three times 
i endorsed him 
in the days leading up to new yorks crucial april 19 
presidential primary cuomo announced that he would not endorse any 
of the candidates until after the primary season ended after that 
cuomo said he would get behind the frontrunner help him secure the 
nomination 
at the time some speculated that cuomo might be hoping for a 
deadlocked convention that might then turn to him with the 
nomination cuomo denied that and insisted he had ruled out any 
convention draft 
the new york governor repeated his assertion that jackson could 
be good for the democratic ticket 
certainly he could be good for the ticket said cuomo 
how could you say no all those millions of people who voted for 
him thought he was better than gore better than former arizona 
gov bruce babbitt better than delaware sen joseph biden 
better than illinois sen paul simon how could you say he 
wouldnt be good for the ticket

the movement to reform the soviet legal system has 
not led to necessary changes in laws regarding jewish emigration 
attorneys from the international bar association said on wednesday 
one attorney joseph smukler of philadelphia said soviet ideas 
on jewish emigration amount to empty words and empty promises 
he made the comment wednesday at a news conference with jewish 
refuseniks at a moscow apartment 
smukler was one of 250 lawyers including soviet delegates 
who attended a twoday meeting held monday and tuesday in moscow 
soviet lawyers appear to be sincere about reforming the legal 
system yet the emigration problem is not being solved said irwin 
cotler a lawyer from montreal there is a legal revolution going 
on cotler said but the problem is that the revolution does 
not embrace the right of emigration 
he proposed sustained emigration of at least 25000 jews a year 
a policy of allowing complete reunification of families and 
protection of religious and cultural rights 
new soviet emigration laws require an invitation from a close 
relative something that international law lists only as a possible 
additional reason to allow emigration he said 
emigration of soviet jews reached a peak of more than 51000 in 
1979 it dropped to about 1000 a year in 198486 before rising to 
more than 8000 last year about 4500 jews were allowed to 
emigrate between january and may 1988 
two of the main reasons for soviet refusal to allow emigration 
are alleged access to state secrets and refusal of relatives to 
renounce financial claims against those who wish to emigrate 
the international lawyers said one soviet speaker a lawyer from 
the institute of state and law they could identify only as 
katishkin said his institute was studying reforms that could ease 
those restrictions 
but the lawyers reported that soviet officials also said they 
did not want to allow soviet citizens to emigrate to countries with 
fewer social services or to allow mentally ill people or drug 
addicts to emigrate 
michael freeman a law professor at london university said the 
soviet delegates to the conference may as well have been robots 
or automatons for all their capacity for independent thought 
the lawyers said the soviet speaker proposed that restrictions 
on emigration for reasons of access to state secrets be limited to 
five years and that financial claims against wouldbe emigres be 
restricted 
the soviet news agency tass reported tuesday that rudolf 
kuznetsov head of the soviet visa office told the conference that 
soviet emigration laws are based on international law and that the 
number of people being allowed to emigrate has been increasing 
he said 40000 people emigrated from the soviet union in 1987 
and 29000 people left during the first five months of 1988 those 
who left this year are mostly jews armenians and ethnic germans 
he said 
the lawyers said about 20 israeli lawyers attended the 
conference but that another 10 were refused visas 
a british lawyer jonathan arkush said eight other lawyers at 
first were denied visas and the international bar association 
canceled the conference until soviet officials reversed their 
decision 
he said british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe intervened 
to gain visas for him and several other british lawyers

officials canceled final exams and 
graduation for the senior class at fairview high school saying 
they feared a group of students had planned to commit suicide or 
other violence during ceremonies 
its more than just pranks frank kroto fairview school 
district solicitor said wednesday its more than the typical 
end of the year dissatisfaction with authority 
kroto also said several school administrators received personal 
threats and were being protected by police he did not give 
details but state police said troopers were patrolling near some 
administrators homes as if they asked for patrols while on 
vacation 
officials said they have evidence of a suicide pact among 
friends of a senior who fatally shot himself at home with a 
44caliber magnum handgun at christmastime in the presence of 
another student officials said another similar handgun was stolen 
from the dead students home and has not been recovered 
police heard some students were planning to make graduation a 
memorable graduation one that they would never forget the erie 
daily times reported wednesday 
school board president barbara junker who announced the 
cancellation at a tense board meeting tuesday night said several 
students she did not identify threatened to cause serious 
disruption at this years graduation 
mrs junker said officials could not guarantee the safety of 
students and relatives at baccalaureate ceremonies thursday and at 
graduation sunday for 150 seniors 
teachers will issue final grades on the basis of students 
school work the board did not decide how students will receive 
diplomas 
the problem is if one person on this stage shoots himself or 
someone else the board is responsible kroto said at the 
meeting adding that officials have evidence there is a 
possibility this could happen 
kroto said many parents agreed with the boards action but one 
mother who was not identified by the newspaper said officials 
were acting on a bunch of rumors none of them based on any 
evidence 
senior neal loenslein said hes talked to other students has 
found no students with weapons and doesnt believe in the existence 
of a suicide pact 
everyone ive talked to doesnt know anything about guns or 
anything he said its all coming from the administration 
the board he said built all this out of nothing 
state police cpl james scheig in nearby girard said law 
enforcement authorities are not investigating alleged threats of 
violence or the possibility of suicides 
no official complaints have been made to us whatsoever 
scheig said we dont investigate rumors they know that 
he said however troopers are patrolling near certain 
administrators homes we are making passes through their areas 
to make our presence known no big deal scheig said 
kroto said he could not explain what might be driving the 
students to contemplate killing themselves 
one female student told police the four or five students 
involved were from affluent families in this lake erie suburb of 
about 7500 people according to the newspaper which did not 
identify her 
theyre not the leatherjacket types they have a reputation 
as partiers theyre known by everybody the newspaper quoted her 
as saying 
although psychologists and psychiatrists have been working with 
students and teachers since the senior committed suicide mrs 
junker said there was still a certain segment that the counselors 
warn could be potentially threatening to either themselves and 
possibly others 
senior kim zeigler said a psychiatrist told students after the 
suicide that there should be a memorial to the victim in the 1988 
yearbook but she said officials would not allow it 
the administration made everyone so mad that theres 
definitely some kind of danger she said they the 
administration made it like a jail in there like a fortress

divers and a team of specially 
trained dogs joined the search through partially flooded mine 
shafts wednesday for three men still missing after a gas explosion 
ripped through a mine 
three thousand people packed the local community center to pay 
respects to the victims in an emotional ceremony that united 
christians and moslems in their grief thirteen turks were among at 
least 48 miners killed rescue teams found the body of the latest 
victim late wednesday officials said 
the miners died after the powerful methane gas explosion tore 
through the stolzenbach mine on june 1 in borken 70 miles 
northeast of frankfurt 
six of the 57 men trapped in the mine were rescued after 
spending 65 hours buried 500 feet underground 
the zdf television network reported that divers with underwater 
breathing apparatus were enlisted to search because parts of the 
mine were under water 
petercarl ruehland a spokesman for mine owner preussen 
elektra said the divers went into action early wednesday but so 
far had turned up no trace of the missing men 
officials said high levels of deadly carbon monoxide measured 
earlier in the mine shafts made it unlikely that the three missing 
men were alive 
a rotating team of six to eight dogs joined the mine search as 
levels of carbon monoxide receded preussen elektra board member 
heinz cramer said he said the dogs were specially trained for use 
in mines and were scouring areas not filled by water 
a local prosecutor has opened a probe into the explosion 
reportedly to see whether an open flame may have touched off 
the methane gas zdf reported tuesday that reliable sources have 
said that smoking took place in the mine 
the 3000 germans and turks gathered in a local community center 
at midday for a joint lutheran roman catholic and moslem memorial 
service 
i came to mourn my uncle said tolay guersel 24 who 
traveled from his home in munich to attend the service he carried 
a picture of his uncle ali akser akarsu one of the turks who lost 
his life in the mine 
officials from the turkish embassy and turkeys labor minister 
imren aykut also attended the ceremony 
many at the service wept quietly as a lutheran pastor and a 
roman catholic priest read off the names of all 47 miners confirmed 
dead as of wednesday morning along with the names of the missing 
the disaster has deeply shocked the people and left them 
bewildered and speechless said roman catholic bishop johannes 
kapp of nearby fulda 
an orchestra of miners wearing traditional hats with bright 
plumes played solemn music at the service while other miners in 
traditional dress sang in a choir 
many businesses in borken closed so that shop owners and 
employees could attend the ceremony

more than 8000 last year about 4500 jews were allowed to 
emigrate between january and may 1988 
two of the main reasons for soviet refusal to allow emigration 
are alleged access to state secrets and refusal of relatives to 
renounce financial claims against those who wish to emigrate 
the international lawyers said one soviet speaker a lawyer from 
the institute of state and law they could identify only as 
katishkin said his institute was studying reforms that could ease 
those restrictions 
but the lawyers reported that soviet officials also said they 
did not want to allow soviet citizens to emigrate to countries with 
fewer social services or to allow mentally ill people or drug 
addicts to emigrate 
michael freeman a law professor at london university said the 
soviet delegates to the conference may as well have been robots 
or automatons for all their capacity for independent thought 
the lawyers said the soviet speaker proposed that restrictions 
on emigration for reasons of access to state secrets be limited to 
five years and that financial claims against wouldbe emigres be 
restricted 
the soviet news agency tass reported tuesday that rudolf 
kuznetsov head of the soviet visa office told the conference that 
soviet emigration laws are based on international law and that the 
number of people being allowed to emigrate has been increasing 
he said 40000 people emigrated from the soviet union in 1987 
and 29000 people left during the first five months of 1988 those 
who left this year are mostly jews armenians and ethnic germans 
he said 
the lawyers said about 20 israeli lawyers attended the 
conference but that another 10 were refused visas 
a british lawyer jonathan arkush said eight other lawyers at 
first were denied visas and the international bar association 
canceled the conference until soviet officials reversed their 
decision 
he said british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe intervened 
to gain visas for him and several other british lawyers

thousands of radicals hurling 
firebombs and rocks battled riot police wednesday as the government 
began deploying 60000 police to stop students from marching to the 
border with north korea 
students held rallies at many schools nationwide in support of 
the planned march friday to demand south koreas reunification with 
the north violent clashes occurred at more than 10 campuses where 
students dashed out to hurl firebombs and rocks at riot police who 
responded with volleys of tear gas 
it was not known immediately how many people were injured or 
arrested 
drive out the yankees who enforce the partition of our land 
students shouted during the clashes radicals have demanded the 
withdrawal of 42000 us troops based in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact contending the us presence hinders 
reunification of the divided peninsula 
the radicals represent a small but powerful minority on college 
campuses with the most extreme proleftist elements increasingly 
taking control of the protest movement as its support has declined 
radical student leaders have called for up to 40000 students to 
rally at seouls yonsei university on thursday for an overnight 
vigil before the 30mile march to the north korean border 
police said the university would be completely sealed off 
thursday to block the planned rally but student leaders threatened 
to stage violent protests in downtown seoul if the vigil is blocked 
tens of thousands of riot police took positions wednesday around 
campuses and other key locations across the country to stop 
students from rallying in support of the march 
some radicals vowed to commit suicide three students have 
killed themselves in recent antigovernment protests 
police wednesday intercepted students as they marched in protest 
off university campuses in the southern city of kwangju and the 
southeast city of taegu 
in the southern port city of pusan 5000 students from 12 
schools held a common rally at a university before leaving for 
seoul although thousands of police guarded bus terminals and 
railway stations to block their way 
on campuses in other provincial cities students occupied school 
buildings after faculty members refused their demands to provide 
transport 
in an interview with the hankook ilbo an independent seoul 
newspaper president roh taewoo said he supports exchanges and 
debate between south korean and north korean students 
but the president urged students to leave contact with the north 
to official channels and cautioned against leftist or revolutionary 
movements trying to topple south koreas liberal democracy 
opposition party leaders also appealed to students to postpone 
their plans for the march saying it lacked national support 
reunification has been a deeply emotional issue among koreans 
since the peninsula was divided after world war ii into communist 
north korea and prowestern south korea 
most south koreans support unification of the two koreas but 
many fear the north is determined to invade the south as it did in 
1950 
north korea which welcomed the proposed student talks has 
selected a 13member student delegation to attend the planned 
meeting friday at the border village of panmunjom inside the 
demilitarized zone dividing the two koreas

the religious leaders are here for celebrations marking the 
1000th anniversary of christianity in what is now the soviet union 
graham 69 caused controversy when he suggested during a 1982 
visit that there was more religious liberty in this officially 
atheist nation than americans had been led to believe the baptist 
minister said wednesday he saw hopeful signs under mikhail 
gorbachev who became soviet leader in march 1985 
we have heard with great interest that there is an official 
commitment by general secretary gorbachev and other leaders of your 
government to expand the religious rights and opportunities of 
believers and churches graham said upon arrival at moscows 
sheremetyevo airport 
graham said he wanted to learn how glasnost gorbachevs 
policy of openness on selected issues and perestroika his 
program for restructuring the economy had affected religious 
believers 
he and 10 roman catholic cardinals part of the largest vatican 
delegation ever in the soviet union were greeted by metropolitan 
filaret a senior official of the russian church

session might occur monday during a kremlin ceremony marking the 
anniversary 
casaroli the vaticans secretary of state declined to disclose 
the contents of the papal letter 
he called perestroika a good idea 
everything which assures a greater participation of the people 
and greater participation of the church in the society is 
positive casaroli told reporters

ukraine and lithuania 
among the other catholic dignitaries traveling with casaroli are 
cardinal john oconnor of new york and cardinal roger etchegaray 
president of the vaticans justice and peace commission

his execution early friday a corrections official said

injection shortly after 1201 am friday to become the 99th inmate 
executed in the united states since a 1976 us supreme court 
ruling ended a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment 
bishop 36 has said he hopes his death will bring peace to the 
parents of the five boys ages 4 to 13 he sexually molested and 
killed during the late 1970s and early 1980s

well as anyone can corrections department spokesman juan

hours prior to the execution 
bishop will be strapped to the gurney and a solution of sodium

an adviser to a black teenager who claims she 
was abducted and raped by six white men dared the state attorney 
general to show the nation the moral beast you are and arrest 
the girls mother who sought sanctuary in a church after refusing 
to testify about the case 
glenda brawley spent wednesday morning resting and praying 
in ebenezer baptist church in the new york city borough of queens 
said the rev al sharpton an adviser to the family 
mrs brawley 33 was sentenced monday to 30 days in jail for 
defying a grand jury subpoena to testify about the alleged attack 
on her daughter 16yearold tawana 
her advisers have accused local and state authorities of a 
racially motivated coverup and claimed the brawleys cannot get 
justice from the courts 
sharpton appeared outside the church and challenged attorney 
general robert abrams who had given mrs brawley until wednesday 
to appear before the grand jury 
theres nothing legally stopping you from coming in here so 
show the nation the moral beast you are and come through these 
doors and arrest her sharpton said 
shed rather be arrested in the house of god than to be 
sitting in front of a stacked grand jury to participate in the 
hanging of her daughter he said adding but even you mr 
abrams your arms are too short to box with god 
however mrs brawleys attorneys backed off from earlier claims 
that police could not legally arrest mrs brawley in the church 
which dominates an industrial neighborhood 
andrew schnier of the new york state bar associations criminal 
justice section said there was no state or common law that would 
preclude authorities from executing an arrest warrant in a 
religious institution 
a spokesman for abrams who was appointed by gov mario cuomo to 
handle the case said he was prepared to wait before arresting mrs 
brawley 
whether its today tomorrow glenda brawley is no particular 
threat to the public safety or public order said spokesman tim 
gilles who was with abrams in poughkeepsie 85 miles north of new 
york where the grand jury was continuing its investigation 
miss brawley was found lying dazed in a road about 10 miles from 
her poughkeepsie home after having been missing for four days last 
november she was wrapped in a plastic bag her hair shorn with 
animal excrement smeared on her and racial epithets scrawled on her 
body 
miss brawley initially told authorities she was abducted and 
raped by six white men but she and her family have refused to 
cooperate with the grand jury 
sharpton and the familys lawyers c vernon mason and alton 
maddox jr once again called for abrams to step aside and for the 
governor to appoint a special prosecutor sharpton also hinted that 
miss brawley may cooperate with a new impartial prosecutor 
speaking through the media to abrams sharpton said 
if you do not step aside the minute you close your grand jury 
we will only go to the governor and say governor give us a 
prosecutor because we have a new witness and new evidence her 
name is tawana brawley 
the grand jury would likely wind up its probe in a month or 
so if the brawleys do not cooperate gilles said 
were prepared to stay here as long as it takes mason said 
outside the church mrs brawley was invited to seek religious 
asylum and sanctuary at the church by its pastor rev timothy 
mitchell he added 
mrs brawley did not appear outside black reporters from a 
radio station were allowed inside but said they did not see mrs 
brawley all other reporters were barred by a welldressed man

the defense department stripped a record 284 
contractors of their right to bid for military work because of 
wrongdoing during the first half of fiscal 1988 according to a 
pentagon report released wednesday 
in addition the bidding rights of another 173 contractors were 
suspended temporarily and 2373 civilian and military indictments 
were obtained alleging contracting improprieties 
the new figures are contained in a semiannual report to 
congress by the pentagons inspector general previously the 
record for debarring defense contractors of bidding rights during a 
sixmonth period was the 275 reported for the last half of fiscal 
1987 
during all of fiscal 1987 the defense department debarred 505 
individuals and companies of their right to bid on contracts an 
annual record 
the latest report which covers the period from oct 1 1987 to 
march 31 also found that pentagon and us army corps of engineers 
auditors saved the government an estimated 31 billion during the 
sixmonth period by challenging questionable awards or future 
contracting plans 
to produce those savings the auditors issued more than 26000 
reports and questioned more than 576 billion in contract costs 
the report said 
another 27 billion was reported saved during the period 
through followup audits aimed at completing cases that originally 
led to management disputes over the auditors recommendations 
among some of the more significant investigative actions cited 
during the period were the racketeering and bribery convictions of 
defense employees at the clothing directorate of a philadelphia 
procurement center a costmischarging case settled by motorola 
inc for 99 million a defective pricing and illegal gratuities 
case against the eaton corp that produced 95 million in 
restitution and a huge defective pricing case settled with bell 
helicopter textron inc for more than 85 million 
the inspector general by law maintains a staff of auditors and 
investigators who operate independently outside the control of top 
pentagon executives the latest report is dated may 30 but was not 
released until wednesday 
in a foreword to the report inspector general june gibbs brown 
wrote the figures demonstrated our commitment to vigorous 
innovative efforts to achieve the widest possible cooperation in 
fighting the misuse of dollars appropriated for the defense of our 
country 
on the investigative side the inspector general said there were 
294 indictments during the period obtained by the justice 
department on the pentagons behalf plus another 143 indictments 
at the local state or foreign level and 1936 recommendations for 
courtsmartial

recover 2453 million during the first half of the year thanks to 
completed investigations another record plus another 359 
million in fines penalties and restitutions and 237 million in 
civil settlements and judgments 
the pentagons fraud hotline meantime fielded 5449 reports

americans continued to entrust their money to 
savings institutions in april despite increasing publicity about 
sampl bailouts and closings the government said wednesday 
the federal home loan bank board said net deposits at the 3113 
federally insured thrift institutions increased by 12 billion to 
9624 billion in april the seventh consecutive monthly increase 
the steady deposit gains continue to indicate consumer 
confidence in thrifts as a secure haven for funds the bank board 
said in a statement 
deposit growth slowed in april when compared with the 43 
billion jump in march but bank board economist james barth said 
deposit receipts normally decline in april as people pay their 
federal income taxes he said the slowdown this year was milder 
than usual 
net deposits during the first four months of this year totaled 
163 billion that was a reversal of the trend a year ago when 
there were net withdrawals of 143 billion in the same period 
the growth occurred as the bank board stepped up the pace of sampl 
closings so far this year 37 institutions have been closed or 
with government assistance merged into other sampls 
the general accounting office the auditing arm of congress 
warned last month that in several years there may not be enough 
money coming into the federal savings and loan insurance corp to 
resolve the cases of the estimated 500 insolvent institutions 
however congress has pledged the full faith and credit of the 
united states in backing the accounts should fslic run dry 
deposits had drained steadily from sampls during much of 1987 in 
what analysts called a slowmotion run but after the october 
market crash many investors sought the safety of federally insured 
accounts and pulled their money out of stocks 
the bank board report a summary of sampl balance sheets 
highlighted a more worrisome trend the continued decline of thrift 
institutions capital 
capital represents the money that would be left over for an 
institutions owners should all its assets be sold and liabilities 
paid off the more capital an institution has the less danger 
there is that it will become insolvent 
the industrys capital declined by 390 million in april 
following a 27 billion decline in march however 12 billion of 
the march drop was attributed to losses at a single institution 
sunbelt savings association in dallas 
in the first four months of 1988 capital declined by 385 
billion compared with a gain of 137 billion in the comparable 
period of 1987 
the report also said the thrift industry increased its mortgage 
lending in april to 186 billion up 200 million from march but 
24 percent below a year ago 
analysts expect a decline in mortgage lending as rising interest 
rates slow home buying and building this summer

six major news organizations on wednesday 
asked the judge in the irancontra conspiracy case to allow 
reporters to attend a closed pretrial hearing scheduled to be held 
on monday in us district court here 
the news organizations which include the abc and cbs television 
networks and the new york times asked us district judge gerhard 
a gesell to open the hearing where government officials are 
scheduled to testify about how witnesses were briefed before they 
were questioned by the irancontra grand jury 
gesell ordered the hearing to determine whether or not 
government officials who appeared before the grand jury had been 
exposed to the immunized congressional testimony of oliver north 
and two codefendants when they were prepared by government lawyers 
for the grand jury sessions 
north former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
arms dealer albert hakim have moved to dismiss the 23count 
indictment on the ground that the prosecution and the grand jury 
made impermissible use of the congressional testimony the 
defendants gave last year under limited grants of immunity from 
prosecution 
in explaining why he scheduled the closed hearing gesell said 
in a brief june 2 order that it is expected the testimony may to 
some extent involve classified materials and to some degree relate 
to matters of attorneyclient privilege 
gesell also said that he would promptly release a transcript of 
the hearing after deleting any classified or privileged material 
in seeking to open the hearing the news organizations argued 
that gesell had not met supreme court requirements for closing the 
hearing the closure of a portion of a criminal trial must always 
be done with the utmost caution and deliberation said a joint 
brief filed by six news organizations which also included the wall 
street journal the washington post and the los angeles times 
the need for such caution is especially evident in this case 
since it involves issues of such national interest and 
importance the brief said 
the news organizations contended that the mere fact that 
certain material may be classified is not in itself sufficient to 
warrant automatic closure of an entire hearing 
at most it would justify exclusion of the press and the 
public from that portion of the hearing at which classified 
information was discussed the brief said it said that gesells 
order does not explain why partial closure is not sufficient to 
protect secret information

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on wednesday invited the united states to join the 
soviet union in banning all nuclear tests as part of a sweeping new 
disarmament proposal 
speaking to the un special session on disarmament 
shevardnadze said the goal was a stepbystep elimination of 
nuclear weapons by the year 2000 
he also called for the north atlantic treaty organization and 
the warsaw pact to each reduce their forces by 500000 troops 
for the first time shevardnadze declared that the soviet union 
would announce the presence or absence of nuclear weapons on naval 
ships on foreign port calls if the united states and western allies 
do the same 
the united states has consistently refused to confirm or deny 
whether its ships are nuclearpowered or carry nuclear weapons 
hailing the ussoviet treaty to scrap medium and 
shorterrange missiles as a turning point in the history of arms 
control shevardnadze invited un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar and other officials to witness the destruction of one of 
the first batches of missiles 
in a news conference later soviet arms negotiator anatoly 
krapov said the destruction of the missles would begin soon after 
july 1 
vernon a walters us ambassador to the united nations called 
shevardnadzes 45minute address extremely interesting 
it broke a lot of new ground and it is deserving of study 
walters said 
in 1985 the soviet union announced a unilateral nuclear test 
moratorium that began on aug 6 the anniversary of the atomic 
bombing of hiroshima the united states continued testing and the 
soviets ended their moratorium one and a half years later 
our invariable position on a nuclear testing moratorium is 
still valid shevardnadze said on the basis of reciprocity 
with the united states we are ready to reintroduce and to observe 
it this time not for a year and a half but for all times 
he said the moscow summit between soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and president reagan has shown that despite their 
profound differences the soviet union and the united states can 
cooperate 
on conventional disarmament the area in which nato says the 
soviets hold a clear advantage in europe shevardnadze proposed an 
exchange of all official data on troop strength followed by 
onsite inspections to verify the information 
he said the second phase in the negotiations would deal with 
cutbacks in the armed forces of each side by approximately 500000 
men and the third would entail further reductions that would give 
nato and the warsaw pact a defensive character and their 
offensive nucleus would be dismantled 
the only sour note in an otherwise optimistic speech was 
shevardnadzes claim that the accords for the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan are being violated 
in a news conference held later the soviet deputy foreign 
minister vladimir petrovsky said pakistan was the target of the 
criticism 
shevardnadze told the delegates when one party observes its 
obligations under the geneva agreements while the other party is 
violating them this naturally causes us to have doubts about our 
partner and to refuse to trust him 
the united nations helped negotiate a pact signed in geneva 
which calls for the withdrawal of more than 100000 red army troops 
from afghanistan within a year and the repatriation of millions of 
afghan refugees 
pakistan and afghanistan signed the accords with the soviet 
union and the united states signing as guarantors 
the soviet foreign minister also called for 
a global ban on chemical weapons 
establishment of an international monitoring and verification 
agency under the united nations it would coordinate and monitor 
arms reduction agreements verify compliance and monitor the 
military situation in conflict areas 
preventing the introduction of weapons into outer space and 
establishment of an international space monitoring agency 
restrictions on sales and supplies of conventional arms 
limits on development of more destructive conventional arms and 
new technologies such as laser beams genetic and electromagnetic 
systems 
including naval forces in disarmament negotiations he rejected 
the idea that naval forces are offlimits to arms control talks 
creation of un naval forces of permanent security council 
members and proposed a joint trial in which the member fleets would 
practice maintaining freedom of navigation by un forces 
the united states and many western countries which have naval 
forces in the middle east have opposed a un force as unworkable

the reagan administration on wednesday 
proposed changing the way the government spends some 750 million a 
year on training hardcore disadvantaged youths for jobs 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin said the administration plans to 
send a bill to congress in the next two weeks that would allow 
local communities to expand the current summeronly program to a 
yearround effort 
it also would change the formula used for allocating the funds 
in order to shift more of them to inner cities where youth 
unemployment is highest particularly among black teenagers 
the current formula established by congress is based on local 
unemployment rates generally the new formula would be based on 
census bureau data on the percentage of disadvantaged youths in a 
communitys population 
we have been concerned for some time on how to reach the most 
disadvantaged youths mrs mclaughlin told the employment 
subcommittee of the senate labor committee cyclical changes in 
unemployment rates may cause large funding swings under the current 
formula that are unrelated to the youth poverty situation in a 
local area 
the program under title iib of the job training partnership act 
now provides about 900 each for sixweek jobtraining programs in 
the summer for about 800000 youths ages 14 to 21 each year 
robert jones assistant labor secretary for job training said 
the changes would allow communities to spend up to 2000 or 3000 
on each youth in the program 
technically we would serve a few less he said but we 
would serve them much more effectively you cant address the youth 
unemployment issue just in terms of numbers you have to do it 
qualitatively 
unemployment among teenagers is about three times the overall 
civilian jobless rate of 56 percent although joblessness among 
black teenagers has declined more than 15 percentage points since 
the early 1980s it is still more than six times the overall rate

east germany expressed readiness wednesday to aid 
jews who survived the nazi holocaust 
the official news agency adn quoted foreign ministry spokesman 
wolfgang meyer as saying the communist government is now prepared 
to give humanitarian aid and assistance to jewish victims in other 
countries 
that appears to reverse previous policy east germany formed in 
1949 has said it bore no legal or moral responsibility for the 
actions of adolf hitlers third reich 
adn said the decision came after contacts with jewish leaders in 
and outside the country and the kind and amount of help are 
still under discussion 
heinz galinski chairman of the german jewish council said 
monday the east german government was prepared to pay up to 100 
million to jewish victims 
galinski who lives in west berlin said the money would be 
offered as aid for holocaust survivors who are in need of

president reagan sent congress legislation on 
wednesday to make permanent the ban on use of federal funds for 
abortions unless the life of the mother is endangered the white 
house said 
currently the antiabortion provision is included annually in 
the appropriation act for the department of health and human 
services 
in his letter to congress reagan said this important 
legislation carries out my commitment to protect the rights of 
unborn children by prohibiting federal dollars from being used to 
fund abortion unless a mothers life would be physically endangered 
by carrying the fetus to term 
reagan said the bill would enact the socalled hyde amendment 
named for rep henry hyde rill on a permanent basis 
enacting this prohibition on the funding of abortion in 
general legislation will exend its application to all agencies and 
to all federal funds reagan said 
reagans domestic policy adviser gary bauer said the bill was 
to fulfill a pledge reagan made in his last state of the union 
address to try to make the amendment permanent 
but kate michelman the executive director of the national 
abortion rights action league called it a a last ditch effort 
on the part of the administration 
i dont believe congress is prepared to go that far to 
institutionalize this forever she said

secretary of state george p shultz tried 
to clear some obstacles wednesday to a new agreement on us bases 
in spain which is the newest nato member and is evicting 72 us 
jet fighters 
shultz sought to speed negotiations on american use of the naval 
base at rota in southwestern spain and two joint air facilities 
in time for signing before the summer holiday of prime minister 
felipe gonzalez and his government 
rota is an important support post for the us 6th fleet which 
patrols the mediterranean 
before shultz met with foreign minister francisco fernandez 
ordonez however the spanish official was quoted as saying the 
secretarys 72hour visit would not accelerate the accord 
during the meeting we will clarify certain points but nothing 
else he said staterun television 
after their talk shultz said these discussions are good and 
it was a worthwhile investment of an hour fernandez said the 
meeting was very positive and constuctive but theres still 
work to be done 
shultz also briefed prime minister gonzalez on wednesday about 
the ussoviet summit meeting in moscow and his unsuccessful 
effort for arabisraeli negotiations 
the bulk of the discussion was devoted to the bases agreement 
with the secretary expressing our thought that this ought to be 
moved to completion a senior us official said 
the official who spoke with journalists on condition his name 
not be used would not predict when the new defense agreement would 
be finished any time you are in one of these negotiations you 
dont have an agreement until you have an agreement he said 
shultz also paid a courtesy call on king juan carlos 
the senior us official was asked about a report that prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of israel said in new york he had not 
discussed the specifics of the us peace plan with shultz in the 
middle east 
i really dont know what hes talking about they talked about 
the middle east at length the official said 
when questioned about a report that president hafez assad of 
syria asked shultz to open contacts with iran the official said it 
never happened 
spain has ordered f16 fighter jets of the 401st tactical 
fighter wing to leave torrejon air base outside madrid forcing the 
units relocation at a projected cost of 500 million 
on june 4 the italian government agreed to accept the 72 jets 
subject to parliamentary approval they are to leave spain within 
three years after the new bases agreement is signed 
moving the fighter wing will cost washington an estimated 150 
million the us share of contributions to the infrastructure fund 
of the north atlantic treaty organization the fund will finance 
the move unless nato defense ministers decide on an another 
approach 
the united states also has agreed to pay an estimated 12 
million of the total cost of recreational facilities at the new 
f16 base in italy 
lord carrington of britain the nato secretarygeneral said 
i think the outcome is very satisfactory if the alliance as a 
whole had not decided to ask italy and decided to pay for the 
transfer this would have sent a wholly wrong signal to the united 
states in connection with european interest in the defense of 
the southern flank 
carrington addressed a news conference the day before the spring 
meeting of the north atlantic council the first to be held in 
spain since it became the 16th member of nato in may 1982 
several administrative and other obstacles hold up completion of 
a new eightyear defense accord between the united states and spain 
announced jan 15 when the united states agreed to move the f16s 
president dwight d eisenhower and gen francisco franco the 
spanish dictator signed the first agreement in 1953 franco died 
in 1975 
the reagan administration is encouraged by the fact that the 
next extension will be for eight years rather than the usual five 
and that no us aid to spain will be tied to it 
gonzalez saw his socialist partys second electoral victory two 
years ago as a mandate to evict the us planes from torrejon a 
jointuse base just outside madrid 
in a referendum gonzalez called in march 1986 spaniards 
approved retaining nato membership but on condition the us 
military presence be reduced spain be free of nuclear weapons and 
its armed forces stay outside the integrated nato command 
spaniards tend to view us military bases as a symbol of 
american support for franco 
negotiations began two years ago when spain indicated it would 
seek a reduction in us military forces in keeping with the 
referendum results

legislation approved by the house on wednesday 
would require telephones to be compatible with hearing aids 
the measure was passed 39115 a similar bill is pending in the 
senate 
the bill would require compatibility for all phones made in or 
imported into the united states one year after enactment of the 
measure mobile cellular and secure phones would be exempt 
cordless phones would be exempt for three years after enactment 
we simply cannot confine the hearing impaired to a world of 
silence said rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the 
house commerce and energy subcommittee on telecommunications 
more than half of the estimated 4 million hearingaid users in 
the united states use a hearing aid equipped with a telecoil 
which cuts the feedback a user would otherwise hear when talking on 
the telephone 
some hearing aidwearers pick up highpitched squeals when they 
use some noncompatible telephones especially those made abroad 
current law requires essential phones to be 
telecoilcompatible these include coinoperated phones and phones 
that are creditcard operated in places where no coin phone is 
nearby

israeli troops on wednesday shot and killed 
three guerrillas north of israels selfproclaimed security zone in 
southern lebanon the army said 
the troops were searching for rocket launching sites and 
guerrilla strongholds when they spotted a guerrilla ring and opened 
fire an army spokesman said he said there were no army casualties 
israel radio said the guerrillas were apparently on their way to 
carry out an attack in the security zone a sixto10 mile wide 
strip of land north of the israeli border 
troops discovered three bodies while searching the area of the 
clash the radio said 
neither the army spokesman nor the radio identified the group to 
which the guerrillas belonged the location of the clash also was 
not disclosed 
the incursion north of the security zone was the first reported 
by the army since a twoday operation early last month in which 
three israeli soldiers were killed and 17 wounded forty guerrillas 
of the iranianbacked shiite moslem hezbollah party of god 
movement were killed 
on may 25 about 600 israelibacked lebanese militiamen assisted 
by israeli artillery and helicopters again attacked hezbollah 
strongholds forty hezbollah guerrillas were killed and about 30 
wounded in clashes five militiamen were also wounded 
israel radio quoted a senior officer in the armys northern 
command as calling wednesdays search operation a routine mission 
on the security zones border carried out by a small infantry 
force 
israel established its security zone in june 1985 when it 
withdrew the bulk of its troops from lebanon following a threeyear 
occupation the zone is patrolled by israeli troops and 
israelibacked lebanese militiamen

throwing american military might into the 
fight against drug smugglers wont work because suppliers will find 
a way to meet the growing demand in the united states the head of 
the congressional general accounting office said wednesday 
as long as the demand stays high sealing the borders probably 
isnt realistic comptroller general charles bowsher told the 
senate armed services committee 
asked if adding us military forces to the overworked civilian 
law enforcement agencies will help cut drug smuggling bowsher 
replied i dont think we have any statistics that show thats 
going to happen 
military assets are only a marginal assist to the antidrug 
efforts he said 
bowsher noted that even though the amounts of drugs seized have 
increased so have the amounts which slipped through the net 
because drug traffickers have the ability to increase production 
sharply 
bowsher made clear he wasnt suggesting abandoning efforts to 
interdict drugs but he told the panel that an increasing number 
of drug experts believe that the root cause of our national drug 
problem is the demand for illegal drugs 
since our current approach is not working it is time to 
consider devoting more emphasis and more resources aimed at 
reducing demand prevention treatment and research on the causes 
and extent of drug abuse he said 
bowshers assessment was offered as the committee opened a 
series of hearings into proposals to have the pentagon become more 
deeply involved in the antidrug effort 
the house last month voted to order president reagan to have the 
armed forces essentially seal us borders against smugglers the 
senate approved a lessexpanded military role but did decide to 
give navy officers arrest powers for drug boats seized in 
international waters 
the two proposals were added to each chambers defense budget 
bill for the fiscal year starting oct 1 differences between the 
measures including the antidrug provisions will be worked out by 
a housesenate conference committee 
military officials have opposed a wider pentagon role in the 
drug war saying the armed forces lack the necessary training and 
equipment 
sen sam nunn dga the armed services committee chairman 
said it was time to set aside rhetoric and passion and make 
significant improvement in the war on drugs 
sen john warner rva top republican on the panel said 
congress is on a stampede and we need some direction we need 
to try and corral this stampede and point it in the right 
direction 
bowsher said federal officials estimate hey are seizing only 20 
to 25 percent of the cocaine and 10 percent of the marijuana being 
illegally imported into the united states 
if the pentagon does get involved drug traffickers will likely 
react by trying other ways to get the drugs into the united states 
bowsher said 
whenever interdiction has been effectivein the past they 
have been able to move to other ways of importing the drugs he 
said 
he said increasing military support would probably result in 
more drug seizures and arrests and but it may not significantly 
reduce drug supplies because traffickers have shown the ability 
to increase the overall amount involved 
but the military impact could be large he noted pentagon 
officials believe a substantial increase in military assistance 
could adversely affect military readiness 
in addition he noted increasing the military role would be a 
significant departure form this countrys longstanding tradition of 
separating national defense and civilian law enforcement 
responsibilities 
that separations chief legal expression is the posse comitatus 
act an 1878 law that bars using the military to enforce civilian 
laws 
it was amended seven years ago to permit the military to help in 
the antidrug effort but that aid has chiefly been limited to a 
supporting role the militarys major effort has been spotting and 
tracking suspected drug boats or planes 
the federal government is now spending three times more money on 
reducing the supply of drugs than on reducing demand according to 
a gao study 
but the watchdog agency concluded that despite the increased 
funding there is a continuing heavy demand for drugs by us 
consumers americans want drugs and they are willing to pay a high 
price to get them 
bowshers assessment was seconded by a rand corp study that 
said an increased role for the military isnt likely to do much 
good

rightwing rebels said wednesday they 
will no longer authorize red cross activities throughout most of 
mozambique claiming troops launched devastating attacks on 
designated red cross aid drop sites 
the mozambican national resistance said airborne forces attacked 
such sites june 36 killing 217 civilians and wounding 391 
it said in a note released in lisbon that during those three 
days air force planes dropped napalm bombs on civilians who were 
supposed to receive red cross food and medical attention at mulumbo 
and derre in zambezia province and tambara in manica province 
the note signed by the rebel groups spokesman in lisbon 
manuel frank said mozambican zimbabwean and tanzanian paratroops 
took part in the attacks 
the rebel note said those gathered at the cities included no 
rebel guerrillas and that no rebel bases exist in the towns that 
were bombed 
however the note contradicted itself by saying the towns were 
under the rebels control at the time of the attacks 
afonso dhlakama leader of the mozambican national resistance 
has decided to withdraw authorization for free movement by 
the red cross in the provinces of nampula zambezia and manica 
until the situation is clarified according to the note 
it said the rebels will allow the red cross to keep operating 
its humanitarian programs in neighboring sofala province 
the rebel group has fought to topple the marxist government 
since 1977 two years after the southern african nation achieved 
independence from portugal 
the rebels and and south africa have denied repeated mozambican 
charges that south africa has kept supplying the rebels despite a 
1984 mozambicansouth african nonaggression pact

thousands of musicloving muscovites huddled under 
umbrellas in summer showers as the new york philharmonic and a 
soviet orchestra joined in a wednesday evening concert capped by a 
fireworks display 
zubin mehta music director for the philharmonic and soviet 
conductor gennady rozhdestvensky drew shouts of bravo bravo 
after each led the 200member orchestra 
the covered stage in moscows gorky park resembled a 
checkerboard of musicians with the soviets from the state symphony 
orchestra of the ministry of culture dressed in black and the 
americans in white in each row an american and soviet sat next to 
one another accentuating the pattern 
the concert was the seventh and final engagement in the 
philharmonics 10day tour of the soviet union which ends 
thursday the orchestra gave previous performances in leningrads 
bolshoi hall and three at moscows tchaikovsky hall 
may we thank you on the last day of our tour for your 
incredible hospitality and the warmth of your public that we will 
not forget for a long time mehta told the audience in gorky park 
prior to the concert 
rozhdestvensky was first on the program with dmitri 
shostakovichs symphony no 5 followed by mehta conducting 
hector berliozs symphonie fantastique 
the concert began under threatening skies and gusts of wind but 
when the rain began about 20 minutes into the program only a few 
people left 
musicians left their seats during the fireworks display and 
moved to the front of the stage to watch the multicolored bursts 
above the roof of the theater rozhdestvensky his arm draped 
around mehtas shoulders watched from the front edge of the stage 
although they listen intently at concerts soviets generally are 
restrained in their applause but the philharmonic drew sustained 
and loud applause at each of its concerts 
i enjoyed it so much said 53yearold tanya lesina its 
the first time for me hearing someone coming from new york i

president francois mitterrand appealed wednesday to 
french voters to elect a national assembly majority that will help 
his socialist government carry out its programs 
mitterrands socialists and a centerright coalition ran almost 
even in the popular vote after the first round of voting sunday 
but computer projections gave the socialists an edge in next 
sundays runoff elections 
i need to carry out my mission a stable majority ready to 
vote without delay for laws on social justice equality of 
opportunity national solidarity and economic modernization 
mitterrand said at a weekly cabinet meeting led by premier michel 
rocard 
the statement was released by mitterrands spokesman hubert 
vedrine 
mitterrand called early legislative elections less than a week 
after his may 8 reelection to a second sevenyear term 
on wednesday mitterrand spoke out for the first time in the 
legislative campaign he had said previously that he would get 
involved only if necessary 
in his statement the socialist president said he hoped for the 
largest possible majority behind the values of liberty equality 
and respect for others and said it was his duty to warn french 
voters against any coalition of electoral interests that might be 
lacking in these principles 
rocard said later the president intended to criticize the 
relations between the centerright alliance and the racist and 
xenophobic extreme right 
the extremeright national front of jeanmarie le pen and the 
conservative coalition agreed tuesday not to run against each other 
in key districts in and around the southern port of marseilles 
where the runoff would otherwise have split the vote three ways and 
made a socialist victory more likely 
socialist leaders denounced the deal while conservatives 
defended it as a purely local accord similar to those made by the 
socialists and communists 
but former socialist premier laurent fabius said the accord with 
the national front was a dishonor for those who signed it 
in sundays election candidates who won more than 50 percent of 
the vote in the first round automatically won seats in the assembly 
in 455 of the 577 districts candidates who drew less than 50 
percent but at least 125 percent of the vote in the first round 
are to participate in sundays runoff

service fees paid by checking account 
customers of banks and savings associations took a sharp jump in 
the past year according to a survey released wednesday by a 
national consumer group 
the consumer federation of america said annual fees on 
interestbearing now accounts on average rose from 8671 in 1987 
to 9533 this year a 99 percent increase meanwhile annual fees 
on noninterest accounts rose an average 37 percent from 9896 
to 10263 
the federation a coalition of 200 national state and local 
groups surveyed 110 banks and 84 savings institutions in 15 states 
and the district of columbia in april however yeartoyear 
comparisons are based only on the 133 institutions sampled in both 
years 
fees for bounced checks were up 17 percent from an average of 
1337 in 1987 to 1361 this year 
at the same time fees rose interest rates on checking account 
balances were falling the federation said from an average of 466 
percent to 432 percent 
thirtysix of 132 institutions lowered the interest they paid on 
now account balances under 1000 while 22 increased rates the 
rest did not change the rate 
high balance requirements and high fees have combined to make 
interestbearing checking accounts unavailable to nearly half of 
all american families the organization said in a report 
detailing the survey 
the fees have placed checking accounts out of the reach of 
many lowincome consumers a hundred dollars in charges is simply 
too much for a family struggling to keep that amount in an account 
after paying its monthly bills it said 
however a spokeswoman for the american bankers association the 
largest trade group in the industry rejected the consumer groups 
criticism saying a bank is a business not a public utility 
prices for bank products and services are set in a competitive 
marketplace and correspond to local market demands and rising 
operational costs said aba spokeswoman maryliz meany 
she said monthly account fees were low through the 1970s because 
banks were banned by law from paying interest on checking accounts 
when congress deregulated interest rates banks began charging fees 
to reflect the cost of the accounts she said 
nevertheless she said banks are among the few industries 
financial or otherwise that offer basic low cost accounts to 
their customers 
she said 52 percent of the banks surveyed by the aba last year 
offered no frills accounts for an average 2 to 3 a month 
such accounts have average balances of 300 to 400 and often 
restrict the number of times a customer can write a check and visit 
a teller or use a teller machine 
another 6 percent of banks questioned had plans to begin 
offering basic accounts she said

the judge in the irancontra case ordered four 
separate trials wednesday to allow oliver north and three 
codefendants to use each others immunized congressional testimony 
to defend against the charges 
us district judge gerhard a gesell gave independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh until friday to decide whether to proceed first 
with a trial of north on 16 charges or to try former national 
security adviser john m poindexter on seven counts 
the judge said arms dealers richard v secord and albert hakim 
could be tried individually after north and poindexter go to trial 
separately on charges they conspired to defraud the government by 
illegally diverting usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
although the severance was requested by the defense gesells 
ruling could be a boost to the prosecutions ability surmount legal 
difficulties posed by the congressional immunity given three of the 
four defendants 
the judge appeared to have devised a solution to the immunity 
problems that he previously had said were most troublesome to him 
north a fired national security council aide and a retired 
marine lieutenant colonel poindexter and hakim were granted 
socalled use immunity by congress for their testimony at the 
irancontra hearings last year secord testified before congress 
without such immunity 
under the law walsh cannot use the congressional testimony of 
an individual defendant as evidence against that person under the 
limited immunity grants 
but gesell said any defendant should have considerable leeway 
to use indirectly and possibly directly immunized testimony 
while defending the charges against him 
each of the three defendants who gave immunized testimony 
revealed information which one or more of the defendants considers 
helpful to his own defense if not exonerating some aspect of the 
case gesell said 
each defendant has contemplated using immunized testimony of 
other witnesses gesell said noting statements by hakim and 
secord that the congressional testimony of north and poindexter 
would help their cases 
accordingly separate trials are needed because trying the 
defendants jointly would compromise each defendants fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination and the sixth amendment 
right to challenge the testimony of a codefendant or another 
witness through crossexamination the judge said 
at an earlier hearing gesell said he had been troubled by the 
conflict between these two constitutional rights that would 
inevitably occur at a joint trial of all four defendants 
four trials also will free walsh to use the immunized testimony 
of one defendant against another under the useimmunity law 
poindexters testimony for example may be used against north and 
the other defendants but not against the former national security 
adviser 
the prosecution also could use the testimony of a convicted 
defendant against another defendant subsequent trials 
walsh who had urged a joint trial of the four defendants 
declined to comment on the judges decision saying only that 
everyone realizes that four trials are more burdensome than one 
but the judge feels that thats a necessary requirement to protect 
the constitutional rights of all four defendants 
walsh declined to say whether he would try poindexter or north 
first 
gesell meanwhile said he had not made final decisions on 
whether the congressional immunity posed such a serious problem as 
to preclude trying the cases at all 
but gesells decision to give each of the defendants separate 
trials may seriously undermine the defense argument that the 
immunity problem requires dismissal of the charges altogether 
the judge said he would decide that and other major pretrial 
issues by july 1 so he could set a date for a prompt trial 
the judge provisionally denied a defense motion to continue the 
trials until after the november election saying prospective jurors 
would have to be questioned about whether political discussions 
about the irancontra affair would undermine their impartiality 
gesells ruling however could help secord hakim and north 
who want to use the immunized congressional testimony as evidence 
they acted under the authority of poindexter the former national 
security adviser and retired navy rear admiral told congress he 
authorized the diversion of arms sales profits to the contras 
but during arguments on the issue earlier wednesday walsh said 
poindexter knew very well he had no power to authorize the 
diversion of iran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels his 
lack of power was obvious to anyone with intelligence walsh said 
walsh also hinted that other minor participants in the 
irancontra case still may be charged 
all of the peripheral figures have been carefully left out 
of the 23count indictment returned against the four defendants in 
march the prosecutor said they will be dealt with differently 
later he did not say who may be charged 
besides the three charges involving the diversion conspiracy 
against all four defendants poindexter is accused in four separate 
counts of obstructing congressional inquiries about the irancontra 
affair and making false statements to congress 
north also is charged with lying to congress about efforts to 
help the contras obstructing attorney general edwin meese iiis 
inquiry into the irancontra affair in 1986 with false statements 
and destroying documents 
he also is charged with accepting an illegal gratuity by 
allowing secord to install a 15000 security fence around his 
house and obstructing an fbi investigation of who paid for it and 
with converting to his personal use 4300 of the 90000 in 
travelers checks a contra leader gave him to cover expenses he and 
others incurred to help the nicaraguan rebels and seek release of 
us hostages in lebanon 
he is also charged with conspiring with two conservative 
fundraisers to illegally use a taxexempt foundation to raise 
money for the nonexempt purpose of arming the contras

the senate voted approval wednesday of a bill 
designed to curb violence on television 
the measure sponsored by sen paul simon dill exempts 
members of the television industry from federal antitrust laws for 
three years to allow them to work together to develop voluntary 
standards on tv violence 
the bill was approved on a voice vote the action sends the bill 
to the house where the judiciary committee plans to hold hearings 
shortly 
a similar bill also sponsored by simon was approved by the 
senate in october 1986 but the measure was a casualty of an 
endofthesession logjam in the house 
the tv networks and others in the tv industry have argued that 
antitrust laws prevent them from taking joint action to develop 
standards on violence 
in hearings last year before the senate judiciary committee 
experts cited studies and reports that excessive violence on tv 
incites aggressive behavior in children 
the american civil liberties union however found 
constitutional problems with the bill because it would set a 
precedent for government to influence the viewpoints presented in 
the media

the nations largest presbyterian denomination 
prepared wednesday to consider a proposed policy statement 
condemning even the slightest government involvement in church 
affairs 
the policy entitled god alone is lord of the conscience 
would have the 3millionmember presbyterian church usa oppose 
government denials of taxexempt status from religious institutions 
that violate federal laws and attempts to deprogram members of 
cults 
it also would oppose prayer in public schools and the use of 
substantial public funds by religious schools and would defend the 
right of clergy and laity to take part in public affairs including 
running for public office 
the church opened the first full day of its annual meeting 
wednesday by electing rev dr c kenneth hall 63 as moderator 
or chief spokesman for the denomination 
hall pastor of the 640member hill united presbyterian church 
in butler pa defeated four other candidates on the first ballot 
of the 630 delegates 
he said the unusual firstballot win reflected delegates 
concern over the loss of 300000 members since 1983 when the 
denomination was formed by merging the former united presbyterian 
church in the united states of america and the presbyterian church 
in the united states the southern stream 
hall said his victory gave him a mandate to concentrate on 
evangelism and healing in the church he selected 50yearold ruth 
montoya of arvada colo as vice moderator 
the proposed policy paper says government intrudes on religious 
freedom by denying tax exemptions designating churches as 
landmarks and using zoning laws to prohibit church programs 
it calls for the church to continue attention to court cases 
concerning religious liberty and efforts to assure competent legal 
advice on these issues 
the paper prepared by the churchs advisory council on church 
and society was given to the committee on justice and social 
issues for review the full assembly is to vote on the paper 
tuesday the secondlast day of the meeting 
the paper criticizes the us supreme court decision revoking 
the tax exempt status of bob jones university a fundamentalist 
school in south carolina because the independent school did not 
follow federal equal opportunity guidelines 
the paper also criticizes state laws sanctioning forced 
deprogramming of cult members saying the charge of 
brainwashing is exaggerated and the response of deprogramming under 
physical restraint is indefensible 
the paper adds that it is undoubtedly true that television 
evangelists manipulate more peoples emotions in our society than 
do proselytizing cults the paper opposes a constitutional 
amendment to permit public schools to sponsor prayer and the 
use of substantial public funds to support private educational 
systems including tax deductions or credits and use of educational 
vouchers 
presbyterian clergy and laity have a right and responsibility to 
be involved in public affairs including holding elective office 
the paper says 
it also reaffirms the churchs opposition to the appointment of 
a us ambassador to the vatican 
the paper expresses concern about government refusal to 
recognize conduct motivated by conscience such as 
conscientious objection to military service civil disobedience and 
the housing of illegal aliens 
we need not agree with the specific dictates of anothers 
conscience to respect and support the right to exercise that 
conscience the paper says we are called to obey god rather 
than men

president reagan played down any disagreement 
wednesday with vice president george bush about the soviet union 
but underscored his belief that kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
definitely wants changes in the social structure there 
bush a day earlier offered a different view 
i dont agree that we know enough to say that there is that 
kind of fundamental change a turning inward a la china on the 
part of the soviet union i dont feel that way the vice 
president said tuesday he said gorbachev was stylistically 
different obviously generationally different but my view is 
the jury is still out on his intentions 
reagan was asked about the apparent difference with bush during 
a white house questionandanswer session with reporters from 
around the country 
denying he was on a different track than the vice president the 
president said i think hes being as careful as we all must 
be 
however he said gorbachev was different from other soviet 
leaders 
this doesnt mean that you lower your guard precipitiously at 
all but he definitely wants changes in the social structure 
there and hes faced with a great econmic problem there literally 
a basket case and he has plans and these plans are part of his 
plan for trying to build up the economy and make it more viable 
than it presently is reagan said 
the president also expressed eagerness to campaign against 
likely democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis he said his 
advice to bush the republican standardbearer was george wait 
until you and i get out there on the trail and start pinning him 
down on the things he claims which we know are not true 
reagan said that if he listened to dukakis enough i would be 
convinced that were in an economic downturn and that people are 
homeless and people are going without food and medical attention 
and that weve got to do something about the unemployed 
the president spoke of the economy and unemployment figures in 
glowing terms and said he would do everything i can to help 
bush win 
yes mr president good jobs and affordable housing and health 
insurance for working families are what the american dream is all 
about dukakis said in response to reagans criticism 
and we can do a lot better than weve been doing to make that 
dream come true for every citizen in the land dukakis said 
on other subjects the president 
said jesse jackson the runnerup to dukakis had impressed a 
great number of followers and i want to say without any inference 
to any racial difference or anything i would have to say i find 
myself in great disagreement with policies that he has proposed as 
well as those of the other candidate dukakis 
refused to retract his statements in moscow about american 
indians that had drawn widespread criticism back home i dont 
regret that reagan said he said there were mistakes made back 
in the very beginning of our country with regard to the indians and 
the manner of handling them 
in moscow he had said the united states had humored indians 
by putting them on reservations he also misspoke by saying indians 
were not citizens 
reacted coolly to gorbachevs proposal for a joint ussoviet 
mission to send an unmanned rocket to mars he said the american 
space program had been thrown behind in schedule by the tragedy of 
the challenger space shuttle explosion and that he had referred 
gorbachevs idea to us experts 
incidentally weve already sent a craft to mars as you know 
in the past and taken some pictures that make you wonder why 
anyone would want to go there reagan said the audience chuckled 
discussing his recent fiveday visit to the soviet union the 
president said the russian people have taken to both these 
glasnost openness and perestrokia structural reforms and have a 
far better feeling about their system i didnt run into the kind 
of cynicism that ive seen so often in the past among them 
he added i think british prime minister margaret thatcher 
was right when she said hes someone you can do business with 
as he has done several times in the past reagan suggested he 
had met with other soviet leaders although gorbachev is the first 
general secretary of the communist party with whom he has conferred 
i have known a number of their leaders and met with a number 
of their leaders before and i must say he gorbachev is 
different reagan said 
he said that gorbachev in their talks last week was very 
careful not to express any preference in the us presidential 
race

the nations highest court on wednesday ruled that 
an american archbishop and two other vatican bank officials cannot 
be prosecuted on fraud charges stemming from the collapse of 
italys biggest private bank 
the constitutional court upheld a lower court ruling that threw 
out arrest warrants against archbishop paul marcinkus president of 
the vatican bank and two other vatican bank officials 
prosecutors accused marcinkus and the two lay officials 
pellegrino de strobel and luigi mennini of being accessories to 
the fraudulent bankruptcy of banco ambrosiano 
the milanbased banco ambrosiano then italys biggest bank 
collapsed in 1982 after it was unable to collect 13 billion in 
loans made to 10 dummy companies in latin america that were 
controlled by the vatican bank 
marcinkus of cicero ill at the time headed the institute for 
religious works the vatican banks formal title 
milan authorities issued arrest warrants in february 1987 for 
marcinkus de strobel and mennini 
the constitutional court on wednesday upheld a previous ruling 
from the court of cassation the lower court threw out the arrest 
warrants because of a vaticanitaly treaty that says the vatican a 
sovereign state is not subject to interference from any italian 
authority 
the constitutional court did not address directly the 
jurisidiction issues raised by the treaty saying only that the 
cassation court had final say in the case 
the court of cassation had rejected a lower court ruling that 
the arrest warrants were legitimate because the bank failure 
occurred in italy 
the vatican bank a major shareholder of banco ambrosiano 
agreed in 1984 to pay 250 million as part of banco ambrosianos 
bankruptcy settlement but it said the payment was not an admission 
of responsibility

former san francisco mayor joseph l alioto 
was cleared provisionally wednesday of all charges by the referee 
of a state bar court trial over a 52 million legal fee in a 1975 
antitrust case 
aliotos son joseph m alioto faces charges from the case in 
which the plaintiffs beef ranchers won a 9 million settlement in 
their case against three supermarket chains the sons hearing 
continues 
the 73yearold former mayor could have faced disbarment 
suspension or probation had he been found guilty the referees 
decision is subject to approval of the bars review department bar 
spokeswoman anne charles said 
earlier wednesday before the elder alioto testified he had an 
indication of the outcome referee c thorne corse was reported to 
have told associates he was inclined to dismiss the charges against 
the senior alioto 
alioto issued a statement thanking the bar court for a just 
and fair trial which has resulted inevitably in complete 
vindication i was confident i could prove the charges were 
nothing more than vicious and baseless attacks on my reputation and 
my practice 
alioto was charged with collecting an unconscionable fee and 
acts of unethical conduct in the case brought by plaintiffs 
including wyoming beef rancher courtney davis 
the aliotos said the fee was not unconscionable because their 
clients cattle ranchers were receiving more than the 9 million 
settlement because they also would receive 20 cents a pound more 
for their beef 
the former mayor also repeatedly maintained he had nothing to do 
with the negotiation of the settlement 
alioto and his son were accused of acts moral turpitude 
dishonesty and corruption in taking a 52 million fee for 
handling the case 
alioto told corse testifying only for himself that he had been 
told over the telephone by his son a member of his firm that the 
plaintiffs had been offered 9 million 
he said he advised his son to take the money and run the 
former mayor repeated to state bar prosecutor jerome fishkin that 
although he owned the firm he had not been involved in reaching the 
settlement or the fee 
he said responsibility for matters in the business had been 
delegated while alioto ran for mayor he said he played only a 
minor role in the settlement later on because he was busy being 
mayor an office he held in the late 1960s and early 70s

sinhalese extremists seeking to 
disrupt thursdays regional elections detonated a bomb in a crowded 
market killing four people a sri lankan military official said 
the official said sinhalese radicals on wednesday also fatally 
shot a candidate for the southern district council 
authorities blamed the preelection violence on the peoples 
liberation front an ultranationalist group from sri lankas 
ethnic sinhalese majority 
district council elections were called under terms of an 
indianbrokered peace accord signed on july 29 1987 and intended 
to end a separatist war by the tamil minority the war has cost 
more then 8000 lives since 1983 
sinhalese radicals claim the pact makes too many concessions to 
tamils and have vowed to kill anyone who supports it 
a total of 166 candidates are competing for 53 seats on the 
newly created southern district council the seventh to be elected 
since april 28 
attacks by the sinhalese radical group since india and sri lanka 
signed the peace agreement have taken the lives of 24 council 
candidates and more than 300 other people including civilians and 
party workers 
the bomb wednesday exploded in the market at weligama town 75 
miles south of colombo the military official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the four people killed were sinhalese 
civilians 
he said the candidate 52yearold as dayawansa was shot to 
death while campaigning on wednesday in the southern district he 
was a member of the opposition united socialist alliance 
five deaths were reported tuesday including one candidate a 
policeman and a civilian 
other violence in the past two days included the burning of 
government buses and several courthouses 
storekeepers said sinhalese extremists told them to close 
wednesday and police said the group ordered a curfew on 
thursday to keep people from leaving their homes to vote 
sinhalese most of whom are buddhists are more than 75 percent 
of sri lankas 16 million people and tamils predominantly hindu 
make up 18 percent 
tamils claim discrimination by the sinhalese who control the 
government and army and rebels seek a separate homeland in the 
tamildominated north and east to be called eelam 
the peace agreement called for tamil rebels to lay down their 
arms in exchange for more autonomy in northern and eastern sri 
lanka but the largest insurgent group continues to fight 
india has more than 50000 troops on the island trying to end 
the rebellion it became involved because it is the regions 
dominant power and has 60 million tamils in southern tamil nadu 
state 
district council elections in the tamildominated areas have 
been delayed by the fighting but officials hope to hold them next 
month

the internal revenue service has backed away 
from its interpretation of a part of tax law that could have made 
deferred benefits such as the vacation pay and sick time of public 
and nonprofit employees taxable according to a treasury 
department letter released wednesday 
o donaldson chapoton assistant secretary for tax policy said 
in the letter that bona fide vacation leave sick leave 
compensatory time severance pay disability pay and death benefits 
will not be taxable under section 457 of the tax code 
i am very happy that the irs has decided to drop its unfair 
interpretation of section 457 of the tax code said rep raymond 
mcgrath rny at a news conference 
this is certainly good news for the public employees of the 
states mcgrath said it is certainly good news for the 
taxexempt employees it signifies that the irs will not be 
picking the pockets of these employees 
mcgrath estimated that the some 14 million state and local 
employees nationwide would have been affected as well as untold 
numbers of workers in nonprofit organizations 
the president of the 11 million member american federation of 
state county and municipal employees the nations largest public 
employee union applauded the decision 
gerald w mcentee said in a statement that he was happy and 
relieved that the internal revenue service has backed away from its 
plan to start taxing hardwon fringe benefits 
in january 1987 the irs issued a public notice that section 457 
which provides rules for certain types of deferred compensation 
for employees of state and local governments and taxexempt 
organizations would be interpreted to apply to nonelective 
deferred compensation 
nonprofit employee organizations and public employee unions 
fearing the rule would have applied to benefits that were never 
taken deluged legislators with petitions asking for help in 
changing the rule 
the irs change came one day after sen daniel p moynihan 
dny introduced legislation to rescind the measure 
moynihan had measured praise for the irs decision but said 
some problems remain such as what constitutes bona fide 
compensation and how deferred cash compensation will be handled 
i will discuss the matter with treasury and with public 
employee and taxexempt employee groups and pursue legislative 
relief to the extent problems remain he said in a statement 
mcgrath who is a cosponsor of a similar bill in the house 
credited vice president george bush for assisting in the debate 
between congress and the irs on the issue 
i called the vice president to explain the concerns of 
millions of union members and elected officials from new york and 
other states mcgrath said he contacted treasury secretary 
james baker who had the irs reconsider its position 
but both moynihan and mcgrath admitted neither bill has a great 
chance of passing this year because there will be no appropriate 
legislative vehicle such as a tax bill to which their bill could 
be attached 
the irs will formally announce its decision in the next week 
according to chapotons letter

federal authorities are investigating air traffic 
controllers at ohare international airport after they made three 
mistakes in two days this week including one that led to a 
nearmiss officials said wednesday 
the significant increase in operational errors from 12 in all 
of last year to 20 already this year set off concern for us 
said mike benson a spokesman for the national transportation 
safety board in washington 
ohare is the worlds busiest airport in terms of takeoffs and 
landings 
benson said four investigators would arrive in chicago possibly 
by thursday and focus on ohares radar room where most of the 
mistakes have been made 
the radar room routes air traffic in a 30mile radius of ohare 
while controllers in the tower primarily direct takeoffs and 
landings he said 
radar controllers have been responsible for 15 of the 20 
mistakes including the three earlier this week benson said last 
year they made nine of the airports 12 errors 
on monday a united airlines boeing 727 carrying 128 passengers 
to ontario calif came within 1200 feet of a lear jet after 
takeoff said dan sheehy a united spokesman 
the pilot of the lear jet filed a nearmidair collision report 
said federal aviation administration spokesman mort edelstein 
united did not file a report because it and the faa consider a 
nearcollision to be when two aircraft come within 500 feet of each 
other sheehy said the united pilot did not need to take any 
evasive action but the company is investigating the incident he 
said 
later monday a united 727 bound for washington flew near a 
cessna 172 shortly after takeoff sheehy and benson said 
the captain did take evasive action but the separation was 
3000 feet sheehy said 
the third error involved an american airlines dc10 and a midway 
airlines boeing 737 on tuesday benson said but he could provide 
no other details 
the investigators will interview a crosssection of controllers 
including those involved in the errors and examine things such as 
training quality assurance and amount of overtime worked 
the national air traffic controllers association based in 
washington said controllers at ohare and other airports 
nationwide are overworked 
we would welcome any type of outside oversight right now

the west coast teamed up with the east bloc on 
wednesday when the soviet unions largest film studio and a small 
hollywood company formed the first ussoviet joint movie venture 
mosfilm the soviet unions largest filmworks signed a 
longterm contract with fresfilm to produce several movies 
beginning with a portrayal of napoleons invasion of russia in 1812 
soviet director sergei solovyev described the agreement as a 
realistic first step toward cultural cooperation following the 
summit in moscow last week between president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev 
the first film rendezvous with bonaparte will be a 
russian romance with political overtones said solovyev 
tom meehan president of fresfilm described the agreement as a 
foot in the soviet door for his small studio 
although us and soviet studios have cooperated in previous 
films such as bluebird with elizabeth taylor in the 1970s 
this deal is the first signed under a joint venture law 
the law which took effect last year allows foreign firms to 
own a stake of up to 49 percent in a company 
everyone in hollywood wanted to be the first to be to sign a 
contract in the soviet union said meehan a cigarchomping 
resident of fresno calif 
rendezvous with bonaparte will be filmed in the soviet 
union poland and france and distributed in the englishspeaking 
world by fresfilm mosfilm will have distribution rights in the 
east bloc and rights to distribute elsewhere will be negotiated 
later 
under the agreement signed wednesday fresfilm will supply film 
and rent cameras lights and other advanced cinematographic 
equipment to mosfilm for scenes filmed in the soviet union and 
poland said meehan 
mosfilm has agreed to provide 2 million rubles or 34 million 
making rendezvous with napoleon the most expensive movie in its 
budget this year solovyev said 
well get everything we need to make the film he said 
the film will be based on a novel by bulat okuzhava a beloved 
soviet lyric poet and bard 
one of the aims of napoleon invading russia was to bring 
freedom to the russian people to introduce the ideas of the 1789 
french revolution and topple the czar said solovyev 
but when he tried to do so by force the russian people rose 
up and defeated him however his ideas remained said solovyev

the state attorney general asked a federal appeals 
court wednesday to overturn a rule that could ease the licensing of 
the controversial seabrook nuclear power plant over the objections 
of massachusetts officials 
attorney general james shannon argued that the rule which lets 
utilities draw up their own emergency evacuation plans when states 
refuse to cooperate poses a great risk to the safety of the 
citizens of massachusetts 
shannon contended that the nuclear regulatory commission adopted 
the rule precisely to bypass state officials opposition to opening 
of the plant in seabrook nh 
william briggs attorney for the nrc said the regulation 
balances the interests of utility companies and public safety 
last year the nrc adopted the rule allowing the commission to 
consider evacuation plans drafted by nuclear plant owners if state 
and local authorities refuse to offer their own proposals 
the rule presumes that state and local officials will follow the 
utilitys plan in case of an actual emergency 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis so far has thwarted the 
licensing of seabrook a completed but still idle reactor two miles 
north of the massachusetts border 
dukakis maintains that no emergency evacuation plan can 
safeguard residents of six coastal massachusetts towns within 10 
miles of seabrook 
the three judges on the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
questioned attorneys on both sides but gave no indication of how 
and when they might rule 
during arguments appellate judge raymond acosta questioned 
briggs about the wisdom of yielding emergency planning duties to 
utilities it seems to me its a little like the fox guarding the 
henhouse acosta said 
but whos the fox briggs countered 
lets face it these are moneymaking operations the judge 
said referring to the utilities 
shannon argued that the nrcs own regulations require 
reasonable assurance of adequate protective measures for 
the public in case of a nuclear accident 
that standard requires the cooperation of state and local 
authorities in handling traffic fire and rescue operations he 
said 
the nrc unreasonably presumes that states will cooperate in an 
actual disaster shannon said but he insisted that massachusetts 
could not and would not cooperate 
the attorney general also argued that the new regulation entails 
an impermissible delegation of the governors public safety 
duties 
briggs said the nrc acted within its powers in approving the 
regulation he contended that shannons position would give states 
a veto power over nuclear licensing decisions usurping a 
responsibility congress has given to the nrc 
he also said the nrc has never lessened the public safety 
standard that evacuation plans must meet 
shannon was supported by attorney karla letsche representing 
the state of new york gov mario cuomo and new yorks suffolk 
county as well as ellen weiss representing the union of concerned 
scientists 
cuomo prevented new york officials from participating in 
emergency planning for the shoreham plant on long island and 
steered an agreement between the state and long island lighting co 
two weeks ago that will prevent the 53 billion plant from ever 
generating salable power 
meanwhile selectmen in groton mass voted monday to stop 
paying their share of the seabrook plant saying it looks unlikely 
they will ever see power from it 
gary l hunt general manager of massachusetts municipal 
wholesale electric co which made the investment for the town 
called the vote horribly irresponsible 
mmwec last week decided to stop paying its share of the 
maintenance of seabrook but to continue to pay interest on its 
share of the plants debt the groton selectman voted to stop all 
payments including debt interest

president mohammed zia ulhaq of pakistan has 
canceled a visit to the united states scheduled for next week 
informed sources said wednesday 
the trip was to include talks with president reagan and a speech 
to the un disarmament conference in new york 
questions were raised last month about whether zia would make 
the visit after he dismissed the pakistan government headed by 
prime minister mohammed khan junejo 
zia on may 30 accused the junejo cabinet of incompetence and 
corruption and of failing to maintain law and order he then called 
for new elections for the national assembly within 90 days acting 
under a provision of the pakistani constitution 
the pakistan embassy said it would have no information until 
ambassador jamsheed marker returned from islamabad where he had 
gone to make preparations for t he visit 
plans for the washington leg of zias visit had remained 
tentative and had not been confirmed according to a us source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
earlier zia actions had been praised by us officials for 
progress toward restoring democracy in the south asian moslem 
country the 64yearold army general had seized power in a 1977 
bloodless coup and appointed junejo prime minister in march 1985 
after national elections he later ended martial law 
but dismissal of the junejo government prompted the state 
department on may 31 to say it hoped that the required elections 
would be held promptly and that they would be free and fair later 
reports from islamabad told of growing doubt in the pakistan 
capital about prospects for prompt elections

the veterans peace convoy of food and 
medical supplies for nicaragua was stopped short of the border 
wednesday by officials who said the mission violates restrictions 
on trade with the central american nation 
about 100 members of the convoy that started from four us 
cities on may 21 said they would stay in this border city until the 
us government allows the caravan to cross the border 
the group camped tuesday night in laredo and planned to cross 
the border wednesday morning with about 40 tons of supplies us 
customs officials though told them the supplies could cross but 
the vehicles could not 
us customs officials said they were told by the foreign assets 
control of the treasury department to enforce nicaraguan trade 
regulations at the border 
the treasury department has reason to believe that the 
veterans peace convoy intends to leave its convoy trucks in 
nicaragua as a donation to certain groups in that country 
according to a treasury department statement 
the restrictions prohibit the unlicensed export of goods from 
the united states to nicaragua but do not prohibit donated 
articles such as food clothing and medicine intended to be used 
to relieve human suffering 
treasury officials contend that taking trucks to nicaragua would 
violate the trade embargo and told the convoy it would have to 
post bonds totaling the value of all of the vehicles 
it is a very usual ordinary and customary procedure said 
charles conroy a customs spokesman 
we on our own met with them last night tuesday to try to 
advise them of some requirements of the us government including 
customs and other agencies said james purser chief inspector of 
us customs in laredo 
in addition to the bonds which the group says would total more 
than 100000 the vehicles would have to be returned to the united 
states within 30 days 
this effectively stops the passage of our convoy for the 
moment said gerry condon of santa cruz calif and a member of 
the convoys steering committee we are not prepared to post the 
bonds 
about 150 tons of food concentrated milk for children diapers 
hospital beds toys and bicycles have been collected from churches 
hospitals and citizens for the trip to nicaragua 
some of the aid was planned to be shipped later to be turned 
over to representatives of humanitarian agencies in nicaragua 
bob livesey of dorchester mass a convoy organizer said 
tuesday that the convoy had been in 20 states since leaving maine 
on may 21 the convoy reached laredo after leaving austin on 
tuesday 
it had been scheduled to reach nicaragua june 18 
this convinces us that they are engaged in selective 
enforcement against us because of who we are veterans and because 
of the message we are carrying said stephen somerstein a 
brooklyn ny lawyer with the convoy 
members of the convoy said the trip and its publicity would 
highlight their opposition to the reagan administrations trade 
embargo on nicaragua and its support of the antigovernment rebels 
known as contras 
somerstein said attorneys with the new yorkbased center for 
constitutional rights are representing the convoy in negotiations 
with the treasury department and that some type of legal action is 
being contemplated

total independence of angola known as unita about 45000 cuban 
soldiers support the marxist government

negotiations aimed at resolving angolas 13yearold civil war and 
bringing independence to namibia 
peace talks involving south africa cuba angola and the united 
states were held may 34 in london south african and angolan 
delgations met may 13 in brazzaville congo a possible third round 
of talks is in limbo because of a dispute over the meeting site 
the south african callup involves units of the citizen force a 
branch of the army made up of white men who have completed thir 
obligatory two years in the military and take part in annual 
training camps subject to mobilization 
geldenhuys gave no details of the mobilization 
he said a press report that 11000 cubans were in southern 
angola might be a useful rough calculation 
we have the forces to handle the situation although the 
situation is serious he said the point is how does it affect 
the negotiations

a house subcommittee is investigating 
allegations that justice department officials improperly quashed a 
criminal indictment of the wife of syndicated columnist george 
will a source said wednesday 
wusatv which reported on the congressional investigation said 
former us attorney joseph digenova intervened to stop the 
indictment overruling the strong recommendation of his assistant 
prosecutors 
the case involved madeline will an assistant secretary of 
education and wife of the conservative columnist who is a close 
friend of nancy reagan and was a campaign debate coach for 
president reagan 
the case concerned the submission of false travel vouchers 
wrongful use of a government limousine and driver and keeping an 
employee on the government payroll for months after the employee 
stopped working 
digenova reached at home wednesday by the associated press 
said the report that he stopped an indictment of mrs will was 
totally inaccurate and that he acted only after receiving the 
consensus of career nonpolitically appointed prosecutors in the 
department 
there was disagreement as to how the case should be handled 
said digenova who left the us attorneys job march 1 to join a 
private law firm rather than make the decision personally i 
referred back to them for a group decision that group recommended 
to me that it not be handled criminally but that it be referred to 
the civil division for civil action he said the reason for that 
decision was insufficient evidence against mrs will he said 
neither mrs will nor her husband could be reached for comment 
wednesday evening 
the house subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental 
relations is looking into several investigative cases at the 
department of education that also involve the justice department 
a spokesman for the panel told the associated press speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
a source said the hearing june 23 would include the madeline 
will case 
in 1986 the education departments inspector generals office 
found that mrs will submitted false travel vouchers for 
reimbursement she said it was her secretarys fault wusa reported 
investigators also found that she used a government limousine 
and driver to take her to a local beauty salon and repeated lunches 
at a capitol hill restaurant the tv station reported 
mrs will denied the allegations but admitted keeping an 
employee on the federal payroll for nearly four months even though 
the employee did not come to work wusa said 
investigators referred the case to the us attorneys office 
for criminal prosecution on june 10 1986 chief prosecutor 
william block recommended that mrs will be prosecuted the station 
reported 
but digenova said wednesday that block was part of the group of 
prosecutors that recommended to him that the case be turned over to 
the civil division mr block came back with the group and 
they recommended to me that it not be handled criminally but that 
it be handled civilly 
mrs will was never indicted and remains an assistant secretary 
of education she did repay the treasury department the 12022 
paid to her missing employee from the settlement resulting from the 
civil proceedings according to department records 
an attorney who worked on the case but who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity said the thought that this was a cover up 
or that digenova overruled a decision to prosecute is absolutely 
absurd

a navy recruit described as being 
literally scared to death when allegedly forced back into a rescue 
training pool died by accident because the system broke down 
defense lawyers argued wednesday 
a prosecutor however contended that forcing airman recruit lee 
mirecki into the pool when he tried to quit the rescue course at 
pensacola naval air station couldnt be blamed on the system but 
was a crime committed by people 
the use of force to make people do things is not allowed by 
the uniform code of military justice said lt cmdr larry d 
wynne 
the arguments closed a hearing into the march 2 death of the 
19yearold recruit from appleton wis at the pensacola naval air 
station 
evidence in four days of testimony will be used by cmdr daniel 
j dalesio jr the investigating officer to make a 
recommendation to rear adm david morris chief of naval air 
training in corpus christi texas 
morris has 120 days from the may 10 filing of the formal 
complaint to decide whether any punishment is warranted 
recommendations can include courtmartial proceedings nonjudicial 
punishment or dismissal of the charges 
charged with involuntary manslaughter are petty officers 1st 
class richard e blevins and david j smith and petty officers 2nd 
class frankie d deaton john w zelenock and michael w combe all 
instructors at the rescue swimmer school 
lt thomas a torchia the officer in charge of the school is 
accused of dereliction of duty 
witnesses testified mirecki tried to quit training a month 
before he died and was subsequently classified by a flight suregon 
as unfit to continue training because he had a phobia about being 
dragged under water 
a clinical psychologist disagreed with the finding and mirecki 
was returned to training through a series of errors without 
obtaining a required physical examination and approval by a flight 
surgeon witnesses said 
there was clearly a breakdown in the system argued lt 
steven h cohen lawyer for blevins the system broke down it 
failed airman recruit mirecki 
it was a tragic accident said retired navy capt ferdinand 
salomon who represented torchia 
mireckis sister lynn johansen also of appleton and his 
mother elaine kitowski of manitowish wis attended the hearing 
they declined comment but issued a statement 
we hope the information brought forth in this hearing will 
bring about changes in the naval system to prevent this from ever 
happening again it said in part 
testimony indicated mirecki became frightened during a drill 
left the pool and held on to an equipment rack before a group of 
instructors pried him loose and forced him back into the water 
he then was taken back to the deep end in a headhold by combe 
according to testimony there was conflicting evidence whether 
mirecki collapsed while in combes hold or broke free and put combe 
in a rescue hold successfully completing the drill before he 
collapsed 
prosecutor wynne derided the latter version as a bmovie 
scenario concocted by the defense 
it is unlikely anybody being frightened to death would have 
the calm sense of the moment to perform a maneuver he had been 
unable to do since the beginning of the drill wynne argued 
the defense contended that physical contact was part of the 
rigorous course and that it was not unusual for frightened scared 
or malingering students to be physically forced back into the pool 
or pulled off its walls to resume drills 
the navy trained them in that fashion said lt david s 
yandle the defense lawyer for zelenock the navy trained them to 
train in that fashion and the navy told them their instruction 
techniques were good

pan am corps board of directors has authorized 
the ailing airlines management to sell most of pan ams assets if 
agreements on labor concessions are not reached with its unions 
the company also said it would reduce its flight operations more 
than normal after the peak summer travel season 
financial analysts and union leaders characterized the move as 
negotiating pressure but said they also took the threat seriously 
in many respects its a warning shot to the unions said 
john pincavage an airline analyst at the securities firm 
painewebber inc 
the boards decision also could be a sort of trial balloon to 
see what sort of offers emerge for pan ams assets he suggested 
in a letter sent tuesday night to pan am employees chairman 
thomas g plaskett said management was frustrated at not being able 
to get concessions from three of the companys five major unions 
unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed in 
january to wage cuts and work rule changes that are to save pan am 
240 million over three years but analysts have estimated the 
airline needs to save around 540 million in that period to ensure 
its financial recovery 
the flight attendants teamsters and transport workers unions 
have fought taking pay cuts 
the boards decision authorizes the sale of any of the assets of 
pan american world airways the companys flagship carrier 
without limitation including route segments and divisions 
maintenance and terminal facilities aircraft engines and other 
equipment plasketts letter said 
the only pan am assets which could not be sold are its lucrative 
northeast shuttle service and pan am world services which provides 
ground services to other carriers in airports around the world 
plaskett told employees that as a first step in its new plan 
pan am will substantially reduce the level of its flight 
operations in the fourth quarter far beyond the normal seasonal 
reduction following the summer peak 
pan am also will close its flight service base in san francisco 
on oct 1 and will return two 747 aircraft to their lessors when 
their leases expire at the end of the summer he said 
if agreement is reached with the dissenting unions representing 
flight attendants teamsters and transport workers the assets 
might not be sold pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said wednesday 
we can continue along the path of an orderly sale of assets or 
we can find ourselves with a labor agreement soon she said 
there is a very good possibility that the plan to sell assets of 
the company would not go forward 
the company has no specific timetable for selling the assets 
she said 
im taking the letter at face value i presume that theyre 
serious about selling assets said margaret brennan head of the 
flight attendants union at pan am who also heads the joint labor 
council representing the five big unions there 
brennan said the authorization to sell assets could be a tactic 
to pressure recalcitrant unions she cautioned however that i 
dont think theyre going to accomplish anything with the flight 
attendants like this 
pan ams plan to sell assets is a negotiating tactic because 
theyre just fed up with the unions said julius maldutis who 
follows the industry for the investment firm salomon brothers inc 
there are some great risks associated with this strategy but 
pan am had no choice 
among those risks he said are that potential passengers could 
be scared away from pan am flights because of the impending sales 
and that many frequent fliers on the airline could stampede to cash 
in their travel awards 
pan am the nations eighthlargest airline had a net loss of 
833 million in the first quarter the unions representing pilots 
and flight engineers have agreed to concessions totaling about 240 
million over three years but analysts and airline sources believe 
pan am needs around 540 million over the period

scores of men women and children raced 
into the headquarters of the latin american bishops conference in 
bogota on wednesday and occupied the building saying they were 
protesting violence in colombia 
a communique issued by the protesters said they called 
themselves christians for peace 
an anonymous caller claiming to be one of the protesters told 
the associated press a priest and a nun were being held hostage 
until the demonstrators got to talk with a government 
representative 
he said there were 100 protesters including 10 children in the 
threestory building in northern bogota 
police surrounded the structure minutes after the protesters 
some with scarves wrapped around their faces stormed inside 
the caller said the protest was against rightwing death squads 
blamed for killing more than 800 persons in colombia in the last 
three years 
the communique said we want to call attention to the 
situation of violence that exists in colombia it asked the 
church to intervene effectively in the mediation of the conflict 
without specifying which conflict 
the roman catholic church in colombia has repeatedly offered to 
mediate between the government and leftist guerrillas but no rebel 
group has agreed

in the mazelike refugee camps of 
pakistans northwestern frontier turbaned afghans clad in the 
pajamalike salwar kameez congregate everywhere women are 
noticeably absent 
the frontier province which now is home for most of the 35 
million refugees of the afghan war is a mirror image of more than 
half of afghanistans population 
ethnically the people of the frontier are of the pashtoon 
tribes more than 60 percent of afghans also are pashtoons but the 
tribes are split by the afghanpakistan border the pashtoon code 
of honor that demands family honor and religion be defended to the 
death has played a major role in the afghans tenacity in their 
10year war 
the ethnic minorities are many 
the largest of these are the hazaras who live in hazarajat in 
north central afghanistan and the tajiks uzbeks and turkomans 
who live toward the north along afghanistans border with the 
soviet union along the northeastern border with pakistan live the 
fairhaired lightskinned nuristanis who claim to be descendents 
of deserters of alexander the greats army 
for the most part afghans are farmers tilling small holdings 
near their villages the grueling heat of pakistan contrasts 
sharply to the fertile valleys and enticingly cool mountains of

afghan war refugees haunted by 
loneliness and memories of their bombed villages their spouses or 
children killed sit for hours in the sunbaked mud homes of their 
camps in pakistan 
the majority of the 35 million afghan refugees are children 
with women making up the next largest group 
shrouded behind a veil or hidden behind high mud walls women 
are a society unto themselves transplanted from their villages 
where they openly tended their fields to crowded camps surrounded 
by strangers afghan women have been forced into seclusion 
dr mohammad azam dadfar who runs a psychiatric center for 
afghans in peshawar said the exile forced on the refugees has left 
millions with psychological wounds 
if the refugees returned tomorrow to afghanistan the effect 
would continue for years there is a generation of psychologically 
mutilated afghans said dadfar they are the children 
maryam was 9 years old when jets screamed over her village in 
baghland province and dumped their payload for three days she was 
buried in the rubble of her home her family was dead afghan 
guerrillas found her and brought her to pakistan 
in the summer the refugee camps are treeless parched 
dustbowls in the winter cold damp prisons the mortality rate 
among children is high 
everyday they see their playmates die dadfar said

for author and journalist david grossman the 
problem at the root of the israelipalestinian conflict can be felt 
in the chance encounters of arabs and jews on any jerusalem street 
when i see a palestinian or a group of palestinians 
approaching me theres a special look that we have developed us 
and them a hollow look a white look grossman said we see 
through them and they see through us i think because its such a 
wound for both of us such a pain 
the 34yearold israeli novelist broke through the hollow looks 
early last year by spending seven weeks on the west bank 
interviewing mostly palestinians he wrote a series of articles 
detailing their sense of unjust persecution the articles have been 
expanded into a book the yellow wind 
the articles forced readers to look deep into the eyes of those 
living under the israeli military occupation that started after the 
1967 arabisraeli war 
there is naima a little girl of about 4 with green eyes what 
do soldiers do grossman asks 
naima replies searches and beatings 
grossman do you know who the jews are 
naima the army 
grossman are there other jews 
naima no 
there is mohammed alkalilah whose house was knocked down 
after his estranged son took part in the murder of two jewish 
couples the son was killed and the father has become a beggar 
if my son murdered kill him kill him immediately the man 
said but why have you destroyed my entire life 
there is another elderly villager named abu harb who tells 
grossman about the yellow wind the wind comes from the gates of 
hell and sets the world on fire abu harb says exterminating all 
those who have performed cruel or unjust deeds 
the book was translated into arabic by the israeli arab poet 
mahmoud darwish and distributed to the leaders of the palestine 
liberation organization it was excerpted in the new yorker in 
january 
the author who is the anchor of israel radios morning news 
show said the shock the book created in israel was a surprise to 
him he did not realize how much israelis had distanced themselves 
from the 15 million palestinians they rule 
people were caught unprepared he said in an interview i 
think in a way it gave words to people who lacked words 
the frustration among palestinians under military occupation 
gave many observers the sense that the west bank was a steam pipe 
gathering the kind of pressure that eventually blows off a manhole 
cover 
grossman said he felt it but like most israelis he did not 
expect last decembers explosion much less a solid six months of 
demonstrations for another decade 
people were really frightened he said suddenly these 
palestinians who we had always treated as kids suddenly they were 
redefining themselves without asking us they are adults and they 
are starting to fight back 
grossman rejected an offer from koteret rashit the israeli 
magazine that first published the articles to go back to the west 
bank to do a sequel to the book during the current uprising which 
has left at least 200 palestinians and two israelis dead 
israel is not at a time to be influenced by words the 
situation is so brutal said the author whose novel see under 
love is scheduled for release in the united states next february 
it is a time for politicians not for writers 
grossman is critical of the entrenchment among israels right 
wing led by prime minister yitzhak shamir in moving to expel 
moderate palestinians leaders such as nonviolent advocate mubarak 
awad the government is choosing the language of force over 
dialogue he said 
there are still enough elements in israel that are afraid of 
using this turning point as a lever to salvage the situation to 
give it a new definition he said i think politicians should 
not be led by fears israel suffered during the last 40 years some 
very severe dangers but to make our fears an ideology is a very 
bad choice 
he thinks the 1979 peace treaty between egypt and israel was a 
lost chance to give the palestinians a home of their own and 
thinks that such a homeland and guaranteed security for israel 
could emerge from the current demonstrations 
we now see them only in their fury but i know behind their 
mask of hatred there are people like me and you although jews 
dont like this comparison he said there is a great part of 
the population that is starting to want to live a normal life

greek orthodox archbishop iakovos has denounced 
an attack on the religious status of democratic presidential 
contender michael dukakis saying he always has embraced the church 
the greek orthodox community also is proud of him iakovos said 
noting that if dukakis wins the presidency he would be first 
member of that faith ever to fill the office 
at one time only wasps could run the archbishop said 
white anglosaxon protestants have held the presidency except for 
1961 to 1963 when john f kennedy a roman catholic was in the 
white house 
it would be fitting to include a greek orthodox iakovos said in 
an interview we have learned to respect one another as is proper 
for coexistence in our multicultural multinational society 
religious belief is not one of the criteria for being elected 
president of the united states 
dukakis is scheduled to address greek orthodoxys biennial 
clergylaity congress july 38 in boston where about 3000 
delegates and guests are expected to give him a brotherly 
typically festive greek reception 
we are proud that one of our young men has had the courage and 
determination to run for the highest office in the nation 
iakovos said adding that hes offering no formal endorsement 
something the church avoids 
the whitehaired 76yearold archbishop noting that dukakis 
calls him his spiritual father said i put it that 99 
percent of us are very proud dukakis is a frontrunner and almost 
certain nominee 
vice president george bush the republican presidential 
candidate and an episcopalian also is to address the orthodox 
gathering 
iakovos leader for 29 years of americas 2 million greek 
orthodox sharply repudiated an attack on dukakis faith by james 
jatras a church layman and staff member of the senate republican 
policy committee 
in widely distributed letters jatras said dukakis defames the 
church by some of his positions and is a an apostate 
renegade and outcast for his marriage to a jewish woman 
the attack is wrong in itself iakovos said calling it 
extremely unjustified and the fanatic work of small 
people 
dukakis is a member of the church was baptized in it and he 
has never left it he has embraced it all these years this is 
not something new many times he has said i was his spiritual 
father he said 
iakovos has maintained a longtime warm relationship with 
dukakis and his parents encouraging him in his bids for the 
massachusetts governorship and more recently in seeking the 
presidency 
the two still meet and talk occasionally such as on april 14 
when dukakis visited the churchs manhattan headquarters and took 
part in vespers services later chatting with iakovos in his office 
he has a good head on his shoulders the archbishop said 
hes very learned he is moderate not a man of extremes 
while his marriage to a nonchristian technically bars him from 
receiving communion iakovos emphasized he remains a church member 
he is not excluded hes not the only one who has married outside 
the church 
in fact he said about 70 percent of orthodox marriages are 
with those of other denominations and increasingly with jews 
its happening more and more now he said i have a 
pastoral obligation to all our people to strengthen and encourage 
them a religious leader cannot ignore that obligation to all 
members of the faith 
in a new book faith for a lifetime published by doubleday 
iakovos offers his reflections on faith and life 
jatras letter mailed widely to bishops and others also 
accused dukakis of condoning murder and communism by upholding the 
law allowing abortion and for opposing aid to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
iakovos said i find it extremely unjustified to make such 
statements while the church condemns abortion he said that 
political leaders must uphold the law this is something that 
some clergy and others do not understand the president is 
president of all citizens believers and nonbelievers as well 
any transgression across the border betrween state and church 
is at the expense of the unity of the nation

church historian bill j leonard says 
southern baptist churches increasingly are assigning more power to 
the clergy leading to a clergification of the denomination 
leonard of southern baptist theological seminary said the 
trend toward autocratic leadership by pastors often threatens to 
degrade the status of lay people it makes the laity secondclass 
citizens it undermines the most basic biblical understanding of 
the church as the whole people of god 
he said the clergy leadership style is becoming similar to a 
chief executive officer of a corporation and is more publicly 
visible in socalled superchurches but is also quite prevalent in 
smaller churches

unlike some roman catholic dioceses that have 
closed down services sponsored by the homosexual group dignity 
the chicago archdiocese simply has taken over the sponsorship 
in doing so cardinal joseph l bernardin said he was 
concerned that gay and lesbian catholics receive the pastoral 
care of their church and to make sure the churchs teaching on 
human sexuality is presented clearly 
officers of dignity which opposes the churchs condemnation of 
homosexual activity welcomed the move as providing an official 
church ministry to homosexuals 
bernardin said the groups questioning of church teachings made 
it inappropriate for the group to continue sponsoring a mass at st 
sebastian parish so sponsorship was being assumed by the 
archdiocese 
a l986 vatican document prohibited use of church facilities to 
groups opposed to church teachings and several dioceses had simply 
shut down dignitysponsored services

the hottest shows in reruns paramount studios has so far made four 
hit star trek movies and the current star trek the next 
generation has become a hit in syndication 
it still amazes me that star trek has become a popular 
myth said roddenberry i constantly tell myself that im the 
same guy i was when i was trying to get a script assignment you 
cant believe the press clippings i think i do good work every 
once in a while i do something thats very good but id hate 
myself if i believed all the stuff written about me 
roddenberry said that when paramount asked him to create a 
television series he asked wholl be my censor if we dont go 
network 
he said when they told me id be my own censor my ears 
perked up i never thought i would ever say anything good about a 
studio but i dont get any calls about stories of course the 
other side is that you dont want to blow it so you end up working 
even harder 
i think if ive done anything well its that i picked good 
people gave them their head and didnt subject them to any 
criticism i wouldnt want myself 
he said when he created the new tv show he wanted new 
characters the actors i was working with were too good for 
handmedown characters he said 
is he satisfied with the success of the new show 
im never satisfied with any show ive produced he replied 
you always look at it and say why didnt i do that but in a 
sense i am better satisfied i have more money to produce the show 
the first year of star trek on nbc i had a budget of 184000 per 
episode that was 20000 less than mission impossible was 
getting 
but you dont get money for unsuccessful shows the critics 
hit us when we first came out the ratings were very low i said 
everyones against us so why dont we show em we cheated on 
the budget every way we could we even had our costumes made by 
people living around the studio 
the star trek adventure allows 29 members of the studio 
audience to dress up in costumes and play various roles on stage 
the performances will be taped mixed with footage from star 
trek movies and computerized equipment will produce 8minute 
videocassettes that cost 35 
there will be a new show new performers and new videocassettes 
every 30 minutes the show was produced by phil hetterma who also 
produced last years new universal attraction miami vice 
universal also plans new attractions based on the movies back

for those mutual fund investors who were brave 
enough to be aggressive in the wake of last years stock market 
crash risktaking has had its rewards to date 
in the first quarter of this year maximum capital gains 
funds tracked by the wiesenberger mutual funds investment report 
posted a 92 percent gain 
the managers of these funds pulled off the elusive feat of 
outperforming the overall market as measured by standard amp poors 
500stock composite index in the januarymarch period the sampp 500 
was up 57 percent 
does this mean that people who took last falls market collapse 
as a lesson in the hazards of speculation are missing out on a good 
thing 
not necessarily but with the stock market having perked up a 
bit again since the end of may the time may be opportune to take a 
fresh look at the class of mutual funds that take the biggest risks 
in hopes of achieving dramatic returns 
such funds are known by several names in addition to maximum 
capital gains they are often described as aggressive growth 
or capital appreciation funds 
in the 1960s recalls sheldon jacobs in his handbook for 
noload fund investors such funds were called gogo a term 
that fell into disrepute after the 197474 stock market debacle 
when the gogos wentwent 
by any name these funds resemble freeswinging sluggers in 
baseball they go for home runs and they also tend to strike out a 
lot their dividend yields are usually meager at best 
rather than blue chips these funds are prone to investing in 
smaller companies with bright promise or turnaround stocks of 
troubled companies whose days of prominence may be far in the 
future or never come at all 
over long periods of time however the best of the aggressive 
growth funds have produced some spectacular results by jacobs 
reckoning 10000 invested in the fidelity magellan fund in 
january 1975 would have grown to 334150 by december 1987 
to experience that kind of prosperity in the real world of 
course your timing has to be pretty good as it turned out 
january 1975 was an ideal occasion to be making stock investments 
but it was hard to see that then with the market having fallen 
drastically the economy in recession and the nation still nursing 
the wounds of watergate and an energy crisis 
it is impossible to say whether similar opportunities exist now 
while analysts at standard amp poors corp have recently published a 
list of recommended aggressive growth funds in the firms weekly 
publication the outlook they arent urging any headlong rush to 
buy them 
while our favorites in this category are expected to produce 
worthwhile capital gains over a period of years they said it 
would probably be wise to defer new purchases until the investment 
climate improves 
questions of timing aside who should consider aggressive growth 
funds and who should avoid them 
john laporte president of the t rowe price new horizons fund 
which invests in small growth companies put it candidly in a 
recent comment 
to participate in this sector you have to be a longterm 
investor be tolerant of volatility and be able to accept the risk 
of extended periods of underperformance 
investors who fit that description might consider having 
onethird to onehalf of their equity investments in the emerging 
growth area because these stocks have consistently done better 
than the general market over long periods of time my guess is that 
this will continue in the future

in march 1986 nguyen thi 
xuansac sent her 15yearold daughter on a boat to thailand four 
months later she sent another daughter then 11 years old on the 
same journey 
mrs xuansac knew it was risky thousands of other vietnamese 
boat people including her own sister in 1981 have been lost at 
sea or attacked by pirates 
but she sent the girls off anyway in the hope they would 
eventually find new homes in the united states 
the girls reached thailand safely and now live outside 
washington dc in lanham md 
i felt that if i died there would be no one to take care of 
my daughters said mrs xuansac whose husband fled vietnam in 
1976 and vietnam is very poor and my daughters could not study 
i want them to be happy 
mrs xuansac now is a refugee herself in thailand and wants to 
join her daughters in maryland 
her situation is similar to that of many other vietnamese and 
indochinese parents who have sent their children on the risky 
voyages across the gulf of thailand in hopes they will find new 
lives in the west 
except for the united states however western nations are 
reluctant to take the children 
international aid officials are at odds among themselves over 
the practice of parents sending their children away 
some see it as cruel but others say what must be taken into 
account is the vietnamese value system that the future of offspring 
is extremely important 
since the 1975 communist victories in their homelands more than 
10000 vietnamese laotian and cambodian children under 18 years 
old have made their way to united nationsaided camps in thailand 
without parents or adult guardians more than 1000 of these 
unaccompanied minors remain in this camp near bangkok 
thailands capital an unknown number are among about 400000 
indochinese in other thai camps 
resettlement nations that refuse to accept the unaccompanied 
children do so partly in the belief the parents send them off as a 
precursor to their own expatriation and resettlement 
international refugee officials call the practice an abuse of 
international humanitarianism 
australia for example maintains that resettling minors only 
encourages separation of families and countries should try to end 
the exodus 
mrs xuansac said in an interview life had been difficult since 
the communists in 1975 closed the company where she worked and 
ordered her family to toil on the land she said she lost contact 
with her husband after he fled in 1976 and knows only that he is 
living somewhere in the united states 
she said she never intended to follow her daughters but then 
couldnt bear the separation and made her way to phanat nikhom and 
now wants to join them in maryland 
the united states which has taken twothirds of minors 
resettled from thailand said in a recent policy statement it 
considers the children of profound humanitarian concern because 
of their vulnerability during flight and in refugee camps 
it said the practice of purposely sending children off with the 
intent of following them is abhorrent but that if families are 
persecuted the us government is not concerned with whether 
parents used children in this way 
the united states attempts to resettle all minors with us ties 
and whose families were persecuted it also will take half of all 
other minors who demonstrate persecution in their homelands but 
have no us links it also will consider paroling into the 
country those with us links who dont qualify as refugees 
some minors at a special center in phanat nikhom give accounts 
of enduring harsh ordeals after being sent off by their parents 
danh van ha about 7 years old said he was on a 13day 
stormtossed boat journey during which pirates robbed and raped 
passengers including a woman who was taking care of him 
another vietnamese boy suffered severe asthma on his journey and 
was hospitalized for a long time at the camp 
yet the children interviewed didnt question that their parents 
loved them but instead worried about not being able to fulfill 
what they see as their filial duty of getting resettled abroad 
bridget messana an american who runs the center for thailands 
catholic office of emergency relief and refugees said some 
children receive letters from arents angrily scolding them for 
misbehaving and taking so long to get resettled 
the children here play happily nevertheless but ms messana 
said some possibly wont be able to get along with foster parents 
in the united states or deal with problems likely to arise when 
theyre no longer in the protected environment of phanat nikhom 
when they get to the us and see the difficulty of the life 
their parents sent them to then the scars surface she said 
theyve been separated theyre not in their own community and 
all of this none of their own choice

like paul revere sandy simon goes around 
shouting the british are coming but he does it as the bearer of 
good news and his advice differs from reveres dont resist he 
might say sell out 
it is partly through activities of people such as sanford r 
simon that british interest in american business has never been 
higher with purchases announced weekly if not daily 
for many americans it is one of the more baffling business 
developments in years particularly since the british economy had 
until the 1980s spent years in the doldrums 
simons activities help explain the phenomenon 
representing buyers rather than sellers simon president of 
american corporate services searches out small and mediumsize 
companies that might make attractive acquisitions 
many of his clients are american companies but 20 are british 
concerns and one is swedish all are corporations seeking to 
expand and all view the american market as the place to proceed 
simons organization researches the possibilities seeks out 
companies that conceivably could be for sale and then approaches 
them we find and make available for sale something that isnt on 
the market he says 
the potential acquisition usually involves a privatelydocument 
by a 6336 vote 
the president vetoed the measure may 24 
backers of the trade legislation headed into todays senate 
showdown without enough votes to override reagans veto but they 
had refuse to abandon hope for the bill before thre vote

a 13yearold god a hindu christ and up to 
300 yorkshire locals have joined thespian forces in the north of 
england this month as the york mystery plays return to the stage 
reviving a centuries old theatrical form 
they so much belong to this city jude kelly artistic 
director of the york festival said of the mystery plays which 
form the centerpiece to the citywide festival running june 10 
july 10 
this year is the 10th staging of the york cycle since the 
medieval retelling of the bible was relaunched for modern audiences 
at the 1951 festival of britain 
victor banerjee who played dr aziz in the movie a passage to 
india portrays christ he is the first hindu actor to inherit a 
role that previously has been held by such established british 
performers as simon ward and christopher timothy the 300strong 
lineup of amateur talent around him includes jon lacy colson 13 
as a prepubescent god 
the mystery plays first appeared during the 13th century as 
religious entertainments performed in the vernacular telling the 
biblical story from the creation to judgment day 
other countries have their own versions such as the 
oberammergau passion play in germany in britain they were 
associated with towns with significant numbers of guilds each of 
which would perform a different biblical pageant as a thriving 
medieval city and the seat of englands second bishopric york 
became known for its particular cycle of plays other cities 
chester lincoln performed their versions as well 
the mystery plays fell out of favor during the reformation in 
the 16th century when interest shifted to william shakespeare and 
his peers interest was rekindled this century following world war 
ii as the british started to reexamine their literary heritage 
the 1988 york cycle is an adaptation by andrew wickes from the 
canonical version by the late rev js purvis 
religious dramas drawing on both the old and new testaments the 
york cycle takes over 3 hours performed outdoors in a 1514seat 
theater against the backdrop of a ruined abbey the cycle is a 
distillation of the 48 mystery plays written in the 14th century by 
the citys guilds and craftsmen 
performed in its entirety the york cycle would last 18 hours 
including musical interludes distilled it is a stage adventure 
that brings together outsiders and the local citizenry 
its a thing out of this world you hear the first chord of 
music the butterflies go up and down and youre away said betty 
doig a york native who first appeared in the 1976 cycle playing 
mary the mother of jesus with her husband and five of their seven 
children 
this year in addition to working backstage on props the 
67yearold mrs doig plays noahs wife in the first york cycle 
this century to include the story of noahs ark 
ive always wanted to box a man onstage mrs doig said of 
the role which requires her to get angry i think its 
marvelous 
as the lone professional in the company banerjee said he was 
moved by the enthusiasm of his nonprofessional colleagues 
its like walking out of 42nd street into a nunnery he said 
during a recent trip to the ancient cathedral city 
youre confronted with a new version of reality a sense of 
discovery that youd lost the kind of values you had when you 
began 
as a hindu who divides his time between homes in calcutta and 
mussoorie in the himalayan foothills banerjee said he was pleased 
and surprised to be offered the role of christ 
here i was being asked to play this part when i was living 
thousands of miles away and they had millions of people to choose 
from said banerjee who makes his british stage debut in the 
role 
its one thing to be chosen to play dr aziz but to play 
christ which is traditionally regarded as a blond and blueeyed 
part was a great thing kelly explained why she and the shows 
director steven pimlott chose banerjee we both pictured jesus 
as a dangerous man in terms of what he was saying a dark and 
wildeyed anarchist rather than someone pale and blond she said 
the personal religion of the actor was unimportant 
actors are always portraying people theyre not she said 
the fact that victor is not christian is irrelevant as an actor 
hes so marvelous

one familys struggle against apartheid 25 
years ago has come to the screen in a world apart a winner at 
the cannes film festival starring barbara hershey it provides a 
lowkey but compelling alternative to last years acclaimed cry 
freedom 
where richard attenboroughs cry freedom told its tragic 
story on an epic 16 million scale a world apart with its 6 
million budget tells how a daughter learns to cope with her 
mothers battle against apartheid 
whats important is that in america in britain everywhere 
people have an inkling of what racism is said chris menges the 
british director of the movie which opens june 17 in new york and 
july 1 in los angeles 
set in south africa in 1963 but shot in bulawayo zimbabwe last 
summer the film is a semifictional version of the reallife 
relationship that existed between south african journalist ruth 
first and her daughter shawn slovo 
slovo now 38 wrote the screenplay recreating her youth 
through the character of 13yearold molly roth played by jodhi 
may a young british newcomer 
barbara hershey plays mollys mother diana who is jailed for 
her activities on behalf of the african national congress anc 
the black guerrilla movement fighting to overthrow white rule in 
south africa 
in reality first was one of a few white founding members of the 
anc which was outlawed in 1963 
the movie covers several months in the shared politicalization 
of mother and daughter as molly learns to accept and understand a 
kind of commitment that puts social responsibilities before 
domestic concerns 
a world apart does not touch on later events in the familys 
lives in 1982 first was killed by a letter bomb in mozambique 
her husband joe slovo lives in exile today in zambia where he is 
the general secretary of the south african communist party and the 
only white member of the anc executive committee 
the film was twice honored at the 41st cannes film festival 
which ended may 23 in an unusual threeway vote hershey and may 
shared the best actress prize along with linda mvusi who plays the 
roths housekeeper elsie 
the film also won the special jury grand prize the runnerup 
in effect to the festivals most prestigious award the golden 
palm 
its the first feature film directed by menges 48 a 
documentary filmmaker and cinematographer who won two academy 
awards for his camerawork on the killing fields and the 
mission 
menges said he had been looking for a film to direct and was 
drawn to slovos script by its mixture of the personal and the 
political 
its about a child coming to terms with the political choices 
her parents have made its shawns coming to terms with her mom 
and dad said softspoken menges a father of five 
its a story about someone trying to work out the trauma of 
childhood which many of us have to work out 
the film exemplifies its directors devotion to material chosen 
out of personal belief rather than expediency 
ive always tried to work on projects i can learn from and i 
think are of value said menges who first went to south africa 
in 1963 to film a british tv documentary 
i was asked to do this story and i think it has something to 
say 
slovo said thoughts of her mother prompted her to write the 
script which she described in an interview as a mix of 
autobiography memory and fiction 
if my mother were still alive i dont think i would have done 
this particular story said slovo who began writing the script 
in 1983 after a stint in new york working as actor robert deniros 
secretary 
but in the aftermath of her assassination and trying to come 
to terms with the violent manner of her actual death this is the 
story that evolved

the primate of the greek orthodox church in the 
americas says attacks on michael dukakis religious situation are 
extremely unjustified and that he is a steadfast son of the 
church 
he is a member of the church was baptized in it and he has 
never left it archbishop iakovos says of the frontrunning 
democratic presidential contender who has been assailed as an 
apostate 
the attack is wrong in itself iakovos added in an 
interview his eyes flashed it came from small people 
in widely distributed letters james g jatras a staff member 
of the senate republican policy committee and a church layman 
called dukakis a renegade an outcast for his positions and his 
marriage to a jew 
jatras writing under his greek name dimitrios iatreidis said 
dukakis church membership was severed by your marriage outside 
the church iakovos termed that untrue 
the whitehaired archbishop 76 who has maintained 
relationships with dukakis and his parents since his boyhood noted 
that dukakis considers him his spiritual father and added 
we are proud that one of our young men has had the courage and 
determination to run for the highest office in the nation 
while making no formal endorsement avoided under church policy 
he said i would put it that 99 percent of us are very proud 
dukakis is a front runner and almost certain nominee 
iakovos recalling the years 1942 to l954 when he was dean of 
bostons annunciation cathedral to which the dukakis family 
belonged and where he still is a regularly contributing member 
said 
i remember him in his sunday school pupil days he was a 
frequent participant as a teenager the dukakis family was one of 
the best families in the church his father a physician his mother 
a teacher of english 
iakaovos who has talked with dukakis frequently over the years 
encouraging his political efforts sometimes praying with him said 
michael is a man who does much thinking who doesnt react 
emotionally he has a very good head on his shoulders hes very 
learned he is moderate not a man of extremes hes very prudent 
very careful very studious 
of dukakis marriage to a nonchristian which under church 
rules technically bars him from receiving communion as are 
divorced remarried roman catholics but does not excommunicate or 
remove him from membership iakovos said 
he did not leave the church he is not excluded hes not the 
only one who has married outside the church 
the archbishop said about 70 percent of greek orthodox marriages 
are with those of other denominations an increasing number with 
jews 
its happening more and more now he said i have a 
pastoral obligation to all our people to strengthen and encourage 
them 
he noted that dukakis visited archdiocesan headquarters on 
manhattans east 79th st on april 14 took part in vespers 
services and afterward met with iakovos in his chandeliered 
secondfloor offices 
we had a brief service in the chapel he said then we 
discussed freely some of the issues 
jatras made his charges in an open letter to dukakis sent to all 
orthodox bishops and many others as well as in letters to the 
weekly greek american which termed the attack a cheap political 
ploy 
jatras claimed dukakis excommunicated himself by marriage to 
a jew and is a traitor who defames our church by upholding 
legal abortion and opposing aid to contra rebels in nicaragua 
the archbishop said it was fanatic to attack a candidates 
church relationship i find it extremely unjustified to make such 
statements to attack anyone running for any office on the basis of 
his beliefs 
in this multicultural multinational society religion is 
not one of the criteria for being elected president of the united 
states 
while greek orthodoxy opposes abortion he said dukakis 
position resembled that of new york governor cuomo a roman 
catholic in contending political leaders must uphold the law and 
not try to impose their views about it 
the president is president of all citizens believers and 
nonbelievers as well iakovos said any transgressions across 
the border between state and church is at the expense of the unity 
of the nation 
he said he had encouraged dukakis decision to seek the 
presidency 
asked about dukakis religious commitment iakovos said this 
is a very subjective matter but dukakis has been a steady church 
member he has embraced it all these years this is not something 
new many times he would say i was his spiritual father 
through the campaign i think he is feeling much closer to the 
community than before 
he said that it seemed strange the attack about dukakis 
religion didnt come until he was running for the presidency but 
then they start scrutinizing his conformity to church rules 
if the man is qualified and god wants him to be president he 
will be michael has some of the qualities we seek in that 
position

unlike some roman catholic dioceses that have 
closed down services sponsored by the homosexual group dignity 
the chicago archdiocese simply has taken over the sponsorship 
in doing so cardinal joseph l bernardin said he was 
concerned that gay and lesbian catholics receive the pastoral 
care of their church and to make sure the churchs teaching on 
human sexuality is presented clearly 
officers of dignity which opposes the churchs condemnation of 
homosexual activity welcomed the move as providing an official 
church ministry to homosexuals 
bernardin said the groups questioning of church teachings made 
it inappropriate for the group to continue sponsoring a mass at st 
sebastian parish so sponsorship was being assumed by the 
archdiocese 
a l986 vatican document prohibited use of church facilities to 
groups opposed to church teachings and several dioceses had simply 
shut down dignitysponsored services

church historian bill j leonard says 
southern baptist churches increasingly are assigning more power to 
the clergy leading to a clergification of the denomination 
leonard of southern baptist theological seminary in louisville 
said the trend toward autocratic leadership by pastors often 
threatens to degrade the status of lay people 
it makes the laity secondclass citizens he said it 
undermines the most basic biblical understanding of the church as 
the whole people of god 
he said the clergy leadership style is becoming similar to a 
chief executive officer of a corporation and is more publicly 
visible in socalled superchurches but is also quite prevalent in 
smaller churches

lorents grosfields 15000acre ranch north 
of yellowstone national park is home to deer antelope bear and 
game birds its a paradise for hunters 
grosfield welcomes them if theyre among the select 100 
season permit holders whove paid 160 apiece for the 
privilege guests are charged 50 more each day 
in the east where most land ownership shifted to private hands 
generations ago such entrepreneurship might go unquestioned but 
in the vastness of montana which only a century ago was mostly 
wild land open to all and where most land is still publicly owned 
feehunting and closed lands are divisive issues 
the dispute is also being watched by sportsmen elsewhere because 
of the growing pressure on available land 
its an upwelling rather than an overwhelming wave as we see 
it but its clearly there and its going to become more and more 
important in the future said lynn greenwalt vice president for 
resources conservation of the national wildlife federation in 
washington dc 
the trend toward fee hunting has sparked debate between montana 
landowners protective of their property rights and sportsmen long 
accustomed to easy access to land for hunting and fishing 
some sportsmen accuse landowners like grosfield of trying to 
usurp a natural resource for themselves 
wildlife we feel belongs to the whole public not just to 
the particular individual said tony schoonen president of the 
montana wildlife federation if anybody takes and uses that 
resource as a personal gain its privatization 
landowners say its a way for farmers and ranchers to make some 
extra money and ease hunting pressure by controlling the number of 
hunters grosfield said it takes time to deal with each hunter who 
calls or knocks at the door 
a rancher is essentially subsidizing the recreating public 
to the extent of the time effort and expense it takes to 
accommodate that public theres something not equitable about 
that he said 
but its more than that 
its also kind of in response to what is seen as an overly 
aggressive attitude among some recreational groups to force issues 
like access especially with the stream access thing grosfield 
acknowledged 
the stream access thing is a raw issue in montana in 1985 
the legislature codified a supreme court decision giving sportsmen 
the right to cross property lines at will if they followed streams 
and stayed between the highwater marks 
jerome jack executive vice president of the montana 
stockgrowers association in helena described the decision as a 
bitter pill for ranchers and farmers many he suggested are 
posting their lands to hunters in frustration over losing control 
of their property 
you have seen a lot more orange paint on gateposts and a lot 
more limiting of access during the hunting season jack said the 
orange paint designates posted land 
but most landowners who charge hunting fees are more interested 
in the money than in defending the principle of private ownership 
said bob carlson of the skyline sportsmens club in butte 
the trend was already started before stream access became an 
issue said carlson im sure theres a lot of people who are 
using that as an excuse 
fee hunting also has increased the burden on property owners who 
still allow free access schoonen said 
as more and more private property owners close their land it 
throws more and more pressure on adjacent landowners who do allow 
hunting until they throw up their hands and decide to close 
their lands as well he said its like a domino effect you see 
it happening all over 
and some landowners while not charging a fee have restricted 
the numbers of hunters theyll allow on their land 
grosfield began charging fees four years ago before that he 
said it got to the point where he was simply overwhelmed by 
hunters 
we had a terrific amount of pressure between 800 and 1000 
hunter days per year now in looking back on it i just shake my 
head when i think about accommodating that many 
many private landowners of course continue to welcome hunters 
as long as they ask permission and conduct themselves properly 
we have full open access and its unusual to have problems 
said rancher joe etchart of glasgow we have some irritants cut 
fences and things like that but its a relatively small amount 
compared to the traffic 
but carlson fears feehunting is going to do away with hunting 
as we have known it in the past

arthur perdue never retired and he had a 
few words of advice on the subject for his son 
its like the throttle of an engine arthurs son frank 
perdue recalled as you get older you turn the throttle down a 
little bit 
frank perdue at 67 may be slowing down but its hard to tell 
although he recently stepped aside as chief executive officer of 
perdue farms inc the nations fourthlargest poultry producer 
hes still known nationwide as the tough guy who sells tender 
chickens 
its nothing like the end of an era said perdue who made 
himself and his poultry products famous through his television 
sales pitches i have lots of things to do 
perdue who followed his father into the chicken business at age 
10 remains chairman of the board and chief promoter of his 
products he plans to stay active in the business and keep peddling 
his wares on television while donald w mabe president of the 
company takes over the reins as ceo 
i will be very visible and ill probably be on the road a 
lot perdue said in an interview 
mabe who has answered only to perdue for 28 of his 30 years 
with the company is content with perdue in the forefront of their 
marketing and advertising efforts 
i dont think i can replace frank it would be like someone 
trying to replace colonel sanders frank is so identifiable with 
our product he would be hard to replace frank perdue is here 
to stay mabe said 
and so is his poultry business today perdue farms has seven 
poultry processing facilities and a turkey processing subsidiary 
enabling it to process 6 million broilers and 15 million pounds of 
turkey per week 
the company has more than 14000 employees and holds contracts 
with more than 2000 independent chicken and turkey producers in 
delaware maryland virginia north carolina and indiana 
perdue products are found along the east coast from maine to 
north carolina and are breaking into the midwest market in 
cleveland in fiscal year 198687 perdue farms had sales of 964 
million 
there are going to be ups and downs in this business because 
there always has been said perdue assessing his companys 
prospects for growth there is an awful lot of production right 
now and when you get into a position of oversupply you suffer 
lower earnings 
but looking ahead 10 years the odds are people will be eating 
less beef and less pork due to a dietconscious public perdue 
said 
if anyone is qualified to make such a judgment its perdue who 
has worked his way up from the chicken coop to the boardroom in 
1920 arthur perdue bought 50 leghorn chickens for 5 and entered 
the table egg business in salisbury frank was put to work at a 
tender age and given responsibility for the care of a few dozen 
chickens 
after graduating from high school the young perdue attended a 
local college for two years then decided the egg business wasnt 
as bad as i thought 
in 1939 frank left college to rejoin the family business which 
then consisted of three employees frank and his father included 
the operation grew eventually shifting from selling table eggs 
to the hatching and growing of broilers when frank became 
president in 1950 perdue farms had 40 employees and was one of the 
largest chicken growers on marylands eastern shore the broilers 
were sold to major companies such as swift and armour which 
marketed the perdue chickens under their own brand names 
in 1968 with 400 employees perdue farms purchased its first 
processing plant in salisbury and perdue brand chickens hit the 
market 
the companys recent expansion into turkeys was a natural 
extension of the processing business and with turkey becoming a 
yearround food the move was timely 
perdue farms entered the turkey business in 1984 with the 
acquisition of shenandoah valley poultry co inc in bridgewater 
va and shenandoah farms inc in washington ind 
the turkey market is growing slowly but mabe and perdue 
predicted it will continue to become more attractive to consumers 
the company recently began producing ground turkey which perdue 
said is popular because it looks a little like hamburger but has 
tremendously less calories 
mabe called it a lowcost alternative to ground beef 
in the expanding prepared food market both men said the 
companys precooked chicken called perdue done it has a good 
future 
anytime youre on the leading edge like we are with the 
freshcooked chicken products there are some difficulties mabe 
said 
the problem is getting the trial take the hot roast chicken 
its probably better than what you can roast at home but people 
arent used to buying like that he said 
mabe said the chain stores were anxious to stock the products 
because theyre competing with fastfood restaurants 
weve had no trouble getting shelf space on this product and 
as more people take it well move more of it mabe said 
perdue summed up the future of the company without giving away 
any secrets 
i think we will continue to do what we do better and as 
opportunities present themselves well look at them 
asked if mabe would one day become chairman perdue replied i 
would say that my demise has been tremendously overexaggerated and 
lets just say hes certainly capable but i hope to be around for 
a while

forty teenagers from 22 states join 40 
south dakota indian youths saturday to live together for a week on 
the pine ridge indian reservation 
the plan is to have them share heritages of religion legend and 
song the hope is that the friendships formed will give them fresh 
appreciation of their nations diversity and each individuals 
worth 
the whole idea is to address prejudice and discrimination in a 
very subtle way said rose marie ohm of the national conference 
of christians and jews which is sponsoring the event 
its like a big rainbow by interacting through direct 
contact they learn to appreciate each other how to work 
together 
the national conference of christians and jews a nonprofit 
organization that works to improve communication and understanding 
among conflicting groups in american society has chosen 40 
students from different backgrounds and regions of the country to 
attend the youth conference 
the united sioux tribes helped select indian students from 12 
tribes who live on reservations and in urban areas around south 
dakota to attend the conference being held at the high school in 
pine ridge 
the pine ridge reservation is a region of rolling grassy hills 
topped with pine trees in southwestern south dakota its territory 
includes shannon county one of the poorest in the nation 
pine ridge school principal imogene horse said the meeting 
should help indian teenagers better understand young people from 
other parts of the country some of the students cannot afford to 
travel she said so they havent had much contact with people from 
outside western south dakota 
i think it will be good for the indian students beause of the 
isolation factor out here the principal said i believe the 
students and adults who attend this will learn much about each 
others cultures 
ohm said the national conference of christians and jews sponsors 
other conferences aimed at helping young people develop leadership 
skills participants have included indian youths in the past but 
the pine ridge event is the first time on indian turf said 
harry robinson nccj vice president for communications 
the conference has a theme of educating for the 21st century 
rights risks and responsibilities and is designed to help the 
students sharpen the skills to become leaders in a diverse socity 
ohm said they will work to find their own ideas for addressing the 
problems of the future she said 
daily workshops will deal with cultural awareness racial 
understanding friendships dating family relationships and other 
issues faced by all young people by living together the high 
school juniors and seniors will also learn to get along with people 
from other backgrounds ohm said 
on sunday evening the students will fill a poster spanning two 
walls at the school with their names races ethnic identities and 
a dozen other categories giving a visual representation of their 
diversity ohm said 
on the final full day of the pine ridge conference june 16 
students from various ethnic groups will give presentations on 
their cultures the indians of pine ridge will present a special 
program 
arthur zimiga who works with a united methodist church program 
in rapid city to help indian youth learn job and social skills they 
need in todays world helped recruit the indian participants 
the meeting should help the south dakota students realize the 
state and its indian reservations are not isolated islands but 
instead a part of the rest of the nation zimiga said 
these young people should have an opportunity to be a part of 
the decisionmaking process and also to have an opportunity to 
lead zimiga said 
one of the students who will attend the conference mark pakula 
a 17yearold from leawood kan said he hoped to get a better 
undertanding of people from different races and backgrounds 
everyone is a person and they really shouldnt be treated any 
differently he said

the 1989 ford probe can be hazardous to drive 
the problem is not with the car but with other folks who want to 
get a good look at it 
during the time i had a probe gl test car i was chased at 80 
mph down a freeway by two guys in a spanking newlooking pontiac 
grand prix who wanted to check out the probe their grand prix just 
made its debut this model year 
i also encountered an older fellow who nearly stopped in the 
middle of intersection so he could get a gander at my probe 
traffic in my neighborhood picked up one sunday as people came back 
around the block to get second and third looks at the probe 
and the probe was immediately surrounded by curious sales people 
at a honda dealership i visited 
it sure seems that ford has an attentiongetter with this 
aerodynamic funtodrive small specialty car that was unveiled in 
chicago in february and went on sale in may ford already has 
70000 orders which amounts to this years full production at the 
flat rock mich plant where the car is built eventual plant 
capacity could reach 150000 annually 
the frontdrive probe is unique in a couple ways though sold in 
ford showrooms the car was designed with the help of mazda motor 
corp of japan and is being produced at the mazda plant in flat 
rock by united auto workers members 
the plant the first us assembly plant operated by a japanese 
automaker to be organized by the uaw also builds the mazda version 
of the probe called the mazda mx6 which shares many components 
with the probe 
ford by the way owns 25 percent of mazda 
but the probe differs from the mx6 in appearance inside and 
out conveying a more modern sleek image and for all the 
attention it gets it doesnt cost a mint base price for the gl 
the lowestpriced version of the probe was 10459 the test car 
with optional premium sound system cast aluminum wheels air 
conditioning and automatic transmission totaled 13186 
ford also offers an upscale lx model which starts at around 
11400 and a topoftheline performance gt which sports a 
spoiler fog lamps and turbocharged engine and starts at around 
13600 
those prices put the probe squarely in contention with its 
japanese competitors the honda prelude which starts around 
14000 and the toyota celica which starts around 12000 
the test car the lowend probe gl had commendable suspension 
and good handling however the standard engine a 22liter 
electronic fuelinjected fourcylinder didnt quite seem to 
deliver the power one would want in such a sleek sassylooking car 
cloth front bucket seats were comfortable enough but leg room 
in the back was a problem 
fit and finish inside and out was admirable and the tilt 
steering was different causing the whole steering module 
including instrument cluster to move up and down it was a nice 
touch considering the feature meant never having to worry about a 
steering wheel adjustment obscuring the view of one of the gauges 
it took some getting used to the blinker it wasnt a stalk on 
the side of the steering column rather it was a small lever 
attached to the dash 
likewise the headlights were not activated by the traditional 
pushpull knob on the dash nor the turn of a switch at the end of a 
blinker stalk instead the retractable headlights came out and on 
when a large dial on the side of the instrument cluster was turned 
the rear cargo area was deep and roomy but items had to be 
lifted up and over the rear of the car the probe is aimed at 
young careeroriented buyers a ford statement said 
specifically targeted buyers have a median age of 30 55 
percent are single half are male and they have a median annual 
income of 33000 said ford analyst ray windecker the major 
occupations expected to be represented among probe drivers include 
professionaltechnical workers and managers he added 
there have been several reports that the probe is designed to 
replace the ford mustang which has been around since the 1960s 
ford says the two cars will be sold sidebyside in showrooms 
and the mustang will remain as long as there is consumer demand 
because the probe is just arriving on the market there are no 
reliability reports

the confidence of american consumers jumped in may to its 
highest level since the end of the 1960s according to a conference 
board report that could bode well for future economic growth 
the conference board a businesssupported research group says 
its monthly consumer confidence index does a better job of 
predicting growth than the governments index of leading economic 
indicators 
in other economic news tuesday the government said americans 
increased their installment borrowing at a moderate annual rate of 
7 percent in april as growth in consumer credit slowed from the 
first three months of the year 
and in another report the federal home loan bank board said 
interest rates on 30year fixedrate home mortgages climbed in may 
for the second consecutive month the national average for 
conventional singlefamily loans jumped to 1063 percent in early 
may up from 1048 percent in early april it said 
stock prices fell as the dow jones average of 30 industrials up 
11877 points over the past five sessions dropped 2062 to 
205459 bond prices also sank in reaction to renewed fears of 
inflation 
consumers confidence seems to be the result of low unemployment 
and low inflation said fabian linden executive director of the 
conference boards consumer research center 
nevertheless the optimism was somewhat surprising in light of a 
report monday by the bureau of labor statistics that said 
americans pay in the first three months of 1988 failed to keep 
them ahead of inflation for the fifth consecutive quarter 
not since the spiraling inflation of 197981 have workers gone 
so long without an improvement in their standard of living through 
wage gains the bureau said 
the boards consumer confidence index jumped 35 points to 1192 
in the may survey that was up 162 points over its level of a year 
earlier and the highest since december 1969 when it stood at 1260 
the conference board commissions a monthly survey of 5000 
households throughout the united states 
all of the ingredients that give the consumer a sense of 
wellbeing are working together at this moment linden said 
the index has been kept since january 1969 and was recently 
recalibrated against a base of 100 points in 1985 
in its report on installment borrowing the federal reserve 
board said consumers took out 365 billion more in credit than 
they paid off in april compared with net growth of 52 billion in 
march 50 billion in february and 62 billion in january 
the annual rate of growth in april was slightly slower than the 
72 percent rate for all of 1987 and considerably slower than the 
approximately 107 percent pace for the first quarter of 1988 
however economists saw the slowing as a healthy trend at a time 
when us manufacturers are trying to boost their production for 
export 
whats happened is what should be happening consumer spending 
is cooling off and freeing up resources to produce for export 
said sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a 
washington consulting firm 
the whole transition from a consumerled economy to an 
exportled economy assumes we can cool off consumer demand in order 
to avoid heated up inflation she said

all may not be well with the american economy 
but a new survey says consumers confidence rose in may to its 
highest point since the soaring sixties 
the conference board a businesssupported research group said 
monday its consumer confidence index of 1192 in may was the 
strongest since december 1969 when it stood at 1260 
its pretty impressive said fabian linden executive 
director of the boards consumer research center he described 
consumers as somewhat euphoric 
all of the ingredients that give the consumer a sense of 
wellbeing are working together at this moment linden said 
mentioning strong employment gains and restrained inflation 
the conference board commissions a monthly survey of 5000 
households throughout the united states 
the consumer confidence index jumped 35 points from the april 
level and 162 points from its level of may 1987 
the index has been kept since january 1969 and was recently 
recalibrated to a base of 100 for 1985 
the strength of consumer confidence is surprising in light of 
the labor departments report monday that most workers have failed 
to stay ahead of inflation for five quarters in a row 
not since the spiraling inflation of 197981 have workers gone 
that long without an improvement in their standard of living 
through wage gains the bureau of labor statistics said 
the conference boards survey indicated more optimism than 
another report released tuesday by the international association 
for financial planning but the latter was based on a survey 
conducted three months earlier 
that survey of 1008 peoplefound that 39 percent said it is 
harder this year than a few years ago to pay their bills and still 
have money left over in contrast to 29 percent who said it was 
easier 
also 39 percent said the next generation will have worse 
financial opportunities than those available today while 29 
percent said the opportunities would be better 
linden said consumers confidence probably was helped by their 
feelings of job security the labor department reported friday that 
unemployment had edged up to 56 percent in may from its 14year 
low of 54 percent in april 
the average workweek has lengthened linden noted meaning 
people are working more overtime and bringing home bigger paychecks 
also linden said consumer price inflation is low enough that 
it is not noticed by shoppers from week to week 
the strength of consumers confidence is good news for the 
economy said linden who contends the consumer confidence index is 
more accurate than the governments index of leading economic 
indicators in predicting economic growth 
nearly 32 percent of those surveyed considered business 
conditions to be good up from 28 percent in april almost 31 
percent said jobs were plentiful up from less than 21 percent the 
month before 
only 55 percent said they expected business conditions to 
deteriorate in the next six months down about a percentage point 
from april that figure had risen to more than 12 percent in 
november after the stock market collapse 
buying plans were also firm of those surveyed 94 percent said 
they planned to buy a car in the next six months up from 91 
percent in april 35 percent said they planned to buy a major 
appliance the same as in april and 3 percent said they planned to 
buy a home down from 35 percent in april 
the conference board began monitoring consumer confidence in 
1967 the index began in january 1969 and was higher than it is now 
throughout its first year it fell sharply in january 1970 as the 
economy headed into a recession

texaco inc says it plans to give its 
shareholders a third of the proceeds from the 5 billion it plans 
to raise by the end of the year in sales of assets as part of its 
restructuring plan 
but the white plains nybased oil giant said tuesday that it 
had not decided how the distribution would be made promising 
either a stock buyback program or some other method 
the distribution may involve cash or the use of securities in 
anticipation of the proceeds to be realized from the sales 
program texaco said in a statement 
the rest of the proceeds will be used to repay debt strengthen 
the balance sheet and fund increased capital investment programs 
for selected retained operations it added 
the move which came in the midst of a proxy fight between 
texaco and takeover specialist carl c icahn stirred little 
enthusiasm on wall street in consolidated nationwide trading of 
new york stock exchangelisted issues texaco closed at 51 per 
share up 12 cents 
richard s pzena who studies oil companies for the sanford c 
bernstein amp co securites firm said traders took a dim view of the 
move because its not like theyre giving the shareholders 
something they dont already own 
icahn is running a fiveman slate for the board of directors 
hoping to a victory will help him get the board to let shareholders 
vote on his 60pershare cash offer for the company the votes are 
to be cast at texacos annual meeting on june 17 
by adding some value to shares already hovering in the 50 
range texaco in effect was diluting the impact of icahns 60 cash 
offer pzena said thereby strengthening its chances of beating 
icahn in the proxy fight 
texacos latest announcement came just 24 hours after it said it 
had agreed to sell its 9912 percent interest in deutsche texaco ag 
of west germany to a major utility in that country 
rheinishwestfaelisches elektrizitaetswerk ag also known as 
rwe agreed to pay over 12 billion for the subsidiary both sides 
expect no problems with a requirement that west germanys federal 
cartel office approve the transaction 
updating its progress in other aspects of its reorganization 
plan texaco said tuesday it expected to generate more than 18 
billion more in two other upcoming transactions 
one is a deal to sell 60 million barrels of oil and gas 
equivalent reserves expected to close by the end of this month 
the other involves proposals to establish joint ventures with 
venezuela and saudi arabia 
the ventures which were in advanced stages of review would 
involve three texaco refineries and related marketing facilities on 
the east and gulf coasts 
studies are also continuing on what to do with its 78 percent 
interest in texaco canada inc including the possible sale merger 
or joint venture of some or all of the stake texaco said 
in addition it said it was considering the potential sales of 
other domestic oil and gas properites of marginal value to the 
company as well as certain european and african holdings 
the restructuring program is also expected to yield more than 
50 million in additional savings in overhead from staff 
consolidations texaco said 
the latest developments are a result of months of negotiations 
that began as texaco prepared for its april emergence from a year 
under chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection 
in april 1987 texaco filed for that protection to avoid having 
to post an 11 billion security bond while appealing a 103 
billion judgment held against it by pennzoil co a jury ruled 
texaco had interfered with pennzoils 1984 attempt to acquire part 
of getty oil co so it could buy getty itself 
in december texaco agreed to settle the suit by paying 3 
billion to pennzoil as part of a restructuring plan that included 
sales of 3 billion worth of assets 
soon afterward icahn its largest stockholder with 148 percent 
of the companys shares stepped up pressure on texacos management 
to do more to increase the value of its stock 
in march he threatened to run his slate of five candidates 
including himself for texacos board if the company did not take 
steps that would raise the price to 55 per share from thencurrent 
levels in the 35to45 range 
in an apparent bid for stockholder support texaco announced the 
restoration of its dividend and an expansion of its planned asset 
sales to 5 billion a month later 
but icahn unsatisfied proceeded with his 60pershare offer 
for those texaco shares he does not already known and launched his 
threatened proxy fight

opec oil ministers scheduled to meet saturday in 
vienna austria are expected to put aside talk of an alliance with 
other producing nations and focus instead on their old familiar 
problem of production quotas 
six weeks ago the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
failed in an attempt to work out an agreement with six noncartel 
nations for cutting oil output to bolster world oil prices 
now industry analysts say the regular midyear meeting will 
probably have to face up to the issue of controlling its own 
production quota system 
currently 12 of the cartels 13 members are pledged to hold 
their output at 1506 million barrels of crude oil a day iraq is 
the only member that refused to go along with the pact which was 
extended last december and is due to expire june 30 
while the quotas were designed to support oil prices at 18 a 
barrel prices have been hovering about 150 a barrel below that 
level 
nonetheless analysts said they expected opec to extend the 
current quotas through the second half of the year and focus on 
related internal issues 
these would include persuading iraq to accept a quota and 
defining oil production more strictly to discourage cheating 
venezuela is leading one faction that would like to see output 
cut at least marginally to get prices up nearer to 18 said fergus 
macleod an analyst with the london investment firm barclays de 
zoete wedd ltd 
but a group led by saudi arabia would like to see a small 
increase in quotas to match projections of higher demand in the 
rest of the year he said 
macleod said it would be difficult to see how the two camps 
could be reconciled adding the most likely outcome when they 
cant agree is a rollover of the existing agreement 
in new york paul mlotok an oil analyst with salomon brothers 
inc said he did not expect any major changes saying the meeting 
would not be dramatic 
at shearson lehman hutton inc in london peter gignoux 
managing director of the international energy department said he 
also expects opec to focus on the tangential matters opec will 
be more introspective he said 
iraq does not abide by the quota agreement because it wants a 
production quota equal to that of iran with which it has been at 
war since 1980 
irans quota is 2369 million barrels a day iraqs quota under 
a previous agreement was 154 million barrels a day but it is 
believed to be producing 265 million barrels daily now 
some opec members have been accused of cheating by classifying 
oil as condensate which is an extremely light crude oil or as oil 
to be used in their own refineries neither kind counts against 
official quotas 
kuwait claims that 2 million barrels of opec oil a day are not 
being properly counted mlotok said its significant he said 
at the cartels earlier special meeting in vienna the cartel 
made its first major attempt to create a worldwide coalition of oil 
producers to boost oil prices 
the nonopec members have not been invited to this weeks 
meeting but mexico might attend unofficially said fergus macleod 
an analyst with the london investment firm barclays de zoete wedd 
ltd 
venezuela an aggressive promoter of the coalition approach has 
been working to expand the nonopec group and has persuaded 
trinidad and tobago to join it macleod said 
at the end of the april 28may 2 gathering the opec ministers 
asked a committee of six members saudi arabia venezuela 
nigeria kuwait algeria and indonesia to continue negotiations 
with nonopec nations 
i dont expect an agreement with nonopec although i expect 
ongoing discussions mlotok said 
macleod said most in opec want to carry on talking to 
nonopec countries in the hope that if there isnt an agreement to 
cut back now there might be in the spring of next year 
saudi arabia opecs largest producer led a minority group in 
blocking the proposal to jointly cut production which was first 
put forward by the nonopec group 
the final proposal called for opec to cut oil production by 
300000 barrels a day during may and june when oil prices 
traditionally are weak while the nonopec group would cut output 
by 5 percent or 183000 barrels a day 
saudi arabia argued that opec and nonopec nations should cut 
production by the same amount of barrels a day and that the opec 
cut should be borne equally by all opec members 
the nonopec group consisted of mexico egypt china angola 
oman and malaysia colombia participated but would not have been 
required to cut its output

computer chip makers as thirsty as 
cattlemen and farmers in the deepening drought say theyll swallow 
the rising costs of using millions of gallons of water without 
raising prices 
that could change however if the water shortage becomes so 
acute that it not only pushes up the costs of obtaining and 
treating water but also limits production 
extremely pure water and lots of it is essential to 
semiconductor manufacturing to wash away microscopic debris on the 
tiny circuits 
so far the water shortage is more an annoyance than a crisis as 
companies try to conserve water while making plans for a possible 
switch from san franciscos system to local groundwater 
the groundwater hardened by such minerals as iron manganese and 
calcium requires a different purification process and that change 
could cost each company hundreds of thousands of dollars 
it sounds like a lot but thats really a minor increase in our 
manufacturing costs john grenagle of advanced micro devices inc 
in sunnyvale said this week the higher water costs also would be 
minimal and wouldnt affect the price of chips 
an extra cost he said may come from conservation as advanced 
micro devices joins other companies in trying to cut back water use 
by 25 percent 
one of the ways of making sure you get good chips is to flood 
them with a lot of chemicals which means youre using a lot of 
water he said we may decrease the amount of flooding we do 
which may increase some of the rejects which represents a cost 
all those costs combined will come out of advanced micro 
devices bottom line and not the customers wallet grenagle said 
mainly because the price of chips is competitiondriven rather 
than costdriven 
smaller chip companies such as siliconix inc of santa clara 
also are loathe to raise prices and will absorb the extra costs 
the drought really hasnt hit us yet but if we have to spend 
200000 to 300000 to handle well water thats a lot to us a few 
cents a share off the profits said tom boag director of plant 
and computer services at siliconix 
the lawns and flowers around siliconix may suffer but the 
company says it cant cut back much on the 13 million gallons it 
uses a month making silicon wafers transistors and linear 
integrated circuits 
siliconix is more fortunate than some rivals though it bought 
equipment last year that cleans its wafers more efficiently with 
the side benefit of using 15 to 20 percent less water 
we feel were in pretty good shape to meet the citys request 
to cut back 25 percent boag said we can always squeeze out 
another 5 percent just by being very careful and turning off sinks 
and equipment 
the chip companies have not been given mandatory reduction rules 
yet although several cities are considering them 
no one has asked industry to shut down because of the drought 
but theyve certainly been asked to conserve as much as they can 
said dan kriege manager of operations at the santa clara valley 
water district 
the valley normally uses about 400000 acre feet of water a 
year officials want to reduce that to 350000 acre feet this year 
if the chip makers are forced to switch to groundwater kriege 
said that could threaten the stability of the land 
if we pump out too much water from the groundwater base then 
were going to have some sites where the ground starts sinking 
he said 
it has occurred several times in the last 80 years and caused 
plenty of damage he added some places the ground sank 13 
feet were trying to prevent it from happening again

market has been trading in a relatively narrow range well below 
the official 18 price set for oil produced by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
more than anything the market continues to have a bearish

chrysler corp has agreed to begin recalling and 
repairing 93000 of its 1981model small cars in august to meet a 
1986 environmental protection agency emissions recall order the 
epa said 
the federal agency ordered the recall of the dodge omni and 024 
and the plymouth horizon and tc3 all with 17liter engines and 
manual transmissions because tests showed emissions levels 
exceeded standards 
tests showed emissions levels of 14 grams per mile while the 
standard for 1981 was 1 gram per mile the epa said tuesday it 
believed excess emissions resulted from deteriorating catalytic 
converters 
chrysler initially chose to contest the order charging the 
tests were not conducted properly but chrysler withdrew its 
challenge and agreed instead to recall and repair the vehicles 
the repair will include modifying the vacuum line to the 
engines electronic sparkcontrol computer 
chryslers withdrawal of its challenge was the second since epa 
began recalling vehicles for emissions repairs in 1972 
in may general motors corp withdrew a challenge to a 1985 
order and the vehicles involved will be recalled in september the 
epa said

takeover target macmillan inc today rejected 
proposals by texas billionaire robert m bass to acquire the 
publishing company for 19 billion or to participate in its 
planned restructuring 
in a statement macmillan said its board of directors reaffirmed 
its belief that its own restructuring plan is in the best interests 
of shareholders 
the plan would split the company in two and pay shareholders a 
special dividend of 5235 a share the dividend is scheduled to be 
paid friday 
but in a lawsuit filed in delaware chancery court bass who 
owns about 91 percent of macmillans roughly 26 million 
outstanding shares is seeking a temporary restraining order to 
halt the payout 
separately on tuesday the investment firm coniston partners 
disclosed it has accumulated a 49 percent stake in macmillan and 
filed an affidavit in support of basss effort to block the 
dividend payout 
augustus oliver a principal of the aggressive firm said 
coniston is not acting in concert with bass and only wants to see 
the publishing and information services company sold to the highest 
bidder 
oliver would not comment on whether coniston is positioning 
itself to engage in a bidding war with bass 
were interested in seeing a full auction for the company and 
having it sold to the highest bidder he said oliver said 
macmillans value is more in the neighborhood of 85 to 100 a 
share while many analysts have suggested 85 a share might be a 
top price 
we believe that macmillans restructuring is an inappropriate 
response to basss bid and that its a flagrant abuse of the 
boards fiduciary duty oliver said 
as an alternative to his 73ashare cash bid bass proposed a 
similar restructuring that also would split macmillan into two 
publicly held companies but his plan would pay shareholders a 
58ashare dividend 
macmillan said its restructuring doubly rewards shareholders 
by bringing them significant immediate value and the opportunity to 
participate in the future of two highgrowth publicly traded 
investment opportunities 
in addition to the dividend shareholders would receive for each 
macmillan share a halfshare of common stock in macmillan 
information co and 450 in principal amount of macmillan 
information subordinated debentures 
the company would be split into macmillan publishing co and 
macmillan information 
in early trading on the new york stock exchange today macmillan 
was up 50 cents a share at 76 
analysts have said basss initial 64ashare bid made last 
month as well as macmillans restructuring still left room for a 
third party interested in competing for the company 
this is the first time coniston has surfaced since its recent 
unsuccessful proxy battle for four seats on the board of gillette 
co the partnership typically purchases a large stake in a company 
and then pressures management to restructure or take some other 
action to boost the price of its stock 
coniston successfully used that tactic last year with united 
airlines parent which spun off its westin hotels hilton 
international and hertz car rental operations as a result

a federal appellate courts decision to lift an 
injunction barring eastern airlines from selling its northeast 
shuttle operation is not a great setback attorneys for two of 
easterns unions agree 
theres no emergency here said james l linsey who 
represents the air line pilots association 
our view is that it comes down to a very narrow procedural 
decision said joseph guerrieri jr an attorney for the 
international association of machinists which filed the suit in 
which the injunction was issued 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington tuesday lifted a 
contempt citation issued against eastern but gave the machinists 10 
days to seek a temporary restraining order to stop the airline from 
selling the popular shuttle to another subsidiary of its parent 
company texas air corp 
even if eastern ultimately wins it still must face a lawsuit 
brought by the pilots union which has persuaded another federal 
judge to halt the transfer of work opportunities from eastern 
to other companies 
lawyers for both sides agreed to a timetable for proceedings 
that will keep the shuttle transaction on hold until the company 
gives the court 10 days notice of the closing of the transaction 
that notification would not come until august 26 according to 
bruce hicks a spokesman for texas air 
in march us district judge john h pratt ruling on the suit 
filed by the machinists said eastern had flouted a july 1987 order 
he had issued barring the carrier from transferring 6000 ground 
crew members to another subsidiary by taking steps to sell the 
eastern air shuttle 
tuesday a threejudge panel directed pratt to conduct further 
hearings if the machinists continue their challenge to determine if 
an injunction barring the sale is warranted 
the court found no basis for pratt to cite eastern for contempt 
of court and held that the proposed 225 million shuttle sale was 
not precluded by pratts earlier injunction 
the panel also concluded unanimously that pratt had made an 
incomplete factual finding when issuing a new injunction against 
selling the bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle 
the machinists union which represents 13000 eastern employees 
contends texas air is trying to break up easterns components to 
weaken the power of the unions at the financially troubled carrier 
charles bryan president of easterns machinists local called 
the appeals court ruling disappointing because its going to be 
more costly and it will entail more legal fees and litigation but 
we have absolute confidence in our legal postion 
bryan said the appeals court based its dismissal of the 
injunction on procedural matters only and now that the case has 
been remanded to pratt the temporary restraining order will be 
judged on its merits 
its difficult to comprehend how a judge who has already held 
them in contempt will turn around and go and sell it he added at 
a miami news conference 
eastern spokesman robin matell said we are pleased with the 
decision and are studying its implications 
the decision is the latest chapter in a series of bitter legal 
battles between eastern and its unions texas air headed by frank 
lorenzo acquired eastern in 1986 it also operates continental 
airlines

it may look more like a coffee klatch 
than researchers hard at work on a new product but thats the 
whole idea 
the concept of group decisionmaking triggered by spontaneous 
encounters is shaping the design of a 75 million research and 
development center being built at steelcase inc the worlds 
leading designer and manufacturer of office furniture 
not only does the new sevenstory pyramidshaped building 
represent a shift in steelcases own corporate culture the company 
also hopes to market the concept of group creativeness to its 
customers 
buying new furniture and computers wont get people to be more 
productive company spokesman peter jeff said customers are 
coming to us with a larger agenda they want to understand how they 
can work better and how their people can work better 
but before we can be the office environment company for anyone 
else we have to be it for ourselves 
though teamwork and spontaneous meetings are nothing new its 
unusual for a company of steelcases size to tinker with success 
the 76yearold company had about 15 billion in sales last year 
it controls about a quarter of the office furniture market 
according to annasses it on to the next person veneklasen said 
were taking the rugby team approach the designers the 
engineers the manufacturing people the marketing people and the 
corporate communications people will pass the ball back and 
forth but all going in the same direction at the same time 
the 573000foot building will feature stateoftheart 
laboratories for perfecting the office environment including 
research on office acoustics lighting and temperature control 
steelcase has said the center will serve as a springboard for 
its future plans to add 8000 employees to its worldwide work 
force of 17500 by the turn of the century 
it sees the consulting service as a natural extension of its 
existing business where single chairs carry price tags of up to 
900 and big orders for major companies can run into the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars jeff says steelcase plans no extra charge 
to customers for its logistical advice 
indeed such consulting is fast becoming a popular addition to 
the industrys sales pitch 
its not just a question of putting in a desk and a couple of 
file cabinets anymore said simon de groot communications 
director for national office products association in alexandria 
va the aim now is to create an environment that allows office 
workers to take full advantage of new technology and be as 
productive as possible 
but when it comes to advising clients is steelcases open style 
for everyone some researchers say the concept of group 
creativeness at the heart of japanese industry may not work in a 
society where individualism is king 
its like changing somebodys religion said william k 
redmon an assistant professor at western michigan who has been 
studying how well us companies are adjusting to japanese work 
practices 
even for steelcase the team approach may make some managers 
uncomfortable 
its going to take time for everybody to get used to it 
admitted veneklasen

the commodity futures trading commission has 
accused refco inc one of the worlds largest trading firms of 11 
commodities law violations 
in addition to chicagobased refco the federal regulatory 
agencys administrative complaint named nine individuals and the 
paragon futures association a defunct company whose trades were 
guaranteed by refco 
woodstock illbased paragon and four individuals settled the 
administrative charges tuesday without admitting wrongdoing the 
charges against refco and five other people will go to a formal 
hearing 
the cftcs complaint alleges that in 1985 the firms and 
individuals made unauthorized trades in customers accounts failed 
to supervise employees and violated recordkeeping and disclosure 
rules 
the most serious charge is churning which means trading a 
customers account often and often unprofitably just to 
generate commissions for brokers 
refco said 12 of paragons customers were affected by the 
alleged churning 
most of the charges involved paragon and its employees the cftc 
said paragon closed shop in july 1985 after customer complaints of 
churning 
refco said it refused to settle the charges with the cftc 
because it should not be punished for the wrongdoing of another 
firm refco also said it terminated paragon after hearing 
complaints of churning

the senate scheduled final congressional 
approval late wednesday on a catastrophic health insurance bill 
that provides additional financial protection for 29 million 
elderly americans on medicare 
the house adopted a conference committee compromise by a 32872 
vote last week and similarly overwhelming senate approval was 
assured 
with the major debate behind and dozens of compromises long 
since reached the senate scheduled only 45 minutes for the formal 
finishing touch that was set to send the measure to the white house 
for president reagans expected signature 
although there has been no formal word from the white house 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen has said he will 
ask the president to sign the measure 
the major portion of the bill the first significant expansion 
of medicare since the program was born 23 years ago takes effect 
next jan 1 
however some parts such as the firstever general 
prescription drug benefit under medicare are to be phased in over 
four years 
in addition to the historic nature of the benefit expansion the 
bill has particular significance in the way it is financed 
the beneficaries are expected to pay all of of the additional 
costs on top of a flat monthly premium to be assessed on every 
medicare beneficiary 400 a month to start the estimated 40 
percent of the elderly with enough income to be liable for federal 
income taxes will be charged a supplemental premium based on their 
ability to pay 
in general an individual would have to have an annual income of 
more than 10000 before being subject to the additional premium 
which amounts to a tax surcharge 
although expanded considerably as it worked its way through 
congress the final bill is based on a proposal put forth more than 
a year ago by reagan at the urging of bowen 
it provides full hospital coverage after a onceayear 
deductible estimated at 564 in 1989 and indexed to hospital 
inflation medicare now pays full charges for no more than 59 days 
a year and the recipient is subject to a deductible for each 
hospitalization 
the cap on costs for physicians is 1370 a year after a 75 
deductible medicare now pays 80 percent of approved doctor bills 
and that part of the program remains intact starting in 1989 
however the 75 deductible and the 20 percent share paid by 
beneficiaries counts toward the 1370 cap after that is reached 
medicare pays 100 percent of approved doctor bills 
however the beneficiary will remain liable for any portion of 
doctor bills that exceed the fees approved by medicare 
in a new benefit medicare will pay half of outpatient 
prescription drug costs in 1991 after a 600 deductible is met the 
government share rises to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in 
1993 however the deductible is expected to rise each year to keep 
pace with rising drug costs 
medicare now does not cover outpatient drugs except for a 
handful of very expensive ones such as antirejection medication 
for organ transplant recipients 
the socalled supplemental premium starts at 2250 a year for 
each 150 of income tax owed in 1989 climbing to an additional 42 
a year on each 150 of tax liability by 1993 there is an 800 cap 
on the supplemental premium in 1989 climbing to 1050 in 1993

house power brokers squared off wednesday in a 
showdown over a 28 billion longterm home health care program that 
bypassed committee scrutiny and under a special deal went 
straight to the floor 
the longterm home health care act sponsored by reps claude 
pepper dfla and edward roybal dcalif would expand medicare 
to cover longterm home services to the disabled and chronically 
ill of all ages an estimated 22 million people would qualify in 
1990 
reps dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee and john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee headed a drive to block 
consideration of the pepper bill they were irked that the measure 
did not go through their committees 
the bill stirred controversy from the moment the 87yearold 
pepper a wellknown advocate for the elderly said he wanted to 
attach it to another medicare expansion bill the catastrophic 
health initiative scheduled for final passage wednesday in the 
senate 
house leaders feared the weight of peppers plan would sink the 
catastrophic bill which is designed to cushion the financial blow 
of acute illness among the elderly so pepper agreed to withhold 
his measure in exchange for an assurance from house speaker jim 
wright dtexas that there would be a separate floor vote on 
peppers proposal 
as the vote to consider the bill neared republicans and 
democrats alike contended that house rules were being manipulated 
and members were being needlessly forced to vote on a popular but 
unexamined bill five months before an election 
the deliberate legislative process serves us well and 
ultimately saves us all from chaos rostenkowski said in a may 
31 letter to rep jamie whitten dmiss chairman of the house 
appropriations committee appealing for his help in defeating the 
pepper initiative 
i cannot remember a more serious violation of the house 
rules dingell said in a may 23 letter to all members of the 
house furthermore dingell wrote the bill does not pay for 
nursing home costs which are the major sources of financially 
devastating costs for the elderly 
pepper said he didnt include nursing home benefits because he 
wanted to keep the cost of his bill down the sponsor of the 
companion senate bill paul simon dill said 30 percent of 
people in nursing homes would not be there if home services were 
available 
the congressional budget office estimated the pepper program 
would cost 28 billion over five years it would be paid for by 
taxing income above 45000 a year which is now exempt from the 
medicare payroll tax 
cbo said the program would begin running a deficit after the 
fifth year under the bill benefits would be cut and beneficiaries 
charged a copayment to offset any shortfalls 
some house members told pepper they feared passage of his bill 
would undermine chances for developing a more comprehensive 
program including nursing home and home health care next year 
others said the program promised more than it could deliver 
because the agencies and services it required did not yet exist 
the reagan administration opposed the pepper bill and advisers 
to president reagan said they would recommend a veto if it reached 
his desk 
in a recent letter to house minority leader robert michel 
rill health and human services secretary otis r bowen said 
twothirds of the people who would qualify for home care services 
under the pepper bill now receive informal care from family and 
friends 
based on administration calculations bowen predicted the 
program would rack up a 9 billion deficit in 1990 and 26 billion 
by 2000 he said that would put a heavy burden on beneficiaries who 
would have to make up half the deficit through copayments 
among those fighting the pepper bill was the coordinating 
committee for longterm care policy a coalition of insurance and 
business groups that includes the american council of life 
insurance and the us chamber of commerce

a terrifying accident involving a boeing 737 
airplane has stunned the nations airline industry and challenged 
one of its bedrock tenets a 19yearold 737 operated by aloha 
airlines disintegrated during a flight over hawaii on april 28 
sweeping a flight attendant to her death and injuring 61 
passengers the pilots managed to land the plane safely 
the incident galvanized the industry and brought more than 350 
representatives from airlines aircraft manufacturers government 
agencies and aviation safety groups to washington early this month 
for a special conference where the safety of older planes was 
hotly debated 
the aloha disaster also focused attention on a longstanding 
fundamental rule of the industry aging planes have always been 
replaced on the basis of economic factors not safety 
considerations 
lower fuel prices in recent years for example have led 
airlines to hang onto older jetliners since they didnt have to be 
replaced by more fuelefficient aircraft 
the average age of us jetliners is 1253 years up a sharp 21 
percent from 1979 a year when oil shortages brought spiraling fuel 
prices more than half the 2767 jets operated by major us 
carriers are 16 years old or older according to avmark inc an 
aviation consulting firm in arlington va 
if planes are properly maintained we can fly them for an 
indefinite period said joe hopkins a spokesman for united 
airlines its really an economic decision as far as when you 
retire an airplane 
industry observers say recent orders for new aircraft provide 
pointed examples of the economic life rule 
united the nations largest carrier recently placed an order 
with boeing co for 60 new 757s 
no 2 american airlines ordered another 100 757s from boeing 
to replace its fleet of 33 737s acquired in its 1987 takeover of 
aircal inc as well as some of its own 727s 
the average age of the planes in uniteds existing fleet is 136 
years while americans aircraft average 100 years the new orders 
will bring uniteds average down to 116 by the end of this year 
and americans will fall to 94 
the purchases were huge even by jetliner order standards 
costing united and american together more than 4 billion 
the airlines say the purchases were under study long before the 
aloha accident and were based on such factors as reduced operating 
and maintenance costs but in the wake of the 737 mishap the 
pressure to update the nations commercial fleet grows ever 
stronger 
robert goodrich a top official of the federal aviation 
administration said at the washington conference that the agency 
will make a thorough review of inspection and maintenance programs 
for aging jetliners the agency said additional testing techniques 
would be developed to determine the lifespan of a jetliner 
several members of congress also have sounded the alarm rep 
dan glickman dkan for example suggested that the faa buy old 
planes and test them to determine when an aircraft no longer can be 
considered safe 
under the spotlight of such scrutiny the safety issue may begin 
to color the economics of fleet replacement as the costs of 
maintaining and insuring older planes surge and litigation by 
accident victims and their families mushrooms airlines may be 
forced to retire their aging craft sooner than anticipated 
when the economics of it demands a change the airlines will 
change said wendell gauthier a new orleans attorney who has 
represented plane crash victims 
the us commercial airline industry paid a total of 373 
million in insurance premiums in 1986 up sharply from 272 million 
in 1985 according to the air transport association a 
washingtonbased trade group figures for premiums paid on older 
planes arent available 
of the 1986 total the carriers paid 170 million in hull 
insurance covering damage to aircraft 158 million for passenger 
liability and 45 million for cargo insurance and other charges 
payments to accident victims and their survivors by airlines and 
aircraft manufacturers are also on the rise some insurance 
underwriters estimate that us carriers face potential liability 
of 125 million per seat on planes involved in crashes according 
to the national law journal a weekly newspaper published in new 
york 
the airlines insist that they are sticking to their traditional 
economic rules for putting old planes out to pasture 
the basic feeling toward operating old craft has not 
changed said pan am corp spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
certainly we have an open mind uniteds hopkins said but 
he insisted that the airline hasnt changed its policy of 
replacement decisions based on economics 
if the airlines do move to buy new aircraft they would trim 
their operating costs by burning less fuel and cutting maintenance 
expenses in addition new models like the 757 need only two pilots 
in the cockpit instead of the three in many older planes 
the costs of buying new jetliners can be daunting though 
especially for some us carriers that are financially strapped 
plagued by labor troubles and easy prey to be taken over by 
investors or competitors 
edward starkman an industry analyst for investment firm 
painewebber inc suggested that airlines might begin to operate 
their aging jets fewer hours each day the carriers also are likely 
to continue to emphasize maintenance and inspection of the older 
planes he said

eastern airlines pilots union says transportation 
secretary james burnley glossed over significant problems when 
he talked with reporters last week about a federal report on the 
companys safety practices 
in the report the federal aviation administration said its 
monthlong investigation determined that eastern was fit to fly 
our preliminary analysis of the report shows that the faa 
found significant problems at eastern which had been identified by 
eastern pilots previous to the investigation but which were either 
glossed over ignored or buried by mr burnley when he gave his 
interpretation of the report the air line pilots association 
said tuesday in a statement 
we strenuously object to the characterization of the report 
presented by mr burnley at his press conference the alpa said 
anyone who takes the trouble to read the full dot report will 
discover that the issues of concern are a far cry from those 
described by mr burnley 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said wednesday the safety 
problems alleged by the union are the same type that led to the 
federal investigation 
the faa has thoroughly examined eastern she said the faa 
and dot find eastern to be safe and were satisfied and pleased 
with that report 
these allegations are completely without merit 
in support of its statement the alpa cited specific safety 
deficiencies noted in the report among those listed by the union 
unairworthy aircraft were flown in 1987 
the maintenance budget is unproductively spent 
easterns ontime performance overrides maintenance 
considerations 
on average the dispatch system handles three times as many 
flights as is normal for such airlines 
the weather department was dismantled resulting in inadequate 
weather information to pilots 
however the union reiterated that eastern is safe because of 
the professionalism of its pilots

lower wednesday on the chicago board of trade as isolated showers 
brought relief to parched cropland in parts of the midwest 
but oat futures advanced strongly because the rain missed the 
northern tier of states which produce most of the countrys oat 
crop analysts said 
soybean futures which have climbed to fouryear highs on fears 
of drought damage posted their steepest decline in two weeks as 
bands of showers moved from iowa into illinois and missouri 
but nobody was declaring an end to the dry weather or to the 
bull market for grains and soybeans 
the overall droughttype conditions still appear to be 
intact said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
this market has had explosive price action in response to 
drought conditions he said whenever you get into a situation 
like that the first sign of any potential relief brings a lot of 
reaction from the market with a lot of profittaking 
at the close wheat was 6 cents to 10 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 370 a bushel corn was 7 cents 
to 9 cents lower with july at 248 a bushel oats were 7 cents to 
12 cents higher with july at 234 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents 
to 25 cents lower with july at 862 a bushel

france will forgive a third of its loans to the 
worlds poorest nations and is urging other big industrial powers 
to take similar action the presidents office said wednesday 
the plan would not apply to the worlds most indebted developing 
nations such as brazil and mexico because they are not among the 
poorest although france believes ways also must be found to help 
them a spokesman said 
the spokesman declined to put a value on the forgiven debts 
in a related development west germany announced wednesday that 
it would forgive about 50 million in debts owed by five african 
nations 
french president francois mitterrand set out his proposal in a 
letter sent monday to the six other leaders attending the economic 
summit june 1921 special counselor jacques attali told reporters 
it has never been so urgent and so necessary to act to help 
the countries of the third world while the gap between rich 
countries and poor countries continues to grow mitterrand wrote 
according to excerpts made public by his office 
mitterrand president reagan and the leaders of canada britain 
west germany italy and japan are planning to attend the annual 
threeday meeting in toronto 
in bonn west germany a government source said chancellor 
helmut kohl also planned to present summit participants with a 
proposal for reducing the debt burden of the poorest nations 
france is proposing that the seven nations agree to take one of 
three approaches 
forgive onethird of the total public or governmentguaranteed 
commercial debt with the rest consolidated at normal market terms 
consolidate existing debt at market rates of interest but 
extend repayments over 25 years rather than the current norm of 20 
years 
consolidate the debt at a preferential interest rate of no more 
than half the market rate but with repayments over about 15 years 
its a very new procedure attali said with its menu of 
options it gives us reason to hope for a consensus 
whether or not the summit partners agree france intends to go 
ahead with the first option wiping out onethird of the debt 
attali said 
he refused to specify how much money was involved beyond saying 
the amount is not just in the hundreds of millions of francs 
at current exchange rates 100 million francs is about 172 
million 
attali declined to identify the countries that would be 
eligible saying only that they numbered about 20 to qualify a 
nation must be extremely poor deeply in debt and in the process of 
improving the management of its economy he said 
in bonn the governments chief spokesman friedhelm ost told 
reporters that west germany had forgiven debts totaling 86 million 
marks or about 505 million owed by the central african 
republic togo guinea sierra leone and sudan 
ost said the govenment was considering the possibility of 
extending partial debt forgiveness to other poor countries

the stock market staged a strong advance today 
reviving its recent rally with a boost from declining interest 
rates 
trading was heavy inflated in part by maneuvers involving the 
impending dividends of highyielding stocks 
in the credit markets prices of longterm government bonds 
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates rose 
about 10 for each 1000 in face value 
that more than recouped losses suffered tuesday and brokers 
said it provided reassurance to investors who have been wary about 
the chances for a significant decline in interest rates 
also commodity prices which had been moving up steadily of 
late turned downward bringing at least a respite from inflation

fear not all you who have botched a batch 
of laundry with an overdose of bleach now a little dash can 
breathe new life into your wardrobe 
a texas clothing company is marketing a line of apparel that can 
change color with controlled amounts of liquid bleach and cold 
water 
that might not sound so new after all just about any fabric 
will fade when it is bleached but with the colormagic process 
cloth changes from teal blue to peach from royal blue to hot pink 
or from violet to orange among other combinations 
i think the possibilities are unlimited said tom ahmann 
executive vice president of el pasobased greater texas finishing 
corp which dyes and markets the line of clothes its so 
different from whats been offered before 
if colormagic takes off it would mark the second time that 
greater texas caught the beginning of a clothing fad the 
corporation was one of the first to offer acidwashing for 
companies that make denim clothing 
the colormagic process was invented by owen sercus a textile 
chemist at the fashion institute of technology in new york and 
greater texas is the sole manufacturer 
there are two basic ways to change the color of the garments 
first the color of the entire garment can be changed by tossing it 
in a coldwater wash cycle with a specific amount of liquid bleach 
colors usually can be changed twice for example from hot pink to 
apricot to cantaloupe 
the colorchanging can even be done in the same wash with other 
clothes because the dye dissolves and is not absorbed by other 
clothes in the washer greater texas officials say 
the garments which now are made only in girls and junior 
sizes also can become canvases for people who want to personalize 
their own clothes in a process that could be likened to reverse 
tiedyeing people can use paint brushes or cotton swabs to brush 
or draw designs onto the fabric with diluted liquid bleach 
after the designs are drawn the garment is dried thoroughly 
then washed in cold water to remove the bleach the designs are the 
color of the underlying fabric 
ahmann said wednesday he thinks the clothes will be a hit 
because consumers are looking for more and more individuality in 
their clothes with something like this they can get it 
the colormagic line consists of jean jackets hats socks 
jeans tshirts belts walking shorts and camp shirts and is 
available at five stores nationwide bloomingdales in new york 
marshallfields in chicago macys in san francisco highbees in 
cleveland and the popular in el paso 
ahmann said the line will be expanded later to adult sizes and 
might be offered in more stores once manufacturing capacity 
increases the clothes are not cheap jeans cost 48 tshirts are 
19 and socks are 10 a pair

the senate bowed to president reagan on 
wednesday and sustained his veto of a massive trade bill but 
supporters executed a lastminute maneuver designed to keep the 
measure alive 
the vote was 6137 with 10 republicans abandoning the white 
house and supporting override of the measure which would overhaul 
procedures under which the government imposes import curbs to 
assist us industries and retaliate against international trade 
violations 
just two democrats voted to sustain reagans second veto of a 
major trade bill in three years 
this controversy with the president is not about trade it is 
not even about economics it is about politics sen pete v 
domenici rnm told the senate he hailed burgeoning us 
exports and improved trade figures 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas a 
cosponsor said however theyll be rejoicing in japan theyll 
be popping champagne corks in germany as a result of the action 
the vote was five short of the twothirds majority needed to 
override the veto by reagan who had objected to the provisions in 
the bill that included plant closings notification and restrictions 
on alaskan oil exports 
republican critics of the defeated measure blasted its 
specialinterest provisions and said protectionist provisions had 
not been fully removed 
but supporters in both parties said the 1000page bill was 
vitally needed by farmers and heavy industries feeling harsh trade 
pressures 
the senates action was accompanied by renewed calls for a more 
moderate version that reagan could sign before the november 
election 
sen majority leader robert c byrd dwva raised the 
possibility however that such a strippeddown trade measure might 
become hopelessly entangled in the senates complex procedures he 
said that would force a choice between the bill reagan vetoed or no 
bill 
byrd voted against the measure in a parliamentary move that 
would allow him to bring the bill back again he said he hoped 
constituents would pressure their senators to revive the measure 
before congress adjourns for the fall election campaign 
he said his parliamentary ploy was insurance that the american 
people can still get a trade bill this year 
reagan issued a statement saying he was pleased by the vote 
as i said in my veto message on the bill i am committed to 
enactment of a responsible trade bill this year the president 
said i am directing my senior advisors to stand ready to assist 
the congressional leadership on a new trade bill one that will 
strengthen americas international competitiveness and create even 
more new jobs for americans 
there also were pointed reminders from both republican and 
democratic lawmakers that reagans supporters on the issue could 
come under political attack for opposing the bill with its 
provision to require notice to employees of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs 
we may lose the battle but weve won the war on this issue 
sen max baucus dmont said this is no longer an issue 
between the congress and the white house it is now a presidential 
campaign issue governor michael dukakis stands by working men 
and women who deserve notice of plant closings 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan conceded there were no 
assurances that a revised bill could win approval this year he did 
say it can be done if the leaders in the senate and the leaders 
in the house will agree with the administration and then agree to 
no more amendments 
dole told the senate the bill should get a more critical look 
because it fails the truth in advertising test 
far from being devoted to opening global markets for american 
goods dole said the measure represents a grabbag of provisions 
of questionable merit he cited measures to allow in dutyfree 
ethanol and aid major banks stuck with billions of dollars in third 
world debt 
supporters of the measure continued to view a provision calling 
for advance notice of plant closings as their most powerful 
political weapon 
if you support the president you will be turning your back on 
american workers when they are most in need said sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio youll be siding with highpriced corporate 
lobbyists and fatcat business executives who are protected by 
golden parachutes 
the 1000page document produced by a housesenate conference 
committee won 6336 senate approval on april 27 
reagan vetoed the measure may 24 focusing his criticism on the 
plantclosings provision which would require companies with 100 
employees or more to provide them with 60day notice of closings 
and largescale layoffs reagan said it would rob managers of the 
flexibility needed to keep their businesses in peak economic health 
reagan also was critical of an array of other provisions 
including what he described as overly stringent restrictions on 
alaskan oil exports 
but the house quickly overrode his veto 308113 that left it 
up to the senate whether to enact the bill over the presidents 
veto 
the bill also would have boosted by 1 billion payments to grain 
companies to export us crops and furnish both farmers and the 
advertising industry with additional subsidies to stimulate 
overseas sales of american agricultural commodities the windfall 
profits tax on oil companies would be repealed under the measure 
the measure also would make it more difficult for prosecutors to 
convict us business executives of complicity in payoffs to 
foreign officials thats why i call it the bringbackbribery 
bill said retiring sen william proxmire dwis its lone 
democratic critic 
sen ted stevens ralaska was sharply critical of restrictions 
on alaskan oil exports one would permit shipment to canada of 
50000 barrels of crude daily but require that the petroleum be 
taken first to a port in the lower 48 states the other would limit 
export of products from new refineries to 70000 barrels a day and 
half of output

mexico the worlds sixth largest oil 
producer last month trimmed the average price of its light isthmus 
crude to us clients the government oil monopoly said wednesday 
night 
pemex said in a statement that it charged us customers an 
average of 1578 for a 42gallon barrel in may down from the 16 
of april 
the average price of heavy maya oil rose from 1277 a barrel in 
april to 1307 in may the statement said 
the isthmus and mayaquality crudes that mexico exported 
during the month of may to the american continent had a light 
variation in their quotations with respect to april due to the 
linkage of the prices of mexican oil with the prevailing ones in 
the international market pemex said 
prices for japanese buyers were held steady in may at 1530 a 
barrel for the light oil and 1260 a barrel for the heavy brand 
european customers paid less last month pemex said those 
clients were charged on average 1499 a barrel for isthmus crude 
during the first 15 days of may and 1215 for the maya quality in 
april the average cost for europe was 1543 a barrel for isthmus 
and 1251 for maya 
pemex said mexico exported an average of 1357 million barrels a 
day in may with us buyers taking 51 percent of the total 
spain bought 21 percent of the total and japan was the third 
largest buyer with a 15 percent share 
mexico is not a member of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries a 13member cartel but it monitors its 
decisions closely and often follows its guidelines on pricing and 
production 
opec members are scheduled to hold their regular midyear 
meeting in vienna austria on saturday they are expected to focus 
their attention on whether to overhaul production quotas 
mexico and five other noncartel nations earlier this year held 
talks with opec about reducing output in an effort to bolster 
sagging world prices 
mexico which has a foreign debt of about 100 billion relies 
on its oil sales to help keep current on its loan payments and buy 
needed imports for its developing economy 
president miguel de la madrid has in recent years pushed to 
reduce the nations dependence on crude exports and build up sales 
of nonoil goods to foreign buyers
