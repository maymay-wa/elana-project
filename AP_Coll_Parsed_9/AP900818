polystyrene along with aluminum cans newspapers and glass 
bottles he said we sure would like that

the voice of the baghdad radio announcer 
boomed onto the airwaves in fractured english addressing us 
soldiers do you want to go back home from the arabian desert 
psychologically broken 
iraqs new englishlanguage program broadcast on shortwave 
radio stepped up the antiamerican rhetoric its arabic media 
services have waged for weeks 
taking a cue from broadcasters such as tokyo rose and axis sally 
during world war ii and hanoi hannah in the vietnam war the 
programs featured an eclectic mix of news music and mockery meant 
to demoralize soldiers rushed in to saudi arabia since the aug 2 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
during the hourlong program the broadcaster asked remember 
what the petrol emirs are doing to american girls do you want to 
defend them 
in addition to alleging immoral gulf emirs had enjoyed the 
company of us women the broadcast mentioned faraway loved ones 
desert heat quicksand rising taxes in the united states war 
injuries and us soldiers missing in action in vietnam 
the brief messages were interspersed with music 
about 30 seconds of big band swing tunes that tokyo rose herself 
might have used was followed by 
to the american soldier in the saudi arabia desert would you 
like to be one of the cripples who are only lamented in the charity 
ceremonies do you want to go back home from the arabian desert and 
you are psychologically broken 
then would come some taped middleoftheroad music that seemed 
more appropriate in elevators or a few bars from one of lebanons 
westernized composers 
there were also special reports one listed proiraqi 
demonstrations disrupting world capitals another was a tirade 
against kuwait and the united arab emirates for trying to destroy 
the iraqi economy this year by overproducing oil and driving down 
prices 
a third analyzed the objective of the united states in sending 
up to 250000 troops to saudi arabia claiming the main purpose was 
occupation the bush administration has said the troops were there 
for defensive purposes 
talk radio it wasnt the format was heavy with long sentences 
and standard phrases that are the hallmarks of antiamerican 
rhetoric in the arab region 
lines such as imposing american zionist schemes on the arab 
nation were unlikely to win the hearts and minds of many us 
enlisted men 
it could not be immediately confirmed that the programs were 
monitored by the troops in saudi arabia 
the male broadcastor speaking in britishaccented english made 
most of his appeals in the form of questions 
to the american soldier in the saudi arabia desert how do you 
fight against iraq and you know that there are more than 200 
churches in it do you want to kill a christian like you and to be 
killed by him will you be pleased to be ended like this 
with the us buildup the largest since the united states pulled 
out of vietnam in 1975 that war was an inevitable topic 
to the american soldier in the saudi arabia desert ask your 
friends about what had happened in vietnam the american soldiers 
corpses are still lost in vietnam after they had been eaten by 
worms 
and the harsh conditions were also stressed why do you come 
to the burning desert the broadcaster asked another time he 
said didnt you hear the sand dunes in the saudi arabian desert 
are moving and they swallowed many people and they will swallow 
you 
it added also guys the islamic organization in colorado has 
condemned the invasion 
mentioning home states was a favorite of similar broadcasts 
during world war ii and the korean war 
back then many of the us troops did not get broadcast news 
from home for days 
sexy female voices and the playing of american top 20 records 
were meant to get the troops grumbling about the war and missing 
home 
germany used axis sally to say things like hello gang throw 
down those little old guns and toddle off home theres no getting 
the germans down 
lord hawhaw a britishamerican citizen was another 
broadcaster who made similar statements beamed toward london he 
was executed for treason while japans tokyo rose and axis sally 
received prison terms of 10 to 12 years

a symbolic arab force being created to help 
protect saudi arabia from its hostile neighbor iraq pales beside 
the massive fighting machine the united states is sending 
the contributions of egypt syria and morocco will be relatively 
small at best and it is hard to pin down just what those countries 
are sending 
the main significance of the force appears to be that it enables 
the saudis to justify the american presence by telling arabs leery 
of foreigners that brother arabs have also come to their rescue 
president hosni mubarak of egypt architect of the arab league 
resolution that brought about the arab commitment says syria and 
morocco will join egypt in sending troops moslem but nonarab 
pakistan and bangladesh say they will also send troops 
the force will be a few thousand at most insignificant as a 
military threat to 160000 iraqis massed with tanks on the saudi 
border 
we are sending not more than 2000 soldiers to help the 
saudis under the command of the saudi arabian armed forces 
mubarak told reporters at alexandria i dont compare our forces 
with the us forces 
the pentagon on washington has said the united states force 
might eventually reach 250000 if necessary 
little has been said officially about the moroccan and syrian 
forces which sources in the persian gulf area have said would 
total about 5000 men each 
official sources in rabat said morocco has dispatched 1200 
soldiers so far 
syrian officials have said nothing about the their force saudi 
diplomats reported earlier in the week that syrian soldiers had 
arrived but col andrew duncan of the londonbased international 
institute of strategic studies said he understands they amount to 
nothing more than a planeload of staff officers 
duncan added that the arab force appears to include the wrong 
kind of soldier needed to face saddam husseins strike forces 
the sort of forces coming in really arent the best things to 
use in armored warfare in the desert duncan said by telephone 
once elite paratroopers make their marvelous parachute drop they 
dont have much more they can do against tanks 
egyptian defense ministry sources have said egypt is sending 
commandos paratroops chemicalwarfare specialists and infantrymen 
the defense ministry has not said how many soldiers are going 
in a statement friday its first on the deployment the ministry 
said elements of the egyptian armed forces left the homeland 
and have arrived in the areas of operation assigned to them in 
saudi arabia 
on aug 10 mubarak pushed through an arab league summit 
conference the resolution establishing the joint force the idea 
purportedly was to help saudi arabia defend itself if iraq invades 
via kuwait which it seized on aug 2 
the resolution also gave arab approval to the saudis request 
for us help for saudi arabias usarmed 123000man military 
complaints from arabs began as soon as the invitation was 
announced feelings on the subject run so high that mubaraks 
resolution passed at the arab summit by a bare majority twelve of 
the 20 leaders attending voting yes 
six of the 12 including saudi arabia and kuwaits ousted 
government were gulf states concerned about iraqi expansion 
military analyst duncan said even a 15000man arab force would 
be still token especially if youre only talking about men they 
would need something to fight with other than rifles and machine 
guns

both american troops and their saudi allies 
are experiencing some culture shock these days 
the most obvious surprise for the saudi forces has been the 
presence of women in the us military particularly the air force 
a group of saudi airmen stood in stunned silence the other day 
as an american woman working a supply line in the tripledigit heat 
took off her uniform shirt to work in her tshirt she was asked to 
put her full uniform back on 
an air force captain assigned to an awacs plane said she often 
finds saudi airmen assigned to the crews staring at her 
they seem shocked at first but theyre extremely polite and i 
think theyre getting used to it the north carolina native said 
it must be a strange sight for them 
meanwhile us forces are in a country where alcohol is 
illegal shorts are considered offensive and virtually all activity 
grinds to a halt five times a day for prayers even saudi soldiers 
some of whom are working side by side with americans stop for 
prayers 
for now as they are briefed on saudi and muslim customs and try 
to get accustomed to the searing heat americans troops are not 
being allowed to make recreation trips into saudi cities although 
some are housed temporarily at local hotels 
the saudis have been extraordinarily gracious hosts even as 
they are occasionally taken aback by the ways of their allies but 
both saudi and american officials say there likely will be at least 
a few incidents if the us military presence here is a prolonged 
one 
when you have two cultures that are so different so 
fundamentally different there are bound to be some conflicts a 
saudi government minister said this week but we are confident 
that we can keep them to a minimum 
the culture clash comes at an already stressful period of saudi 
history the oil boom took arabia out of obscurity and the past two 
decades have brought an incredible development boom in major oil 
and urban areas the saudis are reaching out to the west for help 
in development and business while at the same time fighting to 
maintain their strict religious traditions 
to help keep the balance the saudis have tight restrictions on 
foreigners only those with work contracts are allowed into the 
country and almost all of them live in wallringed compounds 
suddenly thousands more americans are on saudi soil most of 
them young and unfamiliar with arab and saudi traditions 
the us military is taking a number of steps designed to keep 
saudiamerican interaction military actions excepted to a 
minimum troops interviewed this week seem to understand although 
theyre not always happy about it 
the guys sure would like a cold one an air force captain 
said thursday from the sundrenched tarmac of a saudi air base 
tell the folks back home to send in the budweiser plane an 
army tank gunner said earlier in the week 
some of the misunderstandings are innocent but to the saudis 
offensive several saudi military officials were sitting with us 
troops early in the week when the americans served field rations 
for lunch two pork dishes were among the choices offered muslims 
do not eat pork 
the greatest cultural adjustment revolves around the presence of 
hundreds of us military women here for operation desert shield 
while the coed us military forces banter about saudi men and 
women rarely interact in public beyond quiet conversation most 
saudi women wear anklelength black robes covering their heads and 
usually their faces with black headdresses and veils 
saudis consider it offensive for women to wear pants 
particularly shorts or blue jeans and saudi women will hiss at 
women they consider dressed inappropriately the women in the us 
military contingent have been advised to wear the robes abayas 
when they venture out in public 
i think it would be too risky to go downtown without it a 
21yearold female air force senior airman from mount clemens 
mich said thursday im not going to take any chances 
its unclear when the us forces will be able to wander about 
in saudi cities officers from each of the services said this week 
some recreational activities will have to be planned if the stay 
here drags on much longer and there is every indication that it 
will 
we are guests of the saudis and we need to be aware of their 
cultural concerns said air force col john mcbroom well 
brief them american troops and tell them what to do and not to do 
and if they dont do it right well send them home its that 
simple 
americans have been on saudi soil since the 1930s when an 
expedition drilling for water struck oil triggering arabias 
interaction with the western world 
i think we saudis always because of the oil find have 
associated americans with our good fortune a saudi government 
official said over lunch this week we are very different but we 
have a positive bond

with seven iraqi divisions in kuwait and another 
24 near the iraqsaudi border european and israeli military 
analysts say a usled military operation to liberate kuwait would 
be outnumbered and outgunned 
the best option for the moment the experts say is to go on 
barricading the ports of iraq and its friends 
they say the forces now assembling in saudi arabia should dig 
in trust their superior weapons to deter further iraqi aggression 
and wait for iraq to make the first move 
but the problem is tension is growing because iraq is now able 
to move more forces across the border said paul beaver 
publisher of janes defense weekly 
the risk of escalation is there because there are going to be 
so many forces in saudi most of whom cant talk to the other 
usually a recipe for disaster he said in an interview thursday 
according to janes latest estimates iraq has seven divisions 
in kuwait and 24 on the iraqisaudi border were talking of them 
having available now south of baghdad 400000 soldiers beaver 
said 
with a flight landing in saudi arabia every seven minutes the 
us military force is approaching 50000 janes estimates 
but col andrew duncan of the international institute of 
strategic studies estimated it would take a sixmonth buildup of 
us forces to be strong enough to oust the iraqis from kuwait 
he said the americans currently have only a few old light 
sheridan tanks in saudi arabia and would need heavy armor for any 
serious push 
i would say its pie in the sky to say theres any military 
option to invade kuwait duncan said the united states would 
have less than one mechanized division there by september and 
would need at least five to push the iraqis out and keep them out 
he said 
francis tusa european editor of armed forces journal 
international said another question was whether the saudis would 
allow 250000 or 300000 us troops on their soil given the 
opposition of many arabs to the american presence in the middle 
east 
i would hang back i would let the iraqis make the first move 
and let them make a serious move he said the iraqis 
politically speaking have to do something pretty flagrant and 
massive before the arabs will be happy with a us response 
dore gold a senior analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies said the main american option would 
be a massive air attack on the iraqi military infrastructure 
but most do not believe that you can use the air force to 
force ground troops to retreat he said 
beaver said many military strategists believe air attacks 
against economic targets like power stations and desalination 
plants would work 
but the ramifications are at present far too fraught for the 
americans to contemplate he said 
ian anthony a researcher at the stockholm international peace 
research institute said the us air force could also hit 
strategic targets like highways that channel supplies from jordan 
to iraq 
but neither side is eager to escalate the conflict he said 
because for either side now the next step is likely to have 
extremely serious consequences 
dore said another reason for holding off on action now is that 
both sides believe time is on their side 
the us believes that the sanctions against iraq will be felt 
in several months while iraq feels that the larger mercantile 
international system will start to cheat in a few months time and 
the enthusiastic arab national support for saddam hussein will 
eventually undermine economic sanctions he said 
the one thing the multinational force can do is effectively 
blockade ports beaver said 
that means mersin in southern turkey aqaba in jordan and of 
course the neck of the gulf or the straits of hormuz to prevent 
iraqi traffic going in and out he said 
but beaver added that iraqs sudden decision to settle the 
eightyear war with iran could rupture the stranglehold if tehran 
opens its border with iraq

the spirit of albert schweitzer has 
found an unlikely home on a quiet street in connecticut thousands 
of miles from the african village where the late theologian 
philosopher and doctor spent much of his life as a medical 
missionary 
inside the albert schweitzer memorial foundation large black 
and white portraits of the nobel peace prizewinner stare down from 
the walls interspersed with printed quotations from his work 
relics of his life crowd the firstfloor rooms of the small 
house including busts of schweitzer with his craggy mustachioed 
face and a book the great humanitarian inscribed to maria 
lagendijk the dutch nurse who worked with him at his hospital in 
lambarene a small village in the west african country of gabon 
you know how as young people you always find a hero a star 
you can cling to thats exactly how it was for me said harold 
robles the foundations director recalling the time when he 
learned of schweitzer as a boy in a classroom in rotterdam holland 
robles an international telemarketing executive who moved to 
the united states in 1981 turned his lifelong fascination with 
schweitzer into a public monument when he established the 
foundation in 1983 
his collection today is used by schweitzer scholars from around 
the world 
but robles said his greatest contribution to schweitzers memory 
will occur in new york thursday with the start of the twoday 
international albert schweitzer colloquium at the united nations 
robles spent 2 years organizing the colloquium timed for the 25th 
anniversary of schweitzers death on sept 4 1965 at the age of 
90 
such renowned figures as noble peace prize winners oscar arias 
sanchez elie wiesel and linus pauling will speak on the 
relevance of albert schweitzer at the dawn of the 21st century 
rhena schweitzer miller schweitzers daughter is serving as an 
honorary chairwoman 
she said the gathering which already has attracted nearly 700 
people will help people see the continuing relevance of her 
fathers philosophy 
he talked about many things before his time she said 
reciting his interest in such contemporary issues as the 
environment and nuclear war 
because of the west african hospital he designed and built in 
1913 schweitzer is known to most people as a famous doctor robles 
said he spent most of his life in the remote village establishing 
a leper colony and a large general practice 
but schweitzer had numerous other accomplishments that are less 
widely known his book the quest of the historical jesus 
influenced a generation of theologians a gifted musician 
schweitzer wrote a groundbreaking biography of johann sebastian 
bach in 1905 and published bachs complete organ works because he 
also was an organist 
but in his own mind schweitzer seems to have thought of himself 
first and foremost as a philosopher said robles 
in a quotation robles is particularly fond of schweitzer said 
when you portray me it should not be as the doctor who ministers 
to the sick it is my philosophy of reverence for life that i 
consider my primary contribution to the world 
robles first wrote to his hero when he was 8 schweitzer wrote 
back telling him to study hard and finish his schoolwork before 
making any great plans to come to africa 
robles continued to write to the hospital beginning what was to 
be a lifelong correspondence with lagendijk the nurse who was 
working with schweitzer in africa the woman would write on 
schweitzers behalf and pass on requests from the young boy 
when schweitzer visited rotterdam when robles was 11 lagendijk 
made sure the boy was on the list of those to meet him 
robles said people always are amazed by the fact that he 
remembers little of this one facetoface encounter he had with his 
hero 
the way i met schweitzer and the way i admire him and came to 
know him is through his books robles said i read him over and 
over and over again and that is how i met the man

if a guy cant hit it off with those 
sunbaked southern california females who like to play in the surf 
he can always go back to san francisco and sit on the dock of the 
bay 
especially if hes a sea lion 
last year hundreds of squatters with fish breath descended on a 
dock near the citys famed fishermans wharf tourist attraction and 
made themselves at home now many are back 
the 100 or so sea lions on pier 39 are just a bunch of really 
lonely guys said ann maurer of the california marine mammal 
center in marin county they are young males that couldnt 
establish themselves with females during the mating season in the 
channel islands off santa barbara she said 
except for a lack of sea lionesses the pier is everything a 
sea lion could ask for maurer said as far as the sea lions 
are concerned k dock is just another strip of beach with plenty of 
sun and a lot of fish just over the side 
their choice of residence brings them in close contact with 
humans many who have never seen the lumbering ocean mammals 
outside a zoo 
the barking sometimes pushy sea lions are protected under the 
federal marine mammals protective act and may not be harassed 
hunted captured or killed 
about 300 of the animals that can weigh up to 800 pounds took up 
residence on pier 39 last year with most departing by spring they 
began returning last weekend peigin barrett executive director of 
the marine center said friday they come and go with the fishing 
and breeding seasons she said whats unusual is to see them 
in one place and so close to humans they are only about eight feet 
away with just a railing separating them from people 
business owners for pier 39 which contains tourist shops and 
amusement arcades called the marine center for help when sea lions 
started congregating at the dock last year neighbors complained 
about all the noise from the animals barrett said 
ultimately the sea lions were simply left alone the pugnacious 
critters are not intimidated by the boat people who normally 
inhabit the 20 or so berths on the dock the harbors managers 
moved the boats for the duration of their seasonal visit 
we give them that dock when they show up move out boats to 
other docks said pier 39 spokeswoman alicia vargas its live 
and let live and as long as weve got the space to spare theyre 
welcome to it besides theyre kind of cute and the tourists like 
them 
barrett said the sea lion invasion can teach people more about 
sea life 
people get a close look at the sea lions it is very 
educational she said there were several sea lions that had 
fishing debris around their necks and the public could see the 
damage caused by carelessness 
the current complement is likely to stay until springtime then 
try their luck again next year in mating competition on the islands 
get used to it barrett said as far as the sea lions are 
concerned pier 39 is home

the energy departments delay in announcing 
its revised cost of the superconducting super collider amid reports 
of a 3 billion jump confirms that the atomsmasher project is 
way out of control a congressional critic charges 
the announcement had been expected friday but the energy 
department said the four groups making the estimates are still 
working out differences the revised figure would be ready by sept 
7 the department said 
in a letter to rep robert roe dnj chairman of the house 
science space and technology committee deputy energy secretary 
henson moore said the reconciliation process is still under 
way he gave no more explanation 
on july 25 moore said the four groups would try to have a final 
figure aug 17 
preliminary estimates of three of the groups were around 8 
billion a fourth estimate prepared by a group under doe contract 
but acting independently is between 115 billion and 117 
billion the newsletter inside energy reported the department has 
not confirmed the estimate 
usually only three groups of estimators work on doe projects 
the previous highest figure 86 billion was made last month 
by the group of scientists that redesigned the collider for a 
nearly a year doe planners have said it would cost about 8 
billion when first proposed in the mid1980s the collider was 
estimated to cost 44 billion 
delaying reports and rising costs confirm the suspicion this 
project is way out of control and very likely to run into serious 
budgetary questions said rep dennis eckart dohio a leading 
opponent of the new machine 
i grow more confident each day the collider wont survive 
he said 
the spiraling cost has been one of the main arguments eckart and 
other congressional opponents have used against the atom smasher 
to be built south of dallas 
congress has appropriated 318 million including funds to start 
construction for next year but that could be jeopardized because 
of the higher estimate eckart said 
given the ineptitude in giving us accurate cost estimates and 
facing a real budget summit that will make major cuts across 
the board the ssc may have just priced itself out of existence 
he said 
with the 8 billion figure in mind the house in may capped the 
colliders federal funds at 5 billion for the next five years 
texas has pledged 1 billion the rest is expected to come from 
foreign investors and other sources 
the three preliminary estimates agreed on the costs of building 
the 54mile tunnel and the superconducting magnets they varied in 
the cost of potential delays 
the independent group says the collider alone will cost 97 
billion and that detectors the giant microscopes that record 
atomic collisions will cost another 2 billion inside energy 
reported moore told the newsletter the group may have thought more 
detectors are needed 
but members of the texas delegation said the colliders funding 
would remain intact through the budget summit sens lloyd bentsen 
a democrat and phil gramm a republican are among the budget 
negotiators 
i dont even believe thats in question said rep steve 
bartlett rdallas 
i have every confidence the ssc will be built on time and 
within budget ive heard nothing that makes me doubt the budget 
weve already got for it

a 1976 legal brief signed by supreme court 
nominee david h souter argues against an unlimited constitutional 
right of individuals to possess firearms says a group seeking 
stricter regulation of handguns 
the second amendment does not create any right in us 
citizens to possess any and all weapons regardless of state 
regulation but rather concerns only authority of the states to 
keep and raise militias said the brief released friday by the 
washingtonbased center to prevent handgun violence 
the brief defended new hampshires concealedweapons law 
souters brief directly contradicts the national rifle 
associations position that the constitutions second 
amendment guarantees individuals an absolute right to own and 
possess guns of all types said barbara lautman executive 
director of the center 
an nra spokeswoman said the organization could not respond 
before seeing the brief 
souter was new hampshires attorney general when the brief was 
filed in the state supreme court it was signed by both souter and 
attorney richard b mcnamara and whether souter actually wrote the 
brief could not be determined immediately 
the brief urged the state court to reject the appeal of a man 
stephen sanne who had been convicted of carrying two loaded guns 
without a permit sanne argued that the conviction violated his 
constitutional rights 
the nations highest court which has not issued a ruling on the 
issue in decades never has decided specifically just what the 
second amendment protects 
the amendment says a well regulated militia being necessary 
to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep 
and bear arms shall not be infringed

usair must let 8000 employees vote again on 
whether to be represented by the teamsters union because the first 
organizing drive was tainted by illegal antiunion activities a 
federal labor board says 
the teamsters had lost their bid to represent workers in a 
ballot count announced in january but the national mediation board 
ruled friday that actions by the airline interfered with the 
unions organizing campaign 
the union may request a rerun election within 30 days 
the teamsters who were trying to win the right to represent 
8000 workers who load airplanes at 180 airports around the 
country had charged that usair unfairly interfered with their 
organizing drive 
the union said usair managers called meetings with small groups 
of workers to discuss the unions campaign put up antiteamsters 
posters urging workers to burn their ballots and produced two 
antiteamsters videotapes 
the carrier through the totality of its conduct has tainted 
the laboratory conditions for a fair election the ruling said 
remedial action must be taken 
the board created in 1934 mediates disputes involving 
railroads and airlines 
were extremely disappointed said david shipley a usair 
spokesman as far as were concerned we ran a perfectly legal 
election campaign 
a teamsters union official said no one was immediately available 
to comment on the ruling 
another election means an allornothing event for the 
teamsters who already represent some 1800 usair workers in 
pittsburgh philadelphia buffalo and boston if the union loses 
again those workers would no longer be teamsters members 
the teamsters had represented cargo workers at usair before its 
1989 merger with piedmont airlines whose employees were not 
members of the union 
last december the mediation board ordered the election to 
determine whether workers at usair and former piedmont employees 
would be represented by the teamsters three other unions 
representing pilots flight attendants and mechanics at usair 
gained the right to represent the piedmont workers without 
elections 
there were 8002 workers eligible to vote and under the boards 
rules the teamsters needed at least half of those workers to mail 
in ballots in the unions favor only 2371 workers mailed their 
ballots in favor of the teamsters with most of the workers not 
bothering to vote 
usair is based in arlington va

florida state university will become the 
national center of highmagnetic field research after edging out 
the massachusetts institute of technology in a competition for 
federal funds 
the selection friday of fsu by the national science foundation 
will make the tallahasseebased institution eligible for a grant of 
up to 60 million over five years 
depending on the availability of federal funds fsu could 
receive up to 18 million in the next 12 months to build a 
laboratory with powerful magnets creating unprecedented magnetic 
field strengths physicist jack e crow will direct the science at 
the laboratory which is expected to be in operation within three 
years 
research related to production and use of magnetic fields can 
lead to new devices for the computer industry new materials with 
exceptional strengths and major advances in medicine europe and 
japan have made strides in such research while us capabilities 
have lagged 
david a sanchez an assistant director of the foundation said 
florida state showed a greater commitment to creating a national 
center of excellence even though mit currently has a stronger 
faculty 
sanchez said fsu has pledged to create slots for 54 people 
including tenured faculty visiting faculty and visiting 
researchers by contrast he said mit had no recruitment plan for 
faculty which he said was critical since the major scientific 
figures at mit are near retirement 
florida state and mit were the finalists in a competition that 
involved an unspecified number of universities the facility will 
be called the national high magnetic field laboratory 
the state of florida will commit 58 million for the facility in 
tallahassee over five years fsu is joining with the university of 
florida and los alamos national laboratory in new mexico a leader 
in the area of pulsed magnetic technology 
qualified scientists and engineers from across the nation and 
around the world will be able to make use of the laboratory which 
will have from eight to 10 magnets 
mit originally had proposed to build the lab for 68 million 
sanchez said it proposed to meet the 8 million reduction by 
eliminating several magnet developments and reducing the faculty 
support 
fsu he said would have met the reduced funding by eliminating 
several projects extending the timetable for several of the 
proposed magnets but not reducing faculty commitment

the sign outside the fairground proclaims 
we will not be caught between iraq and a hard place 
its the newest slogan of energy conservationists gathering this 
weekend for the midwest renewable energy fair they believe the 
middle east crisis should refocus attention on how much america 
depends on fossil fuels after a decade of lagging interest 
we are caught with our backs against the wall again we dont 
have a solar industry or a renewable industry to fall back on 
said bob ramlow a fair organizer and operator of a solar products 
company in this central wisconsin town 
the fair is the largest of three planned nationwide this year to 
encourage reduced dependence on finite fossil fuels and expanded 
use of energy sources that are environmentally safe and renewable 
like the sun and wind 
about 10000 people were expected to attend the threeday fair 
which ends sunday educational seminars and displays like 
solarpowered microwave ovens and windpowered stereo sound systems 
dotted the fairgrounds 
some participants described themselves as 1960sstyle 
backtotheearth refugees who remember the gasoline crisis of 
the mid1970s and ensuing goals to wean the united states from 
heavy oil consumption 
iraqs invasion of kuwait in the oilrich persian gulf which 
caused gasoline prices to climb as much as 20 cents a gallon within 
a week serves as a reminder that the united states has failed to 
achieve those goals ramlow said 
he is one of several amherst residents who moved to the town of 
2500 in the 1970s to escape cities and experiment with alternate 
energy his home is fully solarpowered 
i have a color tv he said a vcr i have clock radios 
tape decks stereos a nintendo game for my kids you name it i 
have it you dont have to give up something to use less energy 
a lot of people in this area use wood for heating he added 
a lot of people drive highmileage cars there is definitely a 
good environmental attitude around here 
innovation is the pride of the 40 or so exhibitors at the fair 
john osborne of plymouth mich displayed a 12volt computer 
system that can be powered by alternate energy sources 
i am trying to appeal to the people who are running an office 
out of their homes with solar power osborne said i want to 
get high performance computers into the hands of these innovative 
people they are pioneers 
osborne said the middle east crisis demonstrates how hes doing 
more than saving money by turning from fuelburning power sources 
i have got solar panels on my roof nobody holds me hostage 
for my power he said 
most organizers exhibitors and fairgoers predicted the iraqi 
invasion while forcing a us military buildup might bring 
something positive if it awakens dormant energy concerns 
all the politicians want to jump on the bandwagon when that 
happens you can tell its hot said mike torzewski treasurer of 
the group of energyconscious amherst residents who organized the 
fair 
ken wirtz a visitor from nearby wisconsin rapids strolled by 
some displays with perhaps more interest than he might have had 
before gasoline prices soared 
when it costs you 20 to fill up your gas tank it makes you 
think a little bit he said 
richard perez editor of home power a magazine published in 
california that last year urged the return of renewable energy 
fairs said the time is right to expand use of solar and wind power 
iraqi president saddam hussein makes us realize we are 
incredibly dependent on foreign oil which makes us not free at 
all perez said i have a saying no one has to die for solar 
energy

consumer food prices are going up 5 percent to 
7 percent this year sharply more than had been predicted and 
perhaps slightly because of the mideast oil crunch the agriculture 
department says 
the new forecast compared with the 3 percent to 5 percent price 
hike the department has been predicting for 1990 since december 
doubledigit price gains in the first half of this year for 
fresh fruits pork eggs and dairy products along with 
uncertainties about future energy prices are mostly to blame 
for the upward revision said the departments economic research 
service 
however most of the years price increases probably took 
place in the first half the agency said friday gains in the 
second half are expected to be more modest 
but the report added that this assumes most of the evolving oil 
price shock will take until next year to spill over into the 
grocery store 
retail food prices rose an average of 58 percent in 1989 the 
sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 much of that gain was 
fallout from the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation 
one usda official who spoke only on condition of anonymity said 
that without the mideast crisis and rising energy costs the new 
food price estimate for 1990 would have been in the range of 5 
percent to 6 percent 
thus the official said an allowance of only one percentage 
point was made at the upper end of the estimate to allow for higher 
oil prices 
further the source said some department analysts had wanted to 
hold the new 1990 food price increase to less than what was 
decided most felt the oil pinch is not going to hit this year the 
source said

sweaters made of manmade fibers in taiwan are 
being sold in the united states at less than fair market value the 
commerce department says 
the national knitwear amp sportswear association in new york had 
filed complaints last september against sweater manufacturers in 
south korea hong kong and taiwan 
the department said friday it ruled against the manufacturers in 
hong kong on july 21 and against those in south korea on aug 3 
the findings clear the way for the international trade 
commission to determine whether the products are harming us 
industry if the commission finds us firms are being damaged the 
government can impose duties on the imports to make their prices 
comparable to those of us companies 
the department said the imports represent 72 percent of the 13 
billion us market and the three countries represent 55 percent of 
the imports it said the value of the sweaters imported from south 
korea in 1989 was 4761 million from hong kong 2088 million 
and taiwan 4855 million 
the department said the imports are made predominantly of 
acrylic fiber sweaters containing at least 23 percent wool are 
excluded

beginning to receive preliminary housing counts the census bureau 
reports 
official population numbers wont be issued until at least the 
end of the year though preliminary ones will be sent to state 
officials within a few weeks 
the early housing reports are designed to allow local 
governments to challenge the bureaus findings pointing out areas 
where homes and people may have been missed officials said 
the census got under way in march with the mailing of nearly 100 
million forms in recent weeks workers have been going doortodoor 
to try to count people who were missed in the first phase 
sending the preliminary count to local officials does not mean 
that the effort is complete census director barbara everitt bryant 
said 
the figures are open to challenge and workers will be sent out 
to doublecheck areas where officials question the totals 
in addition to sending housing counts to city county and town 
officials preliminary population counts will be sent to state 
governors state redistricting officials and members of congress

the us military commitment to saudi 
arabias defense is a longterm one defense secretary dick 
cheney says 
where well be a year or two from now i wouldnt want to 
speculate cheney told reporters friday on his plane headed for 
saudi arabia 
the secretarys fourday swing through several persian gulf 
nations is his second to the region since iraqi troops crushed 
kuwait and threatened saudi arabias vital oil reserves 
as us warships began intercepting iraqi ships and the sweep 
of us troops continued unabated into saudi arabia the secretary 
said he could not put an end point on the massive military endeavor 
noting that iraq has 10 divisions with an estimated 160000 
soldiers in kuwait cheney said its far too soon for us to talk 
about any change in our deployment 
asked about the chance for a decadeslong commitment to the 
region on the order of a nato defense cheney said what were 
doing now is carrying out the commitment we made to the saudis 10 
days ago and that commitment is to send a lot of force enough to 
be able to do what the president directed us to do 
the commitment is long term the question of how long the 
deployments are for will depend upon developments he said 
pressed to explain his reference to a yearslong commitment the 
secretary replied theres no way i can answer that question 
i have said repeatedly that we do not know how long we will have to 
stay i do not know when we will be able to come home 
the secretary refused to say how many us soldiers sailors and 
airmen have been deployed to the region saying only that the flow 
was continuing at a brisk pace and that no decision has been made 
yet to halt it 
pentagon sources have said tens of thousands of troops have 
already landed in saudi arabia with some 45000 marines in line to 
be deployed 
three aircraft carriers and their battle groups have been 
dispatched to the region along with the supersecret f117a stealth 
fighterbomber and dozens of f15 and f16 jet fighters 
asked whether there was enough firepower on the ground to repel 
the iraqi threat cheney said we have a lot of capability in 
theater id like to have more there before ill be comfortable 
with the situation 
the pentagon has requested that as many as 38 civilian airliners 
be turned over to military use for cargo and troop transport while 
some of the army and marine units are being transferred by 
slowermoving ships 
the secretary was to spend his first evening in the region 
aboard the carrier uss eisenhower in the red sea he planned to 
spend most of sunday visiting army air force and marine units at 
various sites in saudi arabia but reporters accompanying him were 
instructed that they wouldnt be able to describe the exact 
location of such units 
cheneys plane stopped in the azores a group of atlantic 
islands belonging to portugal for refueling en route saudi arabia 
the secretary said he added a brief stop in cairo onto the end 
of his trip which will take him to bahrain and several other 
persian gulf states before he returns to washington early wednesday

swift military action not an economic 
boycott is needed to drive iraqi forces out of kuwait and topple 
saddam hussein said a brother of saudi arabias king fahd 
prince turki bin abdul aziz a former deputy minister of 
defense said he believes the united nations international embargo 
intended to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait cannot work 
this embargo this boycott is not going to be useful because 
you know there are many merchants of war who make their living by 
contributing to the escalation of war among nations prince turki 
said through an interpreter at a news conference friday 
the best course would be for an international force to take 
swift military action the prince said i think if they want to 
put a quick end to it the united states knows how to do that he 
said 
saddam is a sadist and a psychotic he enjoys killing 
people the prince said 
i am not talking about eliminating him physically or 
assassination but they should put an end to his rule to his 
regime because he is a bloodthirsty person and thats his trade he 
lives off blood he said 
the prince 53 also said he was disappointed in king hussein of 
jordan who met thursday with president bush 
i was hoping that king hussein would not go down and lower 
himself to come to the united states as an emissary of saddam 
hussein he said i thought he would honor himself further if 
he hadnt done so 
it was originally believed the king was carrying a message from 
saddam but hussein said thursday that he had no such message 
the prince one of the kings seven full brothers said he came 
to cambridge to talk about how he could enhance harvard 
universitys educational programs in medicine and human rights

wellpaid jobs good benefits and 
tax breaks draw americans back from vacation to the uncertainties 
of saudi arabia although some say they are returning only to test 
the waters 
i want to pay for college and law school otherwise ill end 
up a bartender said 23yearold james byrne of owego ny one 
of several expatriates on saudi arabian airlines flight 24 from new 
york to jiddah friday 
byrne left his wife and 1yearold son in new york while he 
finishes the second year of a twoyear contract with boeing to 
supervise the crew working on the five saudiowned awacs radar 
planes and their refueling tankers 
byrne who earns 30000 a year taxfree and lives on a boeing 
compound where housing is free and amenities are plenty said he 
couldnt afford not to return 
still byrne said he was concerned about the military situation 
and intended to ask his company to provide him with a gas mask 
against chemical warfare 
byrne said many of his expatriate friends in saudi arabia were 
also uncertain about whether to leave but wanted to wait out the 
year to avoid paying us taxes 
nancy bonnette of austin texas also said the financial 
incentives for staying are great she said she and her husband want 
to spend between two and four more years in saudi arabia 
to the dismay of friends and family the bonnettes never really 
thought twice about returning 
mrs bonnette said her decision was sealed when a friend at the 
pentagon told her the defense department viewed the us buildup 
as a relatively longterm commitment and didnt expect an allout 
war with iraqi troops 
others on the flight back to saudi arabia said they would wait 
and see 
were going back to jiddah for one week during this week 
if i dont like the feeling im getting im leaving said julie 
hallberg of balsam lake wis 
mrs hallberg and her husband monte work at the international 
school in jidah located on the red sea 1000 miles from where 
american troops are massing near the persian gulf 
mrs hallberg a physical education teacher said she left her 
children ages seven four and one with her parents for a week 
she and her husband will return for the kids if theyre satisfied 
the situation is calm 
mrs hallberg said her husband who remained in jiddah while she 
vacationed with their children in the united states this month had 
told her life was unchanged by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the day it started he didnt really know that much about it 
mrs hallberg said 
mrs hallberg said she hopes to stay in saudia arabia where the 
family has lived for seven years 
you make good benefits and we ended up liking it she said 
for some the arrival of thousands of american troops in the 
peaceful country represented the end of an era in which foreigners 
lived a sheltered comfortable existence mixing mainly among 
themselves 
ive been here nine years and now i dont know what i am going 
to do said james green a briton with a photographic studio in 
jiddah 
several major us companies have flown dependents out of saudi 
arabia suggesting that women and children stay away temporarily 
boeing co took women and children to headquarters in seattle 
last week and aramco the huge oil consortium has offered to 
transport dependents 
it was unclear how many americans have left the country but bob 
bonnette a data processer with saudi arabian airlines said people 
living in the eastern provinces nearer the kuwait border would feel 
less secure 
the arab news an englishlanguage newspaper reported that 
flights into dhahran which is the center of us troop activity 
continue to bring foreign workers into the country 
it said air traffic primarily from india and pakistan was 
unchanged from last year many workers in the oil fields are asian

iraqs armed takeover of 
kuwait has left five americanflagged oil tankers worth nearly 150 
million in legal limbo as to who owns them shipping industry 
sources say 
the ships are the last of 11 kuwaiti tankers reflagged by the 
united states in mid1987 to ensure american naval protection from 
attacks by iran in the persian gulf 
they remained under the stars and stripes when the other six 
reverted to kuwaiti registry following the iraniraq ceasefire on 
august 20 1988 
one of the five the chesapeake city reportedly just escaped 
seizure when the iraqi invasion on aug 2 caught it forging into 
kuwaiti waters 
the 401000ton crude carrier bridgeton the worlds sixth 
largest ship and the four oil products tankers of about 80000 
tons each were last reported at anchor at ports around the gulf 
while officials ponder their status said walter oates a us 
maritime administration spokesman 
the vessels have been manned for the past year by american 
crews about 30 per ship 
oates in a telephone interview said kuwaiti officials had 
recently indicated they wanted to deflag the other five ships 
but thats obviously a moot point now 
another us maritime source who declined to be named said the 
ships probably would remain under us jurisdiction pending 
clarification of their legal status 
he said it was a strange situation nobody really knows 
what happens next 
the kuwaitis in 1987 set up a delaware corporation chesapeake 
shipping co to meet us legal requirements that americanflagged 
ships have us owners the firm could not be reached for comment 
philip wake a senior consultant for lloyds maritime information 
services in london said that as long as delaware shipping co 
remains a legal entity kuwait probably would be considered the 
owner of the tankers 
but when something like this crops up its a political 
question to a large extent and when it gets to the lawyers they 
can have a field day he said 
wake said an ultra large crude carrier like the bridgeton is 
currently worth about 40 million on the tanker market with oil 
products tankers in the 80000ton range worth about 27 million 
iraqi president saddam hussein annexed kuwait after the invasion 
and abolished its government but the united states and other 
countries have not recognized the action and froze both countries 
international assets 
us sources said they did not know the whereabouts of some 15 
other stateowned kuwaiti tankers 
a sister ship to the chesapeake city the sea isle city was 
also in the gulf en route to kuwait and was diverted to the saudi 
arabian port of jubail the sources said 
the bridgeton was undergoing a coast guard inspection at khor 
fakkhan just outside the gulf on the day of the takeover oates 
said it was still there along with the other two tankers ocean 
city and surf city 
flying the us flag during the gulf tanker war entitled the 
kuwaiti vessels to us navy protection at a time when iranian 
gunboats were attacking commercial shipping in retaliation for 
iraqi air strikes on irans own oil tankers and terminals 
the iranians singled out kuwait and saudi ships because of those 
countries support for baghdad 
no reflagged tanker was ever directly attacked while under naval 
escort but the bridgeton hit a mine and the sea isle city was 
badly damaged by an iranian silkworm missile while at kuwait to 
take on cargo

thirteen carloads of american and other 
refugees tore through desert sands to avoid iraqi troops in a 
dramatic escape from kuwait to saudi arabia a californian member 
of the convoy says 
it was a hectic rather perilous drive past iraqi checkpoints 
and through uninhabited desert regions between kuwait and saudi 
arabia stephanie mcgehee 37 said after the group made it over 
the border friday 
mcgehee of leucadia calif a member of the group and a 
parttime photographer and reporter for the associated press in 
kuwait spoke by telephone from the khafji border post 
the total number of people in the 13car convoy was not 
immediately clear although nine people crammed into mcgehees car 
including two other americans a canadian a briton and four 
indians for the fourhour journey 
on friday iraq ordered britons and americans in kuwait to 
report to two hotels prompting fears they would be taken to 
baghdad as hostages many foreigners apparently decided to risk the 
iraqi tanks and desert for freedom 
mcgehee said that she and canadian cathy mcgregor donned kuwaiti 
floorlength black chadour overcoats mcgregor in her early 30s 
had been a top executive with the kuwait sas hotel for about five 
years 
and mcgehee who had lived 12 years in lebanon and kuwait said 
she used her knowledge of arabic dialects to talk her way past the 
iraqi invaders who have occupied kuwait since aug 2 
it seems the iraqis got the impression the entire convoy 
comprised only arab evacuees said mcgehee i spoke at length 
in arabic with a mixture of kuwaiti and lebanese accents to the 
iraqis at the last checkpoint 15 miles off alkhafji 
the ploy seemed to work at first and none of the other cars were 
checked 
but the iraqi troops suddenly told the party to return home 
mcgehee said 
they moved a few miles back toward kuwait then veered into a 
desert expanse and kept driving until they saw some bedouins who 
pointed to the saudi border 
we breathed a sigh of relief when we saw a sign that showed 
clearly we were entering saudi arabia said mcgehee 
mcgehee and mcgregor lived in a house in an old quarter of 
kuwait city a stones throw from the sheraton hotel and the 
aljahra boulevard 
the iraqi invaders punched into kuwait city with 350 tanks 
through aljahra at sunrise more than two weeks ago mcgehee 
sighted them and phoned the ap a series of reports 
two days later the going got rough the risks high she 
said cathy and i had to move to a safer place the iraqis were 
already rampaging looting raping and murdering 
they moved to another western residence where mcgehee tried to 
carry on communicating news of the invasion there they spent 10 
days until westerners began to panic 
it became extremely dangerous for us westerners to circulate 
in the city and we had to stay indoors most of the time she 
said what hurt us most was the long breakdown in telephone and 
telex links with the outside world 
she said the city became oppressively silent except for the 
staccato of machine gunfire and deafening bomb blasts 
on the ninth day in hiding she said the iraqis announced they 
wanted all us and british expatriates to gather at the 
international hotel across from the us embassy compound 
many of us panicked she said we thought the iraqis were 
bent on moving us to baghdad where we would be kept hostage she 
said she contacted many westerners and the decision among them was 
unanimous we go 
they gathered every car they could find 
driving along the asphalt road was smooth but frightening 
because the iraqis were always there she said our drive 
through the desolate desert was much safer rather comforting even 
though we felt we were moving to nowhere

a british television broadcasting 
satellite orbited earth today after a successful ride into space 
aboard an unmanned delta rocket 
the liftoff friday night was nearly two hours behind schedule 
because of thunderstorms and lastminute problems with a computer 
used to display range data 
the british satellite broadcasting satellite called marcopolo 
2 will transmit programs directly to thousands of homes in britain 
one of the nice things about this launch is that it was not 
only successful but the holds delays worked out for a night 
launch which is always more spectacular said former astronaut 
charles pete conrad now a vice president for rocket builder 
mcdonnell douglas 
the satellite separated from the booster as planned about 28 
minutes after the 842 pm liftoff from cape canaveral air force 
station an onboard kick motor is to put the satellite into a 
22300milehigh orbit on sunday 
an identical spacecraft marcopolo 1 was launched aboard a 
delta rocket last aug 27 it was the united states first 
commercial launch of a payload into orbit fridays launch was the 
ninth 
the cost of both marcopolo satellites and launches is about 300 
million said ellis griffiths director of engineering for british 
satellite broadcasting 
marcopolo 2 eventually will be situated over the atlantic ocean 
near the first satellite each 1450pound spacecraft has a 
lifetime of at least 10 years 
once marcopolo 2 becomes fully operational in early december it 
will enable the company to transmit at full power over five 
transponder channels only one channel currently is being beamed at 
full power the other four are at half power 
british satellite broadcasting is the only company in the world 
that is transmitting television programs directly from orbiting 
satellites to homes griffiths said so far there have been no 
satellite problems he said 
unlike in the united states its not always feasible to mount 
large satellite dishes in britain griffiths said in large 
blocks of tenements to have huge dishes everywhere its just 
totally impractical he said 
about 50000 units have been installed in british homes so 
signals can be received directly from the powerful satellites 
griffiths said each unit consists of a 157inchsquare antenna 
and a receiver about the size of a videocassette recorder 
british satellite broadcasting expects to have about 1 million 
units installed by the end of the year griffiths said

ambassadors of the five permanent members 
of the security council and their senior military aides have held 
an extraordinary joint meeting to discuss a larger un military 
role in the persian gulf crisis 
also friday the security council expressed anxiety over the 
fate of foreigners trapped in kuwait and iraq and called on the 
un secretarygeneral to take all necessary steps to help them 
the security council was scheduled to meet again today on the 
crisis which began aug 2 when iraqi tanks and troops poured into 
kuwait and then massed at the saudi arabian border 
french ambassador pierre louis blanc said the five permanent 
members of the council met friday to exchange information on the 
naval activities in the gulf and in the area he spoke to 
reporters after the meeting at the french mission 
the meeting was attended by un envoys of the united states 
britain china france and the soviet union and by military 
advisers of the five governments together known as the security 
councils military staff committee 
the committee was created 44 years ago but has been inactive 
meeting on a perfunctory basis two times a month 
diplomats said fridays meeting was not ordinary it included 
senior us british and french officers a senior soviet official 
was unable to attend and the level of the chinese military was not 
known 
no immediate indication surfaced that the five were moving to 
form a joint un military command in the gulf but western 
observers said the group moved with extraordinary speed to discuss 
coordination and a un military role 
we wont have a un army tomorrow one observer said on 
condition of anonymity but we could have exchange of information 
and coordination letting each other know about rules of 
engagement and that is quite significant 
by un standards that is whirlwind progress the observer 
said 
under the un charter the military staff committee is charged 
with coordinating all un military actions of an enforcement 
nature excluding peacekeeping 
it is intended to organize and command joint military 
operations which never have come into existence the last time the 
un flag was flown in a un enforcement operation was during the 
195053 korean war 
that war was not strictly a un operation however and was 
handed over to the united states 
moscow has been pressing for an expanded un peacekeeping role 
and for revival of the un military staff committee foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze said friday the soviet union would 
send troops to the gulf if the united nations calls for a 
multilateral military force 
late friday the speaker of iraqs parliament sadi mahdi said 
iraq will hold all foreigners from aggressive nations until the 
threat of war against his country ends his statement was carried 
by the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia 
mahdi said foreigners would be spread throughout iraq housed in 
military and civilian installations 
hundreds of thousands of foreigners including about 4000 
britons and 2500 americans were stranded when iraq overran kuwait 
on aug 2 another 500 americans were in iraq

the soviet union is facing a crime wave and its 
turning for help to the city that gave the world scarface al 
capone and the st valentines day massacre 
the soviets are hunting down the latest in crimefighting 
techniques from lie detectors to fingerprinting networks to 
communication systems 
their interest really kind of shook me up matt l 
rodriguez a deputy superintendent for the chicago police 
department said friday 
a sixmember team will leave for moscow next month to teach 
soviet police how to deal with such antisocial phenomena as bank 
holdups restaurant arson mugging and auto chop shops

office of international criminal justice at the university of 
illinois 
i recall when they came through here that they were quite 
emphatic said rodriguez a member of the team they came here 
to learn and didnt want any side trips they wanted business

this red sea port jordans only outlet to 
the sea could prove of crucial importance in the success of the 
international effort to clamp sanctions on iraq and force it to 
withdraw from kuwait 
shipping sources say even if the us navy tries to prevent 
merchandise and food supplies from reaching iraq through aqaba it 
will be unable to determine what is jordans and what is iraqs 
local importers say they are already placing orders for goods 
they intend to channel from aqaba to the eastern border with iraq 
in violation of mandatory united nations sanctions imposed since 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait aug 2 
king hussein has said he will abide by the sanctions but wants 
to resolve the issue of how and to what extent sanctions should be 
applied by jordan whose economy is heavily dependent on trade with 
iraq 
president bush at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine 
met with hussein thursday and said later i cant say i am 
satisfied but what i am is encouraged that jordan intends to 
abide by the sanctions decision 
asked if the king assured him jordan would stop iraqi goods 
transiting aqaba bush said flatly yes 
but hussein told reporters that jordan was still trying to find 
out from the un exactly what these sanctions mean 
the monarch said aqaba was jordans only outlet to the sea and 
to the rest of the world and could not be shut entirely 
crown prince hassan on friday told britains independent 
television news that jordan stands to suffer perhaps more 
economically than any other country as a result of the un 
sanctions 
pending clarification from the united nations ships continue to 
unload cargo in aqaba scores of heavy trucks many with the 
distinctive yellow iraqi markings rumble along the desert highway 
on their way inland 
daily many can be seen crossing the border into iraq 
as long as goods continue to reach aqaba ostensibly for the 
local jordanian market part are bound to find their way across the 
border one jordanian merchant said on condition of anonymity 
he said local importers who like most jordanians are opposed to 
the imposition of sanctions against iraq are determined to find 
ways to continue channeling vital supplies 
shipping sources in aqaba said on condition of anonymity that 
the embargo was also strongly opposed by the 5000 dock workers and 
20000 truck drivers who would lose their jobs if the port were 
closed to iraqi cargo 
all these people have a vested interest for the violation of 
the embargo quite apart from supporting saddam hussein like most 
jordanians one source said referring to the iraqi president 
hassan said the issue was not just one of dollars and cents for 
jordan but that there is tremendous public opinion in favor of 
saddam who is seen among many arabs as a champion of the poor 
the prevalent belief among jordanians is that short of a total 
blockade of aqaba plugging the sanctions loophole is virtually 
impossible 
there was no unloading of ships at aqaba on friday because of 
the moslem weekly holiday but port officials said normal work 
would resume today on the 15 ships docked in the port 
before the gulf crisis an average of 35 ships were in the port 
daily the shipping officials said 
lloyds list international the authoritative shipping newspaper 
of the insurance underwriters lloyds of london said thursday 
sanctions against iraq had cut cargo handling at aqaba by 80 
percent 
the newspaper said all cargo bound for iraq had ceased although 
such exports are difficult to track the publication estimated that 
aqabas proportion of cargo destined for iraq would normally be 
about 70 percent 
the shipping sources said much of the cargo leaving the port by 
truck was from warehouses in aqabas free port area they said 
stored goods exceeded 10 million in value

the soviet and west german foreign ministers say 
they have agreed on the main points of a german unification plan 
and that the allies may sign a treaty giving up control in less 
than a month 
we are going to change opinions about the future of united 
germany and the soviet union foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze predicted at a joint news conference friday with west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
the new treaty will cover cooperation in the economy trade 
science technology culture and soviet troops stationed in former 
communist east germany shevardnadze said 
the soviet foreign minister said he expects to initial and 
possibly sign the final document giving up the four allies 
authority over germany on sept 12 in moscow as scheduled 
shevardnadze and genscher said they agreed on the essence of the 
concluding document on external aspects of unification although a 
few final details remained shevardnadze said he expects the other 
parties in the twoplusfour talks to agree with their work 
the two are east germany and west germany and the four 
are the world war ii allied victors the soviet union the united 
states britain and france 
genscher said initialing of the twoplusfour document next 
month would show that there is no external reason to prevent german 
unification which he expects to occur oct 1314 
shevardnadze said the document might even be signed sept 12 
the four powers and the united germany then would be expected to 
ratify the treaty under their respective constitutional processes 
he said 
genscher said he expects west german chancellor helmut kohl to 
spell out details for the sovietgerman treaty proposal in a letter 
to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev which would be sent 
before the sept 12 meeting 
shevardnadze said the two sides also had agreed on material 
and financial concerns regarding the presence and withdrawal of 
soviet troops from east germany genscher said final details will 
be worked out in meetings between the soviet and west german 
finance ministers aug 24 
west germany has agreed to help pay for the soviet soldiers 
upkeep because the soviet union is short of convertible currency 
which is necessary now that east germany has switched to use of the 
west german mark 
cost of this agreement to west germany for the second half of 
this year is estimated to be 780 million genscher also said east 
germany and west germany will issue statements before sept 12 on 
their respective final troop ceilings 
gorbachev and kohl agreed at a meeting at a soviet mountain 
resort in july on the most difficult issues of german unification 
these included the united germanys membership in nato and 
reduction of its combined armed forces from 600000 to 370000 over 
three to four years 
the soviets agreed to withdraw their 380000 soldiers from east 
german territory in the same time period 
genscher said the two men also discussed the withdrawal of the 
four powers troops from berlin the earlier kohlgorbachev meeting 
decided that western soldiers could stay in berlin as long as 
soviet troops remained in east germany

attended 
when the pope embraced him it was sort of a symbol an 
expression of acceptance and compassion and encouragement and 
support for him and all the things he represented children the

sign saying please give money mrs orourke said brendan 
collected 7 which he intended to spend on toys 
the last two days he was very sick she said but he went 
peacefully this morning

life and he seemed to be able to deal with that rather well for 
somebody of his age for somebody even 10 times his age

1979 revolution 
in a letter to national assembly speaker miriam arguello the 
president expressed hope the pardons of those involved in the fatal 
shooting of la prensa publisher pedro joaquin chamorro will help 
pacify the country 
in the spirit of national reconciliation which i am trying to 
encourage in our longsuffering nicaragua this is an opportune 
moment to make this pardon effective mrs chamorros letter said 
excerpts of the covering letter accompanying an amnesty bill 
were published thursday by la prensa an afternoon newspaper and 
for many years nicaraguas only opposition daily 
mrs chamorro took office april 25 after defeating the leftist 
sandinistas by a landslide in elections three months before and 
one her campaigns main promises was to help bring peace and 
conciliate feuding factions

denouncing in his newspaper human rights abuses corruption and 
other excesses under president anastasio somoza the last of a long 
line of strongmen who ruled nicaragua with an iron fist for 42 
years 
his automobile was ambushed as he drove to work jan 10 1978 
and he was shot to death on a managua street his death set off 
days of violent demonstrations and helped rally opponents around 
the leftist sandinista movement which seized power in a revolution 
a year later 
la prensa continued to expose and criticize government 
mismanagement and other excesses under the sandinistas who 
subjected it to strict censorship and closed it for long periods of 
time because of it 
mrs chamorro asked the legislature to approve the pardons as 
soon as possible saying she is confident the national assembly 
will respond with the same sentiments of forgiveness and 
reconciliation 
sources at the national assembly who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the legislature will start debating the bill at its 
next session on wednesday it will be discussed and approved 
urgently one source said 
the draft bill mentions no names but specifies that those 
favored by this pardon will be freed immediately after the 
assembly approves it 
police at the time arrested five men described as hired guns 
silvio pena domingo acevedo silvio vega harold cedeno and juan 
ramon acevedo all were convicted and sentenced from 21 to 30 years 
in prison without parole 
on thursday the sandinista newspaper barricada said mrs 
chamorro also asked that 82 other common criminals be pardoned 
along with the five men 
the chamorro family after the sandinistas took power also 
filed charges against anastasio somoza portocarrere a son of the 
dictator a somoza official named fausto zelaya and cuban exile 
pedro ramos for engineering the murder

mrs chamorros petition did not specify if they would be included 
in the pardon

russian prime minister ivan silayev has urged 
exiled writer alexander solzhenitsyn to accept his restored soviet 
citizenship and return home as silayevs guest according to media 
reports today 
in a letter published on the front page of sovietskaya rossia 
newspaper silayev said solzhenitsyns homecoming was one of 
those moves that our homeland needs as much as air 
the interests of the state and its future destiny compel me to 
ask you and your family to accept an invitation to be my personal 
guests at any time you choose wrote silayev premier of the 
largest soviet republic 
solzhenitsyn 71 was one of 23 people whose citizenship was 
restored wednesday by president mikhail s gorbachev who also 
apologized for two decades of political repression by previous 
soviet leaders 
the nobel prizewinning solzhenitsyn 71 was arrested for 
treason in february 1974 forced onto a plane to germany and 
stripped of his citizenship 
he now lives in cavendish vt and says he wont return unless 
all his books have been published in the soviet union and are 
widely available 
solzhenitsyns wife natalia said her husband also wants the 
expulsion order and treason charges lifted before he will consider 
taking back his soviet citizenship 
solzhenitsyns books include the gulag archipelago about 
the horrors of josef stalins prison camps one day in the life 
of ivan denisovich cancer ward august 1914 and the 
first circle 
several of his works have been published in the soviet union but 
few novels from any author are widely available in the 
shortageplagued society 
silayev calling solzhenitsyn the great son of the russian 
people said his invitation was motivated by the common love of 
the longsuffering russian land and its people 
your words about russia have rung out the world over invoking 
its fate in the cruel and ruthless 20th century he wrote 
today your words have reached our homeland as well and they are 
needed everywhere in all walks of life religious and spiritual 
cultural public and economic 
silayev said that at a time soviet society is going through 
tumultuous and divisive changes your coming to russia is in my 
view one of those moves that our homeland needs as much as air 
soviet officials have identified only 10 of the 23 people whose 
citizenship gorbachev restored under presidential decree they were 
deprived of their rights as soviet citizens between the years 1966 
and 1988 
besides solzhenitsyn they are chess champion victor korchnoi 
writers vasily aksyonov vladimir voinovich lev kopelev georgi 
valdimov and valeri tarsis scientists yuri orlov and valeri 
chalidze and artist oskar rabin 
the full list is to be published later this month

a man who killed his 2yearold stepson by 
plunging him headfirst into a toilet escaped being condemned to 
death because the judge thought a death penalty would be overturned 
on appeal 
i feel the court has no choice but to follow the jurys 
recommendation for life in prison circuit judge randall mcdonald 
ruled friday 
thomas coe 23 must serve 25 years before being eligible for 
parole he was convicted of firstdegree murder and aggravated 
child abuse in the death of bradley mcgee 
in response to the killing the state legislature rewrote child 
welfare laws to put the childs safety above the goal of keeping 
families together and allocated 79 million for more 
childprotection social workers 
mcdonald said the sentence was appropriate since he could find 
no case where the death penalty was upheld for a childabuse murder 
i guess you can get the death penalty if you kill a man 
responded pam kirkland the childs foster mother for 14 months 
but you get life if you kill a child 
bradley died of massive head injuries july 28 1989 only two 
months after he was ordered returned to coe and his mother sheryl 
mcgee coe 
coe testified being angered when he picked up bradley by the 
ankles and slammed him into the commode as a punishment for soiling 
his pants but he said he never meant to harm the child 
coes wife testified that her husband routinely ground his fist 
and cayenne pepper into bradleys genitals and forced him to pick 
his feces off the floor with his mouth 
mrs coe 21 earlier this year pleaded no contest to 
seconddegree murder and aggravated child abuse in her sons death 
and is serving a 30year prison term 
jurors who convicted coe on july 30 were deadlocked 66 in the 
penalty phase resulting in an automatic recommendation for life 
defense attorney robert norgard said he planned to appeal both 
the conviction and sentence prosecutors refused comment 
bradleys death sparked public outrage because it occurred while 
he was under the supervision of state social workers 
bradleys main caseworker margaret barber was convicted of 
child abuse for disregarding a psychological report that described 
the coes as unfit parents she was sentenced to three years 
probation

six months after soviet tanks 
began rolling out the rolling stones have rolled in marking a 
high point for the new cultural freedom long denied by the 
countrys ousted communist rulers 
the band plays for the first time in czehoslovakia today at 
pragues strahov stadium listed in the guiness book of world 
records as the worlds largest with a capacity for 240000 people 
its a great opportunity for us to play to people who could 
never hear us before keith richards the bands lead guitarist 
said in a documentary aired thursday on state television 
proceeds of the concert will go to the czechoslovak childrens 
foundation which benefits handicapped children romanian refugees 
and victims of the nuclear disaster at chernobyl according to 
media reports in london the charity is headed by olga havel wife 
of czechoslovak president vaclav havel 
unused for the last five years the stadium was given a new coat 
of paint before technicians started assembling the mammoth sound 
system and elaborate stage for the rolling stones concert 
close to 100000 thousand people are expected to enjoy 
sympathy for the devil jumping jack flash and other hits 
from the bands 25yearlong career rarely heard publicly in 
czechoslovakia under communist rule 
on feb 26 soviet tanks began leaving czechoslovakia ending two 
decades of military occupation and sealing the fate of 
czehoslovakias hardline communist rulers ousted in a popular 
revolution late last year 
and on aug 12 the first truck of the rolling stones world tour 
started rolling into prague marking the new winds of 
liberalization after forty years of communist rule and 
statedecreed culture 
the impact of the stones arrival has been dramatic in prague 
where over the years fans have had to buy the bands albums at 
inflated prices on the black market 
its a dream come true something i never hoped to see in my 
life said ivan kadanka a 43yearold drummer whose band will 
perform as a support act to the rolling stones show its a 
unique experience something i am going to tell my children and 
grandchildren about 
if the emotional content of the performance is overwhelming for 
musicians the sheer size of the show exceeds the imagination of 
czech promoters 
when we started talking about it in may we were six people 
who put together 400 of capital and started daydreaming about a 
show that costs 15 million to produce said milan pesik of mars 
productions a promotion group 
pesik said the stones thought the promotion group was a bunch 
of phonies who wanted to have fun at the bands expense it was 
only the invitation of president havel that got things moving he 
said 
soon an unprecedented publicity campaign was unleashed in the 
countrys media a stranger to the hype of bigtime show business 
hi im mick jagger the stones are rolling into prague the 
bands singer and leader said in czech to millions of tv viewers 
for two weeks several times a day that message established jagger 
as a household name in a country that in the past had virtually 
banned rock music 
a gigantic red tongue in a huge mouth the stoness traditional 
logo appeared atop a hill where a statue of soviet dictator 
joseph stalin once stood the hill the summit of which is called 
letna plain looks out over the city center 
a video screening of the show on the american leg of the show 
was held on pragues old town square monday and attracted about 
10000 viewers 
supraphon the state record company and bonton its newly born 
private competitor released the bands latest album steel 
wheels on unusually short notice in a country where world hits 
usually reach the charts years after their popularity has faded in 
the west 
but for some the stones concert has a particular meaning at a 
time czechoslovakia struggles to implement market and democratic 
reforms 
the important thing i see in an event like this is not only 
the fun and razzle dazzle said cenek petak a veteran 
saxophone player its a way of showing the people that it takes 
years to become that good it takes tradition positive attitude 
and lots of hard work 
its something you cannot achieve overnight by waving a magic 
wand and that i think is a message this country should hear right 
now petak said

the father of a 14yearold girl whose indiabound plane was 
intercepted in kuwait by invading iraqi troops implored the 
government of saddam hussein to release her 
im hoping and im praying and im making a desperate plea to 
the iraqi government said dr chandra polam a pittsburgh 
cardiologist shes a child shes by herself show mercy 
the british airways plane was intercepted by iraqi soldiers when 
it made a stopover in kuwait on an aug 2 flight to new delhi 
vinil polam going to visit her grandparents joined the thousands 
of americans caught up in the persian gulf crisis 
airline officials have told polam his daughter is safe at a 
hotel near the kuwait airport but that has done little to allay 
more than two weeks filled with anxiety confusion and frustration 
the sense of alarm that relatives feel was heightened friday 
when the speaker of iraqs parliament said all foreigners from 
aggressive nations presumably including the 3000 americans 
in iraq and kuwait would be held until the threat of war against 
his country ends 
he said they would be spread throughout the country housed in 
military and civilian targets 
relatives of other americans and foreigners stranded in kuwait 
and iraq by the invasion are desperately seeking news of their 
loved ones some have organized support groups others are eating 
and sleeping by their telephones 
for mary trundy waiting for word from her twin brother trapped 
in kuwait is all frighteningly familiar in 1979 43yearold john 
stevenson escaped from iran just hours before militants seized the 
us embassy 
its a nightmare that doesnt end trundy said from her home 
in brockton mass about 20 miles south of boston its just too 
much now two times in a row 
stevenson called his sister twice the day of the invasion and 
hoped to escape to saudi arabia the following day 
he said it was just like iran again only that they werent 
shooting in the streets she said 
in eastern iowa nedra hanken of monticello awaited word of her 
31yearold daughter beth who has lived with her husband the past 
five years in kuwait 
we havent heard anything and i dont know that any other 
american families have either she said 
in new harmony ind joan khajas 12 brothers and sisters were 
concerned when she left home for kuwait last month five months 
pregnant to take her two small children to visit their 
grandparents 
now that concern has turned to fear and khajas family 
maintains a 24hour vigil near television and telephone 
in odessa texas donnita cole said you wait for the 
telephone to ring when it doesnt ring you worry to death 
her husband is an employee of oge drilling co and has been 
living in kuwait city 
mrs cole said she had developed a minisupport network of other 
families in the same situation 
we kind of give each other moral support when one of us starts 
to crack a little she said i think were going to be in for 
quite a long spell on this

iraq threatened today to use weapons of 
mass destruction against any attacker it did not specify the 
weapons it referred to but baghdad has an arsenal of chemical 
weapons and longrange missiles 
also today iraq indicated for the first time that it would use 
soldiers who had been deployed against iran to bolster troops 
facing a growing multinational force in saudi arabia 
iraq on friday began withdrawing thousands of troops from 
iranian territory occupied since their 198088 war the iraqi army 
daily alqaddasiyah declared today in an editorial that the 30 
divisions which had been facing iran in the north would now be 
deployed in the south 
the daily said the troops which are leaving irans borders 
and the high readiness of our air force will be an additional might 
to what we had already prepared against the aggressive forces 
alqaddisiyah also said baghdad was prepared to use all the 
weapons at its disposal against aggressors 
weapons of mass destruction and strategic deterrence possessed 
by iraq will be lying in wait to turn those who contemplate 
committing aggression into scattered pieces the daily said 
iraq has used chemical weapons against its own kurdish minority 
and against iranian forces during the iraqiran war 
it was not known how many of the 30 iraqi divisions more than 
200000 men would be moved to kuwait or the saudi front the 
iraqis are believed to have at least seven divisions in kuwait and

egypt today asked arab foreign ministers to 
meet in cairo in a week to discuss the persian gulf crisis brought 
on by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
hassaan elabbadi egypts assistant foreign minister told 
reporters the meeting of the arab league council ministers was 
proposed for aug 26 
the ministers were to hear a report from chadli klibi the 
leagues secretarygeneral on whether a resolution adopted by an 
arab summit in cairo on aug 10 is being implemented 
that resolution sanctioned the dispatch of arab forces to saudi 
arabia and other persian gulf countries requesting help in 
defending against a possible iraqi attack 
the measure approved by 12 of the arab leagues 21 members 
also demanded immediate withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait and 
reinstatement of the kuwaiti government the iraqis ousted after the 
aug 2 invasion 
the resolution called on klibi to report back to the leagues 
council within 15 days on its implementation 
except for dispatch of arab troops to saudi arabia little has 
been done to carry it out but arab diplomatic sources said the aim 
of the meeting was probably to keep pressure on baghdad 
mubarak has been a leader in diplomatic efforts to end the 
crisis including a mediation bid just prior to the invasion he 
also organized the aug 10 arab league meeting which came two days 
after kuwaits annexation 
the gathering brought heated arguments by the iraqi delegation 
and the representatives of the deposed kuwait government 
mubarak has said he still hopes for a peaceful resolution to the 
crisis 
the iraqis say the annexation of kuwait is irrevocable and 
baghdad considers the emirate a southern region of iraq 
egypt has sent a force to saudi arabia that president hosni 
mubarak says will not exceed 2000 men morocco was reported to 
have sent 1200 men and syria a handful of staff officers

to undermine the process towards peace

between mandela and president fw de klerk they have been meeting 
to clear the way for formal negotiations on an end to white 
minority rule 
inkatha president mangosuthu buthelezi said anc supporters 
frequently insult denigrate and attack inkatha members on the 
trains in the buses and other places which has resulted in the 
conflict in soweto 
buthelezi making his statement in ulundi in natal province 
said inkatha was committed to democracy and opposed to violence 
but he said anc slurs against inkatha had been extremely 
provocative and until respect for one another is observed it 
will be difficult to obtain peace

saudi arabia plans to increase its 
oil output by up to 2 million barrels a day to help offset the 
shortfall on world markets caused by the iraqi invasion the oil 
minister indicated today 
but he said saudi arabia alone cannot make up for the 4 million 
barrels of oil a day that international markets lost when iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and most nations responded by imposing an 
oil embargo on baghdad 
by invading and annexing kuwait iraq gained control of about 20 
percent of the worlds oil reserves and the withdrawal of its 
crude from the market has caused oil and gas prices to soar 
the saudi oil minister hisham nazer spoke with reporters today 
at a news conference in the summer capital of jiddah 
he said that if an emergency session of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries proposed by the kingdom does not 
occur then it will be left for each member state to decide 
alone on the increase in output 
he said that even if saudi arabia the worlds largest oil 
exporter increases its output by the maximum of 2 million barrels 
a day it cannot make up for the 4 million barrels daily that the 
sanctions on iraq and occupied kuwait removed from world markets 
venezuela and the united arab emirates could increase output by 
half a million barrels per day nazer said but this would leave 
us with 1 million barrels less 
meanwhile the turmoil in the middle east where thousands of 
us troops are being deployed to defend saudi arabia against a 
possible iraqi attack contineu to create havoc on world markets 
unleaded gasoline hit a record high friday on the new york 
mercantile exchange as crude oil prices shot up and speculators 
kept betting that the middle east standoff would curtail supplies 
september wholesale unleaded gas futures soared to as high as 
9625 cents before settling at 9597 cents per gallon up 85 cents 
from thursdays record close 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude finished up 127 at 2863 per barrel

tumor progression a spokeswoman said today 
the spokeswoman leslie goodman didnt respond directly when 
asked about reports that doctors had discovered a second tumor in 
the brain of the 39yearold atwater 
she said physicians were not specific on that 
two south carolina newspapers today quoted unidentified sources 
as saying doctors had discovered a new growth 
their statement was that there has been tumor progression and 
thats about as much as we know and about as far as they intend to 
go in their description she said 
his condition is unchanged goodman said hes alert 
seeing visitors and did undergo radiation treatment yesterday 
an rnc statement issued late thursday had said a biopsy 
performed on atwater this week indicated tumor progression 
requiring additional treatment the statement also said atwater 
began receiving radiation treatment wednesday 
the state newspaper in columbia citing close friends of 
atwater and the news amp courier of charleston citing a source 
close to the situation reported the discovery of a second tumor

sure whether its a new tumor or part of the old tumor

a friend described atwater who managed president bushs 1988 
campaign as very very weak

in and out of the hospital repeatedly for treatment of ailments

until this week however doctors thought the small tumor in the 
right side of his brain was virtually gone on thursday rnc chief

iraq has soviet bombers capable of delivering 
chemical and conventional weapons with pinpoint precision anywhere 
in the persian gulf and eastern mediterranean janes defense 
weekly reported saturday 
the sukhoi su24 fencer lowlevel strike bombers present the 
usled multinational force in the persian gulf with its gravest 
military threat janes said in its aug 18 issue 
us military intelligence sources estimate that the iraqi air 
force has about 10 of the aircraft the magazine said 
it said the su24 fencer is similar to the us f111 and has a 
combat range of about 650 miles without the need to refuel 
with a midair refueling capability almost certainly possessed 
by the iraqis range would be limited only by the endurance of its 
twoman crew said the magazine 
although primarily designed to attack land targets janes said 
the aircraft could also be used against ships it can carry the 
full range of soviet tactical weapons many of which are in iraqi 
hands it said 
in capable hands it is a formidable weapon although the iraqi 
air forces ability to master its operation is under some doubt 
the janes article said 
us intelligence sources believe iraq has had fencers since the 
beginning of the year but it is not known whether they are owned by 
iraq or on loan from the soviet union the magazine said 
iraq which signed a friendship treaty with the soviet union in 
1972 has long wanted the su24 but experts believe moscow refused 
to supply them out of fears of destabilizing the middle east 
janes said 
the magazine said it is likely that moscow under pressure from 
iraq to supply intermediaterange missiles instead agreed to 
supply the fencers

a new political reform group believes 
thousands of americans are willing to spend 3 each to become 
better citizens 
the center for national independence in politics has set up a 
900number telephone line to take orders for the voters 
selfdefense manual an eightpage pamphlet small enough to fit 
in a shirt pocket 
its purpose to give voters a way to get around the 
manipulations of todays political campaigns to see behind the 
commercials and gimmicks 
in addition the 3 call to 1900820cnip produces a list 
showing how six national groups conservative liberal business 
labor environmental and defense rate the callers senators and 
representatives 
also provided is a breakdown of how much money the lawmakers 
have been given by political action committees representing 
agriculture business the health industry labor and professional 
ideological and political groups 
the manual is directed to the person who is frustrated out 
there cnip president richard kimball said in an interview last 
week we figure were going to have five minutes of their 
attention 
the pamphlet is cnips first project the organization based in 
tucson ariz and supported largely by foundations is nonprofit 
and bipartisan 
former sens william proxmire dwis and barry goldwater 
rariz are among the founders former presidents jimmy carter and 
gerald ford are honorary cofounders 
kimball ran unsuccessfully in 1986 against sen john mccain 
rariz 
he says he feels embarrassed to confess that he spent much of 
his time raising money so i could put out a commercial showing 
myself feeding carrots to horses campaign advisers had told him 
voters would feel kindly toward a candidate seen as a horselover 
and projecting an arizona image 
that is dangerous stuff in a democracy kimball now says 
so he set out to find a way to educate voters on ways to combat 
modern campaign technologies cnip resulted 
the manual advises on methods to cut through campaign posturing 
get information analyze commercials sift emotional appeals 
measure the ratio of meat to mush 
you must remember that elected officials are nothing more than 
temporary hired help it says view their campaigns as job 
applications ask if the candidates are giving you the employer 
the information you need in order to hire wisely 
callers get one copy another is sent to a library in their 
state 
kimballs concern is deadly serious 
throughout the world he writes in the pamphlet people 
struggle in the streets for a small measure of democracy while 
here in the nation of its birth it has begun to die

the sergeant is halfway done with digging 
his first foxhole on his first night in the arabian desert when 
word comes to pull back 
he swings his shovel in protest until the reason transmitted by 
whisper makes its way down the line the platoon is out of 
position 
were too far out in front of the rest of the company the 
sergeant says they could be firing and killing us 
the shovels are put away rucksacks are quickly packed and the 
platoon within minutes makes a short retreat guided to a new site 
by a dim fluorescent signal flashed by a sister platoon several 
hundred yards away 
platoon 22 the second platoon of the 82nd airborne divisions 
2nd brigade digs in again 
a few minutes later the company commander explains to a 
reporter that the platoon had taken position far enough out front 
to be hit by friendly mortar and machine gun fire the captain 
isnt happy but shrugs it off 
hes our newest platoon leader he said its good to get 
him out here to practice 
friday nights exercises gave the troops a chance to practice on 
the first night the saudi government allowed american troops to 
train long after sundown more such drills including some joint 
exercises with saudi troops are planned 
the first night of desert training witnessed by two reporters 
and a photographer demonstrated the formidable challenges american 
forces would face in a desert war in the middle east and it 
provided journalists the first chance to spend extended time with 
some of the young men who would fight that war 
they are a diverse group from throughout america some eager to 
fight some terrified by the prospect but all share a similar hope 
that the crisis will soon be resolved either through combat or 
diplomacy 
were here sweating because our lives may depend on it said 
one private who carried a 50pound pack through 95degree evening 
heat but its really not up to us our lives are in the 
politicians hands 
the sun was just beginning its descent when the three platoons 
began the exercise walking in a vshaped formation roughly three 
miles into the seemingly endless arabian desert as the sun dropped 
off the horizon a herd of camels traipsed past the curious 
americans 
the need to carry more water makes the soldiers packs extra 
heavy during a break a 20yearold medic from newburgh ny 
lightens his pack a bit by taking a few gulps the infantrymen he 
is there to help drop into a circular perimeter their weapons 
aimed across the darkening terrain 
finding the courage is tough its scary out here the 
medic says but youve got to swallow that and go out and do it 
inside his bag are needles with antidotes to certain chemical 
weapons the medic prays they will not be needed 
we just want to go back to the states and be with our kids 
he says 
none of a dozen soldiers interviewed under the sparkling desert 
sky has any idea when the trip home will be some ask aloud whether 
they will make it most hope diplomacy convinces iraq to leave 
kuwait a few would rather take on saddam husseins forces now 
if it would get us home faster then lets go kick him out of 
kuwait one private says what we have now is hurry up and 
wait its frustrating 
it is so dark that one can move around virtually unnoticed so 
quiet that whispers can be heard much of the talk is idle chatter 
the sky is just like the sky back home one soldier says to 
his companion in a twoman foxhole 
the response but it just isnt the same unless im sitting 
out on my back porch 
a few yards away another soldier tells a passerby my wife is 
having our baby in five weeks i wish i could just say hello 
a radioman with the medic begins a sentence saying if saddam 
doesnt pull out of kuwait the medic completes the thought 
hell be squished like a grape 
the men are barely in their foxholes when they are instructed to 
head back to their transport trucks a nearly threemile walk in 
the pitch black night 
those in the back of the line can see the shadows of just the 
few men ahead in training one sergeant says soldiers have been 
known to stop thinking a tree several feet ahead in the darkness 
is the man they are supposed to follow 
that cuts you off from the front he says and if you get 
cut off you die 
the saudi desert has no trees but the going is treacherous in 
the dark because of short sharp shrubs underfoot and small dunes 
that turn a walk to a stumble 
during the trek most of the soldiers say they understand that 
they must be here and are ready to fight to defend the saudi 
kingdom these are the troops airborne paratroopers who arrived 
first when there was little firepower to back them up 
when they called us out we thought we were going to drop 
right into a war the medic says 
helicopters on night flights pass in the distance a reminder 
that much more us firepower is in the region now 
as they wait the 82nd airborne forces train about 12 hours a 
day they have some complaints the lack of mail is the biggest 
but say morale is high they complain largely because there is 
little else to do 
its army tradition one sergeant says with a laugh but 
were fine 
a reporter keeps asking what it would be like to fight in the 
desert the soldiers keep asking what its like back home 
please tell them well be back a lieutenant says we just 
dont know when

saudi arabias foreign minister said 
saturday the united nations is considering joining in military 
action to enforce its sanctions against iraq 
prince saud alfaisal also ruled out a diplomatic solution to 
the persian gulf crisis unless iraq withdraws its troops from 
kuwait and reinstates the emir who was deposed in the aug 2 
invasion 
we are hoping ardently hoping that military action will be 
avoided saud said in an interview with western and saudi 
journalists 
but he added unless the two principals are accepted by iraq 
i dont see any prospects for a diplomatic solution 
that is the only way it can be resolved there is absolutely 
no other way he added 
the reporters were invited by the saudi government to travel to 
this red sea city about 1000 miles from where thousands of us 
troops and other members of a multinational force are deploying on 
the persian gulf 
saud said his country supports actions by the united nations to 
strengthen its economic boycott of iraq 
the united nations has endorsed a total boycott of iraq and the 
united states and britain have moved to enforce those sanctions 
using naval forces to stop ships believed to be carrying goods to 
or from iraq 
saud indicated the action could soon involve a multinational 
force under the auspices of the un 
the united nations now is in consultation to see if some 
action more than the boycott is required and we support that 
action and we hope it will be a further signal to iraq to respond 
to the international communitys conviction that they have to 
withdraw from kuwait he said 
asked what kind of action saud said they are considering 
military action a saudi official explained that saud was 
referring to possible military enforcement of a blockade 
saud who just returned from washington and was expected to meet 
with defense secretary dick cheney this weekend refused to discuss 
any specific saudi conditions under which the united states has 
agreed to send more than 50000 troops to the desert kingdom 
he said foreign troops arrived at saudi arabias request and 
added that the oilrich kingdom is willing to help pay for the cost 
of the deployment 
saudi arabia will as it does contribute its share for the 
defense of saudi arabia he said 
saud added that the us forces along with contingents from 
egypt britain and other countries arrived at the request of 
saudi arabia and they will leave at the request of saudi arabia 
the number of troops in saudi arabia by no means comes close 
to the number of troops in iraq he added 
saud said iraq has between 120000 and 160000 men in kuwait and 
has mobilized one million people 
saud would not say how long he expected american troops to 
remain in saudi arabia but said it is up to iraq to move to end 
the crisis 
the ball is in their court he said

guardsman and began treating him for a scorpion sting 
nearly 1400 members of the georgia army national guards 48th 
infantry brigade mechanized spent three weeks in the california 
desert last month defending the imaginary country of mojavia 
against invaders with black berets 
the 48th serves as a backup for the 24th infantry division 
mechanized at fort stewart ga which is deploying troops and 
equipment to the saudi arabian desert to defend the oil kingdom 
against a possible iraqi attack 
i spent a week in the desert interviewing and photographing the 
parttime soldiers as a staff sergeant in the guards 124th public 
affairs detachment 
at the same time my 23yearold son emory was halfway around 
the world training in a middle east desert with combat engineers 
that mission was halted after saddam husseins troops invaded 
kuwait 
despite a regimen of pushups situps and sixmile runs i found 
it difficult to walk very far in the desert heat with a 70pound 
rucksack a kevlar helmet a gas mask two canteens a firstaid 
pouch and two ammo pouches stuffed with plastic bags containing 
powdered milk and slimfast a concession to my own battle of the 
bulge 
the importance of water shade and portable toilets quickly 
became apparent 
we drank water constantly to avoid dehydration many guardsmen 
carried insulated water bottles and larger containers were placed 
in key locations and lashed to nearly all vehicles 
i drank about a quart of water every hour and never passed up an 
opportunity to top off my canteens 
the desert heat was oppressive but a constant breeze was 
blowing and we were fairly comfortable in the shade we were 
surrounded from horizon to horizon by sand and rocky peaks small 
creosote bushes dotted the landscape 
i saw a coyote ambling across the desert one morning but no 
other wildlife i shook my boots each morning for scorpions 
pfc dawn doyle an operating room technician with a macon 
medical unit had some definite plans for her return 
ill spend three hours in the shower and then sleep for about 
24 hours she said then ill think about going out for a 
pizza 
the medics stayed busy treating the guard members for heat 
exhaustion cuts and kidney stones georgians are susceptible to 
kidney stones because of high calcium levels in their water 
doctors said dehydration and possibly the rough ride across the 
desert triggered dozens of painful kidney stone attacks 
a common greeting in the mojave was hey i passed my stone 
the army placed portable toilets in the mojave for the 
convenience of soldiers and to protect the desert environment the 
portable johns had the word leroy stenciled on the door 
when one got crushed by a tank someone put up a sign that said 
who killed leroy 
the guard members were issued sunscreen and goggles to protect 
their eyes from the sand and sun they had to keep their sleeves 
rolled down to avoid sunburn 
unaware of the sleeve policy i kept mine rolled up for half a 
day and wound up with arms as red as boiled lobsters 
i also lost my goggles and my eyes became irritated while riding 
in a truck with no windshield i eventually had to go to an aid 
station to have them flushed out and treated 
during lulls the medics nurses and doctors catnapped in the 
shade of truck when patients arrived they examined them on canvas 
litters set up beneath a camouflage net 
everyone wore sensors that sound an alarm when hit by a laser 
beam the sensors also were attached to vehicles the soldiers 
m16 rifles and cannons fired blanks for a realistic sound but 
also shot safe laser beams that triggered the sensors 
dead and wounded soldiers had to sit in a bone yard 
for up to 12 hours and their units had to send replacements and 
fill out war casualty forms 
during the 48ths desert sojourn its members traveled through 
such places as portapotty pass john wayne pass the valley of 
death coyote canyon and dead mans pass 
during the exercise we dined on trations which are packed in 
large metal containers that are heated before serving or mres 
meals ready to eat which come in brown plastic pouches and 
contain not only food and a plastic spoon but accessories such as 
instant coffee salt sugar chewing gum and toilet paper 
one day i hitched a ride with members of the 848th engineer 
company from douglas a small farming town in south georgia they 
were camped at the foot of a small mountain 
the engineers let me use a cot and we all went to sleep beneath 
a clear sky studded with millions of stars 
the next day they packed their gear into tan trailers and 
trucks and disappeared in a cloud of dust as he bumped along in 
the heat staff sgt roy butler was overcome by the mojaves beauty 
and vastness and began to sing an old baptist hymn 
we need a savior in times like this we need an anchor he

the 370000 red army soldiers in 
east germany have few military duties these days so they spend a 
lot of time deciding what to buy with the windfall west germany 
just handed them 
like east germans the soviet troopers were allowed to trade 
savings in east german marks for west german money when the 
currencies merged july 1 since then they have been paid in west 
german marks 
several recruits walking along a road outside potsdam on a hot 
summer day spoke with a western reporter about their new wealth 
and their plans for it 
dmitri wants a tape deck valery prefers a video recorder and 
alexei has his mind set on a car vladimir said he bought his niece 
really good gifts 
things are better for us now because we have west german marks 
and there are many things to buy said dmitri a 20yearold 
sergeant from the ukraine 
east germany pays the cost of keeping soviet troops in this 
former cornerstone of the warsaw pact the only difference now is 
that the money is paid in west german marks instead of the 
nowdefunct east mark 
a red army private gets only the equivalent of 15 a month a 
sergeant earns twice that and officers pay starts at about 625 a 
fortune in soviet terms 
at the black market rate in the soviet union even a privates 
pay is worth about 154 rubles more than half the average soviet 
monthly wage of 250 rubles 
in potsdam however it doesnt buy many 250 plates of herring 
washed down with 60cent colas and the first flush of spending has 
passed 
they are buying a lot less now said clark brutler who 
sells socks in the outdoor market they just dont have as much 
money anymore 
many have their eyes on luxury electronic goods or cars but 
even used cars are far beyond the means of lowranking soldiers 
some have sold weapons to raise cash for highpriced items 
so far this year west berlin police have confiscated 90 rifles 
pistols and revolvers 135 pounds of explosives 165 grenades and 
four grenade launchers they said most were of soviet origin 
among the places weapons were seized was a park in east germany 
just outside west berlin where police said soviet soldiers were 
selling arms to west berliners 
soviet military hats coats and badges are peddled to tourists 
at the brandenburg gate and the former us checkpoint charlie 
along the berlin wall 
the soviet military dismisses reports that ordinary soldiers can 
barely survive on their pay 
soldiers get everything medicine free cigarettes taken 
care of by the soviet state said major karen streltschemnya a 
political officer at the soviet mission in east berlin deutsche 
marks are for snacks not to live on 
soviet officers can afford to eat well in their villas on their 
wooded base surrounded by a high white wall their wives return 
from shopping trips with heaping baskets of west german hams 
cheeses and other delicacies 
most of the thousands of soviet soldiers assigned to potsdam 
live in barracks that wind along a twolane road leading west from 
the city their lives are relatively spartan but probably better 
than they can expect as civilians back home where unemployment is 
growing and housing is scarce 
several red army soldiers have deserted their units and gone to 
west germany whose liberal asylum laws may apply to them 
red star the soviet military newspaper declared recently that 
fleeing to west germany was desertion with all its resulting 
consequences 
asylum is an issue each one of us thinks about but it is up 
to each soldier to make his own decision said oleg a ukrainian 
private 
potsdam has not experienced the kind of antagonism toward soviet 
troops seen elsewhere in east germany since that countrys 
stalinist government collapsed in november 
in many communities signs like russen raus russians out 
are common renate kern who has lived next to soviet military 
personnel for 22 years said they are the best neighbors weve 
never had any trouble they stay for a few years and then go home

tension mounted today over the fate of westerners trapped in 
iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait and a record number of arabs fled 
into jordan 
today iraq warned that foreign nationals would be among the 
first to feel the pinch as the international embargo created 
shortages of critical supplies iraq imports about threequarters 
of its food 
in a televised statement iraq called military enforcement of 
the international embargo against it an act of war and demanded 
an end to it european and american diplomats expressed anxiety in 
the wake of fridays announcement from iraq that foreigners from 
aggressive nations would be kept in iraq as long as the threat 
of war persisted 
by midday today an official at the jordanian border post of 
ruweishid said 4000 foreigners had crossed from iraq and 
thousands more were lined up a day earlier a record 22300 
foreigners had crossed he said nearly all were arabs the 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
fridays iraqi threat against the foreign nationals was 
delivered by iraqs parliamentary speaker sadi mahdi saleh he 
said the foreigners not allowed to leave iraq would be housed in 
civilian and military institutions around iraq 
the people of iraq have decided to play host to the citizens 
of these aggressive nations as long as iraq remains threatened with 
an aggressive war he added the statement carried by the 
official iraqi news agency was monitored in nicosia cyprus 
britain today called threats against foreigners by the iraqis 
unlawful and inhuman 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said the iraqi ambassador 
had been summoned to the foreign office to underline our grave 
concern and to relay to his authorities the need for immediate 
clarification 
in paris france summoned the iraqi ambassador to warn that 
serious consequences would result if steps are not taken to 
protect the 560 french nationals in iraq and kuwait 
a foreign ministry source said it was not whether french 
nationals would fall under the iraqi directive concerning citizens 
of aggressive nations 
no orders have been given for french people in kuwait to 
assemble at hotels as were given on thursday for american and 
british nationals the source said 
the french foreign ministry said that about 290 french citizens 
are being held in iraq and another 270 in kuwait today was the 
third time in two weeks the iraqi ambassador to paris has been 
summoned to the foreign ministry to discuss their fate 
italian newspapers reported today that more than 300 italians 
trapped in iraq say they are being held against their will and have 
appealed for help from the italian government 
in a telex sent via the italian embassy in baghdad the italians 
described their situation as grave and asked the government to 
help get them out 
we are blocked in iraq against our will help us return to 
italy newspapers quoted the telex as saying 
italys foreign ministry said it was doing all it could to work 
for the release of italian citizens and was turning to the united 
nations and the red cross for help 
on friday the united nations security council expressed concern 
about the fate of the trapped foreigners and asked 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to take steps to help 
them 
the white house was silent about iraqs threat on friday and 
president bush refused to answer reporters questions this morning 
but the state department has consistently expressed concern about 
the americans 
fear mounted again friday after 35 us citizens were removed 
from the rashid hotel in baghdad and taken to an undisclosed 
location most likely another hotel white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said we consider it a matter of serious concern 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat said 
on friday that approximately 3000 americans in iraq and kuwait 
would not be harmed 
meanwhile the exodus by arab nationals from iraq swelled to its 
highest levels yet 
the jordanian border official at ruweishid said fridays 
crossing of 22300 was the biggest in a single day since the exodus 
began prompted by iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
the border official said those who crossed today were arab 
nationals mainly egyptian except for two indians with british 
passports 
a group of 225 soviet citizens from kuwait were among the 
thousands who crossed into jordan late friday the group was driven 
from the border to ammans airport and boarded a plane for moscow 
early today 
the crush at ruweishid is so great that there are not enough 
buses to transport the evacuees across jordan on the way to their 
countries associated press photographer martin cleaver in 
ruweishid said hundreds of trucks had been commandeered to help in 
the evacuation 
the continuing influx of egyptians into jordan indicated that 
they were not considered by the iraqis as being citizens of an 
aggressive nation even though egypt has sent troops to help 
defend saudi arabia against any iraqi attack 
the official at ruweishid said out of 4000 arabs who crossed 
today 3300 were egyptians he said another 7000 egyptians had 
crossed the previous day 
the egyptians are moving south to port of aqaba after crossing 
the border thousands are reported to be waiting there for ferries 
to carry them home across the red sea 
many other foreigners arabs and a handful of westerners were 
escaping via the saudi border on friday thirteen carloads of 
american and other refugees made a dramatic escape from kuwait 
through the desert a californian member of the convoy said 
it was a hectic rather perilous drive past iraqi checkpoints 
and through uninhabited desert regions between kuwait and saudi 
arabia stephanie mcgehee 37 said after the group made it over 
the border friday 
the total number of people in the 13car convoy was not 
immediately clear although the nine people in ms mcgehees car 
included two other americans a canadian a briton and four 
indians she said

baghdad today condemned the us economic blockade on iraq as an 
act of war and said that the thousands of foreigners it holds will 
suffer along with iraqis as shortages of food and medicine develop 
iraq which imports threefourths of its food said iraqi and 
foreign babies and elderly people will be the first to feel the 
effect as the nation makes sure that its food goes to its hundreds 
of thousands of soldiers first 
the baghdad government holds 3000 americans 4000 britons and 
about 14000 other westerners among the more than 2 million 
foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait when iraqs president saddam 
hussein invaded kuwait on aug 2 
there was no indication in todays statement that the foreigners 
would be allowed to leave iraq or iraqioccupied kuwait instead 
it focused on how the foreigners would face deprivation if the 
embargo is maintained 
iraq has raised the stakes in the persian gulf crisis by saying 
it will hold captive americans as a shield and by diverting troops 
pulled back from the iranian frontier to focus on its confrontation 
with us and arab forces 
iraqs army newspaper today reiterated earlier threats to use 
weapons of mass destruction against any attacker iraqs 
arsenal is known to include chemical weapons and longrange 
missiles 
the united states today planned to step up its mobilization 
against the iraqi invasion of kuwait by calling up military 
reservists and ordering us civilian airlines to help fly troops 
and cargo to saudi arabia 
todays statement on iraqi television was made by iraqs 
ministry of labor and social affairs it suggested that some of the 
european nationals were already feeling the effects of the 
neartotal cutoff of supplies 
because of the embargo food cannot be secured for aged 
persons in the manner that we wish the statement said this 
experience has already affected the british people particularly 
there are children among the foreigners and iraq suggested they 
would be treated the same as iraqi children in shortages 
if there were to be any reduction in the necessities of 
babies then the same calamity affecting the iraqi newborn will 
affect similarly the foreign babies said an iraqi statement 
it said the united states and its allies have surpassed the 
unmandated sanctions against iraq by enforcing a military 
embargo including food and medicine and that is considered an act 
of war 
the statement was read by an unidentified announcer and 
translated by cable news network and the associated press 
in egypt suez canal personnel picked up radio signals 
indicating that an american warship in the mediterranean sea was 
checking the itineraries of commercial vessels approaching or 
leaving egypts port said at the canals northern entrance a 
canal official said on condition of anonymity 
the report came a day after us navy commanders operating under 
new orders to intercept ships to or from iraq stopped two iraqi 
vessels off the coast of bahrain the ships were allowed to proceed 
after us forces determined they carried no goods and they were 
not boarded the pentagon said 
washington also joined with the four other permanent members of 
the un security council in an unprecedented meeting to discuss an 
expanded un military role to stop any further advance by iraqi 
president saddam hussein who sent forces into kuwait 16 days ago 
in a dispute over oil land and money 
the us move to interdict ships has drawn criticism the latest 
coming from libyan leader moammar gadhafi the official libyan news 
agency jana said gadhafi wrote to the un secretarygeneral to 
protest the move as illegal 
in jiddah saudi arabias foreign minister prince saud 
alfaisal said today he saw no prospects for a diplomatic solution 
unless iraq withdraws its troops from kuwait and reinstates the 
emir who was deposed in the invasion 
that is the only way it can be resolved there is absolutely 
no other way prince saud said in an interview with western and 
saudi journalists 
on friday the speaker of iraqs parliament said iraq would hold 
all foreigners from aggressive nations until the threat of war 
against his country ends he said they would be spread throughout 
the country housed in military and civilian targets 
the white house refused comment friday on baghdads 
announcement and president bush refused to answer reporters 
questions this morning before fridays announcement from iraq 
bush said iraqi attempts to move american civilians around iraq and 
kuwait violated international law 
in an editorial the iraqi army daily alqaddasiyah said all 
weapons at baghdads disposal including those of mass 
destruction would be awaiting anyone who is thinking of 
aggression and turn him into fragmentsiraq used chemical weapons 
during its war with iran 
iran said today it freed 1000 iraqi prisoners of war 
reciprocating for an iraqi move a day earlier the baghdad 
government this week made peace overtures to iran with an eye 
toward switching troops from the iranian border to occupied kuwait 
and the saudi border it began withdrawing some of the 300000 
iraqi soldiers there friday 
the alqaddasiyah editorial also said today the 30 divisions 
facing iran an estimated 300000 troops would now be used to 
bolster iraqi formations in the south it was the first word from 
an official publication that baghdad would redeploy forces freed 
from the iranian border 
iran and iraq fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988 but peace 
talks have foundered since then and this weeks initiative by iraq 
is aimed at reaching a permanent settlement

persian gulf crisis erupted with iraqs takeover of kuwait 
as in 1973 and in 1979 the united states faces rising oil 
prices and though theres no immediate prospect of those kinds of 
shortages they could come eventually the earlier oil shocks were 
major factors in triggering recessions the economy already is 
slowing and the current turmoil in the persian gulf can only make 
it worse 
despite what happened before and despite the virtual certainty 
that something similar would happen again us efforts at energy 
discipline were shelved for most of a decade ronald reagans 
energy policy was to leave it alone and let the market rule that 
sufficed while middle east oil was plentiful and relatively cheap 
now the problem is back 
we have spent the last decade basking in the glow of falling 
real energy prices sen albert gore jr dtenn said before 
the senate passed its energy policy bill early this month we 
have been lulled into a complacency that cannot last 
during the reagan administration the department of energys 
conservation budget was slashed by twothirds 
when imported oil prices fell in 1986 us production fell 
too at those prices many domestic producers couldnt compete and 
there was no incentive to keep going us oil production is down 
by about 20 percent since 1985 at 71 million barrels a day june 
production was the lowest on record 
remnants of the emergency programs that grew out of the crises 
of the 1970s have put the united states in better shape to deal 
with the impact of the persian gulf situation 
one of those legacies is the emergency petroleum reserve a big 
enough stockpile to temporarily cushion against shortages it could 
be a lot bigger if the government hadnt stopped buying during five 
of the reagan years a budgetcutting move that could prove 
expensive 
the 1987 tanker war in the persian gulf threatened oil supplies 
and us warships were sent to protect the supply lines that 
costly operation isnt calculated into the price of oil nor is 
this one they go onto the tax bill not the price at the pump 
sen frank h murkowski ralaska calculated that counting the 
cost of earlier military operations the true price of imported oil 
comes to 52 a barrel that hypothetical price tag doesnt include 
the cost of the massive us military buildup in saudi arabia and 
the persian gulf 
figured that way the price is soaring with the us military 
deployment in saudi arabia and the gulf this is not a freebie 
out there in terms of the expenditure president bush said 
tuesday saying he could not estimate the cost or the duration of 
the operation 
but people dont count those costs the way they count the cost 
of a gallon of gasoline 
oil imports are a major factor in the us trade deficit james 
schlesinger a former secretary of energy and of defense says the 
price will hit 75 billion next year swelling to over 100 billion 
a year by the mid1990s if past trends continue 
through it all us energy policy has shifted and drifted 
richard m nixons project independence made little headway toward 
the goal in its name jimmy carter said the quest to curb energy 
dependence was the moral equivalent of war his program of 
conservation and production incentives fees taxes and penalties 
didnt last long the reagan administration relied on the 
marketplace the bush administration still is at work on its energy 
strategy due later this year 
and as carter notes the arab oil suppliers know only too well 
that we now have no effective national energy policy nor any 
commitment to adopt one 
legislation to declare that oil imports of 50 percent represent 
a peril point for us security and to require emergency 
action to keep them lower is part of a new national energy security 
act passed by the senate just before its august recess two days 
after iraq invaded kuwait the timing was coincidental the bill 
was drafted primarily to deal with global warming not oil wars 
a measure seeking to restrain oil imports was defeated by the 
senate in 1987 after the last persian gulf crisis had subsided 
conservation production incentives and new technologies to 
develop alternative energy sources all have been components in the 
successive strategies that were shaped and shelved after the 
earlier oil shocks 
the department of energy put together a quickhit package of 
steps to boost production and promote conservation to offset the 
loss of imports from kuwait and iraq 
but between oil crises the tendency has been to act as though 
there wouldnt be another one

a testy president bush brushing off 
reporters questions said saturday that he no longer will discuss 
serious matters like the persian gulf crisis while playing golf 
the president displayed clear misgivings about the image he was 
projecting by juggling his annual endofaugust vacation with a 
massive us military buildup against iraq in the middle east 
bush cut off reporters inquiries on the first tee as he set out 
on an early morning round of golf 
asked if he had been in touch with the white house situation 
room the president snapped i talk to them every morning at 530 
and im not going to take any more comments up here though 
lets go said bush to his golf partners including son 
george w bush who chided reporters for talking during his back 
swing 
bushs ire may have been sparked by footage shown on television 
networks of some lighthearted remarks the president made on the 
golf course friday asked then if he had signed rules of engagement 
for us naval forces in the gulf bush quipped i havent done 
anything yet i just got up 
he then sped off in his golf cart 
when he finished saturdays speedy round on the cape arundel 
golf course a reporter asked the president if he was still mad 
at the media 
ive never been mad at you i just dont like taking questions 
on serious matters on my vacation he said 
its just not a good thing to keep doing it like this but 
ill try to be available said bush who has held two formal news 
conferences and two informal ones since he came to maine aug 10 on 
a 25day vacation 
one of those news conferences was at the white house when the 
president returned to washington for a pentagon briefing on the 
gulf crisis he is also returning to washington sunday night for a 
meeting monday with energy secretary james watkins to discuss the 
impact on us energy reserves and to address the veterans of 
foreign war convention in baltimore 
i think weve been readily available to the press probably 
more so than most and ill try to continue that said bush 
but it just doesnt seem appropriate and so i hope youll 
understand if i when im recreating will recreate and then when 
were working which im trying to do up here also ill work 
hard the president said 
bush regularly has answered reporters questions from the first 
tees during his golf outings a media pool of about 15 reporters 
photographers and broadcast crews travels in his motorcade and is 
escorted out to watch his performance at the first tee the ninth 
green and 10th tee and the 18th hole 
when reporters persisted in asking questions saturday bushs 
eldest son rose to his fathers defense 
hey hey sir could you wait until we finish hitting at 
least my game is really bad but when youre talking in the back 
swing it gets even worse said bush a partowner of the texas 
rangers

an unprecedented pentagon move to press 
civilian aircraft into service for the military buildup in the 
middle east should not disrupt commercial air traffic a federal 
transportation official said 
however some airlines representatives expressed uncertainty on 
the effects of the decision announced friday 
although there have been charters this is the first time part 
of the us civil air fleet has been diverted under a plan 
conceived in the 1950s 
the planes are owned by 16 airlines which also will be 
providing the crews to operate them the airlift support is 
expected to be needed for several weeks the pentagon said 
air force gen hansford t johnson commander of the us 
transportation command and military airlift command announced 
friday that he would activate the first stage of the civilian 
reserve air fleet to meet the growing airlift requirements for 
us forces 
his decision enables the callup of as many as 38 aircraft to 
carry soldiers and cargo to the persian gulf region 
stages two and three if activated could deploy as many as 300 
commercial planes for military use the aircraft would come from 
passenger and cargo airlines 
stage one is not expected to disrupt civilian air traffic said 
elaine l chao us deputy secretary of transportation 
chao and johnson were in st louis to attend a transportation 
meeting 
johnson said activation of the civilian reserve air fleet was 
necessary because an insufficient number of commercial airplanes 
had been volunteered for the middle east effort 
the armed forces have been using as many as 24 civilian planes 
daily 10 volunteers and 14 that were previously under government 
contract johnson said 
bob gibbons director of media relations for eagan minnbased 
northwest airlines said saturday weve been asked to provide 
airplanes and we will 
he acknowledged that the decision takes our airplanes out of 
circulation but added well do our best to provide our 
scheduled service 
pam blase a spokeswoman for trans world airlines said she did 
not know how twa might be affected by the new call 
i can only comment that it is a military matter and its not 
appropriate for us to comment at this time she said friday 
united airlines is one of the largest participants in the us 
fleet program with 62 planes committed company spokesman rob 
doughty said 
he could not confirm whether united had been called on to 
provide any planes for the stage one callup but added we do 
not anticipate disruptions to our schedule 
t allan mcartor a senior vice president for federal express 
corp said his company had the largest fleet participating in the 
civil reserve air fleet but he would give no specific numbers 
federal express planes flew passenger and cargo missions this 
week for the middle east operation dubbed operation desert shield 
it was a limited number it did not disrupt normal service at 
all said mcartor who served as administrator of the federal 
aviation administration from 1987 to 1989 
the company uses only pilots and crew members who wish to go 
naturally theres an element of risk he said we dont feel 
it poses risk that cant be managed well 
mcartor said the armed forces and the private transportation 
sector had a successful partnership but theres a need for 
continued improvement 
the military cant expect companies so highly integrated and 
complex to respond on short notice indefinitely naturally we 
respond to a national emergency but we need to plan together he 
said 
transportation command coordinates all transportation of 
soldiers and equipment for military operations a branch of the 
transportation command the military airlift command handles 
passenger and cargo airlift scott air force base near belleville 
is the headquarters for both commands 
the transportation meeting which focused on cooperation 
between the military and private industry was scheduled months 
ago with the middle east trouble the timing and the topic could 
not be more relevant chao said 
our global responsibilities are too great and too diversified 
to depend on the military alone she said

iraq said today the economic embargo 
against it is an act of war and that foreign nationals it holds 
will suffer along with iraqis if shortages of food and medicine 
develop 
iraq imports about threequarters of its food 
the baghdad government holds 3000 americans 4000 britons and 
about 14000 other westerners among the more than 2 million 
foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait when saddam sent forces into 
the small oil state on aug 2 
there was no indication in todays statement carried on iraqi 
television that the foreigners would be allowed to leave iraq or 
iraqioccupied kuwait instead it focused on how the foreigners 
would face deprivation if the embargo is maintained 
food supplies in iraq will be distributed to the military on a 
priority basis because they are the shield of the nation the 
statement said 
the iraqis suggested that foreigners whose countries had 
experienced wars would understand the iraqi decision to reserve 
needed supplies for its military 
the peoples of europe in particular the british have gone 
through such an experience or something resembling it before 
the statement said 
children and the elderly among the foreign nationals would feel 
the effects of shortages along with their iraqi counterparts it 
said 
because of the embargo food cannot be secured for aged 
persons in the manner that we wish the statement said if 
there were to be any reduction in the necessities of babies then 
the same calamity affecting the iraqi newborn will affect similarly 
the foreign babies 
iraq demanded an immediate end to the embargo which was 
approved by the united nations security council in the wake of the 
invasion it also accused the united states of being largely 
responsible for the sanctions 
the right solution is for the embargo to end which the united 
states deliberately imposed on the iraqis it said president 
bush has authorized the interdiction of shipments to iraq a move 
that has drawn criticism from some other nations 
the military embargo including food and medicine is 
considered an act of war in accordance with international custom 
and international law the statement said 
iraq blamed the united states and its allies for the crisis in 
the persian gulf 
iraq did not attack the west it said iraq is a peaceful 
nation 
todays statement came one day after the speaker of iraqs 
parliament said iraq would hold all foreigners from aggressive 
nations until the threat of war against his country ends he said 
they would be spread throughout the country housed in military and 
civilian targets 
the iraqi parliament speaker sadi mahdi saleh said friday the 
foreigners would be held as long as the threat of war persists a 
multinational force of thousands of troops spearheaded by the 
united states has been deployed in saudi arabia to defend it 
against possible iraqi attack 
the people of iraq have decided to play host to the citizens 
of these aggressive nations as long as iraq remains threatened with 
an aggressive war the iraqi official said then 
fridays iraqi statement drew a strong response today from 
france and britain france summoned iraqs ambassador to warn of 
serious consequences if french citizens were not protected and 
britain denounced threats against foreign nationals as completely 
unacceptable 
also the united nations security council expressed concern 
about foreign nationals in iraq and kuwait and asked 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on friday to take action 
to help them 
the white house kept silent about baghdads announcement 
regarding the foreigners on friday and this morning president 
bush refused to answer reporters questions about the persian gulf 
crisis 
before fridays iraqi announcement however bush had said iraqi 
attempts to move american civilians around iraq and kuwait violated 
international law 
fears for the safety of americans was heightened after 35 us 
citizens were removed from the rashid hotel in baghdad and taken to 
an undisclosed location most likely another hotel white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday we consider it a matter 
of serious concern

the white house said today that 
iraqs holding american and other foreign citizens is totally 
unacceptable the administration decried the use of innocent 
civilians as pawns in saddam husseins stand against 
international sanctions 
president bush called on iraq to immediately reconsider its 
refusal to let the foreigners including an estimated 3000 
americans leave 
the white house in a statement by press secretary marlin 
fitzwater also said it was deeply concerned by todays 
announcement from baghdad that the iraqi government may withhold 
food from the foreigners 
fitzwater said iraqs announcement that it would not allow 
citizens from aggressive nations to leave is totally 
unacceptable 
he said bush is deeply troubled by the indication that iraqi 
authorities intend to relocate these individuals within iraq 
against their will 
the use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what iraq 
sees to be its selfinterest is contrary to international law and 
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct the 
spokesman said 
fitzwater said we urge that iraq immediately reconsider its 
refusal to allow any foreign national desiring to leave to do so 
without delay or condition 
he said iraq should take note of fridays statement by the 
united nations security council president expressing the 
councils concern and anxiety over the situation of foreign nations 
in iraq and kuwait and calling upon the secretary general to take 
all appropriate steps 
fitzwater did not specify what action the united states was 
prepared to take if the iraqis do not reverse course 
but he added the united states intends to consult with other 
governments with citizens being held in iraq and kuwait to 
determine what additional measures ought to be taken 
bush will return to washington earlier than planned sunday to 
meet with his national security advisers over dinner the white 
house said he is returning to the white house for the night and 
will meet with energy secretary james watkins monday morning to 
review the impact of the crisis on us oil reserves 
the vacation white house issued fitzwaters statement shortly 
after a spokesman for saddam hussein appeared on baghdad television 
calling the un economic embargo an act of war and warning 
that foreign nationals it holds will suffer along with iraqis if 
shortages of food and medicine develop 
fitzwater said deputy national security adviser robert gates 
called bush on his speedboat fidelity at 1130 am edt to discuss 
the iraqi statement and the administrations response 
the actions came as bush is readying a callup of us military 
reserves and the pentagon launched an unprecedented diversion of 
civilian aircraft to bolster the us military presence in the 
middle east 
bush teeing off at golf before 7 am today refused to answer 
reporters questions about the gulf crisis asked if he had been in 
touch with the white house situation room bush replied crisply 
i talk to them every morning at 530 and im not going to take 
any more comments up here 
although bush has decided to use reservists to fill in the ranks 
of military doctors cargo handlers and other specialists he is 
still weighing how many are needed to meet the persian gulf crisis 
white house officials said 
an army source today said the pentagons recommendation to call 
up reserves did not include a specific number but that as many as 
80000 armed services reservists and national guardsmen could be 
activated 
the 80000 figure is a tentative upper limit planning 
figure said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
source said the actual number of reserves called up surely will 
be less than that 
the source said also that the army has not received the goahead 
from the white house to begin any activation of reserves but that 
if the order came today the first group of reservists could be 
processed for action within 24 hours 
bush has the authority to activate up to 200000 reservists for 
90 days with the option of keeping them on active duty for another 
90 days 
defense secretary dick cheney refused to give a timetable for 
the us commitment saying en route to saudi arabia where well 
be a year or two from now i wouldnt want to speculate 
it is cheneys second trip to saudi arabia since iraqi forces 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
in the tense gulf region navy commanders stopped two iraqi 
vessels friday but let them proceed after us forces determined 
they were not carrying supplies for iraq an economic pariah since 
the occupation of kuwait the ships were not boarded 
the united states is acting under criticism from united nations 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar he said thursday that 
this countrys naval barricade to enforce un economic sanctions 
against iraq was undertaken without the authority of the un 
security council 
we believe its fully authorized white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater countered friday 
in another announcement the pentagon on friday said up to 38 
commercial airliners were being turned over to the military to haul 
troops and cargo although there have been charters this is the 
first time part of the us civil air fleet has been diverted under 
a plan conceived in the 1950s 
the decision was made by the commanderinchief of the us 
transportation command and military airlift command gen ht 
johnson to meet the growing airlift requirements for us 
forces deployed in the middle east a defense department statement 
said 
the planes are owned by 16 airlines which also will be 
providing the crews to operate them 
the airlift support is expected to be needed for several weeks 
the pentagon said 
fresh concerns were raised about the safety of americans after 
35 us citizens were removed from the rashid hotel in baghdad and 
taken to an undisclosed location most likely another hotel 
american diplomats in baghdad believe the americans may have 
been taken to the melia monsour a hotel where british citizens are 
also quartered but iraqi authorities prevented the embassy 
officials from entering the hotel to check state department 
spokesman richard boucher said in washington 
bush also plans to address the veterans of foreign war 
convention in baltimore monday and make a campaign trip to rhode 
island before returning to kennebunkport

the hms rose the worlds largest sailing 
wooden ship is trolling through the great lakes as it marks its 
longest journey since being restored in a connecticut harbor five 
years ago 
the 18thcentury british warship replica a 500ton wonder with 
masts reaching 150 feet into the air docked in chicago earlier 
this month and is touring several wisconsin ports along lake 
michigan before returning to connecticut in late september 
in all the ship will cover 5000 miles far fewer than its 
namesake traveled when it crossed the atlantic to attack rebel 
colonies during the revolutionary war 
it has been a very huge success at the ports that its been 
in said ron sonntag spokesman for the milwaukeebased festival 
events inc which arranged the tour its a huge spectacle 
people dont have any idea how big it is until they get next to 
it 
the vessel measures 179 feet long and 14 stories tall 
hundreds of midwesterners flocked on friday to watch the ship as 
it sailed into the harbor at racine wis the spectators were 
rewarded with a full 24cannon salute 
its very impressive its something i never thought id 
get the chance to see im bringing the children so they can see 
it i dont want them to miss a wonderful vision of the past said 
susan penn 40 of highland park ill who traveled north to 
racine to see the ship 
the hms rose left the bridgeport conn harbor june 20 
sailing up the atlantic coast to the st lawrence seaway its stops 
have included cleveland detroit and chicago it arrives in 
milwaukee its last stop aug 27 
the history of the rose is incredible we have the distinction 
of having the largest wooden vessel that is operational in the 
world said its owner kaye williams of bridgeport conn 
the replica was built in 1970 incorporating a cannon and the 
keel salvaged from the wreck of the original hms rose built in 
1757 as the british navys main warship the british had scuttled 
the ship in the savannah ga harbor at the end of the 
revolutionary war to avoid capture by the french 
but the replica was allowed to decay williams bought it for 
70000 in 1985 and spent 13 million to restore it as part of his 
development of a marina and restaurant 
festival events inc paid 250000 to bring the ship to 
milwaukee for the fourth annual maritime festival scheduled aug 
30 through sept 3 organizers expect 600 visitors to tour the ship 
every hour as part of the 200000 people expected at the event 
the hms rose and its crew of 28 are expected to return to 
bridgeport sept 20 
williams said he hopes to take the ship to puerto rico in 1992 
and then to the olympics in barcelona spain the same year 
such long trips are rare for wooden vessels in modern times but 
williams is confident theres no better duty for his ship 
she had to go to sea the quote that comes to mind is only 
men and ships rot at the dock williams said a vessel will 
come back in better shape than when she left

the vatican said saturday it would consider 
proposals for new scientific tests on the shroud of turin to 
determine whether the linen is jesus burial cloth 
the announcement by vatican spokesman joaquin navarro cast doubt 
on earlier test results indicating the shroud was only about 700 
years old 
cardinal anastasio ballestrero archbishop of turin and 
custodian of the shroud said in 1988 that carbon14 tests by us 
swiss and british laboratories showed the cloth dated to between 
1260 and 1390 
he said then that the tests were 95 percent accurate and he saw 
no reason for the church to dispute the results 
but on saturday navarro described the 1988 results as 
strange and said they conflicted with previous tests which 
indicated the cloth could date back 2000 years 
in the future as in the past the church will take into 
consideration all serious and competent operative proposals for 
tests on the shroud navarro said 
he said the church would attach no conditions to any new tests 
other than that they should not damage the shroud 
navarro said the shroud raises questions far beyond 
scientific and technical findings adding that it remains a mystery 
how the cloth came to bear the image of what appears to be a 
whipped and crucified man 
navarro announced that pope john paul ii had named monsignor 
giovanni saldarini as new custodian of the shroud saldarini 
succeeded ballestrero who retired last year as archbishop of 
turin 
navarro said ballestrero had acted with prudence and 
impartiality and had fostered a tradition of open rigorous and 
objective research 
for centuries the shroud has been revered by some as jesus 
actual burial cloth although the church has never claimed it was a 
holy relic others have described it as a clever forgery 
the shroud measures 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches 
wide it bears a faint image of the front and back of a man with a 
thorn mark on the head lacerations from flogging on the back and 
bruises on the shoulders suggestive of accounts of jesus 
crucifixion 
despite the 1988 findings ballestrero and other church 
officials disputed claims that the results proved the shroud was a 
fraud fake or forgery words indicating the cloth was meant to 
deceive people they said the shroud remains a venerated object and 
powerful symbol of faith 
for years church officials refused to let scientists study the 
cloth pope john paul ii in 1986 gave approval for testing 
the laboratories involved were the university of arizona oxford 
university and the swiss federal institute of technology at the 
university of zurich

thousands of iraqi troops withdrew 
saturday from occupied iranian territory and baghdad said those 
forces would be redeployed in the escalating confrontation with the 
united states 
iran sent home 1000 iraqi prisoners of war as a sign of its 
confidence that baghdads repatration of pows which began friday 
will continue 
the troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange followed an offer by 
iraqi president saddam hussein on wednesday to bring a formal end 
to the 19801988 iraniraq war a ceasefire halted the fighting 
two years ago 
iraqi troops flying white flags began pulling out of iranian 
border areas friday night iraqi forces had already pulled out of 
more than half the occupied areas in the southern shalamcheh and 
kushk regions irans islamic republic news agency said saturday 
saddam has said the pullout will take five days 
iran says iraq occupies more than 773 square miles of its 
territories but the united nations says the size of the occupied 
area is half of that 
the iraqi army daily newspaper alqaddasiyah declared in an 
editorial saturday that the 30 divisions which have been facing 
iran would now be used to bolster iraqi formations in the south 
that was the first official iraqi word that baghdad will 
redeploy forces freed from the iranian border in kuwait occupied 
by iraq on aug 2 
the forces which are leaving irans borders and the high 
readiness of our air force will be an additional might to what we 
had already prepared against the aggressive forces the daily 
said 
it was not known how many of the 30 iraqi divisions more than 
200000 troops would be moved to kuwait the iraqis have about 10 
divisions in to the occupied emirate and have more than 120000 
troops massed on the border with saudi arabia 
iranian newspapers ran huge headlines saturday welcoming the 
prisoners some of whom were captured soon after the outbreak of 
war in september 1980 
the farsilanguge jomhuri eslami called their return a major 
victory for iran 
the site of the prisoner exchanges qasreshirin a sleepy 
dusty town inside the iranian border was decked with flowers 
flags and colored ribbons 
at tehrans mehrabad airport a 10yearold girl named nahid 
waited anxiously for the arrival of her father she knew him only 
from a framed photograph on the mantel and from her mothers 
stories 
in a message to the international committee of the red cross 
iranian red crescent head vaheed dastjerdi urged that the prisoner 
repatriation be boosted to 5000 a day with regard to the 
sensitive and dangerous conditions in the persian gulf 
the red crescent said it could handle that many but the 
international committee of the red cross has said that for now it 
can only handle daily 1000 mandatory interviews to make sure the 
prisoners want to go home it said it hoped to increase that number 
the red cross has registered about 19000 iranian pows in iraq 
and about 50000 iraqis in iran but the united nations estimates 
that both sides actually hold more than 100000

magellan sent information to earth today 
to help engineers learn why they temporarily lost contact with the 
spacecraft after its first pictures displayed quake faults 
volcanic cinder cones and plains made of lava flows on venus 
after steady contact with the spacecraft was reestablished 
friday night engineers commanded the spacecraft to transmit all of 
the information in its computer memories back to earth this will 
continue throughout the weekend said mary beth murrill 
spokeswoman for nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
she said it might take days to figure out why magellan lost 
contact with earth on thursday night after it sent back its first 
test pictures of venus images that had scientists marveling 
the radar works far better than we ever dreamed it would 
said steve saunders magellans chief scientist the kind of 
faulting we see would certainly mean there are venusquakes 
the pictures will be released tuesday the national aeronautics 
and space administration said in a statement issued friday night 
before the problem developed magellan was scheduled to start 
its formal mapping mission aug 29 using its radar to peer through 
venus thick clouds murrill said a delay is likely but engineers 
havent yet announced their plans 
engineers today continued the process of returning magellan to 
normal operation it lost touch with earth for almost 15 hours 
starting thursday night then continued to go in and out of radio 
contact over the next eight hours 
a computer command sent to magellan on friday night restored 
steady radio contact at 711 pm pdt 
we jumped up and clapped said tommy thompson magellan 
science operations manager it was just like the home team scoring 
a touchdown 
thompson said engineers expected to remain in touch with 
magellan except when it swings behind venus when it normally is 
unable to send or receive signals from earth as of today the two 
planets were 147 million miles apart 
engineers will spend the coming days diagnosing the cause of the 
communications breakdown and deciding how to prevent it from 
happening again thompson added 
magellan was deployed may 4 1989 from the shuttle atlantis on 
its 744 million mission to make the best maps and pictures yet of 
venus the spaceship went into orbit around venus on aug 10 after 
a looping 948millionmile voyage 
less detailed radar pictures of venus from other us and soviet 
spacecraft and from a radio telescope at arecibo puerto rico 
revealed signs of faults on venus and also found tens of thousands 
of volcanoes although scientists still dont know if any are 
active 
magellans first pictures showed in much better detail regions 
that intensely faulted and also clear indications a lot of 
plains are old lava flows fractured by younger faults saunders 
said 
what were seeing is some of the lava flows that came out of 
large volcanoes but we havent seen any large volcanoes yet he 
added 
saunders said volcanic cinder cones in the pictures have craters 
on top and the cones range from threefifths of a mile to 1 mile 
wide their height hasnt yet been calculated 
magellan must pass over the same area twice to detect landscape 
changes that would indicate volcanoes are erupting it takes 243 
earth days for venus to spin once beneath the nearly polarorbiting 
magellan so it will be at least eight months until magellan will 
be able to look for signs of active volcanoes 
when magellan first lost contact with earth on thursday night 
its sophisticated computer programs automatically put it into a 
protective state of semihibernation called a safing mode 
turning its solar panels to the sun to make sure it drew adequate 
power laboratory spokesman jim doyle said 
magellan automatically entered an even deeper hibernation friday 
morning shutting down crucial systems to protect them but also 
making the spacecraft start rotating as it beamed radio signals 
into space 
that assured some of the signals would reach earth but also 
meant radio contact was intermittent throughout the day the 
command sent friday night stopped the rotation and kept magellans 
secondary antenna pointed toward earth to maintain contact 
communication through the secondary antenna is slower than 
through magellans main antenna but the secondary antenna 
broadcasts a much broader coneshaped radio beam allowing contact 
to be maintained more easily nasa said controllers will switch 
back to the main antenna sometime next week 
magellans radio signals are tracked by 230footwide dish 
antennas at goldstone calif and in australia and spain

the car when the bedouin guide told me we were in saudi arabia 
my companions whooped and hugged each other 
but most of us were sad for kuwait its people and the friends 
we left behind 
my joy could not erase the memories of recent days starting 
with that awful thursday morning of aug 2 when the bomb blasts 
shook me out of bed

tanks were rumbling brazenly into kuwait city 
i told my canadian flatmate kathy mcgregor that the iraqis 
were there and ran to the roof 
there was gunfire the t72s were rolling through the streets 
the iraqi soldiers stopped all motorists and pedestrians at 
gunpoint 
they yanked the mobile phones out of cars and threw them away 
they shot at motorists who didnt stop 
i called the ap with the news then rushed back to the roof 
iraqi army vehicles were heading to the oil area of alahmadi 
helicopter gunships swooped low over the city there was no sign of 
kuwaiti troops 
the iraqis were shooting indiscriminately it was frightening 
at midafternoon the iraqis shelled the sief palace the 
interior ministry and the parliament building people were scared 
and confused no one knew what to do 
the shelling shifted later to the residence of the emir sheik 
jaber alahmed alsabah and the palace of the crown prince sheik 
saad abdullah alsabah

we knew that the emirs cousin sheik fahd alahmed alsabah 
was killed by an iraqi tank shell outside the royal palace which 
he tried to defend with a rifle 
we were really scared we left our beloved house and took refuge 
at an embassy i cant say which one for fear the iraqis might harm 
the people who are still there 
aug 7 we moved to the sas hotel iraqi soldiers came and 
demanded a list of everyone in the hotel and their nationalities 
the list was taken to an iraqi major at the royal club suite 
we decided the hotel was no longer safe we left i spoke arabic 
to the iraqis and they thought i was arab 
we hid our passports in our shoes and sought refuge at another 
place which i wont name we stayed underground for eight very 
long very boring days 
aug 8 we started practicing selfdefense karate how to 
stab with a knife if attacked how to kick and disable an 
adversary survival was the keyword 
aug 9 we were glued to the radio practically cut off from 
the world we wanted to know what was going on in kuwait 
we knew the americans were out to save kuwait and defend saudi 
arabia that was good to know 
we knew that the us embassy was telling americans to pack and 
be ready to leave was there any chance of evacuating safely no 
one seemed to know 
aug 10 iraqi president saddam hussein pledged to wage a 
jihad or holy war against america oh saddam give us a break

enough military muscle to confront iraq and alluded to chemical 
weapons as its ultimate means to crush america

aug 15 i was seriously thinking of escaping but we needed a 
foolproof plan a fourwheel drive vehicle water and food plus a 
guide to get us across the desert 
aug 16 the iraqis called us nationals to gather at the 
international hotel the british at the regency 
there was no way we were going to just give ourselves up to be 
transported to baghdad 
a british woman married to a kuwaiti called and offered to 
help with an escape 
we got a bedouin guide we contacted a number of friends two 
americans a briton a canadian and four indians they agreed to 
join us pretty soon we had more than 60 people ready to go 
aug 17 lebanese friends filled our jeep with gasoline from 
their cars kuwaiti friends provided black chador robes and veils 
for disguise almost everyone put on arab robes 
all the cars gathered at 10 am and the great escape was on we 
gave our dog a sleeping pill to keep her quiet and took the asphalt 
highway past iraqi troops 
we were scared but the guide reassured us we were stopped at 
one checkpoint and the soldiers told us to go back 
we drove into the desert but the iraqis were there too 
they stopped us demanded our identity cards and told us to go 
back 
we turned around but tried another desert track we played 
hideandseek with the iraqis dodging around troop camps without 
being spotted 
we saw many cars abandoned by people who had tried to get away 
we never knew what happened to them 
tanks were everywhere wed get through one sector then regroup 
for the next dash 
we passed scores of armored vehicles some abandoned our guide 
said some iraqi tank crews had deserted to the saudis by joining 
refugee convoys 
we thought our luck had run out when we ran right into a tank 
formation but we slipped through 
we discovered one of the cars was missing the guide found it 
stuck in the sand and iraqi soldiers helping the kuwaiti 
occupants pull it out 
the guide said two of the iraqis were generals who apologized to 
the kuwaitis for the invasion 
we headed off again after several hours we hit a solid road 
our guide turned to me beaming and said the most wonderful words 
ive ever heard no more dangers youre now in saudi arabia

it was a town looking for appeal and no 
monkey business 
civic boosters on thursday bought the makings for 50 banana 
plants in a campaign to make this community of 1100 the banana 
city in the cornbelt of america 
this is the beginning of the big banana groves in the central 
region of the united states said businessman gene brooks sr 
the banana belt has come to the republican valley 
the banana belt idea took root about a year ago when brooks 
began running radio ads for his car dealership attempting to draw 
attention by advising listeners to come to banana city 
one person called and asked if he was actually going to grow 
bananas 
i said we certainly are brooks said even though the 
idea had not occurred to me yet 
brooks researched bananas and ordered the banana corms or 
starts from mexico the corms planted in half whiskey barrels 
will grow to 8 feet and could produce edible bananas within a 
couple of years 
the barrels lined along city sidewalks will be brought indoors 
during the winter 
businessman lowell harms said it is a positive way to promote 
the community the next thing we have to do is find the 
monkeys he said

doctors treating lee atwater have resumed 
radiation therapy to treat the republican national committee 
chairman for brain tumor progression a spokeswoman said 
saturday 
however the spokeswoman leslie goodman did not respond 
directly when asked about reports that physicians treating the 
39yearold south carolinian had discovered a second brain tumor 
she replied only that physicians were not specific on that 
saturday editions of two south carolina newspapers quoted 
unidentified sources as saying doctors had discovered a new growth 
but goodman said doctors stated only that there has been tumor 
progression and thats about as much as we know and about as far as 
they intend to go in their description 
she described atwaters condition as unchanged from friday 
hes alert seeing visitors and did undergo radiation 
treatment yesterday she added 
goodman said the visitors had included family friends and some 
bush administration officials 
a statement issued thursday by the republican national committee 
had said a biopsy performed on atwater indicated tumor 
progression requiring additional treatment the statement said 
also that atwater began receiving radiation treatment wednesday 
he was diagnosed march 6 as having a nonmalignant tumor on the 
right side of his brain 
the discovery of the second tumor was reported by the state 
newspaper in columbia sc which cited close friends of atwater 
and the news amp courier of charleston which quoted a source close 
to the situation 
responding to those reports goodman said atwaters doctors 
arent sure whether its a new tumor or part of the old tumor 
atwater underwent brain tumor surgery on april 3 and has been in 
and out of the hospital repeatedly for treatment of ailments 
ranging from a blood clot in his leg to a nagging fever 
until this week however doctors believed the tumor was 
virtually gone 
a friend described atwater who managed president bushs 1988 
campaign as very very weak 
the controversial atwater was president bushs 1988 campaign 
manager 
he has described himself as a nuts and bolts politician but he 
enraged democrats with his hardball brand of politics 
democrats were especially incensed when atwater was credited 
with effectively injecting black massachusetts prisoner willie 
horton accused of raping a white woman while on furlough into the 
1988 presidential campaign against democrat michael dukakis 
because of the horton matter atwaters later efforts to woo 
black voters into the republican fold were hampered 
born in atlanta atwater was 9 years old when his parents moved 
to columbia 
in high school he gained a passion for music and even after he 
attained national prominence in politics atwater often performed 
as a rhythm and blues guitarist

the white house denounced iraqs use 
of innocent civilians as pawns in the persian gulf crisis 
saturday as new threats to the safety of americans posed what one 
analyst called a tremendous painful dilemma for president bush 
once again the specter of hostages is forcing an american 
president to confront delicate issues of life and death in the 
middle east 
the 3000 americans trapped in kuwait and iraq may be an 
achilles heel in bushs campaign to force iraqi president saddam 
hussein to withdraw his invading army from kuwait and return exiled 
leaders to power 
hes bush in a classic bind said colorado college 
political scientist tom cronin hes now invested militarily so 
much in it that he would look like a weak leader if he backed down 
or compromised because of the hostages 
bush was silent saturday but was described by aides as deeply 
troubled that americans and foreigners were being moved against 
their will in iraq presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said it 
was totally unacceptable that baghdad said it will hold captive 
americans as a shield as long as their was any threat to iraq 
iraq also warned that all foreigners will suffer if shortages of 
food and medicine result from sanctions and the usled embargo 
the white house said bush was deeply concerned by that news 
the use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what iraq 
sees to be its selfinterest is contrary to international law and 
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct fitzwater 
said in a statement 
we urge that iraq immediately reconsider its refusal to allow 
any foreign national desiring to leave to do so without delay or 
condition fitzwater said 
brookings institution analyst judith kipper said iraqs use of 
the foreigners was blackmail she said saddam had created a 
tremendous painful dilemma for bush but that the united states 
still might have to use force even if innocent americans were 
killed 
its not because were so coldhearted and mean but because 
its such a major crisis she said if we wait its not going 
to get better only worse 
while confronting iraq with a massive buildup of american combat 
forces bush had hoped that saddam would not use us citizens as 
an insurance policy against any us strike or to force a rollback 
of sanctions 
trying to keep the stakes low bush has refused to call the 
americans hostages he referred to them last friday as 
inconvenienced people who want to get out 
hostage situations in the past have embroiled presidents carter 
and reagan bush inherited an ongoing sixyear hostage situation 
in lebanon 
saddam clearly recognizes that captive americans can be used as 
important bargaining chips expendable if necessary his past 
practices indicate he clearly plays for keeps 
saddam has used chemical weapons against his own citizens and 
has repeatedly demonstrated a ruthless disregard for the lives of 
innocent civilians there are fears that americans and other 
foreigners might be positioned around military and industrial 
centers in iraq to deter attack from the united states and its 
allies 
fitzwater in his statement said he hoped iraq would take 
note of fridays statement by the un security council 
expressing concern and anxiety over the plight of foreign nations 
in iraq and kuwait 
the united states intends to consult with other governments 
with citizens being held in iraq and kuwait to determine what 
additional measures ought to be taken fitzwater said 
the white house announced that bush would break away from his 
vacation sunday earlier than anticipated to return to washington to 
meet over dinner with his national security advisers 
the president was piloting his high speed boat fidelity 
when iraq declared that the economic embargo against it was an act 
of war and warned that westerners would suffer if iraqis did 
bush was notified of the developments in a shiptoshore call 
from robert gates his deputy national security adviser

the warning that foreigners would starve came in a statement 
from the ministry of labor and social affairs also carried by ina 
it singled out the united states for blame in blocking food 
supplies and accused washington of going beyond the mandatory un 
sanctions in denying iraq food and medicine 
the united nations imposed the embargo aug 6 four days after 
iraq invaded and occupied kuwait 
the united states proceeded with applying an economic seige by 
military force against iraq and such an act by international 
law is known as an act of war said ina 
it emphasized that the blockade would deny children their milk 
medication and other necessities 
because the children of the world are beloved of god and of 
saddam hussein and in compliance with our humanitarian 
principleswe have decided to place the children of foreign 
families which iraq has decided to host in equality with the 
children of iraq andwhat affects the children of iraq will 
equally effect them said the statement 
it said adult westerners will also be affected 
due to the circumstances of the boycott and economic siege 
which have been imposed by the united states by military means food 
will not be available for all adults in the amounts we would 
wish the statement said 
the ministry noted that europeans especially britons will 
understand the measures due to their previous experiences 
it said the food supplies in iraq would be distributed to the 
military and in iraqs extensive military industries on a priority 
basis because they are the shield of the nation 
the solution to the problem was to end the blockade said the 
statement 
on friday iraqs parliament speaker said iraq would host 
all foreigners from nations taking what he called an aggressive 
stance against iraq 
it said they would be released only when the threat of war was 
lifted 
there are two million foreigners in iraq and kuwait which iraq 
annexed after its aug 2 invasion the foreigners include 20000 
westerners including about 4500 britons and 3000 americans the 
largest groups 
the iraqi government later clarified the statement to say that 
the restrictions on leaving the country did not apply to egyptians 
also saturday the iraqi army daily alqaddasiyah said 
weapons of mass destruction and strategic deterence possessed by 
iraq will be lying in wait to turn those who contemplate committing 
aggression into scattered pieces

will disneylands abe lincoln be deposed 
by kermit the frog and the muppet gang 
great moments with mr lincoln which features a robot 
replica of the 16th us president will close at least temporarily 
aug 26 disneyland spokesman bob roth said friday 
roth would not comment on employee reports that a 3d movie 
featuring the late jim hensons muppet characters will replace 
lincoln but he did say no reopening date for the 25yearold 
lincoln attraction had been set 
its a refurbishing of that whole facility said roth 
well be announcing our plans 
the lincoln attraction is housed in the disneyland opera house 
which also holds exhibits on the park and its founder walt disney 
disney himself developed the audioanimatronic lincoln 
which premiered at the 1964 new york worlds fair and moved to 
disneyland in 1965 lincoln stands up from a chair gestures and 
recites excerpts from his speeches 
disney was extremely proud of creating that figure roth 
said the lincoln attraction underwent a 200000 renovation about 
five years ago 
according to park employees who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the muppet movie is replacing lincoln as part of disneylands 
effort to give a higher profile to hensons characters 
disney officials announced earlier this year that a muppet stage 
show and parade were planned for the park in 1991 while a 3d 
muppetvision movie and theater was set for 1993 
disney last year purchased rights to use the muppet characters 
in its theme parks movies teleivison shops and retail products 
asked about the chance the muppet image could swamp the older 
disney characters such as mickey mouse roth noted that when 
changes have been made in the past such as teaming with filmmaker 
george lucas to create star tours and captain eo there 
was criticism 
every time you do something like that there will be people who 
are unhappy saying thats not how walt disney would have done 
it he said

a metal box found in the south 
pacific initially dismissed as junk may be a promising clue to 
the disappearance of pilot amelia earhart say members of an 
organization trying to unravel the mystery 
ms earhart and navigator fred noonan vanished without a trace 
53 years ago while attempting to make an aroundtheworld flight 
tom willi and tom gannon both retired military fliers living in 
this florida panhandle city used 1930s navigation techniques to 
plot earharts likely course 
they persuaded the international group for historic aircraft 
recovery based in wilmington del to mount a 250000 expedition 
last year to the pacific atoll nikumaroro and nearby mckean island 
tighars 28member team returned with several items but the 
most intriguing is the aluminum box now identified as a 
navigators bookcase the box about one foot by one foot by 10 
inches was buried in sand on the atoll and discovered with someone 
using a metal detector 
gannon said friday that he believes the bookcase came from ms 
earharts plane 
its more than a promising lead its a convincer he told 
the northwest florida daily news 
but tighars president patricia thrasher was more cautious 
we arent ready to say this is it tada she said we 
cant do that until we see a photograph of it in the earhart 
airplane or find somebody who says yeah i installed one for 
noonan but we are very excited about it 
researchers have determined the bookcase was manufactured by 
consolidated aircraft corp of san diego for pby catalina flying 
boats used to resupply a coast guard navigation and communications 
base on nowuninhabited nikumaroro during world war ii 
however tighar reported in its august newsletter that wartime 
pbys carried a latermodel bookcase and that the one found by the 
earhart expedition had mounting holes and fixtures that are all 
wrong for installation in a pby 
the researchers have speculated that noonan could have bought or 
borrowed a bookcase from the navy and modified it for use in ms 
earharts twoengine lockheed electra 
early versions of the bookcase were available in 1936 and 1937 
thrasher said ms earhart and noonan vanished in july 1937 
the organization has been unable to find any photographs or 
official sketches of the interior of the missing electra 
the focus for photographers was always earhart and that meant 
the cockpit not the back of the aircraft where the navigators 
bookcase wouldve been she said 
thrasher said the group plans to return to nikumaroro in 
september 1991 to look for the missing plane with remote underwater 
search equipment 
if its where we think the airplane is going to be down about 
2000 feet thrasher said

the creator of a suicide device who gained 
national attention when he used it to help an alzheimers disease 
patient end her own life said saturday that he may defy a court ban 
and help others die 
if a person is beyond hope what do i care about any court 
injunction dr jack kevorkian said in a telephone interview from 
his royal oak apartment about 15 miles north of detroit if a 
patient is really needing it i may have to act if nothing else 
out of human compassion 
his statement saturday appears to reverse what he has maintained 
since the injunction june 8 when he said im out of business 
he said hes talked with two michigan women who want to die 
one he described only as crippled the other has an extreme 
case of emphysema 
kevorkian said he has checked with their doctors on the 
diagnoses and he has met with the family of one of the women 
he had met with the family of janet adkins before deciding to 
use his device in his van at a county park on june 4 the machine 
and his 1968 volkswagen van were confiscated after adkins 54 of 
portland ore pressed a button that released lethal chemicals 
into her system 
kevorkian said it would take a few days to build another device 
if he decided to use it 
i wouldnt do it just to get arrested it would be to help a 
patient kevorkian said 
kevorkian was in oakland county circuit court on friday to 
respond to a temporary injunction issued after adkins death 
judge alice gilbert had ordered him to stop using the device and 
also enjoined the 62yearold retired pathologist from helping 
people use any other means to kill themselves 
kevorkian didnt answer the injunction and assistant county 
prosecutor michael modelski said default papers were filed friday 
instead of ruling on a permanent injunction gilbert gave kevorkian 
21 days to answer the default ruling 
modelski said saturday that kevorkian could be in contempt of 
court if he uses the machine 
he basically is saying that hes above anybodys rules and 
thats the problem modelski said it could trigger a possible 
second criminal investigation if he uses it again 
he said that after the current investigation if no criminal 
charges are filed were going to have people flying in from all 
over to use this machine 
michigan has no specific law against suicide or assisting in it 
the case is under investigation by the county prosecutor state 
police and state medical association 
gilbert suggested to kevorkian that he get a lawyer but 
kevorkian said he has no intentions of doing that because he said 
he hasnt broken any laws 
theyre just trying everything to stop me kevorkian said 
i dare them to bring charges do something throw me in jail if 
you can

for merchants in the 
gateway communities of yosemite national park business has been no 
business at all since fires closed the popular park to tourists 
three major fires and dozens of smaller ones in the 725000acre 
park since aug 3 scarred more than 22000 acres felled timbers 
and destroyed 66 buildings more than a week ago the park was 
closed to visitors and most of the park is due to stay closed 
until monday 
cool weather washed over much of firescarred california by the 
weekend as firefighters further tamed the last in a deadly siege of 
1300 blazes but a national weather service expert milo 
radulovich said thunderstorms which ignited nearly all the fires 
by spawning more than 37000 lightning strikes in less than two 
weeks are likely to recur after the cooling spell ends monday 
for those who make their living in communities near yosemite 
closing the park during the height of the summer tourist season has 
taken a financial toll and its aftermath will probably be felt 
through the leaner winter months 
hotels and motels were hit hard 
we cant recoup said joan gloor owner of the 37room 
mariposa lodge off highway 140 a major southern gateway to

kimberly mays an 11yearold at the 
center of a twoyear babyswap controversy has finally met the 
couple who proved she was switched with another baby in a maternity 
ward according to a report published saturday 
but a relative says the girl is still confused by the legal 
tugofwar and all the attention from a family she never knew 
meanwhile the man who raised the girl has joined the girls 
natural parents in a lawsuit against the hospital where the switch 
apparently occurred 
the longawaited meeting between the sarasota girl and her 
biological parents ernest and regina twigg took place quietly 
this spring at a miniature golf course in sarasota the st 
petersburg times reported saturday 
the couple and robert mays who raised kimberly as his only 
daughter agreed to keep the visit secret to avoid the crush of 
reporters and photographers who have followed the highprofile case 
through the courts 
during an initial rendezvous and two subsequent meetings 
kimberly an only child in the mays family also was introduced to 
her seven brothers and sisters in the twigg family 
apparently with the kids it went very good but when you ask 
about the parents she just puts her hands up in the air and shakes 
them said velma coker one of kimberlys grandmothers 
shes still mixedup mrs coker told the newspaper 
kimberly born at a tiny rural hospital in central florida went 
home with the wrong parents mays and his wife barbara who died 
of cancer in 1981 
ms mays and ms twigg delivered blondhaired girls within a 
couple days of each other in late 1978 at hardee memorial hospital 
in wauchula the mays baby and the twigg baby were the only two 
white girls born around the same time at the hospital both mothers 
went home on dec 5 1978 
it wasnt until genetic tests a decade later that the families 
learned they had raised each others daughter 
the girl the twiggs named arlena and raised as their own died of 
a heart defect two years ago never knowing that doubts about her 
parentage had been raised shortly before she died 
the twiggs set out to find their natural daughter the path led 
to sarasota mays and the twiggs feuded in court over genetic 
testing and custody rights mays won a promise from the twiggs that 
they wouldnt seek custody no matter what the tests showed 
genetic testing confirmed last fall that kimberly was born to 
the twiggs who now live in sebring 
attempts to reach mays and the twiggs for comment were 
unsuccessful saturday each family has an unlisted number

iraqi troops have made forays 
believed to be for reconnaissance along the saudiiraqi border a 
top saudi official said saturday 
in an intelligence assessment of the persian gulf crisis the 
official said the iraqis are thought to have 170000 men and 1000 
tanks in kuwait 
because of the flat desert terrain tanks are easily moved 
around the region he said 
at the moment all the indications are that they are digging 
in the official said of the iraqi troops he spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the iraqis in kuwait are remaining at least 25 miles from the 
saudi border and have set up a command center at alwafrah in 
southern kuwait 
meanwhile iraqi forces have been spotted on the saudiiraqi 
border near kuwait the official said 
the troops have been few and their forays have been brief the 
official said he speculated they are reconnaissance missions along 
the 520mile saudiiraqi border 
the only way to dislodge iraqi troops from kuwait at this point 
would be to deal significant blows both economic and military 
to saddam hussain the official said 
he said it was impossible to predict how long saddam could keep 
his country fed during the international boycott because there is 
no estimate of how much food iraq has stockpiled 
iraq imports more than 70 percent of its food and the saudi 
official said he knows they had orders for foodstuffs which have 
not reached iraq 
one shortage that saddam does not face is military hardware the 
official said they are well stocked and they have spare parts 
and they have manufacturing capabilities he said 
at the same time the official said the saudis will work to 
encourage the local resistance to saddam in kuwait and iraq 
in kuwait there are reports of people buying tanks from iraqi 
troops to blow them up the official claimed he said kuwaitis are 
broadcasting antisaddam radio programs into iraq 
the official said the saudis are convinced that if saddam is 
deposed his government will crumble 
but saddams moves are hard to predict because the iraqi 
president discusses his plans with only a small coterie of advisers

the white house denounced iraqs use 
of innocent civilians as pawns in the persian gulf crisis 
saturday as new threats to the safety of americans posed what one 
analyst called a tremendous painful dilemma for president bush 
once again the specter of hostages is forcing an american 
president to confront delicate issues of life and death in the 
middle east 
the 3000 americans trapped in kuwait and iraq may be an 
achilles heel in bushs campaign to force iraqi president saddam 
hussein to withdraw his invading army from kuwait and return exiled 
leaders to power 
hes bush in a classic bind said colorado college 
political scientist tom cronin hes now invested militarily so 
much in it that he would look like a weak leader if he backed down 
or compromised because of the hostages 
bush was silent saturday but was described by aides as deeply 
troubled that americans and foreigners were being moved against 
their will in iraq presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said it 
was totally unacceptable that baghdad said it will hold captive 
americans as a shield as long as their was any threat to iraq 
iraq also warned that all foreigners will suffer if shortages of 
food and medicine result from sanctions and the usled embargo 
the white house said bush was deeply concerned by that news 
the use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what iraq 
sees to be its selfinterest is contrary to international law and 
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct fitzwater 
said in a statement 
we urge that iraq immediately reconsider its refusal to allow 
any foreign national desiring to leave to do so without delay or 
condition fitzwater said 
brookings institution analyst judith kipper said iraqs use of 
the foreigners was blackmail she said saddam had created a 
tremendous painful dilemma for bush but that the united states 
still might have to use force even if innocent americans were 
killed 
its not because were so coldhearted and mean but because 
its such a major crisis she said if we wait its not going 
to get better only worse 
while confronting iraq with a massive buildup of american combat 
forces bush had hoped that saddam would not use us citizens as 
an insurance policy against any us strike or to force a rollback 
of sanctions 
trying to keep the stakes low bush has refused to call the 
americans hostages he referred to them last friday as 
inconvenienced people who want to get out 
hostage situations in the past have embroiled presidents carter 
and reagan bush inherited an ongoing sixyear hostage situation 
in lebanon 
saddam clearly recognizes that captive americans can be used as 
important bargaining chips expendable if necessary his past 
practices indicate he clearly plays for keeps 
saddam has used chemical weapons against his own citizens and 
has repeatedly demonstrated a ruthless disregard for the lives of 
innocent civilians there are fears that americans and other 
foreigners might be positioned around military and industrial 
centers in iraq to deter attack from the united states and its 
allies 
fitzwater in his statement said he hoped iraq would take 
note of fridays statement by the un security council 
expressing concern and anxiety over the plight of foreign nations 
in iraq and kuwait 
the united states intends to consult with other governments 
with citizens being held in iraq and kuwait to determine what 
additional measures ought to be taken fitzwater said 
the white house announced that bush would break away from his 
vacation sunday earlier than anticipated to return to washington to 
meet over dinner with his national security advisers

remember this is not a race where we just try to win and push 
everyone aside he warned the kids as they lined up

watching the kids race 
its the team work of the schools and parents that can save 
our children today schwarzenegger told parents urging them to 
avoid being couch potatoes and to join their kids instead in

east germanys nowdisbanded secret police 
may have been behind the deaths of several west german businessmen 
who dealt with east german firms a west berlin newspaper said 
saturday 
the berliner morgenpost said some cases involved west germans 
who managed firms that were fronts for east german operations 
the paper quoted karlheinz schlurmann a former eastwest 
commerce expert as saying links existed between the unexplained 
deaths of several west german businessmen who had dealings with the 
former communist government 
the paper cited the case of hamburg businessman uwe harms who 
was found shot to death in his apartment on april 26 1987 
it quoted schlurmann as saying harms was involved in shipping 
weapons from east germany to third world countries balked at the 
business and was killed because he knew too much 
the newspaper also cited the september 1981 death of karlheinz 
noetzel who it said was chief of an east german cover firm in 
essen west germany 
it said noetzel was found dead in a leipzig hotel bathroom 
apparently having suffocated it quoted schlurmann as saying a 
possible motive for his death may have been corruption 
it said noetzels successor jf bruns died on aug 20 1982 
in the east berlin hotel metropol after he was suspected of being 
an agent for the west 
it also cited the death in a car accident of trade expert horst 
busse in march 1972 
the newspaper report follows recent allegations that the secret 
police may have tracked down and killed prominent east german 
refugees who fled to the west and that they also harbored 
notorious leftwing terrorists wanted in western nations 
sensational disclosures have been coming out ever since east 
germany threw off its hardline communist rulers and elected a 
democratic government

gov l douglas wilders announcement that 
he would impose broad spending cuts without raising taxes is seen 
as further evidence he plans to run for national office possibly 
as early as 1992 
anybody who thinks the governor is not looking at 1992 in 
spite of what hes said is extraordinarily naive said sen 
dudley j emick jr a fellow democrat 
wilder who has received widespread publicity since he became 
the nations first elected black governor in january has said he 
has no plans to seek national office before his term ends in 1994 
but his costcutting plans are seen as a way to contrast his 
record with that of president bush who is considering a tax 
increase to balance the federal budget 
wilder thinks if he can contrast himself with both george bush 
and with socalled taxandspend democrats hes well positioned 
for a national race said robert holsworth a virginia 
commonwealth university political analyst 
hes positioned himself for the kind of race he would have to 
run whether its in 92 or 96 that of a fiscal conservative 
said larry sabato a university of virginia political scientist 
in a statewide televised address thursday night wilder said he 
would freeze state employee salaries slash state agency spending 
eliminate some minor agencies and cut aid to schools to make up a 
projected 14 billion budget shortfall he blamed an economic 
slump for the expected drop in tax revenues to fund the states 26 
billion twoyear budget 
the governor said he would propose no new taxes and would 
maintain services for the poor and medically needy 
that plays well among the pragmatists of the democratic 
party sabato said 
holsworth said the speech was wilders latest success in 
portraying himself as a fiscal conservative while still holding on 
to his core black and liberal constituency 
but he said wilder may have jeopardized his relationship with 
state legislators some of whom were angry about not being 
consulted on the cuts 
holsworth also said wilder could be hurt in the long run by 
cutting education funding which is particularly needed in poor 
rural schools that he has pledged to improve 
holsworth likened wilder to democrat jimmy carter who launched 
himself to the presidency by emphasizing his budget cutting and 
social compassion during one term as governor of georgia 
sabato said he saw similarities to republican ronald reagan who 
blamed carter for the fiscal problems that he inherited in the 
early 1980s 
sabato said wilder has taken the same approach by blaming his 
democratic predecessor gerald l baliles for leaving behind 
fiscal problems wilder took his latest dig at the former governor 
by saying he would abolish the department of world trade that 
baliles created 
despite his denial of national ambitions in 1992 wilder may 
have betrayed himself when he announced the revenue shortfall at a 
news conference aug 1 
the governor said he wanted to reveal the budget problems to 
the american people before quickly correcting himself

serbian leader milan babic that contacts were under way with 
croatian president franjo tudjman and the head of croatian police 
to defuse the dispute 
babic appealed over local radio to serbs manning roadblocks to 
let traffic pass 
on friday yugoslav air force fighters intercepted a flight of 
police helicopters before they could reach this region near the 
adriatic coast 
the increasingly bitter disagreements between yugoslavias two 
largest ethnic groups threatens to tear the fragile federation 
apart 
if the police come try to break through in their armored cars 
we will fry them like chickens in a pan said a serbian man armed 
with a doublebarrel shotgun standing guard at a roadblock nine 
miles north of knin he refused to identify himself 
other armed serbs felled trees and dumped rocks on the main 
highway south of the croatian capital zagreb to seal off the 
area in a village near knin some serbs were seen armed with light 
machine guns 
the roadblocks sealed off resorts on the adriatic coast and 
left carloads of german and italian tourists stuck facing armed 
village men 
serbs the largest yugoslav ethnic group make up 11 percent of 
croatias 5 million people serbs charge tudjmans new 
reformminded government with fostering nationalism 
tudjmans administration advocates turning the country into a 
loose federation of six nearly independent states 
serbias hardline communist president slobodan milosevic and 
the communistdominated armed forces oppose this and favor greater 
centralization and federal control 
official croatian radio said earlier that tensions started to 
ebb saturday 
it accused the serbian minority of trying to secede and join the 
serbian republic croatian officials fear that would foster 
domination of yugoslavia by the serbia 
in its statement issued later the croatian presidency asked the 
federal government to take measures to prevent extreme 
nationalists from serbia from coming to croatia with 
reinforcements it did not elaborate 
croatian radio said use of national air force jets to stop the 
police helicopters amounted to an effort to overthrow the states 
new government and to put a stop to democratic processes in 
yugoslavia 
the croatian presidency called on the federal presidency to 
determine the responsibility of senior army commanders in the 
incident 
the state news agency tanjug said the yugoslav army 
chiefofstaff informed croatian premier stipe mesic the army would 
not intervene as long as there are no casualties 
but the statement also said the armys tasks included preventing 
fratricidal war and the army would perform this task 
unconditionally according to the constitution and the law

the soviet union plans to start withdrawing 
its troops from east germany ahead of schedule a west german 
newspaper reported saturday 
the hamburgbased newspaper bild am sonntag said in an article 
released to other news media that the withdrawal of some of the 
estimated 370000 soviet troops stationed in east germany could 
begin as early as next week 
the newspaper said the withdrawal of moscows largest military 
force outside the soviet union could be completed by the end of 
next year 
bild am sonntag did not identify its sources and the duty 
officer at the soviet embassy in east berlin had no comment 
a west german foreign ministry spokesman in bonn denied that the 
pullout would be completed by the end of 1991 
the official juergen chrobog said the timetable would follow 
the agreement reached last month by west german chancellor helmut 
kohl and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev they agreed that 
the withdrawal would be spread out over three to four years 
however bild quoted horst teltschik a top aide to kohl as 
saying that he would not exclude that the withdrawal would take 
place at a faster tempo than agreed upon earlier 
bild said that according to nato reports about 10000 trains 
with 50 cars each are needed to take all the troops home 
east germans have already begun to express impatience with the 
soviet troops continued presence graffiti saying russen raus 
russians out is not uncommon in towns where soviet soldiers are 
stationed 
soviet troops have already started pulling out of czechoslovakia 
and hungary as the once formidable warsaw pact disintegrates in the 
face of democratic changes in eastern europe 
moscow will be losing its most important warsaw pact ally once 
east germany unites with west germany a member of the north 
atlantic treaty organization that is expected to occur by the end 
of this year

pessimism enveloped relatives of american expatriates as gulf 
tensions moved up another notch and iraq said foreigners there and 
in kuwait would be the first to suffer if a us economic blockade 
makes food and medicine scarce 
the latest iraqi statement about the detainees could be just 
more chestthumping said donnita cole of odessa texas whose 
50yearold husband john henry cole was working for an oil company 
in kuwait she added 
i think weve got a big problem on our hands and i dont 
think protocol is going to work anymore i think were going into a 
war 
this is i guess what we thought about and hoped it wouldnt 
be a problem said bob nickman of pleasonton neb 
nickman whose son mike is stranded in iraq said he feared 
americans and other foreigners might suffer more than iraqis from 
any shortages 
the iraqi people would probably favor themselves he said 
thats natural 
iraq which imports threefourths of its food said iraqi and 
foreign babies and elderly people will be the first to feel the 
effect as the nation ensures that food goes to its soldiers first 
the baghdad government is detaining 3000 americans 4000 
britons and about 14000 other westerners among the more than 2 
million foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait when iraqs president 
saddam hussein invaded kuwait 
in a television interview broadcast friday on abc news mike 
nickman said he would like to leave iraq as long as theres 
anything possible that could happen here 
i would rather be out of here the blondhaired nickman said 
calmly adding i miss my kids 
in brockton mass dennis trundy husband of mary trundy whose 
twin brother is in kuwait said of the iraqi statement 
how do you react to that its just insane this whole thing 
is mess i dont know how theyre going to get them out i have a 
feeling it will come to a conflict theyre not free to go 
mary trundys brother 43yearold john stevenson had been 
working as a computer systems analyst for a bank in kuwait 
for the trundys the tense wait is familiar in 1979 they waited 
several days as stevenson escaped from iran just hours before 
militants took over the the us embassy in tehran stevenson had 
been working for a computer firm in iran its like history 
repeating itself trundy said 
mrs cole whose 50yearold husband john henry cole is among 
the detainees said she has two sons in the army one on his way to 
saudi arabia and the other on standby and a soninlaw in the air 
force whos also on standby 
im worried to death she said ive known they were 
serious all along this has been serious since the day it started 
because you have to remember who youre dealing with 
a tearful marjorie walterscheid of jacksboro texas said she is 
very upset about the statement but it hasnt changed her opinion 
about the outlook for her husband rainard walterscheid 52 
well i dont know that its made a big change in my attitude 
because ive considered them hostages from the beginning she 
said im angry today because there hasnt been anything done to 
get them out i want my husband out without bloodshed i think it 
should have been negotiated 
i want my husband home i have loved this country for 49 
years and i think my country should love me enough to bring my 
husband home 
even before saturdays announcement people like patricia heath 
of farmington hills mich were getting pessimistic 
her brother kevin bazner his wife dawn and their children 
elizabeth 6 and david 6 months were stranded after their plane 
stopped in kuwait to refuel during the aug 2 invasion by iraq 
after iraq announced friday that it was detaining the americans 
along with citizens of other western countries heath was dismayed 
when i first heard that i was real negative and it was 
probably the worst day ive had heath said 
this is the hardest thing up to this time we knew their 
routine and now that is gone we dont know where they are said 
virginia bazner kevin and patricias mother from her home in 
palms desert calif home our strength is beginning to wane

president bush on saturday signed a 
bill prompted by the alaska oil spill setting tougher standards 
for ship construction and authorizing a 1 billion fund to cover 
cleanup costs and damages not paid by the spiller 
bush complained that the measure contained a highly 
objectionable moratorium on exploration for oil and natural gas 
off the coast of north carolinas outer banks 
such a moratorium is illadvised in view of recent events in 
the persian gulf where i have found it necessary to deploy american 
soldiers 7000 miles from home to protect our vital national 
interests the president said 
he said his administration would seek repeal of the ban 
saying that gas exploration carries little environmental risk 
bush said it is shortsighted to restrict exploration for this 
relatively clean energy source 
the bill spurred toward passage by the 11milliongallon spill 
by the exxon valdez in alaska requires double hull construction of 
oil tankers and sets new crew licensing and manning requirements 
for oil ships 
bush said the act addresses the wideranging problems 
associated with preventing responding to and paying for oil 
spills 
it does so he added by creating a comprehensive regime 
for dealing with vessel and facilitycaused oil pollution 
the president said a 1 billion trust fund will be available to 
cover cleanup costs and damages not compensated by the spiller 
however he said the spillers financial responsibility 
requirements are greatly increased

in 1938 as hitlers army swarmed into vienna 10 
jewish youngsters in their last year of high school met to say 
their goodbyes and made a pact 
this was no ordinary class farewell but a somber one against a 
backdrop of antisemitic violence and the knowledge that if they 
stayed they were doomed they knew they were about to become 
refugees so they promised one another they would meet again if 
they survived 
on friday night they did 
they traveled to london from homes in australia israel the 
united states and england to dine on champagne and wiener schnitzel 
and resurrect longforgotten childhood memories of soccer matches 
and monopoly games at affi aufrichtigs house on heinzelmanngasse 
where they met for the last time 
each dinner place had a card with a nickname affi dufschi 
kiwi mond and a yellowing photo their last group portrait 
before they fled 
one chair remained empty mandel mandi haber disappeared 
during world war ii his refugee boat apparently torpedoed by a 
german submarine his name was by his plate all the same at the 
head of the table 
they were 70 years old now with wives and grownup children 
they had been friends since the age of six and still retained 
their oldworld central european manners and viennese accents 
laced with an american or australian twang 
leo sherwin fled to shanghai then settled in melbourne 
australia george kane made it to sydney australia ken hurst ken 
miller and bert binder reached england affi aufrichtig otto 
neugasser and bobby postman settled in israel 
david dufschi rosenbluth now living in south nyack ny 
didnt even know until last june that the others were still alive 
i had completely lost track of them he said 
the pact stipulated a reunion outside the tel aviv post office 
on july 17 1948 and the three who had reached israel turned up 
then through newspaper ads and the international red cross others 
were gradually located finally only rosenbluth remained to be 
traced 
hurst finally tracked him down through the austrian government 
pension fund telephoned him in south nyack and invited him to 
london 
when ken hurst phoned me all these things that i hadnt 
thought of for 50 years started coming back to me he said 
sitting in the czechoslovak club where the dinner was held 
the street we lived on where we went to the opera to soccer 
games and now it seems to me as though no time has elapsed at 
all because i can see how they were not how they are theyre 
still little boys 
hurst became a toolmaker then a manufacturer of christmas 
crackers sherwin was an electrician rosenbluth opened a 
watchrepair store in manhattan while his parents emigrated to 
israel 
someone at the reunion remarked that hitler was dead and the 
youngsters he had driven into exile had survived and prospered 
rosenbluth exclaimed and we have a state israel 
its great unbelievable sometimes i just cant fathom the 
things that are happening he said 
some of the men have visited vienna since the war but say they 
felt no connection to the place rosenbluth said he felt an 
undercurrent of antisemitism 
hurst went back in 1980 having been offered a job there he 
revisited his old house and the street where the nazis forced him 
to clean graffiti off a sidewalk with a toothbrush 
i felt like a stranger who spoke the language i went to 
school and grew up there but i just felt that i didnt belong 
he said 
after six weeks he moved back to england

about 50000 people cheered saturday as 
prodemocracy activists called for the end of nearly two decades of 
oneparty rule it was the first such rally in 17 years 
the rally was the biggest political gathering since zambias 
independence in 1964 organizers said 
prodemocracy leaders chose kabwe for their first display of 
mass support because president kenneth kaundas ruling party was 
founded in this provincial mining center 112 miles north of the 
capital lusaka 
frederick chiluba head of the powerful zambia congress of trade 
unions told the thousands of cheering supporters that their 
presence showed that kaundas united national independence party 
had been abandoned by its followers 
i have come to kabwe with an open invitation to ask you to 
board the ship going to democracy chiluba said holding up his 
index finger as the symbol of the multiparty campaign 
the hour has come for you to divorce the oneparty system 
chiluba said 
more than 300 police and troops some of them armed surrounded 
the 5hour gathering which dispersed peacefully 
organizers said scores of supporters were bussed to the rally 
from most parts of the country 
in a carnival atmosphere buses trucks and cars heading to and 
from kabwe honked their horns as drivers and passengers exchanged 
greetings 
chiluba and fellow officials of the national interim committee 
for multiparty democracy were carried shoulderhigh by supporters 
who sang zambias national anthem many wore tshirts bearing the 
heartshaped legend i love multiparty 
addressing the rally campaign chairman arthur wina a former 
finance minister accused kaunda of bankrupting this southern 
african nation of 75 million people zambia ranks among the 
worlds poorest countries 
we are confident nothing can be worse than the present 
system wina said 
kaunda 66 led the british colony of northern rhodesia to 
independence the colony was then renamed zambia 
oneparty rule was imposed in 1973 and kaunda has been 
unchallenged as president virtually ever since 
in june however police opened fire on people rioting over a 
dramatic increase in food prices at least 27 people died in the 
rioting mainly in police and army gunfire 
the bloodshed and price increases sparked demands for kaundas 
ouster 
kaunda responded by freeing political prisoners ending a night 
curfew and allowing opponents to campaign for a referendum on 
zambias political future that is scheduled for next august 
the prodemocracy committee is backed by trade union leaders 
businessmen students and former politicians 
kaunda has said he will campaign vigorously to maintain 
oneparty rule and has accused prodemocracy activists of waging a 
political war against him financed by foreigners prodemocracy 
leaders have denied receiving foreign funds

a man caught up in a mail order frenzy 
used phony names to order about 200000 worth of merchandise up 
to 50 boxes a day and simply threw the bills away police said 
thomas j hoffmann 35 used five post office boxes and 227 
aliases to receive the catalog merchandise said sgt randy crowe 
he was charged thursday with three counts of theft 
police recovered enough goods from hoffmanns home and two 
storage rooms to nearly fill an 8000squarefoot postal service 
warehouse crowe said 
sixteen officers spent six hours thursday sorting through the 
orders so they could be returned among them were books magazines 
clothes porcelain plates globes videotapes and more than 600 
compact discs 
he told us this was kind of something that snowballed on 
him crowe said he did it for a little while and then he kept 
getting more packages in and he got to the point where he didnt 
know what to do with the stuff 
hoffmann placed his first order about a year ago said crowe 
packages poured in from about 60 companies across the country 
other charges were possible but only three companies were 
verified as victims thursday crowe said 
hoffmann was released thursday night from east baton rouge 
parish prison on a 20000 signature bond 
the investigation began when one of the mailorder firms 
notified a postal inspector of a problem at one hoffmanns post

executives of the st petersburg 
times said settlement of a stock dispute left them weighing a 
professional commitment to tell all against a corporate decision to 
keep mum 
we may have to wrestle with the fact that were being attacked 
for not doing what we wish we could do but there it is times 
publishing chairman andrew barnes said 
the times publishing co and a minority investor group led by 
texas billionaire robert m bass announced on friday the settlement 
of a bitter monthslong stock feud involving the states 
secondlargest paper 
the parties put out a joint statement on the agreement but 
significant details were not addressed such as the amount of 
money exchanged and the percentage of ownership bass maintains 
in the threepage statement they said they agreed not to 
comment further on terms of the settlement 
barnes told the newsroom friday that most details of the 
settlement were kept secret and must remain so under the pact 
it puts the times a newspaper that crusades for openness in 
an awkward even embarrassing position but barnes said this 
consideration is outweighed by something more important ensuring 
the newspapers independence the times reported saturday 
both sides said they were pleased with the agreement which 
barnes said ensured longterm journalistic control of the newspaper 
the bass group called the poynterjamison ventures limited 
partnership dropped its federal suit in return the times agreed 
to call in stock that was at the center of the dispute the bass 
group bought 200 shares in the papers parent company times 
publishing co two years ago from the nieces of the late nelson 
poynter longtime publisher 
the bass partners sued the times in february claiming that 
their 200 shares which represented 40 percent of the publishing 
companys common stock brought only 6 percent of the companys 
dividends 
most of the publishing companys dividends have gone to the 
poynter institute for media studies a notforprofit journalism 
school set up by poynter the institute holds controlling interest 
in times publishing which owns the newspaper congressional 
quarterly and other magazines 
times attorney george rahdert who usually argues for openness 
on behalf of the newspaper said he doesnt see where the secrecy 
agreement should have any bearing on the papers pursuit of 
information about court settlements in other cases 
i dont foresee this being a problem this is a private 
business transaction he said adding that the company was not a 
public body 
but clearly rahdert didnt view the settlement as any big 
conquest for the times 
i wouldnt really characterize this as a victory he said 
its a resolution of a thorny problem

two west german political leaders on saturday 
urged east german lawmakers to decide this week to merge with west 
germany saying overwhelming economic and political problems make 
quick action essential 
every day that it is delayed the crisis is worsened and the 
costs of unity are driven upward said ingrid matthaeusmaier 
deputy chief of the social democratic faction in the west german 
parliament 
she told the west german newspaper bild am sonntag that the 
historic decision should be made when the east german parliament 
meets on wednesday 
erwin huber general secretary of the west german christian 
social union also said in an interview with the newspaper that his 
party supports rapid unity hubers party is the bavarian sister 
party of the christian democrats of west german chancellor helmut 
kohl 
the leftleaning social democrats are the secondlargest party 
in the broad governing coalition of east german prime minister 
lothar de maiziere the social democrats are the opposition in the 
west german parliament 
the east geman social democrats are to vote on sunday whether to 
leave the coalition following the latest of many threats it has 
made to break up the nations first democratically chosen cabinet 
the social democrats are angry that de maiziere unilaterally 
fired four cabinet ministers on wednesday 
even if the social democrats left his coalition de maiziere 
would still be able to run the government and german unity still 
would likely take place by years end 
all the major parties are committed to german unity and single 
german elections are tentatively set for dec 2 
however the social democrats and the christian democrats of de 
maiziere and west german chancellor helmut kohl still differ over a 
state treaty that is to spell out the details of a political merger 
and reconcile the differing laws of the nations 
the two parties also have been trying to use the timing and pace 
of unification to their best political advantage the prolonged 
political dispute has virtually paralyzed the unification debate 
however pressure appeared to be building saturday for east 
germany to end its political squabbling and move quickly on 
unification 
joblessness has been rising as east german factories struggle 
against competition from the west since the nation converted to a 
free market on july 1 
united german elections are tentatively set for dec 2 kohl 
failed in his attempt to get the elections moved up to oct 14 
when east germany is to hold state elections 
east germany must enact a clause in the west german constitution 
in order to unify with west germany 
the christian democrats want unity and elections to take place 
almost simultaneously the social democrats say they want 
unification to take place quickly but that it doesnt have to be 
tied to elections

killers and rapists whose victims were white got 
more severe punishment than those whose victims were black or 
hispanic in a newspaper survey of sentencing in dallas county in 
1988 
a story in sundays dallas times herald said a review of cases 
that year showed a conviction for the murder of a white person 
resulted in an average prison sentence of 30 years that compared 
with 20 years for the murder of a black person and 12 years for a 
hispanic 
the rape of a white resulted in a median sentence of 10 years 
compared with two years for the rape of a black and five years for 
a hispanic 
the punishment almost doubled when the attacker and victim were 
of different races the newspaper reported 
except for such interracial crimes sentencing disparities were 
much less pronounced for attempted murder and aggravated assault 
the newspaper said 
david baldus an iowa law professor who has studied race effects 
in death penalty cases said the study suggests that whitevictim 
crime particularly rape is treated quite differently in 
dallas 
scott anderson president of the dallas county criminal bar 
association was more blunt 
the systems racist he said most people are struggling 
to overcome it but it exists it starts all the way down in the 
police department and goes all the way to the top of the district 
attorneys office 
district attorney john vance said texas should follow the lead 
of congress and 31 states that have reformed the sentencing process 
to eliminate unjustifiable disparities 
i think we need to take a real serious look at the federal 
system of sentencing guidelines and thats the only time ive 
ever said that in my life said vance through plea bargaining 
his office effectively sets punishment in more than 90 percent of 
such felonies 
in the study the times herald noted legal factors that affect 
punishment including previous felony convictions aggravating 
circumstances and multiple offenses punished by the same sentence 
judges prosecutors and legal experts propose numerous theories 
for the sentencing inequities including the quality of legal aid 
for indigent defendants the reluctance of minorities to testify 
and juryimposed sentencing 
a university of new mexico sociologist who has studied the 
criminal justice systems handling of rape says the unequal 
punishment in cases involving black and white victims is a vestige 
of slavery days 
at one point in our history rapes were treated differently by 
law if a black man raped a white woman and i think you still have 
lingering effects of that said gary lafree author of the 1989 
book rape and criminal justice 
state district judge pat mcdowell said the victims social 
status also was a factor in sentencing 
a prosecutor can make a much stronger argument in favor of 
severe punishment when the victim is an upstanding contributing 
member of the community than he can if the victim is a street 
person mcdowell said 
it really shouldnt be that way he said but 
unfortunately thats part of our society 
jury sentencing disparities reflect the kind of jurors we have 
in dallas county said lawyer adelfa b callejo 
subconsciously i think the attitude is that the life of a 
white person is worth more than the life of a black or hispanic 
she said but its not just in the courts its apparent in every 
aspect of life in dallas

saudi arabia is ready to increase 
its oil output by up to 2 million barrels a day to help offset the 
world shortfall caused by the iraqi invasion of kuwait the oil 
minister indicated saturday 
oil minister hisham nazer told a news conference in jiddah that 
his country would have no alternative but to increase oil 
production unilaterally if opec does not convene an emergency 
meeting requested by saudi arabia 
if the opec session fails to get off the ground then it will 
be left for each member state to decide alone on the increase in 
output he told the western and saudi journalists 
immediately means immediately he said when asked how long 
the saudis will wait for the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to schedule a meeting 
he said that saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter 
could increase its output by up to 2 million barrels a day within 
days 
but he said saudi arabia alone cannot make up for the 4 million 
barrels of oil a day that international markets lost by the removal 
of iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
by invading and annexing kuwait iraq gained control of about 20 
percent of the worlds oil reserves and the withdrawal of its 
crude from the market has caused oil and gas prices to soar 
most nations have declared support for un sanctions against 
baghdad including an oil embargo 
nazer said venezuela and the united arab emirates each could 
increase output by 500000 barrels a day but this would leave us 
with 1 million barrels less 
in georgetown guyana venezuelan president carlos andres perez 
told reporters friday he favors convening an opec meeting soon but 
did not indicate when it might take place 
he said opec has an obligation to maintain stability in the oil 
market 
nazer said the saudis are awaiting responses to their request 
for an opec meeting he criticized some opec members such as 
nigeria which have resisted holding another meeting less than a 
month after the oil exporters last session in switzerland 
the last meeting on july 2627 in geneva came after iraq accused 
kuwait and the united arab emirates of flooding the market with oil 
and driving down prices 
at that meeting opec fixed a production ceiling of almost 225 
million barrels a day for the 13 member nations to defend a 
21abarrel price saudi arabia agreed to a production quota of 
538 million barrels a day 
nazer commented now this has all been changed the price now 
stands at 28 per barrel and the daily production figure is far 
less than 224 million the shortage of 4 million barrels a day can 
increase if the tension continues 
all opec members together should make up for this shortage 
we will not let the third world countries down and so will 
increase production 
nazer said failure to stabilize oil prices and production would 
not only devastate developing nations but also hurt opec in the 
long run 
less oil would lead to higher prices in the marketplace trigger 
a recession among industrial nations and spur them to develop 
alternative energy sources he said 
he suggested that the oil situation could improve if the united 
states and other industrialized countries open their strategic 
stockpiles to the market 
the reporters were invited by the saudi government to travel to 
the red sea city of jidday about 1000 miles from where thousands 
of us troops and other members of a multinational force are 
deploying on the persian gulf 
oil industry sources in saudi arabia told the associated press 
on friday that the kingdom would increase its output 
saudi arabia is the dominant opec state with a quarter of known 
world reserves 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity predicted that 
the opec session called by saudi arabia would convene monday or 
tuesday in geneva 
they did not say what might happen if not all opec members 
agreed to participate 
iraq has criticized saudi arabia for calling the meeting saying 
the saudis created the shortfall by blocking iraqi oil exports from 
the transsaudi oil pipeline 
in saudi arabias first direct official comment nazer confirmed 
that his country had turned away two iraqi tankers that tried to 
load oil from the pipeline terminal he said it did so after the 
un security council resolution on sanctions 
meanwhile the turmoil in the middle east where thousands of 
us troops are being deployed to defend saudi arabia against a 
possible iraqi attack continued to create havoc on world markets 
unleaded gasoline hit a record high friday on the new york 
mercantile exchange as crude oil prices shot up and speculators 
kept betting that the middle east standoff would curtail supplies 
september wholesale unleaded gas futures soared to as high as 
9625 cents before settling at 9597 cents per gallon up 85 cents 
from thursdays record close 
the september contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude finished up 127 at 2863 per barrel 
for the week september crude rose 240 per barrel while 
unleaded gasoline was up 165 cents a gallon

a lebanese shiite moslem who claims he 
escaped from prison in kuwait during the iraqi invasion said 
saturday that 15 convicted terrorists linked to kidnappers in 
lebanon also fled from jail 
a shiite fundamentalist group islamic jihad which has been 
holding americans terry anderson and thomas sutherland for more 
than five years had demanded the release of the 15 prisoners in 
return for freeing the two americans 
the lebanese who said he escaped abdelaziz krayyem said 
saturday he was imprisoned in 1985 on charges of cooperating with 
the 15 mostly iranian and iraqi shiites convicted in the 1983 
bombing of the us and french embassies as well as kuwaiti 
installations 
krayyem said he was among 1600 prisoners who overpowered their 
guards and escaped when they heard about the invasion he said the 
15 were among those who got out 
i saw them climbing into taxicabs with kuwaiti plate 
numbers krayyem said and the cars sped away thats all i 
saw 
however the report could not be independently verified 
earlier unconfirmed reports speculated that the 15 had either 
been taken to baghdad or executed 
krayyem said he had no idea of the current whereabouts of the 15 
he said he hid out for 10 days with kuwaiti inmates who got 
their families to collect them after the jailbreak the lebanese 
embassy issued a new passport for him and he joined a car convoy 
sponsored by the embassy that passed through saudi arabia then 
jordan syria and lebanon he said 
krayyem 35 arrived friday in his hometown of yater 56 miles 
south of beirut 
he said he was first jailed for a few days with the convicts 
then numbering 17 before he was placed in isolation at kuwaits 
central prison 
two of the 17 original prisoners were released in february 1989 
after serving fiveyear sentences the kuwaitis refused to free any 
of the others before completion of sentences most ranging to 15 
years 
kuwaits emir had not signed several death sentences 
effectively commuting them to life 
kuwaiti interrogators linked krayyem to the 15 for having 
explosives in his house but he said he was framed believe me i 
had nothing to do with them he krayyem said kuwaiti prison 
guards told the inmates about the invasion 
chaos broke out immediately and the prisoners started shouting 
at the guards the guards fired at them killing an iraqi and an 
afghani prisoner krayyem said 
after a few hours of fighting with the guards the prisoners 
were able to occupy the prison and overthrow the guards he said 
there are 14 western hostages held in lebanon including six 
americans the longest held is anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16

us warships fired shots in an effort to 
stop two iraqi tankers saturday the first such confrontation in 
the persian gulf crisis iraq warned of grave consequences if 
it happens again 
the united states said the gunfire involved only warning shots 
but iraq said us ships had shot at the iraqi vessels 
also saturday iraq called the economic embargo against it an 
act of war and said thousands of foreigners it holds will go 
hungry along with iraqis the embargo was imposed in the wake of 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
baghdad also threatened to use weapons of mass destruction 
against any attackers the weapons were not specified but iraq has 
chemical weapons and longrange missiles 
in the confrontation on the high seas oil minister issam 
chalabi said us warships had fired on two iraqi oil tankers the 
baba karkar in the persian gulf and the khanaqin in the gulf of 
oman 
a us administration source with president bush in 
kennebunkport maine confirmed us forces had fired to stop two 
iraqi ships one in the persian gulf and the other in the gulf of 
oman to the south in each case warning shots were fired after 
bridgetobridge communications the source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the shots were the first fired in the 2dayold interdiction 
effort ordered by bush to halt goods leaving and entering iraq 
military sources in dubai the united arab emirates said the 
two incidents occurred about an hour apart around dusk 
the two 3600ton guidedmissile frigates involved the uss reid 
and uss robert g bradley are both part of the navys regular gulf 
task force and had been on duty in the region before the aug 2 
iraqi invasion of kuwait the two ships also saw service escorting 
usflagged kuwaiti tankers in 198788 during the iraqiran war 
a us navy official who briefed reporters traveling with 
defense secretary dick cheney said that in the gulf of oman 
incident the reid fired warning shots across the bow of an iraqi 
oil tanker the official said us forces briefly went to battle 
stations during the incident 
the khanaqin which was loaded with oil refused repeated 
requests to halt and the reid fired six warning shots across the 
tankers bow the military sources said 
the weapon used could not be immediately confirmed but was 
believed to be the 76mm gun located amidships on the top deck the 
sources said 
in the next incident the uss robert g bradley homeported in 
charleston sc intercepted another iraqi tanker inside the 
persian gulf and fired three warning shots across its bow when it 
refused to stop the sources said 
both tankers are continuing under way but are under close 
us surveillance said a us military official on condition of 
anonymity 
us military officials have indicated that if iraqi ships 
ignored warnings to stop the next move might be to attempt to 
disable them by shooting at their rudders or propellers 
chalabi said the shots came after the ships refused to allow 
themselves to be searched according to a statement carried by the 
official iraqi news agency he said the shots did not strike the 
ships and they proceeded without stopping 
the oil ministry of the iraqi republic therefore warns that 
any interception of its tankers and their crews will result in 
grave consequences which the american authorities bear 
responsibility for he said 
the threat that foreigners held in iraq would suffer the same 
shortages of food as the iraqi public came in a statement from the 
ministry of labor and social affairs also carried by the iraqi 
news agency and monitored in nicosia cyprus 
the baghdad government holds 3000 americans 4000 britons and 
about 14000 other westerners among the more than 2 million 
foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait after the invasion 
iraq singled out the united states for the blame in blocking 
food supplies accusing washington of going beyond the mandatory 
un sanctions in denying iraq food and medicine and in acting 
militarily to prevent shipments 
such an act by international law is known as an act of war 
said the iraqi statement 
the iraqis said the blockade would deny children their milk 
medication and other necessities and said foreign children would 
be subject to the same restrictions 
we have decided to place the children of foreign families 
which iraq has decided to host in equality with the children of 
iraq and what affects the children of iraq will equally affect 
them said the statement 
iraq said its military would be given priority in the 
distribution of supplies because they are the shield of the 
nation 
the latest statement came a day after the iraqi parliament 
speaker sadi mahdi saleh said the foreigners would be held as 
long as the threat of war persists a multinational force of 
thousands of troops spearheaded by the united states was deployed 
in saudi arabia to defend it against possible iraqi attack in the 
wake of the invasion 
the people of iraq have decided to play host to the citizens 
of these aggressive nations as long as iraq remains threatened with 
an aggressive war the iraqi official said then 
the iraqi government later said the statement did not apply to 
egyptians more than 15 million egyptians make up the bulk of 
guest workers in iraq and kuwait 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz warned that arabs could follow 
a us precedent to intercept shipping and hinted at a blockade of 
the red sea about 10 percent of the worlds oil flows through the 
sea up to the suez canal 
yemen which controls the mandab straits at the southern end of 
the red sea is sympathetic to iraq 
traffic through the suez canal the other end of the red sea 
from the mandab straits averages 50 ships daily about one third 
of the annual traffic is oil tankers both from the persian gulf 
and eastern saudi ports the oil going through the canal counts for 
about 10 percent of the worlds seaborne oil trade 
the threat regarding use of weapons on mass destruction came in 
the iraqi army daily newspaper alqaddasiyah it said weapons of 
mass destruction and strategic deterrence possessed by iraq will be 
lying in wait to turn those who contemplate committing aggression 
into scattered pieces 
iraq has used poison gas against iran during their eightyear 
war and against its own kurdish minority

the three also were convicted of charges stemming from an attack 
on two male joggers in the park that night 
according to prosecutors the woman was jogging through the 
northern end of the park at about 10 pm at night when she was 
attacked she was dragged about 70 feet into the woods gangraped 
and bashed repeatedly with a brick 
the jogger trial had become controversial for unexpected reasons 
while the womans recovery from neartotal paralysis was 
inspirational to some new yorkers a few activists including the 
controversial rev al sharpton demonstrated daily outside the 
courthouse claiming the youths were railroaded because they were 
black and the victim white 
the jury made its decision at the close of its 10th day of 
deliberations 
salaam and mccray both gave videotaped statements in which they 
confessed to being part of a gang that assaulted the woman much of 
the defenses case rested on its claim that the testimony was given 
under duress 
earlier saturday the jurors had asked for the fourth time since 
they began deliberations to see the videotaped statement of mccray 
in which he told police he kicked the jogger and feigned sex with 
her to impress his friends

hildebrandt who interviewed mccray after his arrest 
the detective testified he offered mccray no deal in return for 
his statement the boys father bobby testified he encouraged his 
son to talk because he was led to believe there was an agreement

this is a statement issued saturday by 
the iraqi ministry of labor and social affairs it was monitored 
and translated by the associated press 
in light of the decision taken by the representatives of the 
iraqi people and announced by the president of the national council 
yesterday which asserted that the iraqi people are a peaceful 
people who want peace and refuse war and those who call for it and 
in light of the fact that the iraqis have not attacked the west and 
its legal interests and because some western countries have 
declared enmity to the iraqi people through us provocation and 
because the us and whoever cooperates with her are pushing 
towards war against iraq in addition to its occupation of arab 
land and the sanctities of the moslems in hijaz and najd saudi 
arabia and because the presence of westerners in iraq is probably 
one of the means which will achieve peace and prevent aggression 
and war and make the american president and his allies reconsider 
their aggressive policies therefore the ministry of labor and 
social affairs announces the following 
1 america and its allies have surpassed the economic boycott 
which in its core means no exchange of buying or selling only 
instead they proceeded with applying an economic seige by military 
force against iraq which includes food and medication and such an 
act by international law is known as act of war and has led and 
will lead to a shortage in imported food and goods including 
childrens milk and because the children of the world are beloved 
of god and of saddam hussein and in compliance with our 
humanitarian principles we have decided the following 
to place the children of foreign families which iraq has decided 
to host in equality with the children of iraq and if the childrens 
milk medication and other necessities should become scarce due to 
the boycott what affects the children of iraq will equally affect 
them foreign children 
2 due to the circumstances of boycott and economic seige which 
have been imposed by the united states by military means food will 
not be available to all adults in the amounts we would wish the 
peoples of europe in particular the british have gone through 
such an experience or something resembling it before therefore 
they understand the circumstances and the arrangements 
its natural in such a situation to give priority in terms of 
quality and quantity of food to the armed forces because it is the 
shield of the nation and the people against aggression and to the 
workers in warrelated factories and industries and give others a 
different level of attention also because foreigners will not be 
in the armed forces or any of the activities related to that 
therefore their share of food in terms of quality and quantity with 
other iraqis will be affected by our import of food in one way or 
the other 
3 based on number 2 and in order to ensure the level and 
quantity of food needed for both foreigners and iraqis the right 
solution is to put an end to the sanctions which the united states 
have imposed on iraq and the economic siege which president bush 
and his allies are working on implementing by military force and in 
an individual manner and as a fast and advanced procedure not to 
boycott everything related with food medication and goods of 
humanitarian nature 
we call on families of foreigners in iraq and all those who are 
in solidarity with them humanitarian societies in the west and the 
world to raise their voices to achieve these noble humanitarian 
goals 
may god bless those who call for peace and love and refuse war 
and aggression

in its latest statement saturday iraq made clear that it hopes 
to use those foreign captives to force the lifting of economic 
sanctions imposed on it it and to prevent usled forces from 
invading kuwait or iraq 
saturdays statement which referred to the us quarantine as a 
blockade and an act of war said that as food and medicine 
become scarce in iraq supplies will be set aside for the military 
iraqs the shield of the homeland 
the statement referred specifically to us military moves to 
enforce the international embargo on iraqi goods and oil 
bush has authorized the interdiction of shipments to iraq a 
move that has drawn criticism from some us allies and also from 
un secretarygeneral perez de cuellar who approved the economic 
sanctions the united states has refused to use the word 
blockade 
iraq which imports threequarters of its food suggested in the 
statement that foreigners whose countries have experienced wars in 
the past will understand the iraqi decision to reserve needed 
supplies for its military 
the peoples of europe in particular the british have gone 
through such an experience or something resembling it before 
said the statement which was carried on iraqi telvision and read 
by an unidentified announcer 
children and the elderly among the foreign nationals would feel 
the effects of shortages along with their iraqi counterparts it 
said 
because of the embargo food cannot be secured for aged 
persons in the manner that we wish the statement said if 
there were to be any reduction in the necessities of babies then 
the same calamity affecting the iraqi newborn will affect similarly 
the foreign babies 
the right solution is for the embargo to end which the united 
states deliberately imposed on the iraqis the statement said 
the white house said on saturday that iraqs holding of american 
and other foreign citizens is totally unacceptable 
bush who was vacantioning in kennebunkport maine called on 
iraq to immediately reconsider its refusal to let the foreigners 
leave 
the use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what iraq 
sees to be its selfinterest is contrary to international law and 
indeed to all accepted norms of international conduct white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we urge that iraq immediately reconsider its refusal to allow 
any foreign national desiring to leave to do so without delay or 
condition he said 
britain called iraqs threat to detain westerners unlawful and 
inhuman and said it would not be deterred from helping defend 
persian gulf states against iraqi aggression

war bands battled with axes spears 
and knives and ritually mutilated the bodies of their enemies 
saturday as the death toll from a week of tribal fighting rose to 
at least 222 hundreds were injured 
fighting flared in parts of soweto and tokoza townships when 
large groups of heavily armed xhosas tried to attack hostels 
housing migrant zulu workers 
zulus fought back with guns and sharpedged weapons and went on 
a rampage in tokoza driving off the attackers 
we were just drinking and being happy said a zulu called 
steven who was armed with two spears and a cowhide shield they 
came to kill us they want to drive us out but we will kill them 
the government ordered troops into the townships to support 
police in trying to halt the fighting police and soldiers in 
armored vehicles fired tear gas and shotguns to break up clashes 
lines of police vehicles drove between rival groups to keep them 
apart 
the fighting appeared to have developed primarily into a tribal 
battle earlier clashes had pitted xhosas of the african national 
congress and zulus of the more conservative inkatha movement but 
many township residents said people who did not belong to the two 
groups were fighting along tribal lines 
the bloody conflict erupted last sunday in tokoza east of 
johannesburg and spread during the week to four more areas 
including soweto southwest of johannesburg 
the fighting is the worst in the townships in years local press 
reports say 
police officials said at least 222 people had been killed but 
the toll probably was higher because some bodies had been removed 
before police could count them 
zulus at tokoza ritually castrated the bodies of dead xhosas and 
cut off hands waving the severed parts in victory dances zulus 
believe mutilation robs enemies of their strength and makes the 
victor stronger 
a mob of about 1500 zulus in tokoza beat their axes and spears 
against shields chanting war cries police in armored vehicles 
surrounded the fighters to keep them from attacking nearby xhosa 
houses 
the countrys top police official gen johann van der merwe 
announced the deployment of soldiers and more police 
this strong contingent will do everything possible to stop the 
senseless violence he said in a statement but officials would 
give no details on how many troops were being deployed 
we will kill the xhosas they are rubbish we will kill them 
all declared richard zulu leader of a war band 
xhosas were demanding that all zulus leave the townships 
claiming they had no right to live there and should return to their 
native natal province they blamed zulus for starting the fighting 
a terrified xhosa youth armed with several iron bars said we 
must protect ourselves or they will kill us 
in soweto police with assault rifles and shotguns roared 
through streets in armored vehicles and trucks youths who erected 
barricades with rocks and burning car tires were dispersed with 
tear gas 
a soweto city councillor was killed by a mob outside his house 
saturday police spokesman lt g mariemuthoo said the man 
identified as ta nkina had his throat slit when he confronted 
the crowd with a firearm the police spokesman said black 
officials are seen as turncoats who support the whiteled 
government 
also saturday thousands of black protesters marched through the 
conservative northern transvaal town of welkom and police reported 
one marcher injured by a crossbow shot the march was to protest 
high rents and lack of civic services 
no other incidents were reported as the estimated 5000 marchers 
walked danced and sang past police roadblocks and vehicles set up 
to protect them from threatened violence by rightwing whites 
also saturday about 20000 people marched peacefully through 
the town of vereeniging near johannesburg to protest political 
violence the african national congress and congress of south 
african trade unions organized that march 
the anc accused the governments security forces of plotting to 
use inkatha to stir up tribal rivalry in the townships around 
johannesburg more than 5000 people have died in fighting between 
inkatha and anc supporters in the eastern natal province in the 
past five years 
inkatha president mangosuthu buthelezi said anc supporters 
insult and attack inkatha members causing conflict 
many zulus involved in the fighting in the townships said they 
would not accept the anc and its leader nelson mandela as a 
future government 
mandela has been negotiating with president fw de klerk on 
clearing the way for a new constitution to give political power to 
south africas black majority

the army asked the reservists to list three hospitals where they 
would prefer to work although officials will not guarantee where 
they would be sent

hospital the doctors nurses and other medical workers could avoid 
going to the middle east if president bush calls up medical 
reserves later 
army reserve administrators in santa ana san bernardino and 
riverside began calling about 120 medical personnel on thursday 
asking them to decide within 24 hours if they would work at an army 
hospital in the united states

that the army medical staff is used up and moved out to the middle 
east said walter shelton staff administrator at the 6252nd army 
hospital in ventura which oversees local medical reserve units 
shelton said the response has been positive so far but he 
declined to say how many people have signed up 
one orange county nurse who asked that she not be identified 
said she decided to accept rather than risk being sent overseas 
later 
the thought of winding up somewhere far away far from my 
family is a real fear and im just not sure im willing to take 
that chance said the nurse an army reservist for 17 years

epidemic

it is the first law ever enacted to provide health grants to states 
and localities to fight a specific disease

treasure hunters who have spent nearly five years 
dodging storms and pirates around the bahamas say they finally may 
be on the trail of the mother lode from a sunken 17th century 
galleon 
in the past few weeks the crew of the research vessel beacon 
have found dozens of valuable artifacts from the spanish ship 
nuestra senora de las maravillas which was carrying a cargo 
worth 16 billion 
meanwhile at another wreck site off the florida coast five 
rare gold ingots raised last week are part of the first big haul 
from what is believed to be a treasureladen spanish galleon from a 
1622 fleet 
the gleaming finger ingots each weighing 1 pounds 11 
silver coins 15 ceramic containers a pair of brass sextons and an 
emerald ring were among the treasures displayed saturday they were 
discovered during the first two weeks of intensive searching of the 
1500footdeep site using a remotecontrolled robot 
weve literally just scratched the surface of the wreck 
site said dan bagley a director of seahawk deep ocean 
technology the company recovering the nameless wreck which is 
about 25 miles south of the dry tortugas west of key west 
in the maravillas project one investor said the latest 
discovery makes the long search worthwhile among the treasures 
recovered so far are nearly 80 gold coins ivory daggers and a gold 
brooch decorated with 80 emeralds matching a similar piece found 
two years ago 
the thrilling nature of this business certainly hits home when 
you get to hold an item that has been on the ocean floor for almost 
335 years said gary skeen 
project spokeswoman corey carlson said the crew made the 
discoveries in a previously unexplored area about 60 miles east of 
west palm beach team leaders believe they may be closing in on the 
main cargo from the maravillas which sunk in 1656 after colliding 
with another vessel 
items from the ship have been found since 1985 but the recent 
discoveries are the most valuable 
weve been teased and teased for years she said it looks 
like we may finally hit the mother lode 
crew members speak in code on the radio and keep a small 
arsenal on board to guard against pirates she said 
weve seen boats anchored off the horizon and its kind of 
suspicious said ms carlson pirates still exist and you have 
to be very careful 
the treasures from the maravillas are stored in a vault in 
freeport bahamas 
the maravillas was carrying a cargo valued at 16 billion in 
current prices which could include artifacts such as a lifesize 
madonna and child of solid gold said beacon owner herbert 
humphreys jr of memphis tenn 
some of the artifacts will be auctioned off in london on oct 3 
he said 
the project is funded by humphreys company marine 
archaeological recovery of the cayman islands and maritime capital 
group headed by jim kollar and skeen 
the bahamian government receives 25 percent of profits made from 
sales of the maravillas artifacts

black patients wait an average of five months 
longer than whites for kidney transplants a newpaper investigation 
has found 
the federal government is investigating the disparity which 
stems partly from the fact that most donor organs come from whites 
the pittsburg press reported sunday because of slight racial 
differences in blood type and antigens donor organs are more 
likely to match those of the same race 
based on a review of 13888 kidney transplants nationwide in 
1988 and 1989 the newspaper found that black patients spent an 
average 14 months waiting for an organ on average white patients 
waited slightly less than nine months 
the study included only transplants using organs from braindead 
donors not living relatives whites accounted for 3144 of the 
3802 kidneys donated last year in the united states the newspaper 
said 
it cited data from the united network for organ sharing of 
richmond va which has a government contract to control the 
national organ procurement and transplantation network 
we are very concerned about this variance but we do and have 
always taken every possible safeguard to ensure that race never is 
an issue in the fair allocation of organs said dr james wolf 
unos president and director of the kidney transplant program at 
northwestern memorial hospital in chicago 
because most kidneys come from white donors characteristics of 
the white population appear more often in the donor pool 
the pattern of blood types and antigens varies slightly among 
races and hospitals always try to match donor to recipient as 
closely as possible to avoid rejection of a transplanted organ 
the newspaper said its study corresponds to preliminary data 
developed during an investigation by the us department of health 
and human services although the report is not expected to be 
released until december hhs secretary louis sullivan has referred 
to the findings in speeches this month 
sullivan said the government report will show blacks were 
waiting twice as long as whites and these differences remain 
even when blood type age immunological and locational factors are 
taken into account 
details of the hhs investigation are incomplete but it would 
call for a close inspection of the differences in waiting times 
that occur in the 230 hospitals doing kidney transplants 
nationwide said linda sheaffer director of the federal office of 
organ transplantation

international anxiety grew saturday over the fate of thousands 
of westerners barred from leaving iraq and occupied kuwait as iraq 
said it had begun moving some of them to strategic locations 
around the country 
thomas r pickering the us ambassador to the united nations 
said later saturday that iraqs actions make it clear that iraqi 
president saddam hussein is going to hold hostage all 
foreigners 
us officials had previously avoided using the word hostage 
to refer to the americans and other foreigners trapped in iraq and 
kuwait 
iraq said friday it was detaining citizens of aggressive 
countries and placing them in areas that would be likely targets 
in the event of a us attack 
on saturday iraq also said the foreigners would suffer any 
shortages along with iraqis it singled out children and the 
elderly saying they would endure hardship along with iraqis 
because of the embargo food cannot be secured for aged 
persons in the manner that we wish the statement said if 
there were to be any reduction in the necessities of babies then 
the same calamity affecting the iraqi newborn will affect similarly 
the foreign babies said an official statement read on iraqi 
television 
meanwhile the exodus of foreigers mostly arabs continued from 
kuwait and iraq at the jordanian border post of ruweishid 
officials reported that tens of thousands of arabs were fleeing 
into jordan from iraq and kuwait 
one official there said 8100 foreigners had crossed into jordan 
by saturday evening he said those who had crossed were all arab 
nationals mainly egyptians except for 425 poles and two indians 
with british passports 
officials said a record 22300 foreigners crossed the previous 
day this was the largest number since the exodus began following 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
the white house said iraqs holding american and other foreign 
citizens is totally unacceptable and denounced the use of 
innocent civilians as pawns in saddams stand against 
international sanctions 
anxiety grew following the overnight announcement by iraqs 
parliamentary speaker sadi mahdi saleh that foreigners from 
aggressive nations would be kept in iraq as long as the threat 
of war persisted mahdi said they would be housed in civilian and 
military institutions throughout iraq 
in an interview saturday with britains independent television 
news iraqi ambassador to france abdul razzak alhachimi said in 
paris some of them have been distributed in strategic 
installations in iraq starting all the way from north of iraq to 
the south 
the british foreign office said later it had confirmed that 40 
britons five americans four germans and one french citizen had 
been moved from kuwaiti hotels to undisclosed locations a 
department spokesman said iraq had said the foreigners would get 
vip treatment 
on saturday iraq also called the economic embargo imposed on it 
by the un security council an act of war and said the 
foreigners it holds will suffer along with iraqis if shortages of 
food and medicine develop 
iraq imports about threequarters of its food 
the baghdad government holds 3000 americans 4000 britons and 
about 14000 other westerners among the more than 2 million 
foreigners caught in iraq and kuwait when iraq invaded the small 
oil state 
the palestine liberation organization said saturday in tunisia 
that plo chief yasser arafat had received formal assurances 
that foreigners would be safe and well treated but it was not 
clear if that meant all foreigners or only palestinians nor was it 
clear who made the assurances 
britain called iraqs threat to detain westerners unlawful and 
inhuman and said it would not be deterred from helping defend 
persian gulf states against iraqi aggression 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said the iraqi ambassador was 
called in to underline our grave concern and to relay to his 
authorities the need for immediate clarification 
a west german foreign ministry spokesman said in bonn saturday 
his government felt great anxiety over the fate of 1000 west 
german citizens in iraq and kuwait after iraq said it would not let 
foreigners leave 
in paris france summoned the iraqi ambassador to warn that 
serious consequences would result if steps are not taken to 
protect the 560 french nationals in iraq and kuwait 
no orders were given for french people in kuwait to assemble at 
hotels as were given on thursday for americans and british a 
french source said 
the iraqi restrictions did not appear to refer to soviet 
citizens 
a group of 225 soviet citizens from kuwait were among the 
thousands who crossed into jordan on friday the group was driven 
straight from the border to ammans airport early saturday and 
boarded a plane that left for moscow 
italian newspapers said saturday that more than 300 italians in 
iraq say they are being held against their will and appealed for 
help from italy italys staterun tv reported saturday all the 
stranded italians appeared safe and were free to move about in 
baghdad and kuwait city 
many foreigners arabs and a few westerners were fleeing 
across the saudi border 
mohamed almashat iraqs ambassador in washington said in a 
cnn tv interview saturday that all foreign nationals were safe 
and welltreated 
i would protest the use of the term hostage he said in 
response to a question we call them our guests the lives of 
iraqis and foreigners are equal where is the humanitarian thing 
when you deny our children and babies the milk for their 
nourishment and livelihood 
he likened iraqs action to us internment of japanese 
descendants in world war ii it is a temporary measure because we 
are in a crisis

size of the army and purge officers accused of human rights abuses 
including the jesuit killings the rebels also have called for 
immediate un monitoring of human rights in the country 
the government has not yet responded to the rebel demand to give 
the united nations such authority government officials have said 
discussions on the size of the army and a purge of officers should 
come only after a ceasefire 
the 10year civil war has cost more than 72000 lives most of 
them civilian 
un mediator alvaro de soto told reporters in san jose that 
substantial progress could be made during the current round of 
talks but he said the united nations could not form a human rights 
verification commission immediately 
a series of practical problems exists for installing the un 
verification commission while the required conditions arent 
there we prefer not to do it de soto said without elaborating 
further 
the sixday round of talks are scheduled to run through 
wednesday 
in the letter addressed to cristiani the rebels proposed a 
joint governmentrebel commission to monitor legal proceedings in 
the jesuit murder case and report its findings to both peace 
negotiators and the public 
it said the fact the president acknowledged authorizing an army 
search of the priests house before the slayings implicated him in 
the killings 
cristiani has acknowledged authorizing the search of the 
priests home but said it was considered standard procedure the 
search took place three days before the killings and came during a 
major rebel offensive in san salvador 
the six jesuits their housekeeper and her daughter were 
murdered on nov 16 at the university of central america in san 
salvador nine military men including a colonel were charged in 
connection with the killings but none has come to trial 
the letter said an application to search the priests house 
reached cristiani at the moment that the radio and television 
network of your government said that father ignacio ellacuria 
should be eliminated 
it said the search authorization implicitly defined him and 
his jesuit companions as enemies to be eliminated 
the rebels charged that the governments sluggishness in 
prosecuting the accused officers is reaffirming and reinforcing 
the impunity of the armed forces 
the fmln letter accused the army of promoting and preventing 
prosecution of senior military officers implicated in the slayings 
accusations which have also been made by some members of the us 
congress 
the meetings which began friday at a san jose hotel were the 
fourth in a series aimed at ending the war 
the previous round last month also held in san jose led to a 
partial agreement on human rights it gives the united nations 
authority to monitor human rights in the country following a 
ceasefire

the times publishing co settled a 
stock feud with texas billionaire robert m bass that company 
officials said friday preserved independent control of the st 
petersburg times 
the publishing company agreed to recapitalization including 
redemption of its preferred stock the parties announced in a joint 
statement in return the bass group is dismissing its suit against 
the times 
the agreement assures the longterm independence journalistic 
control and competitive vigor of the st petersburg times as well 
as significant ongoing support for the poynter institute said 
andrew barnes chairman of times publishing 
david bonderman managing partner for the bass group 
poynterjamison ventures ltd said the settlement was in 
everyones best interest the partnership includes the nieces of 
the late eleanor poynter jamison sister of founder nelson poynter 
who ran the paper for 30 years 
we always believed this to be a good investment and are happy 
we could work with andy barnes to help end a family dispute that 
has brewed for years bonderman said 
earlier this year the bass group made a 270 million buyout 
offer for times publishing co parent firm of the newspaper 
congressional quarterly and other magazines 
the bass group owned 40 percent of the voting stock but got only 
57 percent of the dividends of times publishing co under an 
unusual stock arrangement 
the partnership sought a better return on its investment and 
maintained directors had an obligation to recall preferred stock 
as allowed by bylaws at 106 a share or 318000 
but the times defended the stock arrangement as beneficial to 
the journalistic standards of the newspaper and the health of the 
poynter institute which essentially controls the newspaper the 
institute offers education and national conferences to journalists 
and students 
as a result of the settlement the publishing company is 
incurring debt said barnes who is editor and president of the 
times the debt should not affect operations said barnes who also 
is chairman of the poynter institute and chief executive officer of 
the times holding co as well as times publishing 
nelson poynter who ran the paper for 30 years had set up a 
unique way to keep a profitable daily newspaper in the hands of 
journalists free from control of outsiders or even his family he 
established the notforprofit journalism school which ultimately 
is the major stockholder of the newspaper 
times publishing is owned largely by times holding co which in 
turn is owned almost entirely by the nonprofit poynter institute 
for media studies 
state attorney general bob butterworth had intervened in the 
suit on behalf of the poynter institute which he said was 
threatened by the bass partnership 
butterworth said he was pleased with the settlement but 
disturbed by the agreement by the parties not to comment on terms 
or related matters 
this office will take whatever steps are available to ensure 
that the state has sufficient information to determine that the 
settlement in fact does not have an adverse impact on the poynter 
institutes beneficiaries including the state university system 
and tampa bayarea public schools he said

top executives of nike inc said friday 
their chief competitor reebok international ltd was using 
operation push to try to gain an advantage in the hotly competitive 
athletic shoe market 
operation push a civil rights organization founded in chicago 
by jesse jackson called last saturday for a boycott of nike 
products push said it was dissatisfied with nikes record in 
hiring and doing business with blacks 
at a news conference nike chairman philip h knight and 
president richard k donahue said nike would hold no more meetings 
with push to discuss the subject 
push is being manipulated by reebok to the advantage of reebok 
and to the disadvantage of push donahue said 
knight said the boycott had not affected nikes business 
our dispute is not with the black community it is with 
push he said 
reebok executives did not return calls friday 
a woman at push headquarters in chicago answered the telephone 
with the admonition say no to nike two separate requests for 
comment were relayed to the executive offices but the calls were 
not returned friday 
nike based in the portland suburb beaverton made 243 million 
last year on sales of 22 billion reebok made 175 million on 
sales of 18 billion 
operation push says blacks comprise 30 percent of the market for 
nikes shoes and should got more jobs and business from the company 
in the past push has gotten signed covenants calling for 
greater opportunity for blacks from companies including coca cola 
and burger king 
the two executives said 21 percent of the nike employees hired 
in the united states since january have been minorities 
they refused to break down that figure to show the role blacks 
play at nike donahue said that would divert the public focus from 
nikes efforts to build a culturally diverse company 
i think it is wrong to target and focus on one segment of the 
minority community he said 
nikes goals include naming a minority to the board of directors 
within a year and a minority vice president within two years the 
executives said 
nike was the first sneaker company targeted because it is the 
biggest but donahue said reebok was excluded from pushs 
questionnaires to athletic shoe companies 
nike began providing information to push last month but abruptly 
stopped after finding that reebok had purchased an ad in a push 
magazine he said nike asked push for information on its 
relationship with reebok he said 
the response was outrage donahue said 
nike uses prominent blacks in its television advertising 
campaigns 
football and baseball star bo jackson basketball star david 
robinson and georgetown basketball coach john thompson are featured 
in a current series of nike ads urging young people to stay in 
school and stay away from drugs 
donahue said several nike stars including basketball player 
michael jordan had issued statements supporting nike in the face 
of the boycott 
a spokeswoman in new york for filmmaker spike lee who appears 
in nike ads said lee had no comment

salvadoran guerrillas entering a new 
round of peace talks with the government said friday they have a 
new plan to overcome differences over the future of the armed 
forces 
representatives of the salvadoran government and the farabundo 
marti national liberation front were to meet friday evening for the 
fourth round in a current series of talks aimed at ending el 
salvadors civil war 
we bring a new proposal which develops broadens and specifies 
what we presented earlier on the theme of the armed forces said 
schafik handal one of the rebel negotiators 
the subject of restructuring the armed forces will be the 
principal point of this meeting said rebel spokesman miguel 
saenz 
he said the front is demanding that the army disband its elite 
ustrained atlacatl battalion because it is one of those that 
have committed the most massacres of the people 
the battalion was the first salvadoran unit to be trained by the 
united states which supports the government and armed forces of 
president alfredo cristiani with about 1 million per day in aid 
rebels and government negotiators earlier agreed to try for a 
ceasefire in september but the government has balked at rebel 
proposals for trimming the armed forces and purging officers 
implicated in human rights abuses 
at least 72000 people most of them civilians have been killed 
in the 10yearold war between the leftist fmln guerrillas and the 
salvadoran military many of the victims were killed by rightwing 
death squads with ties to the military and cristianis arena party 
the third round of talks last month in san jose led to a partial 
pact on human rights and a separate agreement to let a united 
nations commission monitor human rights after a ceasefire 
the army currently has 54000 soldiers

while politicians loudly ask whos to blame 
for the savings and loan mess regulators and analysts are quietly 
asking a much more urgent question is commercial banking headed 
for disaster too 
the answer is yes said economist r dan brumbaugh of 
stanford university were already there 
he believes that more banks would be declared insolvent and 
the government fund protecting 26 trillion in deposits at 12500 
banks would be broke if regulators stopped using outmoded 
accounting methods to determine when a bank has failed 
no said l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp which through separate funds guarantees both 
bank and thrift deposits up to 100000 per account 
we will be able to handle any failures we can currently 
foresee he said he vigorously disputes brumbaughs methodology 
and conclusions 
but from another perspective the two sides are not far apart 
they are arguing about how bad the condition of the banking system 
is not whether it is in bad or good shape 
the bank insurance fund is in a very much stressed position 
seidman conceded at a recent senate hearing 
because bank deposits are nearly triple the 930 billion held by 
savings institutions the bank insurance funds health has always 
been potentially even more critical than the condition of the 
nowbankrupt federal savings and loan insurance corp 
the funds were established half a century ago to restore 
confidence in the nations financial system after a wave of bank 
and sampl failures swept the nation during the depression wiping out 
the savings of thousands of americans 
for decades both funds thrived supported by insurance premiums 
paid by member institutions but so many savings and loans failed 
during the 1980s that taxpayers had to rescue the sampl fund at a 
cost now estimated as high as 500 billion over 40 years 2000 
for every man woman and child in the nation 
the bank fund has so far been able to handle bank failures 
though the balance has been dropping for three years now and if it 
falls to zero in the 1990s taxpayers would have to bail out banks 
too 
the bank fund which ended 1987 with 183 billion lost 424 
billion in 1988 when bank failures hit a postdepression high of 
221 that was its first decline ever when another 207 banks failed 
last year it lost an additional 851 million 
failures remain high in 1990 121 through aug 16 and seidman 
has estimated the fund will lose around 2 billion reducing it to 
near 11 billion 
a key ratio measuring the funds health has been deteriorating 
even longer in 1963 the fdic had 150 for every 100 in 
deposits by 1981 that had gradually eroded to 124 as failures 
soared during the 1980s the ratio plummeted after this years 
loss seidman estimates it will be between 50 cents and 60 cents 
last week his board proposed emergency action to battle the 
decline preliminarily endorsing a 62percent increase in the 
insurance premium banks pay it is the maximum increase allowed by 
law 
the move would increase the fdics premium income from 28 
billion in 1990 to 48 billion in 1991 much of the added expense 
will be passed on to depositors through higher fees for checking 
accounts and other services 
analysts however say the added income would provide only a 
little extra protection for taxpayers should soaring oil prices 
trigger a recession and another wave of bank failures 
the wild card right now in all these forecasts is iraq said 
economist robert litan of the brookings institution a 
washingtonbased liberal think tank 
clearly right now the fund is skating on the edge it is 
conceivable that it could get by if the economy escapes a recession 
and if oil prices stabilize in the low to mid20s a barrel he 
said however iraq could change all that 
if the recession was deep bank troubles in the 1990s could 
dwarf those of the 1980s which occurred despite an unprecedented 
eight years of expansion in the national economy 
an additional worry is that bank regulators like sampl regulators 
before them would be tempted to allow insolvent banks to remain 
open then with federal insurance guaranteeing their deposits the 
banks would have every motive to take wild risks if they win they 
avoid bankruptcy if they lose taxpayers pay 
a few analysts like brumbaugh contend that is already 
happening 
the fdics behavior is deja vu all over again and it is 
irresponsible he said 
however others believe that with the lesson of the sampl mess 
still fresh bank regulators would appeal for taxpayer assistance 
much earlier and congress would respond more quickly 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
who made his reputation with early predictions of disaster for the 
savings and loan fund said comparisons between banks and sampls are 
overdone 
banks are fundamentally sounder institutions and 
basically the fdic has not been sweeping the problems under the 
rug to the extent that the thrift regulators were he said 
the root of the sampl crisis was planted when the institutions 
were created they borrowed deposits shortterm and lent the money 
longterm to home buyers when inflation pushed interest rates past 
20 percent they had to pay more interest on their deposits than 
they were earning on their mortgages 
cures applied in the early 80s expansion into new lending 
areas coupled with lax oversight only worsened the problem 
the roots of bankings woes are different but still formidable 
in the 1970s the nations largest banks had lent billions of 
dollars to third world countries who by the 1980s were defaulting 
by the mid80s small farm banks began collapsing along with 
agriculture commodity and farm land prices 
then came the drop in oil prices triggering a collapse in real 
estate values in the southwest now real estate problems have 
spread to the northeast and are threatening the southeast southern 
california and even a few midwestern cities 
longerterm innovations in the financial system are eroding 
banks profitability their best deposit customers have been lured 
to money market mutual funds their largest and most creditworthy 
borrowers raise money by issuing commercial paper a service that 
banks are substantially barred from delivering along with other 
securities underwriting 
banks defenders point out that the industry earned a record 
248 billion in 1988 and a respectable 157 billion in 1989 
critics however say that does little to reduce the potential for 
disaster 
although commercial banks collectively earned 62 billion in 
the first three months of this year 10 percent of them lost money 
and 1058 were considered problem institutions by the fdic 
ten percent can easily send you under deep under litan 
said the 10 percent of the banks that are unprofitable hold 
roughly the same assets that the open but insolvent thrifts held 
in the mid1980s we saw what they could do

in 1945 america had willpower 
at a cost of 400000 lives with grim determination it had 
waged global war for four years stopping only when germany and 
japan were vanquished 
in 1990 does america have willpower 
have 45 years of instant victories such as the dominican 
republic grenada and panama and long divisive wars that ended 
in stalemate or defeat korea and vietnam sapped the resolve of 
the united states to sustain a fight 
as saddam hussein gains stature as an american bogeyman and as 
the whole of saudi arabia becomes an american military base the 
questions no longer are rhetorical 
some historians and others suggest that american willpower is 
and always was conditional given a real reason to fight americans 
will fight they say given a vague purpose and mounting 
casualties they will carp 
militarily the us strategy has been to play for time the 
blockade of iraq aims to force saddam to withdraw from kuwait 
eventually the troops in saudi arabia await an iraqi invasion that 
may never come and if hostilities do break out no one expects a 
quick resolution iraq is not grenada 
no one knows whether americans have the will to support a 
lengthy costly war in the middle east over oil supplies 
i dont think theres any doubt that if theres a clear and 
present danger if theres a pearl harbor americans would fight a 
20year war if they had to said james reston retired columnist 
for the new york times 
the united states tends to remain at peace or to go to war 
wholeheartedly in a crusade said robert maddox a professor of 
history at the pennsylvania state university 
americans demand total victory they want that victory and 
then they want to go about their business he said they are no 
good at draggedout conflicts without any resolution no cities 
taken 
few american wars have been supported across the board during 
the american revolution tories fled to canada during the war of 
1812 several new england states threatened to secede abraham 
lincoln had to deal with copperheads as southern sympathizers were 
known in the north 
the spanishamerican war was short but the civil war that 
followed in the philippines dragged on spurring american protests 
led by mark twain 
even the american involvement in world war i which lasted just 
a year and a half inspired disapproval if only in retrospect 
by the 1930s there was a widespread belief among the american 
people that world war i was a mistake and we won that war said 
tom smith director of general social survey at the national 
opinion research center at the university of chicago 
the antiwar attitude fostered by reports of war profiteering 
and by the sense that the war accomplished nothing hindered 
franklin roosevelt as he tried to bring the united states into 
world war ii 
pearl harbor was an enormously unifying experience said 
john morton blum professor at yale and author of v was for 
victory a history of the homefront there was more unity than 
in any of the other wars 
still there are indications war support was not monolithic at 
least when the number of casualties escalated at the end of 1944 
more than 20 percent of those polled favored striking a deal with 
hitler 
and in its last year letters and articles were written decrying 
the cost of the war in the pacific where battles with the japanese 
on island after island exacted a heavy toll said richard lingeman 
author of the homefront history dont you know theres a war on 
people were screaming about it when they dropped the bomb 
there was some relief i think said lingeman 
in korea and vietnam too war support declined as casualties 
climbed 
john mueller a professor of political science at the university 
of rochester found that support dropped 15 percent when the number 
of casualties increased from 1000 to 10000 it dropped another 15 
percent when casualties climbed from 10000 to 100000 
the figures for the two wars were identical though one was 
conducted under the united nations flag and one was not though one 
was thoroughly televised a factor often blamed for opposition to 
the vietnam war and one was not 
any democracy is likely to face similar obstacles during 
wartime mueller suggested but an authoritarian regime like 
iraqs may be able quash that kind of opposition at least for a 
while 
what would inspire americans to accept casualties over the long 
haul 
another pearl harbor of course identifiable enemies help 
weve always needed a recognizable foe a kaiser bill who we 
were going to hang from the old apple tree a hitler said penn 
states maddox president bush has taken pains to compare iraq with 
the expansionist germany of the 1930s 
mostly americans need a clear and compelling reason 
sustained belligerancy with homefront morale is directly related 
to purpose said blum the world war ii historian 
thats what was lacking in vietnam said frances fitzgerald 
author of the vietnam history fire in the lake it had 
nothing to do with national willpower 
would a threat to oil inspire such dedication 
oil is vital were not talking about selling some bolts of 
calico cloth or cheap trinkets the kind of economic interests 
that sparked american shows of force in the 19th century said 
maddox 
still lingeman recalled that in the months before pearl harbor 
opponents of intervention said they would not go to war for rubber 
a vital commodity that was tied up in the conflict 
the idea of an economic war i dont think it will take i 
think people would make economic sacrifices before they would go 
to war he said 
reston agreed that barring further provocation american support 
for a war with iraq would wilt in the burning sun of the saudi

one of the strangest things about the socalled 
collapse of housing prices is that you cant detect it in some of 
the statistics its as if the numbers were added up incorrectly 
in the second quarter of the year for instance the median 
selling price of existing singlefamily houses was 34 percent 
above the figure for a year earlier in defiance you might say 
of the popular impression 
and a national association of realtors survey of existinghome 
sales revealed that secondquarter prices were higher than a year 
earlier in 70 of 98 metropolitan areas in some the price jumps 
were huge 
topping the list was the seattletacoma area where the 
secondquarter median price leaped 353 percent over the previous 
year honolulu where prices rose 332 percent and sacramento 
calif where the rise was 30 percent 
figures such as these prove again that many national averages 
and medians are hardly sound guides for measuring local markets 
unlike stocks and bonds where prices really are national real 
estate prices are strictly local 
what happens in portland ore where the median rose 158 
percent has little bearing on what happens in the 
middlesexsomersethunterdon nj area where the median price 
fell 95 percent steepest in the nation 
only one midwest metropolitan area recorded a decrease but four 
in the west 10 in the northeast and 11 in the south posted drops 
even within states there were differences new york fell 61 
percent albany rose 26 percent 
what the figures reveal clearly is that there indeed are regions 
of extreme price weakness but that these areas do not merge into a 
national collapse as so often is stated 
why therefore the sense among homeowners that the marketplace 
is a disaster 
for one thing excessively high hopes that led many sellers to 
overprice the inevitable price cut that followed might have left 
the price higher than a year earlier but the sense of money lost 
remains 
a lengthening of the time it takes to sell a house contributes 
to the feeling of a down market in some areas of the northeast the 
median selling time is close to 300 days vs a few weeks just four 
years ago 
adding to the feeling of a dead market is the more critical 
attitude of buyers they are more selective more patient more 
inclined to negotiate than to buy immediately and of course 
lenders are tighter than ever 
for those sellers who can bide their time the selling delay is 
hardly the disaster it is for those who must sell these are the 
sales that provide the anecdotal evidence of a market collapse 
they are not easily forgotten 
in many communities for example real estate agents advertise 
that they sold houses within a week after listing the suggestion 
being that they provided the seller with an extra measure of 
marketplace expertise 
query them and you find that the seller urgently required a 
quick sale and that the listing agent priced the house well below 
market patient buyers learn a lot about pricing and often act 
quickly when they spot a steal 
no amount of statistical evidence is likely to dispel the notion 
that there has been a national housing price collapse too many 
people have indeed been hurt financially and millions of others 
are unnerved on hearing about them 
but so far the national housing disaster you hear so much about 
has happened more in the mind than in the numbers

chicagos giant commodity exchanges are readying their 
longdelayed japanese financial futures products for a september 
launch but they concede they have no hope of becoming the world 
leaders in those markets 
that distinction belongs to and will continue to belong to two 
japanese stock exchanges that have been trading futures on the 
nikkei 225 and topix stock indexes for nearly two years and on 
japanese government bonds for even longer 
the chicago exchanges say they will settle for being secondary 
markets it is a role to which they are not accustomed but which 
will nevertheless reinforce their presence in the global financial 
marketplace 
with a nikkei 225 contract available for trading in north 
america investors in the japanese stock market will have a means 
of protection after their regular trading day ends said john 
geldermann chairman of the mercs board of governors 
on sept 25 the merc will launch its nikkei 225 futures and 
futuresoptions contracts followed two days later by the board of 
trades introduction of futures and futuresoptions on the topix 
stock index and japanese government bonds 
the contracts will give investors mainly large institutional 
investors more places in which to essentially buy insurance 
against losses on japanese stocks and bonds 
the chicago markets are not likely to generate as much volume as 
their japanese counterparts though because they will be open for 
trading mainly during the us business day which is nighttime in 
japan 
spokesman michael oconnell said the board of trade also will 
list its japanese products for trading during the exchanges 
2hour evening session which corresponds to the opening of the 
japanese trading day 
futures on the nikkei 225 japans version of the dow jones 
industrial average are traded on the osaka securities exchange 
the topix is an index based on all 1100 stocks listed on the 
tokyo stock exchange the worlds largest the tokyo exchange 
trades topix futures and japanese government bond futures 
the futures are contracts to buy or sell stocks and bonds at 
some future date at a price agreed upon in advance investors can 
use the contracts to offset their risk in the underlying cash 
markets or speculate on market movements 
strategists at the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange began designing the new products at least five 
years ago at a time when japanese laws forbade financial futures 
trading on japanese exchanges 
the chicago exchanges hoped to capitalize on the situation by 
creating their own riskmanagement tools for japanese investors as 
well as for others who invest in the japanese financial markets 
the potential rewards were enormous as the chicago exchanges 
already had proven with the remarkable success of their us 
government bond and stockindex futures 
those products transformed the merc and board of trade from 
sleepy agricultural commodity markets to worldclass financial 
exchanges 
the chicago exchanges won us regulatory approval for the 
contracts in 1988 at about the same time that the japanese 
government relaxed restrictions on such products at home 
the result was that the chicago exchanges helped the japanese 
develop their own markets for financial futures in exchange for the 
rights to trade those same contracts in the united states 
oconnell said the board of trade considers it important to 
offer the contracts even though the exchange has no expectation of 
overtaking the japanese markets in trading volume 
with the marketplace becoming so international in scope it 
behooves us to compete on the international scene he said 
oconnell said the exchange also plans to introduce futures on 
various european government bonds

the persian gulf crisis has combined with 
alarming us economic statistics to make even some upbeat 
forecasters tilt their outlooks toward the gloomy side 
many now believe the federal reserve faces an ever more 
treacherous minefield in charting a course for us interest rates 
over the next several months 
the key worry is that evidence disclosed this past week on 
consumer prices construction and trade depict an economy leaning 
dangerously toward both recession and higher inflation even before 
the usiraq faceoff in the gulf which has sent crude oil prices 
skyward 
i think the statistics still point to slow growth and the 
consumer price statistic suggested inflation hasnt been 
contained said marilyn schaja economist at donaldson lufkin 
and jenrette securities corp in new york it suggests there was 
some kind of preiraq problem 
the most troubling figure came from the labor department which 
said consumer prices rose 04 percent in july when oil prices were 
falling 
economists said this means when the full impact of rising oil 
prices is felt in august and beyond inflation could surge toward 
an annualized rate of 7 percent or more for 1990 
that would be the worst in nine years and underscore the growing 
us addiction to foreign oil which now accounts for half the 
countrys consumption of 17 million barrels a day 
oil is in every product and the price will be reflected in 
every single good said james chessen deputy director of policy 
development at the american bankers association in washington 
well see a significant rise im pretty worried about that 
one of the federal reserves principal jobs is to restrain 
inflation through its influence over interest rates pushing them 
up when inflation rises and easing when the economy slows 
before the july inflation numbers were revealed it was widely 
assumed that the federal open market committee the feds 
policymaking arm would take subtle steps to depress interest rates 
at a regular meeting this coming week but now many economists say 
they dont believe that will happen for a while 
further complicating the picture is the heavy debt burden the 
economy is carrying easing interest rates would only add to the 
toll being exacted by the budget deficit the savings amp loan 
bailout bankruptcies and high levels of corporate debt 
i think the fed is in an odd position now chessen said 
they dont want to move aggressively to counter the inflationary 
effects of the mideast yet they worry what it means in the long 
term if they dont 
another worrisome statistic of the week was a 26 percent 
decline in housing starts for july reported by the commerce 
department the sixth straight monthly decline in an industry that 
many economists say is clearly in a recession and needs a dose of 
lower interest rates to revive 
the commerce department also reported the trade deficit for june 
dropped to a sevenyear low because of record exports in other 
times that might have been good news but instead was seen as an 
aberration 
economists said the trade report didnt reflect the subsequently 
higher price of oil which is likely to swell the us import bill 
and discourage some foreign countries from buying us goods 
these trade numbers were computed when oil was 1415 a 
barrel said gary ciminero chief economist of fleet financial 
group a providence ribased banking company add at least 10 
to that and figure it out 
not all economists viewed the higher price of oil with a sense 
of foreboding some argued that when priced in 1990 dollars oil 
still remains far below the levels of 10 years ago even if oil 
remains in the 2530 range they said oil is only one element of 
the inflation picture 
others say comparisons to previous oilprice shocks of the 70s 
are flawed and misleading because other forces were at work in 
those times such as sharply higher wages and a rapidly expanding 
money supply which were pushing inflation up relentlessly 
we used to have an economy with a lot of builtin price 
pressures spirals in all sorts of things said thomas f 
carpenter of asb capital management in washington those things 
are absent all areas are soft 
still carpenter said oils rise will permeate the economy with 
higher prices you cant get around it

wall streets obsession with news from the 
middle east has displaced corporate reports and other traditional 
signposts of the stock markets direction sending prices plunging 
as optimism wanes 
the dow jones industrial average has fallen 254 points since 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and stood at 264480 by friday the 
conflict ended talk of the dow average breaking 3000 this year 
some analysts dont expect the price slide to stop anytime soon 
generally trends tend to go farther than you think they will 
go said ac moore research director at argus research corp 
the new york investment house believes the dow average will 
touch 2550 or even lower before the iraqi situation stabilizes 
robert l kahan manager of equity trading at montgomery 
securities inc in san francisco said he believes stock prices 
will keep dropping until something definitive happens in the 
mideast 
the market does not like uncertainty he said 
but not all market watchers are so pessimistic 
michael metz a managing director of oppenheimer amp co said he 
believes the dow average will only drop 20 or 40 points more before 
the market enters a recovery 
i would be amazed if the market would close below 2600 this 
year he said its always the case when everybody says this 
market is going a lot lower and cant possibly go up thats 
usually the time its hitting the bottom 
charles clough chief investment strategist at merrill lynch amp 
co wouldnt speculate how much farther stock prices may fall but 
said he believes the market is oversold 
youve taken an awful lot out i would say youve got to rally 
at some point here he said youre probably awfully close to 
the end of panic selling 
at that point he said bargain hunters should begin to enter 
the market sending stock prices higher 
clough said the mideast standoff did not set off the stock 
markets slide instead it only exploited soft market conditions 
that already existed the economic trouble was evident in 
disappointing secondquarter corporate earnings released last 
month he said 
moore said the markets turmoil reflects an underlying 
uncertainty about the world 
were realizing we dont have a great deal of control over the 
future as we seemingly did in the past with the move toward 
democracy and free markets he said 
moore said hes never seen the market more sensitive to world 
events in the 20 years he has worked on wall street 
there is lingering optimism in the market that the iraqi 
stalemate will be resolved peacefully but that optimism is 
starting to fade he said 
in addition he said youre starting to see more and more 
people talk about a probable recession 
should an allout war erupt in the mideast analysts envision 
different scenarios for the market 
kahan predicted a war would send the dow climbing because it 
finally would be evidence of some definitive action in the region 
metz said a war would spark a shortterm nervous selloff and 
then the market would go up 
clough said a conflict would send oil prices even higher as 
supply concerns mounted further destabilizing the market wars 
have never been good for financial markets he said 
the mideast upheaval erased 7178 points from the dow this week 
a drop of 26 percent 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 396 to 18019 
for the week the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter 
market lost 1454 to 39349 and the american stock exchange market 
value index fell 771 to 33161 
volume on the big board averaged 14795 million shares a day 
down from 18129 million the week before
