the president of dartmouth college on 
monday accused the review a conservative offcampus weekly 
newspaper of poisoning the intellectual environment of our 
campus 
what the review has done on this campus has not been decent 
what it has done has been irresponsible meanspirited cruel and 
ugly president james freedman said at a faculty meeting 
he called staff members of the independent newspaper 
ideological provocateurs posing as journalists 
chris whitman editor of the review did not immediately return 
a message for comment 
the review has been at the center of controversy since it was 
founded in 1980 
it has been attacked as antiminority antiwomen and 
antihomosexual and has been championed by such conservatives as 
william f buckley jr and former white house communications chief 
patrick buchanan 
freedmans public criticism of the review the strongest to date 
by any highranking dartmouth official came weeks after three 
review staffers were suspended and a fourth was put on probation 
for their role in an angry confrontation with a black professor 
described by the review as incompetent 
the college also announced monday that dean edward shanahan had 
denied the students request for reconsideration of their cases 
in addtion review staffers in 1986 were involved in a nighttime 
sledgehammer attack on symbolic antiapartheid shanties on the 
college green 
freedman who left the university of iowa to become president of 
the ivy league school eight months ago said it is time for me 
to speak out because i now see that the review is dangerously 
affecting in fact poisoning the intellectual environment of 
our campus 
the college freedman added must not stand by silently when a 
newspaper maliciously engages in bullying tactics that seem 
virtually designed to have the effect of discouraging women and 
members of minority groups from joining our faculty or enrolling as 
students 
the college charged that the review has referred to homosexuals 
as fairies and written that some negroes prefer being 
slaves 
freedman disputed claims that the review is under attack because 
it is politically conservative and he insisted that issues posed 
by the review have nothing whatsoever to do with freedom of 
expression 
he said that the review represents a perversely provocative 
style of journalism that vulgarizes responsible conservative 
thought and is in fact an affront to it

passengers apparently panicked at the sight of 
flames on the wing of a northwest airlines jet and evacuated the 
plane without waiting for instructions from the crew officials 
said monday 
the plane did not actually catch fire sunday night but the 
incident closed detroit metropolitan airport for 20 minutes and 
four passengers were hurt sliding down the emergency chutes 
authorities said 
i think the unfortunate thing here is that the passengers in 
confusion initiated the escape exit without being ordered to do so 
by the captain faa administrator t allan mcartor said and of 
course wed like to see that the captain be able to call the shots 
in this regard 
the plane was carrying 144 passengers and seven crew members 
from san diego calif 
it appears at this time that it was a spontaneous evacuation 
by passengers at the time of the flash said northwest william 
wren 
wren described the fire as a flash caused by residual fuel it 
occurred in the right wing and probably lasted only a second or 
less he said the plane returned to service monday he added 
such a flareup is not unheard of and its not as dangerous as 
one might think if handled properly said mcartor who happened 
to be in detroit on monday for a speech 
wren said northwest had not interviewed crew members but that 
the passengers rather than the crew apparentlty initiated the 
evacuation 
that needs to be the call of the captain mcartor said we 
simply would like the crew to be able to initiate that sequence of 
events 
naturally we would like to find out more about this he said 
faa spokesman mort edelstein said the pilot was alerted about 
the flareup and triggered an automatic device that extinguished the 
flash 
a 64yearold woman whose name was not released was listed in 
good condition monday at william beaumont hospital in royal oak 
suffering from trauma and knee and elbow injuries 
the other injured passengers were treated at another hospital 
for cuts and bruises and released 
passenger mike young of toledo said he popped open an emergency 
exit as panic spread through the plane and he and his wife climbed 
onto the wing 
we thought about jumping but when the flames died down we 
thought it might be too dangerous young said 
other passengers said flight attendants jumped up to help with 
the evacuation they helped calm everyone down carolyn 
reinhardt of marlton nj told the news of detroit

a northwest airlines jet was evacuated 
sunday night when residual fuel vapors briefly ignited causing 
what witnesses thought to be a fire authorities said 
four passengers were injured slightly while evacuating the 
boeing 727 jetliner shortly after it landed at 820 pm and the 
incident forced the airport to close for about 20 minutes 
according to northwest and airport spokesmen 
flight 288 originating in san diego calif with 144 
passengers and seven crew members aboard landed routinely at 
metropolitan airport northwest spokesman william wren said 
residual fuel in the exhaust system of the auxiliary power 
unit produced a flash that caused evacuation of the aircraft as the 
aircraft awaited clearance to taxi to the terminal wren said in 
a prepared statement 
the flash was sighted at the planes right wing where the 
residual fuel is exhausted wren said 
mort edelstein a spokesman for the federal aviation 
administration in chicago said the flash was sighted by a 
controller in the airport tower passengers aboard flight 288 and 
by people aboard another plane taxiing behind the northwest 
aircraft 
the pilot of flight 288 was alerted and triggered an automatic 
device that extinguished the flash edelstein said by that time 
he said the plane had been evacuated and airport firefighters were 
summoned 
but edelstein said by the time the fire department got 
there there was no visible evidence of a fire an initial faa 
examination of the plane revealed no burned parts or other signs of 
an actual fire he said 
the auxiliary power unit runs the aircrafts electrical air 
conditioning and other systems while it is on the ground and 
operates separately from the engines wren said 
the four injured passengers were treated at annapolis hospital 
mainly for cuts and bruises suffered while sliding down evacuation 
chutes nursing supervisor barbara morrow said

lawmakers from areas where japanese imports 
threaten to cut into jobs are coming down with a case of the 
bluecollar blues over changes they say will water down their 
sweeping trade bill 
i dont see why we should be pulling all the teeth out of our 
bill out of fear of a presidential veto says rep donald j 
pease dohio 
the concerns are surfacing as a housesenate conference 
committee prepares to meet tuesday to begin thrashing out what 
lawmakers are calling the cosmic issues still remaining in the 
debate such as retaliation against foreign trade barriers 
the conference committee is seeking to reach a compromise 
between rival house and senate versions of the 1000page trade 
bill a massive attempt to solve a massive problem record us 
trade deficits and related layoffs in some us industries 
president reagans repeated veto threats are raising anxieties 
on capitol hill and may have prompted efforts by senate conferees 
to tone down the measure in hope of winning administration support 
some of the most stringent provisions such as democratic 
presidential hopeful richard a gephardts plan for retaliation if 
japanese trade surpluses dont fall 10 percent per year have long 
been opposed by the administration 
reagan says they could lead to counterattacks on american farm 
goods and other exports cost more jobs than they would save and 
hurt consumers by narrowing the choice of goods on the shelf and 
raising prices 
some lawmakers from the nations hardhit heavy industrial belt 
however say senate attempts to minimize reagans objections could 
throw away the best of a threeyear effort to produce tough trade 
legislation 
the conference on the trade bill is like a diet coke when you 
take away the sugar and you take away the caffeine and all you have 
left is the bubbles says rep frank guarini dnj a house 
conferee 
i think the president and his people are not fools says 
pease also a conferee they know that trade deficits are very 
large they know that trade is a political issue this year so i 
think the president is likely to sign a trade bill that we send him 
this year he may grumble but hell sign it 
guarini points to a plan he devised under which the government 
would step up monitoring to find out what foreign companies are 
dumping products in the us market at prices slashed below 
those charged to consumers at home the practice is illegal under 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
both house and senate versions of the bill contained a 
monitoring provision but the latest senate proposal would wipe 
them both out 
thats a strange way to compromise says guarini 
pease is smarting from a senate move to strike provisions 
designed to expand the definition of unfair trade practices by 
including such issues as foreign companies and governments denial 
of collective bargaining rights to their industrial workers 
pease is especially concerned that the senate proposal would 
wipe out some causes of retaliatory action already appearing in 
us trade law among them denial of market access to american 
companies 
other house conferees grumbling over the possibility of diluting 
the bill include reps marty russo dill and ed jenkins dga 
the latter an outspoken champion of the hardhit textile industry 
senate finance committee members who drew up the proposals are 
understandably impatient with these complaints 
were trying to write a bill thats in the 20th century 
says sen max baucus dmont we dont want a petrified bill 
stuck in the past 
itemizing every possible unfair trade practice merely runs the 
risk of leaving something out and then having it used against 
american companies baucus says the problem of repeat dumping 
offenders is taken care of by other provisions of the bill he adds 
over the last few weeks house and senate conferees have not 
been meeting face to face but instead communicating through 
messages sent back and forth between the two wings of the capitol 
the meeting tuesday will be the first inperson confrontation 
and because of the friction between the two sides it almost 
certainly will take place behind closed doors 
were getting down to the cosmic issues rep william 
frenzel rminn told reporters we have to do that face to 
face

jesse jacksons win in michigan has sent a 
message to the democratic party that it can no longer ignore at 
the rate hes going jackson just might wind up as its presidential 
nominee this fall 
political analysts say jacksons almost 21 victory over 
erstwhile frontrunner michael dukakis in saturdays michigan 
caucuses is a clear signal that the preacherturnedpolitician is a 
very viable contender for the nomination 
jackson treated as an alsoran in 1984 has won in eight states 
so far this year michigan alabama georgia louisiana 
mississippi virginia south carolina alaska and in puerto 
ricos nonbinding contest 
the string of victories is forcing the party to reexamine the 
theory that a black cannot be nominated for president in 1988 
the democratic voters are sending a very strong message to the 
party said ann lewis a democratic strategist and informal 
adviser to the jackson campaign the quality of leadership is 
something they like and admire this is a referendum on him and a 
referendum hes winning 
the campaignwatchers also said the michigan win could translate 
into victories in other highstakes contests including the new 
york primary on april 19 
i dont believe dukakis can stop him said david garth a 
new york media consultant who is working for tennessee sen albert 
gore jrs campaign unless something different happens 
new york which has 255 delegates at stake represents a serious 
challenge for dukakis who has failed in the major industrial 
states of illinois and michigan 
the stakes could not be more critical said paul maslin 
pollster for illinois sen paul simons campaign he cant just 
finish second to jesse jackson he cant say im the leading white 
candidate its not going to work this year 
dukakis has got to win big to even say this is the guy the 
party wants garth said 
a new york daily news poll published sunday showed dukakis 
favored by 45 percent of the 528 democrats surveyed to 29 percent 
for jackson the poll conducted between monday march 21 and 
thursday march 24 had a margin for error of plus or minus 45 
percentage points 
however new york gov mario cuomo has said that if two or three 
candidates are left in the democratic race prior to the primary 
jackson has a chance of winning 
a poll by the marist college institute for public opinion found 
that 57 percent of 459 democratic voters surveyed in new york 
earlier this month gave jackson a favorable rating to 30 percent 
unfavorable in a survey by the same group in january only 44 
percent had given jackson a favorable rating while 41 percent rated 
him unfavorably 
new york is a fairly volatile state garth said he noted 
thatg the state has a large jewish vote a group that has been 
skeptical of jackson in the past 
in the most recent marist college survey 36 percent of the 
jewish voters gave jackson a favorable rating an increase from 17 
percent in january fortythree percent gave jackson an unfavorable 
rating compared to 62 percent in january the results had a margin 
of error of 5 percentage points 
the numbers suggest jackson is mending fences with jews whom he 
offended in 1984 
there are still some in the political establishment who think 
1988 is an inevitable replay of 1984 ms lewis said but she 
added the day after michigan a new world has dawned

one aspect of supreme court justice anthony m 
kennedys past that senate investigators apparently missed was his 
high school absenteeism 
kennedy who joined the court feb 18 confessed while 
discussing his childhood in sacramento calif during a recent 
interview with the courts docket sheet publication 
my dad was a lawyer a great lawyer and i wanted to follow 
him the justice said he was a sole practitioner and he used 
to take me with him to hear him try his cases he didnt think 
school was very important he would take me 
even in high school hed say we have to go now were going 
for two weeks for a trial i would just leave school because he 
would insist that i go with him i probably saw 10 trials before i 
was ever out of high school i loved it 
no word in yet on kennedys truancy as a stanford undergraduate 
or as a harvard law student 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
efforts by the television networks to provide live coverage of 
the ceremony in which kennedy became the 104th justice in the 
courts history failed 
despite allowing greater access to cameras in various public 
portions of the court building and granting more oncamera 
interviews from their chambers than in past years the justices 
apparently have drawn the line at the courtroom door 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the court last week cited a lack of a quorum in refusing to kill 
a lawsuit stemming from an armed confrontation between indians and 
federal agents at wounded knee sd 
four justices including kennedy disqualified themselves from 
the case and the remaining five justices automatically upheld a 
lower court ruling that clears the way for a trial in which former 
federal and military officials are named as defendants 
three members chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor had disqualified 
themselves when the case was granted review before kennedy joined 
the court his disqualification came as something of a surprise 
his office informed reporters that as a rule kennedy will not 
explain such actions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
during a recent questionandanswer session with george 
washington university law students justice scalia proved a popular 
guest despite his reluctance to give substantive replies to several 
queries 
asked why supreme court justices seem more hesitant to talk 
about substantive issues than lower court judges scalia said 
justices are more likely to be quoted in the news media thus 
causing controversy

maintains an office in the supreme courts stately building on 
capitol hill 
so does retired chief justice warren e burger 
but a littlenoticed bill introduced in december by sen patrick 
moynihan dny would change that 
the proposed legislation authorizes construction of a new 
judiciary building at the foot of capitol hill on land currently 
used as a parking lot for senate employees 
the building would house the administrative office of the us 
courts the federal judicial center the judicial panel on

the attack ads of super tuesday have given 
way to a gentler spring but experts say the most pointed jabs of 
the presidential primary season will be back this fall with a new 
twist 
history tells us that were likely going to see democrats 
being quoted against the democratic nominee and republicans quoted 
against the republican nominee both in advertising and in 
speeches says kathleen hall jamieson author of two books on 
political campaigns and advertising its a classic move and this 
year both sides are vulnerable 
the outbreak of tough television talk started in new hampshire 
when sen paul simon questioned rep richard gephardts consistency 
and vice president george bush dubbed senate gop leader bob dole 
senator straddle 
the negativity was contagious by super tuesday on march 8 
almost all of the candidates had been both victims and perpetrators 
of attack ads by their intraparty rivals their determination to 
survive the 20 contests that day stronger than any longterm 
concerns about the fall 
when the others keep attacking you and its going to cost 
votes theres no choice but to fire back and worry about the 
consequences at a later date says dan payne a media adviser to 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
some people are lucky bushs offhand remark in 1980 about 
ronald reagans voodoo economics didnt keep him off the ticket 
and didnt keep the ticket from winning 
but jamieson said that was because jimmy carter didnt use the 
remark effectively it could have been much more damaging than it 
was but the democrats didnt take advantage of it she said 
preconvention squabbles have played a significant role in 
several recent elections lyndon johnson richard nixon and ronald 
reagan won in 1964 1972 and 1980 at least partly because they 
reminded voters of what had been said about their opponents in 
contested primaries 
in 1964 jamieson said johnson reiterated the charges that 
george romney nelson rockefeller and william scranton had made 
against barry goldwater in 1972 nixons most effective ads 
against george mcgovern simply repeated the attacks hubert 
humphrey made against mcgovern she said 
and in 1980 jamieson said one reagan campaign ad showed sen 
edward kennedy chanting something to the effect of no more high 
interest rates no more high inflation no more jimmy carter 
its an attractive strategy because it minimizes any backlash 
against the nominee he can quote what others have said without 
going on the attack himself remaining in more of what author 
stephen hess calls the presidential mode 
once nominated they want to be perceived more as statesmen 
than as politicians and its less attractive to them to be in the 
mudslinging business said hess a senior fellow at the brookings 
institution and author of a book called the presidential 
campaign 
thus nominee bush if he felt so inclined could undermine 
dukakis by citing gephardts attacks on him as a taxraiser and a 
city guy who thinks destitute farmers can get rich growing belgian 
endive 
the democrats for their part have a wealth of material against 
bush much of it compliments of dole and rep jack kemp of new 
york kemp went after the vice president on taxes and social 
security while dole ads questioned bushs leadership ability and 
his judgment in the irancontra affair 
the same issues also came up in debates the democrats will have 
access to scenes of bushs pugnacious rivals demanding explanations 
of his irancontra role and how he has distinguished himself in the 
past seven years 
any frontrunner right now that isnt collecting tapes of the 
debates is foolish theyre a gold mine said jamieson 
the ammunition provided by primary opponents can be especially 
useful in drawing disaffected voters who had supported someone 
other than their party nominee its a powerful reminder of 
what they initially disliked about the nominee and a strong 
inducement to cross party lines in the general election jamieson 
said 
theres no guarantee these tactics will work if both sides 
point to what opponents said in a primary the effect may be a 
wash if the nominees borrow too liberally from the remarks of 
others voters may end up confused by the cross fire 
and then there are the tests of time and relevance by the 
conventions this summer will voters remember the dukakis 
campaigns 1987 attack video against sen joseph biden will 
they care about the gephardt ad accusing dukakis of smearing biden 
political analysts say its unlikely the highwater mark of 
negative advertising was probably reached on super tuesday and no 
one they say has come up with anything as potentially damaging as 
voodoo economics or wheres the beef walter mondales 1984 
question of gary hart 
if its not worse than voodoo economics it probably doesnt 
hurt said democratic consultant bob squier 
squier and others pointed to the developing irancontra 
situation as a bigger headache for bush than anything the democrats 
have said about each other thus far 
and while it will be nice for the democrats to be able to quote 
dole squier said they wont have to be nearly as circumspect 
dole had to make his attack on a sitting vice president but he 
had to shoot around the president he said we democrats wont 
have that problem

sen paul simon said all he expected in 
michigans democratic presidential caucuses was a respectable 
showing 
he got 2 percent but aides put the best face on even that 
they said the results while far from what simon wanted made 
his strategy of expending little effort in michigan and focusing on 
the wisconsin primary more important than ever 
simon was saying after michigan what hes been saying for weeks 
now that the democratic race is so muddled that hes got as much 
right as anyone to hang in there 
were clearly headed toward a wideopen convention simon 
said 
jesse jacksons victory over massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
in michigan increased simons attractiveness as an alternative 
said chris sautter the illinois senators wisconsin campaign 
coordinator 
now were in a position where we can be considered a serious 
contender here sautter said sunday it underscores the whole 
idea of an open convention 
simon acknowledges though that wisconsins primary a week 
from tuesday is a key test 
in a state like wisconsin where politics is synonymous with 
the word progressive we have the opportunity to communicate that 
the democrats dont have to settle for a weak alternative 
campaign spokesman terry michael said we need to make that case 
in wisconsin 
what happens if simon loses 
we have to reassess at that point michael said 
even longtime supporters said simon must win in wisconsin or 
think seriously about abandoning his quest for the white house 
the big questions are whether his campaign after wisconsin is 
credible and raising money said rep richard durbin dill if 
the answer to those two things is yes hell be pressing 
forward 
simons only victory so far was at home in the illinois primary 
he has placed third fourth or fifth in most other primaries and 
caucuses sat out super tuesday races in 20 states and ranks fifth 
among five candidates in delegates to the democratic national 
convention in july 
hes by no means out of it and im sticking with him as long 
as he wants to stay in said rep lane evans dill voicing 
sentiments of aides speaking for reps marcy kaptur dohio and 
stephen solarz dny 
yet evans hedged when asked if he thinks simon still has a 
chance of becoming the democratic nominee 
its very hard to say whats going to happen evans said 
strange things happen occasionally at conventions 
other allies though said they have counseled simon against 
hurting his chances for reelection to the senate by clinging to a 
hopeless cause 
i think he will continue to look at it as long as he doesnt 
incur more debt said sen alan dixon dill one of those who 
urged simon to bypass the super tuesday states 
you dont want to have a big debt when youre looking at 
1990 dixon said i cant tell you what his present financial 
shape is but its hoped he can walk away from this thing pretty 
much as a wash 
simon has repaid more than a halfmillion dollars worth of bank 
loans and he expects to use 20 staff members and spend 100000 for 
television advertising in the wisconsin campaign spokesman michael 
said

california is in a broccoli race with other 
parts of the country where farmers seek crops more profitable than 
the traditional harvests of wheat corn cotton and soybeans 
an agriculture department report by roberta cook of the 
university of california davis says cauliflower has joined 
broccoli as a favorite among the veggie expansionists 
between 1978 and 1986 harvested acreage of broccoli increased 
by 90 percent while the number of states producing for the fresh 
market grew from the traditional four california texas oregon 
and arizona to include new producers such as maine north and 
south carolina new york illinois virginia oklahoma and 
colorado she said 
the expansion is explained by the rapidly growing popularity of 
fresh vegetables in the american diet and by the declining 
profitability of food and feed grains in the 1980s 
unfortunately the capacity of the fruit and vegetable 
industry to absorb the additional acreage is limited ms cook 
said 
that is because there are more than 200 million acres in the 
united states used to produce grain compared with only about 5 
million acres of fruit and vegetables 
consequently while shifting 25 percent of grain acreage into 
fruits and vegetables would not solve the excess supply problem in 
grains it would double fruit and vegetable acreage and devastate 
prices she said at the same time other regions of the world 
particularly mexico and the caribbean basin initiative countries 
are expanding vegetable exports to the united states 
california remains the dominant broccoli producer with its area 
increasing to 106400 acres in 1986 from 64400 in 1978 however 
californias share of the total us broccoli acreage declined from 
a high of 96 percent in 1979 to 82 percent in 1986 
the california market share of broccoli production also dropped 
during the 197886 period from 96 percent to 91 percent 
there has also been a rise in cauliflower production with the 
harvested area rising 65 percent between 1978 and 1986 ms cook 
said fresh market cauliflower production increased even more to 
more than 59 million hundredweight in 1986 from 185 million in 
1978 
californias market share of fresh market cauliflower increased 
to 79 percent of the total in 1986 from 74 percent in 1978 
although california has a climatic advantage during portions of 
the year the competition in other states during the summer and 
fall has become significant 
the combined fall broccoli area in the midwest south and east 
amounts to an estimated 10000 acres compared with 28000 acres in 
california ms cook said hence this new broccoli acreage 
compares to 35 percent of california acreage when viewed on a 
seasonal basis 
meanwhile imports of fresh vegetables have increased sharply 
since 1978 despite the growth however she said broccoli imports 
still represent only about 1 percent of the total us supply 
while cauliflower imports make up about 2 percent of the supply 
mexico is the leading source of fresh broccoli imports and 
canada is the largest provider of imported cauliflower 
however both canadas and mexicos share of the import market 
has declined slightly while other exporting countries including 
guatemala jamaica chile belgium france and israel have 
gained ms cook said

a fouryear experiment to control houseflies 
with tiny parastic wasps and special traps is near an end perhaps 
paving the way for use by consumers generally says the agriculture 
department 
richard miller of the departments agricultural research service 
said the traps were used last year by a laurel md resident paul 
schwartz whose home is next to a horse farm flies bred in manure 
and straw bedding were a problem it was impossible to eat outside 
because of the flies 
last summer the experimental traps reduced the flies by an 
estimated 90 percent schwartz said 
miller whose work was reported recently by the agency said 
houseflies can be major irritants in areas where many new houses 
are being built near farms and theyre a nuisance to farmers and 
livestock too 
the trap is painted white to attract the flies and a sticky 
coating nabs them once they land miller said that while there is 
interest in the pyramid traps none is yet being produced 
commercially 
miller said the tiny wasp muscidifurax raptor is a biological 
control alternative to chemical sprays the wasps are found 
throughout the united states and are natural enemies of the flies 
while being harmless to humans the wasps lay eggs in the fly 
pupae which are killed as the wasps develop 
these parasites are reared by the thousands and released to 
maintain or augment natural wasp populations miller said in 
last years test we increased the wasp populations up to tenfold 
later he said traps were used to capture the surviving flies

the national research council is out to prove 
the chinese proverb give a man a fish and you feed him once 
teach him how to fish and you feed him for life 
the council has seized on the idea an oftquoted aphorism in 
foreign aid circles and come up with a lot of ideas from 
pedalpower fishing craft more efficient than rowboats to 
artificial mangrove branches made of aluminum wire bathed in 
concrete the fake branches provide the kind of surface that baby 
oysters like to hang on useful in places where cutting mangroves 
is illegal 
the council has recently published a booklength manual of 
lowprice fishing methods called fishing technologies for 
developing countries its not for big commercial fleets but for 
traditional fishermen who account for a quarter of the worlds 
catch about 20 million tons a year they provide most of the fish 
in africa and asia but a much smaller proportion in latin america 
an estimated 200 million people depend on them 
first thing most fishermen need is a boat the high quality 
hardwoods many peoples traditionally use have become dearer and 
harder to find plywood is not too expensive and plywood 
catamarans developed in western samoa have lasted almost a decade 
plastic tubes and ferroconcrete are ugly but cheap and durable 
the japanese have found another use for sixinch plastic tubes 
two of them 30 inches long are laid side by side with a twoinch 
concrete plug that bisects them the result offers four fatal dens 
to unsuspecting octopi 
in venezuela they make octopus pots from old rubber tires 
a boat has to move sailing has declined among third world 
fishermen in recent years the council says and instead there have 
been ideas for cheap fuel alcohol made from cassava manioc in 
fiji coconut oil for mixing with diesel fuel in the philippines 
the coconut oil clogged the fuel filters and the filipinos have 
been trying to use charcoal from coconut shells to make gas for 
fuel 
several ideas some more effective have come from the 
philippines the academy says a system for cultured mussels 
developed at sapian bay on the island of panay uses ropewebs 
floated from rafts instead of the more usual stakes driven into the 
mud it raised mussel production to more than five times the old 
method 
advanced technology need not be too expensive the council 
points out fish are sensitive to the temperature of the water and 
move when it changes a shift of one degree or even less can 
indicate a place where fish may cluster ordinary thermometers are 
not sensitive enough but a simple electronic thermometer can show 
differences of a tenth of a degree and cost less than 100

the federal reserve has been trying to keep 
the economic recovery alive following the october stock market 
collapse but many economists believe it is starting to worry more 
about rising inflationary pressures 
these analysts think the switch will mean that interest rates 
including mortgage rates will not fall further and actually will 
climb slightly in coming months 
the central banks top policy makers will meet behind closed 
doors tuesday to review monetary strategy the decisions made by 
the federal open market committee will not be revealed until 
midmay 
while analysts are not looking for major policy changes to come 
out of the meeting they said recent comments by federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan indicate that the central bank has begun to 
worry once again about inflationary pressures 
the central bank tries to balance the competing economic goals 
of supplying enough money to the financial system to keep the 
economy expanding while guarding against supplying so much money 
that inflation is rekindled 
in congressional testimony earlier this month greenspan said he 
was worried that inflationary bottlenecks could develop in us 
industries later this year 
greenspan said there were no signs of inflationary troubles at 
present but that the central bank would act fast at the first sign 
that the economy was overheating for the fed fighting inflation 
means raising interest rates 
before the oct 19 collapse of stock prices the fed had been 
tightening credit conditions out of fear that a weaker dollar would 
increase us inflation 
but following the record 508point drop in stock prices the 
central bank moved quickly to ease credit in order to keep the 
country out of a recession 
analysts said they believed greenspans recent comments were an 
indication the central bank is once again switching gears 
i am not looking for any more interest rate declines i think 
the fed is worried again about inflation said david seiders 
chief economist of the national association of home builders 
mortgage rates which hit a high of 1158 percent immediately 
before the stock crash last october dipped into singledigits 
earlier this year falling to 984 percent in early february 
but in recent weeks rates have been rising again averaging 999 
percent last week according to a nationwide survey by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp 
seiders predicted that mortgage rates could top 11 percent by 
the end of the year other analysts agreed that a variety of 
interest rates would likely head higher in coming months 
especially if economic growth rebounds 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said he 
believed the central bank would make no outright change in policy 
at its march meeting but would stand ready to tighten credit 
conditions later in the year 
if the economy picks up steam and produces inflationary 
pressures i wouldnt rule out a tightening move later this 
spring he said the central bank is making people aware that 
if inflation does heat up they would tighten 
lyle gramley chief economist for the mortgage bankers 
association said he expected mortgage rates to fluctuate between 
10 percent to 105 percent over the next two months as the fed 
watches for further indications of how the economy is performing 
one key indicator the fed will be watching is the monthly 
unemployment report the jobless rate dropped to an 8year low of 
57 percent in february and greenspan indicated that it was 
unlikely the rate could fall much farther without triggering 
inflationary pressures 
if economic growth is too strong the unemployment rate could 
drop down into a danger zone which would generate an upturn in wage 
increases said gramley a former member of the fed board once 
you get that under way it is very hard to stop and even harder to 
reverse that is what you want to avoid if you can 
some economists said that the fed would hold off making any 
major change in direction until late next month when the government 
releases its first estimate of overall economic growth as measured 
by the gross national product for the januarymarch quarter 
roger brinner an economist with data resources inc said that 
if growth was really weak in the first quarter the fed might be 
persuaded that a further dose of easing was needed especially 
since this is a presidential election year

houston has suffered low oil prices a troubled 
space program and the nearexodus of its pro football team now it 
wants to avoid another hit the departure of superstar 
superconductivity physicist paul chu 
i think we need to be sure we dont drop the ball says city 
councilman jim greenwood its probably more important to keep 
paul chu as it was to keep the houston oilers 
superconductivity the potential of some materials to carry 
electricity without energy loss has become one of the hottest 
areas in science today and chu a 47yearold university of 
houston physics professor has become one of the hottest 
researchers in superconductivity 
the research promises to spawn tremendous advances in industry 
with applications in computers transmission of electricity and 
transportation although many observers feel it will be decades 
before any significant commercial products result 
early last year chu announced that his experiments with 
materials showed evidence of superconductivity at temperatures 
warmer than ever before achieved the discovery brought 
energysaving practical applications within closer range 
the news spread quickly and made chu an overnight celebrity in 
scientific circles job offers began rolling in one university has 
promised him a 20 million research package if he moves there said 
chu who isnt naming the school 
the rumors have prompted houston businessman tom wright to 
organize a letterwriting campaign asking small business owners to 
urge chu to stay 
we should go out of our way to make sure he likes it here 
wright said wherever major discoveries are made industry grows 
around it in my mind superconductivity will be bigger to this 
area than nasa ever was 
chu says he has made no decision but is considering an offer 
from the university of californiaberkeley on march 6 the san 
francisco examiner reported chu had accepted a teaching and 
research post there and berkeley officials continue to claim chu 
has taken the job 
we are expecting him to come to berkeley this fall said 
geoffrey chew berkeleys dean of physical sciences he came here 
last week and confirmed that he had accepted the offer 
in recent weeks chu has not responded to numerous interview 
requests through his secretary mike albert he says he remains 
undecided 
paul has been agonizing over this decision for about a year 
now roy weinstein dean of the university of houston college of 
natural sciences and mathematics said last week 
among the attractions of berkeley for chu are the universitys 
prestige the favorable california weather and the closer proximity 
to family members who live in california weinstein said 
since his major discovery chu has been appointed to the newly 
created tll temple chair at the university of houston funded by 
a 15 million endowment his salary has been raised and he has 
been named director of the texas center of superconductivity at 
university of houston a 30 million research unit to be built at 
the university 
i think that the superconductivity center is more important to 
him than anything else said university of houston president 
richard van horn we have perhaps more people working in 
superconductivity than anywhere else 
houstons relatively undiversified energybased economy was hit 
hard by the 1986 fall of oil prices and operations of the nations 
space program and the nearby johnson space center here came to a 
virtual halt with the explosion of the space shuttle challenger 
the citys confidence was further battered last year by the near 
departure of the houston oilers to jacksonville fla the team 
eventually signed a 10year lease to remain in houston 
weinstein says he believes chu will split his time between 
california and houston but says the strain of such an arrangement 
may be difficult for the quiet researcher 
its a question of whether he can do it weinstein said 
he will have to confront it test it and see

house speaker jim wright is pledging to work 
with the republican leadership to produce a humanitarian aid 
package for the contra rebels saying the amount of money involved 
isnt a serious stumbling block 
together well work it out the speaker said of his planned 
negotiations with house gop leader bob michel rill 
todays talks come in the wake of the preliminary ceasefire 
agreement last week between the contras and the sandinista 
government of nicaragua which allows the rebels to remain armed 
and in the field while entering political talks with the government 
earlier this year house democrats beat back president reagans 
request for a package of weapons and ammunition for the contras 
saying it would interfere with the peace process then republicans 
sided with a few democratic opponents of any contra aid to defeat 
the house leaderships alternative plan for 30 million in strictly 
humanitarian assistance food clothing and the like 
as a result us aid to the rebels ended feb 29 wright is 
still supporting humanitarian aid and this time he wants to ensure 
gop backing for the proposal 
the speaker whose highprofile role in the central american 
peace process has upset some administration officials declined in 
an interview sunday on nbctvs meet the press to specify the 
amount of humanitarian aid he envisions 
i have one but im going to be amenable enough to listen to 
bob michel and others i dont think the dollar figure is a serious 
stumbling block he said 
the speaker did not express any opposition to a provision in the 
package guaranteeing a speedy vote on military aid if the peace 
process breaks down but he said triggering such a vote should be a 
collaborative decision by both congress and the white house 
last week wright said the aid package should include food 
clothing and medical assistance for the contras also last week 
michel said he had discussed a 48 million oneyear aid package 
that provided an expedited vote on further aid in june 
wright reminded of congress refusal to send military aid to 
the rebels was asked if the soviets should be required to end 
their support to the nicaraguan government 
i think its high time that we do sit down with the soviet 
union and hammer that out wright said i dont know any good 
reason why we shouldnt be doing that 
wright was asked if he believed the nicaraguan government should 
be allowed to receive whatever foreign assistance it deems 
fit in its own interest in light of the regional peace accord 
that bars funds from foreign sources seeking to overthrow a 
government 
i dont see anything wrong with their getting humanitarian 
assistance or economic assistance god knows they need all the help 
they can get from every source with the state their economy is 
in the speaker said 
but i think it has to come to a point where there is a 
cessation of military weapons and now thats up to the reagan 
administration to sit down and negotiate that 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega appearing on cbstvs face 
the nation repeated his call for direct negotiations with the 
united states 
were ready to talk with the united states ortega said 
but assistant secretary of state elliott abrams appearing on 
the same program rejected the idea of direct talks with nicaragua 
we dont need bilateral talks with the sandinistas abrams 
said 
he expressed skepticism that the nicaraguan government will hold 
to the agreement signed with the contras saying weve heard 
those promises before 
abrams said congress had forced the agreement on the rebels 
saying congress had just smashed them into a corner with the 
cutoff of military aid 
contra leader adolfo calero also appearing on the nbc program 
said he believed he should be included in the wrightmichel 
discussions 
i feel that we should be invited by speaker wright to go to 
washington and participate he said

filing for personal bankruptcy was 
embarrassing says famed heart surgeon dr denton cooley but 
it was the only solution for his financial troubles 
the 67yearold pioneer heart surgeons career has been a 
success story he was the first to implant an artificial heart and 
the first american to perform a heart transplant operation among 
his 70000 openheart surgeries 
but defeat entered cooleys life on jan 4 when he filed under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law his many real estate 
investments in houston victimized by a depressed oil economy 
i think this is the first professional defeat that has come 
to me he told the houston post in sundays editions it was 
embarrassing theres sort of an indignity that goes with it 
but ive always felt like i was a real competitor i have 
participated in all sorts of sports and athletics in the past and 
one of the things you learn on the playing field is how to take 
defeat as well as victory 
cooley founder of the texas heart institute in houston said 
hes one of the few people to file a reorganization plan at the 
same time as a request for bankruptcy protection that move will 
allow him to emerge from bankruptcy as early as april he says 
i want to carry on with my life he said

michael dukakis was late for the final rally of 
his michigan caucus campaign but his staff was still scrambling to 
fill a halfempty hall in the polish enclave of hamtramck 
at the same time miles away in flint 40 people were turned 
away from the overflowing church where jesse jackson was speaking 
so they gathered around a television stations truck to watch 
jackson on the monitors 
campaign events are an uncertain barometer of election success 
but in michigan the developments on friday were an excellent 
forecaster of the results on saturday 
dukakis had a difficult day a schedule snarled by logistical 
problems and a sometimes testy response from some spectators 
in contrast jackson was drawing substantial enthusiastic 
crowds as he motored across the state 
and on saturday that enthusiasm turned into votes that gave 
jackson an overwhelming victory crushing dukakis by nearly 21 in 
the big industrial state 
i think the major factor was the level of intensity of jackson 
supporters and the lack of intensity of other supporters 
michigan house speaker gary owen said 
owen said he found an overwhelming lack of enthusiasm for 
everybody but jackson owen supports tennessee sen albert gore jr 
as expected jackson swept the black vote by margins of up to 
151 but he did well in others parts of the state with small 
minority populations winning 10 of the states 18 congressional 
districts 
jackson knows well the dubious reliability of rallies and town 
meetings as indicators of political success he drew big crowds in 
1984 and still finished third in the democratic presidential race 
that year 
but in michigan this time the indicators were right on the 
money 
in some sense its a lot of poetry jackson said in 
milwaukee late saturday its a lot of history we also have the 
numbers and its a lot of reality 
at the hamtramck event the audience was no longer so small as 
to be embarrassing when dukakis arrived with detroit mayor coleman 
young sen don riegle and others but at least a quarter of the 
crowd was made up of reporters and plainclothes policemen 
earlier that day in detroit two plainclothes policemen stopped 
a reporter and asked why a crowd had gathered down the street told 
that jesse jackson was speaking the two parked and went inside 
the union hall to listen 
crowds generally waited patiently for jackson to appear but in 
comstock park the grumbling was evident when dukakis arrived about 
half an hour late due to logistical problems that wiped out many of 
his planned events 
make them wait we did yelled one older man as dukakis cut 
short his town meeting in the grand rapids suburb to hold a news 
conference and rush to a fundraiser 
speak english this is america said another as dukakis 
spoke in greek and spanish with those in the uaw hall who addressed 
him in those languages 
jackson worked this state hard even delaying his departure from 
the state on saturday to motorcade and walk through mostly black 
neighborhoods encouraging his supporters to turn out 
dukakis spent less time in the state he flew in monday night 
for a quick visit held a pair of news conferences wednesday night 
and then muddled through the day friday 
part of the difference in schedules came from dukakis 
commitment to return to boston to work as governor part from 
dukakis greater attention to fundraising and part from campaign 
judgments about allocating candidates time among the various 
states 
and when dukakis was in the state he found himself explaining 
over and over again that he had not flipflopped on the trade 
issue that his backing for a trade bill by sen don riegle of 
michigan was not just a political ploy rep richard gephardt 
grabbed the front pages by pounding away at dukakis on trade 
it didnt help gephardt he finished a dismal third but the 
blows kept dukakis on the defensive 
the messages from the two candidates were also substantively 
different dukakis talked of competence and compassion as his 
televisions ads emphasized balancing budgets and creating jobs 
jackson hit over and over again at his theme of hope for those 
who are down who are jobless who are out of luck 
in a state where the auto industry has put thousands out of 
work jacksons more optimistic message was the stronger one as 
dukakis came close to admitting saturday night in defeat 
the people of michigan have been through a very difficult 
time there is great unhappiness great concern great uncertainty 
there are laidoff workers workers today who have jobs are worried 
they are going to be next dukakis said jesse has strong 
feelings about that as i do 
dukakis relied on an impressive organization in michigan as he 
has in other states plus endorsements from young and riegle 
jackson had a good organization himself in michigan and spent 
about 90000 on paid media but he couldnt resist a swipe at 
dukakis 
it was the message of the soul and authenticity of jesse 
jackson versus money and technology and the people prevailed 
jackson told supporters sunday at westchester county airport in new 
york 
everybody won something in detroit jackson said when the 
votes were counted dukakis won mayor youngs endorsement i won 
the peoples votes

michael dukakis gained and jesse jackson 
received a smaller boost as iowa democrats went through the latest 
step in their lengthy process of choosing democratic national 
convention delegates 
richard gephardt whose hopes had surged with a victory in last 
months iowa precinct caucuses faltered in the latest test 
following poor showings in other states 
it confirms whats going on nationally said bonnie 
campbell iowa democratic chairwoman 
party activists over the weekend held county caucuses where they 
elected delegates to congressional district conventions in may and 
the state convention next summer at those meetings they will elect 
52 of the states 58 delegates to the democratic national 
convention in atlanta the state has six super delegates party 
leaders who automatically are delegates 
with 97 of the states 99 counties reporting results of their 
conventions dukakis had 287 percent of the delegates to 
gephardts 279 percent illinois sen paul simon was third with 
264 percent based on a strong showing in counties along the 
border of his home state 
jackson pulled in 131 percent of the delegates improving on 
his performance in last months precinct caucuses while 39 
percent remained uncommitted 
in last months precinct caucuses gephardt got 31 percent 
simon 27 percent dukakis 22 percent and jackson 9 percent 
dukakis backers had been quietly lobbying supporters of other 
candidates to switch and unite behind a frontrunner 
im telling our people to treat everyone like you would your 
next date said jerry crawford a dukakis organizer but for 
some people it isnt time to get engaged yet 
the dukakis forces targeted backers of former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt who has dropped from the race and succeeded in picking up 
support 
it looks like those people who defected dukakis picked up the 
lions share said ms campbell jackson picked up a few 
party activists said gephardt was damaged by his poor 
performance in saturdays michigan caucuses 
as word filtered out of gephardts thirdplace michigan showing 
some of his backers apparently decided not to make the effort to 
attend county conventions many of which ran until the wee hours 
sunday morning

jesse jackson said he was looking at the votes 
not the color of the voters in his landslide victory over michael 
dukakis in the states presidential caucuses 
jacksons commanding 55 percent of the vote far outstripped the 
states black population which according to the 1980 census is 13 
percent 
as usual jackson galvanized the black community which 
responded with a highly organized getoutthevote effort for 
saturdays caucuses 
that provided him with a solid core of support but he didnt 
stop there campaigning in connecticut on sunday jackson said his 
first concern is to count the votes not the color 
its a campaign of growth a campaign of hope he said 
mary holmes deputy state coordinator for the jackson campaign 
said what feels so good is that its a clearcut victory its 
all ours you want to talk about the popular vote we won that you 
want to talk about the majority of delegates we won that too 
holmes said the keys to the jackson victory were the campaigns 
plan to turn out the vote for the caucuses and jackson himself 
its the effect he has on people who hear him she said 
her comments were echoed by michigan house speaker gary owen 
who said the major factor was the level of intensity of jackson 
supporters and the lack of intensity of other supporters 
owen who supports tennessee sen albert gore jr said sunday 
that he had campaigned several days and found an overwhelming 
lack of enthusiasm for any of the candidates except jackson 
i know there was excitement in seeing a presidential candidate 
and hearing a presidential candidate but i never felt that degree 
of intensity among the crowds for those other candidates he said 
that intensity was reflected in the vote totals where jackson 
buried dukakis with 107689 votes or 55 percent to dukakis 55337 
or 28 percent missouri rep richard gephardt came in third with 
24995 or 13 percent illinois sen paul simon had 4069 or 2 
percent and gore had 3818 or 2 percent 
those totals represented 94 percent of the vote counted the 
state democratic party said it would release final figures sometime 
today 
the delegate projections from those results showed jackson with 
74 of the states 138 committed delegates dukakis with 50 
gephardt 11 and uncommitted 3 
michigan also will send 12 uncommitted super delegates to 
the july convention in atlanta they are gov james blanchard and 
the 11 members of the democratic national committee 
jackson particularly swamped dukakis in the predominantly black 
1st and 13th congressional districts which cover detroit in the 
1st jackson had 25416 compared with 1809 for dukakis while in 
the 13th he had 17725 to dukakiss 1539 
however if those figures are subtracted from the two 
candidates totals jackson still comes out ahead 64548 to 51989 
state rep alma stallworth a democrat from detroit said she 
thinks those figures represent a lot of young people and new 
voters who got involved for the first time 
stallworth said the highly organized jackson campaign also got a 
boost from black churches which urged people to vote 
but she pointed out that jackson also did well in mostly white 
districts covering the western southern and eastern lower 
peninsula 
state rep ilona varga who supports jackson said he carried 
her district which is only 26 percent black by attracting white 
voters 
i think it says something about our people i think it says 
something about our country she said 
he was saying what people wanted to hear said state sen 
david holmes ddetroit it all boils down to breadandbutter 
issues regardless of race color or creed he outworked outtalked 
and outcampaigned the other candidates in all 18 congressional 
districts 
zolton ferency a former state democratic party chairman said 
organized labor leaders liked gephardts tough trade stand but 
his campaign was dying they didnt want to back a loser 
dukakis on the other hand wasnt wellknown in michigan and 
had to introduce himself to the states democrats and then try to 
get them to vote for him ferency said 
dukakis he added wasnt the kind of candidate that can 
generate instant enthusiasm

maneka gandhis goals include saving the 
bears monkeys donkeys dogs frogs crocodiles and she hopes 
the country 
the 31yearold writer former model and once and probably 
future candidate for parliament is the estranged sisterinlaw of 
prime minister rajiv gandhi shes also the daughterinlaw of the 
late prime minister indira gandhi and the widow of sanjay gandhi 
who was groomed to become prime minister but died in a crash while 
stuntflying a small plane 
the political game is familiar if not always comfortable turf 
for maneka 
so is a front lawn filled with 14 tailthumping tonguelolling 
puppies and dogs 13 of them rescued from the streets of new delhi 
and waiting for maneka to find homes for them the 14th is a 
permanent resident manekas pedigreed bull mastiff sabra 
in midmarch maneka disbanded her own small political party and 
joined forces with the janata party one of the largest of indias 
many opposition groups she declared anew her determination to see 
rajiv ousted calling him an ineffective leader and his congress 
party corrupt 
within a week newspapers were speculating maneka would run 
against her brotherinlaw in the next parliamentary elections 
scheduled to take place by early 1990 
whether i stand for office is something that will be decided 
in a year or two maneka says 
i really think quite frankly that the time for little parties 
is past we have a huge upsurge of opinion against the government 
but because we are all separate none of it has come into the 
mainstream opposition its gone to the lunatic fringe she said 
during an interview in the onestory house where she lives with her 
7yearold son feroze 
in the meantime she is continuing her animal protection 
campaigns and describes her political outlook as similar to that of 
the environmentoriented greens parties of western europe 
every time i do animal work i lose votes im in politics 
thats my main philosophy i just dont believe you can isolate one 
form of service from the other she said 
speaking with the intensity and speed of a machine gun burst in 
britishaccented english that is the hallmark of economically 
comfortable welleducated indians maneka launched into precise 
examples 
we are killing 21 million frogs a year in india for standard 
experiments in our school laboratories if i run a savethefrogs 
campaign its not because one of them is going to turn into a 
prince in my hand its because the small farmer needs them 
without frogs to eat the insects in his fields he has to buy 
pesticides which will probably give him cancer so its really a 
political decision not an animal decision the campaign for the 
saving of the frogs 
as a young bride maneka filled the role of adoring wife and 
daughterinlaw but after sanjay was killed in 1980 maneka grew 
apart outspokenly apart from his ironwilled mother prime 
minister indira gandhi 
indira in the meantime had plucked sanjays older brother 
rajiv out of his pilots job with indian airlines and put him in 
the cockpit to succeed her in what is sometimes wryly referred to 
as the worlds only democratically elected dynasty 
in 1982 maneka was pitched out of indiras house with her son 
two dogs and a heap of suitcases 
she started her own party the rashtriya sanjay manch dedicated 
to perpetuating what it called the populist ideas of her dead 
husband 
when indira gandhi was assassinated in 1984 rajiv became prime 
minister two months later he successfully defended his parliament 
seat in new elections swamping a field of challengers 
one of them was maneka 
her party faded into the shadows but her energetic espousal of 
causes didnt much of it was channeled to the sanjay gandhi animal 
care center on the outskirts of the capital 
the red sandstone clinic staffed by two veterinarians and 11 
helpers is refuge for sick and injured animals brought by their 
owners or found in the streets 
or dumped at manekas house in this way she has acquired at 
least temporarily hundreds of dogs the occasional bullock a 
peacock with a tumor and a white donkey with one eye sightlessly 
opaque and an oozing hole where the other had been 
i went out to dinner and came back about 1130 and found it 
tied to the gate blinded bloody maneka said 
the donkey went to the animal center it will probably stay 
there indefinitely like lakshmi a oneeyed chestnut mare who 
arrived nearly seven years ago the horses right hind leg extends 
foward at an improbable but permanent angle the result of violent 
dislocation 
lakshmi named for a hindu goddess is one of manekas 
favorites shes my first thats why we call her lakshmi it 
means luck maneka said as she led a tour of the clinic and 
grounds where 41 dogs were ensconced 
she also serves as a freelance consultant for wildlife 
sanctuaries throughout india counseling warmer water for 
crocodiles penned in icy himalayan waters trying to figure out why 
some monkeys at bangalore arent breeding and how to end the 
plight of the dancing bears 
there are 10000 bears in india who have been kidnapped from 
the himalayas she said they have their teeth pulled out 
their nails pulled out theyre made to dance their average 
lifespan is 42 years but they die at 3 
she has heard about a man who wants to donate land for an animal 
sanctuary so maybe its going to fit in with my bears maybe we 
can use zoos as halfway houses get the railroads to transport 
them rehabilitate the bear handlers some can work in the 
sanctuary line up businessmen to give the others jobs 
in between politics and animal care she writes a biweekly pet 
column for newspapers has just completed a book on the origins of 
indian names and has promised two more one of fairy tales the 
other on the plants of india 
the book of names she said was the kind of job i dont have 
any business undertaking like most of the things i do but if you 
wait for people so i just sort of begin every time i start 
something its always sort of off the beaten track

reagan in his traditional gridiron response poked fun at vice 
president george bush and bushs fellow republican presidential 
candidate pat robertson as well as rich republicans 
before i refuse to take questions reagan said i have an 
opening statement i thought nancys performance was absolutely 
wonderful raisa top that 
reagan later said if robertson becomes president thered be 
no more hail to the chief it would be when the saints go 
marching in 
referring to the fact that bush was born in massachusetts has 
family connections in connecticut has been active in politics in 
texas and spends time in maine reagan said bush could win if he 
carries his own states

broke windows and smashed the front door of the iraqi embassy in an 
angry demonstration against chemical weapons attacks that killed 
more than 5000 kurds last week 
but local police said no one was arrested in sundays incident 
a supreme court ruling last week knocked down a rule that had 
kept all demonstrations including peaceful ones at least 500 feet 
away from foreign embassies however the court still allowed 
police to disperse groups congregating near embassies when they 
reasonably believe that a threat to the security or peace of the 
embassy is present 
iran has said iraq used internationally banned poison gas bombs 
in a march 20 air raid that killed 5000 kurdish villagers a 
leader of kurdish rebels in the area of northeastern iraq occupied 
by iran said at least 50 other kurds were killed and scores wounded

unidentified nerve gases in the attacks to prevent the people 
from joining iranian combatants

a judges decision to reunite two 
girls with their father three years after they watched him strangle 
their mother has touched off a new custody fight and public outrage 
against the judge 
i guess the bottom line is whether or not its ok to kill your 
wife in front of your children says gene tranel of eldridge 
iowa brother of the 26yearold victim carol lutgen 
tranel who took in his nieces tracy 11 and dana 10 while 
james lutgen served a 20month prison term is fighting to get them 
back 
but lutgens lawyer william schirger says the case has been 
blown out of proportion in this small mississippi river town 
the kids are not in any danger jim loves the girls and they 
love him they asked the judge to let them live with him 
schirger said 
lutgen 33 pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for the 
dec 21 1984 death of his wife at the family home in tiny 
menominee in the northwest corner of illinois 
two original murder counts against lutgen were reduced after the 
court ruled his daughters were too young to testify as witnesses to 
their mothers death 
the lutgens were on the verge of a breakup as the 1984 holiday 
season approached she didnt love jim no more recalled 
lutgens mother grace they were separating the day after 
christmas he was broken up about it 
the couples fatal battle was fueled by lutgens belief that his 
wife was seeing another man his mother said although the fight 
was sparked by a disagreement over whether to take the girls 
shopping and skating 
as the girls looked on verbal attack became physical 
confrontation 
i picked the girls up afterward and they told me they had 
seen part of the fight mrs lutgen said they said they were 
pushing and grabbing each other around the neck 
lutgen was released from prison in october 1986 and regained 
custody of his daughters last dec 29 
the jo daviess county judge who made the custody decision eric 
demar of galena has borne the brunt of the public outcry since 
lutgen regained his daughters 
demar has been attacked by mail over the telephone and in 
newspaper articles and editorials 
a judge cant always make a popular decision and that 
certainly is the truth in this case he said 
the law and the facts in the case left me no choice he 
added noting that the us supreme court has placed a high 
priority on parental rights in custody cases 
lutgen a cement finisher in the construction business has not 
responded to requests for comment but his mother says she believes 
there is no risk to the girls 
i check on them several times a week id never let anything 
happen to them they love their dad she said 
lutgen has continued to have family troubles his mother said he 
and the girls moved out of her house to one of his two brothers 
homes after an argument with her last month 
meanwhile tranel has fought lutgens request for custody of the 
girls he filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his former 
brotherinlaw and is appealing demars custody decision 
it seems to me to be so basically morally wrong for the 
children to go back to their parent in a case like this said 
tranel who has visitation rights 
is that person a fit and proper parent tranel asked how 
can you get your children back and go on like nothing happened 
schirger countered that lutgens criminal conviction did not 
strip him of his parental rights and he has not been proved an 
unfit parent

if vice president george bush becomes 
the republican partys candidate for the presidency he will have 
the support of pat robertson 
robertson a former television evangelist and current gop 
hopeful also said over the weekend that if bush is elected he 
most likely would not challenge him in 1992 if bush opted for a 
second term 
it will all depend on what george bush does as president 
robertson said in a news conference following a rally of his 
supporters basically i would support the republican president 
that would not be a wise thing to go against the president of 
your own party 
but until the national convention robertson said he is 
concentrating on his own campaign a campaign he admits no longer 
is aimed at the white house but at the future 
and if he is to survive robertson told his supporters he must 
win his home states upcoming caucuses 
robertson placed third earlier this month behind bush and kansas 
sen bob dole in virginias nonbinding primary he also was third 
in his hometown of virginia beach

recommended that swaggart undergo two years of rehabilitation and 
be suspended from his baton rouge la pulpit for three months 
but the executive presbytery 13 men who serve as a national 
board of directors for the church asked the state district to 
reconsider what some called an unprecedentedly lenient response to 
a ministers moral lapse 
after gathering again on feb 29 in a ninehour session the 
louisiana presbytery stood by its original decision the general 
presbytery whose members include representatives from each of the 
churchs state districts has been charged with resolving the 
conflict 
reports circulated that swaggart would leave the assemblies of 
god if church officials suspended him from his pulpit for longer 
than three months but a spokesman for swaggarts ministry said he 
has made no decision on how he might react to the national 
councils decision 
mrs turnage said she did not believe the general presbytery 
would be swayed by rumors heard through the media 
church officials refused to comment on a newspaper report that a 
compromise proposal has been offered that would bar swaggart from 
preaching for one year but would order him to give public 
testimony about his sin 
the 10page proposal obtained sunday night by the springfield 
newsleader was worked out by cliff jackson a little rock ark 
lawyer and church member who said the plan has been endorsed by 
both swaggart and louisiana church leaders 
swaggart who addressed his congregation briefly in baton rouge 
on sunday as he has done several times since formally relinquishing 
the pulpit is not expected to appear at todays meeting mrs 
turnage said 
in response to reporters shouted questions as he drove from the 
service swaggart said he wasnt planning to leave the ministry 
adding why should i 
the general presbytery is a court of last resort on ministerial 
credentials a minister usually appeals to it after his course of 
rehabilitation has been set by the executive presbytery and a state 
council the executive presbytery shortcircuited that process when 
it decided march 3 to turn the swaggart case over to the larger 
body 
the louisiana presbytery has close ties to swaggarts jimmy 
swaggart world ministries a televisionchurchschool complex based 
in baton rouge that broadcasts swaggarts fiery sermons to several 
countries louisiana superintendent cecil janway for example sits 
on swaggarts board 
jimmy swaggart world ministries took in an estimated 150 
million in 1986 donations have fallen off since swaggarts 
confession forcing the ministry to lay off about 100 people and 
suspend construction at the jimmy swaggart bible school 
but swaggart seems undaunted and apparently is counting on the 
general presbytery to follow the louisiana districts 
recommendation that he be barred from the pulpit for only three 
months 
swaggart told the congregation wednesday that he was going out 
of his mind but when im back in the pulpit on may 22 ill be 
back in my mind 
may 22 would be three months from the day swaggart confessed and 
voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit

western europes top airline regulator is 
warning us officials that there may be a sudden rise in fares in 
this country as a result of deregulation 
frederick soerensen head of the air transport division at the 
european commission says us deregulation has been in the main 
successful but then he adds when we see how after the first 
few months of enthusiastic expansionism the number of operational 
airlines is tending to shrink further and further we may well 
wonder whether deregulation does not lead in the end to 
cartelization and whether the tendency for fares to fall in the 
first few years may not suddenly go in reverse 
what is more the united states has run into unexpected 
infrastructure problems and operating conditions are becoming 
difficult i am thinking in particular of airport congestion at 
peak operating times 
soerensens criticism was in a paper he distributed during a 
visit to the united states last week

this dating book and its really hot ridgeway told the group as 
he opened a book and a flame magically shot out 
the group laughed and ridgeway a public relations consultant 
finished his talk but he left the book behind when he left the 
hotel thursday 
a hotel employee called security guards when he opened the prop 
and saw wires and batteries a guard took it to a basement office 
checked it over and decided it was harmless 
but hotel officials had second thoughts on friday and called 
police 
there was a strange odor coming from it said sgt rick 
nelson of the bomb squad

democratic presidential caucuses raised the stakes in wisconsins 
april 5 primary 
massachussets gov michael s dukakis will begin an aggressive 
campaign of television advertising in wisconsin tuesday and will 
be in the state thursday through april 5 said dukakis wisconsin 
campaign manager pat forciea 
we feel this is a twoperson race forciea said 
some of the dukakis advertising will be new but he will not 
take on jackson in the commercials forciea said 
none of the ads are zapping anybody he said 
jackson edged dukakis in saturdays michigan caucuses for his 
first win in a major northern industrial state 
jackson said he was confident he could follow michigan with 
another victory in wisconsin because ive stood here with the 
meat packers in cudahy the auto workers in kenosha and the paper 
workers in de pere 
dukakis who entered saturdays caucuses as the frontrunner and 
ended in an almost 21 loss to jackson refused to categorize the 
results as a significant setback 
as i said in the beginning of this campaign its a 
marathon dukakis said youve asked me about inevitability as 
i have said on more than one occasion nothing is inevitable about 
anything in american politics 
i hope when we finish up in california and new jersey i have 
a lead i can take into the convention and win the 
nomination 
dukakis and jackson joined sen albert gore jr of tennesee 
rep richard gephardt of missouri and sen paul simon of 
illinois at a democratic party fundraising dinner in milwaukee 
saturday night 
both dukakis and jackson left sunday for connecticut to lobby 
for lastminute support before that states primary tuesday while 
simon and gore remained in wisconsin 
wisconsin democratic chairwoman suellen albrecht predicted 
nearly twothirds of the wisconsin voters who go to the polls april 
5 will vote for a democrat giving the state its largest role in 
selecting a presidential nominee in 12 years 
albrecht said wisconsin residents could expect to see 
fullblown campaigning efforts from all the remaining 
democratic candidates over the next 10 days 
prior to the jeffersonjackson day dinner in milwaukee all the 
candidates except jackson joined about 1500 people in an afternoon 
labor rally and march to support nearly 600 marathon electric corp 
shop workers represented by the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers local 1791 who have been involved in a 
fourmonth fight over wage cuts in wausau 
dukakis gephardt and simon walked behind a bright orange 
solidarity banner with the workers and their supporters 
each candidate wore orange armbands saying solidarity local 
1791 as they sought the vote of laborers in wisconsin 
youve got a fight on your hands and i want you to know 
youve got friends across the state and across the nation and were 
here gore told a rally at a downtown parking lot before the 
march 
jackson sent former new mexico gov toney anaya to show his 
support 
while the frontrunners began planning strategy to capture 
delegates in the remaining states gephardt prepared to meet with 
family and advisers to decide whether he would pull out of the race 
and run for reelection to congress 
gephardt has canceled his wisconsin schedule and scheduled a 
news conference today where it is expected he will annouce he will 
file as a candidate for reelection by tuesdays deadline 
gephardt had said he needed to do well in michigan to sustain a 
candidacy that took off in iowa but stumbled in the south on super 
tuesday he finished a disappointing third 
dukakis said the field of candidates probably would be narrowed 
again after wisconsins primary jackson declined to comment on 
whether a wisconsin victory would make him the frontrunner but 
jackson also said he had been the frontrunner for a year

the reagan administration is sending 
panamanians the blunt message that their nations crisis will end 
if the military turns on gen manuel antonio noriega 
ultimately i think its going to have to be the national 
guard itself that gets rid of him assistant secretary of state 
elliott abrams said sunday 
abrams appearing on cbstvs face the nation expressed hope 
that the military strongman would be forced out in a matter of 
days 
noriega has been indicted by a us federal grand jury on drug 
trafficking charges the reagan administration has demanded that 
noriega step down and go into exile 
the new york times in todays editions says administration 
officials considered forcible extradition of noriega to the united 
states 
panamanian opposition leaders in washington said they understood 
from the administration and from leaders in latin america that the 
united states had considered seeking to have noriega arrested in 
costa rica the newspaper said 
the times also said the panamanian strongman had tried to 
arrange a visit to costa rica over the weekend according to senior 
latin american diplomats the times said noriega wanted to discuss 
his political future with costa ricas president oscar arias 
sanchez and prime minister felipe gonzalez of spain 
gonzalez was in costa rica over the weekend spain has offered 
noriega asylum if the united states agrees not to ask madrid for 
his extradition 
panamanian opposition leaders said arias rejected noriegas 
request for a meeting and also refused to see a top deputy of the 
general 
abrams the state department official in charge of central and 
latin american policy acknowledged that he is surprised the 
military leader is still in power in the face of us opposition 
and a general strike at home 
i guessed wrong i thought hed be gone by now abrams said 
i think hes clinging at this point by his fingertips 
abrams made the comments as he pointed out that noriega has not 
been able to pay his military supporters 
on saturday bankers rejected a panamanian government demand for 
70 million in their vaults the governments attempt to secure the 
funds came after it was unable to meet the 15000member militarys 
payroll 
noriega ordered a shakeup of his forces after a failed coup on 
march 16 over the weekend he sent in troops and police to reopen 
panama citys flour mills in an attempt to break the general strike 
aimed at ousting the military leader 
the panamanian government has been strapped for cash because of 
economic sanctions taken by the united states us military aid to 
panama was suspended by congress last year as the political 
situation began to deteriorate 
abrams however said its got to be the national guard 
itself that forces noriega out of power he just wont leave 
he doesnt care about panama he doesnt care about the defense 
forces he doesnt care about the economy he doesnt care about 
the people 
asked about any possible threat to us citizens in the country 
abrams said the united states intends to protect the 50000 
military people and civilians there 
if there is a threat from gen noriega it wont last long 
he said 
abrams speaking with reporters following his television 
appearance was asked whether the united states would use its 
military to protect its interests in panama 
we have an obligation to protect americans in panama the 
bases and a treaty right and obligation to protect the panama 
canal and we will do it he responded 
abrams repeated administration assertions that an offer from the 
dominican republic to give asylum to noriega is not good enough 
and that it would be better if the military leader accepted a 
similar offer from spain 
the way to end this crisis is to get him out of the country 
abrams said

for peace in a special outdoors mass but many worried that contra 
leaders had been too eager to sign a ceasefire agreement with the 
sandinistas 
more than 300 people palm fronds in hand gathered in this

a moderate offshore earthquake rattled the 
hawaiian islands but caused no damage or injuries authorities said 
the temblor measuring 55 on the richter scale of ground 
motion struck at 533 pm sunday about 35 miles west of hawaii 
island fifteen minutes later an aftershock of 41 was recorded 
a 52 earthquake hit in the same area two days earlier 
the strength of sundays quake was not great enough to generate 
a tsunami or tidal wave said richard sillcox of the pacific 
tsunami warning center 
the temblor was unrelated to kilauea the worlds most active 
volcano which has been in eruption on hawaii island since jan 3 
1983 said tom wright scientist in charge of the us geological 
surveys hawaiian volcano observatory 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 55 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 45 
an earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated 
area while a 6 can cause severe damage the san francisco 
earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the richter scale was 
devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter scale

the chinese government today announced a major 
overhaul of its bureaucracy to streamline operations eliminate 
10000 jobs and reduce its role in the direct management of the 
economy 
song ping state councillor and head of the communist party 
organization department outlined proposals under which 14 
ministries under the state council will be abolished one redefined 
and 10 new ones set up 
it will mean a net reduction of five state council organs from 
the current 45 song told a session of the national peoples 
congress chinas parliament the 10000 staffers dropped from the 
payroll will be transferred to other jobs 
the new bodies should be set up within three months after being 
approved during the current congressional session but the process 
of making the state council more efficient and reducing overlapping 
will take time song said 
the functions of government offices and work methods cannot be 
changed all at once and a new work order cannot be established at 
once either he said 
song said the reorganization was transitional and will lay the 
groundwork for further restructuring of the state council 
equivalent to chinas cabinet 
the reorganization will address such problems as too rigid 
micromanagement and insufficient macrocontrol overlapping 
functions overstaffing low working efficiency and lack of clarity 
about duties the state councillor said 
the reforms will reduce the staff directly under the state 
council from 50000 to 40000 he said 
the government as part of reforms to separate the functions of 
government and business will no longer manage enterprises 
directly as it has under sovietstyle central planning song said 
instead government organs will be responsible for general 
planning finances supervision and regulation 
the current annual session of the congress which convened last 
week is also to pass a law guaranteeing the rights of factory 
managers to run their plants without undue interference from the 
government 
the 10 new bodies to be created are the ministries of personnel 
labor materials transportation energy construction aeronautics 
and astronautics industry water resources machine building and 
electronics industry and the state planning commission 
that commission merging the current planning and economic 
commissions is to be a powerful body in charge of formulating 
chinas development strategies 
song said the new commission will no longer engage in direct 
management of trade and industrial operations as the two existing 
commissions do the commission is expected to be headed by veteran 
economic expert and vice premier yao yilin who heads the current 
state planning commission 
the labor and personnel ministry will be split into two 
ministries with the new labor ministry responsible for overseeing 
reforms in chinas labor structure and the personnel ministry in 
charge of introducing a state civil servant system 
the new transportation ministry will combine the ministries of 
railways and communications and the state air transport control 
administration 
chinas antiquated and overtaxed transportation system has come 
under strong criticism as a result of one air crash and four fatal 
train crashes this year killing 277 people 
song outlined the proposed energy ministry as encompassing the 
work of the ministries of coal industry petroleum industry and 
nuclear industry 
the official xinhua news agency will become a separate 
institution under the state council previously it was an

a sixweekold sedition trial in which 
white supremacists are accused of plotting to overthrow the 
government by force could go to the allwhite jury this week if the 
defense completes its case 
prosecutors contend the 13 defendants conspired to replace the 
federal government with an aryan nation the defendants say the 
government is trying to silence its critics 
the defense started presenting its case last week in the sixth 
week of the trial and several defendants plan to take the stand 
prosecutors predicted when the trial began feb 16 that they 
would spend two months and call 200 witnesses but they rested 
monday after five weeks and 106 witnesses 
us district judge morris arnold has repeatedly reminded the 
jury mere disagreement with the government is not seditious 
conspiracy 
seditious conspiracy he said requires two or more persons to 
plot to bring down the government by actions that produce or are 
likely to produce imminent lawless action 
the government contends the sedition defendants robbed 
counterfeited bombed and murdered and witnesses have testified 
how money to do so was distributed 
a key government witness unindicted coconspirator james 
ellison led an arkansas white supremacist group the covenant 
the sword and the arm of the lord until his arrest in 1985 he is 
serving 20 years in prison 
ellison said defendant louis ray beam jr called for war against 
the government and that codefendant robert edward miles provided 
him with a 30gallon barrel of cyanide that could be used to poison 
the water of a large city like washington dc or new york city 
beam testified that the real issue in the trial was whether 
there would be liberty or tyranny in america today dissidents 
in some ways are treated as bad as dissidents in the soviet 
union he said 
miles says the government wants to silence him because hes a 
gadfly sometimes the government gets out its flyswatter miles 
said 
of the 14 defendants originally charged 10 were accused of 
seditious conspiracy one was acquitted for lack of evidence five 
defendants including one of the sedition defendants are accused 
of plotting to kill a federal judge and an fbi agent two sedition 
defendants are accused of the interstate transportation of stolen 
money

the rev jerry falwell has launched a 
petition drive to press for a presidential pardon for oliver north 
saying the government is using the fired national security council 
aide as a scapegoat in the irancontra affair 
falwell announced the petition drive sunday to his congregation 
at thomas road baptist church 
falwell said north who was indicted earlier this month for his 
role in the irancontra affair was only following orders and 
trying to do what a spineless congress wouldnt do in central 
america 
i decided we didnt have any hope with the independent counsel 
and the 250 staff members who are being paid with millions of our 
tax dollars to hang this man to imprison this man we cant win 
there falwell said referring to special prosecutor lawrence e 
walsh 
we cant win in the congress he said weve long since 
abrogated a congress that has enough statesmen in it to make a 
difference the majority of them are more committed to the next 
election than the next generation 
but we can appeal to the court of public opinion falwell 
said and ive decided to put together a national pardon petition 
to the president of the united states and see if i could find 2 or 
3 million people who would sign with me 
falwells petition says north who just retired as a marine 
corps lieutenant colonel fought communism in central america and 
in the process became the object of terrorist death threats 
the least our country can do is to free him from the cloud of 
persecution that hangs over his head and that of his family it 
says 
falwell said he would deliver the signed list personally to 
reagan 
in an interview following the church service falwell said he 
expects critics to accuse him of once again using his position to 
influence governmental matters he said however he is not acting 
in his capacity as the leader of the church or or the moral 
majority 
im doing this only as a citizen who appreciates what this man 
has done for me and my children he said

positions and were threatening a highway southwest of the garrison 
city of dezful

injured two weeks ago when iraqi warplanes dropped cyanide and 
mustard gas bombs on the towns after they had been captured in the

vigil outside the us embassy but refused to hand over a petition

report by a journalists group eleven of the deaths occurred in 
the philippines 
the report released sunday by the committee to protect 
journalists also listed 59 assaults on journalists and more than 
185 arrests or kidnappings of journalists 
eleven journalists were forced to leave their own countries 
under threats and 32 foreign journalists were expelled from the 
countries where they were working the committee also said 
these figures are a grim reminder that even in the midst of a 
worldwide communications revolution some still feel the temptation 
to kill the messenger said committee chairman josh friedman 
in 1986 the committee documented the killings of 15 
journalists 56 assaults and more than 190 arrests or kidnappings 
another 37 journalists were expelled and eight left countries 
under threat 
in the philippines the committee said most attacks against 
journalists took place within a series of retaliatory actions 
perpetrated by guerillas on one side and military and paramilitary 
or vigilante personnel on the other 
five of the 11 killed in the philippines more than any other 
country were killed aug 27 by armed men who broke into a radio 
station the victims reportedly had ties with an anticommunist 
radio commentator 
the committee to protect journalists is a nonprofit 
nonpartisan organization founded in 1981 by a group of american 
reporters and editors

an uneasy truce reigned between 
surfers and fishermen after the two sides fought over the right to 
use the waters around a popular jetty 
the two groups hurled obscenities bottles lead sinkers and 
fists at each other friday after surfers accused fishermen of 
deliberately casting their hooks and lines too close to them 
the brevard county sheriffs office broke up the fight and 
posted a deputy on the disputed jetty at sebastian inlet state 
recreational park which lies about 80 miles southeast of orlando 
there were no arrests 
deputy jeff ludwig said fishermen often cast off the jettys 
north railing while surfers frequently come within 10 years of the 
jetty but ludwig reported no problems over the weekend as surfers 
stayed 40 yards north of the jetty while fishermen cast their lines 
mostly from the south side 
its probably because im standing here ludwig said 
tom cross 32 a surfer from nearby melbourne beach agreed 
i think with that sheriffs deputy out there on the jetty 
people are going to be a little more careful how they cast cross 
said 
fishermen claim the jetty is the best fishing spot around and 
say surfers can ride the waves elsewhere 
people should show a little consideration for one another 
said gary hoover who admitted he intentionally hooked a surfer 
once for entering his fishing spot 
its ridiculous said hoover 27 of nearby satellite beach 
youve only got how many miles of beach in florida and only a 
couple of spots where fishermen like to fish i dont think they 
should be surfing this close to the jetty

jackie pflug suffered permanent brain 
damage when she was shot in the head and left for dead by arab 
terrorists during a 1985 airplane hijacking in malta today shes 
able to say shes glad it happened 
its not a hijacking story its a story of survival of 
learning about yourself said pflug 32 whose brain injury 
impaired her ability to read wiped out her shortterm memory and 
caused epileptic seizures 
in the 2 years since the hijacking pflug says she has learned 
to accept the fact that she lived while 59 other people including 
four of the five hijackers died and she has learned to love her 
new self 
now she is taking a years leave of absence from her job 
teaching learningdisabled children and firstgraders in nearby 
wayzata to tell her story on the lecture circuit 
pflug a teacher at the american school in cairo where her 
husband scott also taught was returning to cairo from athens 
when the egyptair jetliner was hijacked on nov 24 1985 just 15 
minutes into the flight 
the worst moment pflug said was the very first one 
the man stood up with the gun and the grenades he was 
grimacing and pulling at the grenades with his mouth and i had the 
realization that this was a hijacking and i thought were going 
to blow up in the air she said 
after the plane landed pflug was among two israelis and three 
americans who were tied and taken to the front of the plane one by 
one they were each shot and their bodies pushed out the door onto 
the pavement 
pflug one of two americans who survived the shootings was hit 
in the back ot the head but the bullet failed to penetrate her 
skull she lay still on the pavement for five hours before maltese 
workers were allowed to remove the bodies to the morgue where 
workers turned her over and found she was alive 
they started screaming shes alive i said are you the 
good guys or the bad guys pflug recalled 
while pflug underwent surgery in malta to have the bullet 
removed from her skull and bits of bone from her brain egyptian 
commandos stormed the plane as hijackers tossed grenades at the 
passengers and the pilot killed the terrorist leader with a fire 
ax when it was over 59 people were dead 
pflug was later transferred to a hospital in west germany then 
came to minnesota where her husbands parents live for more 
treatment at university of minnesota hospital 
im classified as severely disabled its a hidden handicap 
because i look so normal that people cant tell theres anything 
wrong with me it appears as if im not listening pflug told the 
star tribune of minneapolis 
her epileptic seizures are controlled by medication and pflug is 
able to teach again but her husband grades the papers because her 
reading ability is impaired 
the psychological problems caused by the hijacking have been 
difficult to overcome pflug said but therapy has helped 
pflug said not a day has gone by that she hasnt thought about 
the hijacking 
i see a man who looks like one of the hijackers or i hear a 
voice like one of the children on the plane or i see a gun said 
pflug but those thoughts have been changing lately partly the 
result of therapy she said 
i think about it but it doesnt get under my skin in the same 
way it doesnt control me i control it she said 
now pflug wants to share her experiences with others in hopes 
that she can help them id like to motivate people to take 
charge of their lives because life is just so wonderful i know 
that now she said 
so yes i am glad it happened i know thats a pretty bold 
thing to say but you have to go through the bad part to get to the 
good

in a pittsburgh boardinghouse in 1911 the 
children and grandchildren of slavery grapple with a world that 
wont let them forget the past and denies them the future 
it is the setting for joe turners come and gone august 
wilsons heartfelt and haunting tale of a church deacons obsessive 
search for his missing wife as well as for his identity as a black 
man 
the play which opened sunday at broadways ethel barrymore 
theater is wilsons third work to arrive in new york since 1984 
following ma raineys black bottom and fences it reaffirms 
and enlarges his reputation as a major american playwright 
joe turner is wilsons most ambitious play in it he blends 
african mysticism with compelling naturalistic drama the 
production beautifully directed by lloyd richards is rich in 
poetry humor and an almost visionary sense of time place and 
character 
the story unfolds slowly wilson weaves his spell gradually 
its his steady accumulation of detail that fascinates and finally 
mesmerizes 
some memorable figures live in this homey boardinghouse run by 
seth holly an ambitious entrepreneur and his hardworking 
goodnatured wife bertha the audience gets to know them all in 
this play more so than in ma rainey or fences even the 
minor characters have lives of their own 
chief among the boardinghouse inhabitants is bynum walker a 
selfstyled conjurin man who believes in incantations the 
beneficial effects of roots and herbs blood sacrifice and voodoo 
he is a link to a black mans african past although his magic has 
been americanized bynum sacrifices the neighbors pigeons and uses 
weeds from seths garden as healing herbs 
also living in the house is jeremy furlow a hotheaded young 
man recently arrived from the south and not yet aware that things 
wont be much different up north he takes up with mattie campbell 
a frail woman who visits the voodoo man for help in finding her 
lost mate and decides to stay instead she stands in contrast to 
another resident molly cunningham a resolutely realistic woman 
who knows she cant expect much out of life 
into the lives of these transients comes a strange menacing man 
wearing a long black coat and traveling with his young daughter 
herald loomis is looking for his wife martha the couple was 
separated years earlier when loomis was forced into a chain gang by 
the infamous reallife bounty hunter joe turner 
loomis believes his wife is in the pittsburgh area with the 
help of bynum and a white traveling salesman named rutherford 
selig he intends to find her 
the deacon described aptly by bynum as a man in search of his 
own song is the plays most disturbing character its his story 
that brings each of the plays two acts to dramatic conclusions at 
the end of act 1 the stage erupts in a joyous religious dance 
called a juba during this mystical and spiritual frenzy 
loomis has visions of the notsodistant past a time of slavery 
and bones walking on water 
its not until the second act that loomis finally confronts his 
wife and then slashes himself with a knife to exorcise the ghosts 
of long ago its not a sacrifice but rather a cleansing enabling 
loomis to face the future whether he and his wife will be able to 
pick up the pieces of their severed marriage is unclear but at 
least they will be able to try 
richards who also directed fences and ma rainey gets 
some fine ensemble work out of his large cast particularly 
impressive are delroy lindo as the tormented deacon ed hall as the 
homespun magic man and mel winkler as the exasperated boardinghouse 
owner wilson has also written a tender funny scene for two 
children and richards has coaxed two beautiful performances from 
richard parnell habersham and jamila perry 
the warm solid boardinghouse setting by scott bradley is capped 
by a splendid rooftop view of pittsburgh and a bridge spanning the 
entire stage its an evocative reminder that most of the people in 
this home are travelers displaced from the south and still not 
comfortable in the north 
joe turners come and gone is one more piece in the mosaic 
wilson is creating about black life in 20th century america one 
play for each decade fences is set in the 1950s while ma 
rainey takes place in the 1920s joe turner may be set even 
further in the past but it is a play that resonates with such 
feeling that it leaps across the years to speak powerfully and 
movingly to today 
among other critics frank rich of the new york times said that 
wilson has once again shown us how in another mans freedom we 
find our own the play is wilsons most profound and 
theatrically adventurous telling of his story to date rich wrote 
here is a lovely moving play that carries you with it like a 
matchbox on a flood wrote clive barnes of the new york post 
linda winer of new york newsday was equally impressed joe 
turner is august wilsons best play yet which means its a 
stunner she wrote the play has a breadth that connects the 
dots of neglected history into a picture we will never forget 
again 
but howard kissel of the daily news said while there are 
scenes of great power you feel that in his eagerness to 
envision a place where reconcilations abound wilson has minimized 
the conflict the characters and the period require

when he was down and out on the heels of the 
donna rice scandal gary hart quit the democratic campaign and in 
practically the same breath made the case for something called 
national service 
i would say to the young people of this country the torch of 
idealism burns bright in your hearts said hart it should lead 
you to public service and national service it should lead you to 
want to make this country better 
that was may 1987 on feb 29 1988 hart was back in the race 
but as evidenced at the polls no one was really listening 
and so the call for national service was hardly a burning 
issue when sen sam nunn addressed the democratic leadership 
council in williamsburg va and urged the setting up of a 
citizens corps to perform voluntary national service 
the plan could well emerge as a cornerstone of the democratic 
presidential campaign the 1988 version of john kennedys 1960 call 
to create a peace corps to perform good work overseas 
its a something for something approach to government 
young people would commit themselves to public service be it 
military service or civilian social service in return for living 
expenses plus a 10000ayear voucher like the gi bill 
nunn said the benefits could be used to cover school costs 
vocational training or a homeownership subsidy 
the proposal is not new to the presidential campaign not only 
was it one of harts cornerstone new ideas but paul simon and 
bruce babbitt also embraced the concept in their campaigns and on 
the republican side alexander haig jr proposed such a program 
before he dropped out 
hart babbitt simon nunn and haig all well and good but the 
proposal wont go anywhere unless one of the nominees adopts it as 
his own and the democratic leadership council has laid considerable 
groundwork 
the dlc is the group of moderate democrats who helped dream up 
the southern regional primaries and hoped the 1988 process would 
swing the democratic party into the political center 
i am convinced that national service can revitalize the spirit 
of civic responsibility and enterprise that built this nation and 
remains its greatest strength nunn said 
among the goals of the dlc program nunn said are 
to increase the number of military volunteers and help remedy 
some of our most urgent social problems like widespread 
illiteracy and inadequate child care and health care 
offer a decentralized and nonbureaucratic way to deliver 
human services to needy citizens 
the dlc plan would link federal student aid to national 
service he said contending the program thus would be a road 
to opportunity and upward mobility for our young people 
anticipating the first question about such a plan nunn added 
such a program of course wont be free nothing worthwhile ever 
is 
i believe however that a large portion of the costs of this 
program estimated in some quarters at 6 billion a year can be 
financed by shifting federal funds already being expended on 
student aid in the long run he said the program like the 
gi bill will return huge revenues to the treasury because every 
additional college graduate in america will earn 640000 more over 
their working life as compared to someone who doesnt go to 
college 
nunns concept and the idealistic appeal from hart recall 
kennedys peace corps an enduring element of his legacy even 25 
years after his death

the mayors of panama city and its 
largest suburb today threatened to crack down on a mass 
demonstration aimed at ousting gen manuel antonio noriega and 
ending the worst crisis in the nations history 
in a communique published in this mornings staterun 
newspapers the mayors said they had instructed competent 
authorities to enforce a ban on public demonstrations 
those authorities are the police and soldiers commanded by 
noriega 
but opposition leaders said they would proceed with plans for 
the afternoon protest march and called the ban illegal 
the protest march comes at the start of the second week of a 
general strike that has shut down an estimated 90 percent of the 
nations industry and commerce further aggravating a critical cash 
shortage 
on palm sunday roman catholic church leaders said government 
authorities fear this explosion of sentiments and appealed to 
both sides to show restraint the church leaders said in a 
statement they would send observers to todays march in panama city 
to try to keep the peace 
police and soldiers under noriega who heads the 15000member 
defense forces have suppressed recent demonstrations with tear gas 
and shotguns 
also sunday the social security institute said it will pay its 
55000 retirees up to 150 of their semimonthly pension benefits 
this week they had threatened to join todays march if they didnt 
receive their payments 
last week the government was without money to pay the members 
of the defense forces and faces another 33 million payroll for its 
130000 civilian employees this week raising the possibility of 
intensified protests 
in washington elliott abrams the assistant secretary of state 
for interamerican affairs predicted on sunday that many of the 
marchers will be members of the families of the defense forces 
the government on sunday expelled a reporter for the french news 
agency agence france press because his visa had been issued a 
panamanian consular official in washington loyal to deposed 
president eric arturo delvalle 
opposition figures crticized the government for its planned 
crackdown on the demonstration 
peaceful protest is a right written in the constitution 
opposition leader jose faundes said sunday it is above any 
decree any law 
we hope they realize they cannot repress the will of the 
people said aurelio barria a leader of the national civic 
crusade a coalition of more than 200 business professional labor 
and student groups this will be a physical expression of protest 
against noriega 
the crusade said the march would begin in front of the church of 
don bosco near the center of panama city and proceed to a park 
about half a mile away 
the latest government crisis began last month when the noriega 
controlled leislative assembly deposed delvalle after he tried to 
fire noriega 
noriega had recently been indicted in florida on drug 
trafficking charges 
the united states responded to delvalles ouster by freezing 
panamanian assets in the united states and reiterating its support 
for delvalle as the chief executive president reagan has also 
called on noriega to resign 
there were violent demonstrations 12 days ago after the 
goverment was unable to meet payrolls and a small group of 
disenchanted defense forces officers staged an unsuccessful coup 
against noriega 
in its toughest action soldiers loyal to noriega seized two 
major flour mills saturday including a plant owned by the general 
mills corp and confiscated 13 million pounds of ground wheat and 
corn valued at 227500 
owners of the mills had responded to a government announcement 
of its plan to confiscate their plants by saying they would instead 
donate their entire stocks of flour to the catholic churchs food 
program for the poor 
the church quickly thanked the mills for such a humanitarian 
gesture but soldiers seized the plants and moved the flour to 
government warehouses before it could be delivered to caritas the 
churchs welfare agency 
also saturday soldiers reopened panama citys balboa port 
where workers had built barricades during their strike that began 
march 13 the port is at the pacific entrance of the panama canal 
which continues to operate normally

gov buddy roemer says the unprecedented 
authority given him by the legislature to repair the states 
finances will be tempered by compassion and his awareness that 
lawmakers are looking over his shoulder 
budget officials worked through the weekend to come up with a 
list of proposed cuts to present to roemer today after the 
legislature wound up a special session by approving the emergency 
bills the governor was expected to sign the package today 
the budgetary authority is aimed at meeting a fiscal crisis 
which threatens to bankrupt the state 
in addition to giving roemer power to cut entire state programs 
and close institutions through june 30 the end of the fiscal year 
lawmakers granted the administration the right to raise fees for 
state services without public hearings or legislative oversight 
after lawmakers finished work saturday roemer said the 
temporary budget authority will be tempered by my compassion and 
good sense that they legislators will be coming back in three and 
a half weeks to look over my shoulder 
the governor said he was aiming for 50 million in spending cuts 
for the remaining quarter of the fiscal year and 22 million in fee 
increases 
the rest of the 200 million deficit expected this fiscal year 
will be met by issuing shortterm bonds or delaying payments for 
services rendered to the state roemer said he also said layoffs 
of an undetermined number of state employees would be needed 
over a full year the spending cuts would total about 200 
million if the legislature did not change them during its regular 
session beginning in april while the fee hikes would bring in 
about 88 million he said 
those are the targets i dont know if i will be able to reach 
either he said 
commissioner of administration brian kendrick said budget 
officials worked through the weekend to come up with the list of 
proposed cuts 
kendrick also said work would begin on the new louisiana 
recovery corp created by the legislature to govern a statewide 
taxing district that could impose up to a 1 percent sales tax the 
tax would finance the issuance of bonds that would pay off the 
states 13 billion longterm debt 
the administrationdominated commission cannot issue bonds or 
impose the levy until the legislature drops the same amount from 
the current 4cent state sales tax 
the administration will ask the louisiana supreme court to rule 
on the consitutionality of the commission if it does not pass 
legal muster the state will use shortterm bonds to finance the 
debt kendrick said 
those are the only two ways out he said

press asked that the information be made public 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of the news 
organizations in january

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
300 million copyrightinfringement lawsuit against the creators 
and marketers of trivial pursuit a popular board game 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the author of 
several encyclopedias on trivia that many of the questions 
contained in the board game infringed on his copyright works 
trivial pursuit a game utilizing questionandanswer cards was 
conceived in 1979 by chris haney and scott abbot who along with 
john haney developed the concept 
in 1981 the three joined with ed werner in forming a canadian 
corporation horn abbott ltd to market the game abbot and chris 
haney assigned their rights to the corporation and horn abbot lt 
obtained a canadian copyright in the game 
in late 1982 horn abbot contracted with selchow amp righter co 
to distribute the game in the united states and by the end of 1984 
sales had reached 256 million 
fred worth a california resident who had authored two volumes 
of the complete unabridged super trivia encyclopedia sued the 
two corporations and the four canadians behind horn abbot in late 
1984 
his lawsuit alleged that the genus silver screen and baby 
boomer editions of trivial pursuit each containing 6000 
questions and answers were guilty of copyright infringement 
for example worth contended that 1675 of the genus editions 
6000 questions were taken from his first encyclopedia volume 
the trivial pursuit creators did not deny consulting worths 
books in developing the board game but they said his books were 
among numerous reference sources used 
a federal trial judge in los angeles upheld by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals last september threw out the suit 
the appeals court ruled that there was no substantial 
similarity between worths books and the trivial pursuit 
questionandanswer cards 
the case is worth vs selchow amp righter co 871268

some locations today threatening homes and businesses in cologne 
bonn and other communities 
major rivers across west germany have been flooding for about 
two weeks but heavy rains over the weekend worsened the situation

between mainz and koblenz and disrupted trains in the area 
officials said about 1400 people were evacuated sunday night 
and early today after the danube burst through several dikes near 
regensburg about 45 miles north of munich

community leaders appealed for calm after 
the slaying of an activist who had sought to become the first 
indian judge in racially tense robeson county but two other 
candidates reported receiving death threats 
julian pierce 42 was killed in his home early saturday by 
three shotgun blasts fired at pointblank range in what 
authorities called the first assassination of a candidate for 
political office in the state no arrests have been made 
since the killing pierces opponent in the judgeship race and a 
friend of pierce running for office in forsyth county have reported 
receiving death threats the charlotte observer said today 
the rev joy johnson of the first baptist church said sunday he 
hoped the crime could be solved before the heat rises and before 
there is a war 
weve had a calm night and day but it will take at least a 
few more days until the tension is out of the air said johnson 
who along with other community leaders appealed to residents on 
sunday to avoid violence anything could spark something i hope 
that doesnt happen 
pierce a lawyer was running for a superior court judgeship in 
robeson county where few indians hold office or work in law 
enforcement despite a population that is 37 percent indian 
he was alone saturday morning in his brick ranch house which is 
flanked by farmland and another small house authorities said 
the best we can establish he got home shortly after midnight 
he undressed and went to bed said robeson county sheriff hubert 
stone then someone came to the back door knocking pierce 
slipped on a pair of jeans and went to the door when he got to the 
door the person either shot through the window or stuck the gun 
through the window and shot pierce in the chest 
as pierce turned he was then shot in the lower left side 
pierce fell to the floor the sheriff said 
it just looked like he was actually assassinated he said 
earl moore who said he had known pierce for 15 years said the 
candidate knew that something could happen to him moore said 
he knew of a threat against pierce but said he would talk only to 
federal officials in washington not to county state or federal 
officials in north carolina 
jim hatcher a friend of pierce who is running for a seat on the 
board of county commissioners in forsyth county across the state 
around winstonsalem told the observer that he received an 
anonymous telephone call late sunday in which someone said get 
out of town 
i plan to talk to gov martin he said the people are 
wanting to talk but theyre scared either martins going to do 
something or else 
hatcher is the uncle of eddie hatcher who with timothy jacobs 
took over the robesonian newspaper in lumberton on feb 1 to 
protest alleged government corruption in robeson county 
lumberton police said they began guarding district attorney joe 
freeman britts home sunday after he reported receiving threats 
britt who was running against pierce and his family were in 
seclusion under police protection 
pierce grew up in neighboring hoke county and worked in a 
virginia shipyard after graduating from college he returned to 
north carolina and attended north carolina central university law 
school then worked for the us securities and exchange commission 
from 1976 to 1978 
he moved to robeson county to serve as the first director of 
lumbee river legal services representing those too poor to afford 
lawyers and practicing public interest law 
he was an easygoing guy he never had no problem with anyone 
that i heard tell of people liked him stone said 
pierces supporters said they might try to field another 
candidate in the upcoming primary 
the question is whether or not that will be allowed under the 
general statutes said sam kerns of pembroke well be meeting 
again but i really dont think that it may be possible 
according to the law 
pierces campaign manager harvey goodwin said supporters are 
considering a request for a special session of the state 
legislature to consider postponing the judicial race 
britt a white has been district attorney in the county for 14 
years but pierce was considered the leader in the race because of 
a controversial vote by indians earlier this month to consolidate 
the countys five school systems which are divided largely along 
racial lines 
the election was to be decided may 3 the date of the democratic 
primary since no republicans were in the race 
the judgeship pierce had sought was created to help ensure that 
minorities would have an opportunity to elect a judge the 
legislature gave the county its own judicial district separating 
it from adjoining scotland county 
indian leaders met sunday but would not allow reporters to 
attend a meeting saturday resulted in a request to state officials 
to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate pierces death 
robeson county which borders on south carolina is also 37 
percent white and 26 percent black it is one of the states 
poorest counties and has long been torn by racial animosity 
activism particularly by lumbees has thrived since november 
1986 when a sheriffs deputy fatally shot an unarmed lumbee 
anger at what the indians call corrupt local government and 
entrenched racism boiled over feb 1 in the hostagetaking at the

house on the outskirts of the capital killing four residents who 
were burned beyond recognition after an hourlong gunbattle 
south africa which claims that neighboring botswana harbors 
guerrillas hostile to pretoria called the victims terrorists it 
said it was responsible for the attack in a statement issued by its 
defense force in pretoria 
the office of president quett masire of botswana said four 
people died a south african man two batswana women and a third 
unidentified woman the botswana press association quoted deputy 
police commissioner norman moleboge as saying residents reported

africans attacked in the township of phiring known locally as 
tsholofelo the community lies two miles from the center of the 
capital of gaborone a border city 
the office of the president strongly condemns this dastardly 
attack and murder of innocent people in botswana by the south 
african army said botswanas statement the office of the 
president once again reiterates botswanas belief that south 
africas problems cannot be resolved by attacking neighboring 
countries such as botswana and strongly urges the south african 
government to engage in meaningful negotiations with the genuine 
leadership of the oppressed majority in that country 
south africas government and economy are controlled by 5 
million whites the countrys 26 million blacks have no vote in

afire by the attackers and that gasoline containers were found at 
the scene the botswana press association said it was believed an 
explosion may have been caused by a gas cylinder in the house 
which was destroyed

col moammar gadhafi said today he is 
withdrawing libyan troops from the egyptian border and promised 
libya would not use force to undermine the egyptian state 
if carried out the libyan leaders decision would represent an 
unprecedented conciliatory move gadhafi began feuding with egypt 
about 15 years ago 
gadhafis announcement followed a series of smallerscale 
reciprocal goodwill gestures between the two countries in recent 
weeks 
gadhafi made the announcement in a speech at a former british 
base at the mediterranean city of tobruk near the egyptian border 
the speech broadcast live by libyan television and monitored in 
london was delivered at a ceremony marking the 18th anniversary of 
britains evacuation of military bases in libya 
in another departure from longstanding hostile policy toward 
cairo gadhafi said libya would not use force to overthrow 
president hosni mubaraks government or get it to renounce its 1979 
peace treaty with israel the treaty was among numerous sore spots 
in egyptianlibyan friction 
the speech contained one antiegyptian barb however with 
gadhafi charging that egypt abandoned the arab world when it 
signed the americanmediated camp david agreements with israel 
i hereby declare the withdrawal of all military troops from 
along the libyanegyptian artificial borders gadhafi said 
i want to emphasize to the egyptian people and army that the 
libyan eastern military zone along the border will finally be 
abolished 
gadhafi did not say how many troops libya has along the border 
neither did he specify a time frame for the pullback 
the egyptianlibyan feud began in 1972 when cairo rejected 
gadhafis bid for immediate merger of the two countries 
egypt blamed gadhafi for a series of bombings in cairo and other 
cities in 1975 and 1976 and the two countries fought a fiveday 
border war in july 1977 the political tension deepened when egypt 
since the peace treaty with israel and moved closer to the united 
states 
gadhafi who overthrew the libyan monarchy in a military coup in 
1969 offered to let egypt verify the troop withdrawal 
if egypt wants to ascertain this it will be able to observe 
and we accept any verification commission or any observer or 
monitor who would be satisfied that this region is completely 
evacuated by military forces he said 
the libyan leader said his forces will be withdrawn without us 
asking for anything in return from the egyptian side

the supreme court today agreed to hear the 
appeal of a convicted killer who said his rights were violated when 
he was denied an opportunity to talk to his lawyer during a trial 
recess 
the court said it will review a ruling that denied a new trial 
to the south carolina man 
the defendant donald ray perry was convicted of murder 
kidnapping and criminal sexual assault in the killing of mary 
heimberger whose body was found on march 7 1981 in a wooded area 
in richland county sc he was sentenced to life in prison 
perry confessed to police that he had shot the victim but said 
it was an accident 
ms heimberger had been raped shot in both kneecaps and fatally 
shot in the chest 
during a 15minute trial recess while perry was testifying his 
lawyer sought to speak to him to advise him about his rights on 
crossexamination but the judge refused to allow them to talk 
perry filed a federal court appeal in 1985 and a judge ruled 
that his rights were violated the judge said denying perry the 
right to talk to his laywer during a recess no matter how brief 
is grounds for throwing out the conviction 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the 
conviction in november 
not every limitation of the relationship between a defendant 
and his attorney violates the defendants right to counsel the 
appeals court said 
the appeals court said barring a defendant from meeting with his 
lawyer during a brief trial recess is not automatic grounds for 
declaring a new trial there must be evidence that the denial 
prejudiced the case against the defendant the appeals court said 
the appeals court relied in part on two supreme court rulings in 
1984 that reinstated criminal convictions of two defendants who 
said they were denied effective legal assistance at their trials 
the high court said a claim of ineffective representation must 
be examined in the context of whether the trial produced a just 
result 
the appeals court said that standard also should apply to 
perrys claim 
it would make little sense to maintain a per se automatic 
rule of reversal for a brief restriction on consultation but to 
inquire into prejudice if perry had been represented incompetently 
throughout the appeals court said 
to reverse automatically a conviction because of an absence of 
consultation during one brief fortuitous recess in a trial which 
spanned nearly two weeks would be to confer a benefit upon a 
criminal defendant who may not deserve it the appeals court 
added 
it also said the evidence against perry was overwhelming 
and there was no indication that denying him the chance to confer 
with his lawyer prior to crossexamination altered his testimony 
significantly 
it would be wrong to exalt technical perfection at the expense 
of our societys legitimate and weighty interest in punishing 
offenders the appeals court said 
the case is perry vs leeke 876325

called for a general strike 
tass said today the communist party central committee and 
governments council of ministers approved plans for construction 
of more schools including armenian schools in nagornokarabakh 
and other regions of azerbaijain where ethnic armenians live

a 24hour general strike today shut 
factories airports and banks across portugal as hundreds of 
thousands of workers staged the biggest industrial action in the 
countrys history to protest government labor reforms 
the communist and socialist labor federations united for the 
first time claimed the strike was a victory for the unions over 
the centerright government of prime minister anibal cavaco silva 
cavaco silva whose social democrats hold a solid parliamentary 
majority said the strike would not cause him to alter a single 
line of a government bill that would make it easier for businesses 
to fire workers he said the legislation is crucial to attracting 
investment in portugal and modernizing the economy 
labor leaders said 85 percent of union members supported the 
strike 
the government cannot act as if were deaf dumb and blind in 
the face of this massive protest said manuel carvalho da silva 
a leader of the communistdominated general confederation of 
portuguese workers 
but the government said in a statement the country is working 
normally apart from the transport sector where there have been some 
clear cases of sabotage the labor ministry said unions were 
exaggerating the extent of support for the strike 
twentytwo incoming flights and 29 departures were cancelled at 
lisbon airport and many other international flights were diverted 
officials said 
most flights of the stateowned airline tapair portugal were 
cancelled at oporto airport in the north and faro in the south 
stateowned public transport companies were hit hardest by the 
strike train services were paralyzed across the country bus 
trams subway and ferry services were reduced to skeleton services 
required under strike law 
police said two shots were fired at a private bus in the 
northern city of porto no one was injured traffic was not heavily 
congested in most cities as many workers stayed home police said 
the government says existing labor legislation passed in the 
wake of a leftist military coup that returned portugal to democracy 
in 1975 is so protective that it is almost impossible for 
companies to dismiss workers 
cavaco silva says this deters investors and is prejudicial to 
workers because it encourages companies to hire them on shortterm 
contracts use child labor and keep wages low 
the government says the new legislation will still provide 
greater protection than workers enjoy in any other west european 
country or the united states 
unions and the leading socialist opposition party say the 
legislation will give managers the power to fire workers whenever 
and whyever they like

the supreme court today turned away an unusual 
copyright dispute that pitted the easter seal society against 
playboy enterprises 
the justices over one dissenting vote rejected arguments that 
playboy illegally used materials intended for an easter seal 
telethon in a pornographic movie 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
new orleans musician and entertainer ronnie kole acting on 
behalf of the easter seal society contracted with public 
television station wyes in 1982 to make a videotape of a staged 
mardi grasstyle parade and dixieland jam session 
the videotape was edited into a 16minute version for the 
societys national telethon for crippled children and was 
broadcast march 28 1982 
a year later wyes broadcasting director julius cain received a 
telephone call from john thompson a canadian television producer 
who requested videotape of a mardi gras parade 
cain unaware of thompsons exact intentions provided an 
unedited copy of the easter seal tape portions of the tape were 
incorporated into a movie entitled candy the stripper a 
sexually explicit film carried on cable televisions playboy 
channel 
some viewers in the new orleans area who had taken part in the 
staged mardis gras parade upon seeing themselves in the 
pornographic movie complained that their privacy rights were 
invaded 
the easter seal society then sued playboy enterprises wyes a 
canadian film producer and others accusing them of copyright 
violations 
the society said it and not wyes owns the copyright on the 
videotape 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled against the society 
last april the appeals court said congress in 1976 narrowed the 
copyright protection for those who hire others to produce original 
works 
because wyes was an independent contractor the easter seal 
society was not the sole author of the mardi gras videotape 
the appeals court said 
wyes did not simply set up one camera on a tripod turn it on 
and sit down to watch the staged parade and dixieland 
performance the appeals court continued instead it worked 
cooperatively and dynamically with the performers to create the 
tape 
reagan administration lawyers asked by the high court last 
november for their views said the 5th circuit courts 
interpretation of copyright laws workmadeforhire provisions 
differs from those of other appeals courts but they said the 
present case is not an appropriate vehicle for resolving the 
conflict in the circuits 
in another copyright case the court refused to revive a 300 
million copyrightinfringement lawsuit against the creators and 
marketers of trivial pursuit a popular board game 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the author of 
several encyclopedias on trivia that many of the questions 
contained in the board game infringed on his copyright works 
in other action the court 
agreed to hear the appeal of a convicted killer who said his 
rights were violated when he was denied an opportunity to talk to 
his lawyer during a trial recess 
the court said it will review a ruling that denied a new trial 
to the south carolina man 
refused to hear an appeal by former new york city political 
boss meade esposito who sought to prevent public disclosure of 
certain court documents 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling challenged by 
esposito the former brooklyn democratic boss convicted of giving 
illegal gratuities to rep mario biaggi dny 
the copyright dispute case is easter seal society vs playboy

baby m is happy and secure with her 
father and his wife and shows no more attachment to the surrogate 
mother who refused to surrender her than she does to her 
babysitter the toddlers father testified today 
william stern testifying at a court hearing over visitation 
rights for surrogate mother mary beth whiteheadgould said he 
believes his daughter should not be allowed to see mrs 
whiteheadgould for several years 
mrs whiteheadgould who agreed to bear the child under a 
10000 contract with stern currently is allowed to see the child 
once a week for two hours under supervision 
the visitation fight is the final legal phase of the court 
battle involving baby m now melissa stern who turned 2 sunday 
the court hearing was ordered in a landmark ruling by the new 
jersey supreme court overturning surrogacy for pay 
both sides in the dispute strongly disagree over what would be 
in the best interest of the girl with the key issue centering on 
whether continued contact with mrs whiteheadgould would be 
harmful or healthy 
the child conceived by artificial insemination using sterns 
sperm lives with stern and his wife elizabeth in their tenafly 
home 
stern likened melissa to a young sapling that has to put down 
its roots 
if anything is done to interrupt her putting down those roots 
im afraid melissa does not have much of a future he said during 
a halfhour of testimony 
melissa calls him dada and his wife mama he noted 
stern acknowledged under crossexamination by mrs 
whiteheadgoulds attorney joel siegal that melissa appeared to 
be suffering no ill effects from her visits with mrs 
whiteheadgould and he said he would be willing to try to work out 
a visitation arrangement if the court ordered one 
the critical thing is that these adults can get on with their 
lives put the conflicts of the past behind them and support one 
another said dr david brodzinsky who acted as a 
courtappointed psychologist in the widely publicized 1986 trial 
that marked the first court ruling on a surrogacy contract 
the judge in that trial barred mrs whiteheadgould from seeing 
melissa but on feb 3 the state supreme court declared surrogacy 
for pay illegal and restored mrs whiteheadgoulds parental 
rights while granting custody to the sterns 
the supreme court in ordering todays visitation hearing made 
no specific recommendations on visitation and gave the lower court 
the broadest powers to resolve the issue 
mental health experts who have examined melissa say she appears 
to be unaffected by the legal storm around her she was described 
as friendly with adults while being more attached to stern than to 
her mother 
in court papers filed last week mrs whiteheadgould says she 
wants liberal unsupervised visitation the sterns are seeking a 
halt to visitation for several years 
the session before superior court judge birger m sween is 
expected to last about three days the high court ruled that the 
issue of visitation must be resolved by early may 
in court papers mrs whiteheadgould says she wants visitation 
immediately expanded to eight hours twice a week unsupervised at 
her home in east brunswick she says she wants the visits 
eventually to include half the summer and some holidays 
mrs whiteheadgould has fashioned an excellent relationship 
with melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing 
and productive relationship according to papers filed by her 
attorney harold cassidy 
but the sterns attorney gary skoloff argues in court papers 
that no contact would be better for the child because mrs 
whiteheadgould does not offer a healthy environment for her 
particularly in the last year since the mother became pregnant out 
of wedlock divorced her former husband and married wall street 
accountant dean gould 
skoloff did not spell out in the court papers how long contact 
should be discontinued in an interview he said as long as 
possible and mrs whiteheadgoulds attorneys say the sterns are 
seeking a sixyear moratorium on visits 
mrs whiteheadgoulds attorneys see her divorce and remarriage 
in a positive light arguing that she has a more stable 
relationship and financially secure lifestyle

the supreme court today refused to disqualify 
a bankruptcy judge from presiding over a georgia case in which he 
ordered the winning side to ghostwrite opinions he then signed 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that the 
judges actions while illadvised did not violate the losing 
sides rights 
the case involves bankruptcy proceedings begun in 1975 in which 
colony square co a developer was ordered to surrender ownership 
of a 200 million real estate development in atlanta to the 
prudential insurance co of america 
the insurance company was the developers chief creditor 
bankruptcy court judge hugh robinson after a hearing in the 
dispute on june 22 1984 telephoned prudential lawyer francis m 
bird jr later that day and told him he intended to rule in favor 
of the insurance firm 
robinson outlined what he intended to say in his ruling and 
asked bird to prepare the order 
after some minor typographical corrections the judge signed the 
order drafted by bird 
lawyers for colony square were not told of the conversation 
between robinson and bird or that the judges order was written by 
prudentials attorney 
robinsons orders were ghostwritten on two subsequent occasions 
when he denied a requem and thereby leads to stronger 
sounder judicial rulings 
but the appeals court said colony squares dueprocess rights 
were not violated because robinson already had decided the case 
before asking for birds help and because colony square had ample 
opportunity to argue its side before robinson and before the 
federal judge that reviewed the case 
robinsons actions in preparing these orders have little to 
recommend them the appeals court said but the process did not 
prejudice colony square and was not fundamentally unfair 
the supreme court is reviewing a related issue in a louisiana 
dispute over ownership of a hospital corporation in that case the 
justices have agreed to decide whether federal judges may be 
disqualified from presiding in cases when they are unaware they 
have a connection to the case that presents a possible conflict of 
interest a decision is expected by july 
the case acted on today is colony square vs prudential 
insurance co 871299

independent counsel lawrence walsh has reached 
agreement with israel after yearlong negotiations for its 
cooperation in his investigation of the irancontra affair both 
sides announced today 
under the accord israel has given walsh the historical and 
financial chronologies covering its role in the shipment of us 
weapons to iran in 1985 and 1986 said an israeli official 
he walsh will get what he wants without us having to give up 
what we wanted said the official speaking on condition he not 
be named 
israel had sought immunity from prosecution for the four key 
israeli players in the arms sales profits from which were diverted 
to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
two former white house aides and two us businessmen have been 
indicted in the united states for conspiracy to defraud the 
government in the funds diversion 
israel also gave walsh written answers to questions posed by the 
congressional investigators who received the israeli chronologies 
last summer said the official 
the government of the state of israel and the office of the 
independent counsel have signed an agreement covering the 
cooperation of the government of israel in the irancontra 
investigation walshs office said in a prepared statement 
walshs spokesman jim wieghart and israeli embassy spokesman 
yossi gal said the terms of the agreement are confidential 
israel had turned over the chronologies to the congressional 
irancontra committees but refused to give them to walsh pending 
his promise to refrain from prosecuting the four israelis involved 
in the affair 
negotiations with walsh were further complicated when he 
subpoenaed the four israelis former foreign ministry director 
david kimche former counterterrorism adviser amiram nir 
businessman yaakov nimrodi and his usborn associate al 
schwimmer 
in asking for immunity israel contended that the four acted at 
the request of the israeli government and therefore were not 
accountable as individuals 
two senior israeli officials held talks with walshs office 10 
days ago to wind up the negotiations which have been going on 
since early 1987 the israeli government approved the accord said 
the israeli official 
the negotiations were difficult said wieghart israel is 
a sovereign state with certain national security interests which 
they have to defend we recognized that but on the other hand we 
had our needs in this investigation he said

joni mitchell says she never made a record 
with commercial success a prime motive 
im a composer not a pop star that can be decorated into 
fashion she said in a recent interview talking about her move 
from pop to jazz after her 1974 blockbuster album court and 
spark 
i was never comfortable with all the attention i received as a 
result of the success of court and spark she said i never 
courted that kind of fame because im a backbush canadian and was 
raised to believe that if you stick your head up it will probably 
get knocked off 
but mitchell 44 is now out with a new album an upbeat pop 
record called chalk mark in a rain storm it features eight 
songs with guest artists don henley tom petty willie nelson 
peter gabriel wendy amp lisa and billy idol 
is the star quotient a calculated move at commercial success 
james taylor and crosby stills nash amp young were around when 
i made my early records and i put them to work she said i 
recorded some of this album at peter gabriels studio and he 
dropped by one day so i put him to work i met wendy amp lisa through 
prince whod been inviting me to a lot of things 
what i did do here that ive never done before was seek out 
singers i didnt know because i thought they were suited to songs 
billy idol and willie nelson fall into this category

more than a century after union and 
confederate soldiers spilled blood over stretches of land from 
pennsylvania to virginia a group is battling developers for the 
real estate 
the association for the preservation of civil war sites was 
organized last summer to buy land or development rights of 
battlefields unprotected by the national park service or other 
organizations 
all of us have watched over the past couple of years as a 
tremendous amount of historic ground has disappeared said gary 
w gallagher a penn state university history professor who is 
president of the organization 
if something isnt done in the next five years itll be too 
late he said 
gallagher said the organization has 500 members and has raised 
more than 10000 the organization received taxexempt status last 
month and plans to begin soliciting members this spring he said 
urban sprawl from the civil war capitals of washington and 
richmond va has engulfed many battlefields and threatens others 
a large mall has been planned for an important part of the 
manassas battlefield in northern virginia where the second battle 
of bull run was fought 
annie snyder who lives on a 180acre farm adjacent to the 
battlefield earlier this year organized a group called save the 
battlefield coalition to fight the mall 
also five parcels of land on the cedar creek battlefield near 
winchester va are for sale 
one of the cedar creek sites has already been targeted as a 
light industrial park and it will be a light industrial park 
unless someone buys that ground before the end of the year he 
said 
many of the former battlefields are farm or pasture land 
encroaching development has raised real estate prices and taxes 
according to gallagher 
its difficult to go to a land owner who hasnt been able to 
make it as a farmer and has just been offered 2 million for his 
land how do you convince that person not to take the 2 million 
and run he said 
gallagher said the formation of the group was prompted last 
summer by a developers who slipped bulldozers onto northern 
virginias chantilly battlefield in the middle of the night 
initially the developers had agreed to delay any excavation 
until historical surveying could be conducted according to 
gallagher only five acres were preserved to commemorate the 
battle he said 
the national park service owns and maintains several civil war 
battlefields including sites in gettysburg antietam monassas 
fredericksburg appomatox and richmond 
many others remain unprotected gallagher said 
among them are sites in the shenandoah valley where confederate 
general stonewall jackson staged his 1862 campaign and at brandy 
station in northcentral virginia the site of the largest cavalry 
battle in the western hemisphere gallagher said 
gallagher said the organization plans to buy land or development 
rights and turn the property over to historical societies or 
government organizations to manage 
were not talking about buying thousands and thousands of 
acres we know some growth is inevitable we just think there has 
to be some balance between growth and preserving a part of our 
past he said

about 800 american soldiers 
deployed in honduras in a show of force against nicaragua left 
today aboard seven c141 cargo planes bound for the united states 
the soldiers from the 82nd airborne division were whistling and 
shouting as they boarded the planes the first of the american 
contingent to leave honduras 
this is nice its beautiful said sgt elliott cook 22 of 
miami when he saw the planes to carry him and his fellow soldiers 
home i am happy to go home because nothing happened 
outside the palmerola air base about 200 hondurans demonstrated 
their support for the americans 
they carried signs saying thanks for having helped us 
maintain our liberty and unity makes for democracy thanks for 
being here 
the paratroopers were scheduled for an airdrop into their home 
base of fort bragg nc 
they are part of a force rushed to honduras for 11 days of 
training exercises to flex us military muscles after a reported 
incursion by about 2000 nicaraguan troops chasing ussupported 
contra rebels 
im sure theyll be home for a late dinner at least maj 
gary hovatter the us military public affairs officer at this 
base 40 miles northwest of the honduran capital of tegucigalpa 
said sunday he said the soldiers would probably parachute into 
fort bragg at about 5 pm est today 
its great to be going home said sgt dale taylor 22 of 
red springs nc its going to be a sisboombah occasion 
theyre going to have a band and our families will be there 
president reagan ordered 3200 paratroopers and light infantry 
to honduras on march 17 and 18 honduran president jose azcona hoyo 
asked for a show of force against after the reported incursion 
nicaragua denied the report and claimed the united states was 
preparing to invade or using the deployment as a cover for 
providing equipment to the contras us officials have said the 
troops are taking back all the equipment they brought with them 
including tanks and aircraft 
first theyll have to go through a complete inventory of 
property to make sure they can account for all the equipment they 
brought hovatter said 
in addition to the 82nd airborne the reinforcements include 
soldiers from the 7th light infantry in fort ord calif all are 
expected home by wednesday 
the presence of the reinforcements which raised us strength 
in honduras to more than 6000 alarmed the region and raised the 
already high level of tension tensions eased when the contras and 
the sandinistas signed a broad ceasefire accord last week after 
three days of talks in sapoa nicaragua 
the us troops never saw action but the honduran president 
said all along he expected them to back him up if the sandinistas 
didnt withdraw 
by late last week honduran officials said the nicaraguan troops 
were back on their own side of the border 
capt steve walker 30 of new milford nj said he thinks the 
strong us presence helped bring about the ceasefire 
the nicaraguans did cease action and they did withdraw and 
they did sit down and start negotiation with the contras without 
any shots being fired he said it was an effective display of 
resolve

jurors in the robert chambers murder trial said 
today that the jury though bogged down in circumstantial evidence 
could have reached a verdict 
i feel very firmly that we could have reached a verdict 
said juror cole wallace interviewed on abcs good morning 
america program 
we never reached a dead end said juror mike ognibene 
interviewed on the same program we were judging with a 
circumstantial case and there was a great deal of discretion 
involved in reaching the decision 
chambers agreed to plead guilty last friday to firstdegree 
manslaughter and an unrelated burglary charge to end his trial on 
murder charges in the death of jennifer dawn levin during a central 
park tryst the agreement followed nine days of deliberations and 
both the prosecution and defense feared a hung jury 
as part of the plea bargain chambers who had maintained since 
his arrest that he killed miss levin accidentally during a sexual 
encounter that turned rough acknowledged he intended to hurt the 
18yearold woman the night of her death 
chambers entered the rikers island jail saturday to await 
sentencing april 15 he faces a fiveto15year prison term for 
killing miss levin under the bargain 
we were shocked that thats how it ended juror ginny hoesl 
said of the plea bargain in an interview on cbs this morning 
she said chambers would have been convicted but it was impossible 
to say on what charge 
betsy shankin a friend of jennifer levins said on the same 
program that she would have preferred a jury verdict but was 
satisfied that chambers had to admit his guilt as part of his plea 
she wished for a longer sentence however saying i dont think 
it will ever be enough for him 
on sunday monsignor thomas leonard who helped counsel chambers 
after his arrest said chambers would issue a statement soon about 
the killing 
i think that he will make some sort of statement of how 
sorry he is for the trouble this has caused the levin family and 
for his own family he said 
in a separate development chambers lawyer jack litman 
ridiculed allegations by assistant district attorney linda 
fairstein that his client forged 7000 worth of stolen checks in 
october and used some of it to buy drugs 
the scandalous claims by the prosecutors are made in an 
obvious attempt to save face for having allowed robert chambers to 
receive a sentence in the range of reckless manslaughter when they 
proclaimed from the rooftop that robert chambers intentionally 
murdered jennifer levin he said saturday 
fairstein said she didnt want to provoke a mistrial by making 
the allegation public earlier 
as part of the plea bargain chambers is immune from prosecution 
from any other past crimes 
prosecutors had said that the burglary to which chambers pleaded 
guilty was committed to support his cocaine habit for which he was 
institutionalized twice

senate democrats failed again today to end 
debate on a bill that would require the government to notify 
100000 to 300000 workers a year that they risk cancer and other 
disabling diseases from exposure to toxic substances on the job 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said a fourth 
attempt at ending what some proponents of the legislation have 
branded as a republican filibuster will be made tuesday two 
attempts last week failed 
byrd indicated however that tomorrows move could be the last 
effort to force a final senate vote on the housepassed bill if its 
sponsors cannot muster the 60 votes necessary to limit further 
debate to 30 hours 
unlike ending a filibuster passage of a bill requires only a 
simple majority 51 votes if all 100 senators are present 
the 4144 vote today to cut off debate indicated that sens 
howard metzenbaum dohio and edward m kennedy dmass the 
chief authors of the bill had picked up only slight support by 
exempting farm workers and companies with less than 100 fulltime 
employees 
metzenbaum and hatch mustered 33 votes last week for ending a 
threat by sens orrin hatch rutah and dan quayle rind to 
prolong the debate indefinitely and prevent the senate from moving 
on to other measures 
a few southern democrats and liberal republicans who had voted 
with hatch and quayle last week voted with metzenbaum and kennedy 
today 
the bill would establish a panel of experts to identify the most 
hazardous substances in workplaces and the groups of employees most 
susceptible to disabling diseases because of exposure to them 
the national institute of occupational safety and health would 
be required to notify 100000 to 300000 of those workers every 
year at an annual cost of 25 million 
employers then would be required to finance medical monitoring 
program for them at a cost of up to 250 each annually 
if as a result of the monitoring a physician recommends 
transferring an employee to less hazardous work employers would 
have to pay the same level of wages and benefits to the worker in 
the new job in the event no other job is available the employee 
would be entitled to full wages and benefits for up to a year after 
leaving a job

in the occupied territories dec 8 one israeli soldier has been 
killed 
lapid said only pool press coverage will be allowed during the 
threeday period reporters will be accompanied by a military 
spokesman the official said

the people of the areas any reason for causing disturbances said 
a senior defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the measures were to take effect at 1 am tuesday on the west 
bank and 10 pm tonight in the gaza strip fivehour nightly 
curfews are already in effect in gaza 
israels 24member cabinet authorized the measures in its weekly

was calculated to lessen tensions wednesday when palestinians will 
mark land day the 12th anniversary of a 1976 clash between israeli 
soldiers and arabs over the confiscation of arab land six arabs 
were killed 
underground leaflets signed by the plo have called for major 
demonstrations throughout israel and the occupied territories to 
mark the occasion a traditional time of unrest in recent years 
israeli officials have maintained press coverage especially the 
presence of television cameras has incited palestinians to stage 
violent protests that might otherwise not have taken place 
robert slater head of the foreign press association in israel 
sharply protested the action and said the group was considering 
legal action 
we reject this as we have for the last four months slater 
told the associated press the foreign press stands united in its 
determination to cover this story in person and wherever the story 
takes us

army report and said troops used their presence as a pretext to 
raid the village another 14yearold arab boy also died in the 
clash

as saying shultz will have more meetings with ploaffiliated

ibrahim abu lughod both american citizens and members of the 
palestine national council the parliamentinexile of the 
palestine liberation organization 
israel has always refused to negotiate with the plo and israeli 
officials contend the shultz meeting violated a longstanding us 
commitment not to deal with the plo 
shamirs criticism of shultzs meeting speech came a day after 
ministers of the centerleft labor party told a stormy cabinet 
meeting visit that israel must adopt a us peace plan if it hopes 
to end violence in the occupied lands 
before his visit to the united states last week shamir had 
blocked any debate on the peace plan which involves israel giving 
land to the palestinians in exchange for peace

the state department which has restricted 
american travel to the west bank and gaza today said it regretted 
israels decision to seal off the territories for three days in 
expectation of major demonstrations called by the palestine 
liberation organization 
spokesman charles e redman said the israeli move would have an 
impact on commerce visits between family members and the press 
both israelis and arabs will be prevented from entering the two 
areas the only exception will be the 65000 jewish settlers who 
live in the territories 
a total of 119 palestinian arabs and an israeli soldier have 
died since violent protests broke out dec 9 the state department 
citing continuing disturbances last friday advised us 
citizens to avoid travel to the areas until further notice 
the warning also could have an impact on tourism and business 
especially during holy week

with the plo as well as negotiating or recognizing the group until 
it accepts israels right to exist and disavows terrorism 
the spokesman said secretary of state george p shultzs meeting 
here saturday with two american members of the palestine national 
council did not conflict with the 13yearold policy 
the council considers itself the legislative arm of the

the house on monday approved a bill that would 
make it easier for a parent to recover a child who is abducted and 
taken to a foreign country often by the other parent 
the measure passed by voice vote and sent to the senate would 
enable the us government to implement an international treaty 
intended to overcome complex timeconsuming legal issues blocking 
the prompt return of abducted children from a foreign country 
the united states signed the treaty in 1981 although it was 
approved by the senate in october 1986 the united states has not 
ratified the pact because the state department said implementing 
legislation was needed first 
the treaty provides for the prompt return of children abducted 
from their country or wrongfully kept in a foreign country and 
provides for visitation rights across international borders 
the bill provides for accelerated procedures by the courts of 
nine foreign countries that have ratified the treaty for returning 
abducted children to their us parents 
the bill would direct state courts when petitioned by foreign 
parents to order children returned to their habitual residence 
abroad even if there is no legal order establishing custody

gov evan mecham today lashed out at the 
prosecutor at his impeachment trial for comparing his use of a 
protocol fund to a bank officials embezzling money 
i resent so highly the word embezzlement in my presence the 
firstterm republican governor told prosecutor william french as 
french and presiding officer frank gordon jr tried to silence him 
im insulted by it mecham said i have seen no other 
witness who has been insulted as i have been 
however gordon admonished mecham against making his statement 
without being asked a question saying i hope sir that you 
believe that the rules are for you as well as everybody else 
mecham testifying as the impeachment trial entered its second 
month said he never tried to hide an 80000 loan from the 
governors protocol fund to his auto dealership from the public or 
from other business creditors 
the arizona senate is hearing evidence on three charges to 
determine whether the firstterm republican should be removed from 
office 
mecham argued that the loan was legitimate saying a loan is 
one thing and an expenditure is much much different he 
contended he also could have legally borrowed the money to buy 
himself a car and he also could have loaned the money to his wife 
as long as she paid it back 
french asked mecham whether a bank officer could avoid 
embezzlement charges if he borrowed bank funds as long as he paid 
it back that question led to the governors outburst 
the governor also testified today that he thought somebody must 
have been monitoring his telephone calls for the prosecutor to 
learn that he phoned a witness 
but french said that the witness told a member of the 
prosecution staff about the call 
mechams former chief of staff jim colter initially testified 
about the matter tuesday when he returned to the stand the next 
morning he testified under questioning from french that he had 
gotten a call on his answering machine from the governor saying 
that i had done a good job or something to that effect 
today the governor said there was no intention to contact 
jim adding that he was shocked that french found out about 
the call 
the governor said he had made the call to inquire about colters 
health and to say he looked well 
somebody had to be monitoring my phone calls to ever know 
that i couldnt figure out any other reason mr french that 
you would know about the call said mecham who once said he 
feared laser beams were being used to eavesdrop on his office 
thats just an assumption on my part the governor added 
french then asked the governor if he would be surprised if 
colter had told a member of frenchs staff about the call 
yes that would surprise me but if you tell me that ill 
accept it the governor said 
the senate already has heard testimony on a charge that mecham 
tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a 
state official 
the third impeachment charge accuses him of concealing a 
350000 campaign loan the governor also faces an april 21 
criminal trial on six felony counts related to the loan 
the senate could decide this week to vote on the first two 
allegations without hearing the third a conviction would 
automatically remove mecham from office although the trial could 
continue on the third charge to decide if the governor should be 
barred from holding future public office 
the senate last week dropped a proposal to allow a vote after 
the first count and some senators predicted the same would happen 
this week 
i imagine there will be more votes for it but i doubt there 
will be enough majority leader bob usdane said sunday he added 
there is a chance the trial might not end before a may 17 recall 
election as some senators want 
fellow republican sen greg lunn said senators should hear all 
the evidence before voting whether to convict mecham 
however minority leader alan stephens a democrat said sunday 
there was a danger that hearing testimony in the senate on the 
350000 loan charge might make it impossible to empanel an 
impartial jury in criminal court in that case he said we look 
pretty bad 
a twothirds senate margin would be required to change the rules 
and allow an early vote 
on friday mecham testified that he was told by fundraiser bill 
long he could spend the protocol fund for any damn thing you 
want those are his words except you cant spend it for 
politics or for personal living expenses 
long submitted an affidavit friday contending that he never 
intended to turn the inaugural proceeds into state funds and that 
he believed they were being turned over to mecham for his personal 
use 
the prosecution contends the protocol fund created with 
proceeds from inaugural fundraising events became public money 
when it was turned over to the governors office mecham pontiac 
needed the 80000 loan to meet its july payroll according to 
prosecution testimony 
however the defense contends mecham pontiac was in good shape 
and that the protocol fund was private money that mecham could use 
as he saw fit except for personal living expenses or to retire his 
campaign debt 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required to convict 
mecham who is the first us governor to be impeached in six 
decades

south african soldiers raided a house 
on the outskirts of this border capital early monday killing a man 
and three women during an hourlong gun battle 
the south african defense force claimed responsibility in a 
statement issued in pretoria 10 hours after the attack ended about 
2 am 
it described the victims as terrorists of the african 
national congress the main guerrilla group fighting white 
domination in south africa 
both the united states and javier perez de cuellar the un 
secretarygeneral condemned the raid state department spokesman 
charles redman said it appears the south african authorities 
made no attempt to seek the cooperation of the botswana authorities 
in dealing with the alleged security threat 
in gaborone president quett masires office said the man was 
south african two women were botswanans and the third woman had 
not been identified 
according to the statement all were sleeping when the south 
africans attacked at 1 am in an area of the phiring suburb called 
tsholofelo 
the office of the president strongly condemns this dastardly 
attack and murder of innocent people in botswana by the south 
african army it said south africas problems cannot be 
resolved by attacking neighboring countries such as botswana 
botswana strongly urges the south african government to engage 
in meaningful negotiations with the genuine leadership of the 
oppressed majority in that country the statement said 
south africas 5 million whites control the government and 
economy and the 26 million blacks have no voice in national 
affairs 
the statement from the south african military called the raid a 
followup to a shootout near the border with botswana on friday 
which had not been reported previously in that attack soldiers 
killed three suspected terrorists in a running battle near a 
farm capturing rifles machine pistols and hand grenades the 
statement said 
following up on intelligence gathered during fridays 
operation an element of the defense force killed four more 
terrorists on the northern outskirts of gaborone early today 
it said 
mondays raid provides further evidence that anc terrorists 
originating from zambia and zimbabwe use botswana as a transit 
route to infiltrate into south africa it said 
defense minister magnas malan said the preemptive raid 
resulted in the prevention of killings and maimings of innocent 
people at a later stage 
a dispatch from the botswana press association quoted norman 
moleboge the deputy police commissioner as saying the four 
victims were shot and set afire and gasoline containers were found 
at the scene it said an explosion may have been caused by a gas 
cylinder in the house 
neighbors said they heard sporadic fire from automatic weapons 
and possibly grenade explosions they reported seeing people flee 
in a vehicle and others run into the bush two said the raiders 
left in a helicopter 
one witness said a woman ran from the house and sought shelter 
in his home 
south africa has issued several threats to botswana in the past 
few months accusing it of harboring african national congress 
guerrillas 
masires government supports anc goals and allows its 
representatives in the country but says it does not permit 
guerrillas to attack south africa from botswanas territory 
the south african military has raided alleged guerrilla hideouts 
in botswana several times in recent years one person was killed in 
an attack in may 1986 and a raid in june 1985 left 15 dead

three cabinet officers unveiled a guide to 
workplace literacy monday that includes tips for businesses to 
learn just how well or poorly their workers read 
the three officials labor secretary ann mclaughlin education 
secretary william j bennett and commerce secretary c william 
verity all agreed that bolstering the basic skills of workers is 
essentially to maintaining a strong economy 
the education and labor departments published the 50page 
guidebook the bottom line basic skills in the workplace 
it was verity who provided the most gripping example of problems 
which companies face with illiteracy in the workforce 
basic workplace literacy is an absolute necessity if we are to 
increase our productivity remain competitive in the global 
marketplace and continue to be a world leader verity said 
he said he had learned of one company that wanted to hire 100 
people for two shifts at a new stateoftheart plant but had 
trouble finding workers capable of performing fifthgrade math and 
seventhgrade in english 
verity who declined to identify the company said a test was 
given to 480 people who applied and only 49 of them passed the 
company offered to send those who flunked to an eightweek remedial 
course at a community college and 50 of the 100 people who took 
the course passed the companys test on a second try 
verity said the real problem is that schools should be improved 
so that all high school graduates at least have the equivalent of 
a seventhgrade education in english and a fifthgrade education in 
math which is sort of the norm for getting a job in industry 
hopefully as time goes on those levels will rise and well have a 
much better workforce coming out of the school system 
the bottom line guidebook outlines how to identify 
employees basic skills and how to improve them it spells out how 
to conduct a literacy audit to determine what skills a worker 
needs to carry out a given task and offers suggestions of actual 
programs that have proven successful 
mclaughlin said 75 percent of the us workforce for the year 
2000 are already out of school many of these workers are 
illprepared to deal with rapidly changing technology because they 
lack adequate basic skills she said clearly business must 
take a lead role in remedying the basic skills gap for these 
workers 
she cited estimates that up to 23 million american adults lack 
the basic skills needed to hold a job 
bennett said unfortunately there are still too many people 
who graduate from our high schools with a diploma but without the 
necessary skills 
our job doesnt stop with the schools and thats where this 
book comes in said bennett 
mclaughlin said it was an interesting liaison between the 
three cabinet officers but noting that it was their first joint 
appearance she said maybe were not quite getting the act 
together 
bennett quipped its our first but not our last peter paul 
and mary look out

jesse jackson says he can win wisconsins 
pivotal democratic primary because ive stood here with the meat 
packers in cudahy the auto workers in kenosha and the paper 
workers in de pere 
from iowas bankrupt farmers to laidoff appliance workers in 
illinois jackson has stood sidebyside with the nations 
displaced and disaffected and in the process forged a winning 
coalition 
jacksons campaign for economic justice has touched a chord 
and it may be enough to deliver another victory over michael 
dukakis in wisconsin next tuesday aides to both candidates said 
monday 
support from bluecollar workers is crucial to jacksons chances 
in wisconsin since jacksons core black constituency makes up only 
3 percent of the states population jackson consistently carries 
about 10 percent of the white vote but has moved beyond that in 
some states notably in heavilywhite vermont earlier this month 
and on saturday in michigan where he won some predominantly white 
areas on top of black detroit wards 
tony tsakakis a national campaign aide to massachusetts gov 
dukakis said wisconsin is a twoman race even though he feels 
dukakis will win tsakakis said he could not rule out a jackson 
victory 
its going to be the reverand and us through the convention 
said tsakakis 
bob burns a member of jacksons national staff working in 
wisconsin said jackson would rely heavily on labor support in a 
push to win wisconsin 
in every race where we have competed we felt we would come in 
no 1 or no 2 and wisconsin is no different burns said 
both men referred to a milwaukee sentinel poll released monday 
that showed dukakis leading jackson 28 percent to 25 percent among 
likely democratic voters 
the poll was conducted march 1722 before jacksons weekend win 
in michigan 
it is not a measure of our newfound momentum as our 
rockbottom strength burns said 
even republican gov tommy thompson a supporter of vice 
president george bush said monday if he were a democrat he would 
vote for jackson 
under wisconsins open primary thompson legally could take a 
democratic ballot but does not plan to do so 
just because he is a democrat doesnt mean i cant like him 
said thompson who joined jackson earlier this month in kenosha to 
protest plans by chrysler corp to close an auto plant there a 
move that will throw 5500 people out of work 
it is those auto workers in kenosha strikers at the patrick 
cudahy meat packing plant in cudahy and striking paper workers in 
de pere that jackson is depending on to help him carry wisconsin 
as he has done in other states 
the day after super tuesday jackson was in the chicago suburbs 
of cicero where workers were worried about the planned closing of a 
general electric plant thtat makes hotpoint refrigerators jackson 
was met under dreary damp skies by a rally of about 200 people 
organized by the sheet metal workers union they carried signs that 
said jesse help us save our jobs and unemployment made by 
ge 
workers said they believed jackson would make a difference for 
them 
nothing has changed here ive been working here 23 years i 
believe jackson would make a change said mack fundes 
phil haney a kenosha auto worker who came to milwaukee on 
saturday to see jackson said he felt the same way 
hes been on the picket lines haney said 
haney said if jackson were president he would expect him to 
push for legislation to promote more business investment at home 
and help for workers displaced by plant closings and new 
technologies

police in west germany and switzerland 
seized 11 people suspected of spying for the soviet union in a 
crackdown that was termed a major blow to the kgb authorities said 
monday 
interior minister friedrich zimmermann said the arrests showed 
that soviet bloc spy networks were redoubling undercover work in 
the west despite improved superpower relations 
west germanys counterintelligence agents have dealt a serious 
blow to eastern espionage agencies zimmermann said in a 
statement 
the large number of arrests confirms that instead of 
refraining from activating agents in a time of political detente 
between east and west the east bloc is intensifying the illegal 
activities of its operatives he added 
security sources said the arrests were made during a series of 
police raids last week federal prosecutor kurt rebmann said they 
marked an important penetration of the kgb spy network in west 
germany 
an foreign engineer living in zurich was arrested wednesday on a 
tip from west germany swiss prosecutors said they did not 
disclose his name or nationality but said they had launched a 
criminal investigation into his activities 
spy scandals and arrests are frequent in west germany a 
frontline nato ally and one of western europes most 
technologically advanced nations 
in the last major espionage scandal 15 communist agents were 
arrested or disappeared between august and december 1985 
rebmann said 10 people were taken into custody wednesday and 
thursday as part of a nationwide crackdown against espionage 
targets the raids were carried out by 169 police officers in 33 
locations according to rebmann 
he said six of the 10 taken into custody remained in jail on 
monday and that investigations were continuing against the four 
who were released 
in addition inquiries were under way against 14 other espionage 
suspects for a total of 24 separate investigations the prosecutor 
said he declined to say how many of the cases were likely to 
result in charges 
he said those in custody included two teachers three engineers 
and a businessman all of whom are suspected of working for the 
kgb three were soviet emigres living in west germany 
one suspect businessman helmut stefan kolasch is believed to 
have worked for the kgb since 1971 rebmann said kolasch 44 
allegedly gave the kgb technological secrets about natos tornado 
and jaeger warplanes while working for firms dealing with the 
aircraft he said 
rebmann identified the other jailed suspects as peter friesen 
33 an engineer george bender 37 also an engineer shimon or 
48 a teacher edmund neufert 37 another teacher another 
suspect a colombian engineer was identified by rebmann only as 
amaya 
the prosecutor said all six were living in west germany 
rebmann said amaya also handed over unidentified technical 
documents to the kgb friesen spied on west german political 
parties bender reported to the kgb about a large electronics 
concern he worked for and neufert spied on students while 
teaching russian at the foreign ministrys languagetraining office 
rebmann said or reported to the kgb on his own life and 
work but he did not provide details 
none of the suspected spies apparently knew one another and were 
operating individually the prosecutor told reporters 
the police raids followed the march 18 arrest of a government 
secretary who was also suspected of having worked for the kgb elke 
falk worked in several government ministries in the past decade and 
had access to classified information

thousands of armenians in a disputed region of the 
caucasus stayed away from factories and schools monday to protest 
the kremlins refusal to make the area part of the armenian 
republic 
groups of young men blocked pedestrians and busloads of workers 
from reporting to their jobs in stepanakert the main city of the 
nagornokarabakh region the government newspaper izvestia 
reported it said authorities used mobile loudspeakers and leaflets 
to urge an end to the strike 
the statecontrolled media said the ethnic unrest was damaging 
the regions economy 
about threequarters of the 157000 residents of 
nagornokarabakh which has been part of neighboring azerbaijan 
since 1923 are ethnic armenians 
the official radio in baku capital of azerbaijan said 
extremely fanatical elements incited disturbances saturday 
evening in nagornokarabakh 
it did not describe the disturbances or say exactly where they 
occurred in the disputed territory the british broadcasting corp 
monitored the broadcast in london 
sporadic strikes and protests have been reported in 
nagornokarabakh since feb 13 the latest labor trouble is said to 
have begun wednesday after moscow refused armenian demands to annex 
the region about the size of delaware 
in a telephone conversation the manager of stepanakerts only 
hotel the karabakh said all but essential services were halted 
the bread and milk plants are working the others are not 
everyone is sitting at home he said 
about 30 percent of public transport was shut down in 
stepanakert a city of about 33000 the manager reported he 
described himself as an ethnic armenian but would not give his name 
an izvestia dispatch from stepanakert said workers stayed away 
from factories producing silk shoes and electronic goods students 
boycotted the teachers college and mothers kept their children 
home from kindergarten 
azeris the dominant ethnic group in azerbaijan also were 
caught up in the trouble it said 
ethnic azeri workers arrived at the entrances to their 
businesses but announced unless the armenians come we will 
not work izvestia reported 
communist party officials in stepanakert called workers to 
weekend meetings and urged them to resume their jobs the 
government paper said appeals distributed by leaflets and 
broadcasts monday said the city owed the government seven million 
rubles 112 million in lost revenue 
the hotel manager said party meetings continued monday he 
predicted the strike would end tuesday but sergei grigoryants a 
moscow human rights activist who is half armenian said it was 
scheduled to run through friday 
pravda the national party daily said monday the difficult 
state of affairs in nagornokarabakh had damaged the economy of 
azerbaijan as a whole 
losses to the automotive and transport industries were the 
equivalent of about 24 million in february and march and the 
railway industry lost about 120000 the paper said 
it revealed little about how the money was lost but quoted a 
railway official in azerbaijan as saying freight cars had not been 
unloaded the official garik sarkisyan said the situation was 
thoroughly bad and loss of time and money has become the 
usual thing 
there were no strikes or protests monday in yerevan capital of 
armenia according to an armenian interior ministry official a 
hotel executive and armenian nationalist hovik vassilian all 
interviewed by telephone 
izvestia said however that at least one yerevan factory was 
having trouble getting supplies from sumgait a city in azerbaijan 
on the caspian sea north of baku where at least 32 people were 
killed in ethnic riots feb 28 
a vanassembly plant in yerevan sent trucks to sumgait for side 
windows but were not allowed into the city izvestia said it did 
not make clear who barred the truck or why 
moscow dissidents in touch with armenian sources over the 
weekend described yerevan as a dead city people stayed home to 
protest a crackdown on demonstrations that had been planned for 
saturday they said 
on wednesday the government announced a plan for improving 
social and economic conditions in nagornokarabakh but it does not 
include annexation to armenia 
on monday pravda said the improvements hinge on whether the 
strike ends 
any most realistic and wellconsidered program cannot be 
implemented if people do not come to feel a high personal 
responsibility for the destiny and development of the area and do 
not get down to work it said the machine tools should not 
stay idle railway cars should continue to be unloaded and field 
work should go on

the state department criticized israel on 
monday for sealing off the west bank and gaza for three days in 
expectation of major demonstrations called by the palestine 
liberation organization 
we regret the decision because of the impact it will have on 
commerce on visits with family members and the press spokesman 
charles e redman said 
last friday the department advised us citizens to avoid 
travel to the areas because of continuing disturbances this also 
was likely to affect local business because tourists are attracted 
to the west bank during holy week 
israels decision will keep israelis and arabs from entering the 
territories the only exceptions will be the 65000 jewish settlers 
who live there among 15 million palestinian arabs 
a total of 119 palestinians and an israeli soldier have died 
since violent protests broke out in the west bank and gaza on dec 
9 secretary of state george p shultz will launch a new drive in 
jerusalem on sunday to hold negotiations for palestinian selfrule 
beginning may 1 
he plans two stops in israel and in jordan the two key 
countries and also stops in syria saudi arabia and egypt 
spokesman redman said shultz would like to meet with palestinians 
while he is in the region 
on tuesday he is scheduled to meet here with representatives of 
the arab league which is a group of the 21 arab countries and the 
plo 
shultz will leave washington on thursday and spend more than two 
days in rome meeting with italian officials and attending religious 
services 
redman reaffirmed meanwhile that us policy prohibits 
dealing with the plo as well as negotiating or recognizing the 
group until it accepts israels right to exist and disavows 
terrorism 
the spokesman said shultzs meeting here saturday with two 
american members of the palestine national council did not conflict 
with the 13yearold policy which also was written into law in 
1984 
the council considers itself the legislative arm of the 
palestinian nationalist movement one of the two 
palestinianamericans edward said said he informed plo chairman 
yasser arafat before he and ibrahim abulughod met with shultz and 
arafat approved 
israel protested the meeting 
redman said the plo and the council were not synonymous and 
that our restrictions on dealing with the plo remain as always 
the spokesman said shultzs meeting with said and abulughod 
who are university professors was not a negotiating format 
shultz presented his proposal for negotiations to arab and 
israeli leaders four weeks ago and asked for a reply by midmarch 
so far only egypt has endorsed his plan 
still redman said the proposal was under serious and active 
consideration by the parties he said shultz would emphasize the 
plan was a fair and balanced approach to the 40year arabisraeli 
dispute 
nobody has said no redman said we are going to continue 
to work on this proposal to see if we cant get something going 
asked about a report that shultz would take with him an 
invitation to a united nations conference on the middle east to 
begin april 15 the spokesman said it sounds pretty flaky

a los angeles home to live in after the president leaves office in 
january but will lease rather than buy the 25 million estate 
the white house said monday 
elaine crispen press secretary to first lady nancy reagan said 
the reagans signed a lease and mailed it within the last 10 days 
the estate in the luxurious bel air district is owned by wall 
management services a group of about 20 friends of the reagans who 
bought it with them in mind 
the threeyear agreement gives the reagans the option to renew 
the lease or purchase the property the estate includes 1 acres of 
grounds and a secluded house with 6500 feet of living space and a 
pool 
wall management bought the estate on aug 21 1986 from a 
90yearold woman who the investors said would lease it back from 
them until the reagans were ready for it 
mrs crispen said the previous owner has since died 
the spokeswoman said she did not know the amount of the lease 
payments she said the lease agreement was worked out by the 
reagans lawyers the white house counsels office and the office 
of government ethics 
the reagans money is in a blind trust 
the reagans lived in pacific palisades in the western part of 
los angeles before his election as president that house has since

the soviet union has stepped up its aerial 
reconnaissance patrols along the entire asian coastline and is 
becoming more aggressive in sending up fighters to meet american 
patrol planes the head of the us pacific fleet said monday 
while it is difficult to know for sure the increased activity 
may reflect the aftermath of the mathias rust affair in which a 
west german teenager managed to fly a small plane past soviet air 
defenses to moscows red square said adm david e jeremiah 
rusts success prompted a shakeup of the soviet military 
hierarchy 
the fourstar admiral who took command of the pacific fleet 
last october also confirmed previous reports that the united 
states would conduct naval exercises off the korean peninsula 
during this summers olympic games 
he also argued that congress in debating whether some older 
navy carriers should be retired soon should not disturb the 
current practice of basing a carrier in japan and he declared the 
most important concern of military commanders in the pacific to be 
the situation in the philippines and continued access to us bases 
there 
the 54yearold jeremiah met for more than 45 minutes with 
pentagon reporters monday to discuss developments within a military 
theater that is by far the navys largest stretching from the 
west coast to africa 
jeremiah said the soviets had become much more aggressive in 
recent months in meeting us aircraft over the pacific 
particularly in scrambling mig23 jet fighters out of a base in cam 
rahn bay vietnam and from soviet bases above the sea of japan 
i think youre seeing a pattern that reflects the rust 
incident jeremiah continued 
thats what the reaction is the soviets military obviously 
got jacked around pretty hard after that penetration of their air 
space the soviet aviation forces have been much more 
aggressive in reconnaissance flights around the sea of japan and 
offshore off japan some of them over north korea and down to cam 
rahn bay and into the south china sea 
the activity rate is higher than it was in times past he 
said 
addressing the large russian naval base at cam rahn bay 
jeremiah said the soviets did not appear to be engaged in any major 
construction projects at the moment but he added the base is now 
substantially larger than when it was used by the united states 
during the vietnam war 
the admiral refused to offer many details on us plans for 
naval exercises during the summer olympics beyond saying the 
aircraft carrier midway and a battle group would maintain a 
fairly continuous presence through the period 
pentagon sources disclosed last month the exercises would be 
staged to let north korea know that were watching them and 
nothing should be done to disrupt the olympic games in south korea 
jeremiah described the midway the only us aircraft carrier 
based outside the united states as an essential part of americas 
forward defenses in that part of the world 
while the midway itself has become the object of proposed budget 
cuts it would absolutely have to be replaced with another 
carrier he said 
if anything is done to change the composition of the carrier 
force then this country should be careful to do it in a prudent 
way that allows us to get all of the pieces put together in 
sequence so that we dont disturb relationships with our host 
nations jeremiah added

rep richard gephardt quit the democratic presidential race 
today a victim of mounting losses in the seven weeks since he won 
the leadoff iowa caucuses rival jesse jackson on the rise with a 
victory in michigan said he expects the party to embrace him as 
its nominee if he wins the most preconvention delegates 
gephardt who declared his candidacy in february 1987 and 
actually began campaigning more than a year earlier said at a 
capitol hill news conference its time to end a presidential 
campaign 
he said he would file for reelection to his house seat on 
tuesday to continue my fight for the people whose concerns have 
been at the heart of this campaign 
the missouri congressman noted that it is often said that an 
opera isnt over until the fat lady sings referring to his 
distant thirdplace finish in the michigan caucuses he said 
last saturday in michigan i think i heard her walking to the 
microphone 
he ranked fourth among the democratic contenders in delegates to 
the national convention 
on the eve of tuesdays connecticut primary vice president 
george bush who grew up in that state and is heavily favored to 
win set off today on a threeday wisconsin campaign swing 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bushs onetime foe jack kemp endorsed the vice president 
saying george bush is going to be the nominee of the republican 
party and he has earned that nomination kemp said the gop must 
rally around bush to avoid a democratic win in november which he 
said would lead to a decline every bit as steep and severe as 
under jimmy carter 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bush the overwhelming gop frontrunner wasnt likely to run 
into either of his remaining rivals in wisconsin which holds its 
primary a week from tuesday bob dole who has all but conceded the 
nomination was in washington today giving a speech on the future 
of the republican party and pat robertson was taking a weeklong 
vacation 
jackson on abctvs good morning america said today if 
at the end of california we have the most popular votes and the 
most delegate votes becoming the nominee is logical and proper 
he questioned the idea that party leaders might ignore his 
delegate strength at the convention and give the nomination to 
another democratic candidate 
they would not have given me the nomination i would have 
earned it from the people jackson said there is no small 
group no electoral college that can give if so why even have 
a primary why not just let the small group choose candidates in 
the first place 
i dont believe in collecting a group of favorite sons and 
then selecting one the people elect whats left he said 
jackson said if he wins the nomination through the democratic 
process i expect the party to embrace me and to embrace those 
principles 
rival michael dukakis was seeking to come back with a win on his 
new england home turf jackson was campaigning in connecticut again 
today but dukakis the governor of neighboring massachusetts has 
won every state in new england so far and was expected to do well 
in the state 
with returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in michigan 
jackson had 55 percent to 28 percent for dukakis gephardt had 13 
percent sen paul simon had 2 percent as did sen albert gore jr 
the remaining returns were expected later today 
the michigan victory put jackson within striking distance of 
dukakis in the national delegate count although the massachusetts 
governor still clung to a narrow lead the latest ap delegate count 
put dukakis at 60355 to jacksons 59755 tennessee sen albert 
gore jr had 3628 sen paul simon 1715 gephardt 167 and 
uncommitted 3626 
some of the democratic candidates were gathering for a forum in 
new york tonight but dukakis was not expected and gephardt might 
not be a candidate by then 
dukakis who before michigan had been seeking to position 
himself as the inevitable democratic nominee was talking instead 
about a long fight to the finish 
this race is only half over he said sunday at a greek 
festival in new haven anyone that thinks that this race is over 
or even that its narrowed down to a twoperson or a threeperson 
race doesnt understand the unpredictability of american politics 
there are no frontrunners 
that was fine by gore and simon the tennessee senator was in 
connecticut on sunday suggesting dukakis disappointing finish 
kept the race wide open to his benefit 
were building momentum steadily were gaining speed 
gore said after a speech at an italianamerican club in the 
industrial city of derby this race has a long way to go it is 
wide open even more so after the results in michigan 
simon also suggested as he has for some time that the race 
was still fluid and no nominee would emerge before the democratic 
national convention in july the illinois senator who came away 
with only 2 percent of the vote in michigan has said he needs a 
strong showing in wisconsin to carry on 
a statewide poll in todays milwaukee sentinel suggested jackson 
and dukakis were in a dead heat in the state 
another poll suggested dukakis was the clear favorite in new 
york which holds its primary on april 19 
the weekend wasnt a complete loss for dukakis he won precinct 
caucuses in north dakota and he edged out gephardt in iowas 
county conventions the latest step in that states complicated 
delegateselection process

richard gephardt who fell short of the 
michigan miracle he needed to revive his candidacy quit the 
race for the democratic nomination today but said our effort was 
not in vain 
departing at an announcement on capitol hill gephardt continued 
the populist antiestablishment flavor that he used on the stump 
i believe that our effort was not in vain that we challenged 
the democratic party and and called it back to its central role as 
an agent of fundamental change he said 
gephardt also updated the line that became the populist slogan 
of his campaign its your fight too 
whether the issue is trade or social security contra aid or 
the environment tax justice or corporate responsibility your 
fight will always be my fight too gephardt said 
gephardts candidacy limped out of the south on super tuesday 
three weeks ago having never received the beneficial momentum he 
had expected from iowa 
gephardt had looked to michigans caucuses last saturday 
figuring that autoindustry state would provide a most receptive 
ear for his call for trade retaliation against countries that dont 
open markets to us products 
he asked for a michigan miracle instead he got a distant 
third place finish behind jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
its been said the opera isnt over until the fat lady 
sings gephardt said last saturday in michigan i think i heard 
her walking to the microphone 
gephardts campaign blossomed in the leadoff delegate event 
iowas caucuses where his tough talk on trade caught on with the 
states democrats he won again in south dakota but on super 
tuesday he failed to win anywhere other than his home state of 
missouri 
gephardt said he would file for reelection to his house seat 
from missouri i hope to carry their cause as a member of 
congress and tomorrow im filing for reelection he said 
aides said gephardt did not intend to try to preserve the 
delegates he had already won as a bloc by continuing his campaign 
in a suspended state 
he spent sunday at home in seclusion at his suburban virginia 
with family and advisers aides were silent about what went on but 
as early as last week they had said privately that he would drop 
out if he didnt make a strong showing in michigans democratic 
caucuses he finished a distant third in saturdays contest 
going into michigan gephardt indicated it was a doordie state 
for him but said he believed his prospects were good michigan is 
an industrial and union state that offered as receptive an audience 
for his tough talk on trade as gephardt was likely to find anywhere 
gephardts last campaign speech was in milwaukee before 
wisconsin democrats who vote next tuesday he delivered it as the 
size of his michigan defeat was becoming clear 
all things considered id rather be back in des moines 
said gephardt who won iowas leadoff caucuses but was unable to 
convert that into victories in other states aside from his own 
missouri and in south dakota 
even in iowa gephardts candidacy was slipping away 
at county conventions there over the weekend followups to the 
precinct caucuses in february gephardt lost supporters to dukakis 
and jesse jackson gained ground as well 
i think people see that gephardt is pretty much out of it 
said tom mann a state senator from des moines who backed jackson 
gephardt had won 167 delegates through 31 contests falling 
behind even sen paul simon who was not a factor on super tuesday 
and only stayed in the race because he won his home state of 
illinois 
his delegates where people have actually been selected to fill 
those slots would become free to do as they wished if gephardt 
pulled out of the race in states where no people had been selected 
yet to fill delegate slots won by gephardt his delegate share 
would be reallocated among the other candidates depending on state 
rules 
gephardt surged to the top of the democratic field in iowa with 
savvy television ads and a tough pointed campaign message blaming 
unfair trade practices for much of the nations economic difficulty 
but his win in the iowa caucuses feb 8 didnt provide the 
bounce that he hoped for in the states that followed 
gephardt got very little momentum out of iowa said 
democratic party professional elaine kamarck pat robertsons 
surprise secondplace finish over george bush on the republican 
side dominated the news 
gephardt lost everywhere on super tuesday except for a 
homesstate win in missouri he was pounded across the south in a 
withering crossfire of negative television ads by both dukakis and 
sen albert gore jr 
gephardt delivered strongly stated populist antiestablishment 
themes but his message had a fundamental negativism to it at 
every speech he declared that america was in decline 
his depiction of himself as battling the establishment also 
brought an undercutting skepticism from those who knew him as the 
consummate washington insider some critics called his message 
pseudopopulism 
when he tried to resuscitate his campaign in the northern 
industrial states organized labor did not provide backing a day 
before michigans caucuses he asked uaw members at a rally in 
flint to deliver a michigan miracle 
but the uaw in michigan was splintered with many of the 
rankandfile members backing jackson when uaw president owen 
bieber appeared with gephardt two days before that states 
caucuses his unwillingness to offer an endorsement underscored 
gephardts problem 
gephardt formally declared his candidacy on feb 23 1987 but 
he had begun campaigning more than a year earlier

state and local governments increasingly are 
considering whether men and women should be paid the same for jobs 
that are different but of similar value to an employer according 
to a private study released monday 
the survey by the national committee on pay equity said more 
than 1500 local governments school districts and community 
colleges have taken steps to identify or eliminate race or sex bias 
in the wages of civil service employees 
cities counties and school districts in 24 states and the 
district of columbia have taken some action to address the issue of 
pay equity the report said 
americans are rejecting compensation systems that unfairly 
penalize women and people of color eileen m stein chairwoman 
of the washingtonbased coalition of womens labor and civil 
rights groups said in a statement accompanying the report 
it is indisputable that pay equity is taking hold at the local 
and state levels she said employer by employer jurisdiction 
by jurisdiction race and sex discrimination will be removed as 
wage determinants 
pay equity also known as comparable worth is the concept of 
paying men and women similar wages for different jobs judged to be 
of equal value to an employer supporters of the concept say action 
is needed to offset historical discrimination that has depressed 
wages in job fields dominated by women such as teaching nursing 
and clerical work 
opponents say it is impossible to compare jobs as disparate as 
say nursing and truck driving 
stein pointed to recent victories for pay equity proponents 
such as the 35 million decision by the city of san francisco last 
march to give 12000 city and school employees raises of 750 to 
2000 a year over two years 
the city acted after its civil service commission found that 
female and minority municipal workers were paid an average of 42 
percent less than their male counterparts in similar jobs 
the year before washington state adjusted the wages of about 
35000 state workers in a program that could cost about 482 
million through 1992 
stein also said los angeles chicago seattle colorado springs 
colo west hartford conn ann arbor mich spokane wash 
sioux city iowa palo alto calif long beach calif green bay 
wis virginia beach va and burlington vt have made pay 
equity adjustments 
pay equity proponents in congress have been unsuccesful so far 
in attempts to pass legislation requiring the government to study 
its wage and job classification systems for possible discrimination 
to date no federal appeals court has ruled that employers must 
pay similar salaries to workers in jobs of comparable worth 
although some employers are undertaking such salary revisions on 
their own

more than a million workers halted 
public transport and closed many businesses monday in a 24hour 
general strike against a government labor proposal 
the walkout also disrupted international flights closed banks 
and brought factories to a standstill union leaders said the 
strike aimed at a bill which they say would give employers too 
much power to fire workers was the countrys biggest ever 
jose torres couto head of the socialistled general workers 
union said between 175 million and 2 million workers went on 
strike his union called the walkout 
the labor ministry said the figures were exaggerated 
prime minister anibal cavaco silva said most of the country went 
to work as normal with the exception of the stateowned public 
transport sector where union militancy is high 
the general workers union is dominant among whitecollar 
workers the communist cgtp stongest among bluecollar workers 
supported the strike the first time it has backed industrial 
action by the socialist union 
opposition parties do not have the strength to defeat the 
governments labor bill in parliament but union leaders have 
expressed the hope that president mario soares will veto it 
soares whose election two years ago was strongly supported by 
the unions could use his veto to delay the legislation but could 
not overturn it altogether he has not said what he will do 
however the prime minister said monday his social democrat 
centerright government wont change a word of the bill

supporters of a bill to warn as many as 
300000 workers a year that they risk cancer or other diseases from 
job exposure to toxic chemicals failed monday on a third attempt to 
stop a republican filibuster 
sens howard metzenbaum dohio and edward m kennedy dmass 
the chief sponsors of the unionsought legislation mustered only 
41 of the 60 votes needed to end debate and force a vote on the 
measure itself 
the bill is aimed at addressing what the national institute of 
occupational safety and health estimates is one in every four 
americans who has been exposed to carcinogens at work most of them 
unaware of it 
this bill is about people getting cancer in the workplace and 
learning about it too late to do anything about it metzenbaum 
said the american cancer society estimates we can save 250000 
lives in the next 10 years by implementing it 
a fourth and possibly final attempt at ending the filibuster is 
scheduled tuesday supporters of the bill believe if they get 
another 14 or 15 votes then they can prevent senate majority 
leader robert c byrd dwva from giving up on the effort to win 
its passage this year 
a virtually identical measure was passed by the house on a 
225186 vote last november administration officials have said they 
would urge president reagan to veto if it reaches his desk 
although the filibuster primarily is the work of republican 
sens orrin hatch of utah and dan quayle of indiana a small group 
of southern democrats who want to avoid a showdown vote are helping 
keep it alive 
metzenbaum and kennedy were able to get just 33 votes last week 
for ending the filibuster at least one southern democrat and a few 
liberal republicans who had voted with hatch and quayle last week 
voted with metzenbaum and kennedy on monday 
the bill would establish a panel of seven scientific experts to 
identify the most hazardous substances in workplaces and the groups 
of employees most susceptible to disabling diseases because of 
exposure to them 
the national institute of occupational safety and health would 
be required to notify between 100000 and 300000 of those workers 
every year at an annual cost of 25 million employers then would 
be required to finance medical monitoring programs for them at a 
cost of up to 250 each annually 
if a physician recommends transferring a monitored employee to 
less hazardous work he or she would have to be paid the same level 
of wages and benefits to them in the new job if no other job is 
available the employee is entitled to full wages for up to a year 
after leaving work 
in addition to unions the bill is supported by public health 
groups the chemical and electronic industries and several major 
companies most of which have instituted such notification programs 
on their own 
however it is opposed by small businesses and large trade 
associations such as the national association of manufacturers and 
the us chamber of commerce which claim the bill would expose 
companies to liability suits from current and former employees 
if this bill passes there is going to be a liability crisis 
in this country like weve never seen before hatch said 
youre going to have billions and billions of dollars in 
lawsuits

jesse jackson poked fun at his 
betterfinanced democratic presidential rivals on monday and urged 
voters to catch the fever of hope and join his own rising white 
house campaign 
jackson who scored a landslide victory over michael dukakis in 
the michigan caucuses on saturday is far behind in the polls in 
advance of tuesdays contest in connecticut 
but he is in a neckandneck race with dukakis in the associated 
press national delegate count and has received more votes in the 
primary contests to date than any of his rivals 
he said his campaign lacks the financial big boulders that 
some of his opponents can claim 
i have little rocks he said but i throw them straight 
we have the most gold and silver medals in the primaries and 
caucuses so far jackson proclaimed we can win 
he said his campaign has a small budget a strong message and 
a clear vision 
jackson began his day by making it clear that he expects the 
party to nominate him if he winds up the primary season with the 
most delegates and the most votes 
becoming the nominee is logical and proper if he achieves 
those goals he said in an interview on abctvs good morning 
america 
he questioned the idea that party leaders many of whom view 
him as a sure loser in a general election campaign might turn to 
another contender 
they would not have given me the nomination i would have 
earned it from the people he said 
i dont believe in collecting a group of favorite sons and 
then selecting one the people elect whats left he added 
jackson did not address the issue of democratic party acceptance 
as he closed out his lowbudget highenergy connecticut campaign 
but in stops in middletown at a crime and drugridden area of 
waterbury and a wellattended outdoor rally in hartford he managed 
to ridicule betterfinanced opponents 
we dont have no rolls royces and no big stretch limousines on 
the road to the white house were walking but we know the road 
better he said 
in another jab he said were not getting endorsements from 
the top down were getting votes from the bottom up 
jackson stressed his message that the powerless can gain power 
if they have hope 
he said people in wheelchairs the homeless and others who come 
to hear him have the fever of hope 
theres nothing more powerful in the world than the people 
whose hope has been raised 
in his stop in the mt olive church of god and christ in 
waterbury jackson drew his loudest cheers when he condemned drug 
use we the people must say down with dope and up with hope he 
said

the nations commercial nuclear power plants 
reported 2810 accidents in 1987 about the same number as for a 
slightly smaller number of plants the previous year a group 
critical of the industry said monday 
the corresponding figure for 1986 was 2836 at the end of last 
year there were 105 nuclear plants in commercial operation against 
99 at the same point a year earlier 
the report was issued by the critical mass energy project of 
public citizen a group founded with the help of ralph nader the 
project publishes a compilation of nuclear regulatory commission 
reports annually this year on the ninth anniversary of the 
accident at the three mile island plant in pennsylvania 
the findings of this study suggest that the lesson of three 
mile island has been forgotten by the nuclear industry and its 
friendly watchdog the nrc said kenneth boley one of the 
authors of the report 
the report said 1987 figures could rise slightly as additional 
reports come in from the plants 
the commission imposed fines against utilities in 46 instances 
compared with 50 in 1986 
the report said notable events of 1987 included 
the closure of the peach bottom plant of philadelphia electric 
co for regular sleeping on duty by plant operators in a management 
culture that the institute of nuclear power operations an industry 
group called an embarrassment to the utility and the nation 
the nrcs proposal of an 80000 fine for a supervisors 
instruction to tie two valves open in violation of regulations at 
the oyster creek plant of jersey central power amp light co 
the firing of five employees by detroit edison co for their 
involvement in an incident in which a trainee operator failed to 
notify his supervisor for two hours when reactor water temperature 
reached a certain point 
scott peters of the us council for energy awareness a 
pronuclear trade group said he had not seen this years report 
but if its anything like past years it just distorts numbers to 
make the situation seem worse than it really is 
peters said industry performance improved by several measures 
he said reactors were available to generate power 618 percent 
of the time last year compared with 603 percent in 1986 
unplanned automatic shutdowns fell from 39 per reactor to 27 
unplanned activation of other safety systems fell from 12 per 
reactor to 09 and average radiation exposure per employee fell 
from 622 millirems at boiling water reactors to 521 and from 397 
millirems at pressurized water reactors to 368 
a chest xray may be as much as 25 millirems and typical 
background exposure in the united states is about 100 millrems per 
year the nrc permits civilian reactor employees to be exposed to 
5000 millirems per year 
nrc spokesman frank ingraham declined comment because he said 
the criticam mass report had not reached the commission

israel has handed over classified documents to 
independent counsel lawrence walsh for his irancontra 
investigation under a cooperation agreement reached after yearlong 
negotiations an israeli official said monday 
in return walsh apparently agreed to revoke the subpoenas he 
issued to four israelis who arranged the 1985 and 1986 shipment of 
usmade antitank and antiaircraft missiles to iran the 
official and a us lawyer indicated 
he will get what he wants without us having to give up what we 
wanted said the israeli official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
melvin rishe a lawyer representing the israeli government said 
we have reached terms of how we would proceed making litigation 
unnecessary 
israels government wanted the subpoenas dropped contending 
that all four israelis were acting under its orders and thus were 
immune from prosecution and questioning by us officials 
the agreement with walsh is on a governmenttogovernment 
basis according to israeli embassy spokesman yossi gal which 
means any questions for the four must be channeled through official 
israeli representatives 
walsh and the israeli embassy issued brief statements announcing 
the cooperation agreement but said the contents will remain 
classified 
the government of the state of israel and the office of the 
independent counsel have signed an agreement covering the 
cooperation of the government of israel in the irancontra 
investigation walsh said in a prepared statement 
independent counsel walsh expressed satisfaction with the 
agreement and said his office looks forward to continued 
cooperation with the state of israel the statement said the 
israeli statement was almost identical 
the documents handed over to walsh include detailed financial 
and historical chronologies prepared by israel for the 
congressional irancontra committees last summer said the israeli 
official 
when israel gave the chronologies to congress it stipulated 
that walsh be denied access to the documents because of his refusal 
to grant immunity to the four israelis 
along with the documents walsh has also been given written 
answers to the questions posed last year by the congressional 
investigators with regard to the chronologies the official said 
the documents are expected to help walsh answer some of his 
questions about israels swiss bank account which handled the 
funds for the shipments to iran 
walsh wanted the information to help him corroborate his case 
against former white house aides oliver north and john poindexter 
as well as businessmen richard secord and his partner albert hakim 
all four have been indicted on charges of defrauding the us 
government through the arms sales and the diversion of profits to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
last year walsh subpoenaed israeli businessmen yaakov nimrodi 
and al schwimmer as well as former foreign ministry director david 
kimche and government counterterrorism adviser amiram nir nir 
resigned from his post last week 
the agreement was finalized 10 days ago by two senior government 
representatives who held talks in washington with walsh and his 
staff the israeli government approved the accord the israeli 
official said 
the negotiations were difficult said walsh spokesman jim 
wieghart israel is a sovereign state with certain national 
security interests which they have to defend we recognized that 
but on the other hand we had our needs in this investigation he 
said

jury selection began monday in the 
political extortion trial of sam steiger an excongressman and 
former aide to gov evan mecham 
steiger 59 was charged last fall with one count of theft by 
extortion accused of trying to influence the vote of a member of 
the state board of pardons and paroles 
judge ronald s reinstein of maricopa county superior court told 
prospective jurors that the trial probably would last until 
midapril 
steiger is accused of having told parole board member ronald d 
johnson in an oct 1 telephone conversation that unless he voted 
against a motion that day seeking the resignation of parole board 
executive director patricia costello he would lose his position on 
the parole board or as a parttime justice of the peace 
johnson voted with three other board members to oust ms 
costello who had steigers and mechams backing and she stepped 
down that day 
the next day steiger allegedly sent johnson a letter saying 
johnsons permission to serve as a parttime justice of the peace 
was revoked and also that he could be fired from the parole board 
if he defied the order 
a key to the prosecutions case will be three tape recordings of 
telephone converstations with steiger reinstein ruled last week 
that prosecutor michael cudahy an assistant state attorney 
general could use the tapes 
defense attorney thomas karas had argued against their 
admissibility saying that they were secretly taped in calls to 
steiger at his home in prescott and therefore violated his privacy 
steiger who was paid more than 77000 a year as a special 
assistant to mecham until his resignation nov 9 faces two to five 
years in prison if convicted of the class four felony 
until he resigned about a month after his october indictment he 
served as one of several top aides to mecham who took office in 
january 1987

an angry and bitter william stern 
testified monday that baby m should be kept from her biological 
mother for several years to protect the child from emotional harm 
and exploitation 
stern testifying in what is expected to be the final legal 
chapter of the 2yearold dispute characterized surrogate mother 
mary beth whiteheadgould as untrustworthy and capable of 
undermining his relationship with the child legally known as 
melissa stern 
mary beth will do anything and say anything to get her way 
stern said in 2 hours of emotional testimony that ended with him 
crying 
the hearing expected to last several days was ordered by the 
new jersey supreme court in its landmark feb 3 decision that 
declared surrogacyforpay illegal and restored mrs 
whiteheadgoulds parental rights but left intact a judges order 
awarding custody of the child to the sterns 
stern and his wife elizabeth of tenafly decided to have a 
child through a surrogate mother because they feared mrs stern 
42 who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis would 
suffer complications during pregnancy 
mrs stern testified the possibility of both sides cooperating 
in the future was remote 
we dont share common values with mary beth we dont think 
about things in the same way and we dont react to situations in 
the same way mrs stern testified we are poles apart 
the sterns are seeking to cut off contact between melissa and 
mrs whiteheadgould perhaps until the childs 10th birthday mrs 
whiteheadgould now visits the child once a week for two hours 
under supervision at a childrens social services center 
mrs whiteheadgould is seeking two eighthour weekly visits at 
her home later expanded to include weekends half the summer and 
some holidays she was accompanied to court by her second husband 
wall street accountant dean gould with whom she is expecting a 
child 
the sterns agreed to pay 10000 to mrs whiteheadgould to bear 
them a child and mrs whiteheadgould was artificially inseminated 
with sterns sperm 
after the baby was born she turned 2 on sunday mrs 
whiteheadgould changed her mind and refused to surrender the child 
in testimony monday stern said melissa should be protected 
likening her to a sapling that needs to secure its roots 
if anything is done to interrupt those roots im afraid 
melissa does not have much of a future said stern a biochemist 
he said that immediate contact with mrs whiteheadgould could 
force melissa into the situation where she would have to choose 
between us 
stern said he and his wife have formed a warm loving 
relationship with melissa and his wife testified to precious 
little melissa i know im her mother 
under two hours of crossexamination by mrs whiteheadgoulds 
attorney joel siegal stern said he feared she would exploit the 
child by writing a book that could lead to a photo of melissa on 
the book jacket a film a videocassette and even a promotional 
tour for the book 
but stern acknowledged that melissa does not seem to have been 
harmed so far by her contact with mrs whiteheadgould 
his testimony ended with questions from the judge on what 
religion the child would be exposed to stern who is jewish and 
whose relatives other than his parents all died in the holocaust 
broke into tears he drank a cup of water and composed himself 
saying he expected to expose the child to a unitarian church mrs 
stern is not jewish

president reagan said monday the american 
public wont accept trade restrictions and retaliation against 
foreign manufacturers 
reagan promoting his freetrade stance even in the face of 
mounting us trade imbalances warned that a trade bill under 
consideration in congress could weaken international trading 
systems and require the president to start trade wars 
ill veto if i must reagan told reynolds metals co workers 
on the eve of a crucial housesenate conference committee meeting 
on the bill 
reagan long has advocated a policy of free trade and fair trade 
at the same time he has resisted protectionist legislation even 
as the merchandise trade deficit climbed to a record 17122 
billion in 1987 
but in his remarks monday reagan said the legislation pending 
in congress would destroy progress that us companies like 
reynolds have made 
the reality is that manufacturing exports are surging and 
manufacturing productivity is at an alltime high and rising 
rapidly reagan said 
theyve got a trade bill before congress that could squelch 
productivity destroy american competitiveness and make all their 
doomsday myths a reality he said noting that his critics have 
been predicting economic disaster although the economy is in 
the 64th month of recovery from the recession of 198182 
i think the american people have decided that one great 
depression is enough and they arent going to give the trade 
demagogues a second chance reagan said 
protectionism isnt just bad economics its bad politics 
the president said 
he pointed to the march 8 super tuesday presidential delegate 
selection contests and said those who had predicted that 
protectionism would be embraced in the south were proven wrong 
rep richard gephardt dmo who did poorly in the march 8 
delegate selection contests throughout the south had made the 
nations trade woes an important part of his campaign gephardt 
announced monday he was ending his bid for the democratic 
presidential nomination 
a halfdozen demonstrators protesting us policy in central 
america greeted reagan outside the reynolds plant when he arrived 
in the plants parking lot he was cheered by several hundred 
employees and family members many of whom waved small american 
flags 
during his tour of the facility the president walked past huge 
rolls of aluminum bound up in spools like thread at one point he 
put on safety glasses and sat down at a console that operated an 
aluminum processing machine by remote control 
reynolds is the worlds leading producer of aluminum foil and 
foil packaging the company which operates 55 plants in this 
country and has operations in 18 others also has experimented in 
new products such as a resealable can that retains carbonation 
reagan told a group of workers youre performing miracles 
you make me proud 
during a forum that reagan attended william o bourke 
reynolds president and chief executive officer told the 
president the time has come for the united states to announce to 
everyone ladies and gentlemen we are back in the export 
business 
the president also attended a 2500acouple gop fundraiser at 
a surburban hotel michael salster a party spokesman said the 
presidents appearance would add more than 50000 for the partys 
coffers 
reagans visit took place as a housesenate conference committee 
prepared to meet tuesday to work out compromises in their widely 
varying versions of a 1000page trade bill 
reagan objects to many provisions in the trade bill including 
an amendment named for gephardt that would require the president to 
reduce excess and unwarranted surpluses run up by japan and a 
few other countries in trade with the united states if 
negotiations failed the president would be required to use import 
curbs to lower the surpluses at a 10 percent annual rate 
the president could waive such action if he found it contrary to 
the national economic interest or if the offending country were 
wrestling with serious debt but critics say the plan is a long 
step toward protectionism and invites retaliation against us 
industries 
in his speech reagan said the bills mandatory retaliation 
provisions could require me and future presidents to take actions 
that would be in direct violation of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trades 
you may have been reading lately that the trade bill is making 
good progress that a lot of protectionist provisions have been 
jettisoned he said and there is some truth to that but 
theres a long way to go before the legislation does more good than 
harm to the us economy 
only wholesale elimination of the objectionable provisions 
will produce a bill i can sign the president said i wont let 
them destroy the american growth economy but id rather work with 
congress to bring about not just an acceptable bill but one that 
genuinely improves our current law 
reagan made no mention of the united states status as the 
worlds largest debtor nation it was the worlds largest creditor 
when he took office and instead pointed to figures showing last 
years gross national product growth as being 4 percent 
the us merchandise trade deficit in 1987 totaled 17122 
billion a record the trade deficit was 1244 billion in january 
the january report represented a slight setback after two 
consecutive monthly improvements and reclaimed some of the gains 
won from surging exports at the end of 1987

police and soldiers using shotguns 
rubber truncheons and tear gas broke up a march monday by thousands 
of opponents of panamas strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
meanwhile a general strike that has closed down an estimated 90 
percent of panamas industry and commerce entered its second week 
ignoring an order to disperse a crowd of more than 10000 
cheering people began walking toward the capitals central business 
district monday afternoon 
minutes later a tanker truck equipped with a turret over the 
cab sped through the line of march spraying hundreds of people 
with a choking mixture of water and chemicals that sent them 
fleeing into side streets 
behind the truck charged police and soldiers firing birdshot and 
beating people with 18inchlong rubber truncheons 
as people fled the scene in panic they left central avenue 
littered with their shoes reporters saw at least two people 
trampled in the rush including a woman who suffered a compound leg 
fracture 
before the march began lt col virgilio mirones of the panama 
defense forces urged the protesters to disperse 
we dont want to fight with the panamanian people the 
officer said through a megaphone we want to fight the united 
states 
but the swelling crowd jeered at him shouting join us join 
us and noriega must go 
the united states has called for noriegas ouster since he was 
indicted in florida in february on drugtrafficking charges the 
defense forces chief has said he is innocent 
the reagan administration has also imposed a number of economic 
sanctions on panama and supported efforts by former president eric 
arturo delvalle to freeze panamas deposits in us banks 
mondays demonstration was one of the largest in months like 
others it was smashed with drilllike precision an hour after it 
ended squads of soldiers had occupied every major intersection and 
most streets in the city 
the mayors of panama city and one of its largest poorer suburbs 
had warned protesters not to violate a ban on demonstrations that 
subvert public order 
in a communique published in staterun newspapers on monday the 
mayors said the ban imposed oct 19 1987 was still in effect 
the papers also carried a statement from the principal 
progovernment political party calling for a protest rally in front 
of the us embassy later monday 
the rule seems to apply to one protest but not the other 
said jose faundes the secretary of the panamanian human rights 
commission 
since the last major demonstration on march 16 soldiers in full 
combat gear have patrolled the streets 
the cashshort government issued checks monday to its 
lowestpaid retired public servants living in panama city and 
colon those whose semimonthly pension benefits come to 150 or 
less 
those living in other cities and retirees whose benefits total 
more than 150 every two weeks were told they would be paid later 
in the week 
many however were skeptical noting that government offices 
normally closed during the end of holy week even some who got paid 
were less than happy 
things in panama are not good said mariela sanchez a 
former government secretary who received her full 36 pension 
check we have some money today but what about next time 
an estimated 55000 people normally receive government pensions 
but there was no official estimate of how many got paid monday 
the 15000 members of panamas defense forces did not receive 
their wages last week and the government apparently doesnt have 
the cash to meet a 33 million payroll for some 130000 civilian 
workers later this week 
the government earlier had indicated it would make at least 
partial payments to all of its retirees but that plan apparently 
was put aside 
banks were closed on march 3 after a run on deposits triggered 
by the dismissal of delvalle by the national assembly dominated by 
noriega supporters 
attorneys for delvalle who still is recognized by the reagan 
administration as panamas president managed to freeze millions of 
dollars in government funds on deposit in us banks 
the civilian chief of state handpicked by noriega manuel solis 
palma told delegates at a solidarity with panama conference 
monday that washingtons actions constituted a total brutal and 
shameless aggression 
this treacherous attack is not only an attack on our country 
but on all the small and humble countries of the world solis 
palma told the representatives of populist or leftist political 
parties from about 20 nations

wyatt earp is causing a ruckus in his 
hometown six decades after his death as politicians and 
descendants of the legendary lawman quarrel over where he was born 
smalltown politics is fueling the dispute with both sides 
lining up support from elderly cousins of earp a survivor of the 
1881 gunfight at the ok corral 
this is a political vendetta against me said robert matson 
a former city council member whose successor has contested the 
pedigree of a house matson and his wife melba own and operate as 
the wyatt earp birthplace and museum in this town of 10700 
shortly after george morris 45 took over matsons council seat 
earlier this year he spearheaded a move to change the sites 
billing 
the sign that proclaimed the house earps birthplace was ordered 
changed to simply say wyatt earp museum 
i think its a super idea to promote a wyatt earp museum 
morris said but i dont want to see history passed down thats 
wrong i consider myself a historian and ive researched it along 
with some other people and we can shoot too many holes in the 
matsons theory 
matson a 61yearold school teacher contends the move to 
discredit the buildings history was prompted by lessthanpure 
motives 
george morris is a former sixthgrade student of mine hes 
got a house on the national historic register and maybe he doesnt 
want us to get ours on it why hes led such an active opposition 
to us is mysterious to me 
morris dismisses the accusation saying he has no reason to 
have any grudges against the matsons 
neither side has positive proof 
there are no county records photos or deeds to pinpoint the 
spot where virginia earp gave birth to her fourth child wyatt on 
march 19 1848 
the matsons have lined up several earp cousins to defend their 
claim that earp was born in the small twostory frame house they 
bought for 4000 in 1986 in this windblown prairie town 16 miles 
east of the mississippi river and about 190 miles north of st 
louis 
morris has countered with earps of his own as well as a 
monmouth college professor and a local newspaperman his side 
contends the matsons house didnt exist at the time of earps 
birth and that he was born either in the family homestead nearly a 
mile away or in a different house a couple blocks away 
effie earp cramer 81 one of the matsons supporters blames 
the controversy on a reporter who was preparing a story on the 
matson house as the earp birthplace in 1956 when he got scooped by 
a rival she says he wrote a story saying the birthplace was two 
blocks away 
but weldon earp 76 said hes seen research that shows the 
house where wyatt was born was moved from its original location two 
or three times 
earp was a peace officer in the wild west in 1879 he went to

thousands of meter readers cashiers 
and other utility employees are looking out for the welfare of many 
of illinois 18 million senior citizens by volunteering in a 
program called gatekeeper 
many are isolated and theres no support system around to 
notice if they are having problems gatekeepers can link them into 
the aging network said jeanne blackman consumer advocate at the 
department of aging which runs the communityservice program 
the backbone of the system is utilitycompany workers 
cashiers customer service representatives maintenance crews and 
meter readers 
we teach them how to recognize signs that an older person 
needs help and give them the telephone numbers to make anonymous 
calls to local agencies or the state department of aging said 
department spokeswoman jan costello 
the result 
when an illinois power co worker noticed rags were being used 
to plug holes in the windows of a madison county home he alerted 
social workers 
the residents were provided with a heater and blankets with 
followup under a weatherization program 
bill mcpherrin of galesburg a 22year ip veteran became an 
active gatekeeper the first day he learned of the program 
i thought there was a terrific need for it were in peoples 
homes and we see all types of living conditions mcpherrin said 
illinois power northern illlinois gas co central illinois 
public service co and several rural electric cooperatives 
participate in the program and more than 6000 utility workers 
have been trained to notice signs of trouble 
we feel it has worked exceptionally well ms costello said 
its an easy program to operate and very costeffective 
state officials have asked illinois bell and springfields 
municipally owned utility to participate and are awaiting responses 
officials want to work any kinks out of the program before 
extending it to commonwealth edison co the states largest 
electrical utility which serves 3 million northern illinois 
customers ms blackman said 
all 2600 cips employees are being trained as gatekeepers said 
spokesman ed mcdowell adding the utility views the program as a 
way to promote good will 
its a winwin situation from our companys perspective he 
said we see it as an opportunity to help cips customers and get 
information about government sevices that is useful in our own 
lives 
we are the eyes and ears for government agencies 
gatekeepers have been operating since last fall in some areas of 
illinois similar programs are in place in more than half of the 
other states said don kent a washington spokesman for the us 
administration on aging

the first female member of the 
friars club of beverly hills filed a sex discrimination complaint 
monday because she is being denied use of its health club 
obviously such secondclass citizenship within the club could 
deter many women from joining said attorney gloria allred 
noting she pays the same dues as male club members 
the fight for womens equality will not end until women are 
permitted both in the board rooms and the steam rooms she said 
the state board of equalization can disallow business tax 
expenses at private clubs that discriminate under a rule that took 
effect jan 1 equalization board member conway collis said he 
wanted to inspect the friars club facilities this week 
when allred became the friars first female duespaying member 
in its 32year history in may she was greeted warmly by comedian 
and friars president milton berle frank sinatra and dean martin 
are also members and president reagan is a past president 
the friars club is primarily a theatrical social club 
in january allred asked friars officials about arrangements for 
women wishing to use the sauna steam room and whirlpool there are 
four women in the club but allred is the only one who wants to use 
the health club 
there is no legal requirement on the part of the club to 
afford you the use of the health club facilities friars club 
legal chairman william sarnoff said in a letter of reply 
there was no immediate comment from the friars club on monday 
and a message was left for sarnoff at club

of a prominent leftist politician the leader said he may have been 
the intended target

the killings occurred as military units around the country were 
on full alert in anticipation of steppedup rebel attacks marking 
tuesdays 19th anniversary of the 24000member new peoples army 
the group is the military wing of the communist party of the 
philippines 
communist rebels have been blamed for killing more than 150

established the calls authenticity 
florendo said the military was investigating whether the ambush 
on oreta was in retaliation for the slaying of leftist youth leader

contested congressional race last year and leftist groups had 
linked the oreta family to his murder the oretas had denied any 
connection

for the first time 
theyre wonderful really wonderful just marvelous he 
said when the streets end in the heavens then comes another 
view 
mayor art agnos proclaimed the day freidel klussmann day in 
honor of the late neighborhood activist who helped save the cable 
cars from bus advocates in the 1940s 
theyre out of doors and theyre openair seating and i love 
the history behind them said san franciscan gail hansell 26

tradition they are a beautiful way to see the city said hansell 
police chief frank jordan estimated the crowd at the parade at 
nearly 3000 
the powell street line which began service in 1888 carries 
about 41000 passengers a day on 3mile panoramic rides over hills 
with views of alcatraz fishermans wharf chinatown union square

california street line whose 100th anniversary 15 years ago set 
off a twoweek party 
the rattletrap cars propelled by a cable under the street 
rumble along at 9 mph and lack the comfortable seats and space of 
modern buses but they were saved in the 1940s after a campaign by 
klussmann and a court once declared illegal a 1956 attempt to 
radically modernize the cars in 1964 they were named the united 
states first moving national historical landmark

house speaker jim wright said monday he was 
unaware that his friend and adviser richard pena had tried to 
sell weapons to the contras through former white house aide lt 
col oliver l norths secret contra aid operation 
i dont know a thing in the world about that wright 
dtexas said when asked by reporters about an armssale offer made 
by pena in august 1986 three months before disclosure of the 
irancontra weapons and money affair shut down the north network 
wright said if pena was involved in such activity it was at a 
time when he wasnt directly working with me 
the speaker has a record of opposition to us military aid to 
the contra rebels tyring to overthrow the nicaraguan government he 
also has been active in working toward a negotiated peace in 
nicaragua 
in an aug 15 1986 letter pena wrote to a front company set 
up by norths associate richard miller offering to procure 
grenades bombs mines and boots from two south american companies 
the letter went to world affairs counselors a cayman islands 
front company formed by miller and his partner frank gomez to 
handle their contra transactions for north 
wright said he first learned of the matter when contacted last 
week by the associated press which obtained a copy of penas 
letter 
he said he knew of no activity by pena that was unethical or 
illegal or at all dishonest 
he said pena was a friend and very knowledgeable person 
whose spanish speaking ability has helped wright pick up 
conversational details the speaker sometimes misses regarding 
central american issues 
pena has been one of wrights advisers on central america over 
the past several years and as recently as january was the texas 
democrats paid emissary to the region as the warring factions 
wrangled over starting ceasefire talks wright aide marshall lynam 
said he said pena was on the speakers payroll for a few days on 
each of three occasions 
pena now works for a lobbying firm cassidy and associates his 
office said he was on vacation and had not checked in for messages 
as of monday 
pena was deposed by the congressional committees investigating 
the secret sale of us weapons to iran and the diversion of funds 
to the contras pena told investigators he contacted miller in 
hopes of making a deal for part of the 70 million in renewed 
contra military aid that congress approved in the fall of 1986 
according to a capitol hill source who read penas deposition 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
deposition contained no mention of wright or north pena said he 
knew miller was involved with the contras 
pena indicated to investigators that he thought he could offer 
the contras a better deal than they would get through other us 
purchasing routes the source said 
it was unclear why pena would have gone to miller a 
nongovernment businessman and the cayman company to arrange the 
deal rather than through us government channels 
pena worked as a house foreign affairs committee staff 
consultant from august 1982 to november 1985 a job for which 
wright recommended him 
one former staff member for the congressional irancontra 
investigating committees said the committee staff decided not to 
pursue the pena matter because it appeared to be an isolated 
incident rather than an integral part of the north network 
miller pleaded guilty in the irancontra case along with 
conservative fundraiser carl spitz channell to conspiring 
with north to defraud the government by raising money through a 
taxexempt foundation to purchase weapons for the contras 
miller worked with north then a national security council aide 
raising private money to help the contras during the congressional 
ban on us aid 
millers company international business communications routed 
nearly 3 million through the caymans which was disbursed at 
norths direction to the rebel effort the irancontra committees 
report said 
north has been charged along with president reagans former 
national security adviser rear adm john m poindexter and two 
other men with conspiring to defraud the united states of 17 
million in iran arms sale proceeds and for operating a secret 
contra assistance program during the aid ban

the chairman of the alabama democratic 
party said monday he is exploring the possibility of forming a 
southern group of uncommitted delegates to endorse an electable 
presidential candidate 
weve got to keep one eye if not two eyes on the november 
general election said john baker of montgomery im tired of 
the democratic party having a ticket that cant carry but one or 
two states im embarrassed by losing four out of the last five 
elections 
the party chairman hopes to find 50 to 100 southern super 
delegates who are interested in making a joint endorsement 
unlike delegates elected in the super tuesday primary the party 
officials and others dubbed super delegates are not committed to a 
particular candidate 
baker sent letters to alabamas 12 super delegates and to 13 
southern party chairman to see if they were interested in trying to 
make a joint endorsement 
its possible this group could make a commitment at the same 
time that would be a tremendous boost to someone baker said 
but its too early at this point to say which of the democratic 
candidates might be electable in november he added

the leadoff presidential caucuses received 
twice as much television coverage as all 20 super tuesday contests 
this year on network evening newscasts a media analyst says 
robert lichter codirector of the center for media and public 
affairs said the super tuesday primaries and caucuses also got 
short shrift compared to the new hampshire primary on feb 16 
iowans chose 89 gop and democratic delegates in their feb 8 
caucuses which were the subject of 105 stories lichter said in 
new hampshire only 40 delegates were chosen and more than 80 
stories were aired 
super tuesday by contrast had 2056 delegates at stake but the 
three major networks ran only 53 stories lichter said 
lichter labeled super tuesday a failure because it failed to 
shift the focus of attention to the south the media shined a 
1000watt spotlight on the early primaries and a onewatt 
flashlight on super tuesday he said

one of the costliest crop pests of farmers and 
home gardeners may one day be curbed by a natural enemy a 
microscopic killer worm that searches the soil for the corn 
rootworm the agriculture department said monday 
the tiny worm or nematode is called steinernema feltiae after 
infecting the rootworm the nematode releases a bacterium that 
kills the pest then said usda entomologist jan j jackson the 
nematode uses the larvas body as a place to reproduce while it 
feasts on bacteria and larva tissue 
about 10 days later hundreds of new nematodes emerge and start 
searching for more rootworms 
that gives you an advantage over chemical controls he said 
in a report by the departments agricultural research service a 
chemical just sits there and waits for the rootworm to come to it 
the nematode doesnt wait 
but jackson found that the nematodes dont persist in the ground 
long enough to eliminate a rootworm infestation in one field trial 
where he works at the departments northern grain insects research 
laboratory in brookings sd jackson applied 100000 nematodes to 
the base of each of several corn plants reducing rootworm damage 
by 11 percent 
jackson said that is not an acceptable level of control but he 
expects further research could lead to protection as good as from 
chemical insecticides a separate test with a chemical reduced root 
damage by 44 percent 
rootworm larvae destroy corn roots and adults feed on the 
leaves tassels and ears jackson said us corn producers spend 
nearly 350 million a year to fight the rootworms nematodes 
probably could be produced at about the same cost without the risk 
of chemical injury to farmers and the environment

the israeli army on monday imposed its broadest 
restrictions yet on the 15 million palestinians in the occupied 
territories sealing the regions for three days to combat a plo day 
of protest 
army spokesmen said journalists were being barred from the 
territories where 119 palestinians and an israeli soldier have 
been killed in nearly four months of violence 
it is the first such ban since israel captured the west bank and 
gaza strip from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
under the orders the 650000 palestinians in gaza cannot leave 
their homes and the 850000 in the west bank will be confined to 
their villages and towns the army said 
the 65000 jewish settlers who in the occupied lands will be 
permitted to move freely 
an army statement said the threeday shutdown began at 10 pm 
monday in the gaza strip and 1 am tuesday in the west bank 
a military source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
telephone links to the gaza strip also were cut for the three days 
another rule bars palestinians from crossing the two bridges 
over the jordan river the army said but incoming traffic from 
jordan will be permitted about 110000 arabs who work in israel 
will not be able to leave the territories 
in washington the state department criticized israel for 
sealing off the territories 
we regret the decision because of the impact it wll have on 
commerce on visits with family members and the press spokesman 
charles e redman said 
on friday the department advised us citizens to avoid travel 
to the areas because of continuing disturbances 
the closure followed a mass arrest campaign aimed at preventing 
violence wednesday when palestinians mark land day the 12th 
anniversary of a 1976 clash between soldiers and arabs over the 
confiscation of arab land six palestinians were killed 
the palestine liberation organization has ordered widespread 
protests against israeli troops and jewish settlers 
israels ability to deal with expected unrest on land day is 
viewed as a major test of the militarys muscle to quell the 
uprising that began dec 8 
the closure stems first from our desire to tell the arabs you 
decided on land day so lets have a confrontation well see who 
wins defense minister yitzhak rabin said on israel radio 
remember we have not exhausted every means of control at our 
disposal 
rabin said the measures also were taken to prevent arabs from 
the occupied territories from inciting violence among arabs who 
live in israel 
robert slater president of the foreign press association 
condemned the restrictions and said the group was considering legal 
action he said the association had rejected an army offer to allow 
a media pool into the territories accompanied by a military 
spokesman 
pools are meant for when there is no room for huge numbers of 
people and there is obviously plenty of room for everybody in the 
territories said slater of time magazine 
israels 24member cabinet authorized the measures during its 
weekly session sunday israeli officials said 
the purpose is to keep the territories quiet it is not 
directed specifically against the press but we dont want to give 
the people of the areas any reason for causing disturbances said 
a senior defense ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in addition to the new measures troops have arrested about 550 
arabs since saturday including at least 75 overnight monday in the 
dheishe refugee camp near bethlehem and the jabaliya camp in gaza 
the arabowned palestine press service said 
police spokeswoman ruth lessinger said security was also 
increased in arab areas of israel with traffic police summoned for 
riot duty all police vacations canceled and 12hour work days 
ordered for officers 
she said 4000 extra police would be ready for mobilization 
wednesday and could be taken by helicopter to trouble spots 
leftwing legislator gadi yatziv of mapam said the restrictions 
were the first significant victory of the uprising 
the arabs have managed to force us to take undemocratic 
measures and the message we will convey on land day will be more 
negative than anything else yatziv said on the radio 
on the political front prime minister yitzhak shamir sharply 
protested a meeting between secretary of state george p shultz and 
two arabamericans linked to the plo 
we see as very grave the attempts of the americans to initiate 
contacts with plo members shamir said in an address to israels 
120member parliament

the senate on monday approved a resolution 
authorizing the reagan administration to implement the proposed 
compact of free association between the united states and the 
pacific trust territory of palau 
the voicevote action sent the measure to the house where 
similar legislation has been stalled by an investigation by the 
interior committee into allegations of governmental corruption in 
palau 
the senate resolution would permit the compact which would end 
40 years of us trusteeship over palau to be implemented so long 
as there is no pending legal challenge to a plebescite last summer 
in the islands 
palauan dissidents have talked of filing a court suit 
challenging the legality of the plebescite in which a majority of 
voters approved amending their constitution to drop its prohibition 
against nuclear weapons in palau 
leaders of the interior committee have sent congressional 
investigators to palau to probe allegations that senior palau 
officials may be involved with the smuggling of southeast asia 
heroin into the united states 
the investigators also are looking into reports that palau 
officials have have received unjustified payments from a british 
company that built a power plant for the palau government 
the administration which sees palau as a militarily strategic 
area has been pressing congress to allow it to implement the 
compact so it can get the united nations to cancel the trusteeship 
imposed after world war ii 
under the proposed compact the united states would handle 
military and diplomatic affairs for palau whose ailing economy 
would get some 428 million in us aid in the first 15 years of 
the 50year pact

a federal judge refused monday to stop next 
sundays hike in postal rates ruling he lacked jurisdiction to 
order the postal service to delay the increase for two months 
us district judge charles r richey ruled that he did not have 
jurisdiction to rule on a request by trade groups representing 
mailorder and directmail firms for an injunction delaying the 
imposition of the new postal rates until june 4 
but richey said the trade groups could take their complaint to 
the us circuit court of appeals here 
the plaintiffs including the mail order association of america 
the third class mail association and the magazine publishers 
association contended that any increase before june 4 was illegal 
the suit charged that the postal rate commission calculated the 
rate hike to take effect on that date and that the postal service 
lacked authority to charge higher rates before then 
the postal service will raise an extra 700 million by raising 
rates in april instead of june the lawsuit said 
on sunday the cost of firstclass stamps will increase from 22 
cents to 25 cents with corresponding hikes for second third and 
fourthclass mail

the us navy confiscated film from a 
member of a pentagon news pool in the persian gulf for security 
reasons but the pentagon said monday afternoon it was being 
returned 
thomas salyer a photographer for united press international 
said intelligence officers refused to return 36 of 61 negatives he 
took of an abandoned iranian gunboat seized thursday by the guided 
missile frigate reuben james in the strait of hormuz 
it was the first known confiscation of material from a pool 
member 
us officials had directed earlier that some portions of tape 
taken by an nbc cameraman in the pool be blocked out the team 
later was allowed to dub a version of its own tape with those 
portions excluded 
in washington the pentagon released a statement monday from the 
us central command saying salyers film was being returned 
three rolls of film were developed and half of the exposures 
were withheld from the upi photographer by navy officials after a 
determination was made at the scene that the information revealed 
in the film was classified it said 
in retrospect the decision to classify the film was overly 
cautious officers at the us central command reviewed the list of 
materials found on the boat and have have found no sensitive 
materials to warrant continued withholding of the film 
the official concern in both cases was over showing certain 
artillery shells found in the boat the serial numbers on its gun 
a 25mm antiaircraft weapon and a large box that was sealed but 
believed to contain ammunition 
the wooden box was not opened aboard the reuben james and us 
officers refused to speculate on what it contained 
standing rules governing the pentagon news pools provide that 
all written audio and pictorial material must be cleared for 
security by us officials at the department of defense before it 
can be released and distributed generally to media being served by 
the pool 
this material is scrutinized at the operational level such as 
aboard ships but is not censored if there is a question 
concerning security it is referred to the department of defense 
although the system has been in effect for several years the 
persian gulf is the first place it has been used for coverage of 
real military operations rather than maneuvers and exercises 
since the news pools were instituted for the gulf in july there 
have been several cases in which pool escort officers alerted 
defense department officials to a potental security problem in 
written news copy but in all cases it was cleared by the pentagon 
as written 
the pentagon also has not objected to any audio video or photo 
reports obtained by the pool journalists 
salyer said he was asked to submit his film for examination by 
intelligence experts aboard the uss coronado command ship of the 
joint task force middle east and its gulfbased component the 
middle east force 
he said that after three officers had spent several hours 
examining it he was told some of the film would be kept because 
when blown up to larger size it revealed the serial numbers of the 
gun or disclosed other valuable intelligence data 
salyer noting that he had earlier been allowed to ship some 
other film of the boat and the nighttime operation to recover it 
said he thought the officers overreacted in confiscating the 
second batch of pictures 
he said the navy also seemed to be imposing a double 
standard on him that didnt apply to others 
we were all told in advance that the boat material would be 
subjected to security review salyer said after looking at the 
film they said i could have only a part of it back and i could 
appeal through the freedom of information act for the rest of it 
experienced pool participants could recall no previous occasion 
when any news material was confiscated 
maj barry willey a public affairs officer assigned to the pool 
from the us central command headquarters in tampa fla said he 
also did not recall a precedent 
willey said the decision to withhold the film was made here 
because there was no way to get it to the pentagon for review in 
a timely manner

ten american and european academics on monday 
disputed the army account of an incident involving the visitors 
tour bus that led to a clash in which israeli soldiers fatally shot 
two palestinians 
the version released by the army spokesman is to put it 
mildly a gross distortion said zachary lockman who teaches 
middle east history at harvard university 
were quite concerned about our trip being used as a pretext 
for what followed he told a news conference about the incident 
sunday 
an army spokesman said sunday that soldiers went to the rescue 
of an israeli tour bus under attack in the arab town of salfit 20 
miles north of jerusalem 
he said the bus driver mistakenly entered salfit and 
palestinans stoned the vehicle and then attacked soldiers sent to 
the scene the soldiers responded with gunfire that killed two 
palestinians he said 
on monday an army spokeswoman said soldiers entered the town 
becaue of reports of a hijacked bus 
they quickly discovered there was nothing wrong and began to 
withdraw when the soldiers were attacked by a large group of 
hundreds of arabs throwing bottles pieces of metal and concrete 
blocks said the spokeswoman who was not identified in line with 
military regulations 
lockman joined by other other professors at the news 
conference said the vehicle was clearly marked as a bus from bir 
zeit university an arab institution he said their group had gone 
to salfit to talk with palestinians 
he said villagers greeted them warmly and the town was peaceful 
throughout the 30 to 45minute stay 
lockman who speaks hebrew said he overheard an army officer at 
a checkpoint tell his commanding officer by radio that we the 
tour group had not been under any threat whatsoever he said an 
army helicopter flew over salfit during the groups visit 
he added that as the bus left the area it went by a force of 
soldiers heading toward the town 
jack taft a lecturer in peace and conflict studies at the 
university of california at berkeley noted that the army 
frequently bars reporters from scenes of conflict 
i think thats the central point he said the army as the 
sole source of information can fabricate any story it likes

unsponsored afghanistan talks resumed monday 
after a weekend recess and word that moscow remains unyielding in 
the dispute over foreign arms supplies to parties in the conflict 
pakistans chief negotiator said the question of symmetry 
simultaneous cessation of soviet military aid to the kabul 
government and us aid to the moslem guerrillas fighting it was 
the final unresolved issue 
acting foreign minister zain noorani said that for the united 
states and pakistan it is of major concern 
it is outside the formal scope of the indirect geneva talks 
between islamabad and kabul but the superpowers are the designated 
guarantors of any peace settlement the united states has said it 
will accept that role only if there is a balance of obligations 
speaking to reporters before a formal session with un mediator 
diego cordovez noorani said the moment moscow agrees on a 
symmetrical cutoff of arms aid my pen is with me and i will 
sign 
over the weekend noorani met with special soviet envoy nikolay 
kozyrev who has been following the talks from the wings since the 
latest round began march 2 
sources close to the pakistani delegation said kozyrev made 
clear that moscow remains firm on the arms cutoff secretary of 
state george p shultz meeting last week with soviet foreign 
minister a eduard shevardnadze in washington indicated 
flexibility in the us stand 
shultz suggested the superpowers agree at least on a temporary 
freeze or something close to it but shevardnadze ruled out 
symmetry the soviets reject the us symmetry demand as amounting 
to interference with relations between two states noting that 
moscow and kabul are bound by international treaties 
kozyrev reportedly suggested pakistan go ahead and sign the 
three main accords without waiting for us and soviet agreement on 
the fourth spelling out the superpower guarantees 
shevardnadze struck that note last week at a washington news 
conference when he said the afghan question can be resolved 
without us guarantees 
the text of the peace package said to comprise about 25 
typewritten pages has been translated and scrutinized by legal 
experts noorani says he considers the documents complete 
afghanistan was reported still opposed to having the text refer to 
international boundaries because of what it considers a border 
dispute dating to pakistans independence 
sources close to the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said they were confident that question could be settled

repulsed an iraqi counterattack in their drive into kurdistan and 
now hold more than 540 square miles of the strategic region in 
northeast iraq 
iranian gunboats attacked two supertankers in the persian gulf 
setting them ablaze and iraqibacked opponents of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini claimed several thousand of their fighters 
overran iranian positions in southwest iran

northeast vowed to destroy the iranian aggressors with all 
available means 
baghdads official news agency said the iraqis fired three 
longrange missiles into the holy city of qom 100 miles south of

attacks and the air raids on dezful ilam borujerd and kuhdasht 
iran said its artillery hammered military and industrial 
targets in the southern city of basra shelled daily for more 
than a month and five other border towns 
if the iranian claim of a major advance into kurdistan is true 
it would mark iraqs worst military setback since the iranians 
fought to within six miles of basra a year ago iran still occupies 
land east of the battered city 
the iraqi armys alqadessiyah daily heightening the belief 
that the iranians have made gains exhorted soldiers to pour your

richard gephardt quit the democratic 
presidential race monday saying we lost no question about 
that but declaring his party can win the white house in the fall 
only by picking up his populist economic themes 
gephardt whose campaign faltered after his initial win in 
iowas caucuses on feb 8 said he would file for reelection to 
his house seat from missouri 
i believe that our effort was not in vain that we challenged 
the democratic party and called it back to its central role as an 
agent of fundamental change gephardt said at an emotional 
capitol hill news conference packed with journalists and 
supporters including many of his house colleagues 
gephardt had appealed to workers farmers and the downtrodden 
with his theme of its your fight too he said his drive had 
brought other candidates closer to his positions on trade and farm 
policy and would result in a nominee committed to fight for 
economic justice 
that was our message and that is our victory now that message 
belongs to all the democratic party i am convinced that it is 
the only way for us to win in 1988 and beyond gephardt said as 
his wife clasped her hands and fought back tears 
the missouri congressman also accompanied by his three 
children quipped i havent seen a crowd this large in a long 
long time after entering the ornate caucus room and giving a 
thumbsup sign to his supporters 
gephardt predicted a democratic nominee would be chosen from 
among those now running but refused to throw his support to anyone 
he said he might make an endorsement at a later time 
gephardts withdrawal left jesse jackson just ahead of dukakis 
in the ap delegate count 
most of gephardts delegates were shifted into the uncommitted 
category with his withdrawal but missouri party rules mandate that 
the atlarge and public official delegates are redivided among the 
active candidates when a contender drops out that gave jackson at 
least six more delegates 
jackson now has 60655 massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
60555 tennessee sen albert gore jr 3628 sen paul simon 1685 
and uncommitted 5156 according to the ap count 
asked to comment on jacksons candidacy gephardt replied i 
believe jesse jackson can be nominated and i think he can be 
elected he turned down a chance to give advice to the partys 
other frontrunner dukakis with whom he had engaged in sharp 
exchanges of negative tv ads 
michael dukakis has sure done a lot better than i did 
gephardt said i dont think its my place to tell him what to 
do 
gephardt attributed his failed candidacy to a lack of money and 
said that when he was able to get his ideas across we did 
connect but he added i have no alibis we lost no question 
about that 
gephardts wins in iowa south dakota and his home state were 
buried by disappointing showings in more than two dozen other 
states including michigan where he had said he needed a 
michigan miracle last saturday to revive his campaign 
with his tough trade stance the sixterm congressman might have 
been expected to do well in a state heavy with unions and 
automakers but he failed to win labor backing and finished a 
distant third in the michigan caucuses behind jackson and dukakis 
gephardt a consensus builder in the house found a niche in the 
presidential race as an antiestablishment populist he had a 
wellhoned message and an aggressive television campaign 
but gephardt 47 was hampered by a chronic shortage of cash and 
by continuing skepticism about his populist challenge to the 
apostles of the status quo 
as chairman of the house democratic caucus gephardt was hardly 
a stranger to the establishment he so bitterly attacked during his 
campaign he was also vulnerable because of switches over the years 
on issues ranging from abortion to reaganomics 
the wellheeled dukakis ran pointed television ads one showing 
a man flipflopping through the air and the other a list of 
gephardts corporate contributors sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee not only attacked gephardt on his changes of heart but 
adopted his same populist theme 
after michigan gephardt had only 167 delegates less than 
onethird the totals amassed by dukakis and jackson and fewer than 
even sen paul simon of illinois who didnt compete on super 
tuesday 
last year gephardts poll showings in iowa had been in the 
single digits until after christmas when he began running tv ads 
among them was his famous hyundai spot alleging that a 10000 
chrysler kcar would cost 48000 in korea because of trade tariffs 
trade experts challenged the accuracy of the ad but that didnt 
dilute its impact in iowa the tv drive combined with the 
grassroots network gephardt had doggedly built over two years 
propelled him to victory in the feb 8 caucuses 
later that month gephardt won the south dakota primary largely 
on the strength of an ad charging that dukakis was one of the 
biggest taxraisers in massachusetts history and saying dukakis 
idea of helping farmers was telling them to grow belgian endive 
gephardt formally declared his candidacy on feb 23 1987 but 
he had begun campaigning more than a year earlier his last 
campaign speech was in milwaukee before wisconsin democrats whose 
primary is tuesday all things considered he told them id 
rather be back in des moines

gov buddy roemer on monday signed 
legislation giving him unprecedented authority to cut spending and 
raise fees to lift louisiana out of a fiscal crisis blamed on the 
sagging oil and gas industry 
roemer who took office march 15 said his first round of 
spending reductions would include layoffs administration 
spokeswoman sidney coffee said the cuts would not be announced 
before tuesday 
the legislation was adopted in a special fiveday session 
completed saturday 
after lawmakers finished their work roemer said the temporary 
authority will be tempered by my compassion and good sense that 
they legislators will be coming back in three and a half weeks to 
look over my shoulder 
in addition to power to cut entire programs and close 
institutions through june 30 the administration also won the right 
to raise fees without public hearings or legislative oversight 
the governor said he was aiming for 50 million in spending cuts 
for the remaining quarter of the fiscal year and 22 million in fee 
increases 
commissioner of administration brian kendrick said budget 
officials worked through the weekend to come up with a list of 
proposed cuts to present to roemer late monday were moving as 
fast as we can he said 
kendrick also said work would begin on the new louisiana 
recovery district a commission created by the legislature to 
impose up to a 1 percent sales tax to finance bonds that would pay 
off the states 13 billion longterm debt 
the commission cannot issue bonds or impose the 1 percent levy 
until the legislature drops the same amount from the current 
fourcent state sales tax 
the commission was set up to get around a provision in the 
louisiana constitution barring use of an existing source of revenue 
to pay off a deficit it also enables the governor to get around a 
requirement that tax increases receive the twothirds approval of 
the legislature 
the administration will ask the louisiana supreme court to rule 
on the constitutionality of the plan if it does not pass legal 
muster the state will use shortterm bonds to finance the debt 
kendrick said 
kendrick also said the shortterm notes would be used to help 
overcome the 200 million cash shortfall remaining for the rest of 
the fiscal year ending june 30

col moammar gadhafi said monday he is 
withdrawing libyan forces from the border with egypt but he did not 
specify a time frame for the pullback 
such a move would represent a conciliatory gesture unprecedented 
since gadhafis feud with egypt began 16 years ago 
the libyan leaders announcement in this mediterranean city 75 
miles west of the egyptian border followed a series of goodwill 
gestures made by both countries in recent weeks 
gadhafi did not say how many troops libya has along the border 
i want to emphasize to the egyptian people and army that the 
libyan eastern military zone beside the border will finally be 
abolished gadhafi told a crowd of 2500 gathered in tobruk once 
a key british base 
the ceremony marked the 18th anniversary of britains evacuation 
of its military bases in libya 
gadhafi said the border forces would be withdrawn without us 
asking for anything in return from the egyptian side and he 
offered to let egypt verify the withdrawal 
gadhafi who wore a bright red jumpsuit paused repeatedly 
during his 1hour speech as the crowd chanted long live the 
revolution and antiamerican slogans 
gadhafi also said libya would not use force to undermine 
egyptian president hosni mubaraks government or to pressure it to 
renounce the 1979 peace treaty with israel egypt is the only arab

george bush on monday picked up the endorsement 
of rep jack kemp who said of the vice president hes earned 
it 
the new york congressman who withdrew from the race earlier 
this month after disappointing showings in gop contests said his 
endorsement of bush was unequivocal and that he would 
vigorously campaign for him 
bush said the endorsement means a lot to me and called his 
former rival a rising star in the republican party nationally 
kemp appearing with bush at a news conference as the vice 
president began a threeday campaign sweep through wisconsin told 
reporters that the subject of a possible vice presidential bid did 
not come up in his talks with bush 
bush asked whether he had considered extending an invitation to 
kemp to join him on a national ticket said such speculation was 
premature 
its too early to get into the vice presidency question 
bush said commenting on his recent wins in republican primary 
races bush said the numbers are strong 
however turning to the subject of sen bob doles campaign the 
vice president said he did not want to say anything that might be 
construed as an effort to pressure dole to formally withdraw 
im just going to keep on campaigning each person has to make 
that decision on his own bush said 
however kemp said that recent remarks by dole including a 
speech earlier monday in washington during which he thanked his 
supporters appeared tantamount to a withdrawal from the race 
he talked in such a way to acknowledge his campaign has come 
to a close kemp said dole had said last friday that bushs 
nomination now seemed a foregone conclusion 
later bush told an invitationonly rally in a high school in 
cedarburg wis that i dont put too much stock in the polls 
but they do look good 
still he told his audience i will not project an arrogance 
i will not project overconfidence 
he said kemps endorsement was good because what we want to 
do is to have this party unified together so we can whip the 
democrats 
one of the best things that happened to me was getting my 
brains kicked out in iowa bush added everybody had me dead 
and buried we were resurrected right there in new hampshire so 
people say now things are going pretty well for you and they are 
kemp said that at the time he entered the gop race i believed 
i was the best candidate for republican conservatives the voters 
believed otherwise 
turning to the democratic race bush expressed admiration for 
the growing strength of jesse jackson 
the mans racking up delegates and thats how you get 
elected bush said what he has done is very admirable he hung 
in there hes doing very well by taking his case out to the 
people 
bush said that despite the numbers on the republican side he 
wasnt taking anything for granted 
i dont want to project that its all over he said 
kemp told the news conference the time has come for all 
republicans to unite behind this man who has been a fine and loyal 
vice president 
as one involved in the friendly competition hes earned it 
kemp said then turning to bush kemp said you can count on 
jack kemp in 88

an angry gov evan mecham took offense 
during his impeachment trial monday at a prosecutors comparing his 
actions to embezzlement 
i resent so highly the word embezzlement in my presence im 
insulted by it mecham declared ignoring orders by arizona chief 
justice frank gordon to refrain from commenting beyond answering 
questions 
gordon who already had ruled the question irrelevant 
admonished mecham again telling him i hope you believe the 
rules are for you sir as well as everybody else 
mecham responded hotly i have seen no witness who has been 
insulted as i have been 
the outburst came after house prosecutor william french tried to 
compare mechams loan of 80000 to mechams auto dealership from a 
protocol fund to a bank officer borrowing money from a bank 
vault and later replacing it 
that doesnt make the bank official any less guilty of 
embezzlement does it said french citing mechams repeated 
references to the fact that his dealership paid back the loan with 
interest 
defense attorney jerris leonard objected and gordon sustained 
the objection 
mecham who began his second round of testimony friday and 
completed it monday is charged with misusing state funds by 
loaning the 80000 to mecham pontiac the charge is the second of 
three against him 
as he left the stand he suggested the senate drop the third 
count that he concealed a 350000 campaign loan and judge him 
right away on the first two 
in response to a question from a senator on how he thought they 
should proceed mecham said he wouldnt mind if they decided to 
call this game at the end of six innings and forget the last 
charge 
he cited the effect of the hearing on his april 21 criminal 
trial on charges of concealing the campaign loan 
outside the senate chamber majority leader robert usdane who 
like mecham is a republican said the chances of dropping the third 
count were about as good as me going out and jumping off the 
highest building i can find 
he called the loan concealment charge one of the most serious 
allegations that was made by the house 
mecham also asked that the senate at least postpone hearing the 
third count until after his trial but minority leader alan 
stephens said thats as likely as as jimmy carter being elected 
president of the united states again 
in his testimony monday mecham maintained the loan was secure 
with his company and a good investment for the money which 
originally raised by his inaugural committee 
french in a series of hypothetical questions suggested mecham 
felt the money belonged to him not the state 
could you have used the 80000 to put a swimming pool and 
tennis court in the back yard of your house he asked mecham 
i probably could have done it if id invited all of the 
legislators and cabinet officers to swim once a month mecham 
said with a smile he then added i shouldnt jest with you on 
these ridiculous questions 
however he conceded that under his theory he could have loaned 
the money to his wife for whatever she wanted to spend it on as 
long as it was paid back with interest 
mecham also testified he could not recall whether his thenchief 
of staff jim colter or anyone else advised that the loan was 
politically unwise 
were all good monday morning quarterbacks said mecham 
and everybody decided it was a stupid thing to do after the 
fact 
the protocol fund was set up after a state law barred use of the 
funds to pay off mechams campaign debts the prosecution claims 
the money became a public fund for state promotion mecham claims 
it remained private for use at his discretion 
the 63yearold mecham the first us governor to face an 
impeachment trial in six decades in previous testimony denied a 
charge that he tried to thwart investigation of an alleged death 
threat on a grand jury witness 
besides the impeachment and criminal trials mecham also faces a 
recall election may 17 
in other developments monday jury selection began in the 
political extortion trial of sam steiger an excongressman and 
former mecham aide he resigned after being charged with trying to 
influence the vote of a member of the state board of pardons and 
paroles

progress toward solving the dispute over 
participation of us contractors in japanese construction projects 
was reported monday night as the two governments scheduled a third 
day of negotiations 
us deputy trade representative michael b smith and ichiro 
ozawa deputy chief secretary of prime minister noboru takeshitas 
cabinet agreed to meet again tuesday after sessions last friday 
night and most of monday 
there has been significant progress but we do not yet have an 
agreement said smiths spokeswoman kelly winkler both smith 
and ozawa planned to consult their governments before tuesdays 
talk she said the japanese embassy said the talks were marked by 
both progress and continung problems 
ozawa arrived last week and started formal negotiations friday 
in hope of averting further us reprisals for exclusion of 
american builders from the multibilliondollar japanese public 
works boom 
congress late last year barred japanese firms from us 
federallyfunded public works because of lack of reciprocal access 
for american companies during his white house visit in january 
takeshita promised to seek a solution but negotiations on both 
sides of the pacific failed to produce it the united states was 
reported on the verge of initiating a formal unfair trade action 
ms winkler said mondays progress came both in defining the 
japanese public works projects to which us bids would be admitted 
and in clarifying the bidding procedure

a brother of former president chun 
doohwan has been summoned for questioning tuesday about a 
multimilliondollar scandal in a semiofficial development agency he 
once headed prosecutors reported 
kang wonil the prosecutor in charge of the case and his 
assistants said monday that chun kyunghwan 46 and three of his 
aides were to be questioned about the alleged embezzlement of up to 
14 million from the seemaul new community development program 
kang said investigators have uncovered evidence linking chun 
kyunghwan a younger brother of the expresident with 93 
million of the funds 
opposition leaders have called for investigations of other 
members of the chun family 
saemaul was founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural 
development chun kyunghwan appointed by his brother headed the 
agency from 1981 to 1987 
he has been accused of using his position to obtain donations 
sell influence and divert government funds to invest in 
profitoriented projects 
prosecutors said that last week investigators found about a 
dozen secret bank accounts the younger chun used under false names 
scores of government officials have been questioned in the case 
but prosecutors said most would face minor reprimands and not 
criminal prosecution 
opposition leader kim youngsam demanded monday that the 
investigation be expanded to cover all allegations of corruption 
involving the administration of expresident chun he was in office 
from 1980 until last month when roh taewoo was inaugurated after 
winning the presidential election in december 
the administration should not be allowed to terminate the 
investigation of chun kyunghwans scandals kim said in 
announcing his candidacy for next months national assembly 
elections 
protests about the saemaul case intensified after chun 
kyunghwan using a false name flew to osaka japan on march 18 
he returned to korea two days later for questioning 
the government probe of the scandal is seen by some political 
observers as part of an effort by roh to discredit the former 
president and his supporters who allegedly were attempting to 
maintain power within the government 
roh a former general who helped put chun in power with military 
backing promised during the presidential election campaign to root 
out official corruption

attorney general alfredo gutierrez 
marquez resigned after it was reported cocaine traffickers used an 
airfield at his brothers ranch a source at the presidents office 
said monday 
the source speaking with the condition he not be identified 
said president virgilio barco accepted the resignation 
radio stations rcn caracol and todelar had earlier reported the 
attorney generals resignation 
both the presidents press office and attorney generals office 
had declined comment when asked about a report sunday night by the 
intervision television news program the report said a 5000foot 
runway used by drug traffickers was owned by libardo gutierrez 
marquez the attorney generals brother 
the source in the presidents office told the associated press 
late monday that in his letter of resignation the attorney general 
said his brother did own a farm that news reports said had a runway 
used by drug smugglers 
caracol had said earlier the attorney general resigned shortly 
after a confiscated drug plane was stolen march 1 from a military 
air base and landed at the runway but the later radio reports said 
he quit on monday 
the government of colombia has been at virtual war with drug 
traffickers who have killed a justice minister an attorney 
general several judges two newspaper editors and scores of 
policemen and soldiers 
intervision said the runway in question was used by planes 
belonging to pablo escobar branded as a leader of the medellin 
cartel 
the cartel smuggles most of the cocaine reaching the united 
states according to the us drug enforcement administration 
the united states asked for extradition of escobar and four 
other men named as members of the medellin cartel medellin a city 
in northwest colombia is where most of colombias purported drug 
traffickers live 
the runway is on a farm near medellin next to property belonging 
to escobar intervision said 
the army last year seized a twinengine propeller plane an 
aerocommander used for drug trafficking the plane was stolen from 
an air force base on march 1 and landed at the runway owned by the 
attorney generals brother intervision said 
it said the air force tracked the plane by radar and strafed it 
other aircraft and hangars two days later army bulldozers 
destroyed the runway 
news media have said the attorney general suggested that the 
government try to reach a truce with drug traffickers 
last month at a dinner with foreign correspondents gutierrez 
was asked if he thought the government should try to reach a truce 
with the drug traffickers 
gutierrez said that would be up to the president and that his 
job is to follow the presidents orders 
the president says the government will not surrender in its war 
on drug trafficking 
in a raid last week on a country estate owned by escobar the 
army said it found tape recordings linking drug dealers with 
someone close to the attorney generals office the army gave no 
details 
the escobar home was one of five homes belonging to drug 
trafficking suspects where the army in the last two months found 
arsenals that include us military assault rifles submachine 
guns shotguns pistols ammunition hand grenades stolen license 
plates and army and police uniforms 
two of the homes were raided sunday the army said in a news 
release

a group calling itself the organization 
of arab guerrilla cells claimed responsibility monday for a gun and 
grenade attack which badly injured an italian pilot at bombay 
airport in india last week 
we claim responsibility for the attack launched against a 
group of zionist pilots working at the italian airline alitalia 
at bombay airport said a typewritten statement from the 
previously unknown group dated march 26 
the arabiclanguage statement was received monday by reuters 
news agency through a courier service in mostly moslem west beirut 
last friday an arabicspeaking man who gave his name as abbas 
mohammed ali shahadi shot and seriously wounded an alitalia pilot 
aboard an airport bus 
bombay police said the gun jammed after three or four shots and 
shahadi jumped off the bus and tossed two grenades at two offduty 
policemen the grenades failed to explode and the two officers 
chased shahadi and caught him 
the italian embassy in new delhi said police had not determined 
the gunmans nationality or motive police said he gave them only 
his hame and no identity papers were found on him 
the attack was in retaliation for the frantic campaign waged 
by the zionists and imperialists against the arab nation the 
statement said 
the breakaway palestinian faction fatahrevolutionary council 
hinted last month it would retaliate for a life sentence passed by 
an italian court on its leader the notorious abu nidal in 
absentia

a judge made creative use of the states victims 
compensation law monday and ordered a heroin dealer with extensive 
real estate holdings to pay 2 million in restitution toward drug 
rehabilitation programs 
supreme court justice lewis douglass said he reached the figure 
by multiplying the cost of drug rehabilitation by the number of 
addicts agapito lopez could have supplied with the six ounces of 
heroin seized when he was arrested 
douglass said in a telephone interview he believed it was the 
first time a state law allowing restitution for crime victims was 
used in a drug case 
defense attorney frank ortiz said he would appeal the order he 
argued that when legislators approved the restitution law they 
were thinking of crimes in which there is a specific victim like 
robbery or rape 
he also argued that the law requires a hearing to be held for 
any payment more than 10000 
lopez 44 was convicted in 1987 of drug sale and possession he 
is serving a 25yeartolife sentence imposed by douglass last year 
according to the judges calculations if the six ounces that 
were seized when lopez was arrested in 1985 had made it to the 
street and each addict bought 20 bags of heroin the six ounces 
would have gone to about 900 addicts 
douglass said he contacted drug rehabilitation agencies to find 
what the cost of the least expensive treatment would be and was 
told it was 2400 annually for outpatient care 
he said he will ask mayor edward i koch to designate a drug 
rehabilitation agency to receive the money 
lopez sold 2200 bags of heroin to an undercover officer for 
26000 and was arrested after the officer arranged for another 
sale according to nancy young a spokesman for brooklyn district 
attorney elizabeth holtzman 
at that time officers confiscated the six ounces of heroin and 
seized 440000 in cash from his apartment 
young said lopez owned at least three houses in two boroughs of 
new york city and a car dealership and other real estate in puerto 
rico 
he also had bank accounts with 60000 the district attorneys 
office will seize the assets needed to meet the restitution young

jesse jackson said monday he expects democratic leaders to 
embrace him as the nominee if he wins the most preconvention 
delegates because i would have earned it from the people 
democrat richard gephardt ended his candidacy and republican 
excandidate jack kemp climbed on george bushs bandwagon 
as democratic leaders wrestled with the implications of 
jacksons overwhelming weekend victory in michigan gephardt left 
the race for the democratic presidential nomination at a capitol 
hill news conference 
its been said the opera isnt over until the fat lady 
sings gephardt said last saturday in michigan i think i heard 
her walking to the microphone 
abc news meanwhile reported that republican bob dole was set 
to drop out tuesday the report cited campaign sources and could 
not be immediately confirmed dole has acknowledged bush is the 
almost certain nominee and had been expected to withdraw soon 
one consequence of gephardts withdrawal was to edge jackson 
ahead of massachusetts gov michael dukakis in the ap delegate 
count by one slim vote 
most of gephardts delegates were shifted into the uncommitted 
category with his withdrawal but missouri party rules mandate that 
the atlarge and public official delegates are redivided among the 
active candidates when a contender drops out that gave jackson at 
least six more delegates 
jackson now has 60655 dukakis 60555 tennessee sen albert 
gore jr 3628 sen paul simon 1685 and uncommitted 5156 
according to the ap count 
gephardt was pushed to withdraw by a thirdplace finish in 
michigans caucuses far short of the michigan miracle he 
sought to revive a candidacy that blossomed in iowas leadoff 
caucuses but was trampled in the south 
jackson and dukakis both campaigned in connecticut on the eve of 
its primary gore campaigned in new york and was joining jackson 
and simon at a debate monday night 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts was hoping his neighbor 
state would provide a victory sufficient to ease the pain of his 
loss to jackson in michigan a loss that raised questions about 
his candidacy and his abilities as a campaigner 
at a junior high school in east hartford a black student asked 
dukakis why she should vote for him over jackson 
i am not running against him and he is not running against me 
we are running for the presidency dukakis responded his answer 
running so long that he concluded by apologizing 
im sorry im making a speech instead of answering your 
question he said i hope ive persuaded you i dont know 
dukakis borrowed a favorite jackson subject urging the students 
to reject drugs his wife kitty told of her secret 26year 
amphetamine addiction 
the governor was peppered with questions about jackson but 
declined to outline any differences between himself and jackson 
because ive never done that 
i dont think the american people are particularly interested 
in what i think of the other candidates and what they think of 
me dukakis said 
gop frontrunner bush confident of winning in connecticut the 
state he grew up in began a threeday campaign swing through 
wisconsin the next battleground with primaries next week polls in 
both states put bush decisively ahead 
one of the best things that happened to me was getting my 
brains kicked out in iowa bush said everybody had me dead and 
buried so people say now things are going pretty well for you 
and they are 
kemp the new york congressman who abandoned his conservative 
candidacy two weeks ago joined bush in milwaukee to offer an 
endorsement 
george bush is going to be the nominee of the republican party 
and has earned that nomination kemp said the time has come 
for all republicans to unite behind this man who has been a fine 
and loyal vice president and to help him be the next president of 
the united states 
bushs remaining two rivals behaved as though their races were 
over even though they kept their candidacies alive 
dole all but conceding the nomination to bush spoke to 
campaign workers in washington in what sounded like a last hurrah 
though aides said he wasnt ready to withdraw 
he said the republcan party must cast off the restrictions of 
privilege and class we must offer help to those who need it we 
must support and defend civil rights 
former television evangelist pat robertson with only 17 
delegates to show for a campaign that has spent 25 million took 
the week off 
gore the tennessee democrat spoke at a congressional hearing 
in new york city on homelessness and met privately with mayor ed 
koch later he criticized secretary of state george shultz for 
meeting with surrogates of the palestine liberation 
organization 
gore said in a letter to shultz he had damaged the essential 
bond of confidence between america and the people of israel 
jackson campaigned in connecticut and considered the possibility 
other democrats were confronting that he could be the candidate 
with the most delegate votes and popular votes by the end of the 
primary season in june 
if by the end of california we have the most popular votes 
the most delegate votes becoming the nominee is logical and 
proper jackson said on abctv if i win the nomination from 
the people i expect the party to embrace me and to embrace those 
principles 
he questioned the notion that party leaders believing he cannot 
win in the general election might ignore his strength at the 
convention and give the nomination to another democrat 
they would not have given me the nomination i would have 
earned it from the people he said there is no small group no 
electoral college that can give or take your nomination if so why 
even have a primary let the people speak 
democratic chairman paul kirk said i wouldnt be a party to 
a stopjackson movement 
i cant imagine that if he runs through the process and comes 
out on top they could take it away from him kirk said i 
would refuse to be part of that 
democratic house speaker jim wright credited jackson with 
demonstrating remarkable support and surprising appeal he is 
saying things people thirst to hear

iraq on monday condemned the united 
nations sending a team to look into iranian charges of chemical 
warfare and asked the world body to instead investigate what it 
said was iranian torture of iraqi pows 
in an angry 15page letter to un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq said the 
united nations was ignoring irans own use of chemical weapons and 
letting iran drag its feet in implementing a ceasefire 
the letter delivered monday by iraqi ambassador ismat kittani 
indicated a hardening of positions on both sides in the 7yearold 
war 
iran will send an envoy to new york for talks with perez de 
cuellar this wednesday and thursday on implementing a july 20 
security council ceasefire resolution iraq will send a 
representative next week the envoys have not been named 
the resolution demands an immediate truce and return of 
prisoners of war the united states has urged the council to call 
for a worldwide arms embargo to force iran to comply with the 
ceasefire 
we ask you urgently and immediately to send a team to 
investigate the situation of iraqi prisoners of war in iran said 
the letter 
it said 10000 iraqi pows are being tortured brainwashed and 
forced to fight against their country 
it said an additional 20000 iraqis were missing in action and 
7000 more prisoners were registered with the international red 
cross but were not accounted for 
the letter criticized perez de cuellar and some security council 
members for responding first to the tehran governments complaints 
about chemical warfare 
it branded as biased and unbalanced the un chiefs 
statement friday condemning use of chemical weapons by iraq 
iraq has been condemned by the united nations four other times 
since 1984 for using chemical weapons western military analysis 
say iraq has the biggest chemical weapons armory in the region 
the us state department said recently that there was evidence 
iran may have fired chemical artillery shells into iraq 
perez de cuellar sent a team to tehran to visit hospitals and 
investigate irans charges that iraq used chemical weapons 
the iraqi letter did not confirm or deny use of chemical 
weapons but said iraq had the right to defend itself 
when each time iran sends hundreds of thousands of people to 
attack and kill us can you expect iraq to stand by with folded 
hands when barbarians try to invade it said 
the letter said since the war began in september 1980 irans 
use of chemical weapons has been documented but here there is 
no question or quick response by the secretarygeneral to 
investigate this or any aggression by iran 
aziz protested that last friday that the united nations only 
deplored the war of the cities when iraq fired missiles at 
tehran in retaliation for irans attacks on basra and baghdad 
he said that iraq has accepted the un resolution for a 
ceasefire while iran has not explicity endorsed it

bob dole stopping short of quitting the 
presidential race in what looked and sounded like a last hurrah for 
his campaign workers said monday that the republican party should 
cast off the restrictions of privilege and class 
the kansas senator made no mention of vice president george 
bush the frontrunner for the republican nomination and left the 
ballroom of a downtown hotel without talking to reporters he posed 
for individual souvenir pictures with some of his supporters 
abc news citing sources in the dole campaign said monday night 
that dole would drop out tuesday the report could not immediately 
be confirmed however 
i have stated repeatedly if my campaign did nothing else 
it would make clear that our party would never practice the 
politics of exclusion dole told 450 campaign workers and 
volunteers 
for the republican party to retain the white house we have to 
convince more women more young people americans of every color 
and ethnic background the disadvantaged the disabled 
independents and democrats not only to vote republican but to 
become committed party members he said 
the democratic party has lost its sense of purpose and its 
sense of direction in a mire of special interests but still 
only 32 percent of americans identify themselves as republicans he 
added 
to become a majority party the gop must open its doors to new 
legions of hispanic voters blacks asianamericans and other 
ethnic groups as well as bluecollar workers evangelicals and 
other conservatives who voted for ronald reagan he said 
we must cast off the restrictions of privilege and class we 
must offer help to those who need it we must support and defend 
civil rights said dole our leaders should not be timid about 
discussing issues that affect the homeless and the hungry 
dole joined by his wife elizabeth and daughter robin said 
the purpose of the gathering was to thank his campaign workers and 
to outline his vision for the future of the gop 
he joked at the outset that he stepped on my own story on 
friday when he acknowledged to reporters that his race against bush 
appears lost dole had told the us chamber of commerce its 
probably a foregone conclusion whats happening on the republican 
side 
mari maseng a dole spokeswoman said mondays speech was the 
last of three dole planned to make to stress key issues in his 
campaign foreign policy deficit reduction and the future of the 
gop 
theyre the three issues that have been most important to him 
in the campaign and why he got into the race in the first place 
theyre issues that he cares about she said 
asked if dole planned to withdraw she said hell tell us 
when he makes that decision 
dole said that i think despite the prospect of tough 
competition in the next few months i believe a republican will win 
in november but we must keep in mind that weve got a lot of work 
to do 
no doubt about it weve got miles to go before we rest and 
before we become a majority party he said

burglary and criminal damage to property said detective richard 
obermaier police located them through a pair of eyeglasses found 
at the scene he said 
we visited optical stores until we found one that remembered 
selling them to schroedl obermaier said they were a unique 
presciption the kids almost blind 
they are railroad buffs all their lives theyve talked to

king fahd said monday saudi arabia 
would pursue plans to bolster its defenses dismissing veiled 
israeli threats to the kingdom after it bought intermediaterange 
missiles capable of hitting any mideast capital 
information minister ali alshaer quoted fahd as telling his 
cabinet at a regularly scheduled meeting saudi arabia will go 
ahead with its ratified defense programs and will pursue its 
islamic mission and arab duties 
shaer said the cabinet reviewed solidarity with the kingdom 
expressed by most arab governments after repeated israeli threats 
to strike at the missiles that the kingdom has bought to defend its 
soil and sacred shrines 
saudi arabia confirmed last week it bought css2 missiles with 
a range of 2200 miles from china but said it would not put 
nuclear warheads on them 
it said it wanted to diversify its arsenal 
the kingdoms shipping lanes have been menaced by spillovers 
from the iraqiran war iran accuses saudi arabia of aiding iraq 
and has made threats against the kingdom 
the washington post said last week israel might carry out a 
preemptive strike against the missiles 
yossi ben aharon a top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
israel warned that israel had the reputation of not waiting till 
potential dangers become a reality 
he was apparently referring to israels 1981 preemptive strike 
against a nuclear reactor under construction in iraq 
saudi arabia like most arab countries is technically at war 
with israel support received by saudi arabia after the israeli 
threats included a message from egyptian president hosni mubarak 
whose country is the only arab nation to make peace with israel 
the staterun newspaper alittihad in abu dhabi capital of the 
united arab emirates reported monday that fahd would visit egypt 
on april 4 to discuss the israeli statements with mubarak it 
quoted diplomatic sources in cairo 
there was no official confirmation from cairo or riyadh

sandinista government and rebel 
negotiators met for two hours in this border outpost monday to work 
out details for a 60day ceasefire outlined in the peace accord 
they signed unexpectedly last week 
they are considering the areas where the rebels known as 
contras will gather during the truce which is to begin april 1 
under the accord signed wednesday night 
after about two hours of discussions the talks were recessed 
until tuesday and rebel leaders said there remained obstacles 
highlevel talks aimed at reaching a more permanent truce are 
scheduled for april 6 in managua the capital 
the talks were delayed by the late arrival of the contra 
negotiators who entered sapoa in midafternoon 
representatives from the leftist sandinista government were led 
by maj gen joaquin cuadra deputy defense minister and army chief 
of staff 
we come with the same spirit will and decision of the first 
meeting he told reporters 
leading the usbacked contras was aristides sanchez a 
director of the umbrella nicaraguan resistance alliance he told 
reporters the rebels presented their plan to the government and 
discussions would resume tuesday 
among the rebel representatives were walter calderon a former 
national guardsman now known as commander tono luis moreno payan 
who uses the name commander mike lima and is chief of contra 
military intelligence luis fley or commander johnson chief of 
rebel operations in northern nicaragua and diogenes hernandez 
commander fernando whose units operate in central nicaragua 
hernandez told a news conference after the meeting i want to 
tell the nicaraguan people and the world that the rebel 
combatants are not going to put down their arms until nicaragua is 
a democracy 
he said defense minister humberto ortega proposed last week that 
a marxist democracy be established but hernandez said the contras 
want a real democracy like costa rica 
cuadra declined to respond to hernandez remarks and said 
mondays talks dealt with the mechanics of the meeting he said 
the rebels made no proposals to define the zones where the contras 
would gather under a truce 
we are hoping for an agreement before april 1 he added 
a temporary ceasefire has been effect since march 21 
cuadra said there had been violations of the truce of a minor 
character but we understand that they are due to the 
communications problem 
sanchez said that in a few days the rebels will free the 
sandinistas they are holding captive he did not give details 
others in the sandinista delegation were deputy foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco and military intelligence chief maj ricardo 
wheelock roman 
on sunday the leftist sandinista government fulfilled the first 
part of the ceasefire accord by freeing 100 political prisoners 
under an amnesty program most of them were accused of activities 
linked to the contras 
afterward interior minister tomas borge called the amnesty 
possibly the beginning of the end of the 6yearold war 
after celebrating palm sunday mass roman catholic cardinal 
miguel obando y bravo called the prisoner release very positive 
during his homily the managua archbishop said the ceasefire 
agreeement did not mean we have already reached peace 
let us not make a mistake let us not confuse ourselves they 
have only signed a ceasefire he said 
under the sapoa agreement rebel forces are to gather without 
interference from sandinista forces in specified zones inside 
nicaragua during the first two weeks of april mondays talks 
between special commissions of the two sides could be extended and 
were to define the location size and modus operandi of those 
zones according to the text of the sapoa accord 
nothing is said in the sapoa agreement about the contras laying 
down their arms in past talks the rebels insisted on keeping 
their weapons until all provisions of an accord were carried out 
once rebel fighters have moved into the truce zones the contra 
leadership can send up to eight delegates to participate in 
national reconciliation talks on april 6 
last weeks pact provides a gradual amnesty for nicaraguas 
3300 political prisoners guarantees freedom of expression and 
permits all exiles to return home and participate in the political 
process 
if the peace plan is carried out nicaragua could become the 
first central american nation other than costa rica to comply fully 
with the regional peace plan signed by on aug 7

although saddled with drug 
problems of their own a number of asian countries are extending 
effective help to americans trying to stem the flow of narcotics 
into the united states senior us officials say 
the united states regards afghanistan iran laos and syria as 
patently uncooperative but the officials say such countries as 
thailand malaysia burma pakistan and china along with hong 
kong work closely with americans in cutting asian opium production 
and tracking drug shipments and dealers 
in march for example asianamerican teamwork led to the arrest 
in new york city of an alleged drug baron the us drug enforcement 
administration dea says may have smuggled up to 1 billion worth 
of heroin into the united states 
the trail of kon yuleung a highliving chinese carrying the 
passports of at least six countries reportedly had snaked down 
from the opium fields of the golden triangle of thailand burma 
and laos through hong kong and on to the united states the heroin 
was hidden in shipments of innocentlooking vases ice buckets and 
tshirts 
exchanging intelligence and tracking kon and his syndicate for 
four years were a special thai antinarcotics unit the royal hong 
kong police and some of the 80 dea agents based in asia 
in this part of the world countries have acknowledged that 
they too have an internal drug problem dea head john c lawn 
said in an interview during a conference in kuala lumpur they 
are overt in cooperating so that something can be done not only 
about the international problem but their domestic one 
opiumsmoking has long been a problem in asia because of the 
proximity of the drug but asian nations in recent years have 
cracked down hard malaysia for example has the death penalty for 
narcotics offenses 
while the greater us antinarcotics focus is currently on 
latin america and the carribean the dea has sharply revised its 
estimate of southeast asian heroin consumed by american addicts 
from 18 percent to 30 percent an additional 37 percent is said to 
originate from the socalled golden crescent iran 
afghanistan and pakistan and the rest comes largely from mexico 
also requiring shifts of tactics and possibly manpower is deas 
assertion that asian syndicates are replacing the mafia as 
wholesalers of heroin to american addicts estimated to number 
about 500000 according to the dea about 70 percent of heroin 
reaching new york city originates in southeast asia up from 4 
percent five years ago latin america is the chief source of 
cocaine 
the war against drugs in asia works both ways the united 
states for example helped set up a network of drug rehabilitation 
centers in thailand that treat some 30000 addicts a year the 
thais in turn have forged a dedicated group of antidrug lawmen who 
each year arrest more traffickers and greater quantities of drugs 
much of them bound for the united states 
we couldnt really operate without the americans said col 
viraj jutimitta widely regarded as one of thailands best 
antinarcotics officers the united states supplies one of his 
elite units the dirty dozen with radios vehicles travel 
allowances and even copying paper 
the united states also is providing aircraft and herbicides to 
spray opium fields in burma and pakistan and has helped thailands 
largely successful effort to get hill tribes people to substitute 
coffee vegetables and other crops for their traditional opium 
the us state department spends about a third of its 100 
million antinarcotics budget in asia maintaining drug 
coordinators in every embassy and 24 officers at special narcotics 
units in in thailand burma and pakistan somewhat less than a 
third of deas current 525 million budget is allocated to asia 
cooperation however stops at the frontiers of wartorn 
afghanistan and politically hostile iran and syria opium and 
heroin production in communist laos is reported soaring with the 
connivance of highlevel authorities but us officials say there 
is reluctance to impose sanctions for fear the laotian government 
will refuse to cooperate on the accounting of americans missing in 
action from the indochina war in laos 
in contrast china has moved to forge links with the 
international antinarcotics community which has detected new 
trafficking routes across its vast expanses from the golden 
triangle 
most recently authorities in china hong kong and the united 
states got together to nab a ring attempting to smuggle heroin 
stuffed inside dead ornamental fish when the drugladen gold carp 
were discovered in shanghai chinese police contacted american 
counterparts the fish were flown to their san francisco 
destination along with a senior shanghai police officer and 
subsequent arrests were made at both ends of the connection 
lawn said thaius teamwork which he rated as excellent was 
essential since thailand was the main funnel for heroin pouring out 
the golden triangle which is formed by the rugged borderlands of 
burma laos and thailand 
american agents regularly tip off the thais about suspected drug 
carriers entering their country while thai police officers have 
followed traffickers to the united states to facilitate 
investigations and arrests under a treaty now being considered 
the united states would channel a share of assets seized from 
traffickers to thailands antinarcotics program in cases where 
thai lawmen provided assistance 
when us sailors by the hundreds descend on thailands 
anythinggoes beach resort of pattaya for shore leave the two 
sides activate operation stable boy a dea agent mingles with 
the americans while thai undercover police shadow local drug 
pushers 
the leeway american agents have to operate varies among asian 
countries and there is invariably no power to arrest but a number 
of countries give dea the green light to track traffickers and 
joint operations are mounted in 1986 a dea agent on the malaysian 
island of penang posed as a drug dealer to entrap a local 
trafficker when sufficient evidence was obtained malaysian police 
moved in to make the arrest 
in thailand and the united states authorities are now after 
traffickers behind what the thais say is the worlds greatest drug 
haul 14 tons of top grade heroin seized in february in bangkok 
thailands capital 
the drugs concealed in bales of smoked rubber sheets were 
destined for new york city where their street value when cut and 
diluted would have been more than 2 billion

swisttalheimerzheim west germany ap bored with her office 
job michaela busemann went off to learn how to shoot a machine gun 
and become part of an elite group of women breaking into an 
allmale domain the west german border police 
the police are responsible for guarding the countrys borders 
including those separating west germany from the communist east 
they also provide security at federal facilities and airports 
run patrol boats along the coast in the north and baltic seas 
arrest drug smugglers and are deployed to help state police 
control unruly demonstrators 
since the federal border police force was founded in 1951 only 
men were permitted to join but last year the government permitted 
enlistment of women 
on oct 1 1987 31 women chosen from a group of 1000 
applicants began 30 months of training at swisttalheimerzheim 12 
miles west of bonn 
i was working in an office and it was boring ms busemann 
said in an interview so i joined the border police because this 
is much more interesting 
ms busemann who is 20 years old has her sights set on 
completing the tough 30month course which includes handgun and 
machine gun target practice 
the recruits also regularly train in the martial art of jujitsu 
scramble through obstacle courses and do required conditioning 
sports such as swimming and longdistance running 
in addition they have a full classroom schedule including law 
courses and other policerelated subjects 
asked how she and the other women were accepted by the men ms 
busemann said at first there were a few funny remarks but that 
ended quickly 
ms busemann is one of 29 women remaining from the 31 that began 
the training 
two of them dropped out because they kept getting homesick 
said spokesman hartmut ortlepp of border police command group west 
in bonn 
he added that when the border police opened up for women 
applicants in 1987 there were 1000 applicants for the initial 
30 slots offered 
we culled that down and finally started with 31 last 
october ortlepp said 
west germanys constitution bans women from the regular military 
services ortlepp said authorities at first had some reservations 
about women becoming part of the 20000member border police forces 
but when the women joined there was a very quick change the 
tone of the men has become more respectful more courteous its a 
change for the better said ortlepp 
the average age of the women is between 20 and 21 and they are 
more mature than the male recruits who average between 18 to 19 
ortlepp added that political opinion would play a role in what 
assignments the women receive but those completing the course 
would be considered qualified to apply for any border police 
assignment or advanced training 
that could include he said joining the gsg9 antiterrorist 
commando squad the most elite branch of the border police but 
thats a political question 
in october 1977 gsg9 commandos stormed a lufthansa airliner 
hijacked by arab terrorists to mogadishu somalia the action 
rescued 86 hostages aboard and resulted in the capture of one 
hijacker and the death of two others 
whatever assignment they get the women are still enthusiastic 
about the prospects 
its fun and there are a lot of new things to do and learn 
said 20yearold heike hartmann 
a short distance down the forest road where ms hartmann and 
the others were taking part in a field exercise 21yearold 
sybille jakoby from the saarland gave another reason for joining 
the border police 
i always wanted to do police work but i couldnt join the 
saarland state police because their minimum height for a woman is 
168 meters 5 feet 6 
but the federal border police minimum is 165 meters 5 feet 
5 and thats exactly what i am

thousands of monuments and temples from 
indias ancient past are neglected and forlorn slowly crumbling 
under the onslaught of time weather and vandals 
even the taj mahal the 17thcentury monument to love that 
perhaps is the bestknown symbol of indias past is in trouble 
its marble yellowing and cracking under the assault of fumes from a 
nearby oil refinery 
decay and disregard also blight such famed monuments as the 
domed 12thcentury temple to the hindu lord krishna here in puri 
and the erotic temple sculptures of khajuraho 
lesser known but historically no less important monuments suffer 
even more 
hundreds of poor people make their homes or even keep their 
cattle in mogul tombs others cart away chunks of monuments to 
build makeshift houses marble is scratched with uncaring visitors 
names and peepul or fig trees sprout from cracks in ancient walls 
critics attribute the disrepair to a lack of regard for history 
by most indians a large majority of whom are concerned with 
daytoday survival and a lack of will on the part of the 
government 
despite protests from environmentalist the oil refinery still 
operates near the taj mahal in agra the magnificent tomb built by 
the mogul emperor shah jahan for his favorite queen mumtaz mahal 
but even at that the taj which attracts 14 million visitors a 
year is the best preserved of indias monuments with pollution 
levels at least monitored and treatment applied to stained marble 
the famous erotic temples at khajuraho in central india are one 
of indias main tourist attractions but large parts of the temples 
are covered with moss and algae and hundreds of smaller statues 
awaiting transport to museums lie exposed to the sun and rain 
of the 85 temples built in the years 950 to 1050 only 22 
survive those are protected from vandals and treasure hunters only 
by a single barbed wire fence 
in india the archaeological survey a 125yearold government 
body looks after 3524 monuments of national importance and 
state governments are responsible for 1500 other historic 
buildings but that still leaves thousands of sites either ancient 
or notable for artistic beauty with no protection 
we try to maintain what we have in the best possible 
condition said jp joshi the archaeological surveys director 
general 
we have helped them survive ninety percent of indias ancient 
history is our contribution we have worked hard and quietly 
but conservation enthusiasts such as abhishek singhvi vice 
president of the delhi conservation society contend that the 
archaeological survey and the states simply do not have the money 
or qualified personnel to look after all the majestic remains 
this is not a priority area and funding is a perpetual 
problem singhvi said 
the survey received about 12 million for monument protection in 
198586 or an average of 284 a month for the maintenance repair 
and protection of each of the 3524 monuments on the list 
the conservationists maintain the nation as a whole has become 
complacent about its history 
at puri one of the four major hindu pilgrimage centers major 
leaks appeared in 1966 in the dome of the temple to lord krishna 
but 21 years passed before restoration started 
the work was blocked by the temples own priests who went to 
court claiming that repair would anger the gods and cause the 
temple to collapse 
local kings had covered the temple with thick plaster to save it 
from the salty sea breeze about 300 years ago in time the plaster 
began to absorb water adding enormous weight to the dome causing 
cracks and making it vulnerable said guru prashad mohanty the 
temples chief executive officer 
the court rejected the priests claims last year and hundreds 
of archaelogical survey workers now are chiseling away the old 
plaster exposing hidden statues and strengthening the temple 
not all efforts at restoration have such happy endings 
in new delhi which is a composite of seven cities built by 
different rulers dating to the 8th century some monuments simply 
disappear as modern neighborhoods overwhelm smaller tombs and 
courtyards 
singhvi said a 1913 survey listed about 1400 monuments in new 
delhi of these 400 have vanished without a trace most likely 
torn down overnight by people putting up houses he added 
new delhi which is a federal territory and not part of any 
state has no law empowering it to take over monuments and it must 
depend on the archaeological survey for conservation 
singhvi and other conservation enthusiasts say one way to raise 
money to save indias past is to raise admission prices at 
monuments maybe as much as five times current levels he said 
foreign tourists could easily pay 70 cents instead of the present 
15 cents to see the taj mahal

hardly a week goes by without reports in 
the newspapers of outbreaks of diseases among nigerias 100 million 
people yellow fever measles meningitis tetanus cholera 
polio guinea worm and others 
hundreds of thousands die each year as a result of infectious 
disease malnutrition poor sanitation and the lack of medical care 
the majority of our people do not have access to health 
care said dr olikoye ransomekuti the minister in charge of 
health for africas most populous nation 
her task is to improve the health of nigeria at a time when the 
oncewealthy oil giant has been forced to drastically cut spending 
ransomekutis approach to an array of problems is nothing short 
of a complete reform of the health care system and his program has 
won praise from the world health organization in geneva 
our priority is to establish a basic primary health care 
system he said in an interview if we can put that in place 
at least 50 to 60 percent of our health problems will be solved 
previous administrations spent millions of dollars on large 
modern hospitals for the major urban areas but most never were 
completed because of financial mismanagement and the countrys 
falling oil revenues ransomekuti said 
nigeria has joined a growing number of developing countries that 
are switching from large hospitals to a decentralized network of 
small health centers in rural and urban areas the centers focus on 
preventative measures to control diseases before they require 
expensive hospitalization or reach epidemic proportions 
the new program stresses mass immunization campaigns oral 
rehydration therapy for diarrhea africas largest childkiller 
and nutrition hygiene and family planning education it also seeks 
to provide cleaner water and human waste disposal systems 
nigerias predominantly rural population is highly susceptible 
to outbreaks of measles typhoid cholera and other diseases 
largely caused by a lack of clean drinking water and poor hygiene 
many villagers are suspicious of modern medicine preferring to 
visit traditional healers whose treatments often aggravate health 
problems 
the world health organization in geneva once assailed nigerias 
health policies but now applauds them 
nigeria has a headstart said the organizations 
representative here samuel brewgraves it has the leadership 
and the knowhow and is applying it 
about a third of the nations local government areas have been 
given 500000 naira 100000 each to set up community health 
centers ultimately all 304 local areas will be included in the 
program 
both rural and urban areas suffer from a high infant mortality 
rate 150 per 1000 live births in rural areas three in 10 
children die before age 5 in the urban areas said a 1987 health 
ministry report 
as many as 2000 nigerian children die daily due to 
malnutrition chronic undernourishment and related health problems 
urban hospitals are rundown and underequipped to deal with the 
cities burgeoning populations basic drugs are in short supply 
and the countrys lack of hard currency has made it difficult to 
buy spare parts for medical equipment 
another major problem is the low morale of doctors in the civil 
service many doctors in urban areas moonlight illegally to 
supplement their meager salaries others remain unemployed rather 
than work in the rural areas most of which lack even rudimentary 
health facilities or basic amenities for doctors families 
ransomekuti said last year he might be forced to import doctors 
from cuba and still is keeping that idea alive despite protests 
from the nigerian medical association 
my aim is to get health services to the people if nigerian 
doctors show unwillingness to serve im willing to use health 
personnel from any country he said 
ransomekutis younger brother beko also a doctor is vice 
president of the medical association he said there should be no 
need to import doctors 
if the amount of money spent on foreign doctors was offered to 
nigerians they wouldnt be short of people applying he said 
the government seems to think patriotism and nationalism are 
enough to get people to the rural areas incentives need to be 
given to attract doctors there 
but the health minister said it is in his plans to do that 
explaining that comfortable housing electricity running water and 
adequate schooling for doctors children will be provided in rural 
posts 
once these services are delivered the doctors will find their 
place in the rural areas he said

for 2 or so you can hungrily cradle a barrel 
of popcorn while watching characters in babettes feast ravish 
blini with black caviar quail stuffed with foie gras and other 
magnificent morsels in what has to be one of the most inspiring 
meals ever shown on the screen 
for 88 more you can follow this feast for the eyes with one 
for the body 
one thing will happen after you see this movie you will be 
starving said dro e proudian general manager at petrossian 
inc whose restaurant is one of several around the the country 
serving the sevencourse feast during the run of the movie 
denmarks entry for an academy award as best foreign film 
when you see the film how complicated the meal is how 
expensive all the marketing there will be a greater 
understanding of the art of preparing a great meal said yannick 
cam chef and owner at le pavillion in washington which begins 
serving the feast in april 
the movie based on a story by isak dinesen tells of two 
unmarried and pious sisters who take a french political refugee 
babette into their home on the bleak coast of norway in return 
for housekeeping fourteen years later when babette wins 10000 
francs in the lottery she repays them with a feast so strange to 
them that one sister in anticipation compares it to a witchs 
sabbath 
but babette fills the hearts as well as the bellies of her 12 
guests mostly members of the sisters religious community 
it was a whole experience thats why we did it said stella 
geller of west orange nj who with her husband followed the film 
with dinner recently at petrossian i didnt leave a bite of 
anything i ate every bite 
so far plans have been made for the feast at restaurants in 
philadelphia miami los angeles washington san francisco and 
laguna niguel calif according to alfred rosenthal orion 
classics gastronomic consultant for the dinners prices will vary 
slightly with 80 the lowest without wines he said 
that will buy turtle soup blini with black caviar quail 
stuffed with foie gras baked in a pastry nest with truffle sauce 
salad cheeses rum cake with candied fruit fresh fruit coffee 
add 35 for four wines 
as the movie opens in more cities theater owners and 
restaurateurs can use a guide written by rosenthal to help them 
present the feast and find such ingredients as turtle meat 
while the meal is expensive proudian called it a bargain 
noting the normal prices of just three ingredients 30 grams of 
fresh russian sevruga caviar 21 2 ounces of fresh foie gras 
15 threequarters of an ounce of black truffle 30 
the people who come here are adventurous a lot of romantic 
people proudian said in a recent interview at petrossian a 
mirrored and marbled restaurant near carnegie hall 
to meet their expectations and recreate the sense of abundance 
evident on babettes table he said the caviar has to be 
heaping you have to see the truffles not just a speck here a 
slice there when you put your knife into the quail you have to 
feel the foie gras 
it was extraordinarily difficult because we had to recreate a 
visual image on a plate he said 
petrossians chef michel attali said he encountered one 
problem in the film the quail is served sitting in its pastry 
nest with the head on believing that would not be acceptable here 
attali fashioned pastry heads for the tiny game birds 
but no matter how faithful diners will not experience the same 
mood as in the film cam said first the house in the film and 
it was a little religious dinner i dont think we can reproduce 
that 
still proudian said the star of the movie is the food so if 
you are in this business its nice to see all of this dignity and 
respect given to the preparation of food

whipping up the crowd of 1500 supporters 
jeanmarie le pen paints a picture of a decadent declining and 
endangered france a tower of babel overrun by north african 
immigrants perhaps even becoming an islamic republic 
what he has been campaigning for in the presidential elections 
april 24 is a french france 
the first man to announce his candidacy le pen has been 
pounding out that message for a year 
as the balloting draws nearer le pens message is being heard 
and his prediction that immigration will be a key campaign issue 
appears to be coming true two main conservative candidates have 
picked up on it but not to le pens extremes in hopes of winning 
over his followers in runoff balloting may 8 
today we are in great danger le pen told his audience in 
this communistcontrolled town in the northern picardy region 
france is suffering a demographic loss a moral loss a religious 
loss and when you lose the instinct for life you condemn 
yourself to death 
like a fire and brimstone preacher the ruddy silverhaired 
breton uses his considerable oratorial skills to shock taunt 
cajole his listeners then he homes in on his favorite fears 
immigration insecurity drugs aids and extols his favorite 
virtues god family and france 
the renaissance of france must come through drastic 
measures said the 59yearold fishermans son 
if elected le pen says he will amend the constitution to allow 
for referendums on social issues for frances 55 million people 
then hold a vote to send large portions of noneuropean immigrants 
home reinstitute the death penalty for drug traffickers and 
terrorists and quarantine aids victims 
critics charge that le pen a onetime paratrooper in indochina 
and algeria is a fascist racist and antisemite which he denies 
and that his national front encourages xenophobia 
although running fourth in opinion polls which give him about 
10 percent of the vote le pen has become an important electoral 
factor 
president francois mitterrand a socialist is favored for 
reelection consistently garnering about 38 percent in the opinion 
polls for the first round of balloting april 24 that kind of 
turnout for mitterrand however would mean hed have to face a 
runoff may 8 against the top conservative candidate 
thus for the divided right le pen can be a spoiler 
both of the two main conservative candidates premier jacques 
chirac of the neogaullist rally for the republic party and former 
premier raymond barre backed by the centerright union for french 
democracy need le pens voters in the runoff 
chirac and barre who until recently shunned le pens 
controversial themes began addressing the issues in march on 
visits to the heavilyimmigrant mediterranean port of marseille in 
the heart of the national fronts southern stronghold 
no one has ever reproached me for being xenophobic or 
racist chirac told a crowd march 10 but developments which we 
have recently witnessed have led a certain number of our citizens 
to feelings of this kind if i cannot condone it i can understand 
it 
on march 24 barre told a crowd of about 10000 the national 
interest consists firstly of effectively stopping noneuropean 
immigration not for reasons of principle but because of economic 
and demographic circumstances 
to me what we must do appears clear respect human rights but 
at the same time defend the national interest 
about 45 million foreigners live in france of whom 15 million 
are moslem arabs from the north african nations of algeria tunisia 
and morocco the remainder are people of european descent and 
blacks from frances former african colonies 
immigrants have become a sensitive subject as the nation 
outgrows its need for cheap foreign labor an attempt to revise the 
nationality code to make it more difficult for immigrants to become 
french was dropped at the approach of elections 
le pen founded the national front in 1972 but its political 
awakening did not come until 1984 when the party took 11 percent of 
the vote in elections for the european parliament and seated 10 
deputies the same number as the communists its entree into 
national politics came in the march 1986 legislative elections 
which gave the national front 35 seats in frances national 
assembly 
le pen says he will wait until may 1 to tell his supporters how 
to vote or whether to vote in the runoff 
however he insists he still has an outsiders chance of 
being the top conservative votegetter april 24 
i dont believe in the polls he said people dont dare 
say theyll vote for us theyre afraid

wherever theres a little spot for 
a flower theres a flower owe bodentien was saying as he stood 
on the muddy soil of a deserted tivoli park where he is the head 
gardener 
like gardeners everywhere in the northern hemisphere this time 
of year his work is just beginning and he has 20 acres to worry 
about 
the policy is to have something new and something old but not 
too much of each bodentien said of his 10 years in what he calls 
the best gardening job in denmark 
first we plant about 25000 to 30000 violets and 
forgetmenots in blue pink and white with tulips in between 
people should do that in their gardens too because when the 
tulip bulbs are finished you have another flower underneath 
although the park is open barely a third of the year as many as 
5 million people stream through each summer season for the 
amusement rides the food the music the theater or just to look 
at the flowers 
entrepreneur georg carstensen got royal permission to found the 
park in 1843 the story goes that he told king christian viii 
when people are amusing themselves they do not think about 
politics 
for many who visit tivoli the gardens are the main attraction 
bodentien makes a regular buying trip to the keukenhof gardens 
showcase of the dutch flower bulb industry outside the hague in the 
netherlands tivoli buys practically all its flowers from such 
specialized suppliers spending the kroner equivalent of 313000 a 
year on plants alone 
by modern amusement park standards tivoli is tiny so every 
inch counts the garden plan has 10 pages of ledgersized entries 
detailing what is planted where 
this years plan calls for 68000 tulips of 100 different 
varieties from dreaming maid to black hero 
the gardening staff of nine which expands to as many as 17 in 
the summer will also be tending 42300 pearl hyacinths and 
anemones 3800 narcissi and easter lilies 50000 cut 
chrysanthemums and 100000 potted plants of other kinds 
january and february is the time for pruning trees some of 
which are older than the park itself 
i must admit that trees are my big passion bodentien said 
flowers are easily bought but trees take centuries 
tivolis chestnuts elms and lime trees are seldom felled and 
when they must be they are replaced they grow from walls poke 
through restaurant ceilings and stick up around the winding tracks 
of the rides 
tivolis lone california redwood a gift from the danish 
brotherhood in california in 1968 is growing at the northern limit 
for the species bodentien said 
an american tourist was astonished to see a banana tree bearing 
fruit in this northern latitude he said 
i heard him tell his wife it was plastic so i picked one and 
gave it to him to eat 
bodentien and his crews are in a rush now to have everything in 
order and in bloom by opening day april 27 
in 1983 bodentien won a guinness record certificate for the 
biggest chrysanthemum display 370000 blooms hes always coming 
up with new ideas for the parks designs 
i get my inspiration all over he said at home in a chair 
or out walking on the street or maybe talking to people about 
something totally different and suddenly it comes 
the park has to look as fine on the last day of the season 
as on the first day we are changing all the time

alarmed by the fast spread of aids in the 
country mexican authorities have begun a campaign called cascade 
education a novel approach that enlists those most likely to be 
afflicted to spread the word 
the campaign is aimed directly at male and female prostitutes 
the homosexual community street gangs and the poor in the hope 
that what they learn about aids prevention will cascade down to 
others in their own vernacular 
most of the effort is concentrated in mexico city a metropolis 
of 18 million people where highrisk people are hard to reach 
through newspapers and other standard means 
we are teaching them to become health care promoters and 
sending them into their communities said dr glorias ornellas 
hall director of the national center for aids information an arm 
of the federal public health department 
we believe that using the media to give information is not 
enough to change behavior patterns only facetoface contact can 
do that she said the best way is for them to reach their own 
communities in their own language that includes prostitutes 
reaching out to prostitutes homosexuals to homosexuals even 
deafmutes to deafmutes 
according to the center mexico had 1126 confirmed aids cases 
as of feb 1 and the number is doubling every seven months for 
every confirmed case an additional 50 to 100 people are becoming 
exposed to the virus said dr jaime sepulveda amor the 
departments director of epidemiology 
sepulveda who is also president of the governments national 
commission on aids prevention estimated during a recent interview 
the number of people confirmed to have aids will reach over 25000 
by 1991 making it the second or third leading cause of death for 
people in the 25 to 44 age group in mexico which has a population 
estimated at 817 million 
in the united states the number of aids cases reported since 
june 1981 has reached 57024 
since it was founded last year the information center has 
broadcast its services on radio and television and through bumper 
stickers posters keychains and matchbooks with condoms attached 
mexico recently received a donation of 10 million condoms from the 
us agency for international development 
th center also has trained dozens of mexico city residents in 
its cascade education program offering instructional rclasses but 
leaving the actual teaching process to each individual 
we give them the basics then leave the style of presentation 
in their own hands ornellas said 
the centers staff also trains streetgang leaders and visits 
jails to teach police officials and prisoners 
ornellas said many of the cascade volunteers from the streets 
originally visited the center to be tested for the aids virus and 
with counselling and support have joined the program she said the 
best of them are those who have tested positive 
one male prostitute in the program only known by his nickname 
of jaimito regularly visits mexico city markets to sing a 
ranchero song he wrote and recorded called what is aids 
ornellas called jaimito one of our great promoters 
a deaf mute who also is a male prostitute is another is cascade 
promoter 
he uncovered a whole subculture of deaf mutes who prostitute 
themselves off to make a living ornellas said we found that 
many feel they have no other way to earn money 
an initial health department survey indicated that about 30 
percent of the male homosexual community in mexico city has been 
exposed to the aids virus gerardo ortega zurita a cascade 
volunteer leader said cultural prejudices have made it very 
difficult for homosexual men to seek help 
theres incredible discrimination against homosexuals who are 
isolated from the centers of the country ortega said teaching 
them about aids is difficult they are forced to hide from the 
police and other government authorities 
ortega brings youths from what he calls controlled groups of 
prostitutes to the center to be examined and learn about aids 
prevention 
but there are others we cant get to who are more preoccupied 
with making a living than with taking care of their lives he 
said 
ornellas and other health officials say the cascade approach is 
essential not only in reaching previously hidden subcultures but in 
confronting many myths about aids 
weve come across many beliefs ornellas said some say 
aids is punishment from god and others that witchcraft can ward 
it off in a country with cultural setbacks that include religious 
beliefs ignorance and cultural taboos that do not allow the use of 
condoms we found that this program has worked 
currently ornellas said the center is receiving 50 visits and 
100 telephone queries a day from people wanting to find out about 
aids 
its new that they should come out at all she said 
the very lowest class is the most at risk and the hardest to 
get to theres a disrespect for life among them they dont care 
if they die 
as in other countries in latin america the center had to 
overcome initial resistance from the roman catholic church in 
distributing literature and promoting the use of condoms 
clerics are one way of reaching rural areas ornellas said 
we havent even started with rural people where you have 
whole families living in a single room children learn about sex in 
one room whats going to happen when aids reaches these rural 
areas

one of the thousands of small commuter 
buses that careen about kenya every day carries an appropriate 
bumper sticker you never know heaven could be nearer than 
home 
authorities say the overcrowded poorly maintained wildly 
driven buses called matatus have contributed heavily to kenyas 
highway death toll of nearly 200 so far this year 
at that rate the toll is roughly on pace with 1987 when 1889 
people died in traffic accidents or one person killed for every 
166 cars on kenyas roads a similar rate in the united states 
would mean that annual highway fatalities now fewer than 50000 
would reach more than 1 million a year 
the privately owned matatus carry such names as survival of 
the fittest and living devil 
scary as it all may be the poor people who use them have no 
other choice 
the brightly colored vehicles are legally allowed to carry no 
more than 25 passengers but usually matatu crews cram in twice 
that many or more to get more fares those who cant fit inside 
climb onto the roof and cling to luggage as the buses go into a 
list on highspeed turns 
thirtyone people were killed feb 29 in a threematatu crash 
that incensed a nation already accustomed to headlines screaming of 
horror smashes and matatu madness 
for days after the crash newspapers printed pictures of victims 
strewn across the road and of the crumpled matatus 
commentaries called for something to be done about matatus and 
a roadsafety program was reintroduced on the governments voice of 
kenya television 
the head of the matatu association of kenya resigned rather he 
said than be cursed by the innocent blood of the commuters who 
die daily on our roads at the hands of reckless matatu drivers 
president daniel arap moi whose government in 1984 passed the 
first legislation aimed at controlling matatus decided they had 
become more an agent of death and destruction than an asset to 
the commuter 
police began a crackdown netting hundreds of unroadworthy and 
overcrowded vehicles matatu crews as well as unseated passengers 
were hit with heavy fines 
the ministry of transport issued a new and more stringent list 
of regulations and ordered all matatu drivers retested 
but the matatu industry retaliated with a strike that stranded 
hundreds of thousands of people moi rescinded the retesting order 
and the matatus returned after a day off the roads 
mois response to the strike underscored the matatu industrys 
stranglehold on the nations transportation sector 
less than 1 percent of kenyas 22 million people own cars and 
fewer than 600 buses are on the roads the lack of vehicles leaves 
a demand for transportation met by the tens of thousands of 
matatus which mostly are vans and minibuses that travel even the 
most rural routes 
matatus first appeared as pirate taxis in the mid1950s when 
kenya was a british colony and movement by the native population 
was restricted 
the industry burgeoned after independence in 1963 when 
restrictions were lifted and people were allowed to move to the 
cities swelling metropolitan populations and increasing the need 
for public transport 
the name matatu comes from the kikuyu term mangotore 
matatus meaning 30 kenyan cents which at that time was the 
standard matatu fare 
today the average fare around nairobi is 3 shillings 19 us 
cents and routes are flexible 
to increase profits and their own 40 to 75 monthly salaries 
matatu crews overload the buses work overly long hours at the 
wheel and drive at high speeds in order to meet daily quotas set by 
matatu owners 
at least 80 percent of the matatu crews work sevenday weeks and 
average 10 hours a day in vehicles that suffer most often from 
engine brake or gearbox failure according to a 1982 study by the 
nairobibased mazengira institute 
many drivers admit to chewing khat a stimulative twig or 
smoking marijuana to keep themselves alert 
in one of the dozens of commentaries on matatus a columnist for 
the daily nation kenyas leading newspaper blamed greed 
brainless bravado and showmanship for the road carnage caused by 
matatus 
the nation should not allow lunatics to ply the roads any 
longer the columnist said

editors note the academy awards ritual returns to an ancient 
venue with a wideopen contest among nominated performers cher 
glenn close sally kirkland will michael douglas win the oscar 
that has eluded his father itll all be settled monday night on 
the stage of the cavernous shrine auditorium 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
oscar moves to a newold location monday 
night for the 60th academy awards which are expected to be 
dominated by the last emperor bernardo bertoluccis epic of 
modern china 
the venerable shrine auditorium where the awards were presented 
in 1946 and 1947 will again be the site of hollywoods grandest 
affair the last emperor has been labeled the favored picture 
at the ceremonies especially since bertolucci won the directors 
guild award the directors have proven uncanny in presaging the 
oscars deviating only three times in 40 years 
broadcast news was an early favorite but its vogue seems to 
have faded moonstruck has proven extremely popular at the box 
office and could stage a surprise victory less likely are the 
other two nominees fatal attraction and hope and glory 
the nominated performances afford a wideopen contest 
particularly among the actresses both cher moonstruck and 
glenn close fatal attraction have their champions as does 
sally kirkland anna who collected several critics awards 
also nominated are holly hunter broadcast news and meryl 
streep ironweed 
michael douglas delivered two strong performances in 1987 in 
fatal attraction and wall street the latter bringing his 
nomination he might well win the oscar a feat that has eluded his 
father kirk 
marcello mastroianni dark eyes might be honored for his 
long distinguished career then again academy voters might 
finally recognize comedy and reward robin williams for good 
morning vietnam also nominated are previous winners jack 
nicholson ironweed and william hurt broadcast news 
the supporting performance categories are equally impressive 
for supporting actress norma aleandro gaby anne archer 
fatal attraction olympia dukakis moonstruck anne ramsey 
throw momma from the train ann sothern the whales of 
august 
for supporting actor albert brooks broadcast news sean 
connery the untouchables morgan freeman street smart 
vincent gardenia moonstruck denzel washington cry 
freedom 
among the directors bertolucci appears the solid favorite 
other probables louis malles au revoir les enfants for 
foreign language film and ive had the time of my life from 
dirty dancing for original song 
the 60th academy awards have proven remarkably free of 
controversy at least in the nomination stages the one 
eyebrowraiser was the failure to nominate james l brooks as best 
director for broadcast news since brooks wrote directed and 
produced the film that was nominated for best picture and for three 
of its actors how could his direction go unmentioned another 
academy mystery 
monday nights ceremonies will be televised abctv 9 pm edt 
from the stage of the shrine auditorium an ancient cavern a few 
blocks from the los angeles memorial coliseum the move from the 
marble and crystal los angeles music center might seem like a step 
backward but the academy governors had their reasons 
for years producers have smarted over the limited rehearsal 
time afforded by the music center which also houses symphonies and 
operas also the limited seating capacity of 3400 didnt allow 
the academy to accommodate members requests for tickets 
the shrine holds 6308 and at 150 for the best seats and 300 
for the board of governors ball in the adjacent exhibition hall 
the event can supply muchneeded funds for the academy 
oscar has wandered over a large portion of los angeles county 
during 60 years the first event was held on may 16 1929 in the 
blossom room of the hollywood roosevelt hotel the 270 film 
industry leaders who attended paid 5 a head to dine on squab and 
lobster no booze in those prohibition times 
for the next 14 years the golden statuettes were presented at 
relatively intimate industry dinners in two hotel ballrooms the 
ambassadors coconut grove and the biltmore bowl oldtimers view 
those events with great nostalgia they were warm friendly 
gatherings during an era when hollywood had a sense of community 
the war changed that in 1944 formal dinners seemed incongruous 
with wartime austerity the dinners were abandoned for the 
graumans chinese theater which could accommodate servicemen 
guests with its 2258 capacity no black tie or formal gowns 
either they were considered unpatriotic 
after three years at the chinese the academy sought a bigger 
house moving to the shrine auditorium then in 1949 came the nadir 
of oscars fortunes 
from the beginning of the academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences the major studios supplied financing then in 1949 amid 
claims by some critics that the studios were upset by the academys 
frequent rewarding of european films the studios withdrew their 
support they claimed they did so to avoid criticism that they 
overly influenced voting 
totally broke the academy was forced to present the 21st awards 
in its own 985seat screening theater once a neighborhood movie 
house the studios resumed their support and for the next 11 years 
the awards were presented at the artdeco pantages theater on 
hollywood boulevard 
seeking greater capacity the academy awards moved out of los 
angeles for the first time in l961 settling into the santa monica 
civic auditorium for the next eight years the location a couple of 
blocks from the pacific prompted bob hope to comment the losers 
can walk into the ocean 
in 1969 oscar began a 20year run in the dorothy chandler 
pavilion of the music center now the awards follow the grammys to 
the shrine which also attracted this years emmys from their 
longtime base at the pasadena civic auditorium

if the academy awards had been given in 
december instead of april the winner might well have been 
broadcast news 
thats the way it looks to this oscarwatcher james l brooks 
funny insightful look at the madness of the television news 
business was the talk of hollywood but after a few weeks the talk 
diminished and broadcast news did not become the boxoffice 
smash that some had predicted 
suddenly the last emperor began drawing more respect as 
drama it may have been wanting but his fellow filmmakers admired 
bernardo bertoluccis achievement in fulfilling such a difficult 
project with style and class hence the last emperor appears 
the favorite to win as best picture and for bertoluccis direction 
here is an estimate of the acting categories 
best actress again holly hunter of broadcast news was the 
early favorite but she pulled a vanishing act while cher appeared 
on a halfdozen magazine covers for exposure alone please no 
puns cher looks like the winner for moonstruck her 
performance was widely admired besides 
best actor it looks like the year of michael douglas no more 
the nice guy he was impressive as the boeskylike inside trader in 
wall street 
best supporting actress ann sothern would be the sentimental 
choice for the whales of august but the likely winner is 
olympia dukakis of moonstruck 
best supporting actor a spirited race but here sentiment is 
likely to prevail sean connery for the untouchables

particular cactus was uprooted illegally they dont have brands on 
them you know the crooks are aware of this and thats why its 
big business this time we got lucky 
big business yes though not in comparison with the traffic in 
drugs or even illegal birds smuggled through the american 
southwest but these states are facing dwindling water supplies and 
are encouraging developers resort operators and homeowners to turn 
to desert plants for their landscaping as a result the legal 
trade in cactus in arizona just one state has grown to about 2 
million a year the illegal trade according to state experts is 
probably half again as much the cactus in the nursery had a 
sticker price as it were of 15000 
moreover the sleuths who pursue cactus rustlers seem every bit 
as determined as yesterdays cattlerustler posses and todays 
narcotics detectives and the crime just as pernicious 
they view the illegal ripping of a fragile plant out of a 
fragile desert as a desecration a ruthless violation of a 
cathedral of nature all they have to do is look south across the 
mexican border to see the unholy bleakness of the very same desert 
practically laid bare by cactus rustlers and smugglers 
such was their dedication that luck played only a minor role in 
catching the thieves who stole the great cactus that wound up in 
the las vegas nursery 
that capture came about because of an observant naturelover 
from oregon whose outrage set on the thiefs trail wildlife agents 
from three states and the federal government their hunt took eight 
months it led to the nations first and only felony conviction to 
date for the crime of cactus rustling 
of all the 5000 varieties of cactuses the one that comes to 
mind with the very word is the saguaro cereus giganteus the giant 
of the desert pronounced suhwahrow 
if you see saguaros growing in the wild you are looking at 
southern arizona their only natural home on this planet if you 
see them at sunset the needles covering their giant torsos and 
uplifted arms reflect an aura of gold in moonlight silver they 
seem to possess a mystical quality 
the papago indians who harvest cactus fruit to make wine and 
jelly call saguaros the old men the residents of quartzsite 
ariz had a special name for the one tracked to that nevada 
nursery old granddad 
a saguaro grows only an inch or less a year in the arid desert 
that would make old granddad 200 years old saguaros dont even 
develop their characteristic arms until they are at least 70 
old granddad stood in utter remoteness 20 miles east of 
quartzsite an old stagecoach stop on what is now i10 but old 
granddad which stood there before the first stagecoach arrived 
wasnt visible from any paved road 
roy and rosslee crockett from baker ore heard about the 
majestic saguaro when they first wintered near quartzsite back in 
1977 
it was not like any other saguaro we had ever seen mrs 
crockett said she and roy of course took snapshots of each other 
standing next to old granddad each winter thereafter the crocketts 
drove their camper to southwestern arizona and each year made a 
trip out to visit old granddad and make snapshots 
and indeed it was like no other saguaro they had seen or were 
likely to see 
it was a crested saguaro the rarest of the rare according to 
victor gass curator of the desert botanical gardens in phoenix 
maybe one saguaro in 200000 develops a crest and old granddad had 
the most developed crest gass or any of his colleagues had ever 
seen 
a crest is a fanshaped growth on the top of the plants main 
stem it is actually a deformity a botanical aberration called 
fasciation nobody knows what causes it it occurs only in the 
wild and cant be reproduced in a nursery on this particular 
saguaro the crest measured more than 6 feet across and 4 feet tall 
on roy and rosslee crocketts ninth winter in quartzsite old 
granddad was gone 
we didnt know what to do or what to think rosslee crockett 
said the more i thought about it the madder i got finally i 
called the sheriff 
the following day mrs crocketts report reached alex leivas an 
agent of the arizona agricultural and horticultural commission 
whose district encompasses quartzsite and whose duties include that 
of cactus cop as they are known in the state 
she led him to the hole in the ground where the old cactus had 
stood leivas found some tire tracks and took some pictures she 
showed him her own pictures of old granddad 
i had figured it was just another saguaro leivas said 
when i saw her pictures i thought wow i had never seen such a 
crested saguaro

<TEXT>
leivas returned to the site with survey maps and confirmed his 
suspicion that it was on land controlled by the bureau of land 
management federal land and phoned keeler the us fish and 
wildlife agent 
then he recalled a transit notice he had received earlier 
from a border agent in california information the two states 
exchange when native plants are transported across state lines to 
uproot a protected plant legally requires a permit from the state 
and a metal tag affixed to the plant 
the notice said that a load of cactuses duly tagged had passed 
through vidal junction calif on a flatbed truck feb 3 it 
mentioned no crested saguaro but as leivas discovered later the 
saguaro had been hidden beneath other varieties of especially 
prickly plants concealed as if by barbed wire the notice said the 
load was bound for las vegas the carrier listed as rattlesnake 
ranch near wenden ariz 
leivas decided to check it out meanwhile he had mrs 
crocketts pictures made into a sort of wanted poster like a 
missingchild bulletin in a supermarket and mailed a copy to every 
border checkpoint in arizona california nevada and new mexico 
he also sent a poster to john jones of the nevada division of 
forestry in las vegas and told him about the load of cactuses 
jones immediately recognized the picture of the crested saguaro as 
one that recently arrived at cactus king a leading nevada nursery 
but a picture is not as the cops say a positive id so 
keeler and leivas arranged to drive the 300 miles to las vegas with 
mr and mrs crockett and have them take a look 
there it is roy crockett cried even before they pulled 
into the nursery 
said linda akers the assistant us attorney who prepared the 
case for trial it was the only plant lineup ive ever heard of 
i mean mr and mrs crockett do you recognize any plant among 
that bunch you have to admit its bizarre 
it turned out the deal had been made through a middleman a 
broker and the the nursery owner was unaware that it was illegal 
the thief sold it for 1300 to the broker who resold it to the 
nursery for 1500 that would be about the markup for any saguaro 
this size but this crested beauty was special 
after it was here a week i was offered 7500 said the 
nursery owner jeff meckley obviously i wasnt going to let it 
go for the first offer but the truth is i didnt want to sell it 
at all thats why i marked it up to 15000 it was so magnificent 
i wanted to keep it myself 
meckley disappointed bundled up old granddad with loving care 
and proper equipment he hauled it to where keeler had arranged for 
its keeping the desert botanical gardens in phoenix 
it is no easy job to move a giant saguaro without damage 
internal or external they are deceptively heavy storing enough 
water within to last as long as four years without a refill this 
one weighed two tons transporting one safely involves hydraulic 
hoists and slings and padded cradles the thief had used none 
now keeler and leivas had their cactus but not their case 
the cactus was tagged with a legitimate tag no 10108 it was 
issued to glen and karen clontz of the rattlesnake ranch on jan 
10 1986 it authorized them to dig cactuses along a 100footwide 
rightofway for an oil pipeline across the arizona desert 
the only time permission is given to uproot any of arizonas 212 
species of protected plants from state or federal land which 
constitutes 87 percent of arizona soil is when they are in 
certain danger of being destroyed by such a project 
keeler found rattlesnake ranch out in the middle of nowhere 
in a place known as butler valley the ranch turned out to be a 
trailer and a few other beatup vehicles no electricity no 
running water 
the clontzes admitted they had dug the crested cactus they 
maintained that they had saved it in the nick of time from the 
pipeline bulldozers keeler noticed a dozen saguaros scattered 
about with no tags and also an immature redtailed hawk a 
protected bird which he found starving to death in a cage he took 
the pitiful creature to a rehabilitation center in phoenix 
whos to say precisely where a cactus was taken keeler 
said he claimed it came from the pipeline path without the 
crocketts photos we didnt have much of a case 
so keeler took the photos out to the site and stood in the exact 
spot where the crocketts had stood and snapped his own pictures 
the backgrounds matched only old granddad was missing a mile 
from the pipeline that sewed it up 
the evidence was so overwhelming said us attorney akers 
that we let the clontzes plead guilty and saved the expense of a 
trial 
under arizona law cactus rustling is a misdemeanor under 
federal law it is a felony and this was the first time the 
government had had the evidence to make it stick in recognition 
the crocketts received a 2000 reward 
on feb 23 1987 a year and a day after rosslee crockett 
reported the missing saguaro to the sheriff glen and karen clontz 
were each fined 250 and he was sent off to the federal 
penitentiary in boron calif where he served six months of a 
twoyear sentence both were put on five years supervised probation 
and forbidden to deal in plants for that period 
when i called the sheriff said mrs crockett i thought 
he would just scold somebody and make them put it back now i know 
what it means to make a federal case out of something 
the baby hawk died 
so at last did the cactus 
gass of the botanical gardens said the great plant had 
suffered more knocking around than it could enduresomething had 
gotten inside it some form of bacteria he said we have kept 
the crest to study it 
so they have it rests on soft grass in the shade and is 
magnificent in its size a rotting relic of desert glory destroyed

editors note a decade ago writer robert campbell made the 
switch from screenplays to mysteries nothing much happened for a 
time then in 1986 he won an edgar the mysterywriting 
equivalent of an oscar campbells been writing up a storm ever 
since 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
robert campbell is having such a good time with 
the renaissance of his writing career that there are rainy sundays 
when he sits at his home computer and writes instead of making 
himself take the day off 
campbell studied to be a painter but instead became a hollywood 
screenwriter he was nominated for an academy award for man of 
1000 faces and wrote machine gun kelly and masque of the 
red death 
my film career was not that illustrious he says i made a 
lot of money is about what it amounted to 
ten years ago on a visit to carmel calif he says i went 
to the end of ocean avenue to look at the sunset and suddenly 
realized i had literally been starved for visual beauty i wasnt 
in town three days when i knew i was moving you cant write 
screenplays from there i wrote two after i got there neither 
picture was ever made 
he bought a tiny house and started writing murder mysteries he 
wrote two he was proud of the spy who sat and waited set in 
world war i and fat tuesday set in new orleans nothing much 
happened 
then his junkyard dog published in 1986 won an edgar 
given by the mystery writers of america as best original paperback 
it launched my mystery career campbell says everything 
sort of exploded all at once my name was suddenly known among the 
mystery people almost overnight now it has spread out i 
understand to the general population as well 
he exploded like a geyser in 1987 he wrote five books 
he now has three heroes going 
his newest is jake hatch in plugged nickel which pocket 
books published in march it introduces a detective for the 
burlington northern railroad based in omaha neb who has a lady 
friend in nearly every station 
i always wanted to do a nostalgic detective who has a 
connection with the railroads campbell says he does things 
for decent reasons he stands for a time when america was innocent 
and when railroads were the principal way of getting around he 
currently is writing jake hatchs second adventure red cent 
he intends to make his other two series sort of dignified 
novels of social injustice jimmy flannery is a political precinct 
captain in chicago hes an ombudsman for the little guy whistler 
a private detective operates out of la which i call lala land 
flannery came first for publisher new american library in 
junkyard dog then starred in the 600pound gorilla 
hipdeep in alligators and a new one thinning the turkey 
herd all have a murder and a subplot 
the second plot has to do with flannery by a tricky device 
coming off triumphant over a political reality i have a lot of fun 
figuring those out campbell says 
in the whistler series he says i write books as tough as any 
being written today mysterious press published in lala land 
we trust then campbell moved to poseidon press for alice in 
lala land he is finishing sweet lala land and plans the 
wizard of lala land 
im not going to drop the character or the locale but im not 
going to have lala in the title any more my thought is when they 
go to paperback to bring them out as a boxed set and call it the 
lala land quartet 
though not a crusader campbell shows his fury at child 
pornography in in lala land we trust he calls the book a 
hard dose to take and adds but thats the way it is im not 
overexpressing i knew policemen in los angeles years ago i 
talked to one who said i know of people who can deliver on your 
doorstep a child boy or girl do with them as you will no 
questions asked for 2500 campbell took care to write so as 
not to titillate people attracted to child pornography 
i dont believe in censorship but i think part of the 
development of human societies has been the ability to make hard 
choices where your right to express yourself impacts on my right to 
be kept safe from harm he says 
there ought to be a way even with freedom of speech where we 
can stop child porn publications the first amendment protection 
doesnt impress me 
he has written and sold juice not in a series to simon and 
schuster for publication in 1990 series can wear you out he 
says but he started them deliberately because a certain amount 
of income is assured 
but the most felicitous thing about making a living writing is 
to make some contribution of excellence somewhere along the line or 
to sound the alarm 
campbell now 60 was born in newark studied fine art at 
brooklyns pratt institute and joined the army his brother went 
to acting school then to hollywood he was home at christmas one 
time i got a leave campbell says he was doing a picture 
battle cry i said how much does somebody make for writing a 
thing like this he said probably 50000 
campbell followed his brother to hollywood i said id give 
myself two years if i cant break into the business or i find out 
i dont like it ill go to new york and get a job at an ad agency 
as an artist 
things started happening i sold a lot then the town started 
getting to me its a bad town i think cities can bring out the 
best or worst in people i spent my youth in large cities it is 
only since i moved to carmel i discovered i was really a smalltown 
guy at heart 
in hollywood he developed a drinking problem campbell says 
while he didnt mess up any screenplays he wrote hes sure that he 
missed being given assignments he quit drinking 15 years ago 
screenwriting was good preparation for writing mysteries 
campbell says you learn versatility you choose a lot of 
subjects and backgrounds and feel comfortable with them it teaches 
you to establish your characters and set the story rolling in a 
limited space 
now he writes more than one novel at once i will write five 
pages of whatever is the primary book the next one to the 
publisher i may play tennis later in the afternoon or evening if 
i feel so inclined i will turn to the secondary book 
it gives my mind time to relax in a sense instead of 
pounding away at the same problems you pounded at earlier in the 
day you let your subconscious do some of the work for you

editors note james comer learned from personal experience 
that scholastic success depends not just on good teachers but also 
on good relations between families and schools now an expert on 
child development hes putting his theories to work in a program 
to help lowincome minority children 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after more than 40 years three boyhood 
friends still come frequently to mind for dr james p comer an 
expert in the education of disadvantaged children 
comer and his friends were black lowincome kids attending the 
same integrated elementary school in east chicago ind comer now 
53 went on to medical school and national prominence in the child 
development field but one of his friends died of alcoholism a 
second has been in and out of mental institutions and the third 
has spent much of his life in jail 
comer the force behind a yale university program to help 
lowincome minority children do well in school says he and his 
four siblings were successful because they had the firm support of 
their parents and teachers but for his three friends it was a 
different story 
something was wrong in the relationship between them and the 
school their families and the school my friends didnt want 
to see their parents in school says comer a yale professor of 
child psychiatry and associate dean of the yale medical school 
what was clear to me as a result of that experience and other 
experiences was that school integration alone is not the issue 
that quality teaching whatever that is is not the issue it is 
relationships comer says 
that insight was part of the springboard for the yale school 
intervention program directed by comer he says it has shown 
positive results in new haven benton harbor mich and prince 
georges county md and is taking root in lee county ark and 
norfolk va 
one thing dr comers work and research have clearly pointed 
out is that regardless of socioeconomic background and color of 
skin children can do extremely well in school says gerald 
tirozzi connecticuts commissioner of education 
parentschool relationships are a major focus of the school 
intervention program it seeks to overcome the hostility that some 
lowincome parents feel toward school which they may view as part 
of mainstream america from which they have been excluded comer 
explains 
comer tells of a firstgrader who once told his teacher my 
momma said i dont have to do anything you say 
parents and school staff must respect each other and get the 
transfer of authority from home to school that existed almost 
automatically in a pre1945 school comer 53 says 
parents in the yale program are encouraged to volunteer and 
when feasible work for pay in schools as aides they are asked to 
attend and plan school social functions 
other elements include a parentteacherprincipal school 
management committee a mental health team and curriculum and 
staff development 
the mental health team made up of social workers and other 
professionals who may be working already in a school system 
anticipates instead of reacts to problems comer says 
for example an orientation program developed by one team helps 
children transferring to a new school in another innovation the 
same teacher stays with a class through two school years to 
encourage close childteacher relations that in turn foster 
learning 
the school management committee encourages consensus action 
while staff and curricula programs address the schools specific 
needs 
we have parents teachers and administrators working together 
to create a social environment in the school that promoted the 
development of the children essentially we figured out that 
we could systematically teach lowincome children in that 
supportive environment comer says 
the program has run the longest about 20 years in the martin 
luther king jr elementary school in new haven more than 90 
percent of its 260 students are black and many live with single 
working mothers the neighborhood is one of new havens poorest 
before the program started contact between the school and 
parents was limited performance by fourthgraders in reading and 
math achievement tests trailed the national average by 19 months 
and 18 months respectively 
now by fourth grade they are a year above grade level comer 
reports 
attendance is up teacher turnover is almost nonexistent and 
academic rankings for math and language arts had risen by 1984 to 
among the top five of 26 new haven schools 
king teachers anne oconnell and allene small report that their 
interaction with parents is good theres constant communications 
with parents oconnell says 
cindy bogan a parent and school volunteer says she didnt see 
the same level of parental involvement when she was a kid 
they really gear the kids in the right direction she says 
in a followup study several years later former king students 
were found to be doing better in middle schools than other children 
from their neighborhood comer says 
the program is being incorporated into other new haven schools 
an outgrowth has been the testing of a social skills curriculum in 
the citys middle schools emphasizing problemsolving 
decisionmaking and selfcontrol 
comer reports that academic achievement is also up in the prince 
georges county md and benton harbor mich schools the program 
is in its first year in norfolk va and lee county ark and 
cant be measured yet he says 
were at the point now where we know something says comer 
you have to buy it because it makes sense and it works

editors note the name woodstock evokes musical memories 
and not just of the longago 60s to a new generation of 
musicians the upstate new york hamlet is still among the best 
places to make records with all the equipment and none of the 
exhaust fumes of los angeles or new york 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
record producer bob clearmountain is used 
to the skeptical looks he gets when he invites musicians to this 
upstate new york hamlet to make records 
they get this picture in their minds of a gang of hippies 
running around says clearmountain producer or mixer for bruce 
springsteen the pretenders and dozens of other artists 
woodstock may always be synonymous with the festival that bears 
its name the last great party of the flower children before the 
70s set in 
but to a new generation of musicians this town of boutiques and 
endless back roads has a growing reputation as one of the best 
places to make a record outside the music capitals of los angeles 
and new york 
like max yasgurs farm the bearsville studio is not actually in 
woodstock its about two miles west atop a hill reached by a 
winding unmarked dirt road that in winter sometimes takes two or 
three attempts to climb by car 
despite the location suzanne vega found bearsville to record 
her breakthrough hit luka robbie robertson returned to the 
site of big pink to mix his comeback album artists as diverse 
as simple minds cher allen ginsberg and loudness have laid down 
tracks at bearsville in the last year 
the big draw a country ambiance and equipment that makes 
technicians like clearmountain marvel 
its one of my favorite studios clearmountain says its 
very versatile the recording room is very large and its very good 
for recording drums and guitars it has a lot of air and a lot of 
space the other room is one of the best mixing rooms that ive 
ever worked in 
the studio is part of the late albert grossmans miniempire in 
the village of bearsville a hundred miles north of manhattan the 
onetime manager of bob dylan the band and janis joplin bought a 
restaurant homes and offices and built the studio before his death 
two years ago 
the bearsville record label whose bestknown client was fellow 
resident todd rundgren has been inactive since grossmans death 
but the studio once used almost exclusively by bearsville artists 
has seen more action 
we just kind of intensified it says grossmans widow 
sally who now runs the company 
sally grossman may talk eagerly of the greenwich village clubs 
she grew up around in the 60s but her studio has the air of a 
corporate retreat 
freshsmelling wood paneling and blackened windows blend the 
modern and rustic framed pictures of the cover art of albums 
recorded in bearsville during the past year line the walls of 
secondfloor offices 
halfway down the hill is one of a handful of private homes 
grossman has converted into apartments for clients to use while 
recording a second house separated by a catskill mountain stream 
and wooden bridge has been converted into a rehearsal studio 
its in woodstock not in downtown manhattan and if you want 
to get some air you just walk outside clearmountain says you 
dont walk outside and get hit by bus fumes 
a producer with deadlines also doesnt have to worry about 
distractions that cause musicians minds to wander outside of a 
ping pong or pool table and a nearby vegetable stand theres not a 
whole lot to do in woodstock 
and groupies theyd have to be pretty determined 
a lot of the groups prefer working here because of the 
privacy says mary lou arnold a former backup singer to rundgren 
whos acting manager of the studio we maintain very strict 
security i can count on one hand the number of times fans have 
been able to find this place and when they do they quickly go 
away 
of course the isolation can quickly grow old clearmountain 
says artists on extended projects like to split their time between 
bearsville and the city musicians who need to rent equipment also 
have to wait longer for it to arrive 
bearsvilles studio is also the beneficiary of the current trend 
toward spacious rooms the better for bands to set up and run 
through songs live 
the people who built it i dont think they knew what they 
were doing but the way it was built works very well 
clearmountain says most studios are very claustrophobic with 
lots of wires amplifiers and drums lying around that people can 
trip over that studio is so big you can either set up everybody 
tight in a corner or spread everybody out 
bearsvilles growing appeal is more than technical when a hit 
record is produced there it sets in motion musics infamous herd 
mentality 
we get a lot of calls from people who are new who think if 
they just come in here theyll get a hit record arnold says 
a long walk away from the studio the town of woodstock is a 
jumble of small shops and restaurants even on a brisk winters 
day a longhaired middleaged man or two stands idly in a small 
park watching traffic go by 
woodstock already had a long history as an artists colony 
before musicians discovered it in the 60s when dylan moved here 
from new york city it instantly became a magnet for hipsters and 
aspiring hipsters 
it was in woodstock in a house dubbed big pink that the 
band recorded some of its best music including the famed 
basement tapes with dylan at the time dylan was recovering 
from a nearfatal motorcycle accident 
woodstocks singular event the threeday concert that attracted 
450000 people and such artists as joplin the who jimi hendrix 
and sly and the family stone took place in 1969 its actual 
location was several miles away in bethel 
the areas musical history comes alive in cans of tapes that 
fill shelves in a narrow storage room of bearsville studio 
scrawled black magic markers identify the master tapes of work by 
the band rundgren and dozens of others 
its the foreign bands who are usually most interested in 
woodstocks history grossman says shell often give away books 
that describe past events and once gave an impromptu tour to a 
japanese heavymetal band that wanted to see the sights 
i think it means something clearmountain who attended the 
festival says of the woodstock mystique originally people are 
curious about it 
but its the reputation of the studio not the community that 
ultimately keeps musicians coming back he says it reinforces 
how current we are

editors note the community correctional center in downtown 
detroit isnt anyones idea of a country club but to the 
firsttime offenders who live there serving sentences for tax 
evasion mail fraud or embezzlement its a chance to repay social 
debts without losing lucrative whitecollar jobs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the residents of 125 sproat live quiet lives 
faithfully going to work each day spending their evenings playing 
cards or watching television and doing community service once a 
week 
not the usual routine of your average federal inmate but these 
inmates arent in your average federal prison 
they are residents of the community correctional center one of 
two programs in the country the other is in washington dc 
that allows firsttime offenders to keep their jobs while serving 
out sentences of up to one year 
the 50bed prison houses six women and 37 men they live in 
dormitorystyle rooms in the two floors above a salvation army 
most have been convicted of whitecollar crimes such as tax 
evasion mail fraud and bank embezzlement a few have dabbled in 
drugdealing 
once through the program established in 1985 none of the 300 
inmates has been a repeat criminal offender 
a 36yearold detroit man who asked to remain unidentified is in 
the center for securities fraud he would have gone to a closed 
prison if the program did not exist 
a parole hearing at the federal correctional institute in milan 
gave him a taste of what he might have been forced to endure 
you walk in and see the guards in the towers with the guns 
and see the bars on the doors im happy to be in this 
place he said 
the knowledge that a conventional prison could be the next step 
is the idea the program tries to get across 
there are a lot of people whove made mistakes in their lives 
but whose lives arent buried because of it said albert uhl 
us bureau of prisons community corrections administrator in 
detroit 
the court didnt want to put them in confinement but wanted 
some constrictions so the seriousness of the situation would sink 
in he said in most cases they are middleclass people who 
made one bad judgment 
courts carefully screen for inmates they think will benefit from 
the program uhl said anyone who has already served time in 
prison or has a history of assault or a drug problem is 
ineligible he said 
the center is not the country club some associate with 
highprofile whitecollar criminals 
inmates occupy two andthree bedroom units furnished with a 
few basics including a bed a dresser and a night stand it is 
situated in a depressed area of downtown detroit surrounded by 
abandoned buildings and litterstrewn lots 
there probably isnt anyone here who hasnt been approached by 
a drug dealer bum or prostitute one inmate said 
still absent from the typical prison setting are barred cells 
armed guards and violent offenders these inmates are accountants 
securities dealers and pharmacists many find the company 
firstrate 
im having a ball here said leonard a 48yearold 
accountant in the center for tax fraud i shoot pool theres a 
great bunch of guys here its like an army barracks 
though not ecstatic to be there he said he would have gotten 
probation if the program did not exist he is philosophical about 
it and he stays upbeat 
my relations with my family are better he said we dont 
take each other for granted anymore 
helping maintain family ties is another aim of the program 
where visits are allowed three times a week 
one inmate initially decided against having his children a 
3yearold daughter and a 13yearold son see him there he later 
changed his mind thinking it might be beneficial 
i explained the situation to my son he said i wanted him 
to see if you do something wrong youre going to pay for it 
program administrator rosiland humes said nine inmates have 
failed to comply with the rigid rules and were transferred to 
lockup facilities two tried to escape were captured and taken to 
other prisons she said 
there is a commitment on the part of the federal bureau of 
prisons to move in this direction uhl said noting the federal 
prison population is expected to triple to 150000 by the year 2002 
oakland county prosecutor l brooks patterson known for his 
tough lawandorder stance agrees the program can be beneficial 
if a tax evader is persistently and gainfully employed and can 
pay back uncle sam i think were better off for it brooks said 
patterson agrees whitecollar criminals should be treated 
differently from violent offenders 
i dont think anyone in their right mind cant distinguish an 
embezzler from a rapist patterson said a whitecollar 
offender is not going to rape and pillage the community 
the relaxed atmosphere might give the impression inmates have 
considerable freedom they move about the center freely playing 
pool watching television using weighttraining equipment and 
joking with supervisors 
but the sense of confinement is very real 
each inmate has a curfew and is allowed to leave only for work 
inmates are tested regularly for substance and alcohol abuse the 
facility is searched monthly and random pat searches are part of 
the daily routine 
its dehumanizing to have someone telling you to do this and 
do that one inmate said 
a constant fear for some inmates is the thought of being 
transferred to a closed facility 
its a bad feeling to see a person handcuffed and taken out 
said one inmate who saw several residents removed by a federal 
marshal after they failed drug tests 
still many take their stay in stride and maintain a sense of 
humor 
listed on the current activities schedule are roller skating and 
quilting 
i think im a little bit past the rollerskating age said 
one inmate a burly 42yearold detroit man in the center for 
selling cocaine 
but hey i won a candle playing bingo he said 
several inmates think the program would be a good franchise 
investment even if their criminal records would prevent them from 
getting such a contract they point to the requirement that inmates 
pay part of their daily 3750 subsistence based on a sliding 
scale 
however theres no return on this facility which is managed by 
project rehab a nonprofit organization based in grand rapids that 
also runs drug abuse centers and prerelease programs 
establishing the center was the project of us district judge 
john feikens uhl said he said feikens pushed the idea after the 
federal bureau of prisons decided the federal court volume didnt 
warrant building a detention center in detroit

gregory harrison hadnt intended to play in 
his remake of the 1948 screen classic red river until several 
actors turned down the role of the gunfighter 
two weeks before we started shooting we still hadnt cast the 
role of cherry valance says harrison after several actors 
turned it down i said i guess that means i should do the part 
thats how i ended up in it everybody else had been cast for a 
long time 
james arness stars as tom dunson a tough embittered ranch 
owner who organizes a cattle drive at the end of the civil war to 
save his financially troubled empire bruce boxleitner is matthew 
garth his adopted son just back from the war who clashes 
repeatedly with dunson the twohour movie will be telecast sunday 
on cbs 
the story in essence is mutiny on the bounty on a trail 
drive as matthew is finally driven to rebellion against his 
tyrannical adoptive father 
harrison who is coexecutive producer with his partner in 
catalina productions franklin r levy says it was scary 
taking on the remake of the beloved western 
john wayne starred in the original as dunson montgomery clift 
was matt the movie directed by howard hawks also starred walter 
brennan joanne dru and john ireland ray walston plays the brennan 
role laura johnson plays drus role and harrison takes over from 
ireland 
the closest harrisons ever come to playing in a western was the 
role as pioneer levi zendt in the miniseries centennial 
i was able to have a lot of freedom with the role of the 
gunfighter because i wasnt carrying the movie he says i 
could play the bad guy and have fun i think my work is better 
because i did feel free to take chances i loved putting on the 
chaps and the gun belt i learned to rope 
although its a memorable movie harrison points out that it was 
made 40 years ago most people today havent seen it except on 
the late show he says weve added some new characters and 
story lines my partner and i were also very interested in doing a 
western and there arent very many opportunities for that 
there remain many links between old and new the remake was 
filmed in the same area between tucson ariz and the mexican 
border four members of hawks crew worked on the remake as did 
stunt man bud stout who had a small role in the original 
arness was waynes protege and it was wayne who helped him get 
the role as matt dillon on gunsmoke boxleitner and arness had 
played together for a number of years in how the west was won 
the branding iron used by wayne was found and used in the new film 
at the first reading of the script arness read boxleitners 
lines by mistake after 20 years as matt dillon on gunsmoke he 
read the lines for matt by force of habit 
stan shaw stars in a new role as a black broncobuster and 
zachary ansley a newcomer from vancouver canada plays the new 
role of a teenager named cal 
i think we have a stronger story says harrison we dont 
have the limitations they had when they made the first one i like 
the idea of the black cowboy it reflects more of todays thinking 
the only question is that you had such memorable performances in 
the original that nostalgia buffs may not be able to accept the 
remake 
harrison who recently starred with john larroquette in the cbs 
comedy hot paint spent 30 days at the betty ford center to 
break his dependency on drugs and alcohol its a very strong 
program that teaches you to stay away from drugs and alcohol for 
life he says it works for a lot of people it works for me 
hes also producing a stage musical called blame it on the 
movies which features nearly a hundred movie tunes and a 
theatrical comedy called my stepmother is an alien dan aykroyd 
and kim basinger star in the scifi comedy with richard benjamin 
directing 
away from work harrison whose father was the glassbottom boat 
operator on catalina island is pursuing his goal of surfing around 
the world 
so far he has surfed at bali fiji france england denmark 
israel greece morocco south africa australia and in the 
caribbean as well as hawaii and elsewhere in the united states 
harrisons last series was trapper john md in which he 
played gonzo for eight years 
im ready to get back into a halfhour comedy show he says 
one that im producing and have control over an hour show takes 
too much of your time i enjoy being around my wife and child too 
much to do another hour show

michael rupert does double duty delivering 
mail 
the affable boyishlooking actor not only stars in but wrote 
the music for the new broadway musical now playing at the music box 
theater 
the show concerns a distraught man named alex who returns home 
after four months of solitude and discovers a mountain of mail just 
waiting to be opened when he does personal letters bills and 
even junk mail come to life in song and dance 
for rupert the decision to star in a musical he helped write 
was a difficult one to make he needed persuading 
its been exactly what i was scared it was going to be 
exhausting he says now i just dont have any time to myself 
at all but i love it im a bit of a workaholic 
mail began life in the summer of 1984 when rupert and his 
partner jerry colker already were working on 3 guys naked from 
the waist down a musical about the world of standup comics 
at the time 3 guys was between an outoftown tryout in 
north carolina and its offbroadway premiere the duo had some 
moments to spare and kicked around an idea that colker had about a 
man who drops out of life for four months and then comes back to 
face a stack of mail 
colker envisioned the story as a play but what stuck in 
ruperts head was the part of the story about the letter writers 
springing to life on stage 
alex the main character would interact with these people 
he recalls maybe one letter was written four months ago and he 
was here today so you have these two different times and places 
and yet they were interacting i thought how bizarre and 
interesting this would be as a musical 
it wasnt until more than a year later that rupert and colker 
picked up the pieces of mail they worked furiously for three 
months rewriting the show for a reading in los angeles 
then they wrote by longdistance colker was in los angeles and 
rupert was starring on broadway with debbie allen in a revival of 
sweet charity 
it is a little strange to switch gears from writing to 
performing to writing he recalls but it was fun getting back 
into mail for me i was ready for some creative writing 
after sweet charity closed in march 1987 rupert and colker 
began reworking mail refining it on its long road to broadway 
that took the show to the pasadena playhouse in california and then 
to the kennedy center in washington 
writing musical comedy is a logical extension for rupert who at 
36 is a veteran stage performer 
since i was a kid ive been doing musical theater he says 
summing up in one sentence a show business career that begin in 
earnest at age 12 by his teens rupert born in colorado but 
transplanted to california was gueststarring on television shows 
such as gunsmoke and my three sons 
broadway beckoned in 1968 when he starred with robert goulet in 
the musical the happy time he later appeared in new york in 
such shows as pippin and march of the falsettos 
when i wrote 3 guys i had this idea that i wasnt a 
writer rupert says now i had only written music as a hobby i 
thought is anybody going to take this seriously 
the critics did rupert and colker were hailed as a promising 
songwriting team they hope to cement that reputation with 
mail the show however wasnt written with the idea that 
rupert would star in it 
but the producers director andrew cadiff and colker all wanted 
their composer to do it he resisted 
i didnt want to neglect the acting for the composing or vice 
versa rupert says we had had auditions and everything right 
up until a month before rehearsal i kept saying no 
finally they were able to convince him that he was the only 
performer right for the role what won rupert over was the fact 
that he would be supported by an experienced musical department 
heading the team with the title of musical supervisor was 
paul gemignani one of broadways most experienced musicians in 
recent years he has conducted every show by stephen sondheim 
rupert describes gemignanis job as general custodian 
making sure the music works he oversees everything musical 
working with conductor tom fay orchestrator michael gibson and 
sound designer tom morse 
with them i feel confident enough to just get on the stage 
and do my work rupert says the biggest problem is that i am 
on stage the entire show and even when people are singing i will 
be so distracted by what i hear in the monitor ill be going did 
i write that 
its difficult to stay focused i guess i just have to do the 
best i can and play the character and not worry about the score

islamic militants who 
reject any negotiated settlement with israel have played a key role 
in the rebellion against military rule in the west bank and gaza 
strip 
mosques have often become fortresses for fighting israeli 
soldiers and moslem preachers use prayers during friday sabbath 
services to rally support for the intefadeh arabic for 
uprising 
underground leaflets and graffiti on walls are signed by the 
jihad islami the islamic resistance and hamas arabic for 
zeal and the name used by the moslem brotherhood allahu 
akbar god is great has become a common battle cry 
the uncompromising rhetoric of such groups is cited by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir as evidence that the unrest is not a 
political protest but a war aimed at the destruction of israel 
we demand that the jews be put under our rule said sheik 
jamil salim a 29yearold imam or moslem prayer leader in this 
hillside refugee camp near the west bank town of nablus 
we are taught by the koran moslem holy book that jews have 
no good intentions to establish peace they are breakers of 
agreements and covenants 
salim who offers an interviewer a meatandmilk dish called 
shush barak lives with 18 members of his extended family in a 
fourroom stone house on a street so narrow a donkey cart cannot 
pass 
he is critical of arab states and the palestine liberation 
organization on grounds that they are not doing more for the cause 
he contends the revolt is linked to the growth of islam especially 
in the universities 
for 20 years there was no such uprising he said the 
fact there is such an uprising now is because of religious groups 
sitting crosslegged on floor cushions in his diwan or meeting 
room salim said one reason for the growth of islam was the failure 
of other ideologies 
socialism nationalism and materialism all the isms 
failed he said 
salim makes it clear he identifies with the moslem brotherhood 
founded in egypt by school teacher hassan al banna in 1929 he does 
not oppose the diplomatic efforts of plo chairman yasser arafat but 
stresses an arab state on the west bank will not be enough 
we are not against getting part of our rights but we will 
seek all of our rights we refuse negotiations and reject an 
international conference said salim 
outside the walls bear dozens of slogans one signed by the 
islamic resistance which is believed to be connected to the moslem 
brothers declares islam is the solution and the alternative 
speaking in a mosque in the west bank village of mazraat 
sharqiyeh sheik bassam jarrar told several hundred young activists 
that israel tried to justify its actions in the west bank to 
europeans and americans by arguing that it was fighting 
fundamentalists 
some people are trying to say that fundamentalists are behind 
the uprising they want to frighten the west said jarrar a 
moslem preacher 
not all arabs or palestinians hold to the views of salim and 
jarrar nor do the underground moslem brotherhood and other islamic 
fundamentalist groups which along with the plo are outlawed by 
israel have a central spokesman or organ to expound them 
the distrust of israelis expressed by salim is reflected to a 
greater or lesser degree inby hardline prayer leaders in sermons 
and in conversations with other moslem fundamentalists 
the opposition to a negotiated settlement expressed by salim and 
jarrar is widely echoed however moslem brothers support the 
creation of an islamic state that would ultimately encompass all 
states in the region including israel 
in the gaza strip where poverty is pervasive and a majority of 
the 650000 residents are refugees outward signs of islamic 
influence such as traditional long dresses and veils for women are 
more prevalent than in the relatively prosperous west bank 
the arab uprising began dec 8 in the jebaliya refugee camp near 
gaza city 
ahmed hashem ali saftawi 53 who owns a pharmacy in jebaliya 
said the stage for rebellion was set by a group founded in 1986 by 
his 24yearold son imad and a dozen fellow students at the 
islamic university in gaza city 
the group took the name jihad islami or islamic holy war after 
the shadowy proiranian faction in lebanon that carried out suicide 
carbomb attacks on us marines and israeli soldiers under the same 
name saftawi said

<TEXT>
growing to more than 50 active members jihad islami in gaza 
drew inspiration from preachers with close ties with iran but 
saftwai insisted there was no outside direction or funding 
the iran orientation contrasts with the moslem brothers who 
support iraq in the gulf war and as sunni moslems oppose the 
religious dogmas of ayatollah khomeinis shiite moslem regime 
saftawi who joined the moslem brotherhood as a student in cairo 
in the 1950s and later was jailed in israel for plo activism spoke 
with pride about the group 
the youths jailed after carrying out knifings that wounded four 
israeli civilians became local heros when six broke out of the 
central gaza prison on may 18 1987 
for five months they stayed underground until october when 
four were killed in a shootout with israeli forces his son and 
another man escaped abroad a feat previously considered impossible 
by their actions and their success they gave confidence to 
the palestinian people to depend on themselves and be 
selfsufficient said saftawi 
this cando attitude contrasts with the spirit and mood of 
the older generation that had relied on outside help for 
deliverance saftawi said 
we were deceived into believing help would come from outside 
and waited for the arabs or islamic states or the united nations to 
do something 
two days after the interview in his home in gaza city saftawi 
was placed under administrative detention by israeli military 
authorities who can keep him for six months without trial 
the plo in response to fundamentalist revival has tried to 
channel some of the religious zeal into its own movement and has 
formed an alliance with the student groups like jihad islami in 
gaza 
zohair saadat al didi 39 a moslem preacher who served seven 
years in jail for belonging to a guerrilla cell of arafats fatah 
movement argues that a political settlement would stop the growth 
of radical fundamentalist groups 
if the situation improves then there would be no room for 
such groups to continue these groups will become weak and 
ineffective said al didi a freelance journalist in nablus 
known to his friends as abu islam 
this occupation is good for the moslem brothers and other 
radical movements 
al didi said even though his fatah cell attacked and wounded an 
israeli soldier he does not believe in violence against civilians 
i believe there should be coexistence between us and the 
israelis he said there is a possibility of reaching an 
understanding and sharing the land two states a confederation 
cantons it is not important how 
the relative strengths of the plo and islamic groups is 
difficult to assess 
clinton bailey an islamic expert at tel aviv university who is 
carrying out a study said fundamentalists claimed the allegiance 
of at least 30 percent of the 850000 residents of the west bank 
while in gaza it was nearly 80 percent of 650000 
there is a certain gray area because not all people are one or 
the other many who identify with the plo also became religious 
said bailey 
religious zeal he added was one of the factors that brought 
about the uprising 
it gave people more daring and more of a willingness to 
sacrifice it is identified with a certain honesty not tainted 
like the plo by materialism and corruption

the milagro beanfield war 
 
robert redfords second film as a director has been a long time 
coming eight years have passed between his intensely moving 
ordinary people and the new release the milagro beanfield 
war 
once again redford exhibits his basic humanism this time on a 
social rather than personal level and again he displays his 
uncommon talent for working with actors the large cast delivers a 
number of memorable performances 
why then is the milagro beanfield war less than satisfying 
magazine articles about its making have outlined the problems 
multiple script changes wholesale reshooting the tinkering 
appears to have eroded the films basic core it is now a series of 
audiencepleasing turns with little sense of unity 
the war harks back to frank capra the good little people 
against the big bad land barons a new mexico hamlet is being 
squeezed to death by a resort developer richard bradford with the 
help of the state governor and his venal staff the officials even 
send a hatchet man christopher walken to terrorize the natives 
when they grow restive under the rape of their land 
the reluctant leader of the revolt is a small landowner chick 
vennara who inadvertently diverts the land barons water into his 
beanfield he becomes defiant and others strive to make it a 
crusade especially the garage owner sonia braga she enlists a 
disilussioned hippie john heard to print fliers to further the 
campaign 
the land barons goons led by walken try to quell the revolt 
but the people will not give in the sheriff ruben blades who 
seems like a decent man when he isnt doing the land barons 
bidding tries to forestall the imminent violence the ending as 
you can guess is pure capra 
providing grace notes throughout the film are two engaging 
figures the venerable amarante carlos riquelme who wanders 
distractedly accompanied by his adorable pig the ghostly angel 
robert carricart who cavorts at dawn and dusk playing his 
concertina they are marvelous codgers depicting the vigorous 
history of the fading town 
the milagro beanfield war might have proved more effective 
if the townspeople hadnt been so downright lovable and their 
opponents so thoroughly detestable and if the script by david ward 
and john nichols based on nichols book had adhered to a central 
story line instead of wandering over the new mexico landscape a 
mountaintop gunfight in the middle of the movie seems a late 
addition 
redford and moctesuma esparza produced the universal pictures 
release the r rating apparently for language seems overly 
severe running time 117 minutes

off limits 
 
buck mcgriff and albaby perkins are tough cookies how do we 
know because they say spout obscenities at least once in every 
sentence that kind of crude characterization is the hallmark of 
off limits a misfired vietnam war movie that is long on macho 
and short on credibility 
off limits deals with the bleak underside of 1968 saigon 
mcgriff willem dafoe and perkins gregory hines are military 
police investigating a series of prostitute murders their search 
leads them to believe that a high american officer with a taste for 
kinky sex may have been the killer the brass is alarmed and the 
two cops are thwarted in their investigation 
most of the action takes place in saigon bangkok provided the 
locations and it never looked seedier the same for the 
underworld denizens whores pimps cutthroats as well us 
soldiers on their worst behavior the only civilized person is a 
young convent novice amanda pays who counsels prostitutes and 
hence can help provide clues to the killers identity she and 
mcgriff form a friendship that almost becomes something more 
the two detectives quest proves more dangerous as they move 
closer to uncovering the culprit their work seems over when they 
receive orders to ship out but of course they couldnt leave a 
mystery unsolved 
buck mcgriff sounds like a name for a 1950s movie star and 
albaby perkins are what you see except for perkins passion for 
college basketball we know nothing about them their homes 
families backgrounds not that we need a dossier on film 
detectives but it would help to understand why they are so dogged 
in their pursuit 
the fault lies in the shallow convoluted script of christopher 
crowe and jack thibeau as director crowe manages a fair degree of 
suspenseful action but he seems to be allowing the actors to ad 
lib their dialogue and the outpouring of obscenities becomes 
almost ludicrous 
dafoe and hines blend well as the buddy cops but neither 
character is well defined too often dafoe dominates the 
partnership leaving hines with little to do fred ward registers 
strongly as their helpful superior scott glenn makes a brief 
appearance as a crazed colonel whose sudden exit is surreal and 
inexplicable

someone to watch over me rcacolumbia pictures home video 
8995 vhsbeta rated r 
 
someone to watch over me was one of two movies last year in 
which the plot hinged on a cop falling in love with a woman he was 
assigned to watch stakeout a boxoffice smash exploited the 
comic screwball potential of that device in someone the 
romance leads to neartragic complications 
tom berenger plays a new york city police officer newly 
promoted to detective who lives happily in queens with his warm 
nononsense wife lorraine bracco and son the trouble starts when 
he is assigned on the allnight shift to guard mimi rogers a 
manhattan heiress who has witnessed a savage murder and is waiting 
to identify the killer in a lineup 
long nights alone together in miss rogers mammoth and elegant 
east side apartment lead to an affair which jeopardizes berengers 
marriage and career as well as the lives of all the major 
characters 
what lends distinction to this essentially simple melodrama are 
some fine performances especially by berenger and miss bracco 
and the stylish direction of ridley alien scott 
berenger with his sensitive portrayal of a likable character 
betrayed by his own weakness demonstrates again his enormous 
range hard to believe this is the same actor who played the 
earnest but shallow tv star in the big chill and the evil 
sergeant in platoon 
andreas katsulas deserves mention too for his chilling 
portrayal of a particularly sadistic villain

lefty columbia art garfunkel 
 
when art garfunkel released his first solo album in 1973 
ultrahip rolling stone magazine interviewed him and asked him just 
who he thought would purchase an album of sweet love songs like 
jimmy webbs all i know in the waning days of acid rock 
english lit majors he suggested 
it is with the same wit and grace that garfunkel offers 
lefty his seventh solo album a lovely unrelentingly romantic 
record typified by such selections as the evocative i have a 
love a bernsteinsondheim selection from west side story 
garfunkel makes even more use of his unique vocal style on this 
album than he has on previous records from the fingersnapping 
so much in love a remake of the tymes 1963 hit to a 
interesting third worldsounding arrangement of percy sledges 
when a man loves a woman 
background singers pam rose and mary ann kennedy members of the 
nashville group calamity jane are the writers of the beautiful 
love is the only chain which should be a hit on its own leah 
kunkel also sings backup as does stephen bishop who contributes 
three songs kenny rankin is heard on i wonder why 
lefty is a soothing album but by no means homogenized with 
each distinctive cut garfunkel proves his subtle range and 
establishes once again that his taste in music is superb pop music 
rarely shows more class

beethoven symphony no 9 emi the london classical players 
the schutz choir of london roger norrington conducting 
beethoven cello sonatas nonesuch anner bylsma cello 
malcolm bilson fortepiano 
beethoven or bust telarc don dorsey synthesizers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there is a shock in seeing a monument however familiar cleaned 
of accumulated grit and grime its recognizably the same yet a 
constant surprise in its new colors and highlights 
roger norrington has achieved something quite as spectacular 
with his recording of beethovens choral symphony stripped of the 
extra parts added as orchestras grew and shorn of interpretive 
conventions of the late 19th and 20th centuries the symphony 
sounds fresh and new 
norrington returned not just to the original instrumentation 
but to beethovens tempo markings 
some of those tempos at first seem agonizingly slow especially 
in the concluding choral movement but the logic becomes clear the 
chorus is not whipped into a shrieking frenzy as often happens in 
the ode to joy 
this ninth is an outstanding achievement 
beethoven is also brilliantly served by another exercise in 
original instrumentation the first and second cello sonatas 
recorded by cellist anner bylsma and fortepianist malcolm bilson 
by now the question about any such performance is not whether 
the instrumentation is authentic are the strings from a breed of 
cat which beethoven would have recognized but whether the music 
is compelling 
on that score bylsma and bilson are outstanding their 
instruments may speak more quietly than their modern counterparts 
but with no less conviction or fire 
turning to completely unoriginal instruments 
beethoven or bust sounds promising for oh about the first 
10 seconds of the first cut rage over a lost penny then comes 
the first tinkle of a synthesized cymbal followed shortly by an 
elephantine boomchuck boomchuck boomchuck apparently added so 
that the musically ignorant will know when to tap their feet 
this is the sort of sensibility which holds that the parthenon 
by moonlight may be ok but to really enjoy it you need a seltzer 
bottle and a whoopee cushion 
don dorsey who had a charttopper with bachbusters in 1986 
is a skillful technician but on this try a musician of abysmal 
taste skip it

look at that air ann sothern exclaimed 
as she gazed at the smogladen sky outside the window of her 
westside hotel room now you can see why i no longer live here 
for the better part of a halfcentury the blond actress had 
lived in los angeles where she appeared in 56 movies and 178 
television episodes of private secretary and the ann sothern 
show in recent years a resident of sun valley idaho she 
returned to her old home town to bask in newfound glory her 
academy award nomination as supporting actress for the whales of 
august 
how did she hear the news 
i was sound asleep and what woke me was the sound that a 
telephone makes when its off the hook so i hung it up and the 
phone rang immediately it was a friend of mine from here and she 
said i suppose everybody in the world has been calling you i 
said no the phone was off the hook 
she said well you did it you got a nomination thats how 
i learned then of course the phone didnt stop all day 
she had never thought of herself as an oscar contender during 
her long years in the studios until this year at least my type 
of work comedy was not considered very important for awards but 
of course my performance in whales is not comedic 
she was cast as the flighty neighbor of sisters bette davis and 
lillian gish neither of whom was nominated despite early 
predictions 
im an old method actress miss sothern said anyone who 
has studied konstantin stanislavski the russian actor director 
and teacher understands you do preparation for the part what 
intrigued me most was that the name of the character was tisha 
thats my daughters name i thought lord there must be some 
reason for them to have sent me this part 
i liked the role very much and i realized it wasnt too much 
for me she was very capricious very flirtatious i thought the 
red wig i wore was very good for the character i did the part 
about two decibels above my regular speaking voice and i was 
adamant about doing a yankee accent 
about the reports of a feud between legends davis and gish 
lindsay anderson the director is a very strong man and he 
kept things in hand i think he and bette had a few tiffs but i 
had no problems i happen to be a diplomat as well as a tough lady 
and i think bette respected that besides weve known each other 
for a long long time 
i had never even met miss gish and i was in awe to be in the 
presence of this beautiful and talented legend so we got along 
well 
miss sothern shuns mention of age but the record books show 
that she was born jan 22 1909 in valley city nd and began 
her film career in the 1929 sound musical the show of shows 
she is heavier than in her mgm heyday and walks hesitantly the 
result of a long battle with ill health including a broken back 
but her mind remains as lively as ever 
she marks her film beginnings with the 1933 musical lets fall 
in love thats when columbia boss harry cohn changed her name 
from harriet lake to ann sothern reasoning that there were too 
many lakes in movies 
the movie almost killed me she said recalling the years 
when actors could be worked 12 hours a day six days a week i 
decided then that i would never work after 5 oclock because there 
is just so much you have to give and i never did 
the actress moved on to rko and in 1938 to mgm which she still 
remembers with great fondness we were the last of the mgm 
babies myself ava gardner judy garland mickey rooney van 
johnson others i had greta garbos dressing room next to greer 
garsons and joan crawfords we were pampered and we loved it 
at mgm she starred in seven maisie films sang the 
oscarwinning the last time i saw paris in lady be good and 
played the ethel merman role in panama hattie in the early 
1950s she was felled by hepatitis 
i was immobilized for a couple of years she recalled 
when i recovered i realized i had to prove that i was still able 
to work so i went back to the theater and did a play with robert 
cummings for seven months when i came back my agent said 
something new is happening and you ought to get into it 
the something new was television and the two series created 
a whole new audience reruns of the shows are broadcast on 
nickelodeon on cable tv 
six years ago miss sothern moved to sun valley where she had 
skied since the early 1940s 
its a fairyland she rhapsodized beautiful clean air 
were at 5600 feet and its a healthful atmosphere everybody 
skis yes it can also be boring but im thinking of becoming 
involved in a new theater up there 
she was married to two actors roger pryor 193642 and robert 
sterling 194349 
they were not happy marriages and i decided not to marry 
again she sighed i made a mistake but then i always was too 
independent

theres a matisse hanging in a cambridge 
subway station that has nothing to with fauvism impressionism or 
any of the other labels commonly associated with the name 
most matisses appeal to the eye the subway matisse 16 massive 
aluminum chimes and teaktipped hammers suspended between the 
tracks at the kendall square stop pleases the ear with a majestic 
sound that comes when a handle from the platform is pulled 
henri matisse is considered one of the most influential 
20thcentury artists his boldy colored canvases that typify the 
fauvist movement hang in famous galleries worldwide fauvism was a 
french expressionist movement that involved such artists as 
matisse vlaminck and derain and utilized strong bold colors and 
distorted forms 
his grandson paul matisse is less famous he doesnt paint 
but since setting up the chimes of pythagoras last october he 
is cherished by hundreds of commuters who have left their scribbled 
comments on a pad near the handle 
i am getting a proustian rush is this normal reads one a 
less profound comment says simply radical move dude 
others have viewed his functional mobiles at new yorks museum 
of modern art and the metropolitan museum of art the national 
gallery of art in washington the musee dart moderne in paris the 
bienalle in vienna and at other us and foreign galleries 
matisse whose father pierre is a wellknown art dealer in new 
york lives and works in a former baptist church in groton a 
sleepy town about 50 miles northwest of boston with his wife 
artist linda hoffman and their two children 
he talked about himself and his grandfather during a recent 
interview in his workshop a clutter of drill presses lathes 
jigsaws and other tools he wields to create works that titillate 
the imagination through movement sight and sound 
as a boy visiting paris for summer holidays matisse sat 
frequently for his grandfather and has recollections of him as a 
terrifying presence 
when he looked at you to draw you you were looked at he 
said he was like a 50000watt search light 
matisse bears some physical resemblance to his grandfather he 
now does not seem to suffer from the burden of living up to such a 
famous heritage 
it was not always so 
what happens is in a lifetime you go through a whole series of 
responses he said with a chuckle so you go through a negative 
response ive gone beyond that and i feel a very positive 
appreciation of the fact that he was back there 
but he is at pains to emphasize the obvious there is no 
similarity between his works and that of his grandfather who died 
in 1954 
when he drew a line he drew a line he wanted to draw he 
said he knew exactly what he wanted to do and i remember him 
telling me that his hand was his servant and i dont work that way 
at all 
i have to draw while drafting so i do but its not so much 
that its just that i dont have a great love of color and form 
the 55yearold artist said i have a great love of ideas which 
is different entirely and i think im much closer to duchamp in 
respect 
matisses kinship with marcel duchamp the famed french artist 
who began challenging traditional art concepts during the early 
years of this century goes beyond a love for the unusual duchamp 
who died in 1968 was matisses stepfather 
matisse an acknowledged authority on duchamp referred several 
times to one of his stepfathers most controversial works a 
common urinal entitled fountain which shocked the art world of 
his time he hinted at a common bond in describing duchamp as an 
ideas man 
i said duchamp because marcel rebelled against painterly 
art he said commenting on artistic influences he wanted art 
with intelligence 
duchamp said things like bete comme un peintre stupid like 
a painter the influence i treasure from him is his point of 
view 
while mentioning that duchamp frequently expressed support of 
his creations matisse emphasized that he is very much an 
individual personally and artistically 
i am delighted that i was as close to him as i was he said 
but his character was very much his character and in no way does 
mine reflect his 
although expressing reluctance to characterize his own art 
matisse alluded to his creative philosophy in comments on 
pythagoras 
the important part is to do whatever your spirit wants and 
when you hang up a bell or tube you do not get beautiful 
sound he said 
i was able to do all that so why should i be jealous of my 
grandfathers ability to draw lines

rick astley is attracting more attention with 
his first album than he probably expected to have in a lifetime 
it has been 20 years since england sent america anything like 
astley when joe cocker arrived sounding a lot like ray charles 
astleys rca album whenever you need somebody and the 
first rhythm and blues sounding single from it never gonna give 
you up have shot up the bestselling charts in europe and then 
followed the same pattern in the united states where the lp went 
gold 
besides getting a superhit with a first record astley excites 
interest because hes quite a surprise his voice is supersoulful 
deeply resonating maturesounding and hes a 21yearold english 
lad with a diffident air chestnut hair and freckles 
theres so much that gets crammed in astley said during an 
interview at rca headquarters 
private life is one thing i dont get basically any more 
today were a little rushed and that seems to be the norm these 
days i dont see my family any more i dont mean to moan about 
it i knew i was letting myself in for this i realize little 
things in life become suddenly important and you miss them 
its very nice traveling to all these countries all the same 
at the end of the day all the rca offices look the same 
astley was born in newtonlewillows lancashire england not 
far from liverpool like many performers he started as a teenager 
i took up drums around 15 he said i actually liked 
drums with friends a guitarist and bass player we got a band 
together one has gone to college now studying computers one is 
married 
it was a fun thing the bassist was doing most of the writing 
we played anything that had three chords we disbanded out of a 
mutual agreement sort of thing 
then astley at 17 was asked by a band named fbi to be its 
drummer it was in the same little town he said anybody who 
can play an instrument everybody seems to know about them it was 
an allguitar band nobody could afford keyboards 
i started to write most of the material about six months after 
joining he said so i progressed on to be the singer as well 
the bands managers one of whom still manages astley invited 
peter waterman who owns production and publishing companies to a 
performance the band was still very young i was one of the 
oldest and i was 19 astley said he offered me a solo deal 
which i ended up taking fbi continues and astley says theyre 
still friendly 
i went to work for pete for eight months or so i was a tape 
operator in a studio its computerized these days i made tea a 
few weeks until i saw how a studio works then i started recording 
in december 1986 three songs one was never gonna give you up 
the first single i was writing like mad doing demos weekends and 
nights learning whatever i could getting to know everybody 
later astley played guitar on one track of the album no more 
looking for love 
we did that at 2 or 3 in the morning he said nobody was 
around the guy producing said you do it i always play on my 
own demos i said fine i can get by on this 
im not stupid enough not to know there are better musicians 
than me im not going to get into an ego trip when i play time is 
money in a studio id like to do it when i get older 
on never gonna give you up astley said a few notes are 
high it sounds as if it is low im not saying that to be hip 
and cool i prefer to sing lower it feels better and suits better 
i think ive always had this sort of tone to my voice a lot 
of my favorite singers are black guys in britain music by people 
like luther vandross james ingram and michael mcdonald becomes 
part of the top 40 i like a white artists voice with a soulful 
approach 
pwl which waterman runs with mike stock and matt aitken is 
mainly known in the united states as the power behind bananarama 
and samantha fox 
it is almost like a minimotown astley said they 
produce write and arrange for so many people some not big in 
america but massive in england they may have five singles theyve 
written and produced in the top 20 on the british charts in one 
week 
they tend to have a very controlling role everybody says they 
have a sound i wondered what style they were going to use for me 
it was a little more musical than some of the stuff theyd done a 
return almost to the 70s with string arrangements i dont sound 
like most of what they do 
weve recorded aint too proud to beg by the temptations i 
sang it live in a few clubs in london everybody seems to think 
its the strongest thing ive done and thats my direction its 
like rhythm and me singing it seems to show my vocal ability to 
its best i did it slower than the temptations did it my voice 
suits slow i think you can express yourself a little more 
we were going to put it on the first album but didnt want to 
put all the eggs in one basket he said and a lot of people 
lately have released old motown songs ive got all these thoughts 
buzzing around in my head youve got only 10 songs to bring to 
people 
the album includes five songs by stock aitken and waterman 
four by astley and when i fall in love the nat king cole 
hit 
im only 21 astley said as years go on hopefully ill 
get into writing all of an album and producing some of it its 
still early days for me

it is no accident that the cover of john 
updikes new novel consists entirely of an oversize scarlet letter 
s knopf 1795 is a contemporary spin on nathaniel 
hawthornes classic tale of adultery it is also a lighthearted 
sendup of the new age fascination with eastern religions and a 
poignant study of the dynamics of marriage through updikes 
everwise eyes 
s is actually updikes third telling of the scarlet 
letter his 1975 novel a month of sundays was the rev 
dimmesdales version in modern dress his last novel rogers 
version portrayed the cuckolded husband roger chillingsworth 
sarah worth the protagonist of s finally tells us hester 
prynnes side of the story 
updike talked about his 13th novel during a recent visit to new 
york from his beverly mass home wearing a writers gray tweed 
jacket and exuding boyish energy the 56yearold pulitzer prize 
winner sat behind a desk in a vacant office at his publishers 
fidgeting with a paper clip and pondering why he is so captivated 
with the subject of adultery 
it fascinates a lot of novelists somebody once said that 
without adultery you dont have the novel it used to be the 
only way in which a woman became a revolutionary it was a 
highenergy transaction it was the way in which marriage which 
was the basis of the bourgeois social order was betrayed said 
updike 
for men the author noted adultery was part of the social 
order there were mistresses built into the system there were 
brothels built into the system so that in a way the male adulterer 
does not seem to be as conflicted or as passionate or as troubled 
or as vulnerable a creature as the adulteress 
in s sarah a middleaged new england housewife flees her 
inattentive doctor husband after taking amply from their joint 
bank accounts to join a religious commune in arizona that bears 
more than a passing resemblance to the nowdismantled rajneeshpuram 
in oregon her imperial air and seven sisters pedigree quickly gain 
her entrance into the gurus inner circle where she becomes a kind 
of personal secretary and bookkeeper 
there is a way in which sarah is a wicked woman kind of 
selfish and heedless and cavalier shes no saint updike said of 
his protagonist but there is a way in which hester prynne is not 
a saint initially either when we see her as a young woman shes 
kind of sassy really 
asked if the reader is supposed to like sarah this wicked 
woman updike laughed and replied shyly itd be nice if you 
would id be grateful i like her because shes energetic and 
also purposeful shes no slouch tossed out into the world she 
does pretty well in it 
i think what we like in fiction is life and the novelists 
hope is to imbue the characters with life rather than virtue 
dickens had a nice way of getting us really enthusiastic about 
virtuous characters im not sure that in the late 20th century we 
can make people that pure 
updike born in shillington pa educated at harvard 
university and a massachusetts resident for the past three 
decades has published 19 other books collections of poems 
essays and short stories in addition to the novels he is also 
the foreign books reviewer for the new yorker 
the author has mined a prolific career out of his study of 
malefemale relationships he is probably best known for creating 
the ribald harry rabbit angstrom in 1960s rabbit run 
bringing him back a decade later in rabbit redux and again in 
1981s rabbit is rich which won him a pulitzer an american 
book award and a national book critics circle award 
updike has come under fire for his handling of female characters 
in the rabbit trilogy as well as some of his other work in a 
recent new york times interview he said he wrote s to satisfy 
his feminist detractors 
im almost sorry i used that phrase updike said in fact 
women tend to review my books more understandingly and kindly than 
men in the witches of eastwick with three female protagonists 
the women reviewers were much more amused with it than some of the 
men but i suppose i was impressed by the feminist point that 
many women in my books have tended to be dependent and seen to a 
large degree as sex objects so in my clumsy way im trying to make 
female protagonists who are the center of the action 
s is an epistolary novel in which the story is told 
through letters sarah writes to her husband daughter mother 
friends even her dentist and hairdresser the convention usually 
doesnt allow for dialogue but updike cleverly circumvents this 
constraint by having sarah conceal a tape recorder in her clothes 
although the epistolary form has builtin limitations updike 
said its a blessing in a way because it spares you some of the 
carpentry work of the thirdperson novel 
ive always been a realistic writer who treasures getting the 
furniture and clothes right i had to abjure a lot of that detail 
probably good for me sort of a cleansing operation 
even in a breezy satire such as s updikes prose is 
luminescent he is americas premiere stylist writing with a 
precision and lushness that borders on the rococo in his 
descriptions of the arizona terrain or of sarahs beloved new 
england garden 
updike was once called a creator of moral fables he was 
asked if that label fit 
i think of my books as being more moral investigations he 
said i try to raise the question of what is morality and what is 
goodness more than to offer a definition i think any novel to be 
alive must fluctuate somewhat in its moral standpoint maybe 
fluctuate is the wrong word but it should have ambiguity built 
into it it should make the reader think a bit surprise him a bit 
make him investigate his own life rather than present him with 
villains and heros and a good way and a bad way

are we going to see harry angstrom again 
author john updike was recently asked that question while 
plugging his new novel s 
yes i hope if i keep my wits and live a few more years to 
write one more rabbit novel said updike interviewed on his 56th 
birthday and perhaps feeling intimations of mortality i look 
forward to it in fact and its the next novel on my schedule 
harry rabbit angstrom updike fans know is the protagonist 
of the authors rabbit trilogy 
when we first met harry in 1960 in rabbit run he was a 
26yearold magipeel salesman in brewer pa still coasting on his 
glory days as a high school basketball star thats how he got his 
nickname rabbit because he was fast on the court the books sexual 
candor made it a sensation 
in 1971s rabbit redux harry now a typesetter links up 
with a flower child and a black revolutionary in rabbit is 
rich which won the author a pulitzer harry has reunited with 
his wife janice and becomes prosperous almost by accident when he 
takes over his fatherinlaws toyota dealership at the height of 
the 1970s gas crunch 
harry angstrom who has has become as much a part of the 
american literary iconography as holden caufield is updikes ode 
to the american male he is a philanderer and a flirt sometimes 
chauvinistic and a little bit of a jerk yet updike has imbued him 
with a magical quality that elevates him harry is the embodiment 
of grace he has an innocence and an optimism that is enduring we 
forgive him his weaknesses we are charmed by his foibles 
updike said he had not yet started writing the fourth book 
the reason i havent started it im kind of itching to get 
going on it as a matter of fact and i have a few ideas but the 
books have all taken place in the ninth year of the decade 
sometimes the 10th they kind of by accident then on purpose wrap 
up the decade so i have to give it another year to see what the 
countrys going to do he said 
i dont want to overemphasize that side of the books theyre 
not just meant to be headline blotters but on the other hand some 
topical constituent has always been there and in some sense 
harry is a typical american and the headlines go on as a kind of 
background so theres always been a link between him and the life 
of the nation and i have to see what happens what will be the 
postreagan era 
rabbit is the only novel on my horizon and i think itll take 
a while i dont want to rush it id like it to be worthy of the 
series and in a way cap it 
will rabbit practice safe sex did he lose his shirt in the 
stock market crash have yuppies inflated real estate prices in 
brewer well find out in 1990

senate budget writers get their shot this week 
at crafting a 1 trillion fiscal 1989 federal spending plan an 
exercise that normally causes fur to fly but this year should be 
relatively tame 
with 1988 an election year a truce has taken hold in what is 
usually a threeway budget battle among the white house and 
congressional democrats and republicans 
the reason is last falls budget summit pact between congress 
and the administration an accord that settled most of the fiscal 
fights well in advance lawmakers are showing no inclination to 
reopen the usually wrenching decisions about taxes and military and 
domestic spending that the summit has already made 
there are enough hopeless endeavors here without taking on 
another said sen rudy boschwitz rminn a member of the 
senate budget committee 
the budget panel scheduled meetings beginning today to write the 
spending plan for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 committee 
members say they expect their work to be completed as early as 
tuesday or wednesday 
in a rare show of bipartisan unity the house approved a 11 
trillion budget last wednesday there as in the senate the only 
real question left for the lawmakers to decide was how to divide up 
the 1692 billion the summit accord allows for domestic programs 
that congress directly controls 
when president reagan sent his budget proposal to congress last 
month he asked for a 24 billion increase in space and science 
programs the house slashed that figure in half to help finance a 
batch of other programs that reagan sought to eliminate or reduce 
such as subsidized housing mass transit aid and energy 
conservation grants 
the senate budget panel however is likely to be much more kind 
to science in part thats because the committee is chaired by 
democratic sen lawton chiles of florida home of cape canaveral 
and the senior republican is pete v domenici whose home state of 
new mexico houses some large federal laboratories 
theres no doubt youll see science and nasa and futuristic 
things well push that up which means other things have to be 
restrained domenici said friday 
lawmakers and aides of both parties concede that there is little 
support among senators for eliminating programs as the president 
has proposed so to finance those programs and to pay for large 
increases in science education the homeless aids research and 
the fight against drugs the budget panel will have to find savings 
in a wide range of domestic programs 
budget committee members and staffs of both parties have been 
meeting in efforts to sound out differences and forge preliminary 
agreements final decisions on how to spread the pain of spending 
cuts around have yet to be made 
the senate like the house will write a budget using economic 
assumptions prepared by the white houses office of management and 
budget 
the use of those projections generally more optimistic than the 
forecasts of private economists helped the house compose a budget 
with a projected 1989 deficit of 134 billion that would avoid the 
automatic spending cuts that would occur under the grammrudman 
budget balancing law if the deficit should exceed 146 billion 
if lawmakers chose to use projections by their own nonpartisan 
congressional budget office which are far gloomier than those by 
omb they would be staring at an estimated deficit that would grow 
by 35 billion and raise the possibility of enormous spending 
reductions 
some legislators say the administrations figures have as good a 
chance to prove accurate as cbos others say using administration 
numbers will mask the true extent of the red ink but concede that 
there is no stopping congress from using them and postponing real 
deficit reduction until a new president comes to town next year 
it is irresponsible isnt it said sen ernest hollings 
dsc but what can you do im waiting on january

koppers co chairman charles r pullin says 
the entire building materials and cement company may be sold to 
counter a takeover attempt by beazer plc 
pullin said in a written statement sunday that discussions 
concerning a possible sale are being held with certain third 
parties koppers spokesman robert j ogara declined to elaborate 
koppers has rebuffed beazer ever since it appeared on the scene 
about three weeks ago with a 45ashare offer beazer sweetened 
the bid march 19 to 56 a share or 152 billion which koppers 
characterized as inadequate 
before going to shareholders friday with its latest 
60pershare tender offer about 17 billion the british 
construction and buildings materials company tried to negotiate a 
friendly deal at the same price with koppers management 
shearson lehman hutton inc is an equity partner in the beazer 
takeover bid 
pullin said koppers board of directors has instructed 
management to work with the companys financial advisers to 
consider alternatives to a takeover 
those alternatives include a recapitalization that maintains the 
companys independence the acquisition of the firm or a portion of 
its assets by another party and the purchase by koppers of a stake 
in another company pullin said 
a consortium of banks had agreed to lend koppers about 1 
billion to finance a recapitalization which would likely involve a 
onetime cash payout to shareholders 
were progressing in the work that were doing to counter this 
takeover ogara said 
up to now company officials had been firm in their desire to 
remain independent 
beazer spokeswoman lissa perlman declined comment company 
officials have said previously they would sue koppers if the 
company sold some or all of its construction materials and services 
businesses as part of a recapitalization 
beazer sees the acquisition of koppers as a strategic step 
toward establishing a worldwide building materials empire 
separately the us district court in los angeles late friday 
granted koppers an order that prohibits bns from buying koppers 
stock until april 4 at which time koppers will argue for a 
permanent order to block the tender offer 
koppers had asked the court to halt the tender offer for 
antitrust reasons but beazer had agreed to sell koppers aggregate 
plant in los angeles if the deal were consumated to satisfy the 
justice departments antitrust concerns 
beazer believes the temporary order has no practical impact on 
the tender offer since the offer remains open through april 7 and 
no shares can be purchased until that time ms perlman said

the chicago mercantile exchange seeking to 
subdue wild price swings on the nations financial markets has 
adopted an unusual method for limiting daily price moves on its 
standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures 
the exchange said the adjustable limits will take effect today 
replacing the 30point limit the merc adopted for the contract 
after the oct 19 stock market collapse 
the new limits approved thursday by the commodity futures 
trading commission will range from 15 index points to 25 points 
this will depend on the settlement price of the leadmonth sampp 500 
futures contract on the last business day of the preceding month 
investors use stockindex futures to hedge against losses in the 
stock market 
sampp 500 futures account for more than 80 percent of all us 
stockindex futures trades 
merc officials have said the limits will result in better 
coordination of us financial markets a key recommendation of the 
presidential commission that investigated the stock market collapse 
a onepoint move in the sampp 500 index is roughly equivalent to 
an eightpoint move in the dow jones industrial average some 
analysts had criticized the 30point limit on sampp 500 futures 
equivalent to about 240 points on the dow as being too high to 
curtail all but the most violent price swings 
a 15point limit will take effect today because the june 
contract settled february 29 at 26875 points within the lowend 
range of 0 to 275 points 
the limit would increase to 20 points if the june contract 
settled above 275 points on the last trading day of march or to 25 
points if the june contract settled above 325 points

a drug that could save your life may 
be hiding right now in a bit of ordinary seaweed 
so could chemicals that could produce better crops kill 
dangerous pests or clean toxic wastes they just havent been 
discovered yet 
were essentially land creatures thats why weve focused on 
land plants but the sea chemically is a very different 
environment and you will find many new and different things 
there said kenneth terry vice president of ocean genetics inc 
the young company 60 miles south of san francisco wants to be 
the first to find develop and perhaps market some of the 
potentially valuable products that may be lurking in seaweed and 
other forms of marine algae 
in hundreds of glass dishes and flasks in its laboratories or 
huge bubbling tanks in seaside greenhouses ocean genetics is 
growing studying and testing more than 300 species of the simple 
plants 
algae which range from onecelled organisms to large familiar 
seaweeds already are used to make many things including 
stabilizers thickeners and texturizers important in the food and 
cosmetic industries and gels essential to science and medicine 
two of those gels are agar the familiar culture medium in 
petri dishes and its purer electrically neutral form agarose 
which is criticial for many research procedures 
there are no substitutes for either producers are few and 
demand keeps growing that means a profitable opportunity for ocean 
genetics which plans later this year to market agar and agarose 
its now producing and testing 
agar and agarose provide us with the steppingstone i felt was 
necessary for ocean genetics to find and develop other product 
lines said company president and founder wayne harvey 
those yetundiscovered products are the primary though 
longterm goal of the company the company officials said in 
recent interviews 
the highest potential is for pharmaceutical and animal health 
care products but i think the potential of agrichemicals in 
particular natural pesticides and plantgrowth regulators also 
are signficant harvey said 
bay venture group which provided ocean genetics 200000 in 
seed capital when it was formed in 1981 and other financing since 
is pleased with the privatelyheld companys progress and is 
optimistic about the future 
it has all the characteristics of a successful business 
said bvg general partner bill chandler also a director of ocean 
genetics i think the company is going to be a major pioneer 
and of course theres a saying that while pioneers get shot 
in the back they also get to claim the new land 
once it identifies new chemicals ocean genetics will be able to 
grow the algae they come from very quickly harvey said 
thats primarily because the company combines engineering 
knowledge with plant physiology and biochemistry and will avoid 
the vagaries of nature by raising large monoculture crops of 
proven plants in indoor tanks he said 
but the process begins in a santa cruz laboratory filled with 
hundreds of petri dishes and seething carboys filled with large 
pieces of brown red and green algae 
the specimens collected all over the world are cleaned and 
small pieces are put in the petri dishes where they grow for 
several months then they are transferred to the carboy containers 
where for another six to nine months they are kept in purified 
nutrientrich salt water 
some of them are just incredibly beautiful look at the lace 
of the leaf of this plant said harvey displaying a specimen 
whose delicate russet network was revealed by the strong light 
behind its container 
once we have found an organism that produces a product we do 
extensive studies to find out how we can control its 
environment to maximize the production and the quality of what 
were interested in harvey said 
controlling reproduction screening cells for mutations and 
cloning are some of the methods the company can use to increase and 
improve desirable qualities he added 
ocean genetics first research product phychobiliproteins 
already are being produced and tested the naturally flourescent 
chemicals found in certain seaweeds can be used in medicine to tag 
some types of cells someday they may replace radioactive tracers 
now used to study and treat diseases like cancer and aids harvey 
said

jerry mcdowell makes a whole lot of 
cents 
mcdowell heads the plant where most of the nations pennies are 
produced though the us mint finishes the job by stamping shiny 
blanks with their slogans and abraham lincolns profile 
mcdowell knows just about all there is to know about the 
nations 1cent piece hes learned most of it since 1981 when the 
us treasury department gave up penny production and assigned the 
task to ball corps zinc products division in greeneville 
pennies used to be made almost entirely of copper but 
skyrocketing prices for the metal sent the federal government in 
search of cheaper materials and lower operating costs in the 
private sector 
mcdowell and other ball officials convinced the mint they could 
do the job in greeneville and the nations copperplated penny 
over a zinc base was born 
they very quietly introduced this thing and nobody much knew 
there was a change mcdowell said there was one helluva a lot 
of testing before they switched over 
the old pennies were 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc the 
new pennies are 975 percent zinc and 25 percent copper he said 
the mint first wanted to go to allaluminum but aluminum was 
very light and trouble was anticipated with vending machines 
federal officials then thought about an allzinc penny but zinc is 
silvery like other coins and tarnishes quickly mcdowell said 
ball came up with the idea to plate zinc with copper he 
said 
the phasein from old penny to new took a year he said with 
the 42acre plant shipping new pennies in 1982 for the first time 
about 70 percent of the nations pennies are made in 
greeneville or about 85 billion blanks under the governments 
182 million contract with ball for 1988 a much smaller operation 
in la salle ill also makes penny blanks under a small business 
setaside program with the government 
ball corp reported net income in 1987 of 663 million on sales 
of just over 1 billion said tom jenkins an accountant in balls 
muncie ind headquarters that compared with income of 589 
million on a similar sales total in 1986 
the government ships zinc and copper to greeneville and the zinc 
is melted down cast at a rate of 35000 pounds an hour and rolled 
into thin sheets coiled 13000 pounds at a time then pressed into 
penny shapes and rimmed before copper is added during a series of 
electroplate and cleansing rinses 
the process takes about two hours and the longest time spent is 
electroplating mcdowell said each blank penny weighs about 25 
grams and 181 pennies weigh a pound as opposed to 145 pennies a 
pound of the old mostly copper cents 
zinc is less dense than copper mcdowell said 
the pennies are turned from a sleek silver to a shiny copper 
color during their electroplating baths after theyre dried and an 
antitarnish material is added the blanks are checked for quality 
before theyre shipped to mints in 3300pound wooden crates lined 
with plastic 
when theyre new they want them to look new mcdowell said 
a federal law prohibits the government from spending any more on 
making a coin than the face value of the coin which means pennies 
must be made with all costs included for less than a cent each 
when copper prices went as high as 1 a pound in the early 
1970s the government was spending a full cent per penny to 
manufacture the coins itself in the late 1970s copper cost as 
much as 145 per pound ball is now making pennies and theyre 
finished off by the mint at a total cost of sixthtenths of a 
cent mcdowell said 
the mint coins the pennies in philadelphia and denver after 
theyre shipped from greeneville by rail and truck 
ball cranked out about 12 billion penny blanks in 1982 the 
first year of full production because the government feared there 
would be a penny shortage when the word got out copper was no 
longer going to be the primary material 
the government ordered so many pennies that year and in 1983 
because officials were jittery after people took silver coins out 
of circulation in droves around 1965 when the mint stopped using 
silver for dimes quarters and halfdollars 
no similar penny shortage occurred however and the government 
later cut back production in greeneville so the inventory that had 
built up could be depleted mcdowell said penny production has 
been steady since 1987 
the greeneville plant employs about 300 people with the 
facility also manufacturing casings for batteries and other 
zincbased products 
the mint still makes all other coins itself and likely will 
continue to do so mcdowell said 
security is not extraordinary at the ball plant since the 
pennies are shipped as blanks he said besides vending machines 
dont take pennies anyway so criminals arent much interested 
mcdowell said 
how are you gonna peddle them he said theyre blank

united states fell by eight this week to total 935 baker hughes 
inc announced 
in the previous week the count lost three rigs to total 943 a 
year ago the count totaled 748 baker hughes said monday 
the rig count reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs producing oil 
houstonbased baker hughes an oil toolmaker company tallies 
the number of working rigs and the count is the widelywatched 
industry index of drilling activity 
hughes tool co which merged this year with baker international 
corp of orange calif has kept track of the number of working 
rigs since 1940 
the rig count reached a peak of 4500 active rigs in december 
1981 which was the height of the oil boom but oil prices plunged 
to less than 10 per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the 
rig count went with it dropping to 663 the lowest since hughes

the supreme court has agreed to study the 
appeal of a coal company that saw its property tax assessment for 
some 7400 acres of land in webster county wva soar from 
488000 to 123 million in one year 
the justices said monday they will decide whether the increased 
assessment represented systematic and intentional 
discrimination against the allegheny pittsburgh coal co a 
subsidiary of allegheny power system inc 
the west virginia supreme court of appeals upheld the assessment 
by a 32 vote last july 17 
the justices today also granted a separate similar appeal from 
three other coal companies owning land in webster county 
allegheny pittsburgh bought the land in numerous tracts in 
1974 for about 246 million 
the total assessed value assigned to all the tracts of real 
estate was 488000 in 1975 but that assessment was raised in 1976 
to 123 million half the 1974 purchase price 
allegheny pittsburgh challenged the new assessment and repeated 
that challenge for each tax year through 1982 
the company sold the real estate along with the mineral rights 
attached to it in 1982 to east kentucky energy corp for 298 
million 
the proper assessment in 1984 was raised to 149 million to 
reflect 50 percent of the 1982 purchase price 
county officials testified that all recently sold property was 
assessed at 50 percent of its sale price they also testified that 
property not sold during the same sixyear period received 
comparatively modest assessment increases 
a state trial judge ruled that allegheny pittsburghs assessment 
increase violated the state constitution and the equal protection 
guaranteed by the federal constitutions 14th amendment 
but the state supreme court of appeals reversed that ruling 
in a separate appeal granted review today east kentucky energy 
oneida coal co and shamrock coal co challenged the way webster 
county formulates property tax assessments 
their appeal noted that recently sold property is being assessed 
and taxed at a level as much as 6500 percent higher than 
properties stipulated and found to be comparable in every pertinent 
respect 
east kentucky energy is a subsidiary of shell oil co oneida 
coal and shamrock coal are both subsidiaries of sun co inc 
the cases are allegheny pittsburgh vs county commission of 
webster county 871303 and east kentucky energy vs county 
commission 871310

with respect to the american stores offer until the lucky board 
of directors has a chance to further study the bid and make its

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by companies seeking refunds of new jersey taxes they paid 
to help clean up hazardous waste 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that could limit 
the amount of the refunds 
the new jersey supreme court ruled in december that the 
businesses are entitled to only a partial refund if the state 
legislature does not appropriate enough money to reimburse them 
fully 
the case stems from a dispute over new jerseys socalled spill 
fund and whether it was preempted by the federal superfund law 
the us supreme court ruled in 1986 in an earlier review of 
the new jersey case that the superfund preempted at least 
partially state efforts to deal with hazardous waste pollution 
through taxation 
the high court said states only may tax the same companies 
subject to the superfund law for purposes not covered by the 
federal act 
congress then removed the preemption feature from the superfund 
law to eliminate the potential obstacle to state cleanup programs 
at issue in the case acted on today is the size of the refund 
the companies are entitled to recover for the period before the 
preemption feature was eliminated 
the new jersey supreme court interpreted the 1986 us supreme 
court rulig to allow the state to retain part of the taxes the 
companies paid for cleanup costs 
the state court said that if the new jersey legislature failed 
by june to reimburse the spill fund for the full amount of 
preempted expenditures the businesses are entitled only to a 
partial refund 
the spill fund was created in 1977 supported by tax revenues 
that average about 10 million a year 
the 16 billion federal superfund was created in 1980 and 
renewed in 1986 
seeking the refunds are exxon corp bf goodrich union 
carbide monsanto and tenneco 
they said the new jersey court ruling would permit the state 
illegally to retain millions of dollars in tax revenue 
the case is in re exxon corp 871296

there are few disputes more vociferous than 
those on how uncle sam along with his nieces and nephews in 
smaller governmental entities earn their income and spend their 
money 
every taxpayer has an opinion every business too tax reform 
and watchdog groups exist in most municipalities presidential 
candidates cant steer clear of the subject congress tinkers with 
it every year 
academics write books about taxing and spending institutions 
exist for the specific purpose of studying every detail of every 
proposal pressure groups and lobbyists are in a constant uproar 
about their favorite projects 
heres a sampling 
the poor are being nickeled and dimed to death by state sales 
taxes says citizens for tax justice sales taxes are regressive 
says the public interest organizations director robert s 
mcintyre 
as a share of income he states sales and excise taxes take 
five times as much from poor families and three times more out of 
middleincome families as they take from the rich 
taxing the poor heavily is both curel and inefficient he 
says it doesnt produce much in the way of revenues because the 
poor dont make very much money 
progressive taxes based on the ability to pay are the answer 
he says he suggests a salestax rebate plan to mitigate some of 
the regressivity of such taxes which some states impose even on 
food gasoline and utilities 
the center for the study of economics in columbia md pushes 
what it calls incentive taxes as a way to generate revenue while 
simultaneously improving the economic base of a municipality 
its not a new idea having been proposed many years ago by 
economist henry george in fact some municipalities have accepted 
the notion but not enough of them according to the center which 
proselytizes with missionary zeal 
one of its tenets is that the value of land was created by 
society and government nevertheless taxes on undeveloped land are 
almost always far below land on which an investor has placed a 
building 
in short downtown parking lots pay low taxes and contribue 
minimally to the areas economy in terms of jobs payrolls and 
products but lots with structures on them and jobproducing 
businesses in them are taxed more heavily 
they ask if the opposite policy wouldnt be more productive 
shouldnt that parking lot be forced to develop itself into a more 
economically productive role how better to do it than by taxing it 
into compliance 
no discussion of spending and taxing could be so boisterous as 
to drown out j peter grace who headed the presidents private 
sector survey on cost control said by the white house to have 
saved 405 billion in fiscal 1988 
now head of citizens against government waste grace is 
currently circulating his notions of how uncle sam can reduce the 
budget deficit by 60 billion a year 
he claims for instance that 6 billion could be saved in three 
years by establishing a bipartisan commission to recommend an 
extensive program of military base closings 
an additional 1 billion could be saved over three years he 
says by imposing user fees for nonemergency coast guard services 
such as getting a tow if your outboard runs out of fuel 
earlier this month the presidents management report said 
recommendations by the private sector survey led to savings of 
306 billion in fiscal 1986 and 389 billion in fiscal 87 for a 
threeyear total of 110 billion 
they still havent gone far enough said grace in handing 
congress his new proposals 
never at a loss for moneysaving ideas is the heritage 
foundation this year as in years before it is suggesting that 
big savings are possible by privatization turning various 
functions over to the private sector 
this can be accomplished it says by selling off assets such as 
the federal loan portfolio and the naval petroleum reserve by 
contracting out services that it now tries to handle by itself and 
by further deregulation 
if heritage had its way public housing would be privatized a 
private air traffic control system would be developed and amtrak 
the passenger rail service would be sold to private operators

american farmers wont get all the new business if 
japan opens its market to more agricultural imports japanese 
commentators said on the eve of a visit to washington by the 
japanese agriculture minister 
if japan can import freely there is always australian beef 
and fruit from other countries which cost less than us 
products said mitsuru uchida professor of political science at 
tokyos waseda university 
the united states will suffer people will buy from cheaper 
places said hirotatsu fujiwara a political commentator and 
author 
takashi sato the minister of agriculture is scheduled to 
travel to washington on tuesday to seek an easing of us demands 
for an end to japans barriers against beef and orange imports 
the current fouryear agreement on beef and oranges expires 
thursday the united states has refused to open negotiations on a 
new one until tokyo draws up a timetable for a complete end to the 
quotas it also has threatened to take the matter to the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade an international forum that 
oversees the trade rules agreed upon by its member nations 
in separate interviews fujiwara and uchida said japan should 
open its market to imported food but both expressed doubts over 
whether ending japans limits on beef and citrus fruit imports 
would help reduce the united states huge deficit in its trade with 
japan which reached a record 598 billion last year 
japan in recent years has bought almost 20 percent of all us 
farm exports or nearly 6 billion worth in 1986 according to 
japanese government estimates japanese officials say the united 
states ignores the fact that japan is the worlds largest importer 
of farm products 
but over the years beef and oranges have become a symbolic 
issue in what the united states sees as japanese footdragging in 
efforts to solve the trade imbalance 
japans politically influential farm groups say their members 
livelihood would be threatened by an end to the import barriers 
government officials want marketopening steps taken gradually 
although opinion within the government and ruling liberal 
democratic party on how quickly to move still is divided 
talks on monday failed to iron out differences 
us officials say the barriers mean japanese consumers pay two 
to four times what their american counterparts pay for beef and 
citrus fruit 
the quasigovernmental livestock industry promotion corp says 
american squarecut chuck beef had a wholesale price here of 831 
yen a kilogram about 3 a pound last month while a similar cut 
from australia had a wholesale price of 757 yen a kilogram 274 a 
pound retail prices are substantially higher 
australia has made plain that it will seek to ensure that any 
japanus agreements on beef are not made at australias expense 
under the expiring agreement japan raised its annual quota for 
highgrade beef imports from the united states from 31000 tons in 
1983 to 58400 tons in 1987 while raising its quota on orange 
imports by 1100 tons a year 
meanwhile it raised its overall quota for beef imports from 
141000 tons in 1984 to 177000 tons in 1987 
in fiscal 1986 which ended last march japan imported 188000 
tons of beef including 63000 tons from the united states and 
113000 tons from australia of its orange imports 99 percent came 
from the united states

a flood of travel scams has pushed 
two florida legislators to propose a law that would require bonding 
for travel agents a plan that gained the support monday of state 
attorney general bob butterworth 
travel agents would be required to register with the state and 
post bond ranging from 10000 to 25000 unless they already are 
bonded by airline recording corp under the proposed measure 
butterworth endorsed the bill at a news conference at the 
coconut creek government center 
when bogus holidays are offered by deceptive telephone 
promotions the reputation of florida as an ideal vacation destiny 
is damaged he said 
his office launched a major investigation of travel scams last 
june with raids on eight offices complaints naming more than 200 
other travel companies are under investigation 
fraudulent travel providers who fast talk customers in 
telephone promotions are being brought to justice butterworth 
said 
although the bill would add regulation it has picked up 
industry support 
the professional is concerned to make sure the traveling 
public does not get bilked and i think the professional also is 
concerned he doesnt want the reputation of the industry impugned 
by scam operators harold berns a member of the board of 
directors of the american society of travel agents said monday 
the professional travel agent is more than happy to see this 
happen said berns owner of air and sea travel in fort 
lauderdale weve heard too many horror stories not only here 
but all over the country 
tobin and weinstein charged tour operators who take money from 
unsuspecting consumers for trips they will never deliver are a 
growing problem 
a 1985 state law made the fraudulent sale of travel a 
misdemeanor but victims have no way of recovering their money 
without bonding weinstein said 
opposing the bill would be like being against apple pie 
said berns 
most of floridas 2200 legitimate travel agents already meet 
the bills requirements by registering with airline recording 
corp which requires bonds of up to 50000 bond 
virtually all travel agents who sell airline tickets must 
register with the corporation berns said 
agents already associated with such a recording association 
would not be required to register under the bill weinstein said 
but agents already bonded may voluntarily register with the state 
failure to obtaing a bond would be a misdemeanor and the state 
division of consumer services would have the power to shut down 
unbonded agencies

new england fishermen returned to port last year 
with 12 million fewer pounds of fish and shellfish than in 1986 but 
the value of the catch soared 14 percent to 5126 million 
according to figures compiled by a federal agency 
massachusetts led the five states in the region with fishing 
industries both in total harvest and value followed by maine and 
rhode island new hampshire led connecticut in terms of harvest 
weight but connecticuts catch was worth more 
gloucester fishermen caught the most fish and shellfish but the 
value of the catch was substantially below that of new bedford 
fishermen whose lucrative harvest of pricey sea scallops made that 
port first in the nation in terms of catch value for the second 
consecutive year 
the regions 1987 lobster harvest was virtually identical to the 
previous year 198 million pounds compared to 197 million pounds 
in 1986 but the value of that harvest jumped from 462 million to 
546 million 
the preliminary harvest figures were compiled by the northeast 
fisheries center a division of the commerce departments national 
marine fisheries service the center compiles the data for an 
annual report on the fishing industry nationwide that the commerce 
department is expected to release in april 
commercial fishermen throughout the region caught 5437 million 
pounds of fish and shellfish in 1987 down from the 1986 total of 
5557 million pounds but because of increased overall fish prices 
the catch value increased from 4489 million to 5126 million 
massachusetts fisherman harvested 2568 pounds of fish and 
shellfish in 1987 down from 2713 million pounds a year earlier 
but the value of the bay state catch jumped 144 percent from 
2436 million in 1986 to 2789 million last year 
the maine catch of 169 million pounds was up slightly from 1682 
million pounds in 1986 but the value of the harvest increased 22 
percent from 1084 million to 1324 million 
rhode islands catch also remained relatively stable 100 
million pounds in 1987 compared to 1016 million pounds in 1986 
with the value of that states catch increasing 3 percent from 
751 million to 775 million 
new hampshire fishermen caught 93 million pounds of fish and 
shellfish last year up from 79 million pounds in 1986 the value 
of the harvest increased nearly 26 percent from 62 million to 
78 million 
connecticut had the smallest regional harvest in terms of 
weight 86 million pounds but it was worth 16 million an 
increase of 25 percent from 156 million in 1986 when that 
states total catch was 67 million pounds 
in terms of weight gloucester led the regions major fishing 
ports with a catch of 926 million pounds followed by new bedford 
point judith in narragansett ri portland me rockland me 
boston and newport ri 
new bedford fishermen harvested about half of the 182 million 
pounds of sea scallops caught in new england in 1987 according to 
fisheries center spokesman ron l schultz 
the average price of 442 a pound paid to fishermen for sea 
scallops was by far the highest of the 14 major species of fish and 
shellfish harvested in new england waters the average price paid 
to fishermen for lobster was 291 a pound 
the price paid to gloucester fishermen falls far below that paid 
to their new bedford counterparts because two of the major species 
harvested by gloucester fishermen pollock and atlantic herring 
net perpound prices among the lowest of the 14 species

irving bank corp which is resisting a 108 
billion takeover offer from another banking company said monday it 
took additional steps to discourage hostile bidders from acquiring 
its stock 
irving said its board of directors approved an amendment to its 
share purchase rights plan that would deal with the possibility of 
a street sweep under which a bidder who terminates a tender 
offer then begins buying the target companys begins on the open 
market or in privately negotiated deals 
irving said the provision was adopted to assure that a street 
sweep would not jeopardize irvings efforts to explore alternatives 
that would maximize values for its shareholders 
bank of new york co launched a 60ashare offer of cash and 
securities last week for each of irvings 181 million common 
shares outstanding 
irving has called the offer inadequate and indicated last week 
that it was seeking a friendly bidder and exploring other 
alternatives to thwart the hostile offer 
the scrap has attracted an unusual level of attention because 
hostile takeover efforts are rare in the banking business 
a spokesman for bank of new york owen brady said his company 
thought the latest provision adopted by the irving board was 
illegal and said it was investigating what to do about it 
separately bank of new york disclosed that its chairman j 
carter bacot asked joseph rice irvings chairman in a letter to 
make sure that bank of new york gets a chance to look at any of the 
confidential financial information that irving has been sharing 
with other potential friendly bidders 
under the new move by irving the companys previously adopted 
share purchase rights plan would be activated if a party who made a 
tender or exchange offer subsequently bought enough nontendered 
irving stock to push its total irving stake to 5 percent or more 
if that occurred each right would entitle its holder to 
purchase irving stock with a market value double the rights 
exercise price 
bank of new yorks tender offer currently is scheduled to expire 
april 15

us sen john heinz monday said he will 
introduce legislation to thwart a hostile takeover of koppers co 
by british business magnate brian beazer and the wall street 
investment bank shearson lehman hutton inc 
the pennsylvania republican charged again at a news conference 
that if a 17 billion tender offer from bns inc succeeded beazer 
will gain a monopoly in the various local markets for aggregates 
road building materials that include the sand and pebbles added to 
concrete to make cement 
one of the reasons its attractive to have a stranglehold on 
the existing aggregates business is that environmental laws are 
such at the state and local level that you cannot easily open a 
new source of aggregate he said so in effect it is a sellers 
market for a very very long time 
us sen arlen specter rpa said monday he asked attorney 
general edwin meese to personally review the koppers case and to 
respond to the request by thursday 
heinz withheld details of the proposed legislation 
to reveal our stragegy might very well be to jeopardize its 
success he said 
the proposal will be offered this week or after the easter break 
in congress as an amendment to pending legislation heinz said the 
proposed law is unlike an amendment sponsored by us rep john 
bryant dtexas to require foreign investors to disclose details 
of takeover attempts 
im not in the business of making hollow promises and i do 
not make idle threats heinz said i have drafted and am 
prepared to introduce and press legislation to make the takeover of 
koppers extremely unpalatable to beazershearson and similar 
consortiums in the future 
the corporate raiders will be and should be as surprised by 
this legislation as koppers was by this raid 
we are not corporate raiders beazer declared in a fullpage 
advertisement monday in pittsburghs newspapers our goal is not 
to make a quick buck rather we are in the process of creating a 
vital dynamic worldwide organization 
beazers ad appealed to koppers worried employees and to the 
city to investigate the fate of the atlanta homebuilder cohn 
communities and the dallas construction materials company 
giffordhill after he acquired them in 1985 and 1986 respectively 
each of those companies has grown and prospered under our 
ownership he said 
koppers has rejected each of the offers 45 56 and 60 per 
share that bns has made since launching its cash tender offer 
march 3 the latest expires april 7 although a federal court in 
california has blocked the acquisition over antitrust concerns 
koppers management says it may sell all or part of the company 
or pay cash to shareholders to keep the company out of beazers 
hands 
heinz said taxpayers would spend more for public roads if the 
takeover succeeds the combination would heighten beazers 
concentration in markets where his holdings and koppers compete 
the two of them combined in what are essentially local market 
areas would if the sale went through amount to a de facto local 
monopoly on very costly road building materials he said 
the senator allegheny county commission chairman thomas 
foerster and others at the news conference warned that the takeover 
jeopardizes the approximately 1100 pittsburgharea jobs in 
koppers chemicals businesses 
beazer has said he would sell chemicals and related businesses 
although it is not clear that all those jobs would be eliminated 
opponents also worry about the 232 million that koppers 
contributes to the area economy 
heinz joined city county and state officials who have lambasted 
shearson for going a step beyond traditional takeover financing and 
becoming an equity partner in the takeover company bns 
i am appalled by the involvement of shearson he said 
shearson stands to gain tens of millions of dollars in fees 
simply for shuffling some paper around 
shearson officials have said their ownership in bns is merely a 
temporary method of helping finance the takeover

the federal fund that insures deposits in 
commercial banks could suffer a loss in 1988 for the first time in 
its 54year history federal deposit insurance corp chairman l 
william seidman said monday 
seidman said a loss to the insurance fund if any would depend 
on how much the fdic spends to resolve the problems of first 
republicbank of dallas which earlier this month received a 1 
billion infusion of government aid 
the deterioration of texas banks hard hit by losses on real 
estate and energy loans has raised concern about the health of the 
insurance fund which backs deposits of up to 100000 in 13700 
commercial banks 
speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters seidman said it 
is too soon to say with certainty what the cost of restoring first 
republicbank to health will be but he said the 5 billion to 6 
billion estimates of some are far higher than anything that is 
likely to be required 
he said the 17 billion cost of the 1984 bailout of continental 
illinois bank amp trust co which was about the same size as first 
republicbank is the best guide we have 
the fdics initial outlay on first republicbank could be higher 
than the ultimate cost just as it was in the case of continental 
when the agency spent 45 billion seidman said 
however he said the fdic now usually tries to structure bank 
rescues so that the initial cash cost is close to the ultimate cost 
if the first republicbank cost is in the 17 billion range and 
if banks fail this year at about the same rate as last year then 
it is possible we will have a loss in 1988 he said 
last year a postdepression record of 184 banks failed 
fortyfour have failed so far this year and seidman said he 
expected the 1988 total to be roughly the same as 1987 
as failures have increased the steady growth of the fdic fund 
from 46 billion in 1970 116 billion in 1980 to 179 billion 
in 1985 has slowed the fund finished 1986 with 182 billion and 
1987 with 183 billion 
seidman said the 1988 loss if it occurs would be something 
under 5 percent certainly under 1 billion he said he 
did not see any prospect for what he termed a substantial loss one 
approaching 20 percent or about 35 billion 
he contrasted the relatively healthy condition of the fdic fund 
with that of the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
insures deposits in 3170 savings institutions fslic was insolvent 
until last fall when money began flowing from 
congressionallyauthorized bond sales it has had to keep bankrupt 
sampls open because it lacked the money to pay off depositors

the dollar plunged again monday piercing key 
levels as central bank intervention failed to pull it out of the 
doldrums 
gold prices rose republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid price for gold of 45510 a troy ounce as of 4 pm est up 
from fridays late bid of 45275 an ounce 
in a wave that swept westward the dollar fell in tokyo before 
closing lower in very light european trading in new york the 
dollar dipped below the 124yen barrier to finish at its lowest 
point since early january in active trading 
dealers said the federal reserve entered the market to buy 
dollars but the move only served to smooth out the currencys 
latest decline which began last week 
the fed was not very useful in what youd call turning the 
dollar around said ron sapiro head trader at continental 
illinois national bank amp trust co in chicago 
but because the dollars decline was essentially orderly 
there was no reason for the fed to come in en masse he added 
traders in europe were surprised that central banks did not 
aggressively step in to support the dollar its gotten away with 
the decline because its been so gradual said a london trader 
who speculated that the central banks would have intervened to 
stave off a hastier retreat 
traders said the dollars slide was fueled more by investors 
attraction to other major currencies than by any worries about us 
economic factors everybodys in love with the yen rather than 
spurning the dollar sapiro said 
but the yen is not the only currency on the rise all the 
highyielding major currencies are benefitting from the 
markets recent strength said james mcgroarty a vice president at 
discount corp 
instead of simply selling dollars traders are jockeying their 
deals among several currencies there has been a lot of 
crossplaying sapiro said albeit at the dollars expense 
with most currency markets scheduled to close friday for the 
easter holiday traders may already be beginning to square off 
their positions analysts said 
in tokyo where the business day ends as europes begins the

soybeangrowing region of rio grande du sul had prompted the

but traders were divided over the extent of damage to the nearly 
ripe brazilian crop especially after light weekend rains were 
reported in the rio grande du sul area

prices on a combination of fundamental and technical factors with 
most players feeling bullish ahead of thursdays agriculture

nearly unchanged in quiet trading

the sidelines

they reflected a bearish sentiment that continued to pervade the 
market and the anxiety was deepened by fresh declines in the

defecting lord geller executives to work out a plan for introducing 
evidence in the case

they felt unduly constrained under the ownership of the british 
firm wpp group plc 
wpp group which is headed by martin sorrell had aquired lord 
geller last summer when he bought its parent jwt group inc for 
566 million in the biggest ad agency acquisition ever in addition

four companies seeking to build a 
stateoftheart transportation system in floridas congested 
corridors conjured images monday of a bullet train that would whisk 
passengers at speeds of 150250 mph along a tampamiami route 
company representatives envisioned sleek hightechnology trains 
that resembled airplanes in appearance planned suburbs and cities 
springing up along the routes and quiet and comfortable trips 
between tampa and miami that took only 90 minutes regardless of 
the weather 
state officials attending the presentations were urged to think 
about the tourism boom the business opportunities and 
environmental advantage of having a clean and efficient way of 
moving as many as 6 million people along routes between miami 
orlando and tampa every year 
legislative leaders seemed to like what they were hearing 
florida was the first state to have a settlement in the new 
world it was the site of the first moon launch and now it will be 
the site of the first truly modern rail system in the world said 
house speaker jon mills i think its symbolic of what florida 
can become 
mills dgainesville attended the crowded presentation ceremony 
in floridas old capitol along with gov bob martinez senate 
president john vogt dmerritt island and officials of the rail 
commission 
the florida high speed rail transportation commission was not 
expected to award a franchise until september 1991 to allow time to 
study the project and its costs which could run as high as 5 
billion the train linking tampa orlando and miami is expected to 
be running by 1995 
state guidelines mandate that the project must link the three 
cities but the applicants will determine precise routes financing 
agreements and the technology they will use 
the company that wins the franchise will be allowed to develop 
property adjacent to the route for rail stations and connecting 
attractions the idea is that those developmental rights will help 
the company recoup the startup costs of building the rail system 
one of the four applicants was tgv of florida inc backed by 
the french company alsthom which supplies tgv trains to the french 
national railways and bombardier inc a canadian manufacturing 
consortium 
tgvs proposal for an electrified system would include trains 
that could run up to 185 mph and the cost several billion dollars 
tgvs big advantage is that the system in france has been very 
successful 
all american magneplane inc argued that its technology was 
newer faster and cleaner environmentally the magneticlevitation 
trains called maglev for short would glide along a magnetic 
field along an elevated track because a magnetic force controls 
the movement of the train instead of electricity or dieselpowered 
engines company officials said their system eliminates the 
dependence on oil 
that system also is expensive in the neighborhood of 3 billion 
two other companies the florida high speed rail corp and stone 
and webster engineering corp have proposed plans for systems that 
run a little slower in the neighborhood of 150 mph and cost less 
because they use existing transportation corridors 
stone and webster have submitted the lowest general estimate of 
cost recommending that the system could be built for about 1 
billion 
after judging the proposals on the basis of environmental 
effects financial arrangements growth patterns and technologies 
the rail commiission can recommend one or none of the applicants 
to the governor and cabinet

american stores co said monday it was 
prepared to up its bid for lucky stores inc to more than 19 
billion in an effort to create the nations largest grocery store 
chain 
in a letter to the board of the dublin califbased company 
american stores chairman ls skaggs said his company was ready to 
offer 50 per share if a mutually acceptable agreement could be 
worked out with lucky stores 
earlier monday american launched a cash tender offer for lucky 
at 45 per share or a total of 174 billion that offer expires 
at midnight april 22 
we made clear our willingness to negotiate concerning all 
aspects of our offer including the price said skaggs in his 
letter to lucky 
skaggs noted that lucky stores representatives had so far 
declined the invitation to negotiate 
the combination of american the nations third largest grocery 
retailer with 1700 stores and annual sales of 15 billion and 
lucky the sixth largest with 480 stores and sales of 7 billion 
could produce the biggest grocery retailer in the country analysts 
say 
lucky stores officials were not immediately available for 
comment on the latest developments which were announced by press 
release after the close of stock trading 
lucky shares advanced 87 cents to close at 4862 while 
american shares lost 175 to finish at 5487 on the new york 
stock exchange 
before american revealed the contents of its letter to the lucky 
stores board lucky spokeswoman lissa perlman said company 
officials had been reviewing the offer with financial and legal 
advisers since last week 
lucky strongly advises its stockholders not to take any action 
with respect to the american stores offer until the lucky board 
of directors has a chance to further study the bid and make its 
recommendation perlman said 
no deadline for a recommendation was given 
in a march 21 letter skaggs notified lucky stores chairman john 
m lillie of the then impending tender offer skaggs said if the 
offer was successful he planned to combine american stores alpha 
beta stores with luckys operation under the lucky name 
the letter praised luckys management and marketing strategies 
and invited lucky executives to stay on if the deal is completed 
luckys headquarters would remain in dublin skaggs said 
the bid for lucky came 16 months after takeover specialist asher 
edelman dropped his hostile effort to acquire the company in 
return lucky agreed to pay his 28 million in legal bills 
lucky kept edelman at bay partially by selling off its 
nongrocery divisions and adopting antitakeover measures 
after the text of the letter was released last week lucky 
officials had no comment on the american stores tender offer 
except to say company bylaws contain a poison pill 
antitakeover provision limiting the voting power of any 
shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of luckys stock 
american stores last made financial headlines in 1984 when it 
spent 11 billion to take over jewel companies inc a 
chicagobased grocery drug and convenience store chain 
that acquisition expanded american stores operations from just 
over 1000 retail outlets to its present 1700 the company has 
three divisions skaggs which operates supermarkets in the 
western united states american superstores which runs outlets in 
the midwest and east and osco drug stores which has stores

a proxy solicitation by batus inc which is 
making a hostile bid for insurer farmers group inc may be illegal 
and may have to be halted the kansas insurance department has said 
the ruling was disclosed monday by los angelesbased farmers 
which has been resisting takeover overtures by batus since january 
it was later confirmed by batus the american subsidiary of 
londonbased bat industries inc plc 
at issue is whether a proposal by batus for which proxies are 
being sought would if successful constitute a change in control 
of the company 
the proposal seeks to make farmers directors reconsider their 
previous refusal to negotiate on batus takeover offer of 63 per 
share or 45 billion 
meanwhile farmers filed suit monday in nevada where the 
company is incorporated challenging batuss proxy solicitation 
farmers claims batus did not disclose enough information in the 
solicitation an april 13 hearing on the dispute was scheduled in 
us district court in reno 
judge howard mckibben also said he would decide by wednesday 
whether to declare unconstitutional the nevada takeover act which 
prevents stockholders from taking advantage of tender offers after 
the deal is 60 days old 
the nevada attorney generals office contends the law is meant 
to protect investors from being strung along for months during a 
takeover bid 
but batus attorneys argue the nevada law conflicts with the 
federal williams act which gives shareholders the right to 
participate in tender offers at will 
the kansas insurance company holding act says no one can take 
control of an insurer without first obtaining regulatory approval 
control shall be presumed to exist if any person holds 
proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities 
the law says 
if the issue isnt resolved or the proxy solicitation isnt 
stopped immediately the regulators said the department will 
be required to initiate the applicable administrative or legal 
action 
the kansas insurance department outlined its concerns in a 
letter to batus dated last thursday 
batus said monday that it is responding and strongly believes 
that it will be able to satisfy the concerns raised 
batus is basing its argument on the contention that its 
proposal even if successful couldnt directly constitute a change 
in control of farmers 
in fact a change in control cannot result from a vote on our 
proxy batus spokesman wilson wyatt said 
kansas is one of nine states in which farmers owns insurers 
regulatory approval must be obtained in each of those 
besides kansas where farmers group operates farmers insurance 
co and california where farmers group is based the other states
