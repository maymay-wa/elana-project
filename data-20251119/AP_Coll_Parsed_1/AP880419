abc news is developing a new primetime news 
program that could show up on the networks schedule next fall 
says abc entertainment president brandon stoddard 
theyre developing a couple of shows and i think theres a 
possibility abc news would have another hour prime time come fall 
i just dont know what time period or when or what the show would 
be but there is active development in that area stoddard told a 
news conference on monday 
the abc programmer stirred controversy last year when he 
announced he was moving abcs 2020 newsmagazine out of its 
successful thursday night time period the news division feared the 
shows ratings would decline but much of its audience apparently 
followed it to friday and it finished the season in the midrange 
of the ac nielsen co rankings 
if there is a new news show it might be the only new show ready 
to start in the fall stoddard said he wasnt optimistic of an 
early end to the 6weekold writers guild of america strike 
he suggested if it lasts into june it could substantially delay 
the start of the 198889 television season causing more defections 
by network viewers to alternatives like cable and videocassettes 
according to nielsen figures the three networks lost 9 percent 
of their audience between last season and this season though the 
networks blame part of the reduction on a change in nielsens 
audience measurement system 
stoddard said a delay in the start of the new season would force 
networks the keep running repeats 
in addition to that when the strike is finished and we start 
putting programs on the air theres going to be tremendous 
pressure to get something up on that screen and maybe it aint 
perfect when we do he said 
i think there also could be some erosion caused by the lack of 
quality this is a very serious problem 
of this seasons new shows stoddard said he was most 
disappointed in dolly and that the network was considering 
buying out star dolly parton and canning the show next year parton 
got a twoyear guarantee last year 
as you all know we actually have the right not to do the 
show stoddard said there is a penalty payment we would pay if 
we did not go ahead on the second year he would not say how much 
it is 
stoddard also listed moonlighting as a disappointment 
formerly a top10 show moonlighting dropped into the top 20 
this season due to frequent repeats and episodes without cybill 
shepherd during her pregnancy nevertheless stoddard said the 
show most likely will be back next season 
other likely returnees are the wonder years and 
thirtysomething stoddard said he was optimistic that 
hooperman would be renewed and that executive producer steven 
bochco had even developed a spinoff the slap maxwell story 
is going to be a tough call stoddard said 
while happy his network was second this season in the nielsen 
ratings with an average primetime rating of 137 to cbs 135 
stoddard said the performance really was not that terrific nbc 
had a 161 
without highrated primetime sports programming the world 
series the super bowl and the winter olympics abc actually was 
third in the ratings 
the rating is a percentage of the nations 886 million homes 
with televisions

new york gave democratic leaders what they 
wanted a frontrunner but the history of their rollercoaster 
process made many reluctant to declare that michael dukakis had the 
nominaton locked up 
we no longer have the winneraweek syndrome james ruvolo 
chairman of the ohio democratic party said tuesday but he quickly 
added i dont think you can say its over 
one of the few party leaders willing to describe dukakis as the 
nominee was lynn cutler deputy chair of the democratic national 
committee 
i think we have a nominee said cutler but she warned that 
the dukakis campaign must be very careful not to look as though 
its a done deal 
peter d kelly chairman of the california democratic party 
said many of the elected and party officials designated as super 
delegates to the nominating convention may be reluctant to jump 
too quickly onto the dukakis bandwagon 
theyre going to want to be real careful about angering jesse 
jackson and his supporters said kelly i for one am very 
sensitive about offending that constituency 
dukakis big victory in new york essentially knocked sen albert 
gore jr out of the race finally paring the democratic field down 
to a twoman contest dukakis versus jackson 
the massachusetts governor was assured of a big delegate harvest 
in pennsylvania next tuesday after jackson filled only about 65 
percent of the 178 delegate slots at stake 
but caution stemmed in part from the fact that for months every 
time a candidate was on verge of claiming frontrunner status the 
voters knocked him down a peg 
an even stronger factor was the formidable presence of jackson 
and the need now to seriously confront the oftenasked question 
what does jesse want 
on the campaign trail jackson relishes ridiculing that 
question responding with a recitation of the basic liberal 
democratic agenda a higher minimum wage health care housing a 
shifting of priorities away from those of the reagan administration 
repeatedly jackson has also said he wanted to enable our 
party to win and was determined to play a role in making that 
happen 
when a questioner at a new york breakfast asked jackson what he 
would do if he didnt get the nomination the candidate replied 
that it was important to put the nation first and party second 
and your role third 
among the established leaders of the party there was concern 
about what jacksons large constituency so essential to democratic 
victories in general elections would do if he failed to get the 
nomination 
ruvolo said it was important for dukakis to continue campaigning 
hard in pennsylvania ohio and other upcoming primary states to 
avoid being embarrassed but also because the contest has to be 
perceived as a fair fight by jacksons supporters 
said cutler i think we have to be very careful in these next 
weeks that rev jacksons candidacy continues to be treated with 
respect wellearned credit for everything that hes done for the 
party

three top justice department aides to deputy 
attorney general arnold burns are quitting or transferring to new 
jobs marking a new round of departures and creating additional 
problems for attorney general edwin meese iii 
all three deputies rejected overtures by aides to meese to 
remain at the justice department after the abrupt march 29 
resignations of burns and criminal division chief william weld 
department sources said tuesday 
meanwhile meese said he expects to hear shortly from st louis 
attorney john shepherd on whether the former american bar 
association president plans to withdraw from consideration as 
burns successor 
probably tomorrow justice department spokesman terry 
eastland said tuesday evening when asked whether there was any word 
on shepherds status 
shepherd 62 told meese last friday that he was giving serious 
consideration to withdrawing because of stress on his family 
stemming from his selection 
a former bookkeeper from shepherds law firm testified shortly 
before meese recommended him for the post that she had an affair 
with shepherd the bookkeeper who was convicted of embezzlement 
claimed shepherd had told her to write checks to herself shepherd 
denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her 
to write checks 
the washington post reported in wednesdays editions meanwhile 
that shepherd was recommended for a justice department position in 
late 1984 or early 1985 by e robert wallach a longtime meese 
associate now under indictment in connection with the wedtech 
scandal in new york the post quoting justice department sources 
said shepherds ties to wallach came up in the fbis background 
checks of shepherd and caused some concern 
the post also reported that shepherd agreed not to withdraw from 
consideration until thursday to give meese time to find a 
replacement 
two other deputies to burns randy levine and boykin rose also 
handed in their resignations march 29 the latest exit of personnel 
would virtually empty the no 2 office in the justice department of 
top aides 
it is customary for the deputy attorney general to pick his own 
assistants but the sources said meeses staff has sought to keep 
top deputies posts filled following the resignations of burns and 
weld and the vacancy in the departments no 3 position due to the 
departure of associate attorney general stephen trott who is now a 
federal judge 
burns resigned with weld out of concern that meeses continuing 
legal troubles stemming from a nearly yearlong criminal 
investigation were damaging the justice departments operations 
morale and image 
the department sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the latest departures included raymond b ludwiszewski paul 
cassell and gregory walden 
ludwiszewski an associate deputy attorney general who came to 
the justice department in 1985 has handed in his resignation and 
is negotiating with private washington law firms for work the 
sources said 
ludwiszewski who was graduated magna cum laude from harvard law 
school in 1984 and was on the harvard law review specialized in 
legal issues pertaining to the lands and civil rights divisions and 
the solicitor generals office 
cassell a burns deputy who dealt with issues involving the 
departments criminal and antitrust divisions is transferring to 
the us attorneys office in alexandria va where he will become 
an assistant us attorney cassell was president of the stanford 
law review 
in a move that has been in the planning stages for some time 
walden an associate deputy attorney general is to become chief 
counsel to the federal aviation administration he will leave the 
justice department in a few weeks walden who has been with the 
department since 1983 has helped spearhead the governments 
various criminal investigations of former philippines president 
ferdinand marcos 
burns last day at the department is friday

the number of fullblown aids cases in the 
world is likely to increase fivefold in the next three years and 
hundreds of millions of people probably engage in activity that 
leaves them vulnerable says the head of the world health 
organizations aids program 
while it has become fashionable to reassure and state that 
aids will never threaten large populations we believe that 
virology immunology sociology and epidemiology require us to take 
the long view and a more somber view dr jonathan mann told the 
white house aids commission monday 
let us remember that we are still in the early phases of a 
global epidemic whose first decade gives us every rational reason 
for concern about the global future of aids he said hiv the 
aids virus does not need to spread rapidly in a population to have 
a tremendous and gradually expanding cumulative effect 
mann said that while no precise figures are available it is 
likely that several hundred million people around the world may 
have behaviors which make them potentially vulnerable to infection 
with hiv 
while he did not spell out such behavior at that point in his 
testimony it was clear he was referring primarily to unprotected 
sex with potentially infected partners and secondarily to drug 
users sharing needles with people who may be carrying the virus 
individual behavior is responsible for most hiv 
transmission he said this transmission requires the active 
participation of two persons therefore the chain of transmission 
can be broken by the individual behavior of either the infected or 
the noninfected person for this reason the proper focus of 
prevention is behavior 
he said education is essential to combating the epidemic 
if intravenous drug users do not understand the words you use 
to describe needles syringes and other drug equipment they cannot 
learn prevention if adolescents are convinced that aids is being 
used to deprive them of sexual freedom they may refuse to listen 
to prevention messages and even counterreact in ways that further 
endanger their lives mann said 
more than 81000 aids cases were reported to the organization as 
of the end of february but the actual number of aids cases is 
believed to be twice the reported total 
who estimates that between 5 million and 10 million people are 
infected with the virus and that 150000 new cases of fully 
developed aids will be reported during the coming year 
if we adopt the conservative estimate then 5 million people 
are infected today with hiv the aids virus a cumulative total of 
1 million aids cases would be expected by 1991 he said thus 
the period 198891 will likely witness over five times more aids 
cases than have thus far occurred 
dr jean william pape of the cornell university medical college 
told the panel the epidemic in haiti and trinidad is shifting 
dramatically to one of heterosexual transmission 
whereas only 26 percent of the cases reported in haiti 1983 were 
believed to have resulted from heterosexual sex the number jumped 
to 64 percent last year 
in trinidad he said only 12 percent of the cases reported in 
1985 were attributed to likely heterosexual sex compared to 58 
percent last year

paul reveres laryngitis made it hard for him to 
shout the british are coming william dawes got locked in a 
mens room during a rest stop and the rain made slippery manholes 
treacherous for the patriots horses 
otherwise patriots day on monday was the occasion of a 
satisfactory restaging of the 13mile mission to lexington 213 
years ago that alerted revolutionary colonists that british troops 
were heading their way 
im ready to go back harold snow said in a cracking voice 
at the end of the 2hour horseback ride from boston it was the 
seventh portrayal of paul revere for the 72yearold entrepreneur 
from wellesley who is a brigadier general in the massachusetts 
national lancers 
for decades the ceremonial militia of 30 men has roughly 
recreated in daytime the horseback ride that revere dawes and dr 
samuel prescott made in the late hours of april 18 1775 
by alerting the insurrectionary colonists that british troops 
were on their way to concord the 18th century trio set in motion 
the next days confrontation that started the american revolution 
monday douglas dougherty a lieutenant in the lancers who 
portrayed dawes was freed from a mens room in arlington in time 
to meet up with snow for their grand finale in lexington where they 
were met by a cheering crowd estimated at 500 people 
this years journey was considerably harder than the one taken 
the first time around just before snow left boston with a sendoff 
from mayor raymond flynn he groused about the rain his costume of 
threecornered hat wig cloak and boots made for a hot ride 
compared to reveres who had the advantage of a cool clear night 
and his own clothes 
snow also had to watch out for slippery manholes 
but snow said he enjoyed himself and was grateful for the 
audience along the way that ignored the boston marathon 
when snow left bostons north end where revere lived in a house 
that still stands a throng of spectators stood under store awnings 
and a makeshift canopy of umbrellas there were grinning toddlers 
graying babyboomers taking off for the state holiday and elderly 
italian widows 
this is how america was founded said patti gant an 
accountant from everett who recommended historical reenactments 
as a way to understand this country 
youve got to get the concept of where you come from to know 
where you go from here said ms gant 50 
frank federico 35 a pharmacist who grew up in the old narrow 
streets of the north end said hes been coming to see revere ride 
off his entire life thats why he brought his 10yearold son 
michael he said 
its a family tradition the elder federico said with a nod 
toward his son its important to see what you read about in the 
classroom

american ballet theater opened its twomonth 
season at the metropolitan opera house with panache the kind of 
dancing style and brio that expects deserves and receives bravos 
mondays program began with mikhail baryshnikovs new production 
and staging of raymonda grand pas classique martine van 
hamel a commanding stage presence as well as a glorious ballerina 
was partnered superbly by kevin mckenzie 
amanda mckerrow who danced the fourth solo variation which 
requires lightness long extension and some difficult balances has 
blossomed into the ballerina her early promise predicted 
baryshnikov staged the ballet after marius petipa incorporating 
the grand pas de dix from act 3 and several variations from the 
fulllength raymonda music is by glazounov 
antony tudor who died last year choreographed the leaves are 
fading for american ballet theater in 1975 the music is by 
dvorak sometimes this seems merely an overlong pretty ballet in 
which the womens thin skirts ripple as the men lift them and they 
seem to float 
on monday it was a beautiful ballet the various moods were 
strongly defined there is much more than a pastel sense of autumn 
and saying goodby exquisite dancing which was seen opening night 
is important dim lighting instead of very noticeable dappled 
lighting helps too allowing the dancers and the music to hold 
prominence 
leslie browne and robert hill were the nimble leading couple 
their virtuosic dancing having a carefree air about it 
the evening ended with the first new york performance of the 
companys production of george balanchines ballet imperial 
the company looks comfortable with this balanchine piece which is 
more classical than his usual he based it on the petipa style 
also in this 1941 ballet there are intertwinings which are 
balanchine trademarks 
ballet imperial is as visually regal as the raymonda 
which began the evening and the dancing was as glittering as the 
womens small crowns susan jaffe and ross stretton were the 
impressive leading couple and miss mckerrow distinguished herself 
again in solos 
michael boriskin was the thundering soloist in tchaikovskys 
second piano concerto for ballet imperial jack everly 
conducted the entire evening

employers in areas of low joblessness are 
increasingly turning to using teenagers in violation of child 
labor laws as an alternative to paying higher wages to attract and 
retain adults labor department officials say 
illegal employment of children increased by more than 50 percent 
in 1987 the labor department said monday it said the most 
dramatic increase in violations occurred in the northeast where 
unemployment rates are lowest 
because of the high levels of employment were finding a lot 
of firms hiring minors illegally for positions formerly held by 
older workers said nancy flynn deputy administrator of the 
departments wagehour division its a trend in that geographic 
region 
the number of children nationwide that the department found to 
be illegally employed last year was slightly more than 19000 up 
from 12662 in 1986 
the department said it assessed civil fines totaling 15 
million last year against 811 companies illegally employing 10160 
minors 
under the labor protection laws children ages 14 and 15 can 
hold limited nonhazardous jobs but the number of hours they can 
work is restricted children ages 16 and 17 can work fulltime but 
not in dangerous occupations such as roofing excavation work and 
mining or around hazardous machinery 
the biggest violator the department said was a large chain of 
supermarkets in the northeast which was working children too many 
hours a week and illegally employing them in hazardous occupations 
such as meat cutting 
ms flynn would not identify the supermarket chain saying the 
case is still being litigated 
the department said it found that nearly 488000 us workers 
were cheated out of 126 million last year through employer 
violations of minimum wage overtime pay and other provisions of 
the fair labor standards act 
at least 155000 workers were due 285 million in minimum wage 
violations and 329000 employers were underpaid at total of 98 
million in overtime due them said assistant labor secretary fred 
alvarez 
of those amounts the department recovered about 202 million 
in minimum wages for 136000 of the workers who were underpaid and 
795 million for 293000 of those not paid overtime 
the department also assessed 873430 in civil penalties against 
farm labor contractors for violations of pay and health and safety 
standards under the migrant worker protection act

a 28room mansion built as a wedding 
gift has gained a reputation of bringing bad luck to those who live 
there three of its residents have faced criminal charges two have 
lost their fortunes and one killed himself 
the latest owners of dunnellen hall are real estate tycoons 
harry and leona helmsley who were indicted last week on new york 
state and federal tax charges 
it wasnt the happiest home said marjorie rowe president 
of preferred properties inc who handled two of the sales of the 
mansion it seems as if some very wealthy people who lived there 
lost their fortunes if the walls could talk 
the house sits on 26 acres in greenwich hometown to such 
notables as donald trump and diana ross the average price of a 
home here is about 1 million real estate agents say 
it was built in 1918 at a cost of 1 million for daniel grey 
reid president of the american tin plate co as a wedding gift 
for his daughter rhea she married henry j topping son of john 
a topping president of republic steel 
the estate referred to locally as the topping house was 
named dunnellen hall by rhea reid topping for her mother ella dunn 
it was sold for the first time in 1950 to loring washburn 
president of sh pormeroy amp co a steel fabricating company but 
he suffered financial troubles and lost the house in 1963 
others who have had trouble after they moved into the house were 
daniel moran a former new york city policeman who was married 
to gregg sherwood dodge a heiress to the dodge automobile fortune 
moran shot and killed a busboy who apparently was trying to climb 
into the bedroom window of their florida home in 1968 the slaying 
was ruled justifiable homicide 
moran killed himself in 1977 although a judge would not say 
whether the shooting was intentional or accidental 
investor jack dick he was indicted by a new york city grand 
jury on 46 counts of grand larceny and forgery for allegedly 
stealing 840000 through the use of false documents to obtain a 
loan 
he pleaded innocent in 1971 the case was pending when he died 
suddenly in 1974 at the age of 46 while being driven to the estate 
by his chauffeur 
ravi tikkoo owner of the one of the worlds largest oil 
supertankers he lost the bulk of his fortune during the opec oil 
embargo and petroleum shortages in the mid1970s 
the helmsleys one of the worlds wealthiest couples at an 
estimated 14 billion and with a stake in the empire state 
building bought the estate in 1983 for 11 million 
the helmsleys pleaded innocent last week to charges in a 
188count new york state tax evasion indictment they are accused 
by new york officials of avoiding taxes by claiming about 4 
million in renovations to dunnellen hall as business expenses at 
their hotels 
the couple also face a 47count federal indictment on similar 
charges 
phyllis parizek a spokeswoman for the connecticut department of 
revenue services said monday that two auditors had been assigned 
to examine the helmsleys finances 
last week timothy f bannon state commisioner of revenue 
services said his investigators were taking a close look at the 
new york charges to determine if any connecticut taxes were owed on 
items at the estate 
one of the helmsleys attorneys stephen kaufman said monday 
that he thought the couple would not fall victim to the curse 
im sure the helmsleys have broken the bad luck streak at 
dunnnellen kaufman said 
louis duff president of duff associates inc which handled the 
sale of the estate for lynda dick widow of jack dick said the 
property had been compared to a famous gem with a bad reputation 
she lynda said this place is like the hope diamond 
everyone who ever owned it and lived here had bad luck duff said 
monday i argued with lynda at the time but i wouldnt argue 
with her today 
according to the book diamonds eternal by victor argenzio 
the gem was owned by louis xvi who went to guillotine with his 
wife a dutch cutter who changed the stones appearance had the 
stone stolen from him by his own son who later killed himself 
turkish sultan abdul hamid ii lost his throne and had to 
abdicate shortly after aquiring stone in 1908 the book said 
later after edward and evalyn mclean acquired the stone their 
first son was killed in an auto crash and mclean was implicated in 
the teapot dome scandal and died in mental institution 
after mrs mcleans death in 1947 the diamond was purchased by 
harry winston who gave it to the current owner the smithsonian 
institution in washington

a congressional study is giving fresh 
ammunition to conservationists and lawmakers who want to end the 
bigbucks losses sustained by taxpayers from timber sales in 
americas largest national forest 
weighing in on the side of the sales programs critics the 
general accounting office says congress should scrap the 1980 law 
requiring the us forest service to market a minimum amount of 
timber from tongass national forest in alaska 
gao the investigative wing of congress said in a study 
released monday that the requirement cost the treasury 221 
million in 1986 and has not created the lumbering jobs it was 
supposed to in southeast alaska 
the 1980 law directs the forest service to offer to sell at 
least 45 billion board feet of tongass timber each decade and 
guarantees at least 40 million in spending a year to support the 
sales program 
the law resulted from a compromise worked out by 
conservationists and alaska lawmakers in return for the guarantee 
program conservationists would get 54 million of the forests 
168 million acres declared wilderness putting them offlimits to 
commercial use 
the tongass is the only national forest with a minimum sales 
goal set by law although sen james mcclure ridaho has proposed 
a similar guarantee for the panhandle national forest in his state 
last month the house interior committee approved legislation to 
repeal the tongass guarantee a similar bill is pending in the 
senate energy and natural resources committee 
the proposals are being pushed by environmental and conservation 
groups who say the guarantee leads to lost tax dollars unnecessary 
roadbuilding by the forest service and needless harvesting of 
400yearold trees 
the gao study requested by sens william proxmire dwis and 
ted stevens ralaska said sales of tongass timber should be 
subject to market supplyanddemand forces 
gao said that from 1981 through 1986 sales of tongass timber 
averaged 245 million board feet a year some 205 million below the 
yearly average needed to meet the 10year goal 
focusing on 1986 gao said the forest service spent 479 
million on the tongass and realized only 33 million in revenues 
the net loss was 221 million because some spending was for timber 
production in future years according to the study 
from 1981 through 1986 131 million was spent to prepare for 
timber sales that were not needed to meet existing demand the 
study said 
the timber supply provision should be revised so that the 
amount supplied would be based on the anticipated demand for timber 
and on the data currently being formulated by the forest service 
rather than on a rigid perdecade requirement the study said 
gao said tongassrelated timber jobs declined from 2700 in 1980 
to 1420 in 1986 primarily because of the decreased harvest 
levels resulting from declining demand for timber and increased 
production by the alaska native corporations that directly compete 
with the tongass timber industry 
the forest service chief f dale robertson said in a letter to 
gao that the proposal to scrap the tongass guarantee has merit 
stevens said in a prepared statement that gao focused on a 
lowdemand portion of an economic cycle and that timber has since 
rebounded he said money must be spent on the tongass even in slack 
periods in order to meet peak demand 
he also said the study is flawed because it focused only on the 
guarantee not on the other side of the 1980 compromise 
prohibiting commercial activities in nearly onethird of the 
tongass

knocking down barriers to trade among the 12 
countries of the european community by 1992 will also benefit 
outside countries such as the united states and japan a researcher 
says 
the main advantage to outside trading partners from greater 
unification would be in having only a single set of rules to deal 
with instead of a dozen said paolo cecchini assigned by the 
community to study the issue 
a foreign company that sells to only one of the 12 will have 
jumped over the culture gap he said monday 
ella krucoff press officer for the communitys washington 
office gave labeling requirements on european imports as an 
example now each of the 12 governments has its own rules 
cecchini added that since there would be no official 
discrimination against subsidiaries of foreign firms within the 
community they too would benefit from any additional growth 
cecchini said that over the medium term about five years 
new measures of unification also could create as many as 5 million 
new jobs in europe where unemployment is higher than in this 
country 
he said about 200 people have contributed to his project called 
the cost of noneurope the cost of not having unified the 
economy of the community yet in addition to cecchinis own italy 
members include britain france west germany belgium holland 
denmark ireland luxembourg spain portugal and greece 
together these countries have as many people as the united 
states turkey has also asked to join and community officials say 
norway sweden and austria are possibilities the european common 
market program is conducted under the auspices of the community 
cecchini noted that in some matters the community already has 
more unity than the united states for example a doctor licensed 
in one of the 12 countries is qualified to practice in all of them 
unlike the rules here which differ from state to state 
next month cecchini will start publishing more than 6000 pages 
of research he said his study has found that european economic 
gains from greater unification could be worth more than 300 
billion and prices paid by consumers could be 6 percent less than 
in a divided continent 
five million new jobs would cover half of europes unemployed 
or all the young unemployed he added 
he also cited the example of japanese auto exporters whose 
sales to italy are limited under a quota imposed by the italian 
government the effort is now being made to europeanize this 
quota so that japanese sales could go to any of the 12 countries 
on the same terms community officials emphasized there would have 
to be some hard bargaining with japan first 
michael calingaert is a state department official on leave to 
study the european effort for the national planning association a 
private group he said the european plans are moving ahead fast 
in 1957 industrialists were frightened of the possible results 
and opposed it he said now they are in favor 
he said the private sector is acting as if the effort will 
succeed and that attitude could be selffulfilling 
the idea of a unified europe which dates back centuries got a 
boost after world war ii when americans held up the economic 
advantages of a common market like that of the united states 
west european countries had to organize themselves to distribute 
the us aid offered in the marshall plan and began to eliminate 
import quotas in trade with one another 
in 1957 six of the present 12 members signed the treaty of rome 
pledging the removal of all barriers among them progress has been 
slow 
now things are accelerating cecchini said 
six months ago nobody was even talking about a central bank 
for the community now the prospect is that the summit meeting in 
hanover west germany in june will set up a study of something 
like the us federal reserve system

the disappearance of a leading nuclear 
scientist has taiwanese fuming at the united states and worrying 
about damage to their national security 
newspapers carried unconfirmed reports after col chang hsienyi 
vanished in midjanuary that he worked for the us central 
intelligence agency and might have turned over nuclear secrets to 
the americans 
chang was a deputy director of the official institute of nuclear 
energy research he disappeared while on leave from his post 
we immediately looked at this map maybe he fell off a 
cliff said liu kuangchi secretary general of the government 
atomic energy council as he moved to an office wall map of taiwan 
and traced a route along rugged interior roads 
but several local newspapers provided a different scenario for 
changs disappearance reporting that he was a cia informant who 
left for the united states with details about a taiwanese nuclear 
weapons program 
a us state department spokeswoman phyllis e oakley said in 
washington last month that the department had no comment on whether 
chang was an informant for the united states 
in taipei david hess spokesman for the american institute of 
taiwan which oversees us interests here has told the government 
and local media the institute has no idea of what happened to chang 
taiwan officials have repeatedly denied plans to build a nuclear 
bomb communist china has said the production of atomic weapons by 
taiwan would be reason to invade the island which beijing regards 
as a renegade province 
nevertheless the uproar over chang has increased antiamerican 
sentiment that already was brewing here because of washingtons 
tough trade talk with taiwan which last year had a record 16 
billion trade surplus with the united states 
although the united states in 1979 broke diplomatic relations 
with taiwan and recognized the communist china government 
washington remains the islands major trade partner and arms 
supplier the american institute of taiwan serves as an operative 
diplomatic and commercial link in the absence of an embassy 
i get a lot of hot reaction from my students said su chi a 
member of the institute of international relations who also teaches 
at national chengchi university until this point theres always 
been a huge reservoir of good will toward the united states but 
i think the reservoir has cracked 
the taiwan media which has given intense coverage to changs 
disappearance also has criticized the united states 
a march 25 commentary in the masscirculation china times said 
that no matter what the motive the act of stealing our defense 
secrets has invaded our national sovereignty and respect to a 
certain degree no one can interpret this as friendly 
behavior 
taiwan officials now believe chang is in washington they have 
asked the united states for information about him but the reagan 
administration claims it does not know his whereabouts 
deputy foreign minister john chang recently said taiwan cannot 
lodge a protest with the united states because we dont have 
evidence showing us government or cia involvement 
but jaw shaukong a maverick lawmaker from the governing 
nationalist party is demanding retaliatory action 
the government probably should expel some us diplomats 
from taiwan expel some cia it cannot keep silent said jaw who 
views the united states as an imperialist nation 
jaw said he fears chang took important military secrets 
possibly classified information about taiwans missile development 
program jaw added that he wonders if such material could fall into 
the hands of communist china 
liu the nuclear energy official noted that many of changs 
classmates worked on missile and airplane projects at the 
militaryrun chungshan institute of science and technology 
the government maintains however chang did not take any 
sensitive information from chungshan liu believes the missing 
scientist did not have access to such secrets even though he knew 
of work done by the nuclear energy research center staff for 
militaryrelated chungshan projects 
professor su believes changs disappearance is unlikely to cause 
a serious reevaluation of taiwaneseus relations but could 
eventually lead to public debate of the countrys nuclear policy 
in early april the masscirculation united daily news newspaper 
published a poll that indicated taiwan was split over the 
development of nuclear weapons 
according to the survey 35 percent of the 767 people polled by 
telephone said taiwan should make atomic bombs while 34 percent 
were against such a policy the poll with a margin of error of 35 
percentage points indicated most people believe taiwan is capable 
of making the weapons 
nearly threefourths of the respondents said that if taiwan 
developed nuclear weapons they should not be used against mainland 
china

critics of the ussoviet treaty banning 
mediumrange missiles should be satisfied with soviet assurances 
the pact covers both existing missiles and future weapons using 
exotic technologies the chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee says 
the state department told the committee on monday that the 
soviet position was spelled out last week in a conversation between 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
the dispute centers on the treaty signed dec 8 by president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev eliminating nuclear 
missiles with a range of 300 to 3400 miles 
the reagan administration said the treaty banned both existing 
missiles and any futuristic weapons such as those using lasers 
or beam rays as long as the weapons had a range covered by the 
treaty 
but critics including members of the senate armed services 
committee questioned whether the soviets might have a different 
view of the treaty and suggested that the ambiguity should be 
cleared up 
sen claiborne pell dri the chairman of the foreign 
relations committee said shevardnadzes unequivocal statement 
should allay concerns that have been raised about this subject 
pells committee sent the full senate a report monday that said 
the senate should approve the treaty and protect its constitutional 
rights by blocking presidential attempts to change the way treaties 
are interpreted 
the 515page report sums up the panels three months of hearings 
and its votes on the historic pact 
the report was approved by the same 172 majority which 
recommended two weeks ago that the treaty should be ratified by the 
full senate the opposition votes were cast by sens jesse helms 
rnc and larry pressler rsd 
ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators leaders 
of both parties estimate that 90 or more senators will support the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty when it finally comes to a 
vote 
publication of the committee report means the way is finally 
clear for formal consideration on the senate floor 
republicans say the most contentious issue will likely be the 
democraticbacked amendment that would bar the united states from 
changing the interpretation of the inf treaty 
the amendment approved 127 by the committee arises from a 
fight over the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
reagan has asserted that the white house can unilaterally change 
how the abm pact is viewed a move that would permit expanded 
star wars testing but congressional democrats dispute that 
claim 
a presidential right to adopt a different interpretation of a 
treaty irrespective of the understanding on which the senate based 
its consent would tend to nullify the senates share of the treaty 
power and thus undermine a basic provision of the constitution 
the report said 
the senates only recourse to prevent its share of the treaty 
power being nullified would be to attach elaborate and numerous 
conditions to treaties in order to have the senates understanding 
become an integral and explicit part of the ratification 
documents the report said 
such procedures could easily overburden the treaty process to 
the point of paralysis it warned

the nations community colleges meet 
ambivalence about their role and often receive the states budget 
leftovers when they can be of great help both to their 
neighborhoods and the nation an educational commission said today 
the community college at its best can be a center for 
problemsolving in adult illiteracy or the education of the 
disabled said a report by the commission on the future of 
community colleges it can also be the place where education and 
business leaders meet to talk about the problems of displaced 
workers 
it can bring together agencies to strengthen services for 
minorities working women single parent heads of households and 
unwed teenage parents the community college can take the lead 
in longrange planning for community development and it can serve 
as the focal point for improving the quality of life in the inner 
city 
community colleges enroll 43 percent of the nations 
undergraduates and 51 percent of all firsttime freshmen but the 
schools encounter ambivalence in the larger community about their 
role and mission and competing priorities within the college 
the report said 
such schools are threatened by excessive fragmentation and 
division and increasing cultural separations and racial tensions 
the report said 
we propose therefore that the theme building communities 
become the new rallying point for the community college in america 
we define the term community not only as a region to be served 
but also as a climate to be created 
the commission was headed by ernest l boyer former us 
commissioner of education and president of the carnegie foundation 
for the advancement of teaching it conducted the study for the 
american association of community and junior colleges 
the panel said community colleges must help solve the dropout 
problem or minority students will continue to leave it recommended 
that every college develop an aggressive outreach plan for 
disadvantaged students 
among other recommendations 
an early warning system to spot and help students who are 
at risk of dropping out 
each community college should commit itself to recruiting and 
retaining a topquality faculty and increase the percentage of 
members who are black hispanic and asian 
careful assessment of reading writing and mathematical ability 
of all firsttime community college students and an intensive 
developmental education program for those who need it 
completion of a core curriculum by all associate degree 
students

a federal judge says he must decide whether to 
approve a flawed consent decree regulating allterrain vehicles or 
do nothing to regulate the vehicles blamed for 900 deaths in five 
years 
is it best to move in the direction of doing what one can do 
to reduce it as opposed to doing nothing about it us district 
judge gerhard a gesell said after a hearing on a proposed 
outofcourt settlement between the consumer product safety 
commission and five manufacturers 
opponents of the consent decree argued at mondays hearing that 
the agreement between federal regulators and manufacturers is 
flawed because it doesnt provide for refunds to people who 
purchased the vehicles popularly known as atvs 
lawyers for consumer groups and 32 states said the consent 
decree also fails to protect children from the hazards of the 
fourwheel machines particularly smaller models marketed for 
children which would still be sold 
we dont believe these childsized atvs should be sold at 
all said massachusetts attorney general james shannon who 
called atvs some of the most dangerous consumer products sold in 
this country 
the decree would ban future sales of threewheel atvs unless the 
manufacturers devised performance standards that would be approved 
by the cpsc it would also require warning labels on fourwheel 
models and distributors would have to offer training about the safe 
use of the machines to owners of vehicles currently in use 
gesell appeared troubled by the decrees ban on further action 
by the cpsc against atvs during the 10year period the agreement is 
in effect 
the mechanism provided by congress is stymied by the consent 
decree gesell told a lawyer for the manufacturers 
as i understand the decree the agency represented here cpsc 
is not able to issue a rule under the statute which would be in 
many respects more severe than the sanctions imposed by the 
consent decree gesell said 
you take the agency out of the game you cant tell me with 
quite the same assurance the agency is going to continue to perform 
its function the judge said 
sen alfonse damato rny who is sponsoring legislation to 
force manufacturers to give refunds called that provision a wolf 
in sheeps clothing 
the senator urged gesell to modify the decree to give the agency 
the option of taking further action after a year or 18 months if 
the agreement has not led to safer use of atvs 
but justice department attorney stephen hart said the agreement 
allows the government to avoid a lengthy court battle during which 
it would be difficult to prove the allegations that the atvs are an 
imminent hazard as defined by the consumer protection statute 
this is an outstanding resolution of the matter in light of 
the facts as they exist and the law as it exists hart told 
gesell the government will get some of what it asked for the 
other alternative is the government will get none of what it asked 
for 
gesell also expressed concern about the mechanics for 
supervising the decrees enforcement saying he was particularly 
dismayed that it empowered the cpscs general counsel to extend 
deadlines 
nevertheless the judge said the unprecedented decree could be 
a technique that could be of great value to consumers

the senate has some bad news for boat owners 
who hate to scrape barnacles off the hull 
the chamber gave voicevote approval monday to legislation to 
regulate the use of tributyltin or tbt a hull paint additive that 
is effective against barnacles but poses dangers to other marine 
life 
the bill would ban the use of paints containing tbt on vessels 
under 82 feet in length and would impose limits on the amount of 
tbt that can be released into the water from hull paint on larger 
vessels 
the restrictions would last until the environmental protection 
agency decides on an environmentally safe release rate for paints 
containing tbt which have been regulated by england and france 
because of damage to shellfish 
sen john chafee rri said tbt is without a doubt the most 
effective antifouling compound yet developed and it cannot be 
matched for preventing the attachment of barnacles algae and other 
marine organisms that hasten the decay of wood and cause drag on 
boats 
on the other hand there is growing evidence that tbt is 
extremely toxic and is affecting nontarget marine and freshwater 
organisms rather than just organisms that are trying to grow on 
boat hulls 
he said tbt produces toxic effects in some marine organisms at 
exposures of less than 100 parts per trillion the equivalent to 
one drop of water in 100000 tanker trucks of liquid 
chafee said tbts effects on humans are not known although high 
levels of the substance have been found in some chinook salmon by 
federal researchers 
the regulatory legislation originated in the house which now 
will be asked to consider an amendment approved by the senate

new bedford mass was the nations richest 
fishing port last year thanks to a banner year for scallops 
government and industry officials say 
other new england fishing cities slumped because of a decrease 
in fin fish such as cod and haddock and some ports around the gulf 
of mexico suffered from problems in the shrimp industry analysts 
said monday 
new bedford led in 1987 with catches valued at 1437 million 
up nearly 36 percent from 106 million in 1986 according to the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration the 1987 figure 
was a record the agency said 
lee weddig executive vice president of the national fisheries 
institute a trade association attributed new bedfords big 
increase to strong scallop harvests and scallop price increases 
noaa said scallops accounted for nearly half of new bedfords 
total dollar value but made up only 21 percent of the ports catch 
in weight 
alaskan ports also enjoyed a profitable year kodiak was second 
to new bedford with catches valued at 1321 million up from 898 
million and dutch harborunalaska was up from 372 million to 
627 million noaa reported 
weddig said the healthy pacific northwest industry was due to 
strong salmon and crab harvests and a sharp increase in exports due 
to the fall of the dollar overseas 
nationwide foreign sales in 1987 were more than 2 billion up 
from 16 billion the previous year according to weddig 
texas and louisiana ports suffered from falling shrimp 
production and prices he said 
cameron la led the nation for the 10th consecutive year in 
the amount of fish caught noaa reported cameron landings rose 
from 6168 million pounds to 6724 million pounds bringing it 
nearly back to its 1985 level the record was 8482 million pounds 
landed in los angeles in 1960 
pascagoulamoss point miss was second at 3916 million 
pounds up from 3655 million pounds 
more than twothirds of the major us fishing ports were up in 
volume from last year but nearly half had value decreases 
while new bedford enjoyed a robust year most of the other major 
new england fishing ports suffered declines in both volume and 
value according to the noaa report 
down in both categories were gloucester mass point judith 
ri and boston only portland maine showed increases largely 
because of the operation of the new portland fish exchange weddig 
said 
he said decreases in cod haddock and flounder as well as the 
emergence of the portland exchange led to the decline in landings 
at the other new england ports

lawmakers are nearing final action on a 
sweeping 1000page trade bill still uncertain if it will contain 
a plan to force public disclosure by foreign investors of their 
us holdings 
if youre interested in passing a trade bill which i am then 
i think the best course of action is to drop the bryant 
amendment sen j james exon dneb said monday after 
lawmakers failed to break a deadlock over the issue 
a housesenate panel has been stalemated for more than a month 
over the amendment sponsored by rep john bryant dtexas which 
would require public disclosure of much foreign investment within 
the united states 
exon said that dropping the plan would reduce the chance of a 
presidential veto or if president reagan vetoes the bill anyway 
increase the chance of an override 
he noted there already are presidential veto threats over a 
separate provision that would require 60day notice of plant 
closings and largescale layoffs 
the foreign ownership dispute is the last unresolved controversy 
in fashioning the trade bill which house speaker jim wright 
dtexas said could come to the floor as early as wednesday 
most of the compromise provisions were drawn up by house and 
senate conferees before the congressional recess easter week but 
they left farm items the plant closings feature and the foreign 
disclosure plan until the last minute 
wright told reporters he was pushing for inclusion of the bryant 
provision but he added he would not seek to attach the measure to 
the trade bill if it would put its life in jeopardy 
the speaker said that if conferees would not accept the plan i 
would be inclined to give bryant a run on its own merits by 
bringing it to the house floor later as a separate bill 
under the plan foreign investors would be required to register 
with the commerce department if they owned 5 percent or more of any 
american company or real estate in this country if such assets were 
worth at least 5 million 
some of this information already must be filed with the 
department but is not public record that would change under 
bryants plan 
companies with a 25 percent share in a us business or property 
with assets or annual sales of more than 20 million would have to 
disclose much of the detailed information required of corporations 
by the securities and exchange commission on its 10k form the 
items range from a list of directors and officers to a financial 
balance sheet 
critics say the measure would reduce new capital from overseas 
that helps prime the us economic pump proponents say it would 
put a spotlight on foreign investment that could be harmful to 
american interests 
most lawmakers believe the trade bill itself will clear both the 
house and senate without much difficulty the question is whether 
it will get the twothirds support it would need for a veto 
override 
three major petroleum industry associations called on reagan to 
sign the bill because it would repeal the windfall profits tax on 
oil companies 
we cannot allow the stagnation of domestic oil exploration and 
production to continue the groups said in a letter 
the letter was sent by the american petroleum institute the 
independent petroleum association of america and the midcontinent 
gas and oil association

funds deficit did not threaten depositors money in the countrys 
3126 federally insured savings and loans 
no one has ever lost a dime in an insured deposit and no one 
ever will lose a dime federal home loan bank board member 
lawrence white said monday congress has spoken to that 
the board oversees the sampl deposit insurance fund which insures 
deposits up to 100000 
bank board officials said the estimated costs of closing or 
merging ailing sampls totaled 116 billion more than the funds 
assets at the end of 1987 that figure compares with a deficit of 
63 billion at the end of 1986 
bank board officials conceded that even this sharply higher 
figure was disputed by congressional auditors who contend it is 
too low 
the deficit figure underscores the problems facing the sampl 
industry where hundreds of institutions are insolvent but are kept 
open because the government cannot afford to close them and pay off 
depositors 
the new report estimated it will cost 153 billion to close or 
sell 204 savings and loans which are considered to be in the worst 
shape 
when 37 billion in fund assets are subtracted from the 153 
billion in expected liabilities fslic is left with an estimated 
deficit of 116 billion 
however the figure of 204 insolvent sampls represents only the 
worst financial cases another 306 institutions were also insolvent 
at the end of the year under generally accepted accounting 
principles 
the fslic report estimated that if all of these institutions had 
to be rescued it would add another 65 billion to the amount of 
money the insurance fund will be obligated to pay out 
white defended the 65 billion estimate saying not all of the 
additional sampls will actually need assistance and the institutions 
representing the biggest drain on the funds had already been 
included in the first group of 204 sampls 
however critics contend that a figure of around 30 billion is 
a much more reasonable estimate and that the costs could climb as 
high as 60 billion for solving the industrys problems far above 
the amount approved by congress last year 
in august president reagan signed legislatio to pump 108 
billion into fslic over the next three years through the sale of 
bonds which will be paid off by a special assessment on profitable 
institutions 
there have been reports that the reagan administration is 
beginning to study alternative methods of financing because of the 
threat the soaring fslic deficit poses to efforts to reduce the 
overall federal budget deficit 
the ideas being considered reportedly range from merging fslic 
with the healthy federal deposit insurance corp which insures 
funds at banks or tapping into the money generated each year by 
the federal home loan mortgage corp popularly known as freddie 
mac which congress created in 1970 to funnel money from investors 
to home buyers 
freddie mac president leland c brendsel said that diverting his 
companys income stream to assist fslic is an idea that doesnt 
stand up to financial scrutiny 
white said it was premature to consider major changes to get 
more money for fslic 
he said that the sampl fund will have 20 billion at its disposal 
over the next three years and that this amount would be sufficient 
to deal with the worst problems facing the industry he said the 
new president would have plenty of time to study what further 
resources would be needed

jesse jackson told a business group he favors 
continued research on the star wars missile defense system and then 
told an east harlem audience a few hours later we do not need 
star wars we need decent housing and education and day care 
robert borosage a top adviser to jacksons presidential 
campaign said the former civil rights activist has always 
supported research on star wars but it was not until the new york 
primary campaign that jackson began to readily discuss his support 
for that research 
keep the research we dont need to deploy it jackson told 
the association for a better new york an organization of business 
and civic leaders a few hours before his east harlem appearance 
an even more publicized shift in position was jacksons 
statement that he would not meet with yasser arafat the leader of 
the palestine liberation organization 
ten years ago jackson embraced arafat at a meeting that became 
a focus of jewish opposition to his candidacy 
during an interview on the cbs show face the nation 
jackson said arafat was an extreme element in the middle east 
and that it would be a mistake to negotiate with him 
on the same program jackson said he had no plans to scrap 
existing weapons in the us arsenal including many he opposed in 
the past 
is jackson shifting toward the mainstream as he has become a 
credible challenger to michael dukakis claim on the democratic 
presidential nomination 
ann lewis a top jackson adviser called the shifts part of a 
twoway evolution 
she said that as jackson has been taken more seriously as a 
presidential candidate he has been asked more substantive policy 
questions and they have forced him to reexamine many of his views 
his position on star wars has been the same since reagan 
launched it said borosage but he conceded the candidates 
stance on any arafat role in middle east negotiations has changed 
he believes youve got to deal with the plo said borosage 
but he added jackson also has come to believe that arafat is too 
inciteful to be included in peace negotiations 
jackson has explained his earlier meeting with arafat as an 
effort to persuade the plo leader to accept israels right to 
exist he repeatedly told new york audiences that israel must be 
guaranteed secure borders he also has advocated an independent 
palestinian state 
in the cbs interview jackson also denied having advocated 
elimination of such systems as the mx missile 
weve got to keep the systems we have said jackson 
in a letter published in mondays new york times borosage took 
issue with a story on jacksons views that had appeared in the 
newspaper 
mr jackson has never stated he would scrap a range of 
weapons systems already deployed wrote borosage 
however he went on to say that the candidate would oppose 
further development of the stealth bomber because we have just 
spent billions purchasing the b1 for the same mission 
in speeches jackson advocates a freeze in the military budget

here are highlights from the report by the 
presidents commission on aviation safety 
the nations air transportation system is safe for now 
but the government regulatory structure designed to ensure 
aviation safety is inadequate to deal with future growth and 
technological change 
a major structural overhaul of the federal aviation 
administration is needed making it an independent agency outside 
the transportation department 
an independent aviation safety czar should be appointed as 
part of the new faa and given authority to oversee safety matters 
with a sevenyear term the new aviation safety director could 
initiate new safety rules and block proposed regulations 
no need has been demonstrated for reimposing federal 
regulation of the airline industry although the government must 
streamline its regulatory activities to deal with rapidly changing 
events in a deregulated industry 
surveillance of airlines should be improved with heavier 
reliance on indepth inspections surprise inspections and closer 
examination of airlines undergoing major changes 
safety requirements for commuter airlines should elevated 
gradually to the same level as those for larger commercial airlines 
small private planes flying near major airports should be 
required to have equipment that informs ground controllers of their 
altitude

farm prices of food commodities averaged 
higher in 1987 after declining for two years and retail grocery 
prices rose even faster says an agriculture department report 
so for the third straight year farmers got a declining share of 
the consumer food dollar an average of 29 percent or 29 cents 
out of every dollar spent at grocery stores for a marketbasket 
list of food items 
the farm value share of the retail price of food in the market 
basket has declined at least one percentage point each year a 
penny of each dollar spent since it averaged 34 percent or 34 
cents in the 1984 calendar year 
according to usda records going back to 1913 when farmers got 
46 percent of the food dollar the annual share has been at record 
low levels the last three years 31 percent in 1985 30 percent in 
1986 and 29 percent in 1987 
previously the low mark was a farm value share of 32 percent 
during 1932 and 1933 in the depths of the depression it rose to 
more than 50 percent during world war ii and for a few years after 
with 29 percent of the retail cost of market basket going to 
farmers that means the remaining 71 percent went to those who 
handle raw food products after they leave the farm 
the market basket contains average quantities of domestically 
produced food bought in grocery stores excluding nonalcoholic 
beverages and fish and seafood 
department economists use several basic components to describe 
what happens to the market basket each year 
farm value represents prices farmers receive for the raw 
commodities equivalent to foods in the market basket 
the farmtoretail price spread is the difference between the 
retail price and the farm value the price spread is the charge for 
processing distributing and retailing foods 
the farm value share is the proportion the farmer gets from the 
amount consumers spend on marketbasket food sold in grocery stores 
in 1987 the departments economic research service said monday 
in its annual report the farm value of food increased 27 percent 
but the retail store price of the market basket rose 5 percent and 
the price spread increased 6 percent 
that caused the farm value share to decline again to the 
record low of 29 percent 
while useful as an indicator to track where consumer food 
dollars go the market basket does not tell the overall story for 
example the agency said that food prices overall including all 
items eaten at home and away from home rose an average of 41 
percent in 1987 compared with 32 percent in 1986 
that was the sharpest annual increase since 1981 and included a 
43 percent gain for grocery prices and 4 percent for food eaten 
away from home 
food prices rose more at supermarkets and other grocery stores 
than at eating places for the first time in nine years the 
report said 
looking further at the market basket economists said the farm 
share declined to 29 percent because abundant food supplies held 
down farm prices while rising food processing and distributing 
charges forced up prices at retail stores 
the size of the farm value share is not a direct measure of 
the welfare of producers but a shortrun decrease often accompanies 
a decline in farm income the report said last year net farm 
income increased but mainly because of higher government 
payments

an additional 175000 metric tons of us 
wheat has been sold to the soviet union at subsidized prices under 
an agriculture department export program 
the sale equal to about 642 million bushels was handled by 
artfer inc 100000 tons and continental grain co 75000 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said monday the grain was sold under 
terms of the longterm grain agreement between the united states 
and the soviet union 
sims said the subsidies averaged 2446 per ton or about 67 
cents per bushel of wheat 
no selling prices were announced but wheat has been averaging 
about 285 per bushel recently according to the usda that could 
mean a farm value of about 18 million 
the pact which expires sept 30 calls on moscow to buy at 
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the 
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans 
so far the soviets have bought more than 86 million tons of 
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year as well as 41 
million tons of nonsubsidized corn 818400 tons of us soybeans 
and 13 million tons of soybean meal 
subsidies are provided under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep private exporters are given surplus commodities 
owned by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodities at competitive 
world prices 
sims said the soviets have only 10200 tons remaining in their 
current eep authorization which was announced on april 4

a harvard university study strongly endorses 
canadian electricity imports as a cheap alternative to mideast oil 
and rejects a proposal from the domestic coal industry to limit the 
hydroelectric power 
the report released monday by the energy and environmental 
policy center at harvards john f kennedy school of government 
dismisses arguments that canadian producers have unfair advantages 
over domestic utilities 
it also dismisses assertions that reliance on canadian imports 
could leave the united states vulnerable and that government 
subsidies and lower environmental standards make the exports 
possible 
instead it says canadian utilities can export hydroelectric 
power at a cheaper price than it costs to build new coal facilities 
because of canadas vast water resources 
arguments about canadian subsidies lax environmental 
standards and national security implications are not only often 
factually wrong but also divert attention from the real public 
policy issue said henry lee executive director of the center 
and coauthor of the study 
if canada has greater access to inexpensive natural resources 
should the us federal government limit the ability of us 
consumers to purchase those resources lee asked 
the harvard researchers estimated that the 35300 gigawatt hours 
of canadian electricity purchased by the united states in 1986 
would increase by 1995 to between 52000 and 63000 gigawatt hours 
a gigawatt is a billion watts 
canadian power imports represent only 2 percent of us 
consumption nationwide but they account for about 10 percent of 
the electricity used in new england and new york 
the 75000 study was paid in large part by utilities that 
benefit from canadian imports 
lee said buying large chunks of canadian power does not pose a 
national security risk since it is unlikely canada would cut off 
electricity for political reasons 
the security costs of any practically attainable level of 
canadian imports are far outweighed by the national security 
benefits which accrue to the united states from reducing oil 
imports from mideast nations the report said 
rep nick joe rahall ii dwva countered political 
relationships are volatile with changes in leadership and in no 
way can we use todays stable relationship with canada as a basis 
for the future 
rahall chairman of the house interior subcommittee on mining 
and natural resources introduced legislation last year that would 
prohibit canadian power imports unless they adhered to 
environmental safeguards similar to those in the united states 
the study also said that canadian imports displace mostly 
imported oil and domestic natural gas not coal 
if all canadian power contracts were cancelled the coal 
industry would see a 2479 increase in jobs but it would cost us 
consumers 114123 per job the study said

the government and rebel leaders 
adjourned peace talks monday without reaching agreement after four 
days but they agreed to meet again in managua at the end of the 
month 
gen humberto ortega the defense minister and head of the 
sandinista governments negotiating team read a statement signed 
by both parties saying they would meet in the capital april 2830 
to continue talks on a permanent truce in the 6yearold war 
adolfo calero a leader of the rebels known as contras told 
reporters the two sides were on the road to an understanding 
he refused to elaborate on what they discussed during the talks 
this isnt an automobile race in indianapolis to run at 200 
miles per hour ortega said our interest is to negotiate the 
definitive ceasefire but it cant be reached overnight for which 
we consider that what was discussed here was an advance and not a 
failure 
he claimed the rebels political directorate was being pressured 
to avoid signing an agreement by the contra military chief enrique 
bermudez 
our army will continue clutching their rifles to dissuade the 
enemies of sapoa and im referring to enrique bermudez and the 
guerrillas so that they dont continue sabotaging the accords 
ortega said sapoa is the town where the two sides signed a 
ceasefire agreement last month 
president daniel ortega the defense ministers brother told a 
rally monday night that the contra political leaders should not 
cave in to what he said was pressure from the united states and 
bermudez 
addressing thousands of sandinista supporters in managuas plaza 
de la revolucion the president claimed bermudez had told contra 
political leaders that if they signed a truce with the government 
the rebels would liquidate them 
he said if the political leaders submit to the pressures of 
the yankee administration and the threats of bermudez they would 
not continue to come to managua and if they did it would be to 
break the sapoa accords 
if this happens it would leave us no other road but to 
achieve a total victory in the military field 
negotiations between the rebels and government have been 
deadlocked over the socalled democratization issue 
the sandinistas have insisted the rebels sign a permanent truce 
immediately they say contra delegates would then be allowed to 
take part in a national reconciliation dialogue with leaders of 
the countrys 14 legally recognized political parties 
contra leaders are demanding that sandinistas first carry out a 
series of democratic reforms or at least pledge to do so 
on monday afternoon contra leader alfredo cesar told a cheering 
crowd the rebels will press for an end to the military draft and 
the release of thousands of political prisoners 
we are in managua to negotiate with the sandinistas the 
freedom of nicaragua and the restoration of democracy and as long 
as we do not achieve this we will not lay down our weapons 
cesar told about 800 supporters in the capital 
he spoke outside la prensa before he and other contra leaders 
visited the editors of the only opposition newspaper 
cesar and five directors of the rebel umbrella group known as 
the nicaraguan resistance traveled to managua on friday to try to 
negotiate with the government an end to the war that has killed an 
estimated 26500 people 
it was the first time the sandinistas agreed to negotiate with 
their foes in the capital the contras 20minute visit to la 
prensa was their first venture outside the camino real hotel where 
they have been staying 
contra leaders visited with cardinal miguel obando y bravo and 
other roman catholic church officials in the afternoon and said 
afterward they would free 40 government soldiers 
at the request of the bishops we have decided to free the 
sandinista prisoners that we have in our power as a show of good 
faith for national reconciliation said calero highestranking 
official in the contra directorate 
official voice of nicaragua radio claimed the contras had more 
sandinista prisoners and releasing only 40 was ridiculous in 
seven years of war 
the two sides signed a peace agreement march 23 which provided 
for a temporary ceasefire while they negotiated a permanent truce 
the 60day ceasefire went into effect april 1 
the contras on monday proposed that the temporary ceasefire be 
extended another month while both sides seek agreement there was 
no immediate response from the government 
soon after the march 23 accord was signed the sandinistas freed 
100 of the 3300 political prisoners and promised to release the 
rest as peace negotiations progressed 
among the contra directors who visited la prensa monday was 
pedro joaquin chamorro whose mother violeta chamorro is 
publisher 
his publisher father also named pedro joaquin chamorro was 
killed on jan 10 1978 the assassination widely blamed on the 
rightwing government in power at the time unleashed a revolt that 
toppled president anastasio somoza and swept the sandinistas into 
power in july 1979

the securities and exchange commission 
believes that heavy program trading may have helped force down 
stock prices last jan 8 the day of the thirdworst market plunge 
in a report released monday the sec said it has detected high 
levels of computerdriven transactions late in that days session 
particularly in stocks frequently traded by institutional investors 
using programs 
the dow jones industrial average plunged 140 points that day 
the sec using information it obtained from the new york stock 
exchange said that 754 million of the 1973 million shares traded 
that day were sold after 230 pm twothirds of the decline 
occurred after 230 pm 
this heavy late selling activity occurred on relatively little 
fundamental economic news the report said 
the report stated that the role in the jan 8 plunge of 
indexrelated trading transactions involving baskets of stocks 
and futures was comparable to that during the week preceding 
oct 19 
that was the day of the worst plunge in the stock markets 
history a 508point dow jones decline 
the study concluded that stock selling from index arbitrage 
may have accelerated the steepest portion of the market decline 
that day after 230 pm 
index arbitrage is a strategy by which institutional traders 
usually using computers attempt to profit from price discrepancies 
between stocks and stock index futures it and other forms of 
socalled program trading in which computers guide huge 
transactions have been called factors in the stock markets wildly 
surging price swings of recent months 
the study said that only 13 percent of the shares traded jan 8 
were generated by program selling 
but more than onethird of the transactions after 230 pm 
involving stocks comprising the standard amp poors 500 stock index 
were made by program traders the report said stocks in the 
standard amp poors index are frequently bought and sold by program 
traders 
the report was released by rep edward j markey dmass 
chairman of the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
markey had requested the study which was dated april 7 and sent to 
the congressman by sec chairman david s ruder 
i am deeply concerned about the impact of this continued 
volatility on our capital formation process and longterm economic 
growth markey said in a prepared statement 
markey has been working on legislation designed to control 
market volatility

one of three israeli judges who convicted john 
demjanjuk of nazi war crimes said the death camp guard killed many 
people with his own hands and often exceeded the atrocities ordered 
by his superiors 
he took part in the murders and did so willingly 
enthusiastically judge dov levine said of the former ohio 
autoworker during the 12hour reading of the 450page judgment 
monday 
applause broke out in the courtroom when the court ruled that 
demjanjuk was ivan the terrible a guard who operated gas 
chambers that killed 850000 jews at the treblinka death camp in 
nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
the threejudge court convicted demjanjuk of war crimes crimes 
against the jewish people crimes against humanity and crimes 
against persecuted people demjanjuk 68 will be sentenced april 
25 and could receive the death penalty 
he was the second person to be convicted of nazi war crimes in 
israel adolf eichmann architect of the holocaust was convicted 
and hanged in 1962 
im an innocent man i will appeal and im sure ill win 
demjanjuk told reporters as he walked slowly from the courthouse to 
a police van his head bowed and his arms clasped 
demjanjuk maintained his innocence through the 14month trial 
saying he was a victim of mistaken identity 
demjanjuks lawyers and relatives accused the judges of bias 
as far as im concerned this was nothing more than a soviet 
show trial said demjanjuks son john jr 22 he and other 
family members stormed out of court in protest midway through the 
reading of the judgment 
holocaust survivor eliyahu rosenberg hugged a prosecution 
assistant after the verdict and exclaimed i feel better now 
said the assistant who would not give his name rosenberg was one 
of five treblinka survivors who identified demjanjuk 
demjanjuk heard the verdict from a cot in a courthouse cell 
where guards carried him feet first after he complained of a back 
injury defense attorneys said he was in too much pain to sit in 
the courtroom 
in the judgment levine said demjanjuk wasnt an ordinary guard 
but fulfilled a central position at treblinka with his own 
hands he took part in the murders of masses of human beings 
showing initiative beyond what his superiors demanded of him 
levine said 
treblinka survivors have said ivan would stand near gas 
chambers and strike prisoners with a metal bar or bayonet as they 
went to their deaths 
survivor pinchas epstein was helped from the courtroom in tears 
after judges quoting from his testimony said ivan would gloat at 
the crushed faces the blood flowing after he brutalized people 
levine said the court gave great weight to the testimony of the 
five survivors and rejected defense claims that the witnesses were 
unreliable and suffered memory lapses 
they the witnesses saw him day after day and followed his 
every action with fear afraid they could be one of his victims 
levine said these experiences are deeply ingrained on their 
memories the horrors are a deep part of them 
the court also rejected the defense claim that the 
ukrainianborn demjanjuk was a german prisoner of war in 1942 and 
1943 
the judges upheld a key piece of prosecution evidence 
demjanjuks alleged nazi identity card which the soviet union 
supplied 
the card was issued at trawniki a training camp for death camp 
guards near treblinka it does not mention treblinka but states 
that demjanjuk was posted at the nearby sobibor death camp 
defense attorneys said the card is a soviet forgery to punish 
demjanjuk for fighting in an anticommunist unit the nazis formed 
at the end of world war ii 
but judge daliah dorner said we conclude the personal details 
on the id card are those of the accused 
defense attorney john gill called the trial unfair 
my god in heaven according to those judges we didnt do 
anything right gill told the associated press they ruled 
against us on every single point no matter how big or small 
justice was not done 
this is going to go down in history as the most lopsided case 
ever conducted anywhere in the world added ed nishnic 
demjanjuks soninlaw who raised 650000 for the defense 
jewish leaders praised the verdict 
rabbi marvin hier dean of the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles said in a statement distributed in jerusalem 
there is a bitter sense of irony in that this death camp guard 
determined to kill off any trace of jewish life must now end 
his life in the jewish state watching from the window the 
uninterrupted growth of jewish civilization 
the trial began feb 16 1987 a year after demjanjuk was 
extradited to israel from suburban cleveland he was stripped of 
his us citizenship for lying on his immigration application

investigators probing an engine fire that caused 
a horizon air plane to crash here said monday night the same engine 
emitted a strong fuel odor days before the accident 
the national transportation safety board investigators also said 
a 1987 engine fire in a similar plane forced an emergency landing 
the pilot of the plane that crashed told the investigators that 
a different horizon de havilland dash 8 prop plane he was flying 
about a week before fridays crash at seattletacoma international 
airport lost power briefly in one of its engines ntsb investigator 
joseph t nall said at a news conference 
although the engine immediately regained power pilot carl 
carlson aborted that flight and landed he told the ntsb he 
understood from other pilots that such a problem was not 
uncommon but it was certainly not a regular occurrence nall 
said 
nall did not say where that flight originated and landed 
a june 1987 engine fire aboard a de havilland dash 8 involved 
fuel spilled into the engine cowling and forced the plane which 
had taken off from seatac to make an emergency landing at 
seattles boeing field nall said 
that fire involved maintenanceoriented issues relating to the 
positioning of fuel lines that could be crimped upon closing 
of various access panels nall said 
horizon air changed maintenance procedures after that fire nall 
said adding we dont know at this point if the june 1987 and 
the latest fire are related 
the plane that crashed friday night injuring 19 of the 40 
people aboard as it smashed into a passenger concourse loading 
ramp was one of 10 dash 8s in the horizon fleet 
nall said the investigation will try to determine why there was 
the fuel on the cowling over the right engine before the crash and 
what caused the fuel to ignite nall said the fuel was noticed by 
passengers 
carlson also told investigators of a maintenance log entry a 
week to 10 days before the crash that described a strong fuel odor 
coming from the same engine that caught fire nall said 
there was some maintenance done and nobody complained of the 
smell after the april 8 report nall said 
horizon air president john kelly said earlier monday that 
airline crews checked engines on the companys dash8s but found no 
problems that would lead to a fire the checks were not related to 
the official investigation into the crash he added 
the mangled plane probably will be moved tuesday to a hangar 
where the right turboprop engine will be removed said ntsb 
spokesman ted lopatkiewicz the engine will be sent to the 
manufacturer pratt amp whitney canada in montreal and taken apart 
under ntsb supervision he said 
lopatkiewicz said investigators still did not know why the plane 
veered off a runway and headed toward the terminal after it touched 
down 
carlson and copilot mark hilstad told ntsb investigators sunday 
in portland ore that they applied full force to the brakes and 
locked the emergency brake but could not avoid ramming the 
passenger ramp they also said they pushed hard on the right rudder 
in an effort to steer the aircraft 
the pilots comments during a closeddoor meeting were overheard 
by reporters outside 
the pilots said the fire erupted so quickly they had little time 
to make an emergency landing they said they realized they were 
going too fast and appeared to be coming down too high to 
adequately slow down but had no choice except to land 
three of the injured passengers remained hospitalized monday 
including brian malcolm 26 of clarkston who was in serious but 
stable condition

former ambassador to the united nations jeane 
kirkpatrick said the united states may not have been justified in 
this weeks attack on iran 
i wish i knew whether that mine was aimed at us and not just 
there kirkpatrick said at a news conference monday before 
addressing members of the central bancorporation inc 
obviously we dont want the persian gulf to be mined 
but i think the confrontation is dangerous and its not in 
the interest of anybody she said 
us forces on monday destroyed two of irans persian gulf oil 
platforms sank or damaged four attack boats and disabled two 
frigates 
the attack was in retaliation for an incident last week in which 
a us ship was damaged by a mine injuring 10 crewmembers 
kirkpatrick who said she was a little disturbed by current 
events did say the us should maintain a presence in the area 
obviously the united states has a role an interest in the 
persian gulf she said but i personally think we should have 
kept a lower profile to send not 17 ships but three its very 
important to have a us presence in the gulf 
kirkpatrick said she did not think the united states would go to 
war with iran because of the implications of a declared war 
and because so many of our good friends sell arms to iran 
she also said the united states would not declare war on iran 
so we can back off and pull out later 
kirkpatrick also downplayed speculation that she may be 
considered as a vicepresidential candidate on the republican 
ticket 
i think that its a very bad job she said of the vice 
presidency no serious person would really want it

this city on the upswing is using its 
350th birthday to celebrate its successes and find new ways to deal 
with the urban ills that provide a constant reminder of its 
failings 
but not everyone believes there is reason to celebrate 
critics point to the grim statistics that often dominate 
descriptions of new haven a high poverty rate that makes it one of 
the nations poorest cities blighted neighborhoods the large 
number of drugrelated aids cases 
but the organizers of new haven 350 say that despite the 
problems a celebration is in order for this selfproclaimed 
cultural capital of connecticut which has enjoyed a 
multimilliondollar revitalization in recent years and is home to 
yale university 
we feel the city has turned the corner and is moving in a very 
positive direction said rob schwartz a yalenew haven hospital 
official who is one of the cochairmen of the birthday celebration 
the people of new haven have reason to be proud of what we 
have achieved to date said schwartz 
three major events are scheduled to celebrate the birthday a 
city fair june 4 and 5 a giant fireworks show july 4 and series 
of town meetings sometime this fall 
while the first two events are intended to showcase the citys 
achievements and demonstrate its worthiness as a tourist 
attraction the town meetings will be used to mobilize the entire 
community for problemsolving 
yale and other major institutions and businesses are helping to 
fund the events this sunday mayor biagio dilieto and the dean of 
yales drama school will narrate a history of the city during a 
concert that also will mark the first public performance of a score 
composed in honor of new havens birthday by a yale professor 
i recognize of course some people might question the need 
for a celebration given the many serious human and social problems 
we have dilieto said in a recent interview but i believe a 
birthday celebration is uplifting to the spirt of the people 
only those who have witnessed the changes over the last decade 
in this city of 126000 people can appreciate the amount of 
progress that has been made said dilieto 
the downtown has undergone a transformation that amounts to 
nothing less than a renaissance according to the mayor 
and the work continues 
in addition to new shops officials say more than 1 million 
square feet of office space is under construction or proposed for 
the next five years as developers gamble the resurgence will 
continue and new companies will be lured to the long island sound 
port founded by the puritans in 1638 
but critics say much of what the city has done is merely 
cosmetic and that the main beneficiaries of the downtown 
redevelopment have been developers not the people who make new 
haven according to the 1980 census the seventh poorest city in 
the nation 
they are fixing up the downtown but they are doing nothing in 
the black community said haywood hooks jr a research chemist 
who is president of the greater new haven chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
unfortunately i dont think it is time for blacks to 
celebrate he said blacks comprise more than 30 percent of the 
population 
dilieto who has been in office since 1980 said his 
administration has demonstrated a commitment to the neighborhoods 
as well as the downtown the city has created more than 3000 
housing units for mostly low and middleincome people and has 
provided loans and grants as well as accompanying public 
improvements for property owners who wish to make their own 
improvements he said 
karl hilgert executive director of christian community action 
a provider of emergency services and advocate for the poor and 
homeless said the administration clearly has made efforts to 
help the disadvantaged but that the concern for economic 
development needs to be geared more to jobs that get people above 
the poverty level

supporters of retired autoworker john demjanjuk 
were outraged that israeli judges convicted him as the nazi death 
camp guard ivan the terrible and said the decision will rouse 
antisemitism in america 
demjanjuk a ukrainian immigrant to the cleveland suburb of 
seven hills was convicted monday in israel of war crimes in 
connection with the deaths of 850000 jews at the treblinka death 
camp in nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
peter jacyk a toronto resident of ukrainian descent who helped 
raise money for demjanjuk said monday the effect the verdict has 
on the world view of the jewish community will be similar to the 
crucifixion of jesus christ 
i think people will be outraged because they know demjanjuk is 
innocent jacyk said in the long run it will have a very 
negative effect on israel and jews it will definitely be 
longremembered 
demjanjuk who could be sentenced to death or life imprisonment 
when the court reconvenes april 25 has gotten some of his 
strongest backing from cleveland area residents of ukrainian 
descent more than 200 people gathered sunday at st vladimirs 
cathedral in parma a ukrainian orthodox church to pray for 
demjanjuk 68 and his family 
it the conviction is bound to have a negative effect on the 
american populations view of israel said bill liscynesky of 
parma who heads the clevelandarea united ukrainian organizations 
the majority of americans feel that demjanjuk is innocent 
liscynesky said telephones are probably very hot spreading 
the word among local ukrainians about demjanjuks conviction he 
said his coalition has about 20000 active members there are an 
estimated 2 million people of ukrainian descent in the united 
states 
i understand very well why they ukrainians are hurting very 
badly said martin j plax cleveland director of the american 
jewish committee its like when someone gets cut and you yell 
ouch and you start cursing thats what theyre doing right now 
in time i suspect the dust will settle and well get back to doing 
things to bring the two communities together 
plax said he was profoundly shocked by the sternness of the 
judges verdict but a former cleveland lawyer who helped win 
demjanjuks extradition to israel in 1986 said the conviction 
didnt surrprise him 
i think there was no doubt that he was given a fair trial 
that every possible defense was raised and thoroughly defended 
said alvin lodish a former justice department lawyer who practices 
in miami there can be no doubt who john demjanjuk really is 
abraham h foxman national director of the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith hailed the conviction of demjanjuk as 
gratifying evidence that even 40 years after the holocaust 
justice can prevail over evil 
foxman said the yearlong trial reflected israels commitment 
to the democratic rule of law 
in albany ny deborah rausch who attended the trial said on 
behalf of her local chapter of holocaust survivors and friends in 
pursuit of justice we commend the state of israel for accepting 
this reponsibility and we hope they will continue to prosecute nazi 
war criminals who have found haven throughout the world 
elizabeth holtzman a new york city prosecutor who formerly 
sponsored legislation in congress to allow for deportation of nazi 
war criminals said the conviction sends the world a signal that 
nazi war criminals cannot escape

mark oconnor defended john demjanjuk 
because he was convinced the retired autoworker couldnt be the 
nazi death camp guard who savagely beat jews on the way to the gas 
chamber 
demjanjuk was a gentle old man whod bounce oconnors 
3yearold daughter on his knee smiling and talking nonsense 
oconnor a buffalo lawyer who specialized in immigration law 
moved to jerusalem to defend the 68yearold ukrainian who lived in 
a cleveland suburb oconnor had insisted it was a case of mistaken 
identity and warned that an innocent man should not be punished 
because of a desire for revenge 
that was five years ago today oconnor is pondering the man he 
thought he knew the man who was convicted monday in israel of 
being the sadistic guard known as ivan the terrible 
toward the end i looked at how calmly and cooly he removed me 
from this case after i fought for him for so many years believing 
in him believing in his credibility oconnor said i began to 
wonder whether id made a mistake 
oconnor who was the chief defense attorney until last year 
when he was removed by the israeli court at demjanjuks request 
said the case against his former client was extensive 
the defense depended on creating a reasonable doubt about 
whether demjanjuk was ivan 
oconnor tried to show that documents supplied by the soviet 
union linking demjanjuk to the nazis were forged he also he tried 
to cast doubt on the testimony of witnesses many of whom were old 
and in frail health 
the court however rejected the arguments 
we determine decisively and without hesitation or doubt that 
the accused john demjanjuk who is on trial before us is ivan 
known as ivan the terrible the operator of the gas chambers 
said presiding judge dov levine 
levines summation indicated that the judges gave great weight 
to the testimony of five survivors who identified demjanjuk as the 
ukrainian guard at the treblinka death camp in poland 
the court also noted that demjanjuks testimony was filled 
with inconsistent versions 
oconnor acknowledged that demjanjuks testimony was spotty 
and said he understood how the judges could have conceived of 
demjanjuks memory lapses as incriminating 
he said demjanjuk chose not to prepare for crossexamination 
it was one of the exceptions he took with the court and 
ultimately with his defense oconnor said 
oconnor who was asked to take the case by demjanjuks 
daughter was dismissed because of a dispute with demjanjuks 
family and the ukrainian community that supported him over the 
direction of the case 
they the family didnt understand the culture or country the 
way i did he said of israel to explain why i was using a 
talmudic argument to a religious judge sitting on the bench was 
something that became more and more difficult 
they thought i was projewish he said 
oconnor said he thought it was irrational to attack the 
holocaust survivors who are considered a national resource 
the attorney that replaced oconnor as chief defender yoram 
sheftel changed the tone of the defense trying to discredit the 
prosecutions witnesses 
the tactic may have damaged the defense because it alienated 
public opinion oconnor said 
the whole country was affixed to the trial and there was a 
sense that the judges knew they were deciding for the people he 
said 
showing respect and deference was the only way to keep people 
from viewing demjanjuk as a symbol of past wrongs he said 
despite the emotionally charged atmosphere oconnor thinks 
demjanjuk got a fair trial 
it cant be said that he demjanjuk didnt have every 
opportunity to present evidence he said he couldnt have got 
a fairer trial 
under israeli law demjanjuks case will automatically be 
appealed and will probably be reviewed by the nations supreme 
court 
oconnor said the court would give the case an extensive review 
and offer demjanjuk another chance to cast doubt on whether he is 
ivan the terrible

action and fired chaff into the air which confused the silkworms 
radar guidance system and caused the five missiles to miss the 
convoy in the southern gulf 
the missile attack on monday represented the first reported 
firing of the silkworm batteries along irans coast at ships in the 
southern gulf or the strait of hormuz the waterways narrow

american helicopters in the persian gulf shot down one of them 
monday afternoon 
two groups of us navy warships struck the iranian oil 
platforms sassan and sirrid 100 miles apart in the southern gulf 
on monday morning crews on the platforms were given advance 
warning to evacuate the platforms which have been used as bases 
for speedboat attacks on neutral shipping 
one platform was destroyed by naval gunfire and the other by 
explosives placed on it according to statements in washington 
the iranian news agency said us warships attacked the sassan 
platform first then hit the nasr platform off nearby sirri island 
iranian gunboats then went on a rampage in the southern gulf 
carlucci said a navy helicopter was fired upon during the raid 
on the platforms but not hit iranians shot at a press helicopter 
carrying an nbctv crew and associated press photographer norbert 
schiller but missed 
schiller said the iranians fired at least half a dozen 
50caliber rounds and smallarms fire at the helicopter 
he said part of sirrid collapsed and the platform still was 
burning before sundown sassan was badly damaged but the main 
structure was still standing and the fire was put out by five 
iranian tugboats which also fired at our helicopter schiller 
said 
two iranian warplanes tried to harass a us warship but the 
ship fired missiles and the aircraft fled shipping sources in 
dubai reported 
they said an iranian patrol boat fired at the us cruiser 
wainwright one of the ships attacking sassan and sirrid but did 
not hit it the frigate simpson returned fire and sank the iranian 
boat the sources added 
in late afternoon the 310foot iranian frigate sahand 
confronted three us warships in the strait of hormuz ignoring 
repeated warnings the sahand fired at three a6 intruder aircraft 
near the aircraft carrier uss enterprise 
the uss strauss hit the sahand with a harpoon missile that left 
the iranian ship ablaze according to pentagon reports 
pentagon officials said the iranian frigate sabalan fired on an 
a6 and the plane attacked hitting the ship with a laserguided 
bomb

field off the emirate of sharjah in the southern gulf targeting 
the scanbay drilling rig the 112744ton british tanker york 
marine and a storage facility shipping executives reported

four siblings brutally stabbed to 
death in their home were buried sidebyside as family members 
called for a reform of a judicial system they partly blamed for the 
deaths 
more than 1000 mourners filed past the caskets of jennifer 
mann 19 shannon mann 17 martha mann 15 and ernest mann 11 
before their burial monday 
the four were killed early friday when an assailant broke into 
their mobile home and attacked them with steak knives some of 
which broke in their bodies because of the strength of the blows 
authorities have said 
the parents ernest and rebecca mann who are separated and were 
not home at the time of the attack had to be supported physically 
by relatives as they walked to the burial site 
shannon manns 20yearold former boyfriend leo narvaiz jr 
who was arrested shortly after the attack remained in jail today 
under 405 million bond on four capital murder charges and a 
charge of criminal mischief 
grady mann jr an uncle of the victims told reporters before 
the memorial service that the judicial system was flawed because 
police did not arrest narvaiz quickly enough in connection with an 
earlier threat against the children and their friends 
although ernest and rebecca mann and their four children 
believed enough in the system to allow the police department and 
the district attorneys office to protect them from threat and 
harm the one fact remains what should have happened did not 
grady mann said 
it is our hope this tragedy might serve as a catalyst for all 
of us nationally to personally protest the system that has 
evolved he said the system protects and shelters the rights 
of the few and in so doing neglects the needs of the many the time 
for change is now lest another family need go through the agony 
and torture of loss whether one or many 
narvaiz was accused of threatening shannon manns current 
boyfriend ricky moore 24 and of damaging moores pickup truck 
during a fight on march 28 
moore had filed a complaint against narvaiz and jennifer and 
shannon moore had given police statements about the incident 
authorities said they were looking for narvaiz before the attack 
occurred 
the friends and family members who attended the memorial service 
walked past four identical closed caskets marked with the victims 
pictures and surrounded by hundreds of roses and pink and blue 
carnations 
the rev daniel m hubbell told mourners he had talked with the 
childrens mother and she wanted more than anything else for the 
young people that are here to understand the hurt and the pain so 
that you too may be prepared for it one day this proves to 
us today that we live in a sinful and murderous world

opponents of new abortion restrictions sued 
in state and federal courts to head off provisions of a 
pennsylvania law before it takes effect next week 
the goal is to block the implementation of the nations most 
restrictive abortion control law barry steinhardt executive 
director of the american civil liberties union of pennsylvania 
said of the lawsuit filed monday 
this law seeks to make an abortion as difficult to obtain as 
possible physically financially and emotionally said susan 
cary nicholas a lawyer for the philadelphiabased womens law 
project 
gov robert p casey is confident the law which he signed march 
25 will stand up in court said his press secretary robert 
grotevant 
we drafted it with the constitution in mind said francis 
viglietta a spokesman for the antiabortion pennsylvania catholic 
conference it will pass the constitutional muster 
the law is scheduled to take effect sunday but steinhardt said 
lawyers would press this week for court injunctions to prevent that 
we have a number of reasons for believing that this law will 
not go into effect as scheduled said steffan presser the state 
aclu legal director 
the suit filed in us district court challenges the laws 
requirement that minors obtain parental or judicial consent before 
abortions the restrictions violate rights of privacy due process 
and freedom of association guaranteed by the us constitution and 
other federal laws the suit says 
it also challenges reporting requirements that would force 
clinics and doctors that provide abortions to supply information to 
the state those provisions could open clinics doctors and women 
seeking abortions to harassment and potentional violence from 
antiabortion activists ms nicholas said 
a companion suit filed in commonwealth court is aimed at a 
provision that would require indigent rape and incest victims to 
report the crimes to lawenforcement agencies before they could 
receive medicaid funding for an abortion 
the suit was filed on behalf of an unidentified medicaid 
recipient who has twice been the victim of rape and was mistreated 
by police when she reported the crime the suit says 
additional plaintiffs include women organized against rape the 
elizabeth blackwell health center and the counseling organization 
choice 
mary beliveau legislative coordinator for the pennsylvania 
prolife federation said the lawsuit seeks to allow the abortion 
industry to keep parents in the dark about the health of their 
children 
it is inconceivable that proabortion groups would challenge 
legislation that provides parents with the right to supervise the 
health care of their minor children she added 
in 1986 the us supreme court struck down key provisions of a 
1982 law those provisions required doctors to make a record that 
could be made public of every abortion they performed required 
doctors to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and 
available benefits for prenatal care and childbirth and required 
the presence of two doctors for abortions performed in the third 
trimester 
in december casey a democrat vetoed an abortion control bill 
that would have required notification of sexual partners or 
parental notification in the case of a minor

contra leaders treated to a heroes return by 
dozens of nicaraguan exiles here expressed satisfaction with the 
progress made during peace talks in managua even though no 
agreement was reached 
we were able to come out of the four days and still keep 
negotiating said adolfo calero one of four nicaraguan 
resistance directors who arrived at miami international airport 
late monday 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and the usbacked 
rebels are scheduled to meet again in the capital of their country 
at the end of the month 
the peace talks that were adjourned monday marked the first time 
in the 6yearold war that the sandinistas have agreed to 
negotiate with their foes in managua 
things are better than they were calero said after the 
singing and cheering died down at the airport 
our major accomplishment has been to sit with the sandinistas 
face to face said director pedro joaquin chamorro adding that 
the climate of the talks was sincere 
in my opinion the sandinistas behaved responsibly chamorro 
said 
but he also said his expectations going into the talks were not 
high and he emphasized that the government needed to institute 
democratic changes 
negotiations have been deadlocked over the socalled 
democratization issue 
the sandinistas have insisted the rebels sign a permanent truce 
immediately they say contra delegates would then be allowed to 
take part in a national reconciliation dialogue with leaders of 
the countrys 14 legally recognized political parties 
contra leaders are demanding that the sandinistas first carry 
out democratic reforms or at least pledge to do so 
the contras and the sandinistas last month signed a peace 
agreement that provided for a temporary ceasefire while they 
negotiated a permanent truce the 60day ceasefire went into 
effect april 1 
in managua on monday the contra leaders visited roman catholic 
officials and editors at la prensa the only opposition newspaper 
and whose publisher is chamorros mother violeta 
his father also named pedro joaquin chamorro was slain jan 
10 1978 in a killing widely blamed on the rightwing government 
in power at the time the slaying helped unleash the revolt that 
toppled president anastasio somoza and swept the sandinistas into 
power in july 1979 
also returning here were alfredo cesar and azucena ferrey 
directors of the nicaraguan resistance an umbrella rebel 
organization based in miami

presentation of the 369000 templeton prize for 
progress in religion has been postponed because of an investigation 
of charges that this years winner helped spread antisemitism a 
newspaper reported today 
inamullah khan of pakistan secretarygeneral of the world 
moslem congress was to have received the award may 10 according 
to an announcement last month by the sponsors of the annual prize 
he was the first moslem to win the award which has been presented 
15 times 
the new york times reported that prize officers have delayed the 
presentation pending an investigation that centers on complaints by 
the american jewish committee and the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith that khan and his organization have fostered 
antisemitism for years 
khan says he has difference with zionists because the un 
general assembly has declared zionism a racist creed but he 
said i can never support antisemitic feelings because i am 
myself a descendant of semitic ancestors from the middle east 
the templeton officers praised khan last month for promoting 
interreligious cooperation and his supporters say he and his 
organization have been more willing than other islamic groups to 
maintain contacts with jews 
but the times reported that the newsletter of the world moslem 
congress while under khans direction published praise of 
antisemitic tracts and accused jews and zionists of controlling 
us politics and media 
the newsletter the moslem world advertised and endorsed the 
protocols of the elders of zion and henry fords the 
international jew two notoriously antisemitic tracts in the 
mid1970s 
past recipients of the templeton prize include mother teresa 
the rev billy graham and alexander i solzhenitsyn 
sir john templeton an americanborn financier living in the 
bahamas established the prize in 1972 as a religious counterpart 
to the nobel prizes for peace science and literature

a lawyer persuaded liberace to sign a 
will he didnt want shortly before his death then began robbing 
liberaces grave by mismanaging hundreds of thousands of dollars 
from the estate an attorney says 
los angeles lawyer joel strote executor of the estate wanted 
liberaces money and even went to the entertainers palm springs 
calif home after his death and declared i am liberace 
attorney harold gewerter charged during opening arguments in a 
civil suit 
but strote testified monday in state district court that 
liberace called him three weeks before his death and asked that the 
will be updated and that longtime manager seymour heller be 
replaced as executor by strote 
he said he did not want to use seymour anymore and asked me if 
i could do it said strote 
strote said the flamboyant entertainer wanted to make sure that 
most of the estate went to a trust to fund the liberace foundation 
for the performing arts which provides scholarships at 22 
colleges the will named strote trustee of the foundation 
outside court heller who is one of the five plaintiffs 
estimated liberaces estate at 20 million about 2 million was 
raised last week in a los angeles auction of liberaces belongings 
gewerter charged monday that strote executed liberaces will 13 
days before the multimillionaires death and the performer had no 
idea what he was signing 
liberace was in such a mental state on jan 22nd that he 
couldnt understand or read independently gewerter said if 
comedian pee wee herman had walked into his room and said he 
wanted to be executor he liberace would have said yes he 
strote goes into that room owning nothing and comes out with a 
bag of goodies 
gewerter said strote has mismanaged hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from the estate and that strote is spending the estates 
money on personal possessions 
the fraud of mr strote doesnt stop with the will gewerter 
said he believed he was the embodiment of liberace he wanted to 
be liberace more important he wanted liberaces money once he 
became trustee he began robbing liberaces grave 
the suit seeks to replace strote as trustee with heller 
liberaces close friend and manager for 36 years and frank 
dibella the late performers accountant it also seeks to remove 
strote as executor of the will 
in his opening remarks strotes attorney john oreilly said 
the plaintiffs were only angry that they did not get more money out 
of the estate and that strote had served well as executor 
strote said liberaces doctor declared him physically and 
mentally fit just before they met to sign the will at the 
entertainers palm springs home jan 22 1987 
he read what i highlighted but i dont think he read every 
word strote said he asked me generally what was the 
importance of each paper 
liberace died feb 5 1987 of complications stemming from aids 
he was 67 
gewerter said liberace had vowed three months earlier to fire 
strote who had served as liberaces attorney on various occasions

the same day an israeli court convicted 
john demjanjuk of war crimes hundreds of jews visited the 
treblinka nazi death camp where 850000 jews perished in the gas 
chambers he helped operate 
as a cantors mournful chant wafted across the vast open field 
covering the camps remains the visitors searched monday among 
thousands of jagged memorial stones for the names of the polish 
towns where the victims had lived 
my parents were killed here my sisters my brothers an 
uncle an aunt were all killed here said jakub silberstein 64 
of israel who was wearing a striped concentration camp inmates 
cap 
all i know is that if i had a gun i would shoot demjanjuk 
with my own hands silberstein a survivor of the buchenwald and 
auschwitz concentration camps said monday 
the court in jerusalem ruled on monday that the ukrainianborn 
demjanjuk a retired ohio autoworker was the notorious guard 
ivan the terrible who helped operate the gas chambers at 
treblinka 
the emotional pilgrimage for hundreds of jews from israel the 
united states and other countries followed observances of the 45th 
anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising 
accompanying the israeli delegation was jacek wilczur an 
official with the polish governments nazi war crimes investigation 
commission who assisted israeli prosecutors in gathering evidence 
for demjanjuks trial 
being here on this day has a symbolic significance he said 
it is not a trial of one demjanjuk that is important its a 
trial of the german system of homicide 
on tuesday the jewish visitors followed the last route of the 
condemned jews of the warsaw ghetto traveling to treblinka after 
dedicating a new memorial at the umschlagplatz the site near the 
railroad siding from which 300000 jews were deported to nazi death 
camps 
traveling by bus they made the 53mile trip to treblinka 
northeast of warsaw in about 1 hours 
fortyfive years ago the cattle cars packed with people 
sometimes took several days to travel the same route 
in 194243 a whole trainload of people could be undressed 
stripped of their belongings and killed in two hours the 13 gas 
chambers could kill 2000 people in 10 to 15 minutes 
the nazis razed the camp to the ground after a bloody prisoners 
revolt on aug 2 1943 and planted trees to hide the traces of 
their crimes which today give the site a strangely serene 
atmosphere 
the polish government is now raising money to build a museum at 
treblinka where there is now only a memorial of stones erected in 
1963 built to resemble a symbolic graveyard 
at the center of the 23acre site is a massive granite column 
resembling a tombstone with a menorah a traditional symbol of 
judaism hewn into one side in front is a stone with the 
inscription in six languages never again 
my feet are planted on this land which has mixed on it the 
ashes of 800000 jews who were brought here said chaika grosman 
a member of the israeli knesset or parliament and survivor of the 
1943 jewish ghetto uprising in the polish city of bialystok 
my nation was destroyed before my eyes and i was helpless 
she said speaking at a memorial rally in front of the monument 
that was attended by about 1000 jews and poles i come here from 
israel as a pilgrim to the graves of my predecessors 
deputy prime minister itzhak navon of israel said the only 
positive answer to the holocaust and treblinka is increasing our 
numbers and strengthening the state of israel 
people walked among the 17000 stones scattered in the field 
surrounding the memorial column 130 of which bear the names of 
polish cities and towns such as biala podlaska and ostrow 
mazowiecki whose jewish inhabitants were transported to treblinka 
other stone markers are inscribed with the names of the 10 
countries from which jews were sent here poland austria 
belgium bulgaria czechoslovakia france greece yugoslavia 
germany and the soviet union 
some of the jewish visitors also prayed by an open pit filled 
with melted black basalt which stands in the place where the nazis 
burned the bodies of their victims 
walking back to the buses on this sunny warm spring day with 
temperatures in the 70s visitors could hear birds singing in the 
fir trees surrounding the field of stones which evoke such 
terrible memories

highranking government and rebel 
delegations agreed on a 10day suspension of direct peace talks 
after a fourth day of negotiations failed to produce a definitive 
ceasefire pact 
also monday president daniel ortega warned that sandinista 
troops would continue fighting the usbacked rebel forces if 
rebel negotiators bowed to pressure from their top military 
commander not to sign an accord 
a joint communique issued at the end of mondays talks said the 
government and the contras as the rebels are known would next 
meet in managua april 2830 to continue negotiations to end their 
6yearold civil war 
the statement described talks between sandinista officials and 
leaders of the contras nicaraguan resistance organization as 
frank and cordial and said the two sides had entered into 
permanent session to reach an accord 
contra leader pedro joaquin chamorro told reporters that 
government and rebel officials had agreed that at any moment we 
can renew the negotiations to give continuity to this process 
we are certain the negotiations will end in success said 
nicaraguan defense minister humberto ortega who headed the 
governments negotiating team 
president ortega the defense ministers brother charged that 
col enrique bermudez the contra military commander and the 
united states were pressuring rebel negotiators to avoid a 
ceasefire agreement 
according to ortega bermudez threatened the resistance 
directorate saying rebel military forces would liquidate them 
if they signed an agreement with the government 
if this happens it would leave us no other road but to 
achieve a total victory in the military field ortega told 
thousands of government supporters gathered in managuas plaza de 
la revolucion on monday evening 
alfredo cesar and adolfo calero leaders of the resistance 
directorate denied ortegas claim the directorates six members 
arrived in managua on friday for the first time since the civil war 
began in november 1981 they left the country monday evening 
officials from both sides declined to provide details on the 
latest round of talks humberto ortega said they were an advance 
and not a failure while calero the highestranking resistance 
official told reporters that both sides were on the road to an 
understanding 
negotiations reportedly stalled over the issue of when the 
sandinistas would introduce democratic reforms in nicaragua 
arriving in miami on monday night calero said that would be the 
top issue when talks resume 
the sandinistas insist the rebels sign a permanent truce 
immediately they say contra delegates would then be allowed to 
take part in a national reconciliation dialogue with leaders of 
nicaraguas 14 legally recognized political parties 
contra leaders demand the sandinistas first carry out a series 
of democratic reforms or at least pledge to do so before they 
will sign a pact 
the two sides signed a provisional agreement on march 23 which 
provided for a temporary ceasefire while they negotiated a 
permanent truce a 60day ceasefire went into effect april 1 
the contras on monday proposed that the temporary ceasefire be 
extended another month while both sides seek agreement there was 
no immediate government response

some panamanian and foreign banks 
opened for the first time in 45 days but only to accept deposits 
one banker said the opening simply created the appearance that 
panamas financial system can recover 
business was brisk on monday at a few major foreign banks but 
slow at institutions owned and operated by panamanians 
the panama banking commission ordered the reopening as a first 
step in the resumption of full banking services banks closed march 
3 after a run on deposits prompted by the ouster of president eric 
arturo delvalle which was orchestrated by strongman gen antonio 
manuel noriega 
panamanians have been unable to cash paychecks or gain access to 
checking accounts since the closing and have conducted business on 
a cashonly basis 
the manager of a foreign bank speaking on condition his name 
not be used said that mondays limited reopening gives the 
illusion that things are becoming normal i dont know whether it 
will work or not 
he said the move would allow circulation of checks 
reestablish the check as an acceptable payment in panama 
he noted however that clients depositing checks still would 
not be able to draw cash from their accounts unless the banks 
resume full services 
but if you owe money to someone and he will accept a check 
you can write a check on your new balance he said 
even such a transaction would be guaranteed only if the partial 
reopening works as envisioned under a complex set of rules issued 
by the banking commission bankers said customers who made deposits 
monday should know by next week if the checks cleared and have been 
credited to their accounts 
some financial sources predicted the new system wouldnt work as 
long as panamas cash crunch continues and the government fails to 
resolve the political crisis that prompted the collapse of the 
banking system 
the panamanian banking association which represents most of the 
more than 120 banks doing business in panama has said repeatedly 
that its members will not resume full service until the government 
can assure a steady adequate supply of us dollars which panama 
uses as its official currency 
panamanians began withdrawing large sums of money begining feb 
26 the day noriega orchestrated the dismissal of delvalle for 
trying to fire him as chief of the armed forces and police noriega 
is the head of the 15000strong defense forces and the power 
behind the civilian government 
in retaliation the reagan administration ordered economic 
sanctions that included the freezing of panamanian accounts in us 
banks and withholding revenues from panama canal toll fees 
noriega is under federal indictment in florida on drug 
trafficking charges and the united states recognizes delvalle as 
panamas legitimate president 
word of mondays partial bank reopening had been announced in 
newspapers through the weekend 
about 30 people lined up outside the local office of chase 
manhattan bank before opening time monday and another 10 were 
outside the citibank branch panamas private and government banks 
their solvency in question appeared to be doing far less business 
except for the few who came with cash customers said they were 
depositing checks they had accumulated since march 3 
some customers expressed optimism that the limited reopening 
might lead to the return of normal banking services in panama 
theyre trying something new said frank farrell a former 
chase manhattan employee who was depositing checks there i dont 
know if itll work it might well give it a try 
but farrell like most others was being cautious ill keep my 
cash at home later on maybe ill deposit cash 
a middleaged panamanian woman in the same line said she also 
was depositing only checks i need the cash to eat she said

after thieves cut a banks alarm system and drilled a hole through 
a concrete floor into the vault police say 
everything of value contained in the boxes at the liberty bank 
and trust co in downtown boston was stolen over the weekend

wouldnt comment but the globe quoted police sources as saying the 
robbery was believed to have occurred over several hours sunday

a dropped ceiling were pushed out and alarm wires behind them 
apparently were cut and a bypass wire slipped into place 
the thieves entered an unlocked and empty secondfloor vault

a meeting with penn state university 
president bryce jordan and his top administrators represents only 
the first step for improving life for blacks at the school says a 
black student leader 
i think the students are aware that this is just a beginning 
and whats going to be needed is further organization further 
commitment and further negotiations said robert blair a 
spokesman for the black caucus a student organization 
before the meeting jordan announced he would withdraw 
trespassing charges and the threat of university sanctions against 
89 students arrested for a 15hour sitin that ended april 9 
blair and nine other black student leaders negotiated with 
jordan and four senior administrators for five hours monday on 
minority issues ranging from financial aid for blacks to creating a 
vice president for minority affairs 
i think we made some progress jordan said there were 
some things we had to say no to there were some things we could 
say yes to and some things we had to look at 
jordan agreed to create a vice president for minority affairs 
and also agreed in principle to work toward a goal of 8 percent 
black student enrollment and faculty membership 
last fall penn state failed to reach a courtmandated goal of 5 
percent black enrollment 
of the schools 67000 students a total of 2424 or 36 
percent are black penn state has 57 black faculty members or 16 
percent of its 4100 instructors 
jordan said he couldnt commit the university to more financial 
aid for blacks 
we think your arguments make good sense we simply are not 
going to make budget decisions in this setting he said 
before the negotiations began jordan granted amnesty to the 
protesters 
more than 150 students occupied the telecommunications building 
april 8 after jordan canceled a meeting with student activists 
because ground rules could not be reached in advance 
jordan had sent two administrators to meet with student leaders 
behind closed doors but the students demanded an open meeting 
students still in the building at dawn the next day were charged 
with trespassing and faced university sanctions including possible 
dismissal

many police officers in the azerbaijan city of 
sumgait are being replaced because they were incapable of dealing 
with ethnic rioting that claimed the lives of at least 32 people 
an official said 
nikolai demidov deputy minister of internal affairs said in an 
interview monday on the vremya television news program that younger 
people many of whom recently served in the army were replacing 
the policemen he did not say how many officers were being removed 
riots broke out in sumgait on feb 28 and continued for three 
days as armenian demonstrators demanded annexation to soviet 
armenia of nagornokarabakh which is part of the neighboring 
azerbaijan republic about threequarters of the residents of 
nagornokarabackh are armenians 
soviet officials rejected the annexation demand but promised a 
program to improve cultural and economic development in the area 
demidov said unfortunately many sumgait policemen were not 
up to the extreme conditions during the rioting 
he did not elaborate but balanced his criticism with praise 
citing a police col filipov who he said blocked a mob from 
attacking a bus 
soldiers and internal security forces sent to sumgait to quell 
the violence succeeded without firing their weapons he said 
demidov said the death toll of 32 was correct and repeated the 
government and communist party claims the rioting was instigated by 
criminal elements

chinese authorities do not plan to reopen tibet 
to the thousands of backpackers who streamed through before 
proindependence protests began last year a us official said 
the thrust of the message is tibet is open and they intend to 
keep it open but they intend to keep it travel in groups said 
j stapleton roy deputy assistant secretary of state on monday 
roy said that in talks with authorities during a fourday visit 
to tibet they did not rule out the possibility of further 
unrest in the regions capital lhasa 
he said he carried no message from the us government but 
expressed concern for human rights in tibet and pressed authorities 
to allow more journalists and us congressmen to visit 
roy said he did not discuss chinese conditions for the return of 
the dalai lama tibets spiritual and former political leader who 
fled to india in 1959 
individual travel into tibet officially was halted shortly after 
three protests in september and october by buddhist monks and 
others opposed to chinese rule 
enforcement of the provision that all tourists to tibet join 
guided tour groups slackened early this year but has tightened 
since a protest march 5 in which at least five people died 
chinese authorities alleged after the protests in september and 
october that some foreigners joined in or encouraged participants 
in 1987 43500 foreigners visited tibet spending 15 million 
according to official figures many arrived individually from 
chengdu in southwest china or overland from nepal which borders 
tibet 
roy said authorities told him future travelers would be required 
to travel in groups charging at least 27 per day for expenses 
such a restriction probably will discourage travel by youthful 
backpackers on tight budgets who in the past often spent one or two 
months at a time in lhasa mingling with tibetans without close 
official supervision 
he said there were at most a handful of foreigners in lhasa 
while he was there wednesday through sunday the westernmanaged 
lhasa hotel with 476 rooms has had only about two dozen guests at 
a time since the protests began he said 
nevertheless roy said local authorities claimed tourism had 
increased 133 percent in the first quarter of 1988 with 1184 
visitors 
roy said lhasa was not heavily patrolled by armed police and he 
encountered no roadblocks the general impression is one of 
surface normality but you didnt have to dig deep to find views 
that there was potential for future problems he said 
roy said that when he raised the issue of us concern over 
reported human rights violations in tibet the response was that 
we and the chinese have differing views on the human rights 
question 
china has denounced any criticism of its human rights policy as 
interference in its internal affairs it acknowledges holding some 
political prisoners in tibet but denies charges they are 
mistreated or that religious rights are not respected 
roy said authorities responded positively to his request that 
more us congressmen be allowed to visit tibet four visited lhasa 
on april 7 
he said officials told him journalists were allowed to visit if 
they apply for permission in practice almost all reporters 
requests to visit lhasa have been denied since last years 
protests when 14 foreign journalists were expelled from tibet 
chinese communist troops entered tibet in 1950 ending a 
theocracy headed by the dalai lama

are free haden said

jesse jacksons popularity in the democratic 
presidential primaries hasnt translated into a single vote from 
the party delegates in the us senate 
pose the question why to a democratic member of that 
allwhite group and youll get a look as though you asked why it 
doesnt snow here in july 
its not group racism lawmakers and analysts say its 
practical politics 
a member of congress has to look at it and see whats in it 
for him says charles cook a columnist and observer of internal 
congressional politics 
senate democrats send 43 delegates to the partys national 
convention in atlanta they are among the socalled super 
delegates who serve by virtue of their positions as party leaders 
or elected officials 
of the 32 delegates picked in the senate so far michael dukakis 
has nine sen albert gore has five sen paul simon who 
mothballed his campaign has two and 16 are uncommitted 
although jackson is second in the overall delegate race to 
dukakis he has zero it can be a sensitive topic 
incumbent senators take a hardnosed view of jacksons chances 
of actually becoming president backing a losing ticket would be of 
no help to their own reelection chances or for the democrats 
retaining control of the senate 
theres a strong feeling that weve got to elect a 
president said sen max baucus dmont who is committed to 
dukakis 
we need to do all we can to come up with the best possible 
slate said sen jeff bingaman dnm hes uncommitted but says 
dukakis has certainly shown he has support that has to be a 
major factor 
thomas mann who studies government at the brookings 
institution says some senators may have concluded that jackson 
has the capacity to excite blocs of voters in primaries but hed 
have an extremely difficult time being elected in a general 
election 
i think youd find any number of members of the house and 
senate embrace another black candidate mann said mentioning as 
an example an elected public official such as rep william h gray 
iii dpa gray is supporting jackson 
sen wyche fowler dga who beat a republican incumbent two 
years ago with the help of strong black support is among the 
uncommitted 
i havent sensed any racial prejudice fowler said 
pointing out the large number of uncommitteds the whole concept 
of super delegates is if the public has not made up their minds 
then we come into play he said 
i think most senators want this situation to go away its a 
choice they dont want to make said cook 
its a choice between the people you want to keep in your camp 
and the people you need to get in your camp to win the jewish 
community was very much alienated by jacksons remarks in the 
past 
mann said the senators are caught both ways 
they could be hurt politically by being prominently associated 
with any kind of a stop jackson movement he said 
the hope for senators is that the public will make a candidate 
the inevitable nominee soon so the super delegates can simply 
ratify the popular choice 
with few primaries left a big win for dukakis in todays new 
york contest could lead many senators to conclude that the public 
choice has been made 
i think if dukakis manages to win the political conditions 
will be created for the vast bulk of super delegates to end up in 
the dukakis camp in time for a firstballot victory said mann 
if he wins the primary by a significant margin its all 
over said baucus 
what if jackson surprises dukakis in new york 
theyre going to keep their powder dry certainly until the 
convention mann said

the governmentcontrolled media has barely 
mentioned that cardinal john oconnor of new york is visiting cuba 
oconnor the highestranking us roman catholic leader to 
visit cuba in 29 years said before leaving for the caribbean 
nation on monday night that he hoped the trip would bring cubans 
closer to god 
i ask that you remember me in your prayers that my trip to 
cuba may bring our brothers and sisters there closer to christ and 
his blessed mother he said monday in a written statement in the 
dominican republic the archdiocese of new york provided reporters 
with copies of the statement 
oconnor spent two days in the dominican republic and plans to 
arrive in havana today after spending the night in the city of 
santiago cuba 
there has been no mention of the cardinals trip in the official 
communist party daily granma a fourparagraph story appeared 
sunday in juventud rebelde rebel youth the newspaper of the 
young communist league 
oconnor was invited to cuba by the countrys bishops to 
commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the rev felix 
varela a cuban priest who spent many years in new york and became 
vicar general of the archdiocese 
cuban leader fidel castro who came to power in 1959 and 
established a communist government recently has eased restrictions 
on religious activities in the caribbean nation 
there was no word on whether oconnor would get to talk to 
castro during his fourday visit 
earlier monday oconnor addressed an aids conference in the 
dominican republic with a plea that victims of the incurable 
disease be treated with compassion and dignity 
we have 17 catholic hospitals in the archdiocese of new 
york the roman catholic prelate said i have personally urged 
that any person coming to any one of these hospitals seeking 
assistance because of the possibility of aids be treated with 
absolute total and unconditional dignity 
i spend many nights in one of those hospitals st clares 
visiting aids patients he said often i empty their bedpans 
comb their hair or mop their brow i have realized more and more 
that every single one is a sacred human person made in the image 
and likeness of almighty god 
following his address at catholic university in santo domingo 
the 68yearold oconnor flew by private plane to cuba 
cuban archbishop jaime ortega said in a newsletter made 
available monday that oconnors visit underlines the brotherly 
relations between roman catholic churches in cuba and united states 
to worshipers he said there is no such thing as one church 
being more influential or powerful than another these 
adjectives have been taken from the language of international 
politics and translated without thought sometimes to church 
relations ortega said 
catholics account for 41 percent of cubas 102 million people 
as compared with 92 percent of the dominican republics 66 million 
people

ethiopia said un aid workers can 
resume drought relief operations in the wartorn north but that 
more than 50 other western workers remain barred from the region 
an official said today 
the policy reversal which affects only four of 60 western 
relief workers came after a un envoy met during the weekend with 
president mengistu haile mariam and the nations highest relief 
official berhanu jembere 
undersecretary martti ahtisaari of finland was sent to ethiopia 
to discuss the april 6 expulsions which have crippled a massive 
emergency program to feed 32 million starving people in the 
northern provinces of eritrea and tigre 
tafari wossen information officer of the government relief and 
rehabilitation commission said un officials are definitely 
strengthening their operation there 
in a telephone interview wossen quoted berhanu as saying the 
united nations was never really included in the pullout of aid 
workers and that it must have been a misunderstanding 
but the four un employees were among 60 foreign aid workers 
the marxist government ordered out of eritrea and tigre 
in an interview with the associated press last week berhanu 
insisted his government would not allow even a skeleton staff of 
un or other western aid workers to moitor food distribution in 
the north 
two of the expelled un workers returned today to the eritrean 
capital of asmara with ahtisaari who also is to visit mekelle the 
tigrean capital 
secessionist rebels of the eritrean peoples liberation front 
claimed on monday they had killed 300 government troops and 
captured or wounded 500 more on sunday and monday in a big battle 
20 miles northeast of asmara 
un officials in addis ababa said they could not immediately 
comment on the government concession and its efects on the northern 
relief operation 
the government said it was evacuating the foreigners to avoid 
personnel risks but relief officials and western diplomats 
accused ethiopian officials of jeopardizing lives of millions of 
drought victims and said they believed the government wanted to 
remove witnesses from the war zone as it prepares for a massive 
offensive against rebels 
eritrea a former italian colony on the red sea was 
administered by britain from world war ii until 1952 when it was 
federated with ethiopia under a un resolution rebel groups have 
been fighting for independence since ethiopia incorporated it in 
1962

richard nixon says incidents like the violence 
in the persian gulf strengthen the presidential candidacy of george 
bush because when the united states is attacked the american people 
rally around the administration 
i dont think george bush is going to make a political issue 
out of this the former president said monday in an interview 
with cnn but he said democratic contender michael dukakis ought 
to join in making it clear to the iranians they are confronting a 
united united states on this issue and that were not going to be 
divided 
nixon also said president reagan should make it clear to the 
soviets that the gulf is an area we consider absolutely vital and 
that eventually they are going to hurt their relations with us 
unless they join us in trying to get this war brought to an end 
he described the iraniraq conflict as not a war that we want 
either side to win and added there has never been a war in 
which both sides deserved to lose more than this war

a court today convicted abbas 
hamadi and sentenced him to 13 years in prison for helping abduct 
two west germans in beirut in hopes of forcing the bonn government 
to free his brother twa hijacking suspect mohammed hamadi 
the 29yearold defendant looked dejected after hearing the 
sentence and slumped into his chair he made no comment 
presiding judge klaus arend said abbas hamadi was guilty of the 
charges of kidnapping coercion and possession of explosives 
alfred schmidt one of two west germans kidnapped in the week 
after mohammed hamadis arrest has been freed arend appealed for 
the release of the second businessman rudolf cordes who has been 
held since jan 17 1987 
free rudolf cordes and show the world your own humanity the 
judge said 
he condemned terrorism saying terrorists work to bend other 
people to their will 
arend said that after mohammed hamadis arrest at frankfurt 
airport in january 1987 abbas hamadi talked by telephone with 
people in the lebanese capital including another brother abdul 
hadi hamadi 
after the capture of mohammed hamadi these men formed a circle 
in beirut who decided to do something to block the possible 
extradition to the united states of mohammed hamadi arend said 
in testimony at the trial west german police said they had 
monitored telephone calls made by abbas hamadi who has lived in 
west germany for several years 
abdul hadi hamadi is beirut security chief of hezbollah a 
radical proiranian shiite moselm group that is believed to be an 
umbrella for the groups holding 22 foreign hostages in lebanon 
the 13year prison sentence came as a surprise because 
prosecutors had asked only for a sentence of 11 years 
throughout the trial that began jan 5 abbas hamadi denied 
having anything to do with the kidnappings 
prosecutors said hamadi participated in the abductions in an 
attempt to force the west german government to release mohammed 
hamadi who is being held on charges stemming from the 1985 
hijacking of a twa jetliner to beirut a us navy diver was killed 
and 39 americans were held hostage for 17 days in the hijacking 
defense attorney ludwig hoeller told the court last week that 
abbas hamadi did not contest the explosives charges against him and 
recommended that he be sentenced to one year in prison but hoeller 
said his client should be freed because he had served more than a 
year in investigative custody 
federal agents testified during the trial that abbas hamadis 
fingerprints were found on a letter schmidt wrote to his mother 
while he was being held hostage 
federal prosecutor karlheinz schnarr said in his closing 
arguments that evidence did not link abbas hamadi directly to the 
gunmen who abducted the germans but he said the defendant played a 
role after the kidnappings 
mohammed hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 
1987 while carrying liquid explosives abbas hamadi was arrested in 
frankfurt on jan 26 1987 
mohammed hamadi was charged in february with murder hijacking 
hostagetaking and other crimes connected to the twa hijacking 
after his arrest abbas hamadi admitted helping his brother hide 
liquid explosives near abbas hamadis home in saarland state 
the coercion charge against abbas hamadi stemmed from his 
attempt to force the west german government to reject a us 
extradition request for his brother west germany denied the 
request last year but promised that mohammed hamadi would be put 
on trial in west germany 
last week a frankfurt state court said a juvenile court would 
hear mohammed hamadis case because he may have been under age 21 
when the hijacking was being planned the juvenile court could 
still decide to try mohammed as an adult

the prime minister today called 
parliamentary elections to resolve a political crisis over the 
countrys ban on peacetime nuclear weapons 
prime minister poul schlueter said a more strictly enforced ban 
which the leftist opposition approved last week goes beyond the 
limit where denmarks full membership in nato is put in danger 
britain and the united states fellow members of the military 
alliance have criticized the tighter ban britain has threatened 
to forgo nato maneuvers in denmark 
schlueter who heads a governing centerright coalition called 
the elections for may 10 
in the latest elections in september his fourparty coalition 
lost seven seats to control 70 of the parliaments 179 members it 
has kept enough support on economic issues to command a majority 
but lost 23 votes on defense issues since schlueter took office in 
1982 
the oppositions new policy requires the government to notify 
visiting warships that nuclear weapons are banned in danish ports 
until now denmark has simply announced a general policy and 
assumed individual foreign vessels were observing it 
defense minister bernt johan collet has said the reinforced ban 
would be put in abeyance until after the election 
the new ban fell short of measures adopted by new zealand 
demanding that ship captains affirm their vessels have no nuclear 
weapons that policy prompted the united states to break off 
military cooperation with the south pacific nation 
schlueter said today britain had vowed to bow out of military 
maneuvers to practice reinforcing denmark in wartime because it 
would have to disclose whether its ships carried nuclear weapons 
us secretary of state george shultz said friday the us 
government was deeply distressed with the new danish ban he 
said the us policy of never disclosing the presence of nuclear 
weapons is central to the us ability to fulfill its nato 
commitments we are not going to change it 
nato secretary general lord carrington also said the danish 
action could have extremely serious consequences for the 
16nation alliance

a flaming engine blamed for the crashlanding of 
a horizon air turboprop last week had emitted a strong odor of fuel 
before an earlier flight an investigator said 
national transportation safety board member joseph t nall 
heading the investigation of fridays accident here also discussed 
other engine problems suffered by de havilland dash8s at a news 
conference monday night 
the crashlanding injured 19 of the 40 people aboard as it 
smashed into a passenger ramp at seattletacome international 
airport the plane was one of 10 dash8s in the horizon fleet 
pilot carl carlson also told investigators of a maintenance log 
entry april 8 a week before friday nights crash that described a 
strong fuel odor coming from the same engine that caught fire 
friday night nall said 
there was some maintenance done and nobody complained of the 
smell after the april 8 report nall said 
nall noted that in 1987 an engine fire in a horizon air de 
havilland dash8 had forced an emergency landing 
and nall said that carlson told ntsb investigators that a 
different dash8 turboprop he was flying earlier this month 
suffered a brief power loss in one of its pratt amp whitney engines 
nall said although the engine immediately regained power 
carlson aborted that flight and landed carlson told the safety 
board he understood from other pilots that such a problem was not 
uncommon but it was certainly not a regular occurrence he said 
the investigation is obviously intense at this point nall 
said 
the june 1987 engine fire aboard involved fuel spilled into the 
engine cowling and forced the plane which had taken off from 
seatac to make an emergency landing at boeing field nall said 
horizon air changed maintenance procedures after that fire nall 
said adding we dont know at this point if the june 87 and 
the latest fire are related 
the direction and focus of the investigation is obviously 
to determine why there was the fuel in the right cowling over the 
engine passengers noted there was fuel there before the crash 
and the cause of the ignition of that fuel nall said 
passengers in the plane that crashed friday told investigators 
they could see fuel accumulated on the right wing 
the dash8 engine is made by pratt amp whitney canada and nall 
said the nstb planned to take a long hard look at all us planes 
with similar engines 
horizon air president john kelly said monday that airline crews 
checked engines on the companys fleet of dash8s but found no 
problems that would have led to a fire like the one that preceded 
friday nights crash 
three of the 19 injured passengers remained hospitalized monday

american evangelist billy graham today praised 
chinese leaders saying they are working to broaden freedom of 
religion in their country 
theres no complacency here that ive found among the 
leaders said graham who is taking his first trip to china 
they admit that there are serious problems in implementing the 
constitutional guarantee of freedom and something must be done 
about it 
the 69yearold evangelist who has taken his religious message 
to more than 60 countries made todays comments to foreign 
reporters in beijing 
graham who has preached while in china and held talks with 
leaders praised the countrys leadership for recognizing 
shortcomings in defending the rights of believers and acknowledging 
that religion can play a role in the moral development of the 
nation 
during the first three decades of communist rule in china 
places of worship were destroyed and believers persecuted religion 
suffered especially during the 196676 ultraleftist cultural 
revolution 
the government now guarantees religious freedom but it allows 
only statesanctioned religious groups and forbids prosyletizing 
chinese religious officials say there are about 4 million 
members of the stateapproved protestant church and more than 3 
million catholics affiliated with the patriotic catholic church 
thousands of unaffiliated believers are also thought to worship at 
home 
graham who on sunday preached to more than 1500 worshipers in 
a beijing protestant church said he felt there was a possibility 
of a very positive turn of events for believers in this country 
i seem to sense here that there is a desire on the part of 
leaders for a moral and spiritual rebirth or rejuvenation 
something to give purpose and meaning to china today 
during his week in beijing graham has met religious leaders 
scholars students and government officials including premier li 
peng 
graham confirmed an official chinese report that quoted li as 
saying that china needs spiritual as well as material development 
to prosper 
graham declined to say whether he discussed with officials the 
issue of christians and other believers who have been imprisoned 
for their religious activities catholics in particular have been 
jailed for defying the government policy of cutting all ties to the 
vatican 
however graham said he was told religious leaders are holding 
discussions on drafting a law on religion and the state this 
would help diminish both official and popular attitudes of 
intolerance and discrimination graham said 
he was to leave beijing today for coastal jiangsu province to 
visit the village where his wife ruth the daughter of 
missionaries was born and spent her youth 
graham was also scheduled to speak at a christian seminary in 
nanking and preach at a church in shanghai he will visit canton 
before leaving china on april 28

contract negotiations between scriptwriters 
and producers broke off again after a meeting with a federal 
mediator and no new talks are scheduled in the sixweekold strike 
each side accused the other of intransigence monday the 
deadlock could affect the networks announcement next month of 
their fall schedules with production of new shows and their pilot 
episodes thrown into question 
the writers guild of america had requested a meeting with the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers which the 
guild struck on march 7 over issues of residual fees from foreign 
markets and hourlong shows sold into syndication 
they had nothing new to offer they said we have no change 
in our position alliance spokesman herb steinberg said of 
mondays meeting they just called the meeting to tell us that i 
dont understand it 
but guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said the alliance 
representing about 200 studios and producers insisted that writers 
accept their final offer from march 6 the day before the 
9000member union struck 
at a time when the industry is at a standstill the guild 
regrets the companies unwillingness to deal seriously with 
writers proposals and to continue to negotiate ms rhoden said 
she said the session presided over by federal mediator leonard 
farrell lasted only 20 minutes 
until writers are willing to discuss the producers final offer 
we saw no reason to continue the meeting or to schedule another 
meeting said steinberg 
producers have said several times that they are standing by 
their final offer the alliance has said its proposal would raise 
writers pay by 50 million over three years even though it would 
reduce residual payments for some onehour tv shows 
writers say their own analysis of the offer shows it would 
result in a loss of more than 378 million for its members 
the strike has caused several television shows such as 
moonlighting la law and the cosby show to fall 
three or four shows shy of a full seaso3ptkwkkkcc

a cafeteria that fired an employee for having 
an extreme hairdo refuses to rehire her despite a formal 
complaint filed by the american civil liberties union 
if her hairstyle is in conformity with our policy then she 
can have her job back said john fountain an attorney for 
mobile alabased morrison inc which fired renee randall april 4 
from its morrison cafeteria in annapolis 
ms randall 19 says she had been told not to return to work 
until she changed her long ponytail cornrow hairstyle 
not only is this policy ridiculous but it is discriminatory 
against blacks stuart comstockgay executive director of the 
maryland aclu chapter said at a news conference monday to announce 
the complaint filed with the federal equal employment opportunity 
commission it ay not be intended to be racism but black girls 
are the only ones who wear this style 
ms randall 19 wears her hair in tightly braided cornrows with 
a ponytail in the back comstockgay said in an interview the 
fallback part is a blackred blackorange there is a slightly 
different hue to it 
fountain said by telephone that the company objects to the 
ponytail not to ms randalls cornrows 
apparently it was the ponytail that was standing on her head 
about six or eight inches fountain said and the color of the 
hair was different than that of her normal hair which combined to 
make the hairdo extreme 
fountain said another employee in the annapolis store has a 
cornrow hairstyle that is acceptable 
ms randall said she knew of no customers who had complained 
about her hairdo before she was removed from her job she paid for 
the hairstyle and she shouldnt be forced to change it to please 
her employer she said 
she certainly wants her job back and were going to try to 
convince morrisons cafeteria to give her her job back 
comstockgay said 
ms randall has not talked with morrison management since she 
was told to leave april 4 he said 
morrison inc operates more than 150 cafeterias primarily in 
the south and east fountain said 
comstockgay said if the complaint before the eeoc runs its full 
course it may be six months or longer before a decision is 
rendered i think she may have to look for another job he

democrat michael dukakis trying to end 
confusion over his position on fighting in the persian gulf said 
today the us action against iran was appropriate under the 
circumstances 
the massachusetts governor who was looking for a victory in 
todays presidential primary to propel him toward the nomination 
greeted subway commuters in queens and stopped for a visit at the 
tbone diner before returning to boston 
dukakis made a brief statement to reporters on the persian gulf 
situation but took no questions on the issue during a news 
conference on the steps of the diner on monday he had told one 
reporter he considered the us action a measured response but 
then refused to comment at two news conferences 
based on the facts that i have i think the president took the 
appropriate action he said today it was a measured response 
he said it was a responsibility of the international community 
to do something about the long iraniraq war in the region he 
mentioned an embargo on shipments of arms 
dukakis called the new york campaign a wonderful experience 
i hope i can do well today and win today and i hope i can 
come back as the nominee he said its been a terrific 
exciting interesting couple of weeks and i hope if all goes well 
today a sign of things to come 
dukakis was returning to boston for the day before traveling to 
philadelphias democratic party dinner in the evening an event 
held one week before pennsylvanias presidential primary he 
planned to return to new york to be with supporters when the 
states primary returns are counted tonight 
campaigning back and forth across the state on the eve of new 
yorks primary the democratic frontrunner generally refused to 
speak with reporters about the quickly changing developments in the 
middle east 
but aides confirmed he told one reporter early in the day that 
he considered the us attack on the platforms a measured 
response language considered supportive of the action 
when reporters traveling with him asked for explanations 
dukakis declined to come talk to them on the plane and sent two 
aides to respond instead 
madeleine albright campaign foreign policy adviser said that 
because events were shifting so rapidly he felt he didnt want 
to continue with the initial statement

night dukakis turned away from a reporter who asked about the 
issue dukakis referred the questions to campaign press secretary 
mark gearan who had already told reporters given how the story 
has developed hes withholding comment 
the 11thhour flap came against a backdrop of caution by the 
candidate who could go a long way toward the nomination with a 
victory in new york and following a campaign in which rival albert 
gore jr accused the massachusetts governor of displaying foreign 
policy inexperience 
dukakis urged crowds throughout his final full day of 
campaigning in new york to ignore polls showing him in the lead and 
to help get other supporters out to vote saying turnout would be 
the deciding factor 
i pay no attention to polls and i hope you pay no attention 
to polls he told college students in rochester 
at a lunchtime rally in manhattan dukakis appeared with his 
actress cousin olympia dukakis and spoke optimistically 
here on the eve of the new york primary i just want to say to 
all of you that im grateful for your support grateful for all

the governments planned development of part 
of the six rivers national forest in california does not violate 
indians religious rights the supreme court ruled today by a 53 
vote 
the courts dissenters said the ruling leaves native americans 
with absolutely no constitutional protection from perhaps the 
gravest threat to their religious practices 
the decision revived the federal governments plans to harvest 
timber in one section of the forest and to upgrade a road linking 
the towns of gasquet and orleans 
a federal appeals court had ruled that such development would 
represent a constitutionally impermissible interference with the 
religious rights of three indian tribes 
but writing for the high court today justice sandra day 
oconnor said even if we assume the development will virtually 
destory the indians ability to practice their religion the 
constitution simply does not provide a principle that could justify 
upholding their legal claims 
six rivers encompassing about 956000 acres in northwestern 
california was designated a national forest in 1947 
the portion of the forest involved in the legal dispute is in a 
region between the smith and klamath rivers known as the high 
country it is considered sacred by the yurok karok and tolowa 
tribes 
the us forest service has proposed upgrading a 75mile road 
between gasquet and orleans to accommodate the hauling of timber 
and to enhance public access to that part of the forest 
twenty miles of the road is located on nonfederal land and is 
maintained by del norte county calif according to government 
lawyers the forest service has spent about 17 million upgrading 
49 of the roads 55 miles over federal land 
but a sixmile stretch of the road in the chimney rock section 
of the forest remains unpaved and is accessible only six months a 
year 
forest service plans to complete the road and allow the 
harvesting of timber in the high country region were challenged 
by members of the three tribes various environmental groups and 
state authorities 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1986 found that the 
high country is indispensible to a significant number of indian 
healers and religious leaders as a place where they receive the 
power that permits them to fill their religious roles that are 
central to the traditional religions 
although the development would not intrude on any sites of 
indian religious ceremonies the appeals court said the development 
indirectly would produce an irreparable impact 
in enacting the california wilderness act of 1984 congress 
designated most of six rivers national forest as a wilderness area 
since commercial activities are prohibited in such areas timber 
harvesting generally is banned 
but the 1984 law exempted a narrow stretch of land from the 
wilderness designation to enable the completion of the 
gasquetorleans road project if the responsible authorities so 
decide 
in rejecting the indians religiousfreedom argument oconnor 
said that nothing in our opinion should be read to encourage 
governmental insensitivity to the religious needs of any citizen 
the governments rights to the use of its own land for 
example need not and should not discourage it from accommodating 
religious practices like those engaged in by the indians 
she noted that government officials had taken numerous steps 
in this very case to minimize the impact that construction of the 
road will have on the indians religious activities 
voting with oconnor were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white john paul stevens and antonin scalia 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry a 
blackmun dissented 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the case 
writing for the dissenters brennan said the courts ruling 
essentially leaves native americans with absolutely no 
constitutional protection against perhaps the gravest threat to 
their religious practices 
i find it difficult to imagine conduct more insensitive to 
religious needs than the governments determination to build a 
marginally useful road in the face of uncontradicted evidence that 
the road will render the practice of the indians religion 
impossible brennan said 
the case is lyng vs northwest indian cemetery protection

jesse jackson hailed a victory in delaware as 
the hors doeuvre before todays presidential feast in new 
york while michael dukakis hoped the new york primary results 
would be a sign of things to come and make him the clear 
frontrunner democrats have sought 
turnout in new york city was described as quite heavy as voting 
began on a cool dry day 
at an east harlem polling place jackson said his victory over 
dukakis in delaware caucuses monday night is another evidence of 
how broad our support is delaware was the hors doeuvre new york 
is a fourcourse meal 
dukakis gtreeted commuters at a queens subway stop and said i 
hope i can do well today and win today and i hope i can come back 
as the nominee its been a terrific exciting interesting couple 
of weeks and i hope if all goes well today a sign of things to 
come 
the massachusetts governor also seeking to end confusion over 
his position on the fighting in the persian gulf said us action 
against iran was appropriate under the circumstances 
dukakis made a brief statement to reporters on the persian gulf 
situation but took no questions on the issue on monday he told 
one reporter he considered the action a measured response then 
refused to comment at two news conferences 
sen albert gore jr needing a surprise showing to salvage his 
debtridden candidacy shook hands with commuters arriving in 
manhattan at penn station 
with strong support from the states large black electorate 
jackson was hoping for an upset that would allow him to claim the 
status as frontrunner 
bea dolen executive director of the new york city board of 
elections described turnout as quite heavy throughout the city 
she predicted it would top 50 percent and said ill have to 
wait and see later if it goes above 60 
about 25 million of the states 35 million eligible democratic 
voters live in the city 
pollsters while saying the massachusetts governor had a lead of 
anywhere from 10 to 17 points also were warning about the 
volatility of the race 
we could all be wrong new york is a killer said abc news 
pollster john brennan 
heading into the new york race jackson scored a win in 
delawares democratic caucuses monday night beating dukakis 45 
percent to 27 percent gore had just 2 percent but the delaware 
contest was dwarfed by the big new york primary with its prize of 
255 democratic delegates 
untroubled by any doubts about his grasp on the republican 
presidential nomination vice president george bush was expected to 
sweep the 96 gop delegates at stake today in new york 
for dukakis new york offered an opportunity to break away from 
his pursuers and finally establish himself as the frontrunner as 
the race moves on to pennsylvania next tuesday and ohio indiana 
and the district of columbia the week after that 
the latest associated press delegate count gave dukakis 877 
jackson 745 and gore 417 a total of 2082 was needed for a 
convention majority 
the new york campaign was marked by an emphasis on candidate 
views on the middle east and by the long shadows of two 
noncandidates gov mario cuomo and mayor edward koch 
turnout in todays polling was critical and all three 
democratic contenders spent the final hours of campaigning urging 
their supporters to go to the polls 
if you stand in the rain today you will vote in the rain 
tomorrow jackson told supporters in harlem on a wet monday 
weve come too close nothing can stop us now 
just dont forget to vote tomorrow dukakis told his backers 
gore campaigned with koch whose attacks on jackson often got 
more attention than the sparring between the candidates 
during the campaign the mayor said jews and other supporters of 
israel would have to be crazy to vote for jackson koch also 
said the former civil rights activist lied under pressure and would 
lead the democrats to their worst defeat since 1972 when 
republican richard m nixon carried 49 states 
koch was asked repeatedly about his weekend comments criticizing 
jackson im not saying hes a liar im saying he cant stand 
stress and then he lies under stress he said 
jackson tried to avoid being drawn into a running battle with 
koch but said at a news conference monday that we have received 
more death threats in this campaign than in all the other combined 
because the climate has been so divisive and so violent 
the namecalling and the accusations and the attempts of a 
provocation by the mayor have not been good for the city or the 
campaign jackson said 
cuomo who praised all three contenders but endorsed none said 
that kochs tactic of attacking jesse jacksons character might 
boomerang 
jackson is not getting enough whites said pollster lee 
miringoff chief of the marist college institute for public 
opinion and he said gore does not appear to have gotten into the 
numbers where he will close the margin 
polling sunday and monday by abc and the washington post found 
dukakis rebounding after losing some ground friday and saturday 
the combined sundaymonday results were dukakis 51 percent 
jackson 34 percent and sen albert gore jr 9 percent 
a cbs news survey saturday and sunday had a narrower spread 
with dukakis at 43 percent jackson at 33 and gore at 12 a gallup 
poll done friday through sunday put the race at dukakis 45 jackson

joined polish officials today in offering flowers and prayers to 
the memory of fallen antinazi warriors of the warsaw jewish ghetto 
uprising 
the 45th anniversary ceremony took place on a broad plaza in 
front of the ghetto fighters monument in warsaw where the sounds 
of gunfire echoed on the morning of april 19 1943 
heavily armed squadrons of german nazi troops that day entered 
the walled jewish quarter bent on quick final annihilation of the 
last 70000 inhabitants instead they were routed and the 
starving poorly armed residents held off nazi troops for three 
more weeks 
we have to remember yes but not a paralyzing memory 
israeli deputy prime minister itzhak navon told the crowd of about 
4000 people in english not only remember the past but we 
should derive a new determination from that tragedy to continue 
living 
navon whose visit to poland is considered private expressed 
thanks to polish authorities for the ceremony the two countries do 
not have fullfledged diplomatic relations 
six million jews were put to death in the world war ii 
holocaust 3 million of them polish 
earlier today about 100 arab and african students carrying 
palestinian flags briefly marched through the city also to 
commemorate the ghetto fighters 
the students drew parallels between the ghetto battles and the 
4monthold palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip the protesters distributed leaflets to passersby 
recounting what they said were israeli cruelties 
before the official ceremony henryk jablonski chairman of the 
polish veteran organization zbowid which organized the observance 
planted an oak tree on the plaza as a symbol of hope 
then to the beat of military drums delegations from veterans 
jewish and polish groups laid wreath after wreath of flowers at 
the foot of the monument a relief of armed fighters crouched 
together facing their foes 
the monument near the citys heart was the first erected on 
the destroyed left bank of warsaw after the war 
as poles and israelis stood side by side around the square a 
cantor sang kaddish the jewish song of mourning rabbi isser

secretary of state george p shultz left today 
for talks in moscow to try to eliminate differences in us and 
soviet drafts of the new arms control treaty to slash longrange 
nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent 
shultz was scheduled to depart at 8 am but a mechanical 
problem with his air force jet delayed the takeoff until 1036 am 
about half of the 1200 disputed items identified by american 
and soviet negotiators are technical and could be resolved if major 
verification problems are worked out reagan administration 
officials said monday 
but the others have proved intractable so far involving the 
detection and counting of elusive mobile and cruise missiles 
carried on planes and warships said the officials who spoke only 
on condition of anonymity 
officials acknowledged that hopes were fading for the treaty to 
be ready for signing at the may 28june 2 summit meeting in the 
soviet capital 
theres always hope an official said but he said there has 
been virtually no progress in resolving differences between the two 
sides since shultz met in washington last month with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the official blamed a lack of cooperation on the soviet side 
im not one for bashing the soviets the official said in an 
interview but theyre not exactly following through on the 
problems and look at the calendar 
shultz is flying to helsinki and will go on to moscow on 
thursday for three days of talks with shevardnadze and a session 
with general secretary mikhail s gorbachev he will also make 
stops in kiev and tblisi the capitals of the ukraine and soviet 
georgia 
shultz will brief officials of the north atlantic treaty 
organization in brussels on monday and then return home 
the monthly meetings are in preparation for president reagans 
visit to moscow for talks with gorbachev may 29june 2 reagan 
would like to crown his fourth and probably final superpower summit 
meeting with a treaty to reduce longrange bombers missiles and 
submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
but a senior us official briefing reporters under rules of 
anonymity said four drafts prepared by american and soviet 
negotiators had 1200 distinct items of disagreement bracketed 
the drafts deal with verifying the reductions disposing of 
banned weapons an exchange of information on us and soviet 
arsenals and the treaty itself a fifth and separate draft deals 
with spacebased defenses 
the longer time goes by without solving these issues the more 
unlikely there will be a signing in moscow the official said 
but well keep trying 
the reagan administration is insisting on a strict verification 
system this requires procedures for monitoring what the other side 
retains in its arsenal 
shultz also will talk to shevardnadze and gorbachev about other 
subjects including the iraniraq war the middle east and human 
rights 
since last july he has tried and failed to persuade the soviets 
to join in calling for an international arms embargo against iran 
in order to force a ceasefire in the 7year war in the persian 
gulf 
this has kept the united states from pressing the issue in the 
united nations security council since the soviets have the power to 
veto any resolution 
in the middle east shultz wants the soviets to accept a limited 
role in a peace conference king hussein of jordan and president 
hafez assad of syria would prefer the soviets be active in shaping 
a settlement while israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir objects 
to their involvement since the soviets usually side with the arabs 
in middle east disputes 
on human rights the senior official said shultz would try to 
make soviet emigration easier the united states wants the soviets 
to drop a provision for denying a visa if another family member 
objects and to ease restrictions on applicants involved in 
sensitive work in the past

the supreme court today made it easier for 
creditors to recover debts owed by dead people 
the justices voting 81 revived a claim by an oklahoma bill 
collection agency that said it unfairly was denied the chance to 
recover part of a hospital bill owed by a former patient who died 
the agency tulsa professional collection services inc is 
seeking to collect 14657 from the family of the late h everett 
pope jr 
pope ran up a 142000 bill at st john medical center in tulsa 
from nov 23 1978 until he died the following april 2 insurance 
covered all but the amount sought by the bill collector 
popes family published a newspaper notice to creditors after 
his will was admitted to probate in july 1979 
oklahoma law requires that any creditor claiming money from an 
estate file such a claim within two months of the probate notice 
tulsa professional collection services which missed the 
deadline said it was denied due process because it was not 
notified directly of the probate proceedings 
the supreme court today said the agency has a legitimate case 
justice sandra day oconnor in her opinion for the court said 
if the pope family knew about the collection agency or could have 
determined its identity by a reasonable effort it was required to 
notify the creditor directly by mail for example about the 
probate proceedings 
the court set aside a decision by the oklahoma supreme court in 
favor of the pope family and ordered further lower court 
proceedings to determine whether the pope family knew the 
collection agency was owed money or whether the agencys identity 
was reasonably ascertainable 
chief justice william h rehnquist dissented 
the case is tulsa professional collection services vs pope

new guidelines designed to eliminate 
disparity in sentencing will deprive judges of their independence 
say some federal jurists who met to consider the issue 
the us sentencing commission organized in 1984 as an arm of 
the federal judiciary adopted the sweeping guidelines last 
november in an attempt to end the disparities in criminal 
sentencing 
theyre cold and implacable and as immutable as a computer 
said us district judge james ideman one of 20 federal judges who 
met monday 
donald a purdy jr representing the commission said the 
guidelines were developed to increase respect for the law by 
ensuring that defendants are sentenced fairly he cited a 1974 
study of 50 judges that found sentences for the same crime ranged 
from three to 20 years 
the us supreme court will make the final determination on the 
guidelines 
several of the judges expressed irritation at the notion of any 
independent commission fixing sentencing options for federal judges 
the guidelines proposed at congress direction established a 
range of penalties for all federal crimes that occurred after nov 
1 minimum and maximum penalties do not vary more than 25 percent 
and judges arent permitted to deviate unless a case involves 
factors not considered by the commission 
the controversial guidelines have prompted divided opinions from 
district judges throughout the country 
opponents have argued that the commission as an arm of the 
judicial branch did not have authority to assume what has been a 
function of the legislative branch 
what it does is it destroys all the discretionary function of 
a judge and it gives an opportunity for prosecutorial 
misbehavior us district judge dickran tevrizian said monday

prosecutors today dismissed charges of marijuana 
possession against margaret kemper the exwife of former prime 
minister pierre elliott trudeau 
ms kemper had been charged march 17 after royal canadian 
mounted police used a search warrant to seize a package at her home 
federal prosecutor keith ward said a defect in the warrant would 
have made successful prosecution impossible 
a copy of the search warrant used at ms kempers home said an 
informer in british columbia told police ms kemper would be 
receiving a pound of marijuana through the mail in eight separate 
packages 
ward said the problem with the warrant was that the marijuana 
was not delivered until sometime after the warrant was signed he 
said the pollice officer who requested the warrant had told the 
court that the marijuana had been received 
ward said he had decided to drop the charge 
i am the prosecutor the one who received the case ward 
said this was my decision 
he denied any suggestion that ms kemper received special 
treatment 
it has been treated like any other threedashone possession 
charge as far as is possible ward said ive never seen so 
much press interest in a threedashone 
ms kemper 39 did not have to appear in court on the charge a 
conviction could have carried a maximum fine of 1000 or six 
months in jail or both although lesser penalties are usually 
imposed 
trudeau and his wife were divorced in 1983 she married ottawa 
real estate developer fried kemper the following year with whom 
she has one son

the supreme court today ruled against a group 
of minnesota welfare recipients who said they were given inadequate 
notice about a change in their eligibility for federal benefits 
the court voting 53 said states are not required to provide 
advance written notice about the effects of 1981 changes in 
eligibility requirements of the aid to families with dependent 
children program 
under the afdc program states determine a familys eligibility 
after calculating its income and resources 
prior to 1981 when an afdc recipient received a lump sum of 
money from any source such as an insurance settlement or lottery 
winnings the money was treated as income in the month received 
and as resources in succeeding months 
congress in 1981 changed that policy in an attempt to discourage 
quick spending of windfalls providing that lumpsum income is to 
be prorated over a period of months the change generally limits 
the eligibility after a family receives lumpsum income 
a group of minnesota women who receive afdc benefits sued state 
authorities in 1983 contending that they were not given advance 
notice about the lumpsum rule or the 1981 change in that rule 
a 37yearold minneapolis woman kathryn jenkins is the lone 
remaining named plaintiff in the class action lawsuit 
in october 1983 the jenkins family received a 5752 disability 
check raymond jenkins a former metropolitan transit commission 
bus driver wrote checks the same day to cover back mortgage 
payments and an overdue carrepair bill 
the family also spent about 600 on childrens clothing and 
other items 
although the disability payment was quickly spent the jenkins 
family was declared ineligible for afdc benefits for eight months 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled in late 1986 that 
imposition of the lumpsum rule on the jenkinses was unfair because 
no advance notice of the 1981 rule change had been received 
today the nations highest court disagreed and gave minnesota 
authorities a legal victory by reversing the appeals court ruling 
on what a federal notice regulation requires 
the regulation simply requires the state to publish a general 
description of the basic structure of the afdc program and its 
availability justice john paul stevens wrote for the court 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist byron r 
white harry a blackmun and antonin scalia 
justices sandra day oconnor william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
writing for the three oconnor said she thought the disputed 
notice regulation requires the minnesota department of human 
services to give applicants for afdc benefits written notice at 
least of the existence of the lumpsum rule and of the need for 
recipients to consult with a social worker before spending any lump 
sum they might receive 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the case 
the case is gardebring vs jenkins 86978

israeli today deported to lebanon six 
palestinians who were involved in a fatal clash with jewish 
settlers in a west bank village the army said 
two other arabs were expelled from israel and flown by an army 
helicopter to israels selfproclaimed security zone in south 
lebanon the army reported 
the deportations raised to 20 the number of palestinians 
expelled since the start of the palestinian uprising dec 8 more 
than 1000 arabs have been deported since 1967 
so far 167 palestinians have died in the unrest according to 
un figures two israelis also have been killed 
the army accused the deported palestinians of inciting and 
organizing disturbances in the occupied west bank it said they had 
appealed to an army review board but did not take their case to the 
supreme court 
army officials said the six beita residents were involved in a 
stoning attack against 16 jewish teenagers and two armed guards 
from a nearby west bank settlement on april 6 
a settler girl and two beita residents were killed in the clash 
an army report said the girl was killed by a bullet fired from the 
weapon of one of the jewish guards 
the army has destroyed the homes of 13 beita residents linked to 
the stoning attack 
hanna siniora a prominent palestinian editor said the 
deportations were a message that israel wants to continue the 
occupation and is disregarding palestinian national rights 
such a policy will inflame the situation and actually add to 
the determination of the palestinian people in their struggle for 
their national aspirations said siniora editor of the proplo 
daily newspaper al fajr 
the united states has condemned deportations saying the measure 
violated the geneva convention which bans the transfer across 
borders of civilians living in occupied zones 
israel which has not accepted the applicability of the 
conventions to the west bank and gaza strip has defended the 
practice saying only mass expulsions were barred and that such 
punishment was less severe than execution permitted by the 
conventions 
also today an israeli cabinet minister criticized the slaying 
of plo commander khalil alwazir warning it would backfire on 
israel the army censored a newspaper editorial about israels 
reported role in the assassination 
soldiers sealed off parts of the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip and clamped a curfew on 17 towns cities and refugee camps 
for a third straight day to quell rioting in the occupied 
territories the military said 
nineteen palestinians have been killed since saturdays slaying 
of alwazir who was second in command to palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafat 
israeli sources have confirmed that israeli commandos shot and 
killed alwazir at his home in a tunis suburb the nations leaders 
have so far refused to comment 
nbc television reported monday that mossad agents naval and 
army commandos carried out the assassination reaching their target 
by sea 
the report said the operation was approved at a cabinet meeting 
last week with two dissenters foreign minister shimon peres and 
cabinet minister ezer weizman 
in an interview with israel radio today weizman a former 
defense minister refused to comment on whether israel onducted the 
assassination but said 
it doesnt contribute to the fight against terrorism in 
principle it creates more it distances the peace process and will 
bring greater hostility and make us more vulnerable around the 
world 
alwazirs body was flown to syria today his funeral is 
scheduled for wednesday 
israels military censor meanwhile took a rare step and 
censored an entire editorial by the masscirculation yediot ahronot 
daily which newspaper sources said dealt with israels role in 
alwazirs killing 
the editorial appeared as a blank white space with only a title 
that read they are silent but speak dov yudkovsky the 
newspapers editor declined to comment on the action 
also today the israeliappointed mayor of nablus hafez tuqan 
declined to comment on media reports that he planned to resign from 
his post because of the 4monthlong uprising in the territories 
israel occupied in the 1967 middle east war 
a leaflet published this month by the proplo underground called 
on tuqan and other israeliappointed municipal officials to leave 
their jobs 
tuqan stepped in as nablus mayor in march 1986 after 
israeliappointed zafer almasri was assassinated by prosyrian 
extremists 
nablus the west banks largest city with 120000 residents and 
16 other towns and refugee camps in the west bank have been under 
curfew since sunday

from delivering food to the camps 5000 residents

sardines corned beef beans cooking oil powdered milk and rice 
to enter the camp according to bill lee a spokesman for the un

gov joe frank harris says a federal ranking of 
state education efforts is unfair and incomplete and he wants the 
education department to stop its annual wall chart comparing 
statebystate improvements 
the report fails to acknowledge the diminished role of the 
federal government in improving education while holding individual 
states up to public criticism for failure to meet unspecified 
federal expectations harris said in a letter to education 
secretary william bennett 
premature reporting on education programs improvements and 
achievements is discouraging to those who are implementing major 
reforms in public education such improvements can only be 
reached by longterm committment harris said in the letter 
mailed friday and distributed to reporters monday 
bennett has been using the wall chart for five years to show the 
educational performance of each state 
in the latest chart released in february georgia was 20th in 
combined scholastic aptitude test scores 48th in graduation rates 
44th in perpupil expenditure 40th in studentteacher ratios and 
27th in average teacher salaries 
harris letter which was drafted by state education officials 
complained that the education departments statistics are wrong it 
repeated complaints about using sat scores saying the test is 
weighted more as a college admissions test in some states than 
others 
it said the teacher salary comparisons do not take into account 
each states cost of living and it noted that some states include 
general equivalency diploma holders as high school graduates 
valena plisko director of elementary and secondary planning at 
the us education department defended the chart saying it has 
been effective in prodding the states to improve their 
performance

band leader glenn millers career 
might not have been quite as successful had the founders of this 
tennessee river city picked a different name 150 years ago 
after all pardon me boy is that the montevideo choo choo 
doesnt really sing does it 
montevideo was one of several possibilities considered by land 
commissioners when they were naming the new town at rosss landing 
in 1838 says james livingood a hamilton county historian 
other nominees were lookout city albion and the eventual 
winner the cherokee indian word for rock coming to a point a 
reference to lookout mountain 
there was spirited debate livingood said sunday during a 
program marking chattanoogas 150th birthday 
the commissioners settled on chattanooga livingood said 
because one observer noted that although the sound of the name was 
perhaps outlandish the citys success would make the name 
pleasant and familiar and besides there will be not another 
like it anywhere in the world 
that prediction didnt exactly pan out there is a town in 
oklahoma with the same name but chattanooga has come a long way 
in the last century and a half say those who have governed it in 
recent years

tunisian ambassador habib ben yahia said today 
his country has evidence that israel carried out last weekends 
assassination of a palestinian leader in tunisia 
ben yahia said the most conclusive piece of evidence was the 
presence of a boeing 707 aircraft with israeli markings off the 
tunisian coast at the time of the assassination 
the plane carrying sophisticated electronic equipment was used 
to jam telecommunications around the town where khalil alwazir 
lived he said the planes registration number was 4x977 he said 
israels international aircraft designation code is 4x 
ben yahia said the governmentappointed inquiry panel had found 
that the commandos used 9mm israelimade uzi submachine guns to 
kill alwazir one of the top leaders of the palestine liberation 
organization two bodyguards and a tunisian gardner reports from 
tunisia said the attack was carried out by seven people 
he said the team used false lebanese passports to enter tunisia 
driving two volkswagen minibuses and a peugeot car rented from a 
tunis car rental agency to reach alwazirs home the cars were 
later found abandoned on a beach 10 miles from the scene of the 
attack he said 
the inquiry panel is still investigating whether the commandos 
got away by boat he said 
in all ben yahia said the preliminary investigation had 
determined the unequivocable responsibility of the israeli 
government for saturdays assassination of alwazir by a commando 
team 
unconfirmed reports from israel say the operation was carried 
out by navy frogmen commandos and the mossad intelligence agency 
israel has refused to confirm or deny allegations of its 
involvement

five times the warning 
blared from the bridge on the uss jack williams silkworm 
incoming five times the iranian missiles missed their target a 
three ship attack group from the us navy 
the usiranian feud exploded into missile warfare monday as 
the united states attacked two iranian platforms in retaliation for 
a mine that blew a hole in a us frigate last week in the persian 
gulf 
during the day the surface action group led by the 
williams a guidedmissile frigate came under attack five times 
from irans silkworm antiship missile batteries 
although navy officers on the williams identified the missiles 
as silkworms the pentagon and adm william crowe chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff did not confirm they were the chinesemade 
rockets the pentagon said today it was still analyzing the attack 
silkworm incoming blared the bridge lurching the jack 
williams into violent maneuvers 
crewmen scrambled to spot the oncoming missiles 
everybody look astern everybody look astern lt augustino 
ponturier the officer of the deck shouted to junior officers and 
lookouts 
the gas turbinedrive frigate rolled sharply and pointed its 
stern toward the approaching missile presenting its smallest 
target and allowing the aluminumchaff launchers and other 
defensive weapons a clear shot 
none of the first four silkworms came close enough to be seen 
but members of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck as 
the fifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oil 
rig with an orangeyellow flash 
officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system 
not one of these ladies has a scratch on her and the other 
guys cant say that said capt don dyer operational commander 
of the force 
in all six iranian ships were damaged by us fire monday 
dyer said a c130 aircraft that was spotting targets for the 
silkworm batteries was tracked by us jets off the nuclearpowered 
aircraft carrier enterprise and was almost shot down 
us officials reported one us helicopter with two crew 
members aboard missing monday and the search for it continued 
today they denied iranian claims that the vessel was shot down 
the williams with members of a pentagon news media pool aboard 
was the operational flagship for one of the three surface action 
groups taking part in the fighting monday in the southern gulf 
the others in the group were the destroyers joseph strauss and 
obrien 
mondays operations began when us warships destroyed two 
iranianowned oil platforms 
over the next few hours us navy forces sank two missilearmed 
patrol boats damaged two others and bombed and rocketed two 
frigates 
one of the iranian frigates the sahand was hit by a harpoon 
missile fired from the strauss 
the white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke and 
streaked for the horizon as the men on the williams bridge 
cheered wildly yeah yeah yeah 
a flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon followed by a 
long series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunition 
aboard the sahand blew up 
lt cmdr mark van dyke a spokesman for the navys joint task 
force middle east said a us pilot who observed the sahand 
reported it listing badly with a big hole in its port side the 
superstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in the 
water 
shortly after f14 jet fighters from the enterprise attacked 
the sahands sister frigate the sabalan after it fired a missile 
at the aircraft 
us army maj barry willey a central command officer 
accompanying the media pool said the view from the bridge atop the 
williams was both spectacular and frightening contrails from 
missiles could be seen in almost every direction 
the oil platform attacks were aimed at what us officials 
called military targets both the sassan and sirri platforms have 
been used by the iranians for military purposes they say 
the strikes were ordered after the frigate samuel b roberts hit 
a mine which us officials say was laid by iran in the central 
gulf last thursday ten crewman were injured 
while other task groups were attacking the platforms the 
williams unit was sailing halfway through the strait or hormuz in 
calm seas under clear skies within range of the iranian silkworm 
batteries 
van dyke said the misssion of the three ships was to exercise 
the right of innocent transit passage and respond to all 
contingencies 
and thats when the missile attacks came apparently the first 
time iran had fired the chinesemade rockets at ships in the strait 
of hormuz and the southern gulf 
later monday as the williams and its accompanying warships 
sailed out of the silkworm envelope into safer waters and a 
setting sun the alert level was lowered from general quarters 
to the next lowest condition onealpha 
ponturier of red bank nj took off his steel helmet and 
walked toward the door its miller time he said

president reagan said today it seems to be 
quieting down in the persian gulf after a round of sea and air 
battles monday in which the united states dealt a heavy blow to 
iranian forces 
we hope it continues that way reagan told reporters during 
a phototaking session at the start of a meeting with republican 
members of congress 
iran took a licking when it tried to strike back after the 
united states destroyed two iranian oil platforms in the most 
intense exchanges since reagan beefed up us firepower in the gulf 
last summer american forces sank or damaged four iranian attack 
boats and disabled two frigates that fired missiles at us planes 
asked if the united states had underestimated what the iranian 
response would be reagan replied no 
it seems to be quieting down we hope it continues that way 
reagan said 
reagan said nine ships were involved in a searchandrescue 
mission for a us marine helicopter missing with two crewmen from 
mondays operation the attack helicopter on a reconnaissance 
mission had been due to land on the uss wainwright by 
midafternoon monday washington time 
besides the ships which searched through the night the navy 
sent several aircraft aloft today as part of the search for the 
helicopter irans official islamic republic news agency said that 
iranian warships had brought down a us helicopter 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that adm william 
crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had briefed reagan 
and the republican congressional leadership on the situation in the 
gulf essentially fitzwater quoted crowe as saying iranian naval 
ships were in port today 
meanwhile leaders of the senate armed services committee said 
that while they support reagans action the united states should 
reassess its goitalone policy of protecting the vital sea lanes 
this is an action that was taken that was justified and i 
think measured said sen sam nunn dga the committees 
chairman but i think weve got to make sure that we dont 
convert this into a usiranian war 
sen john warner of virginia the committees ranking 
republican said wed like to see a more coordinated 
participation by our allies in the gulf our allies are there 
but thus far they have declined efforts by our nation to suggest 
that we work at a more coordinated fashion 
nunn and warner were interviewed on nbctvs today show 
both democrats and republicans in congress united monday behind 
reagans warning that iran will pay a price if it persists in 
trying to trade blows with a militarily superior force of american 
warships and aircraft in the persian gulf 
nunn said today that we need to reexamine our policy of 
protecting only 11 kuwaiti ships many people dont realize it 
but if a british ship or a french ship is attacked by an iraqi 
aircraft right in the sight of our own american ship we dont do 
anything that has given the perception that we have lined up with 
the iraqis 
weve got to correct that perception and weve got to 
reexamine our policy nunn said but the senator also said that 
we need to get our allies to protect certain zones 
house minority leader robert michel rill appearing on abcs 
good morning america said i think we dont want to 
unilaterally be there the policemen over there 
rep robert torricelli dnj a member of the house foreign 
affairs committee said on the same program that were not really 
protecting international shipping what were protecting is ships 
flying the american flag many of the criticisms that we had when 
this policy began is that we began it unilaterally without getting 
international cooperation 
as time has gone on the british the french and the italians 
have come to assume roles he said but indeed if there was a 
mistake in the policy originally we did not act together and 
get cooperation when this began 
the initial platform attack had been in retaliation for the mine 
explosion last week that damaged the uss samuel b roberts and 
injured 10 crewmen fitzwater said there is conclusive evidence 
that iran planted the mine that exploded friday 
they must know that we will protect our ships and if they 
threaten us theyll pay a price the president said in a speech 
to a business audience 
on capitol hill reagan won applause for consulting with 
congress before sending the military into action 
the mines have been clearly identified as manufactured by the 
iranians and sown in the waters by the iranians said senate 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva the iraniare carrying out 
terrorist acts 
defense secretary frank carlucci said irans decision to fight 
back amounted to foolhardy behavior 
im not sure that its explainable in terms of western logic 
at this point carlucci said at a pentagon news conference i 
have to only assume that its some kind of a fanatical reaction or 
slavish obedience to a contingency plan 
it certainly makes no sense whatsoever in military terms and 
we hope that tomorrow that will bring peace in the region 
from the white house to the pentagon to the state department 
the message to iran was the same cool it or else 
reagan said the us attacks on the oil platforms which are 
used as staging areas for iranian gunboats were a measured 
response to the mining of the gulf 
while saying the united states wants a more normal relationship 
with iran reagan said weve taken this action to make certain 
the iranians have no illusions about the cost of irresponsible 
behavior we aim to deter further iranian aggression not provoke 
the incident was the second such outbreak of violence since the 
united states began escorting oil tankers through the gulf last 
july to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the 
7year iraniraq war 
on oct 19 a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack 
on a kuwaiti ship flying the us flag in which 18 americans were 
injured two iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what reagan at 
the time termed a prudent response

vice president george bush said today he 
eagerly awaits the fall presidential campaign against the democrats 
even if they unleash mario cuomo 
bush also defended anew the us military strikes in the persian 
gulf saying they were designed to teach madmen like the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini a lesson 
from having read the intelligence reports this morning 
response around the world and in the countries in the area some 
whom wont publicly state it has been very strong and very 
understanding bush told an audience here 
we have a disproportionate responsibility to keep the sea 
lanes open and for the stability of the moderate states in the 
area bush said 
he also told the gop breakfast that he was eager and ready to 
take on the democrats in the fall pennsylvanias primary will be 
held next tuesday 
i cant wait for the debates with the democratic nominee no 
matter who he turns out to be the virtually certain gop nominee 
said even if they unleash mario cuomo i cant wait 
the new york governor has cast a long shadow over the democratic 
race even though he has declined to run for the nomination 
bush has been citing the u a difficult language it forces 
me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that im not used 
too im constantly in danger of getting stuck 
for the interview ustinov made his remarks in nearly fluent but 
cautiously enunciated german 
the play opened in west berlin in january and has been sold out 
ever since more than 40000 people are expected to see the 
production before its scheduled april 30 closing gisela huwe a 
theater spokeswoman said 
beethovens tenth is one of the greatest successes in the 
40year history of the schiller huwe said of the twoact play 
written by ustinov 
much of the plays action concentrates on efforts by a fictional 
london music critic named stephen winter to imagine how beethovens 
10th symphony might have sounded it also focuses on his often 
stormy relations with his son pascal who composes modern 
symphonies which winter has no use for 
a viennese aupair girl named irmgard who loves beethoven and 
pascal manages to wake the composer from the dead the composer 
rings the doorbell and strides with long hair flowing across the 
stage 
with the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor 
the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first 
time 
ludwig van beethovens last completed symphony is his ninth 
the choral music researchers however say they have discovered 
sketches for an unfinished symphony possibly a 10th dated after 
completion of his ninth symphony and before his death in 1827 
in ustinovs play the audience never learns how the 10th 
symphony really sounded but the resurrected genius helps bring the 
feuding winter family closer together 
critics say ustinovs often deliberate german delivery adds to 
the performance increasing audience empathy to the character of 
beethoven who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a 
rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave 
ustinov said he especially enjoys playing on the west berlin 
stage 
the actor is in direct contact with the audience here he 
said the people are very warmhearted 
ustinov is internationally known for his versatility as a stage 
and screen actor and in recent years has become best known for his 
portrayal of agatha christies belgian sleuth hercule poirot 
he has written several other plays a collection of short 
stories and a novel 
in film he gained prominence for his portrayal of nero in 
mervyn le roys 1951 hollywood epic quo vadis he is also 
known as the voice of babar the elephant a popular childrens book 
character created by the late french author jean de brunhoff

anthony perkins the evil antihero of the 
hitchcock thriller psycho will play two roles actually 
different sides of the same person in his next film officials 
said tuesday 
perkins will play both star characters in a film of robert louis

hyde the story of a doctor who led a second life in the form of 
villain edward hyde

experimenting with drugs said the actor adding that he did not 
dabble in drugs himself

brown university has rejected plans by 
the cable television station mtv to cover its spring celebration 
for fear of being portrayed as a party school an official said 
tuesday 
student organizers turned down mtvs request to cover the 
fourday series of concerts and parties after robert reichley the 
schools vice president for university relations expressed strong 
disapproval 
reichley said he was disturbed by last years mtv coverage 
which featured spring parties at the university of connecticut 
syracuse university indiana university and san diego state 
it was very clear to us that they emphasized all of the party 
social and drinking side of the thing reichley said i just 
dont think we have any desire to fall on our own spear and expose 
ourselves to that kind of thing 
eric broudy director of the brown news bureau also watched the 
tape 
people were seeming out of control broudy said what we 
didnt want was to have brown portrayed as a big party 
doug herzog mtvs senior vice president of programs disagreed 
with browns interpretation of the tapes 
when we go to any campus we try to represent more than just 
one aspect of a school herzog said tuesday through a 
spokeswoman although most schools welcome our presence we 
understand browns position 
the spokeswoman tina exarhos said this years program would 
feature san diego state indiana tulane university and the 
university of missouri 
brown has been in an unflattering spotlight several times in the 
last few years including the highly publicized december trial in 
which an insurance executive was acquitted of charges that he 
organized a prostitution ring involving brown students 
keith wexelblatt cochairman of the spring weekend planning 
committee said he was disappointed but agreed with the 
administrators decision

arab hijackers of a kuwaiti jet today 
brought a 20yearold woman related to the emir of kuwait to a 
microphone and she pleaded kuwait to meet the hijackers demands as 
the ordeal entered its third week 
if not we are all in danger said anware alsabah 
anware and her 22yearold sister ibtesam are the only two 
women left among the approximately 35 hostages all thought to be 
kuwaitis 
it was the first time either of them has been made to plead for 
the hijackers cause 
in a tense but firm voice anware said we want you to tell 
our families that my sister and i and all the passengers are well 
although our morale is low 
i hope from my family and government that they will hurry to 
free the prisoners if not we are all in danger thank you 
it was the fifth time since the plane landed in algiers early 
wednesday that the hijackers have broadcast appeals from hostages 
for the kuwait government to release 17 men convicted on terrorist 
charges in kuwait 
the proiranian prisoners were responsible for the 1983 attacks 
on the us and french embassies in the persian gulf sheikdom 
another of the emirs cousin fadel khaled alsabah believed 
suffering from a nervous disorder broadcast an almost incoherent 
but similar message sunday 
kuwait has refused to meet the demand there has been no 
apparent break in the stalemate although algerian mediators 
continued their active shuttle between the plane and a highlevel 
kuwaiti delegation 
this morning contact with the moslem shiite hijackers began with 
a request radioed to the control tower good morning said one 
of the hijackers speaking clearly in english wed like to have 
water for the plane someone to clean the toilets and newspapers 
five in arabic and three in french we also need one medicine 
interviaform a treatement for diarrhea 
a yellow car carried an airport worker to the plane to fill the 
request 
as the moslem holy month of ramadan began on monday the 
hijackers requested copies of the koran the moslem holy book 
which were delivered 
during ramadan observant moslems do not eat or drink during 
daylight hours at the hijackers request a traditional prefast 
meal was delivered to the plane sunday night for all aboard 
the kuwait airways flight from thailand to kuwait was hijacked 
april 5 with 112 people aboard and forced to land in mashhad iran 
where 57 eventually were released on april 8 the jet flew to 
larnaca cyprus where two passengers were killed and 13 freed 
since landing in algiers one passenger has been freed the five to 
eight hijackers are armed with grenades and guns and have 
threatened to blow up the plane 
a hostage freed on thursday 70yearold djumaa abdallah chatti 
flew out of algeria on monday night on a kuwaiti executive jet 
escorted to the plane by four members of the kuwaiti negotiating 
delegation chatti waved to television cameras before getting on 
the plane but said nothing 
the hijackers only direct threat in algeria was that made 
saturday when they asked that the plane be refueled so they could 
settle our score with kuwait in another country rather than in 
friendly algeria 
radio conversations on monday made no reference to refueling the 
plane or leaving algeria radio algiers said in an arabic language 
news broadcast on monday that there was hope that a peaceful 
solution is still possible despite no indication that either side 
would make any concessions 
the oficial radio reported new movement that gives a chance 
for new elements but did not elaborate 
algerian officials have been acting as mediators between a 
kuwaiti delegation and the gunmen boarding the plane several times 
a day for talks 
interior minister hedi khediri in charge of the mediation 
effort said early on he had obtained a promise from the hijackers 
that they would not resort to violence on algerian soil

about 35 soviet jews seeking to draw attention to 
their demand to emigrate prior to the visit of us secretary of 
state george p shultz demonstrated peacefully tuesday at the 
moscow visa office 
scores of soviets stopped to watch the demonstrators display 
banners saying end lawlessness let us go to our children and 
grandchildren and other slogans 
about a dozen uniformed police were on hand and after about 
five minutes one of them approached the protesters and asked them 
to take down their signs they complied and there were no arrests 
one of the protesters yuli kosharovsky said the protesters 
support the meetings between top us and soviet officials leading 
up to the may 29june 2 summit meeting 
we want the dialogue between the soviet union and america to 
continue and continue productively kosharovsky said but we 
want to stress that our destiny here is terrible 
kosharovsky said he has been refused permission to emigrate to 
israel for 17 years because of unlawful decisions by anonymous 
bureaucrats he said officials have said he had access to state 
secrets while working in a factory in the ural mountain city of 
sverdlov 
shultz is to arrive in moscow on thursday for the latest in a 
series of monthly contacts leading up to the summit meeting both 
sides are trying to work out an agreement to cut longrange nuclear 
missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent 
but shultz also has brought up human rights issues in the 
meetings with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
mikhail s gorbachev and other top officials 
shultz plans to meet with refuseniks at the home of a us 
diplomat during his visit to moscow this week 
another refusenik in the crowd tanya zeman said those who have 
not received permission to leave the soviet union are getting 
desperate 
more than 8000 jews were allowed to emigrate in 1987 including 
such wellknown figures as josef begun vladimir slepak and ida 
nudel the 1987 total was higher than recent years but still far 
below the 1979 total of more than 51000 
the genevabased intergovernmental agency for migration said 944 
jews were allowed to emigrate in march the highest monthly total 
since july 1981

a giant us air force c5b aircraft has 
delivered 45 tons of detection gear to the soviet unions nuclear 
test site in an unprecendented flight the energy department said 
the gear is designed to help the united states determine the 
size of a future soviet nuclear test scheduled to take place 
sometime this summer 
the gear left indian springs air force base northwest of las 
vegas friday afternoon aboard the giant aircraft and arrived at an 
airfield on the soviet site sunday evening us time doe 
spokesman chris west said monday 
a dozen test site scientists and workers were also on board and 
joined 10 other us personnel who had gone to the soviet site at 
semipalatinsk earlier this month 
seven soviet scientists are currently at the nevada test site 
preparing to monitor an american blast sometime this summer 
theyve been to ground zero a couple of times and are planning 
where theyll put their equipment west said 
the exchange is designed to test monitoring equipment the two

insurance to cover the costs of nursing home 
care has been promoted increasingly in the last few years but 
probably isnt a good buy for most americans a national consumer 
group said tuesday 
and anyone considering such coverage should study the policy 
carefully consumers union warned even insurance sales 
representatives are confused about what coverage is being offered 
officials of the group said at a news conference 
consumers union rates more than 50 longterm care policies in 
the may edition of its magazine consumer reports and finds some 
fault with every one of them 
the private insurance system cannot spread its costs over a 
large enough number of people to make coverage affordable to the 
millions who need it consumers union president rhoda karpatkin 
said 
only the federal government can do that she said calling for 
congressional action to provide longterm care protection 
gail shearer of the consumers group said policies providing 
longterm care are quite expensive and are not recommended for 
people of moderate income prices can range as high as 100 a month 
to 260 a month 
and people under 60 shouldnt buy such policies unless there is 
some guarantee that benefits will rise to keep pace with inflation 
ms shearer added 
nonetheless many policies are being offered and some people may 
be tempted to buy them she said 
problems to watch out for include 
protection may not be available to people who need it most 
those with health problems already check policies for exclusions 
that disallow coverage for preexisting conditions 
some policies were found to cover only certain types of care 
but not custodial care potentially the longest and most costly 
type 
more than half of all nursing home patients are admitted 
without having been hospitalized first but a majority of the 
longterm care policies checked required prior hospitalization 
before benefits could be provided 
alzheimers disease accounts for half of all nursing home 
patients yet a majority of the policies did not specifically state 
that it was covered 
a company flooded with claims could decide to use the vague 
language of its policies to exclude alzheimers coverage consumers 
union warned 
in addition the group noted that some policies require a 
confirmed diagnosis to provide coverage and alzheimers cannot 
always be confirmed except by autopsy

attorney general edwin meese iii faces new 
problems rebuilding a justice department rocked by resignations now 
that his second choice for the no 2 post has told him to find 
somebody else 
meese is looking for a new nominee after former american bar 
association president john shepherd told the attorney generals 
aides on monday to begin searching for a new candidate justice 
department sources say 
meese asked today whether shepherd had withdrawn said not 
yet i expect we will be hearing today or tomorrow meese 
declined comment when asked whether he was thinking of other names 
to suggest 
the attorney general was questioned as he left a memorial 
service for law enforcement officers slain while enforcing drug 
laws 
while department sources said shepherd had not flatly withdrawn 
they said he already had informed the department that he probably 
would do so the sources speaking only on condition of anonymity 
said shepherd asked that meeses aides begin looking for other 
candidates 
meeses problems in filling the post of deputy attorney general 
as well as the position of assistant attorney general in charge of 
the criminal division stem from the abrupt resignations march 30 
of arnold burns and criminal division chief william weld 
they quit out of concern that the nearly yearold criminal 
investigation of meese is hurting justice department operations 
morale and image 
a number of current and former us attorneys have been 
approached about taking welds post but all have turned it down 
department sources have said 
meese who testified before a federal grand jury for four hours 
in the probe monday has refused to resign predicting that he 
wont be indicted 
in an attempt to recover quickly from the resignations meese 
hurriedly announced the selection of shepherd for the no 2 
position two weeks ago without customary white house clearance and 
fbi background checks president reagan still has not nominated 
shepherd 
shepherd 62 a st louis attorney told meese last friday that 
he was giving serious consideration to withdrawing because of 
stress on his family stemming from his selection 
a former bookkeeper from shepherds law firm testified shortly 
before meese recommended him for the post that she had an affair 
with shepherd the bookkeeper who was convicted of embezzlement 
claimed shepherd had told her to write checks to herself shepherd 
denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her 
to write checs 
the trial testimony and shepherds membership in an allwhite 
country club and an allmale social club brought increasing public 
scrutiny of shepherd after meese announced his selection april 5 
meeses first choice to fill the post of deputy attorney general 
was former federal judge arlin adams now a philadelphia lawyer 
adams said he was unable to take the post because he had a heavy 
caseload and had gone to work at the law firm just last year adams 
said meeses legal problems were not a major factor in his decision 
not to take the justice department position 
meanwhile meese has gone outside the department in his attempt 
to fill welds old job at the head of the criminal division other 
justice department sources said 
stephen a saltzburg a university of virginia law professor 
has been sounded out about possibility of taking the job said the 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
reached at his home saltzburg said he hadnt been offered the 
job but would not comment when asked whether he had been 
approached about it 
saltzburg also is a consultant on a legal question in the 
irancontra prosecutions being conducted by independent counsel 
lawrence walsh 
saltzburg is a consultant to former federal judge and exus 
attorney herb stern stern was hired by walsh to represent the 
irancontra prosecutor on the issue of congressional immunity 
the legal question is whether or not the congressional testimony 
compelled by grants of immunity to former national security council 
staffer oliver north former national security adviser john 
poindexter and businessman albert hakim prejudice their fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination

the body of slain plo commander khalil 
alwazir was flown to damascus today for burial in the syrian 
capital in the absence of his lifetime comrade yasser arafat 
the 52yearold alwazir better known as abu jihad was 
assassinated saturday in a commando raid at his home outside the 
tunisian capital 
israeli sources have acknowledged that israel was responsible 
for alwazirs death but the government officials have not 
confirmed this 
the plane carrying alwazirs body arrived in the syrian capital 
at 245 pm after a flight from tunisia 
accompanying the body were alwazirs wife intisar his five 
children and senior palestine liberation organization officials 
including political department chief farouk kaddoumi executive 
committee member mahmoud abbas and the guerrilla movements 
security chief hayel abdelhamid 
arafat the plo chief saw the body off at tunis airport but 
stayed behind apparently because of his feud with president hafez 
assad of syria 
arafat and alwazir were expelled from damascus in june 1983 
after a syrianbacked mutiny in plo ranks 
the plo chiefs media adviser bassam abu sharif confirmed in a 
telephone interview with the associated press that arafat would not 
attend alwazirs funeral wednesday 
alwazir was born in ramle which is now in israel and had 
asked to be buried close to palestine his mother and father live 
in damascus 
abu sharif said another top plo leader salah khalaf better 
known as abu iyad also would not attend the funeral he too has 
not visited damascus since the plosyrian feud 
alwazir khalaf and arafat launched fatah the plos main 
guerrilla group in 1965 fatah accounts for more than 80 percent 
of the plos military strength 
the plo and the tunisian government have blamed israel for the 
murder of alwazir who reportedly masterminded palestinian rioting 
against israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza strip 
israeli sources speaking on condition of anonymity have 
privately acknowledged that the mossad intelligence service and the 
israeli navy cooperated in the assassination 
the tunisian government filed a complaint today with the un 
security council tunisian investigators said israel was behind the 
attack in which alwazir and two aides were killed 
tunisias ambassador to the united nations today requested an 
urgent meeting of the security council to condemn the assassination 
president zine el abidine ben ali of tunisia condemned the 
flagrant premeditated aggression against tunisian sovereignty 
the us government on monday sharply criticized alwazirs 
killing violence is not the solution to the problems of the 
middle east said state department spokesman charles e redman 
the tunisian investigators report said an israeli military 
boeing 707 was 34 miles outside tunisian air space at time of the 
attack 
the plane of the type used in the electronic war jammed 
communications in sidi bou said the northern suburb where wazir 
lived outside tunis the report said 
the terrorist group which assassinated the palestinian leader 
had sophisticated technological support which put this operation 
beyond the framework of normal terrorists and into the kind of 
terrorism that only states are in a position to practice the

chrysler corp negotiators asked the united auto 
workers today to support the automakers efforts to organize plant 
workers into teams and help avoid increased assembly costs 
the team plan would allow chrysler greater flexibility in using 
different workers for different jobs vice president anthony st 
john said after a second morning of meetings with the uaw on a new 
contract 
st john said chrysler the nations no 3 automaker wants 
modifications to a pattern contract adopted last year at ford motor 
co and general motors corp to help avoid cost increases 
chrysler wants to set a minimum retirement age to keep more 
workers active in their prime and increase the ratio of active 
workers to retirees st john said chrysler workers now retire as 
early as age 48 
adopting a minimum retirement age as well as encouraging 
workers to join prepaid health care plans would help keep 
chryslers percar production cost from going as much as 350 
above gms st john said 
uaw spokesman bob barbee said the union had no immediate comment 
on chryslers proposals 
on monday st john said chryslers senior executives will forgo 
bonuses in years when the no 3 automaker earns too little to share 
profits with workers 
the announcement came as the sides opened early talks on a 
contract covering 66000 workers in 15 states 
chrysler workers have no profitsharing formula under the 
current contract which expires sept 14 but union and company 
officials agree they will adopt an industrypattern agreement 
established last fall at gm and ford motor co that contains 
profitsharing 
union officials will study st johns announcement before 
commenting uaw spokesman peter laarman said calling it a free 
gift the kind you have to look at real close 
uaw leaders have blasted general motors corp the nations 
largest automaker for paying millions of dollars in cash bonuses 
or stock awards to executives in the past two years while saying 
its earnings were insufficient to distribute profits to workers 
there is a public perception that it is unfair and we tend 
to agree with that st john said 
in any year where profitsharing payments are not made to uaw 
employees the annual senior executive bonuses will also not be 
paid we intend to work through that issue in a commitment form 
with the uaw he said 
st john and uaw president owen bieber said they hope to reach a 
contract settlement in two to three weeks union bargainers 
presented their demands monday 
company negotiators were scheduled to present proposals today 
before the release of a company proxy statement likely to show that 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca again exercised stock options granted 
in the early 1980s when chryslers stock was worth a fraction of 
its present value 
in 1986 iacocca earned more than 20 million in salary 
benefits and exercised stock options 
the pattern contracts profitsharing formula resulted in a 
record 636 million distributed among 156000 ford workers last 
year ford profitsharing checks averaged about 4000 per worker 
bieber said pattern bargaining has always served our 
membership very well it has been a stabilizing force within the 
companies and between them 
st john also said chrysler wants to set up a committee of union 
and company officials and outside participants to track the new 
contracts ability to protect jobs and increase efficiency and 
quality at chrysler plants 
the committees findings would be used in drawing up a new 
contract in 1990 st john said apparently indicating chrysler 
will agree to the unions demand for a twoyear contract 
bieber and uaw vice president marc stepp said they want to put 
chryslers contract expiration back in synch with the gm and ford 
pacts so that in 1990 all three will expire together for the first 
time in a decade 
the talks which normally would begin in midjuly cover wages 
benefits and working conditions 
chryslers uaw contract covers 51600 hourly 5600 salaried and 
6000 laidoff workers at factories parts depots and offices in 
michigan ohio illinois massachusetts colorado alabama 
indiana california tennessee minnesota delaware new york

the executives of eastern airlines and its 
parent texas air corp lashed out at the unions today for a 
slanderous safety campaign and misinformation that they say 
has led to the government investigation into the airline company 
eastern today is the most watched airline in the business 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo told a news conference adding 
that he welcomed the government probes into eastern and continental 
airlines also part of his airline empire 
the ramp inspections ordered by the federal aviation 
administration will demonstrate once and for all that continental 
and eastern are as safe as any major airline said lorenzo 
what is at issue is how far a union is permitted to go by 
weakening a company through harassament and misinformation 
in part in an attempt to take over the company said lorenzo 
who vowed to keep eastern 
the company is not for sale lorenzo said adding that while 
he is aware of interests by some union leaders to launch a hostile 
takeover he has no concerete evidence of such a move 
officials from the unions representing easterns mechanics and 
pilots could not be reached immediately for comment on the charges 
they have said in the past that they are only trying to highlight 
efforts by lorenzo to weaken eastern 
the airline and the mechanics union are negotiating a contract 
in which the union has been resisting demands by management that it 
take significant wage concessions 
philip bakes president of eastern said that he is confident 
the federal investigation of eastern will conclude the airline is 
being operated safely he said federal inspectors have examined all 
of easterns jets at least once since the probe was announced last 
week and some planes have been examined five or six times as they 
operate in and out of different airports 
bakes accused the unions of a slanderous safety campaign 
which he said has been a major factor in recent financial 
losses by the airline 
while some eastern jets have been taken out of service after the 
inspections he characterized such actions as routine and proof 
that the system is working 
everyday planes are being taken out of service briefly as 
part of the airlines normal operations when they have mechanical 
or other problems 
texas air the countrys largest airline company has been 
reeling from a series of inspections announced last week by the faa 
and the transportation department into safety at the two airlines 
and the parent holding companys management and finances 
the news conference also was attended by two members of 
easterns board of directors and by frank borman who was easterns 
chairman before the airline was sold to texas air in 1986 and now 
remains on texas airs board of directors 
all of the executives blamed the labor turmoil at eastern for 
creating an atmosphere which prompted the unusual scrutiny of 
both the faa and its parent transportation department 
bakes said eastern is clearly being hurt by operating in an 
atmosphere of many myths but that the various federal 
investigations of eastern and texas air so far have had only a 
small impact on flight bookings at the airline 
obviously this isnt helping our business he said 
eastern meanwhile said it was launching an advertising 
campaign aimed at countering the attack on its image the aim of 
the ads as well as tuesdays news conference is to clear the 
air and set the record straight said clark onstad a texas 
air vice president

unreasonable fear of aids could cause a 
substantial disruption of the workplace unless employees are 
educated about how to deal with coworkers who have the fatal 
disease according to the results of a survey released tuesday by 
the american red cross 
the survey conducted by david m herold of the georgia 
institute of technology showed that of 2000 employees questioned 
across the country 42 percent said they would not work with anyone 
who has aids twentynine percent said they felt so strongly about 
it that they would quit their jobs before working with an aids 
patient 
herold said at a news conference at the american red cross 
national headquarters that there already have been incidents in 
which work came to a standstill as a result of unreasonable fear 
toward the immune deficiency disease 
he said a state government office in florida was shut down 
completely when a worker with aids became ill and vomited in his 
office maintenance workers refused to clean up the mess and 
coworkers refused to continue to work in the area the office was 
forced to close for the day he said 
a power company was forced to cancel a cardiopulminary 
resuscitation training program when workers said that they would 
not use the skill if they learned it because of their fear of aids 
he said cpr requires mouthtomouth breathing 
they the workers said that if anybody touched a live wire 
and got electrocuted they would just have to die because nobody 
would do cpr said herold 
he declined to identify the state government office or the 
utility company 
herold said that companies need to make policies now dealing 
with aidsinfected employees because it often is too late to make 
policies after the problem develops 
the passions run high when aids if found in the workplace 
said herold 
the american red cross announced that it has developed a program 
to help head off such problems through an aids education course 
offered to businesses for their employees 
called working beyond fear the course includes a video 
presentation and an instructor who can answer questions and promote 
discussion in meetings of employees said carole kauffman manager 
of the aids program at the red cross national headquarters 
ms kauffman said that more than a quarter million people are 
expected to be infected by the aids virus in the 1990s suggesting 
that aids in the workplace will become a growing issue 
it is conceivable that every business in america will be 
affected by aids said ms kauffman 
she said the training course will be offered by the 3000 red 
cross chapters in the country at a cost of 100 to 170 she said 
the course would be taught in the workplace and can be arranged by 
employers who call the local chapters 
the public relations society of america is assisting the red 
cross in promoting the program and representatives of both the 
aflcio and the us chamber of commerce attended the news 
conference tuesday to announce their endorsement of the course 
vincent r sombrotto who is president of the national 
association of letter carriers and an aflcio official said the 
unions support the aids training program because ignorance of the 
disease can be a greater problem than the disease itself 
aids is a contagious disease that destroys the immune system 
rendering the body incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections it is caused by a virus that most often is spread 
through close contact with blood blood products or semen from 
infected persons the disease currently is incurable and fatal 
its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases are attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of april 4 aids had been diagnosed in 58270 americans of 
whom more than half or 32545 have died since 1981 according to 
the centers for disease control

the supreme court on tuesday upheld the power 
of states to control gasoline prices and oil industry profits in a 
ruling that state officials say will help protect the public when 
there are energy crises 
the justices voted 80 to reinstate regulations in puerto rico 
that limit oil company profits and prevent an excise tax from being 
passed on to consumers 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the absence 
of specific federal legislation on gasoline regulation leaves the 
states free to adopt such rules 
the ruling treats puerto rico a commonwealth as though it were 
a state and applies to all states 
scalia rejected oil industry arguments that congress by 
eliminating gasoline controls mandated a free market in petroleum 
products 
there may be a general congressional desire favoring the 
free market he said 
but unenacted approval beliefs and desires are not laws 
scalia added without a text that can plausibly be 
interpreted as prescribing federal preemption of state power it 
is impossible to find that a free market was mandated by federal 
law 
the ruling was hailed by jeffrey c genzer general counsel to 
the national association of state energy officials 
the governors need the ability to respond quickly when there 
are energy shortages he said 
ive heard it a million times when theyre standing in gas 
lines or dont have enough home fuel people come to the governor 
or the state energy director not to the federal government for 
help he added 
genzer said the ruling may not have great immediate impact 
because there are no oil shortages now that require emergency state 
action 
but he said that without tuesdays decision states could be 
powerless for example to enforce socalled setaside programs 
requiring that a percentage of gasoline be reserved for 
toppriority needs when there are shortages most states have laws 
that give governors broad emergency powers to protect fuel supplies 
the supreme court ruling overturns a 1986 decision by a federal 
appeals court here that said congress intended to bar state 
regulation of the oil industry when it lifted controls on gasoline 
effective in 1981 
congress authorized the federal government in 1970 to place 
controls on petroleum products in an effort to curb inflation that 
law expired in 1973 
congress in the wake of an arab oil embargo then enacted an 
emergency law placing extensive price and allocation controls on 
gasoline 
that was followed in 1975 by a new law aimed at promoting oil 
conservation the 1975 law was amended later to provide for gradual 
deregulation and give the president sweeping authority to lift 
controls selectively 
complete deregulation by the federal government was required as 
of sept 30 1981 
puerto rico which previously had suspended its regulation of 
petroleum products while the federal controls were in effect 
placed an excise tax on oil refiners in 1986 
the puerto rico department of consumer affairs then issued 
regulations requiring advance notice of price increases 
prohibiting wholesalers from passing on the cost of the excise tax 
to retailers and imposing maximum profit margins on sales by 
wholesalers to retailers 
puerto ricos regulations challenged in a lawsuit by oil 
companies were supported by the reagan administration and state 
and local officials the national governors association the 
national association of counties and the us conference of mayors 
were among the groups that urged the supreme court to rule in favor 
of puerto rico 
justice sandra day oconnor did not take part in tuesdays 
ruling 
in other action the supreme court 
ruled 53 that the governments planned development of part 
of the six rivers national forest in california does not violate 
indians religious rights the decision revived the federal 
governments plans to harvest timber and improve a road in an area 
considered sacred by three tribes 
made it easier by an 81 vote in an oklahoma case for 
creditors to recover debts owed by a dead person by requiring 
generally that they be notified directly when the debtors will is 
reviewed in court 
ruled against a group of minnesota welfare recipients who said 
they were given inadequate notice about a change in their 
eligibility for federal benefits the 53 ruling said states are 
not required to provide advance written notice about the effects of 
1981 changes in eligibility requirements of the aid to families 
with dependent children program

a court convicted abbas hamadi 
on tuesday of abducting two west germans as ransom for his brother 
mohammed who is accused of hijacking a twa jetliner 
abbas hamadi 29 was sentenced to 13 years in prison after 
being found guilty on all charges of kidnapping coercion and 
possession of explosives 
it is totally reprehensible to rob two innocent people of 
their freedom and make them fear for their lives chief judge 
arend said in explaining the sentence he and his four colleagues 
meted out to hamadi 
the 13year term was 18 months longer than the prosecution 
requested the maximum allowed was 15 years 
hamadi who is bearded and wore a sport coat and opennecked 
shirt slumped into his chair after hearing the verdict and 
remained silent more than 100 spectators most of them reporters 
were in the room 
mohammed hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport jan 13 1987 
and abbas 13 days later both with explosives in their possession 
mohammed hamadi is accused in the june 1985 hijacking of a twa 
jetliner to beirut in which a us navy diver was killed and 39 
americans were held hostage for 17 days 
both hamadis were living in west germany at the time of their 
arrests after mohammed hamadi was jailed but while his brother 
was free two west germans were kidnapped in beirut rudolf cordes 
on jan 17 and alfred schmidt on jan 20 
schmidt was released in september but cordes remains a hostage 
arend said the evidence proved abbas hamadi was among radical 
shiite moslems who plotted the kidnappings to try to block mohammed 
hamadis extradition to the united states west germany has refused 
extradition and assigned mohammed hamadis case to juvenile court 
for trial 
in washington deputy state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said we commend todays action by the west german court 
which sends a clear signal to terrorists 
defense lawyer eckart hild said he would appeal and told 
reporters i do not find this judgment at all convincing abbas 
hamadi denied involvement in the kidnappings but admitted storing 
explosives near his home in saarland state for his younger brother 
the chief judge said in court after the arrest of mohammed 
hamadi the group in beirut considered whether to attack the west 
german embassy in lebanon hijack a german airliner or kidnap a 
german citizen and decided on kidnapping 
an older hamadi brother abdulhadi also was among the 
plotters arend said he is security chief in beirut for hezbollah 
party of god a shiite moslem group allied with iran 
in the 3month trial of abbas hamadi the court heard tapped 
telephone conversations between him and lebanese friends in west 
germany indicating he was among the plotters a compelling piece of 
evidence was a letter schmidt sent to his mother from captivity 
that bore hamadis fingerprints 
there is no doubt the fingerprints are those of abbas 
hamadi arend said 
he said evidence showed the defendant acted as an interpreter 
during questioning of the hostaged soon after their abductions 
abbas hamadi has spent several years in west germany and is fluent 
in the language but was in beirut when schmidt and cordes were 
kidnapped 
abbas hamadi threatened schmidt at one point while holding a gun 
and also struck him with his hand arend said 
the accused demanded that schmidt hand over the addresses of 
other germans in beirut which indicating the kidnappers were 
seeking more victims the judge declared 
schmidt testified at the trial that he and cordes were chained 
to a wall for four months 
animals should not be treated the way the hostages have been 
treated arend said looking directly at hamadi 
he said hezbollah planned to take the explosives stored near 
abbas hamadis home to france for terrorist acts the judge did not 
elaborate 
according to arend evidence showed abbas hamadi also was guilty 
of coercion that charge stemmed from the kidnappers threat to 
kill their hostages if mohammed hamadi was given to the united 
states 
west germany rejected the extradition request last year and said 
he would be tried here 
no trial date has been set for mohammed hamadi whose case was 
turned over to juvenile court prosecutors files show he now is 
23 but judicial officials say there is some question about his age 
at the time the hijacking was planned

construction of singlefamily homes rose 
sharply in march for the second consecutive month the government 
said tuesday offering evidence of a healthy building season this 
spring 
however a steep decline in apartment construction held the 
overall level of housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 154 million units in march a modest 19 percent increase 
over the previous month the commerce department said 
mark obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings 
institutions said the march increase coupled with an overall 96 
percent jump in february provide evidence that housing has 
recovered from its slump in december and january 
housing starts plummeted 158 percent in december the sharpest 
monthly decline in more than three years and drifted another 12 
percent lower in january analysts attributed the decline to 
builders fear that the october stock market crash would dampen 
home buying and to the precrash buildup in mortgage interest rates 
whatever problems there might have been in the worst of the 
winter months housing seems to have recovered pretty much 
obrinsky said its not going to be a boom year for housing but 
the decline from last year should be pretty moderate 
housing construction hit an eightyear high of 181 million 
units in 1986 and fell 10 percent in 1987 analysts are projecting 
another 4 percent to 8 percent decline this year 
lyle gramley chief economist of the mortgage bankers 
association of america said lower interest rates strong 
employment gains and the rebound in consumer confidence after the 
crash are the ingredients we need for a good spring buying 
season 
however he warned we have to anticipate that rising mortgage 
interest rates will lead to a tailing off in the second half of the 
year 
rates for 30year fixedrate mortgages which shot up above 
115 percent before the stock market crash dipped below 10 percent 
in february and march before rising to 1019 percent last week 
economists are projecting rates of about 11 percent by the end of 
the year 
housing permits considered a good sign of future economic 
activity also rose in march moving up 21 percent to an annual 
rate of 145 million units 
the strength in starts last month came in construction of 
singlefamily housing which rose 71 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 118 million units after an even stronger 
89 percent climb in february 
construction of multifamily units fell 123 percent to an 
annual rate of 358000 units the construction of buildings with 
five or more units was at its lowest rate since june 1982 during 
the last recession 
apartment construction has been in a slump because the new tax 
law passed in 1986 removed many of the tax shelter benefits of 
investing in real estate also the old law had encouraged 
overbuilding in some areas 
multifamily housing starts are in a range that we are going 
to have to get used to for most of this year and perhaps much of 
next year until vacancy rates come down said martin a regalia 
chief economist of the national council of savings institutions 
regionally the west posted the strongest gain in march 187 
percent starts also rose in the midwest by 27 percent housing 
starts fell 58 percent in the south and 35 percent in the 
northeast

the third fullscale firing of a 
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket for the space shuttle was 
scheduled for wednesday with deliberate flaws built in to test 
safety features 
the twominute firing of the 126footlong 12 millionpound 
booster was scheduled for 3 pm edt at morton thiokols wasatch 
operations plant 25 miles west of brigham city 
this is a really important milestone in the resumption of 
flight said company spokesman rocky raab in a sense its the 
culmination of the redesign effort of two years if all three of 
the final tests proceed satisfactorily the launch preparations 
proceed 
the horizontal test is designed to reveal any weaknesses in 
booster which was redesigned after the jan 28 1986 explosion of 
the shuttle challenger 
the disaster which killed challengers sevenmember crew was 
blamed on a flawed booster rocket seal that allowed blazing exhaust 
to escape through a joint in the side and ignite the shuttles 
external liquid fuel tank 
wednesdays test is the first in the last series of firings 
planned by morton thiokol and nasa before the shuttles first 
postchallenger launch scheduled for midaugust other fullscale 
tests are scheduled for june and july 
the rocket for wednesdays test was assembled with deliberate 
flaws in sealing material in the joints between segments of the 
booster flawed seals have been tested previously in shortduration 
tests but never in a fullscale firing raab said 
in one joint a defect was cut into the surface of a jshaped 
seal where sections of insulation meet inside the rocket casing 
the defect could let hot gas penetrate the insulation and hit the 
innermost of three orings in the shortduration tests the defect 
sealed itself during firing and gas did not reach the oring 
in another joint a small blowhole was created in the 
adhesive that binds the insulation to the rocket casing in 
shortduration tests hot gases have followed the blowhole to a new 
oring but have not gone beyond it 
the test comes at a critical time for morton thiokol the 
company is nasas sole supplier of booster rockets and views a 
successful launch as a sign the stigma of the challenger tragedy 
can be set aside 
while praising morton thiokols work in the redesign effort 
nasa also has asked congress for a 12 million government plant to 
build its own boosters 
though not related to the shuttle program the companys image 
also was tarnished by the deaths of five employees in a dec 29 
fire that destroyed a firststage mx missile rocket motor 
state safety inspectors cited morton thiokol for alleged safety 
violations which are being contested by the company 
but both air force and morton thiokol investigators concluded 
the workers violated company safety rules by being in the building 
during a critical stage of the fueling process that normally is 
carried out by remote control 
raab said confidence at the company remains high 
the morale here is extremely good as far as the redesign and 
success weve had to date raab said what most people dont 
realize is this redesign effort is about three times as intricate 
as the original design process and is being completed in half the 
time

an explosion at the americancosta 
rican cultural center injured six people on tuesday police and 
us embassy spokesmen said 
at least two of the injured were seriously hurt officials said 
first police reports said it appeared that a bomb or grenade 
had been thrown against the center but there were later reports 
the blast occurred in an electric transformer 
the force of the explosion broke windows in nearby cars 
us embassy spokesman mark krischick said preliminary 
information available to us is that it was not a bomb but a 
malfunction of electrical equipment on a power line 
he said he based that conclusion on statements from police 
embassy workers and witnesses and on the types of injuries 
sustained 
the cultural center is sponsored by the us embassy

state marine biologists plan to salt the waters off 
the florida keys this summer with 10000 baby queen conchs in hopes 
of rebuilding the population of shellfish that gave the keys their 
nickname the conch republic 
the goal is a conch population large enough to allow private and 
commercial fisherman to again harvest the key ingredient for conch 
chowder and conch fritters 
its unknown if the yearold seedlings raised under controlled 
conditions will survive in keys waters 
hopefully our project will be the start of a continuous 
seeding program in which we will be putting 50000 conch into the 
water each year said carl berg who heads the florida department 
of natural resources seeding project 
queen conch had become so rare in the keys two years ago that 
former state rep joe allen of key west obtained a state ban on 
harvesting and a 265000 grant for the reseeding program 
overharvesting was the main reason the shellfish were 
endangered in south florida 
since the ban most of the conch meat has been shipped to miami 
from places such as honduras colombia and haiti last year 
according to berg 173 million pounds were imported about 8 
million conchs 
each of the seedlings has been tagged so its progress can be 
monitored berg said it takes three to four years for a conch to 
reach maturity

president reagan appealed to congress on 
tuesday to send our own message to people who kill cops by 
passing legislation providing for the death penalty for the slaying 
of officers enforcing drug laws 
the president spoke at a memorial ceremony for police officers 
and others who have lost their lives in the line of duty while 
investigating illegal drug trafficking 
six months ago i sent to congress legislation which says that 
when narcotics racketeers kill and are convicted they will face 
execution reagan said 
he said the house approved similar legislation in 1986 but 
neither the house nor senate judiciary committees has taken up his 
measure this year 
it is time to back up the rhetoric on the drug problem with 
action and i call on the house and senate to vote promptly on my 
bill providing for capital punishment when a death results from 
drug dealing and when a drug enforcement administration or other 
law enforcement officer is murdered the president said 
when drug syndicates commit murder our sympathy should be 
with the victims not the killers he said its time for us to 
send our own message to people who kill cops 
reagan also said that liberal politicians and others who took a 
permissive attitude toward drugs in the 1960s share the blame for 
the deaths of officers enforcing the drug laws now 
some liberal politicians decried our restrictions on drugs as 
conservative moralistic reactionary and old fashioned or simply 
remained silent that there even was a drug problem he said 
many universities adopted a handsoff attitude toward 
socalled recreational drug use and the entertainment industry 
produced films and music that promoted and legitimized drug use 
reagan said 
the truth was that drugs are killers but for nearly a 
generation this vital message was ignored by a whole group of 
people who should have known better 
the leaders of that destructive generation remain the 
forgotten accomplices in the epidemic of illegal drug use he 
said they cannot escape blame when a law enforcement officer 
dies in the battle 
the ceremony held in a white house office building was 
attended by law enforcement officers families of slain officers 
and members of congress 
at one point reagan led the group in a moment of silence and 
then said amen we rededicate ourselves to continue their 
struggle 
first lady nancy reagan who has campaigned actively against 
drug use joined her husband on the platform but did not speak 
jose martinez a federal drug enforcement agent who was wounded 
during a heroin investigation near los angeles in which two of his 
colleagues were killed told the group that his fellow agents 
were victims of societys demand to satisfy their desire for 
drugs 
not until people quit using drugs will it become safe for 
those of us in law enforcement and the rest of society martinez 
said

the federal election commission fined 
president reagans campaign committee 10000 for accepting 
excessive contributions in the 1984 primary election newly 
released records show 
the commission is winding up its work on the 1984 election and 
documents released monday include a jan 26 settlement signed by 
the reagan committee 
an audit by the fec found that reagan accepted more than the 
1000 maximum from 285 individuals for a total of 193674 in 
excess receipts 
of that the campaign transferred 172624 into a fund used to 
comply with various fec regulations in the general election but 
such a transfer is legal only if the donors give written 
permission which was not obtained in the case of reagans 
campaign the commission report said 
most of the rest of the money was refunded to the donors 
although not within a reasonable time according to the 
settlement agreement signed by the fec and the reagan committee 
treasurer angela buchanan jackson 
five thousand dollars was later listed in the names of spouses 
of original donors but that procedure too requires written 
authorization from the contributors and spouses and the 
authorization was not given 
spending and contribution limits apply to all candidates who 
receive federal matching funds for their presidential campaigns 
the two party nominees for the general election receive all 
their campaign funds from the federal pot and do not have to raise 
any money on their own in the primary elections however they 
must raise money privately that can be matched from the federal 
fund 
the fund is supported by the voluntary 1 checkoff on income tax 
returns 
this year the fec will give the democratic and republican 
nominees 27 million each for the general election campaign

a polka dot dress bullets taken from 
victims and a handscrawled notation that rfk must die were 
among pieces of evidence put on display today as officials opened 
secret records on the assassination of robert f kennedy 
the exhibits mounted on boards and in glass cases were samples 
of the voluminous files examined by state archivists and were put 
on display to illustrate key points in the investigation as 
authorities released the material 
the police files on kennedys shooting could shed new light on 
persistent questions about whether sirhan bishara sirhan was the 
only gunman in the shooting 
was kennedy shot from in front or behind were there eight shots 
or more in the pantry of the ambassador hotel and how close was 
the gunman whose bullet found its fatal path into kennedys brain 
those questions and others raised by conspiracy theorists and 
scholars may be addressed in some 50000 pages of documents 
interviews with 4000 witnesses and 2500 photographs being 
released today by california secretary of state march fong eu 
it has been almost 20 years since that awful night at the 
ambassador hotel a night which ended one life and changed so 
many others eu said as she formally ordered the materials made 
public 
among the disputed facts verified by the documents was an 
admission by police that they destroyed key evidence in the case 
including ceiling tiles a door jamb and thousands of photographs 
taken in the ambassador hotel kitchen where kennedy was shot on 
june 5 1968 
an official record in the evidence showed that 2410 photographs 
were burned on aug 21 1968 it gives no reason for their burning 
the polka dot dress was one of many purchased by police in an 
effort to jog the memories of witnesses on a point of contention 
whether a girl in a polka dot dress was seen running from the 
ambassador hotel shouting we shot him that report was never 
verified 
one entire case of evidence contained items from sirhans 
pasadena home among the items was the nowfamous diary in which 
sirhan scrawled in pencil his plans to kill the new york senator 
my determination to eliminate rfk is becoming more the more of 
an unshakeable obsession he wrote under a series of doodles was 
the statement rfk must die 
also included was signin sheet from a san gabriel valley gun 
club which showed that sirhan visited there on june 4 1968 
the key question is whether sirhan a jordanian immigrant 
serving a life sentence for the crime was the lone assassin of the 
democratic presidential hopeful 
on the eve of the release of the files sirhans attorney luke 
mckissack said sirhan expects nothing to contradict his 
frequentlystated claim that he was a lone gunman 
mckissack said that although sirhan maintains he doesnt 
remember shooting kennedy sirhan believes he was motivated by 
anger over the arab loss in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
mckissack said that sirhan who is serving his sentence at 
soledad prison has given up hope that he will ever be paroled 
eu and california archivist john burns say they hope the release 
of the los angeles police department investigative file will 
satisfy the publics right to know everything about the event 
there should no longer be any speculation about what the 
police found burns said 
the release follows years of demands for public access to the 
information 
this is a kind of vindication of citizens efforts to force 
this material out said gregory stone a political scientist on 
leave from the university of wisconsin who has devoted himself to 
studying kennedys killing 
stone equated its importance with the 1964 publication of the 
warren commissions investigation of the assassination of president 
john f kennedy robert kennedys brother 
the only things withheld from disclosure eu said were autopsy 
photos criminal rap sheets and fingerprint cards juvenile 
case records internal police personnel records and records that 
originated with the fbi or police departments outside los angeles 
burns said the fbi would release its own file at an unspecified 
time 
eus spokeswoman melissa warren said her office had been 
inundated with calls since announcing the impending release 
including many from massachusetts kennedys home state and new 
york which he represented as a us senator 
a summary of los angeles police department files released in 
1986 contained a police conclusion tht sirhan was the lone 
assassin it found no evidence of a second gunman or a conspiracy 
sirhan admitted the killing at his 1969 trial but has claimed he 
has no memory of the actual shooting he blames his memory loss on 
alcohol 
names and details considered sensitive at the time were deleted 
from the 1986 summary it did not fully address questions raised 
about forensic evidence involving the gun autopsy reports and 
witness recollections 
witnesses told of seeing sirhan step from behind a steam table 
into kennedys path as the senator walked toward him but los 
angeles county coroner thomas noguchi testified at sirhans trial 
that kennedy was killed by a shot fired behind his right ear 
conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at 
kennedy from behind while sirhan stood in front of him

whistled past the warships 
adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told 
president reagan and republican congressional leaders that there 
was no evidence iran had fired any silkworms white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
in avoiding the missiles the threeship convoy led by the uss 
jack williams took evasive action and fired chaff into the air 
which confused the rockets radar guidance system and caused the 
missiles to miss the convoy in the southern gulf

iranian forces since the us navy sent its task force to the gulf 
last year 
reagan today said the gulf seems to be quieting down

11 us reflagged kuwaiti tankers sailing under us navy 
protection were discontinued until a major shipping channel further 
north was cleared

the pentagon said monday that us raids on the iranian oil 
platforms came in retaliation for a mine strike last thursday 
against the uss samuel b roberts which injured 10 crewmen 
iran said several people were killed or injured in the raids on 
the two oil platforms but gave no further details it has denying 
planting the mines

michael dukakis seeking signs of things to 
come squared off against jesse jackson in a raucous new york 
primary tuesday as he bid for control over the race for the 1988 
democratic presidential nomination 
jackson hoped for an upset that would propel his candidacy 
through the final six weeks of primaries while sen albert gore 
jr struggled simply to survive 
new yorks millions rendered their primary verdict while 
democratic senators met behind closed doors in the capitol to 
select 43 delegates to the partys national convention dukakis won 
13 pledges and outdueled gore who gained six as well as his own 
jackson was shut out with the majority of senators remaining 
uncommitted 
vice president george bush was the winner for sure on the 
republican ballot with no serious opposition in new york or 
elsewhere new york offered 96 delegates for the vice president 
steadily closing in on the 1139 needed to secure his nomination at 
the republican national convention in august 
new york was the biggest singlestate primary night so far this 
year offering 255 delegates and a shining opportunity for dukakis 
to assert control over the democratic race hed won two primaries 
and two caucuses since his stinging defeat to jackson in michigan 
three weeks ago 
in the next few weeks dukakis primary prospects appeared 
bright new york offered jackson an unusually high percentage of 
black voters that wont be available to him in upcoming states and 
already there was talk of gore skipping pennsylvania next week 
that would leave dukakis as the only white candidate in the race 
dukakis began the day leading in the competition for national 
convention delegates the associated press count showed the 
massachusetts governor with 880 delegates to 745 for jackson and 
419 for gore it takes 2082 to gain the nomination at the party 
convention 
the new york primary campaign proved to be a ferocious affair 
that exposed deep racial and religious divisions among new yorkers 
featuring an almost daily tonguelashing from mayor ed koch 
directed at jackson 
jackson sought to remain above the fray although he said on the 
day before the primary that we have received more death threats 
in this campaign than in all the other combined because the climate 
has been so divisive and so violent 
jackson hailed a solid victory over dukakis in the delaware 
caucuses on monday and said it was a sign of things to come 
delaware was the hors doeuvre new york is a fourcourse meal 
he said he campaigned through the morning of primary day in hopes 
of boosting turnout in predominantly black areas in new york city 
where his support was strongest 
dukakis greeted morning commuters at a subway stop in queens in 
new york city before returning to massachusetts to spend the day 
gore was a distant third in public opinion surveys despite a 
costly effort designed to reinvigorate a campaign that has been 
moribund since super tuesday six weeks ago he spent primary 
morning campaigning in new york as aides passed the word that they 
expected the senator to gain less than 10 percent of the new york 
vote a performance that would raise questions about his ability 
to continue 
dukakis normally the most cautious of candidates predicted in 
the final hours of the new york campaign that he would score a 
victory that would place him firmly on the path toward the 
nomination 
its been a terrific exciting interesting couple of weeks 
and i hope if all goes well today a sign of things to come he 
said 
interesting hardly began to describe the multimillion dollar 
campaign to appeal to the states many and farflung ethnic and 
religious groups the states two prominent democrats captured 
their share of the limelight koch endorsed gore when he wasnt 
attacking jackson and gov mario cuomo declined to endorse anyone 
while finally ruling out accepting a draft

at times it seemed dukakis jackson and gore were mere 
bystanders peering into the everbubbling new york political 
cauldron 
cuomo played the role of emcee meeting with jackson and 
dukakis speaking nicely of them as well as gore but not endorsing 
anyone 
some divined a preference for dukakis when cuomo urged party 
leaders to express a preference for a candidate many of them 
flocked to the massachusetts governors side 
but there was confusion aplenty when the governor and his aides 
offered multiple explanations of whether he would accept a draft at 
the party nomination convention asked if he would utter a simple 
yes or no answer to the question he replied yes or no 
koch provided much of the fireworks first saying that jews 
would have to be crazy to vote for jackson then saying that 
the former civil rights leader under stress is not capable of 
telling the truth 
gore who ardently sought kochs backing in hopes of cutting 
into dukakis support among jews and other residents of new york 
city declared by the end of the campaign that the mayor was 
speaking for himself 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin returned fire koch 
he said is a lunatic 
dukakis wanted none of that fight but he had trials of his own 
he was upbraided at one campaign stop in harlem for not doing

a citizens group concerned that a new type 
of discrimination will evolve once scientists have cracked the 
human genetic code proposed tuesday that a federal commission be 
established to advise on how to control the new gene technology 
jeremy rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends 
and an active opponent of some biological research projects said 
he is organizing the citizens group as a result of plans for the 
government to finance research that would map the human genetic 
code 
the genetic code forms the blueprint for all human physical 
characteristics it determines why some people have blue eyes and 
blond hair and others have brown hair and brown eyes it also 
gives a predisposition for some illnesses and disabilities 
rifkin said that once the genetic code or genome is known 
there is a possibility that this will be used by employers 
insurance companies and others to discriminate against people whose 
genetic make up includes potential diseasecausing defects 
a new kind of discrimination will arise not based on skin 
color but on genetic makeup rifkin said at a news conference 
we dont want to see the emergence of a commercial genetic 
discrimination in this country 
rifkin said his group is proposing that organizing and financing 
a citizens commission on genetic ethics be a part of any 
legislation that would finance research on the human genome 
earlier this year the national academy of sciences proposed that 
the government finance a 3 billion effort to map the function of 
the 100000 genes that make up the human genetic code the project 
is now being considered by congress 
rifkin said funds should not be provided for the scientific 
research unless money also is appropriated to control the 
application of knowledge developed by the technical research 
without such controls he said we face the very real 
possibility of a new form of eugenics in this country eugenics 
is the concept of improving the human species by controlling 
hereditary factors through controlled mating or through genetics 
rifkin said some legislators have agreed to introduce 
legislation requiring the genetics advisory board but he declined 
to name sponsors of the legislation 
he said the commission is supported by what he said were 70 
prominent national leaders of civil rights labor disability 
rights and religious groups seven representatives from those 
groups attended the news conference 
deborah kaplan a california attorney and a disability rights 
activists said the genetics research could be used by employers to 
exclude some people from jobs she said many disabled workers now 
are denied jobs for medical reasons and the genetic technology 
could provide more sophisticated means of screening people out of 
jobs that they could do 
this would be done she said by labeling people based on their 
genetic potential for illness or disability 
there are too many labels now she said and this will 
give us still more labels we can apply to people 
rabbi david saperstein representing a washington center of 
reform judaism said new knowledge such as the genetic code must be 
carefully applied because there no longer is room for technological 
error 
this is the first generation of humanity that does not have 
the benefit of making mistakes in applying technology he said 
all of human history is a test run for this moment 
he said that because of the eugenics experiments conducted on 
jews by the nazis in world war ii his religious community is 
particularly sensitive to the application of new genetic knowledge 
rifkin said the proposed commission to be called the human 
genome policy board would comprise 12 members six each selected 
by the house and the senate he said the board would appoint a 
committee of 18 that broadly would represent all special interest 
groups concerned with issues of genetics 
he said the proposal would include an appropriation of 35 
million to finance the work of the board and the committee

the warning silkworm 
incoming blared five times from the bridge of the uss jack 
williams but all five iranian missiles missed the threeship us 
navy attack group 
the missiles flew from irans antiship missile batteries monday 
as the navy attacked two iranian oil platforms in the southern 
persian gulf in retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in a us 
frigate last week 
officers on the williams which led the surface action 
group identified the missiles as chinesebuilt silkworms but the 
pentagon and adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff did not confirm it the pentagon said tuesday it was still 
analyzing the attack 
with the first warning of silkworm incoming the jack 
williams lurched into violent maneuvers and crewmen scrambled 
everybody look astern everybody look astern lt augustino 
ponturier officer of the deck shouted to junior officers and 
lookouts 
the guided missile frigate rolled sharply and pointed its stern 
toward the approaching missile presenting its smallest target and 
allowing the aluminumchaff launchers and other defensive weapons a 
clear shot 
none of the first four rockets came close enough to be seen but 
members of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck as the 
fifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oil rig 
with an orangeyellow flash 
officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system 
not one of these ladies has a scratch on her and the other 
guys cant say that said capt don dyer operational commander 
of the force 
in all six iranian ships were damaged by us fire monday 
dyer said a c130 aircraft spotting targets for the iranian 
batteries was tracked by us jets from the nuclearpowered 
aircraft carrier enterprise and was almost shot down 
us officials reported one us helicopter with two crew 
members aboard missing monday and the search continued tuesday 
they denied iranian claims that the aircraft was shot down 
the williams with members of a pentagon news media pool aboard 
was the operational flagship for one of the three surface action 
groups involved in the fighting monday in the southern gulf also 
in the group were the destroyers joseph strauss and obrien 
mondays operations began when us warships destroyed two 
iranian oil platforms 
over the next few hours navy forces sank two missilearmed 
patrol boats damaged two others and bombed and rocketed two 
frigates 
one of the iranian frigates the sahand was hit by a harpoon 
missile fired from the strauss 
the white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke and 
streaked for the horizon the men on the williams bridge cheered 
yeah yeah yeah 
a flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon followed by a 
long series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunition 
aboard the sahand blew up 
lt cmdr mark van dyke a spokesman for the navys joint task 
force middle east said a us pilot who observed the sahand 
reported it listing badly with a big hole in its port side the 
superstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in the 
water 
soon afterward f14 jet fighters from the enterprise attacked 
the sahands sister frigate sabalan after it fired a missile at 
them 
us army maj barry willey a central command officer 
accompanying the media pool described the view from the williams 
bridge as both spectacular and frightening contrails from 
missiles could be seen in almost every direction 
the oil platform attacks were aimed at what us officials 
called military targets both the sassan and sirrid platforms have 
been used by for military purposes they say 
president reagan ordered the strikes after the frigate samuel b 
roberts hit a mine which us officials say was laid by iran in 
the central gulf last thursday ten crewman were wounded 
while other groups attacked the platforms the williams unit 
steamed halfway through the strait or hormuz in calm seas under 
clear skies within range of iranian silkworm batteries that had not 
yet been used in the southern gulf 
van dyke said the mission was to exercise the right of 
innocent transit passage and respond to all contingencies 
thats when the missiles came 
as the williams and its accompanying warships sailed out of the 
silkworm envelope later monday into safer waters and a setting 
sun the alert level was lowered from general quarters to the 
next lowest condition onealpha 
ponturier of red bank nj took off his steel helmet and 
walked toward the door its miller time he said

president reagan might veto a massive trade 
bill now before congress but that action wouldnt directly affect 
the freetrade agreement between the united states and canada 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said tuesday 
theres nothing that tells me that theyre connected lyng 
said if there is a veto of the sweeping trade bill reagans veto 
message would describe some reasons that have nothing whatsoever 
to do with the free trade agreement with canada as far as i can 
see 
lawmakers are near final action on the 1000page trade bill 
but there have been veto threats over parts the administration find 
objectionable including a provision that would require 60day 
notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
the uscanada trade pact was signed jan 2 but still requires 
approval by the canadian parliament and the us congress if 
approved the treaty will take effect jan 1 1989 and will 
gradually eliminate all tariffs between the two countries and 
address nontariff barriers 
according to the agriculture department uscanada trade was 
about 124 billion in 1986 of which 46 billion was agricultural 
lyng appeared at a news conference with canadian minister of 
agriculture john wise following private discussions wise said he 
was pleased by lyngs view of the trade bill and said there is 
the absolute need and the absolute necessity for us to join 
forces in ongoing global talks under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade or gatt 
in fact i think were it not for the leadership taken by 
canada and the united states we probably wouldnt be at the 
stage that we are now in the uruguay round of multinational trade 
negotiations wise said 
both he and lyng said the uscanada freetrade agreement would 
help push the cause of global reform 
it would be extremely helpful i think to both of us in 
sending a very legitimate and a very concrete message to our other 
trading partners particularly at gatt wise said 
in a joint statement later the two agricultural leaders pledged 
to work together to ensure that the organization for economic 
cooperation and development ministerial meeting in may and the 
toronto economic summit in june provide the necessary political 
impetus for a midterm review of the uruguay round next december

defense secretary frank carlucci refused to 
specutlate today on the fate of a marine helicopter and its twoman 
crew missing since american encounters monday with iranian forces 
in the persian gulf 
nor would he comment on irans claims that its forces had 
brought the craft down 
carlucci asked as he left a memorial service for police 
officers and others killed enforcing drug laws whether the copter 
was considered lost answered 
im not going to speculate were continuing to look and im 
certainly hopeful 
asked about iranian claims that its forces had shot the 
helicopter down carlucci replied im not going to get into the 
details 
the marine corps meanwhile changed the status of the 
helicopters two crewmen to missing 
pentagon spokesman dan howard identified them as capt stephen 
c leslie 30 and capt kenneth w hill 33 assigned to squadron 
hmla167 based at the new river nc marine corps air station 
leslie claims a home of record of new bern and hill a home of 
record of thomasville nc the pentagon said 
howard repeated statements of monday that the cobra had been 
sent out on a standard patrol sweep and that there was no 
evidence to suggest the copter had ever come under fire 
as he commented us navy ships and planes continued to search 
for the marine cobra attack helicopter over the central gulf 
the helicopter did not return to the uss wainwright monday after 
what pentagon officials called a routine reconnaissance mission 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported monday 
night that iranian warships in a heroic clash with the aggressor 
american helicopters in the persian gulf shot down one of them 
monday afternoon

european leaders tuesday denounced minelaying in 
the persian gulf while prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
went further and delivered a strong defense of us retaliatory 
action against iran 
im in favor of action against those who lay mines against 
shipping in the gulf and not letting people get away with 
constantly causing extra trouble on what should be a free 
international seaway mrs thatcher told parliament adding 
i fully support the action which the united states took 
a french government spokesman said paris is concerned by the 
sudden renewal of tension in the gulf 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said we reaffirm our 
commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf and demand that the 
mining stop along with all other acts hostile to navigation in 
international waters 
in reply to a question he said attacks on merchant shipping 
can only lead to measures of selfdefense 
italian foreign minister giulio andreotti said laying mines 
is an illegal act which puts navigation at risk he said the 
us attack on an iranian oil platform and an iranian 
counterattack correspond with the hard logic of military action 
and reaction 
an iranian diplomat said the accusation that his country planted 
the mines was such an absurd thing that one does not have to deny 
it he implied iraq was the culprit because disruption of gulf 
shipping served iraqi interests 
it was iraq that attacked the shipping in the persian gulf 
and invited foreign forces to the area in order to divert the 
attention from the main problem on the battleground said 
akhunzadeh basti the iranian charge daffaires in london in a 
british broadcasting corp radio interview 
asked whether iran would attack us targets again he replied 
by these actions they america openly committed themselves or 
they made an alliance with the iraqis so we see now the americans 
are directly supporting iraq in a defeated war and if that is their 
position of course there will be countermeasures 
basti was summoned to by british foreign office official alan 
munro who protested about the mining and irans attack on the york 
marine a britishowned tanker on lease to a us company 
in west germany the leftleaning frankfurter rundschau 
newspaper said that militarily washington can be satisfied with 
the results of the attacks against two iranian oil platforms in the 
gulf 
however it said in another way the attack did not work as 
planned in washington because iran responded to the action by 
attacking the york marine 
this means a dangerous escalation of the already tense 
situation between the united states and iran in the gulf and 
confirms the fears of congress that the united states could be 
drawn into a broad military conflict in the gulf the paper said

a soviet newspaper on tuesday blamed high infant 
mortality in the central asian republic of turkmenia on widespread 
incest among rural residents who intermarry to avoid paying huge 
dowries demanded by tradition 
the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda quoted a doctor in the 
village of yagtylyk as saying that at one nearby collective farm 
there are 90 families in which the parents are close relatives and 
71 of them had borne children who died within a year 
the newspaper did not make clear how much of the republics high 
incidence of infant mortality was attributable to incest but said 
it was a high percentage 
a soviet sociology journal last year reported that the infant 
mortality rate in turkmenia is more than twice the soviet national 
average which itself ranks 50th in the world behind most 
developed countries 
the journal sociological research said 582 of every 1000 
children born in the central asian republic die within a year the 
national infant mortality rate in the soviet union in 1986 was 254 
per 1000 infant mortality in the united states that year was 104 
per 1000 births 
they knock us doctors for the high infant mortality rate 
khodzhamurad makhemov a pediatric specialist in turkmenias 
takhtinsky region told the newspaper yet we are powerless in the 
case of the death of a child of related parents 
the report referred to the case of a 30yearold woman in the 
region who married her first cousin and gave birth to eight 
children five of them died before reaching age one 
komsomolskaya pravda said 164 cases of infant mortality 
attributable to incest had been found in the one village yagtylyk 
the population of which was not given and is too small to be 
included in the annual national economic report the article 
speculated however that a similar situation existed throughout 
the rural regions of the republic of about 33 million people 
intermarriage in the republic has not fallen off in recent 
years the newspaper said blaming the practice on those who 
support dowry ransoms the buying and selling of turkmenian girls 
rural families that cannot afford to pay thousands of rubles to 
an outside family encourage their children to marry within the 
newspaper said 
the article quoted local marriage office workers as saying they 
are powerless to prevent intermarriage and called for changes in 
the republics legal code to deter close relatives from marrying 
it noted however that traditions in rural regions are not so 
easily broken and that many of the related couples who arrive at 
public offices to register their weddings do so only after they 
in fact have already become husband and wife 
turkmenia like most of central asia is populated mostly by 
moslems who marry in religious ceremonies and register with soviet 
authorities as a formality 
the article titled marrying a brother also called on 
teachers and health care workers to inform rural residents of the 
genetic dangers involved in bearing children with a close relative

prime minister yitzhak shamir called on soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze to come to israel for talks 
when he visits the middle east later this month 
i think it would be helpful for us and i think it could be 
helpful also for the soviets shamir said in a joint interview 
with the associated press and the german news agency dpa 
the israeli leaders statements represented a marked change from 
hardline statements earlier this year that warned of the dangers 
of soviet involvement in middle east peace efforts 
shamir said shevardnadze and secretary of state george p shultz 
had signaled their intentions to visit the middle east in the 
coming weeks although details had not been finalized 
we know about some intentions of both of them to do something 
about the unrest in the israelioccupied territories about peace 
in our area but we dont know details of their next steps said 
shamir 
he said he would respond favorably to a visit of a highranking 
soviet official such as shevardnadze adding we would welcome 
it and we will be willing to talk with him 
speaking sunday in his office at the prime ministry shamir 
stressed that israel was the key to efforts aimed at rekindling a 
peace process in the middle east 
asked if the soviets and americans could work together on a 
peace shuttle shamir said i think first of all they have to 
work with us we are the most important partner in such an effort 
shamir also said he wanted to discuss with shevardadnze the 
normalizing of relations which were broken by moscow after the 
1967 middle east war as well as the emigration of soviet jews 
for us its important to have an opportunity to present our 
positions our views about the necessity for the soviet union to 
establish normal relations with israel and also to try to convince 
the soviet union to change its policy regarding jewish 
emigration shamir said 
as a precondition for soviet involvement in middle east 
peacemaking israel has demanded restoration of relations and free 
immigration for the 380000 jews who israel claims want to leave 
the soviet union 
on thursday israels independence day shamir and president 
reagan are to sign a new memorandum of understanding that calls for 
strategic cooperation in political and military spheres 
shamir said the pact would affirm existing agreements and 
stressed it was not an antisoviet agreement adding there is 
not any new element in this memo but it institutionalizes all the 
existing agreements 
the 73yearold israeli premier defended israels use of force 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip saying it had reduced the 
scope of the rioting in recent weeks 
i think there is a certain improvement and i hope it will go 
on because i imagine that many palestinian arabs understand that 
this way of violence will not help any cause he said 
shamir said he was not ready to comment on statements by 
israeli sources that israeli forces assassinated khalil alwazir 
the plos head of military operations who was killed in tunis on 
saturday 
the influence of the plo and the refusal of moderate 
palestinians to speak with israel were cited by shamir as reasons 
for a lack of a solution 
one of the important reasons for the palestinian tragedy since 
the beginning of the century is their being exposed to influences 
from outside said shamir 
he said it was his belief that the 15 million palestinians in 
the west bank and gaza strip were not yet ripe to handle their 
own affairs and deal directly with israel 
theyve always relied more on arab factors from outside and 
when there was a local leadership it was always an extreme 
violent minority and this situation still exists he said 
shamir said he believed the future of the occupied territories 
which were captured from jordan and egypt in 1967 would be one 
of the main subjects in israels november general elections 
he indicated elections may again result in a national unity 
government a coalition like the one that has shared power since 
the 1984 balloting ended in stalemate 
even though shamirs rightwing likud bloc and foreign minister 
shimon peres centerleft labor party have fought frequently 
shamir said a large part of the populace favored such a coalition 
i hope that if such a situation will arise we will find ways 
to make it better than this time he said

a selfeducated janitor who wore his 
lawyers handmedowns and lived frugally while investing in the 
stock market has left at least 600000 to the college where he 
mopped floors for 30 years 
lawrence r hummel who died march 22 at age 82 had amassed 1 
million with investment knowledge gleaned in part from discussions 
with professors and from economics classes he audited at bethany 
college 
if you saw him and talked with him noticed his demeanor and 
the way he dressed you might confuse him with the only word thing 
i can think of is a bum said his lawyer joseph gompers of 
wheeling 
but he wasnt he was a warm compassionate person who cared 
about people i would give him some of my old clothes to wear if i 
didnt i know he would never buy any for himself 
hummel lived frugally investing money from the sale of his 
share of the family dairy farm in 1953 to his late brother george 
along with wages from the private 800student college in northern 
west virginia he worked at bethany from 1953 to 1983 
he knew the stock market inside and out he was always at the 
college library reading the wall street journal to follow the stock 
market said gompers 
the college will receive an initial 600000 from the estate 
gompers said a trust fund for a disabled nephew will get 400000 
the balance of which will revert to the college on the nephews 
death a niece and two other nephews each received 2000 
i never imagined he had that kind of money said forrest h 
kirkpatrick dean of the faculty 
i taught economics and business at bethany for many years and 
larry hummel would be sitting and waiting for my car to arrive and 
he wanted to talk about stocks kirkpatrick said he asked me 
general questions and i had no idea how much he was investing i 
have no idea what his stock portfolio is either 
hummel sat in on every lecture that perry gresham former 
bethany president gave on economics he often asked gresham about 
investments and asked what things at the college were worthy of 
support 
what gresham best remembers about hummel is how hard he worked 
it was past time to quit many times when i saw him gresham

the house voted 3937 on tuesday to place its 
symbolic stamp of approval on the new treaty banning mediumrange 
nuclear weapons worldwide 
the action has no practical effect since the senate has 
exclusive rights to consent to the ratification of treaties 
but it does put the house on record as overwhelmingly endorsing 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty shortly before the 
senate opens debate on the agreement 
the resolution voicing support of the treaty which was 
concluded by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in washington last december also made a series of 
nonbinding policy statements in which the house 
declared that the president should continue to provide a 
credible nuclear deterrent force including maintaining nuclear 
weapons in europe to help ensure the security of the nato alliance 
called on the president to provide leadership to strengthen 
natos conventional forces and modernize the alliances nuclear 
deterrent forces in europe 
urged the administration to seek verifiable conventional arms 
agreements resulting in warsaw pact arms reductions in those areas 
where pact forces have superior strength 
called for the creation of a comprehensive arms control 
strategy 
endorsed the reagan administrations effort to negotiate with 
the soviet union effectively verifiable reductions in strategic 
intercontinental nuclear forces 
declared the president should act appropriately to deal with 
any soviet violations of the new inf treaty including withdrawing 
from it if the violations are serious 
called on the president to propose ways of resolving existing 
alleged soviet arms control violations and to address any future 
soviet arms control violations in a decisive manner 
the inf treaty requires the destruction of all us and soviet 
missiles with a range of between 300 miles and 3400 miles it bans 
flight tests of any missiles within that range and it provides for 
onsite inspection to verify compliance most such weapons are 
deployed in europe but the treaty imposes a worldwide ban 
the house resolution stated that the treaty sets an important 
precedent by requiring the soviets to destroy more weapons than the 
united states in order to eliminate all such mediumrange missiles 
it applauded verification requirements as being extremely 
stringent 
the inf treaty vindicates the importance of nato security 
cooperation and illustrates the ability of the members in nato to 
act in concert to accomplish meaningful reductions in soviet 
nuclear arms the resolution declared 
rep dan burton rind one of the few house members to speak 
against the treaty said it should be rejected because the soviets 
can cover european targets with longrange weapons and because he 
contended moscow is certain to cheat 
the soviet union sucks us into agreements and later violates 
them burton asserted this is another tragic mistake

a french warship spotted three mines and 
iranian spe navy vessels 
a marine executive said the gulf appeared ghostly from lack 
of shipping he and others said commercial vessels were avoiding 
the waterway where iran and iraq have been at war since september 
1980 and the us navy sank or damaged six iranian vessels monday 
they also said the united states had suspended escorts of 
kuwaiti oil tankers temporarily but defense department spokesman 
dan howard denied it the united states gave american flags and 
registration to 11 kuwaiti tankers last year and the navy escorts 
them through the gulf 
president reagan said things were quieter in the gulf tuesday 
and we hope it continues that way 
iran claimed its speedboats in the southern gulf sank an 
american naval logistical ship killing its crew an hour after 
navy ships destroyed two iranian oil platforms monday 
the official islamic republic news agency headlined the dispatch 
yankees go down to watery grave as revolutionary guards sink us 
ship but it contained no details 
at the defense department in washington howard said of the 
claim no report has reached us from our forces in the gulf of 
any hostile acts against them today 
after the confrontation monday the pentagon said there were no 
confirmed us casualties but a search was being conducted for an 
missing ah1 helicopter with two crewmen aboard iran claimed to 
have shot it down 
at the united nations in new york iran lodged a formal 
complaint tuesday about attacks by the warmonger united 
states washington responded that its actions had been necessary 
and proportionate 
irna also said an american attack monday on the patrol boat 
joshan killed 15 crew members and injured 29 
in mondays operations us navy forces destroyed two offshore 
iranian oil platforms in the southern gulf then sank the joshan 
disabled two frigates and sank or damaged three attack boats 
iran attacked neutral commercial ships after the raid on the 
platform which were in retaliation for a mine that damaged the 
frigate uss samuel b roberts last week and wounded 10 crewmen 
tehran radio said tuesday the swiss ambassador who represents 
american interests in iran was summoned to the foreign ministry 
and given a written warning in regard to americas aggressive 
attacks it said the note emphasized that iran will retaliate 
shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the french warship spotted three mines in an area of the central 
gulf previously believed minefree no details were available 
after midmorning distress signals from two tankers entering the 
narrow strait of hormuz the southern gateway to the gulf owners 
and agents advised their vessels to anchor just outside the gulf 
off khor fakkan the executives said 
they identified the two ships attacked as the meltem flying the 
bahamas flag and the 12215ton fal5 from the united arab 
emirates no details about the meltem were available but they said 
the fal5 was set ablaze and omani coastguard boats rescued the 
crew 
associated press reporter richard pyle in a report from 
shipboard said a five iranian missiles were fired from shore 
monday at a threeship surface action group they were the 
first such attacks reported on us warships 
the three navy ships took evasive action and fired chaff into 
the air which confused the missiles guidance systems and caused 
them to miss 
one missile crossed behind the ships and hit a distant oil 
platform which was not identified 
navy officers identified the missiles as chinesemade silkworms 
which are known to be based in and near the strait the pentagon 
said however that it had not confirmed the missile type 
although the pentagon denied it sources close to the kuwait oil 
tanker co said the navy was halting excorts of the 11 reflagged 
tankers until further notice no convoys had been reported under 
way this week and the kuwaitis said they were suspended after the 
samuel b roberts hit the mine last week 
according to the sources the mine was in a main channel off the 
qatar peninsula that leads to the northern gulf and a mine sweeping 
operation must be completed before convoys resume 
pentagon officials said the ah1 cobra helicopter did not return 
to the uss wainwright on monday after a routine reconnaissance 
mission 
howard the defense spokesman said the search continued tuesday 
but the marine corps had formally changed the status of the two 
crewmen to missing 
he identified them as capt stephan c leslie and capt kenneth 
w hill assigned to squadron hmla167 based at the new river

prayers and songs filled the air tuesday 
as thousands remembered the jewish men and women who fought nazi 
germany and died in the warsaw ghetto 45 years ago 
late in the day antiisraeli arab students marched to the main 
monument of the warsaw ghetto uprising and a plo delegation laid a 
wreath 
the ceremony in which prayers songs and flowers were offered in 
memory of the dead took place at midday on the broad plaza in front 
of the ghetto fighters monument 
at 430 pm about 25 arab and african students arrived at the 
same site carrying banners criticizing israeli conduct in the 
occupied territories of the west bank and gaza strip they were 
joined by a delegation from the palestine liberation organization 
diplomatic mission to poland 
as police looked on the plo group laid a wreath of white 
lillies two yards from the wreath presented by the state of israel 
the wreath draped with a colorful arab scarf said from the 
fallen in the palestinian uprising to the heroes of the warsaw 
ghetto uprising 
exactly 45 years ago tuesday heavily armed squadrons of nazi 
troops entered the walled jewish quarter of warsaw bent on the 
quick annihilation of the last 70000 inhabitants instead they 
were routed by the starving poorly armed residents who started a 
doomed threeweek struggle 
before the main cerresenting 
veterans groups jewish communities worldwide and polish 
organizations laid wreath after wreath of flowers at the foot of 
the monument a bold relief of armed fighters crouched together 
facing their foes 
the monument near the citys heart was the very first erected 
in the destroyed left bank of warsaw after the war 
as a crowd of about 4000 poles and israelis stood side by side 
under the leaden sky a cantor sang kaddish the jewish song of 
mourning and rabbi isser frankel of tel aviv prayed for the 
victims of the ghetto and the nazi holocaust in poland 
later when the polish officials and military honor guard 
withdrew israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their 
national anthem hatikvah the hope 
poland and israel do not have fullfledged diplomatic relations 
deputy prime minister itzhak navon in poland on a visit 
considered private addressed the crowd and expressed thanks to 
polish authorities for the ceremony 
he also spoke of the holocaust in which 6 million jews were put 
to death in world war ii 3 million of them polish jews 
we have to remember yes but not a paralyzing memory he 
said in english not only remember the past but we should derive 
a new determination from that tragedy to continue living 
an assembly at warsaws palace of culture and science took place 
later in the day with speeches marking the anniversary 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski was absent from the main 
ceremony but met tuesday with a delegation of the visiting jewish 
leaders 
about 3000 people from israel and around the world have come to 
poland for the observances beginning april 14 fewer than the 4500 
originally expected 
jewish visitors to poland objected five years ago when 
palestinian diplomats were allowed to lay flowers at the main 
ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the ghetto uprising 
this year polish officials did not invite diplomats to take 
part in the ceremony at the monument but representatives of 
several nations held private wreathlayings later in the day 
the last diplomatic group was led by deputy chief of the plo 
mission in warsaw shawki alomari 
julius spiegel of new york city watched the scene and said 
afterward he had no objections to the wreathlaying 
they have a right i have no sympathy for terrorism of 
course but i have some sympathy for the palestinian people i 
think it was quite dignified he said 
the polish staterun news agency pap meanwhile distributed a 
text of a letter from plo ambassador abdullah hijazi to polish 
officials likening nazi fascism in world war ii to israeli 
fascism in the occupied west bank 
the letter expressed deepest respect for the fallen of the 
warsaw ghetto

the body of khalil alwazir the plo 
military commander assassinated in tunis last week was met in 
syria on tuesday by grieving relatives and competing factions of 
the plo 
the plochartered plane carrying the body of alwazir his wife 
five children and plo officials touched down at damascus airport at 
245 pm 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat was not 
aboard the plane arafat saw the body off at tunis airport in 
tunisia but stayed behind apparently because of his feud with 
president hafez assad of syria 
alwazir 52 also known as abu jihad was killed saturday by 
armed commandos who burst into his home in suburban tunis the 
funeral was set for wednesday 
israeli sources have said israeli security forces carried out 
the attack but the israeli government has refused to confirm this 
the plo and tunisia have blamed israel for the assassination 
tunisia on tuesday requested a special session of the united 
nations security council to condemn the slaying 
alwazirs mother fawzieh hugged and kissed his wife intisar 
as she stepped from the plane alwazirs sick father could not 
make it to the airport 
among those aboard the plane were five members of the plo 
central committee all members of fatah the backbone of the plo 
also aboard were members of the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine and the moscoworiented democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine 
the popular front and the democratic front are the main factions 
making up the plo after fatah 
arafat and alwazir were expelled from damascus in june 1983 
after a syrianbacked mutiny in plo ranks 
alwazir was born in ramle which is now in israel and had 
asked to be buried close to palestine his mother and father live 
in damascus 
palestinian delegations at the airport rushed to embrace the plo 
officials as they stepped from the plane george habash who leads 
the popular front took mrs alwazir in his arms 
mrs alwazir wearing a black dress and a palestinian flag 
scarf emerged from the plane carrying a poster of her husband in 
one hand and flashing v for victory in the other 
in soul in blood we shall continue the march to palestine 
vowed mrs alwazir flanked by her children all wearing olive 
green military fatigues 
about 30 palestinian girl and boy scouts some clad in plo flags 
and others in traditional palestinian costumes repeated mrs 
wazirs words adding there is no god but god god loved abu 
jihad 
the boy scouts standing near the plane and carrying four 
wreaths including one from arafat sang palestinian revolutionary 
songs alwazirs 21yearold son bassil vowed to avenge the loss 
of his father 
my fathers martyrdom means a new beginning a new start 
readiness and will to fight for the freedom of palestine bassil 
told reporters in english 
representatives of assads government and the jordanian 
government of king hussein also were at the airport 
dozens of palestinian men carried alwazirs coffin draped in a 
red white green and black palestinian flag out of the plane into 
a waiting ambulance an hour after its arrival 
a tunisian commission investigating the assassination has 
concluded that the operation was conducted by israel commandos 
the tunisian ambassador to washington said tuesday the most 
conclusive piece of evidence was the presence of a boeing 707 
aircraft with israeli markings off the tunisian coast at the time 
of the assassination 
the plane used sophisticated electronic equipment to jam 
telecommunications around the town where alwazir lived he said

michael jackson pranced danced and rocked at an 
age when most kids are still molding play doh an international 
star and millionaire by adolescence his life has remained 
shrouded his new autobiography moonwalk hopes to rip through 
that cloak 
it doesnt what we have here is a failure to titillate 
the 283page book to be released this week by doubleday does 
not name lovers explain the megastars affection for the elephant 
man detail massive plastic surgery and skin whitening talk about 
the oxygen pressure chamber he purportedly wanted to prolong his 
life or serve up any other delicious show biz dish 
rather moonwalk is a gentle excursion into the 24 years 
jackson has spent as a performer the title refers to the sliding 
dance step he popularized 
i was interested in being able to talk about how i feel in a 
book that would be mine my words and my voice the 29yearold 
star says i hope it will clear up some misconceptions 
misconceptions are as plentiful in jacksons life as screaming 
teenagers at his concerts the media it seems has not been kind 
to little michael 
i dont understand why they feel the need to make up things 
about me he writes i take some small pride in thinking that 
ive come out pretty well all things considered its a 
difficult life very few manage any semblance of a normal 
childhood 
he admits to having two nose jobs and a chin cleft however he 
said he has not had his cheeks or eyes altered or a skin peel 
he acknowledges longstanding friendships with tatum oneal 
brooke shields liza minnelli elizabeth taylor and diana ross 
but there is no kiss and tell 
the closest he gets is a passage about a date with oneal they 
went to a club in los angeles called on the rox and the young 
actress grabbed his hand 
this probably wouldnt mean a lot to other people but it was 
serious stuff to me she touched me he says in the book 
jackson was asked to do the book in 1984 by two doubleday 
editors jacqueline onassis who wrote the dedication page and 
shaye areheart who worked closely with the reclusive star and 
helped him write 
he was someone we admired and thought was a real musical 
genius and he had had a long and fascinating career considering 
his age areheart said in an interview i think the book 
reflects the michael jackson ive come to know hes very 
sensitive very loyal very kind 
hes every inch a professional hes that way in every aspect 
of his life hes very articulate very intelligent very creative 
very lovely 
areheart who has been a doubleday editor for nine years said 
both she and jackson were satisfied with the result 
i didnt put any pressure on him about subjects he wanted to 
discuss in the book she said i wanted him to write a book 
that reflected things he wanted to share with people i thought he 
was amazingly candid and warm and did an excellent job 
jacksons honesty is illuminated in his feelings about his 
loneliness his family how his career was managed and his missed 
childhood 
he started performing when he was 5 and recalled coming home 
from school dropping his books going to the studio returning 
home around midnight and sometimes never even having time for a 
snack there was a park across the street from the motown studio 
and he used to watch other youngsters at play 
id just stare at them in wonder i couldnt imagine such 
freedom such a carefree life and wish more than anything that i 
had that kind of freedom that i could walk away and be like them 
so there were sad moments in my childhood he said 
michael jackson is the seventh of nine children born to joseph 
and katherine jackson in gary ind he performed as lead singer 
with his older brothers as the jackson 5 they released 26 albums 
for motown and epic 
their father a steel mill worker who played with a local rhythm 
and blues band was extremely strict with the young performers 
wed perform for him and hed critique us jackson writes 
if you messed up you got hit sometimes with a belt sometimes 
with a switch dad would make me so mad and hurt that id try 
to get back at him and get beaten all the more 
when he turned 21 his fathers management contract expired and 
michael dissatisfied with how his career was going especially 
with motowns refusal to allow the jacksons to write and produce 
fired him

attorney general edwin meese iii said tuesday 
he didnt know until last week that the real estate family 
contributing money for his wifes salary was leasing office space 
to the justice department 
in his first comments to reporters on the subject meese said 
theres absolutely no connection between his wifes 
40000ayear salary donated to a charity by the bender family 
foundation and a subsequent 50 million justice department lease 
with a partnership headed by howard m bender 
meese also said that as attorney general he never participated 
in any matter pertaining to the benders 
after meeting with several republican congressmen on capitol 
hill to discuss his trip earlier this month to south america meese 
was asked whether it would have been better not to accept money 
that was coming from a family that was renting offices to the 
justice department 
i think at the time nobody knew that they the benders were 
renting buildings to the justice department he replied as a 
matter of fact i didnt know that until i saw it in the news media 
last week 
the associated press reported last wednesday that a partnership 
headed by bender won a 50 million lease renewal on a justice 
department building housing offices of the immigration and 
naturalization service a justice department agency 
thirteen days after obtaining the new lease real estate 
developer bender and his partners sold the building for 226 
million more than they had paid for it two years earlier earning a 
60 percent profit 
let me just say theres absolutely no connection between the 
two things his wifes salary and the benders business with the 
justice department and i think that will be made plain ultimately 
when all the facts are out meese said 
the attorney general was referring to the criminal investigation 
of his activities being conducted by independent counsel james 
mckay 
mckay is looking into the involvement of longtime meese friend 
e robert wallach in ursula meese taking her position with the 
multiple sclerosis society to which the bender foundation 
contributed the money constituting her salary 
wallachs attorney george walker has told the washington post 
that wallach played a peripheral role in mrs meese taking the 
job at the ms society 
wallachs ties to meese and wallachs and meeses involvement 
with scandalplagued wedtech corp triggered mckays probe of the 
attorney general last may 11 
since then the investigation has spread to mrs meeses job and 
meeses actions on behalf of a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline 
project in which wallach was acting as a lawyer for one of the 
partners 
in addition mckay has been delving into meeses ownership of 
14000 in regional bell telephone company stock during a time when 
as attorney general he was meeting with executives of the baby 
bell companies

about 1000 cubans in federal custody have been 
determined a risk to the community by the immigration and 
naturalization service bringing them one step closer to 
deportation officials said 
the ins will begin informing the prisoners this week that they 
are considered nonreleasable duke austin an ins spokesman in 
washington said monday 
the agencys action follows an agreement last year between the 
government and rioting cuban prisoners in atlanta which called for 
a review of the cases of 3800 cubans in detention at the time 
but in miami a lawyer who was present at the signing of the 
agreement complained that prisoners were not allowed to present 
evidence or witnesses during the ins review 
its a paper review its a joke said rafael penalver the 
prisoners also will not get hearings during the appeal process he 
added 
the prisoners who came to the united states in the 1980 
boatlift from the cuban port of mariel had committed crimes in 
this country and served out their prison terms before the ins 
detained them indefinitely 
in addition to the 1000 judged nonreleasable about 2100 of 
the detainees have been released or approved for release ins 
officials said the rest still are being reviewed 
once they get their notices the prisoners have 30 days to 
appeal to the ins if that fails they can appeal to a special 
justice department panel 
anyone failing both appeals can remain in detention 
indefinitely but many of the nonreleasable detainees also will 
receive deportation notices said justice department spokesman 
patrick korten the deportation process includes two further 
chances at appeal 
i think this is due process and then some korten said 
korten would not say when deportation notices would be sent or 
how long the appeals could take 
the prisoners rioted last fall days after the state department 
announced on nov 20 that an immigration pact with cuba had been 
renewed 
under the accord up to 20000 cubans could come to the united 
states each year as immigrants and up to 3000 more could arrive as 
refugees cuba in turn agreed to take back at least 2545 mariel 
felons in ins custody 
the news sparked riots at prisons in atlanta and in oakdale la 
many of the detainees had spent years in ins detention and expected 
to be released under an ins review that started last june

the head of the securities industrys largest 
trade group told congress on tuesday that despite progress in some 
areas he remains very concerned by lack of cooperation between 
stock and futures exchanges 
my deep concern is that things are moving so slowly in coming 
up with the coordination between the various major markets said 
john w bachmann chairman of the securities industry association 
new york stock exchange chairman john j phelan and chicago 
mercantile exchange chairman leo melamed told congress last week 
that they likely were within 30 days of reaching an agreement on 
coordinating market halts when stocks or stock futures rise or fall 
too sharply 
but bachmann who is chief executive officer of edward d jones 
amp co a st louis brokerage firm told the senate banking 
committee that the pace of reform by the exchanges has been 
painfully slow 
exchanges while theyre quasipublic institutions are still 
very much like businesses and competitive advantage is very 
important he said thus they are torn between loyalties 
when considering measures to prevent another stock market crash 
bachmann said he finds market halts very distasteful but 
the lesser of two evils when compared with the destruction of 
our markets john m damgard president of the futures industry 
association the trade group for futures brokers said he favors 
natural trading halts such as price limits 
however stocks and futures industries remain split over the 
level of margins the amount of money needed to control an 
investment the securities and exchange commission is pushing for 
higher futures margins while the futures exchanges say their 
margins raised after the crash are now high enough 
bachmann advocated the creation of a new panel of senior 
exchange officials which under the oversight of the sec would 
attempt to resolve such policy disagreements 
bachmann opposed a proposal by senate banking committee chairman 
william proxmire dwis that would create a supercommittee of 
federal regulatory agencies to decide policy conflicts by majority 
vote 
instead he backed the secs bid for authority over stock 
futures which currently rests with the commodity futures trading 
commission authority over futures margins should go to the federal 
reserve board which already sets stock margins bachmann said 
damgard also opposed proxmires proposal which was introduced 
last month with the support of nicholas brady a wall street 
investment banker and former senator who headed a presidential task 
force that studied the crash 
damgard said it would be inappropriate for independent 
regulatory agencies to be forced to bend to the wishes of other 
regulatory agencies 
he recommended that congress refrain from tinkering with the 
current division of regulatory turf but said more cooperation could 
be fostered by continuing a white house working group which is 
planning to report its recommendations next month 
damgard said such a group would allow agencies to bring subtle 
pressures on one another without making one party knuckle under 
he also said futures margins are best set by the individual 
exchanges 
however proxmire told damgard it seems to me what youre 
calling for is if not chaotic at least indecisive

years tuesday as john o norquist took over from the retiring henry 
maier and pledged to shake things up a little 
norquist who was elected april 5 by a comfortable margin took 
the oath of office and replaced the longest serving bigcity mayor 
in the country 
after 28 years of leadership from mayor henry maier milwaukee 
is prepared to build on his accomplishments and to improve upon 
them where we can norquist said in his inaugural address at city 
hall before about 200 city and state officials and supporters 
maier 70 a past president of the us conference of mayors and 
national league of cities announced last year he would not seek 
reelection because of his age 
after norquist was sworn in maier wished his successor good 
luck i know you have the courage and vision to do the job 
maier said 
norquist 38 whose campaign themes stressed the need for 
change said he planned to seek broader cabinetgovernment powers 
one proposal would allow the mayor to hire and fire certain city 
officials who now have set terms of office 
norquist also immediately replaced five maier appointees on the 
metropolitan sewerage commission and called for the panel to fight 
water pollution 
but one of norquists biggest challenges will be grappling with 
lingering racial divisions in the inner city where blacks suffer 
from high rates of unemployment and welfare 
milwaukee has always been proud of its racial and ethnic 
diversity he said but not all racial and ethnic minorities 
have shared equally in our progress 
city government can be and must be a leader in breaking down 
the barriers of discrimination and bringing this city together 
norquist pledged to open city government to minorities and of 
his 12 staff appointments three are black and one is hispanic 
norquist also said creating jobs would be a top priority 
all of the economic development tools and resources at our 
disposal will be targeted toward creating jobs and keeping them 
here in milwaukee he said 
norquist said he planned to alter the structure of city 
government to cut expenses and hold down property taxes 
i said many times during this campaign that milwaukee is at a 
crossroads he said which path we take will determine whether 
milwaukee takes its place as one of americas truly great cities in 
the 1990s or whether it settles for secondclass status

mondays naval battle in the persian gulf 
marked the most heated conflict in the us effort aimed ostensibly 
at calming the tanker war between iran and iraq 
the us intervention nearly a year ago came when many 
administration analysts believed iraq was in danger of losing the 
war it began with iran in september 1980 a fear that has faded 
the naval engagements on monday coincided with claims by iraq 
that it had retaken the faw peninsula which it lost in 1986 in 
what many observers considered to be irans major victory in the 
iraniraq war 
iran on tuesday denied it had lost faw but noisily claimed that 
us helicopters had flown air support for iraqi troops allowing 
it to blame the great satan for what could prove to be a major 
iranian defeat in the ground war 
pentagon spokesman dan howard denied that us forces flew in 
support of iraqi troops he and other administration officials 
portrayed the naval engagements on monday as a kick in the teeth 
that they hoped would keep iranian ships speedboats and mines out 
of the gulf 
in the wake of the fighting monday the twoman crew of a us 
helicopter was missing and an unknown number of iranians were dead 
that was thought to be the most casualties in the tanker war since 
an iraqi warplane mistakenly fired on the uss stark killing 37 
american sailors on may 17 1987 
many members of congress expressed support for the latest us 
actions but the fighting renewed talk on capitol hill of invoking 
the war powers resolution under which congress would have 60 days 
or at most 90 days to approve the deployment of us forces in a 
war zone 
the reagan administration fended off congressional efforts to 
invoke the war powers resolution last year but in doing so sent 
mixed signals about why it had agreed in the winter of 198687 to 
reflag 11 kuwaiti oil tankers and provide them naval escorts in and 
out of the gulf 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee sen sam 
nunn dga led criticism of the us policy last spring saying 
we have basically taken a strong tilt toward iraq that ought to 
be debated on its own merit and not under the illusions that we are 
protecting the free flow of oil 
administration officials said the goal of the escorts was to 
protect the flow of oil out of the gulf but also acknowledged they 
wanted to restore us credibility among the arabs following 
disclosures that washington had sold arms to iran 
an iranian victory in the war they said would endanger arab 
states along the gulf a fear that was reinforced by riots by 
iranians pilgrims to mecca on july 31 
and administration officials said they met the kuwaiti request 
for protection in order to prevent the soviet union from providing 
the escorts and thereby increasing kremlin influence in the region 
the us effort soon became a contest of wills between the 
reagan administration and the regime of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini and the iranians appeared at times to have the upper hand 
the escorts actually began last july 22 as four us warships 
sailed with two usflagged kuwaiti tankers the gas prince and 
the bridgeton 
as the convoy neared an oil loading terminal in kuwait a mine 
explosion rocked the bridgeton a 400000ton supertanker 
the us warships crept the remainder of the way in the wake of 
the bridgeton which one american navy officer likened to a deep 
draft mine sweeper 
iran called the debacle an irreparable blow to american 
military and political prestige and said the mine had been laid 
by invisible hands 
although iran for the most part avoided attacking us vessels 
directly its mines and speedboats continued to plague gulf 
shipping then on oct 15 an iranian silkworm missile fired from 
faw struck a usowned vessel the sungari and the next day 
another silkworm hit a reflagged kuwaiti tanker the sea isle city 
blinding its american captain john hunt 
on oct 19 the united states struck back four us warships 
fired 1065 rounds from fiveinch guns at an iranian oil rig 
destroying it 
iran then still winning the ground war refrained from a direct 
response 
but over the winter iran failed to launch its annual kerbala 
offensive along the southern front and there were reports that the 
khomeini regime was having trouble finding martyrs to fill the 
ranks 
then iraq launched its surprise offensive to retake faw 
confronted with defeat on land iran responded with force to the 
new american attack on oil platforms in the gulf an attack very 
similar to the one iran ignored last october 
us vigilance had tightened since the attack on the stark 11 
months beforehand and the apparent american military success 
seemed likely to fend off any moved in congress recall the 25 to 30 
us naval vessels in and around the gulf

houses most of the labor is volunteer 
the houses are woodframe structures designed to be simple but 
adequate with all of the basics and few frills 
habitat has built 24 homes in atlanta since it started in the 
city in 1983 and hopes to complete 75 by 1990 city figures show 31 
percent of atlantas housing to be substandard compared with a 
nationwide average of 8 percent 
habitat is doing what the federal state and local governments 
should be doing said mayor andrew young who also is active in 
the habitat organization habitat is showing us the way 
so far 10 families have been picked for the 20 homes to be built 
in the 600000 project

thirty protesters from the minnesota 
chippewa tribe occupied the lobby of tribal headquarters for a 
second day tuesday to protest a hunting and fishing rights 
agreement between the tribe and the state 
protesters said they would stay until elected tribal officials 
meet with them they brought food blankets and a television set 
into the building which also houses the local office of the us 
bureau of indian affairs the protesters were not barring entry to 
the bia offices 
tribal officials have told the protesters they would have to 
wait until a regular tribal committee meeting april 28 in grand 
portage to talk with tribal leaders 
on monday tribal officials threatened to call police if the 
protesters remained in the headquarters building after the 5 pm 
closing time but cass county sheriff jim dowson said monday night 
they havent called and im not going to do anything about it 
unless theyre harming people 
no problems have been reported 
the protesters have said their leaders reached agreement with 
the state on hunting and fishing rights in northeastern minnesota 
without consulting the members they also said the agreement 
approved by legislature and signed by gov rudy perpich last week 
gives away their hunting and fishing rights for a fraction of their 
worth 
the agreement the protesters argue violates federal law by 
interfering with the treaty of 1854 between the united states and 
the anishinabe nation whose anglicized name is chippewa 
the agreement requires the fond du lac boise fort and grand 
portage chippewa bands to abstain from exercising full hunting 
fishing and gathering rights reserved under the 1854 treaty 
in exchange the three bands would received 5 million annually 
the agreement does not affect hunting and fishing on 
reservations but requires indians to give up their rights under 
the treaty to hunt and fish free of state restrictions on 
nonreservation land 
the area involved covers about 10000 square miles among the 
three tribes and reaches roughly from the snake river north to the 
canadian border near the mouth of the vermillion river and east to 
lake superior

the defense department needs to improve its 
compliance with a law designed to eliminate conflict of interest 
questions about pentagon advisers the general accounting office 
said tuesday 
the pentagon is generally complying with the federal 
advisory committee act but some key steps still have not been 
implemented and should be said rosslyn kleeman of the 
congressional watchdog agency 
the testimony before the senate governmental affairs committee 
centered on expert panels created to advise the strategic defense 
initiative organization the office created in 1983 to oversee 
president reagans star wars antimissile program 
the sdio was chosen for a review because it uses a large number 
of expert committees throughout the government there are more 
than 1000 advisory committees on a wide range of topics 
five years ago the pentagon was sharply criticized for lax 
management of conflictofinterest and ethical questions and the 
sdio advisory committees were created after that review 
although the defense department is doing a better job its 
still not good enough the gao said 
specifically the advisory committees need to document the 
reasons why individuals were selected for advisory committees and 
panels in order to demonstrate how they went about achieving the 
balanced membership required in the act kleeman said 
in addition the gao study said the committees need better 
documentation of financial disclosure statements made by panel 
members and need a better review process to make sure ethical 
questions are answered 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the panel said the 
pentagon has taken steps to improve its oversight of the committees 
but he added that the pentagons compliance remains open 
to question with a requirement for documenting why people are 
picked 
david o cooke deputy assistant secretary of defense for 
administration testified that the pentagon has tried to improve 
its oversight of the panels 
problems regarding the administration of dod advisory 
committees sometimes surface he said when they do we address 
them promptly 
william carroll general counsel for the sdio admitted that his 
office had found a weakness in our internal management controls 
which delayed appointments of consultants 
david parnas a computer scientist at queens university in 
ontario canada testified that three years ago he was offered 
1000 per day to serve on a panel advising the sdio on computer 
software he said he was appointed despite the fact he told 
pentagon officials he already was a parttime employee of the naval 
research laboratory

a death camp survivor said tuesday that the 
conviction of john demjanjuk for nazi war crimes avenged millions 
of jews killed in the holocaust but demjanjuks family contended 
he was the victim of biased judges 
this verdict is revenge for all those who did not survive a 
jubilant pinchas epstein told israel radio 
epstein had testified during the 14month trial that he 
recognized the retired us autoworker as ivan the terrible 
the nickname used by prisoners at treblinka death camp for one of 
their guards 
demjanjuks son john condemned the verdict as ludicrously 
sweeping and said it resulted from judges who lost their 
impartiality 
five 10 15 years from now when people look back at this 
trial john demjanjuk is going to be remembered as the victim 
his son said 
israeli officials applauded the conviction tuesday and justice 
minister avraham sharir called for the death penalty demjanjuk is 
to be sentenced next monday 
demjanjuk of suburban cleveland was convicted of operating gas 
chambers that killed 850000 jews at treblinka in nazioccupied 
poland in 1942 and 1943 in a 450page decision the judges 
rejected all defense arguments 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk 68 has maintained he is a victim 
of mistaken identity who was a nazi prisoner of war and was not at 
treblinka 
epstein one of five survivors who identified demjanjuk as 
ivan the terrible left the courtroom in tears monday when 
judges described atrocities committed by the nazi guard 
israels prime minister yitzhak shamir praised the trial and 
conviction every jew feels a certain degree of satisfaction from 
the conviction of demjanjuk the polishborn shamir told israel 
radio on tuesday his parents were killed in the holocaust 
speaking from paris justice minister sharir called for 
demjanjuk to be sentenced to death a man convicted of such 
terrible crimes deserves no other sentence he told israel radio 
however he has no authority over the state prosecutor who will 
argue the sentence at mondays hearing 
in a rare public comment former prime minister menachem begin 
who also lost family in the holocaust lauded the legal proceedings 
it was a just trial begin who has lived in seclusion for 
the past five years told israel radio thanks to the trial the 
younger israeli generation learned about the fate of the jews in 
the holocaust 
about 6 million jews were put to death in the holocaust 
zvi terlow who helped prosecute adolf eichmann the only other 
man tried in israel for nazi war crimes said he was certain the 
judges would not have convicted demjanjuk if there were doubts 
about his identity 
no stone was left unturned there was a mountain of 
evidence terlow said 
eichmann the architect of the holocaust was convicted and 
hanged in 1962 
demjanjuks soninlaw ed nishnic said the judges 
automatically rejected defense arguments 
it was as though the judges were sitting there with their ears 
covered and their eyes closed during the defense side of the 
case he said 
john demjanjuk jr said judging by the way they conducted the 
trial and totally disregarded our evidence in their verdict we 
dont expect anything less than the death penalty 
demjanjuks attorney john gill of cleveland said although he 
had expected a guilty verdict at the emotionally charged trial 
it totally surprised me that they the judges could be so 
devastatingly sweeping 
gill said he would argue against the death penalty on monday and 
planned to appeal to the supreme court 
there is no minimum sentence but demjanjuk is considered 
unlikely to receive anything short of life imprisonment

financial prospects for american farmers 
continue to brighten and one reason is a pickup in grain exports 
this year an agriculture department report said tuesday 
large purchases by the soviet union particularly wheat sold at 
subsidized prices have played an important role 
overall the soviet unions total grain imports are at a 
threeyear high despite bumper harvests the last two seasons the 
report said 
the gain is primarily from larger wheat purchases the 
departments economic research service said aided by the export 
enhancement program and soviet demand for millingquality wheat 
the us share of import volume is likely to rise to about half 
this year up from less than 1 percent in 198586 
the soviet union is expected to import 32 million metric tons of 
grain from all foreign sources in the international marketing year 
that runs through june 30 1988 that would be the most since 
imports were a record 555 million tons in 198485 
the wheat share of this years imports is estimated at 22 
million tons the most since 198485 when wheat rose to 281 
million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
soviet wheat imports dropped sharply in 198586 to 157 million 
tons when the us share declined to a trickle 
under a fiveyear agreement the soviet union is committed to 
buy at least 4 million tons of wheat and 4 million tons of corn 
annually the pact expires sept 30 and covers the year that began 
last oct 1 
although the agreement year is three months out of step with the 
july 1june 30 marketing year it does show a similar trend in 
soviet grain imports 
for example soviet wheat purchases fell short of the pacts 
minimum in 198485 when they dropped to 29 million tons and in 
198586 when they were only 200000 tons that coincided with the 
less than 1 percent us share cited in the latest report 
the export enhancement progam allows exporters to sell 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices and 
then collect free usdaowned commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
subsidized wheat sales to the soviet union began a year ago so 
far moscow has bought more than 88 million tons for delivery in 
198788 the final year of the grain pact 
in addition the soviets have bought 41 million tons of us 
corn 818400 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal 
for delivery through sept 30

the reagan admnistration supporting sweeping 
legal immunity for the government urged the supreme court on 
tuesday to kill a lawsuit in behalf of a boy who contracted polio 
after receiving a dose of federally approved vaccine 
some justices reacted skeptically to arguments by justice 
department lawyer michael k kellogg who said the government 
should be shielded from paying damages 
if you win you might as well repeal the federal tort claims 
act justice byron r white told kellogg 
the act permits the government to be sued in limited instances 
when officials negligently cause personal injuries the law does 
not surrender government immunity for injuries resulting from an 
officials discretionary function or duty 
kellogg urged the court to protect the government from suit 
even if a specific federal employee is negligent and is not 
exercising discretion 
the court is expected to announce by july whether it will revive 
a suit in behalf of polio victim kevan berkovitz who was less than 
three months old on may 10 1979 when his pediatrician in 
charleroi pa gave him a dose of orimune 
the drug manufactured by lederle laboratories is a form of 
sabin oral vaccine orimune was licensed by the government in 1963 
kevan was stricken with polio within a month and the us 
communicable disease center determined he contracted the disease 
from the vaccine he is paralyzed and deformed and breathes with 
the help of a respirator 
ms ellen m viakley a lawyer representing the berkovitz 
family urged the court tuesday to revive the suit to allow the 
family to prove that it may have been pure sheer negligence by 
government workers that caused the childs polio 
she alleged that in licensing the vaccine federal workers 
approved it even though the number and size of lesions it caused 
exceeded the governments standards it was not a discretionary 
decision by the government that the defective vaccine was safe she 
said 
the allegation is that the numbers of lesions didnt add 
up justice sandra day oconnor later said to kellogg the 
government lawyer 
he did not dispute that interpretation but kellogg said even 
when an employee is negligent the government agency he works for 
may be using its discretion in approving the vaccine 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals threw out the berkovitzs 
suit last year 
the appeals court said the food and drug administration is 
exempt from the suit because the fda exercised policymaking 
authority in effect its own discretion when it initially 
decided to verify test results by vaccine manufacturers 
the fdas decision on how to go about testing the safety of 
polio vaccine is a discretionary act that immunizes the government 
from suit the appeals court said 
the administration has argued that if the government can be sued 
in such cases it will be forced into becoming an insurer of 
vaccines and may withdraw from licensing them 
federal officials said sabin oral vaccine administered 
routinely to all children in the united states has all but 
eliminated polio even though each year a few who take the vaccine 
have adverse reactions 
the case is berkovitz vs us 87498

more than 150000 refugees fleeing a guerrilla 
war and drought in mozambique are likely to arrive in neighboring 
malawi over the next nine months adding enormous strains to an 
alreadytaxed relief effort the state department said tuesday 
malawi currently provides haven for 450000 mozambican refugees 
but the population in malawi is rapidly increasing and the most 
conservative estimates forecast 600000 refugees will arrive by 
december 1988 according to a state department report 
the report said other african countries also are receiving large 
numbers of refugees there are 75000 in zimbabwe 30000 in 
zambia 225000 in south africa 72000 in tanzania and 20000 in 
swaziland 
within mozambique there are 16 million displaced people the 
department said 
complicating the refugee situation is that malawi has also 
experienced a drought and a mealy bug infestation the department 
said more than one million malawians no longer have the 
resources to feed themselves 
a consultant hired by the state department to assess the 
magnitude of the problem and recommend us responses said he 
interviewed a selected geographically diverse sample of 200 
refugees in camps between january and march 
the consultant at a background briefing arranged by the bureau 
of refugee programs said 91 percent of those he interviewed 
reported they mozambique because of fighting between renamo a 
potent guerrilla movement and the maputo government the war has 
been going on since the mid1970s 
it reflects an intensity in the level of violence over the 
period of the last year the expert said i think the drought 
is an aggravating factor in increasing the refugee flows but 
according to the refugees with whom i spoke the great majority 
fled because of renamo related violence 
the state department has pledged 44 million to a un special 
appeal for mozambican refugees in malawi this is in addition to 
334 million contributed to the uns program covering all of 
africa

more than 2400 photographs from the 
assassination of robert kennedy were unaccountably destroyed nearly 
20 years ago officials said tuesday as they opened to the public 
for the first time the longsecret police files 
there was no explanation in the 50000 pages of documents why 
the pictures were burned or why such items as ceiling tiles and 
door jambs from the scene of kennedys death were destroyed in the 
months following the assassination 
california secretary of state march fong eu released the 
documents including interviews with 4000 witnesses and 2500 
photographs from the los angeles police department files 
the states chief archivist said the documents were unlikely to 
answer the numerous questions surrounding the 1968 assassination 
because of the destroyed material 
ive never seen a file quite this large said archivist john 
burns this is a very unusual murder file but im not 
absolutely satisfied that any questions are answered 
he said the biggest surprise was the amount of evidence 
destroyed including the photographs which were burned three 
months after the assassintation their subjects are unknown 
what i didnt know and im told others didnt know was that 
so much evidence was destroyed he said 
he also said he could not explain why evidence was destroyed 
noting police were careful at the outset because they didnt want 
another dallas where kennedys brother president john f 
kennedy was killed 
burns said he had not had time to examine all the evidence 
which he predicted will occupy researchers for years 
the gaps in the material drew immediate criticism 
someone should ask the police why they destroyed 2400 
photographs in the most important case theyve ever examined 
we didnt know about that until today said gregory stone a 
political scientist at the university of wisconsin and a longtime 
student of the case 
among the persistent questions raised by conspiracy theorists 
and scholars are was sirhan bishara sirhan the only gunman was 
kennedy shot from in front or behind were there eight shots or 
more in the pantry of the ambassador hotel and how close was the 
gunman whose bullet entered kennedys brain 
among the material put on display tuesday was a polka dot dress 
bullets taken from victims and sirhans diary entry saying rfk 
must die 
the dress was one of many purchased by police in an effort to 
jog the memories of witnesses on a point of contention that a 
girl in a polka dot dress seen running from the ambassador hotel 
shouting we shot him that report was never verified 
the documents released include an admission by police that they 
destroyed key evidence including ceiling tiles a door jamb and 
thousands of photographs taken in the ambassador hotel kitchen 
where kennedy was shot on june 5 1968 
an official record in the evidence showed that 2410 photographs 
were burned on aug 21 1968 it gives no reason 
also released was the police tape recording of a call reporting 
the shooting the caller did not immediately know who was shot but 
told the officer who answered that kennedy was in the hotel to 
which the unidentified officer replied big deal when told 
seconds later that kennedy had been shot the unidentified officer 
asked for the address of one of the biggest hotels in los angeles 
extensive videotape and audio recordings graphically depict the 
confusion at the scene the videotape shows a fatally wounded 
kennedy who moments before had declared victory in californias 
democratic presidential primary lying on the floor while 
witnesses and other victims appear dazed 
the shooting shooting occurred prior to secret service 
protection for presidential candidates 
one entire case of evidence contained items from sirhans 
pasadena home including the diary in which sirhan scrawled in 
pencil his plans to kill the new york senator 
my determination to eliminate rfk is becoming more the more of 
an unshakeable obsession he wrote rfk must die 
on the eve of the release of the files sirhans attorney luke 
mckissack said sirhan expects nothing to contradict his frequently 
stated claim that he was a lone gunman 
witnesses told of seeing sirhan step from behind a steam table 
into kennedys path as the senator walked toward him but los 
angeles county coroner thomas noguchi testified at sirhans 1969 
trial that kennedy was killed by a shot fired behind his right ear 
conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at 
kennedy from behind while sirhan stood in front 
mckissack said that although sirhan maintains he doesnt 
remember shooting kennedy sirhan a jordanian immigrant believes 
he was motivated by anger over the arab loss in the 1967 
arabisraeli war he blames his memory loss on alcohol 
mckissack said sirhan serving his life sentence at soledad 
prison has given up hope he will ever be paroled 
the release of the records follows years of demands for public 
access to the information 
the only things withheld from disclosure eu said were autopsy 
photos criminal rap sheets and fingerprint cards juvenile 
case records internal police personnel records and records that 
originated with the fbi or police departments outside los angeles 
burns said the fbi would release its own file at an unspecified 
time

israel deported eight more palestinians from 
the occupied lands to lebanon on tuesday including six involved in 
a stoning attack on teenage israeli hikers in a west bank village 
the army said 
in other developments ezer weizman a cabinet minister without 
portfolio said the assassination of plo military commander khalil 
alwazir last week may lead to more terrorism the army censored a 
newspaper editorial criticizing israels reported role in the 
killing 
army officials said for the first time that the april 6 attack 
on the hikers was planned a teenaged jewish settler and two 
palestinians were killed 
the officials said the planning was done by some of those in the 
group of deportees and described them as members of an outlawed 
palestine liberation organization youth group 
an army spokesman said soldiers set up roadblocks to stop arab 
residents of the occupied west bank and gaza strip from entering 
israel for two days beginning tuesday night 
he said the measure was aimed at preventing terror attacks on 
memorial day which began after nightfall tuesday and independence 
day which begins wednesday night and marks the 40th anniversary of 
the nations birth 
a palestinian died tuesday of wounds suffered the day before in 
a clash with soldiers in the pekoah a west bank village an army 
spokesman said 
at least 168 palestinians have been reported killed since riots 
began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza which israel has occupied 
since capturing them from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war an israeli soldier and civilian also have been slain 
curfews continued on 17 refugee camps and towns in the west bank 
and seven of eight refugee camps in gaza major cities also 
remained off limits to nonresidents including journalists 
hospital officials said a 16yearold palestinian was wounded 
during clashes in gaza city the army reported relative calm 
elsewhere 
there is no doubt that the number of disturbances has declined 
in the past three days said an army spokeswoman who attributed 
it to the clampdown 
three arabs have been killed since saturday when 15 died in 
riots that began with the news that alwazir had been killed in 
tunis 
tuesdays deportations brought to 20 the number expelled since 
the rebellion began six were from beita the west bank village 
where residents stoned 16 teenage jewish hikers from a nearby 
settlement and their two armed guards 
a 15yearold israeli girl tirza porat and two beita residents 
were killed in the clash an army report said ms porat was killed 
by a bullet fired from the weapon of one of the israeli guards 
initial reports said she had been stoned to death by palestinians 
col raanan gissin deputy army spokesman said one deportee 
njjah jamil saada daweikat led the hikers into the village 
previous reports said they followed after receiving promises of 
protection 
daweikat admitted inciting another villager to attack an israeli 
youth gissin said he added that another deportee mahmoud adnan 
banishamseh took the gun away from one of the israeli guards and 
did not surrender it until he was arrested several days later 
a military official who demanded anonymity said the six beita 
deportees were organizers in shabibeh an outlawed plo youth group 
for more than a month he claimed the group had run beita after 
declaring it a liberated village 
they had planned an attack on hikers in advance when this 
group came from the jewish settlement of elon moreh the 
opportunity presented itself they had planned to take a group into 
the village and hold them hostage he said 
the army bulldozed 14 houses of those who allegedly took part in 
the stoning one resident later was found to have tried to help the 
settlers and the army promised compensation 
according to the military official those deported were planners 
of attacks on civilians not stonethrowers they had planned it 
beforehand he said 
hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily al fajr predicted 
expulsion would inflame the situation and actually add to the 
determination of the palestinian people in their struggle for their 
national aspirations 
elias freij mayor of bethlehem said it had been proven that 
ms porat died from a bullet fired by a jewish guard and the 
deportees were innocent victims of provocation by the jewish 
settlers 
the united states has condemned deportations saying 
international law bans transfer across borders of civilians living 
in occupied zones 
on tuesday state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
criticized the latest expulsions israel says only mass 
deportations are illegal 
israeli sources say israeli commandos shot and killed alwazir 
at his home but the nations leaders have been silent on the 
subject 
nbctv reported the attack was approved at a cabinet meeting 
last week with dissenting votes cast by foreign minister shimon 
peres and weizman a former defense minister 
weizman declined to say if israel was responsible but told 
israel radio the killing would lead to more terrorism it 
distances the peace process and will bring greater hostility and 
make us more vulnerable around the world 
israels military censor took the unusual step of censoring an 
entire editorial in the yediot ahronot daily 
newspaper sources said the editorial dealt with israels role in 
alwazirs killing

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca 
americas highestpaid executive in 1986 earned nearly 18 million 
last year in salary cash and stock bonuses and options the 
automaker reported tuesday 
iacoccas earnings were part of the 852 million in 
compensation that executives of the no 3 automaker took home last 
year 
chrysler released the figures the day after it opened early 
contract talks with the united auto workers and union vice 
president mark stepp blasted the earnings as an incredible 
ripoff 
stepp who leads union negotiators in the talks said in a 
statement with uaw president owen bieber that the executives 
earnings blatantly contradict the message they try to send uaw 
members in their factories and offices 
iacoccas 1987 earnings of 179 million included nearly 135 
million from exercising stock purchase options granted earlier in 
the decade when chrysler was recovering from near ruin and its 
stock was worth a fraction of its present value 
iacocca also received 765890 in salary 725000 in cash 
bonuses 249000 in stock bonuses and a stock grant worth nearly 
27 million when it was issued dec 8 
the figures were contained in chryslers proxy statement mailed 
tuesday to shareholders 
in 1986 iacocca took home 206 million including 93 million 
on exercised stock options proxy statements released and compiled 
later in the year showed he was the nations highestpaid executive 
chryslers no 2 executive gerald greenwald received nearly 
66 million in 1987 including 560000 in salary and nearly 53 
million from exercising stock options greenwald is chairman of 
chrysler motors corp the companys automaking subsidiary 
in all chrysler paid out 852 million to 2035 executives in 
1987 779 million in cash more than 1 million in stock bonuses 
and nearly 63 million in retirement bonuses chrysler spokesman 
john guiniven said 
ford motor co vice chairman harold poling was the no 2 earner 
among big three auto executives receiving nearly 11 million 
808697 in salary 2 million in cash bonuses and 81 million 
earned exercising stock options 
roger b smith chairman of general motors corp topped gms 
earners last year with 22 million including 867000 in salary 
an estimated 800000 in stock bonuses 513000 in stock options 
and 56000 from a savings plan 
executive earnings at ford and gm were disclosed last week 
in their statement steep and bieber said the automakers 
pressure workers to reduce costs to match japanese auto companies 
but then justify stratospheric compensation for its executives 
the union said top officers in japanese companies earn about six 
to eight times what their factory workers make american executives 
receive salaries that are 12 to 18 times their workers pay the 
uaw said and total earnings are hundreds of times what workers 
receive when stock and cash bonuses are included 
in 1987 chrysler earned 129 billion down 72 percent from 
1986 fords earnings rose 40 percent last year to an 
industryrecord 46 billion gm the nations largest automaker 
earned 36 billion in 1987 up 22 percent 
chrysler workers have no profitsharing plan but are due to 
receive one under their next contract which will adopt a formula 
established at gm and ford last year 
gm paid no profitsharing for 1987 because it earned too little 
on its us auto operations to trigger payments gm eliminated its 
executive cash bonus plan in 1987 but gave out 1846 million in 
executive stock bonuses last year 
ford paid out a record 636 million in profitsharing for 1987 
averaging 4000 per worker ford also paid out a total of 2479 
million in 1987 cash bonuses to 5166 executives

israeli leaders privately expressed concern 
about jesse jacksons rising popularity but avoided saying 
publicly whom they want to see in the white house next year to 
avoid embarrassment after november elections 
political observers said israels favorite is vice president 
george bush 
bush would likely be best because he is a known quantity 
said political scientist rafaela bilsky of jerusalems hebrew 
university adding that democratic presidential hopeful michael 
dukakis is an unknown 
she said israeli leaders were not expected to voice their 
preference its a matter of political wisdom etiquette if we 
say who wed like then what happens if the other guy is elected 
she said 
in a recent interview rightwing prime minister yitzhak shamir 
refused to state his preference in the us presidential race 
all candidates have stated views on the arabisraeli conflict 
that conflict with the position of shamir who opposes territorial 
compromise with the arabs 
asked about the views of the presidential contenders shamir 
said i would prefer to discuss this with the people in the 
government he declined to elaborate 
some shamir associates however broke with tradition and 
expressed apprehension about prospects that jackson would run on 
the democratic ticket 
we have fears because mr jackson has said some very tough 
things about jews and voiced sympathy for the plo the palestine 
liberation organization legislator sarah doron of shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc said in a telephone interview 
ms doron refused to say which candidate she favored 
we prefer to refrain from interfering in the american 
elections just the same as i would expect any other country to 
refrain from interfering in our politics she said 
the israeli public has shown great interest in the us campaign 
and the local media have covered it extensively 
most commentaries focused on jacksons popularity debating what 
it means to the jewish state 
the masscirculation maariv daily called on american jews to 
vote against the democrats if jackson was on the ticket 
he has publicly embraced plo chief yasser arafat in many 
years there has not been such a prominent political leader in the 
united states who has shown such hostility toward jews in general 
and particularly toward israel the newspaper said in a recent 
editorial 
we hope that american jews will draw the proper conclusions 
about the party in which jesse jackson plays a key role 
an opinion column in the liberal haaretz daily however urged 
israeli leaders to accept jacksons status and open a dialogue with 
him because he is one of the most influential leaders in the 
democratic party 
most commentators agree the outcome of the november elections 
will have little influence on usisraeli ties 
it will only be a matter of whether things will be harder or 
easier ms bilsky said

this former coalmining community has 
taken the extraordinary step of filing for bankruptcy to get out 
from under a 450000 debt 
while a standingroomonly crowd watched the borough council 
voted 52 monday to file under chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy 
law which allows the community to hold off its creditors while it 
works out a plan to pay its debts 
allen dubroff a lawyer handling the bankruptcy filing said 
that the municipality is not the first in the nation to seek 
chapter 9 protection but that the tactic is rare 
council president william slezosky said the community of about 
7000 residents more than 60 percent of them retired or on fixed 
incomes cannot dig itself out of debt without help 
he blamed the boroughs debts on the previous administrations 
sloppy business practices and unwillingness to raise taxes or 
cut services while costs rose 
councilmen william phillips and john litwak voted against the 
move 
i dont relish bankruptcy said phillips he said the 
initial cost of filing is 25000 and the lawyers fee 195 an 
hour were not gaining anything all we are doing is taking 
taxpayers money and giving it to lawyers 
phillips said he would prefer that the borough borrow 425000 
to pay off its bills and then adopt some belttightening measures 
but slezosky said that require the borough to raise its real estate 
tax 60 percent 
one of the easiest things we could have done and we could 
have done it two months ago was to borrow 425000 but not come 
out of this for 10 years slezosky said 
a declaration of bankruptcy if aproved by a federal bankruptcy 
judge would prevent the internal revenue service from adding fines 
and penalties to the 122000 the borough owes in taxes withheld 
from employees paychecks 
slezosky said some of the paperwork for the reorganization plan 
such as a fiveyear tentative budget already has been prepared 
representatives of the state department of community affairs 
said last week that filing for bankruptcy automatically will place 
the borough under the agencys distressed communities program 
slezosky said he hopes the bankruptcy action will qualify the 
borough for state grants and nointerest loans available under that 
program 
the dca is expected to place some restrictions on how the 
borough spends money and levies taxes until its financial 
difficulties are resolved slezosky said 
dca spokesman fred reddig said the agency would ask borough 
officials to reconsider a bankruptcy filing until all avenues are 
exhausted through the states programs 
he said a bankruptcy filing would be the first his agency is 
aware of by a pennsylvania municipality 
borough records showed only a 69000 debt but an independent 
audit ordered in january by the councils new republican majority 
uncovered almost 400000 in unpaid bills from the past 
administration slezosky said 
a recent taxanticipation loan received to pay current bills 
pushed the boroughs total debt to about 450000 slezosky said

colombias armed forces have placed the country in 
a human rights emergency by extending repression to include not 
just leftists but anyone who does not support the military amnesty 
international said wednesday 
a report by the londonbased human rights group said colombia 
has entered a new phase of political repression that threatens its 
social fabric 
murder is purportedly the main cause of death among men between 
the ages of 1544 and many victims of political killings are 
tortured and then hideously disfigured both to prevent 
identification and to instill terror according to the report 
it states a policy of terror and political murder by the 
colombian armed forces which has already resulted in thousands of 
killings and disappearances in recent years now threatens the 
civic cultural and academic lifeblood of the country 
political repression in colombia has entered a new phase and 
the country is in the grip of a human rights emergency 
amnesty international said the new phase began last july with 
the publication of hit lists of prominent colombians and a wave 
of killings of students university lecturers and human rights 
leaders in the city of medellin 
medellin colombias second largest city is the base for a drug 
cartel which is considered responsible for much of the cocaine 
shipped to the united states 
the amnesty report asserts that largescale human rights 
violations in colombia stem from a deliberate policy of political 
murder by the armed forces 
it said increased human rights violations have occurred in the 
context of renewed guerrilla activity and pressure for social and 
political reform 
but since mid1987 the range of victims has extended far 
beyond leftwing opponents of the government the people now 
singled out are not only those who criticize the goivernment or the 
armed forces but also those who merely fail to support them 
whole sectors of society are at risk of being considered 
subversive and in colombia that is tantamount to a death 
sentence it adds 
the report quoted colombian human rights leaders as saying the 
government attributes the killings to uncontrollable civilian 
gunmen 
but hundreds of case studies show that killings and 
disappearances blamed on the death squads were in fact carried 
out by police and military personnel and their civilian 
auxiliaries acting on the authority of the army high command 
according to amnesty international 
perhaps the most conclusive evidence that the death squads 
are an integral part of the colombian security forces is the simple 
fact that no one has been prosecuted and convicted for the 
thousands of political killings and disappearances attributed to 
them it said 
the report said most of the 500 political prisoners freed under 
amnesty decrees in 1982 have been killed or exiled or have 
disappeared 
last year 15 members of a colombian human rights organization 
received death threats four were killed one disappeared and five 
fled the country the report said 
it quoted colombias national teachers union as saying more than 
300 members received death threats in 1987 and 15 were slain 
amnesty international said the government is responsible for 
human rights and it must bring the security forces under control

a little red lighthouse brought to life in a 
1942 childrens story was proposed for landmark status tuesday by a 
9yearold who clambered up to the microphone at a hearing to 
retell the tale of the proud beacon 
standing on a chair at the landmarks preservation commission 
hearing jonny goldin said that his father city comptroller 
harrison goldin read him the little red lighthouse and the great 
gray bridge when he was a little boy 
i found it hard to imagine it really existed jonny said at 
the city hall hearing but his father later took him to see it on 
the bank of the hudson river in the shadow of the george washington 
bridge in upper manhattan 
we should make sure that it is always there for boys and girls 
to enjoy forever jonny said 
supporters of making the 67yearold lighthouse known 
technically as jeffreys hook light a landmark say the beacon 
recalls the age of mariners in america and has special significance 
to children of all ages 
once a structure is designated a landmark changes in it require 
commission approval 
gene a norman commission chairman said it could take several 
months to examine staff studies before deciding whether the little 
red lighthouse should become a landmark 
the childrens story by hildegarde hoyt swift and lynd ward 
tells how the lighthouse coped with suddenly being overshadowed by 
the bridge 
you know the story jonny told the commission the 
lighthouse is proud of its job warning ships and tugboats and 
barges not to come too close to the rocky shore of the hudson 
river 
however the george washington bridge is built later the story 
goes and the beacon is in danger of being closed because the 
bridge has a warning light on one of its towers 
at the end of the book though the lighthouse is still seen 
as necessary for safe navigation and the bridge calls it little 
brother young goldin related 
real life wasnt as kind to the lighthouse six years after the 
1942 book was published the coast guard took the light out of 
service 
built in 1921 it was a replacement for a simple light pole with 
two 10candlepower oil lanterns the bridge opened in 1931 
the lighthouse is a cylindrical steel and castiron structure 
40 feet high and 14feet in diameter resting on a concrete slab 
it rises 61 feet above the water 
the commission also is considering a proposal to make a 
60foothigh pepsicola neon sign on the east river waterfront in 
queens a landmark 
built in 1936 it is considered by the commission staff to be an 
excellent example of neon display technology that began to 
transform outdoor advertising in the 1920s 
its designation as a landmark was opposed by queens borough 
president claire shulman who said it could delay development of a 
155 million project for residential commercial and recreational 
use of the area 
former parks commissioner gordon davis an attorney for pepsico 
inc asked for a delay in any designation so the soft drink firm 
could study the proposal

nbc won its third television season in a row 
tuesday and is already looking toward another win next season when 
its summer olympics coverage could give it a jump on the 
competition if the writers strike continues 
if the 6weekold strike isnt settled soon abc and cbs might 
not have new shows ready for air in september and could be forced 
to continue summer reruns and that could speed a continuing 
defection of viewers to cable and other alternatives 
nbc meanwhile will start the season with the historically 
highrated olympics and nbcs vice president for research projects 
gerald jaffe said tuesday that advertising interest in the olympics 
is picking up 
nbc topped off the season by winning the final week though the 
60th annual academy awards on abc was the no 1 show of the week 
according to the ac nielsen co figures for the week nbc had an 
average rating of 139 abc 135 and cbs 118 the rating is a 
percentage of the nations 886 million homes with television 
nbc ended the season with an average primetime rating of 160 
abc which had been third for three years running eked out second 
with a 137 thanks to the world series super bowl and winter 
olympics cbs was third for the first time ever with 135 the 
rating is a percentage of the nations 886 million households with 
televisions 
nbc had never won a season before 198586 this was nbcs 
biggest win yet and the biggest margin of victory for any network 
since cbs won in 196364 
but nielsen ratings showed the threenetwork average down 9 
percent from last year that figure was disputed by jaffe who said 
his own comparison of more extensive localmarket surveys showed a 
network decline of only 3 percent 
he attributed the discrepancy to inaccuracies in nielsens new 
people meter audience measurement system 
last week cbs released preliminary figures from a competing 
ratings company agb that showed cbs coming in slightly ahead of 
abc nielsen is still the ratings company used by advertisers to 
negotiate advertising rates though cbs has estimated that the 
lower people meter figures will cost the networks a combined 50 
million in advertising revenues 
the three networks have hired a consulting firm to scrutinize 
the new ratings system said bill rubens nbc vice president for 
research the results are expected sometime this summer 
whether 9 percent or 3 percent though the networks are losing 
viewers to cable independent stations and vcrs 
jaffe said the decline is reversible if networks can put on 
enough popular shows like the cosby show which increased total 
network viewing on thursday night 
the 3 percent is not immutable jaffe said there is no 
law of nature that says the networks will decline 3 percent every 
year ad infinitum 
the cosby show was the no 1rated show for the third year 
in a row followed by its spinoff a different world nbcs 
cheers and golden girls abcs growing pains whos 
the boss nbcs night court cbs 60 minutes and 
murder she wrote and abcs new show the wonder years

police have bought powerful motorcycles to battle 
a moscow motorcycle gang called the rockers that has caused 
accidents and disturbed residents of the capital tass reported 
tuesday 
the official news agency said police purchased germanmade bmw 
motorcycles that can travel up to 136 mph but it did not say how 
many 
tass said the rockers will not be able to escape police pursuers 
because their motorcycles are no match for the bmws 
it quoted n kurbatov a captain of the police unit assigned to 
stop the gang as saying his officers concentrate in moscows hot 
spots where motorhooligans prowl the streets with the noise 
of their machines awaking residents 
the rockers become active with the onset of warm days tass 
said beginning april 1 a day hasnt gone by when because of 
them there hasnt been a traffic accident with casualties in these 
accidents not only the hotheads suffer but also passengers sitting 
behind their backs as a rule minors who like to ride with the 
wind 
it said 10000 people are killed yearly in motorcycle accidents 
throughout the soviet union 
the agency said that since the beginning of april moscow police 
have detained 62 supermen on motorcycles for lacking proper 
documents license plates or mufflers and for speeding or ignoring 
traffic signs 
last year moscows automobile clubs youth organizations and 
the city council tried unsucessfully to persuade the rockers to 
join official organizations or ride in designated areas where they 
wouldnt disturb anyone 
now that they rejected this and that maybe thats enough 
persuasion tass said its time to move on to legal action

prime minister sadek mahdi said tuesday 
that sudan was saturated with refugees and he would not accept 
the expected influx of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from 
neighboring ethiopia 
western relief officials expressed fear there could be heavy 
loss of life among ethiopias refugees 
mahdi said he discussed the situation with ethiopias marxist 
government and with the un office of high commissioner for 
refugees and other relief organizations he said the talks were 
aimed at organizing aid shipments to the affected people in the 
tigre and eritrea regions in northern ethiopia or at setting up 
camps inside ethiopia near the border with sudan 
secessionist warfare in the two regions complicates delivery of 
relief to millions of people suffering because of famine and 
drought 
in a 30minute interview at his khartoum headquarters the prime 
minister told the associated press 
we think that sudan has been saturated and we cannot take any 
more refugees 
he said he made that known last october 
the un agency estimates there are around 900000 refugees in 
sudan including 677000 ethiopians sudan puts the figure at close 
to 2 million 
mahdi was elected prime minister in april 1986 a year after a 
military coup overthrew president gaafar nimeiri 
western relief officials here speaking on condition of 
anonymity say from 2 million to 3 million ethiopians in tigre and 
eritrea will be affected by an expected ethiopian government 
offensive against rebels the officials expect refugees by the 
hundreds of thousands to move toward eastern sudan within the next 
month 
they said there is no stockpile of relief food in the 
droughtaffected areas the ethiopian government recently banned 
relief organizations from working in the northern zones 
mahdi said sudan suggested it can help relief agencies send food 
to tigre and eritrea across the sudanese border or set up camps 
within ethiopian territory to receive refugees 
one relief official said he feared that once the rainy season 
begins next month it would be extremely difficult to move enough 
food aid to eastern sudan to handle the expected influx whether it 
was in sudanese or ethiopian territory 
we will be hamstrung and there could be large numbers of 
fatalities the official said 
over the weekend mahdi handed in his cabinets resignation to 
form a new coalition government representing a greater number of 
political parties the fiveman sovereign council which acts in 
place of a president accepted the cabinets resignation but kept 
mahdi in power so he could form a new cabinet 
mahdi said the new coaltion will include his centrist umma 
party the centrist democratic unionist party ummas coaltion 
partner for the past two years the moslem national islamic front 
the southern parties and the small national sudanese party 
mahdi discussing sudans own war in the south said he hoped 
improving relations with ethiopia would gradually lead to an end of 
ethiopian aid to the rebel group the sudan peoples liberation army 
the rebels are asking for greater autonomy as well as economic 
and administrative reforms 
in addis ababa the capital of ethiopia the government said 
un aid workers can resume drought relief operations in the 
wartorn north but more than 50 other western workers remain barred 
from the region an official there said tuesday 
the policy reversal affects only four of 60 western relief 
workers 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in washington 
the ethiopian decision was a positive development its 
important however to permit a wide range of private voluntary 
organizations to work in the area if the needs of those at risk are 
to be met

iran on tuesday complained to the united 
nations about us attacks in the persian gulf where the us navy 
destroyed or disabled two iranian oil platforms and six naval 
vessels the day before 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said iran has the 
right to retaliate by any means available for the american acts 
of war and direct participation on behalf of iraq iran 
and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
the united states defended its action as necessary and 
proportionate to the threat posed by iranian actions it told the 
security council that us forces exercised their inherent right 
of selfdefense 
a letter from us ambassador herbert s okun released tuesday 
said the american actions were against legitimate military 
targets and the united states does not seek a military 
confrontation with iran 
ali akbar velayati the iranian foreign minister made his 
complaint by letter he asked secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar and the security council to condemn this american act of 
aggression 
it is also expected that immediate preventative measures are 
taken to stop the future recurrence of such crimes said the 
letter published tuesday as a un document it said iran will 
under no circumstances surrender to the politics of force and 
manipulation and will certainly not leave this latest act of 
injustice unanswered 
velayatis letter cited the attacks on the oil platforms which 
it called premeditated acts of aggression by the warmonger 
us administration 
american attacks simply indicate a plan by both the united 
states and iraq to aggress against iran to divert attention from 
the heinous war crimes of iraq particularly the chemical 
bombing the letter said 
president reagan ordered the platforms attacked as retaliation 
for a mine that damaged a us warship last week and wounded 10 
crew members 
okuns letter said us forces have exercised their inherent 
right of selfdefense under international law by taking defensive 
action in response to an attack by the islamic republic of iran 
against a us naval vessel in international waters the 
actions taken are necessary and proportionate to the threat posed 
by such hostile iranian actions 
it referred to iranian minelaying and said us forces 
attacked military targets which have been used for attacks 
against nonbelligerent shipping in international waterways of the 
gulf the united states said the platforms were used as bases for 
iranian speedboats that attack neutral vessels 
mahallati rejected the claim of selfdefense and called the 
attacks on oil platforms nothing more than premeditated armed 
reprisal 
he challenged the united states to produce evidence that the 
mines were laid by iran and declared there is no doubt that 
iraq and its agents have been mining the commercial lanes of the 
gulf

tons of soviet supplies including 
arms and ammunition are being flown into kabul as soviet troops 
prepare to withdraw western diplomatic sources said tuesday 
the diplomats speaking in islamabad on condition of anonymity 
said their contacts in the afghan capital reported nightly arrivals 
of soviet an12 and il76 transports at the kabul airport the past 
week 
they said the mood in kabul generally was calm in the wake of 
the april 14 signing of an accord in switzerland for the withdrawal 
of the estimated 115000 soviet military personnel in afghanistan 
the sources reported east european diplomats were saying the 
soviet troops probably would first pull back from the eastern area 
of afghanistan when the withdrawal begins may 15 the soviets sent 
troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to help the marxist 
government fight anticommunist rebels 
although the soviets are to withdraw under the geneva agreement 
the civil war is expected to continue rebel leaders said they 
would fight on and america plans to continue providing aid to the 
rebels while the soviets support government forces 
the western diplomats said some of the new soviet supplies are 
beging moved south of kabul in truck convoys possibly for storage 
there also have been reports of heavy fighting east and south of 
the capital 
the sources said that on april 11 a soviet convoy with more 
than 450 vehicles including tanks mobile rocket launchers and 
other armored equipment headed for logar province immediately 
south of kabul 
guerrilla activity has intensified this spring in provinces 
bordering pakistan according to various reports 
the rebels usually launch operations as the winter snow melts 
but guerrilla leaders vowed this year to step up the war because of 
the geneva accord that was framed without their participation 
prospects of a soviet pullout have strengthened the afghan 
currency to 167 afghanis to the dollar compared to 210 in february 
possibly in anticipation of a strong demand from returning 
refugees the sources said 
they also said the price of russian vodka on the local market 
has doubled in recent weeks to the equivalent of 750 a bottle 
with soviet personnel apparently stocking up before returning home

pennsylvania the next state in the 
democratic presidential marathon may well offer a smooth path for 
frontrunner michael dukakis but for rival jesse jackson the april 
26 primary is strewn with obstacles 
we could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates 
lamented jackson delegate coodinator steve cobble 
pennsylvanias popular vote is merely a beauty contest and the 
real winner in the primary must succeed in direct delegate 
elections in the states 23 congressional districts a prize of 178 
delegates fourth largest of any state is at stake 
jacksons core support is concentrated in three districts in 
philadelphia and pittsburgh the states two largest cities and 
home to most of the states blacks blacks make up about 11 percent 
of the voting age population 
though turnout there may be the highest in the state and jackson 
could pull close to dukakis in the overall popular vote the 
delegate races likely will swing overwhemlingly to dukakis 
observers say 
these direct delegate elections are unfair to blacks its one 
of the last vestiges of republicantype politics in the democratic 
party and it ought to be done away with cobble said 
personal popularity of the individual delegate candidates 
doesnt count for much since the name of the presidential hopeful 
appears beside each committed delegate candidate 
dukakis was the only democrat to field a complete slate of 116 
jacksons campaign in contrast has only 79 district delegate 
candidates and has turned to delegatecandidates pledged to former 
contender rep richard gephardt of missouri and other former 
candidates to fill out the gaps the remaining 62 delegates will be 
apportioned in june according to the district outcomes 
some political veterans say jackson could win no more than 30 
delegates 
even in a best scenario how he jackson gets more than 30 
delegates i dont know g terry madonna director of the center 
for politics and public affairs at millersville university 
state democratic chairman larry yatch who along with gov 
robert p casey is neutral in the race doesnt think jacksons 
slatefilling effort will be fruitful 
but jacksons campaign said late tuesday afternoon it has 
commitments from eight to 10 delegates of departed candidates to 
support jackson and is working on more 
jackson will win philadelphia where he is endorsed by mayor w 
wilson goode and rep bill gray but dukakis is favored everywhere 
else yatch said pittsburgh mayor richard caliguiri and erie mayor 
louis tullio both have endorsed dukakis 
the latest preprimary poll conducted thursday through sunday 
by the pittsburgh postgazette and philadelphia daily news showed 
dukakis with a 59 percent to 20 percent edge over jackson gore 
fell far back at 9 percent the survey of 647 likely democratic 
voters had a margin of error of 5 percent 
mike is taking nothing for granted said dukakis 
pennsylvania spokesman pat mccarthy he said a win could put mike 
over the psychological top on the road to the nomination 
a strong showing in new york would help jackson in pennsylvania 
but dukakis is favored right now delegate coordinator cobble said 
jackson who won 16 percent of the vote and 18 delegates in the 
threeway 1984 presidential primary hopes to woo disaffected blue 
collar workers particularly in southwestern pennsylvania where 
unemployment still runs into double digits in some areas 
statewide he is hoping at least to duplicate his record of 
attracting 15 percent to 20 percent of the white vote 
well do better than in 1984 exceed expectations and give 
dukakis a hell of a run for his money said janice fine a 
national campaign aide were very competitive in pennsylvania 
democratic lt gov mark singel also neutral disagreed 
the more likely scenario is that dukakis uses pennsylvania to 
solidify his frontrunnership his hold on the nomination singel 
said 
gores moderate stands should have meshed with pennsylvanias 
voters who gave the state to ronald reagan both in 1980 and 1984 
and who havent elected a democrat to the us senate since 1962 
in fact gore was endorsed as the most electable of the candidates 
by the state senate democratic leadership but gore hasnt won 
anywhere since super tuesday in his native south and the new york 
primary results could signal the end of his campaign 
there is also a republican race at least on paper but vice 
president george bush is expected to easily brush aside his only 
remaining rival pat robertson in the contest for 78 delegates

half a million customers in quebec were without 
electricity for several hours tuesday in the aftermath of the 
provinces worst power blackout ever 
engineers at hydroquebec the provincially owned utility giant 
struggled to explain the outage which began at 809 pm edt monday 
when ice knocked out a major transmission line from labrador 
the failure left at least 4 million customers in quebec new 
brunswick and scattered areas of northern maine and vermont without 
electricity for up to seven hours 
with three major power installations still off line tuesday 
hydroquebec appealed to quebecers to conserve electricity 
utility spokesman jacquesandre couture said a key question was 
why an automatic relay switch failed to work when the power lines 
from churchill falls labrador went down the switch should have 
confined the outage to northern quebec 
another mystery was why a power station at beauharnois near 
montreal continued to feed power to new york state instead of 
fulfilling its role as a backup power supply for the quebec system 
couture said the blackout cost hydroquebec 3 million 24 
million us in revenue 
it was the tenth systemwide outage for hydroquebec in 15 years 
officials conceded that neighboring new england utilities have a 
better record 
they are designing their system with criteria which are more 
severe than ours said jeanclaude roy a hydroquebec vice 
president 
he said the company plans to spend 600 million 486 million 
us to upgrade the quebec grid 
quebec energy minister john caccia said he is not worried that 
the incident will damage hydroquebecs growing export market in 
new england and new york 
i didnt get any phone calls from our american clients he 
said 
the initial outage stranded hundreds of passengers in the 
montreal subway and in elevators the national hockey league 
playoff game between the montreal canadiens and the boston bruins 
was plunged into temporary darkness at the montreal forum but 
resumed under emergency lighting montreal won 52

vice president george bush said tuesday he 
expects to face the winner of the new york democratic primary 
michael dukakis in the fall general election 
its a good bet i think bush told reporters traveling with 
him on air force ii 
he also defended supporter frank rizzo former philadelphia 
mayor and denied that rizzo could cost him the votes of blacks 
im certainly not going to write off the ethnic community in 
this country because of a prejudiced view toward rizzo he said 
he said he had no hesitation to appear with rizzo 
he noted that in his last unsuccessful campaign for mayor rizzo 
had lost narowly 
to have people suggest that i should not appear with him 
because im worried that will hurt me in some other area i 
reject it as invalid liberal trash 
its reverse discrimination bush told reporters 
on the new york primary bush said i do think that whoever 
wins in new york will win the democratic nomination 
bush said he did not intend to criticize dukakis right away i 
think ill keep it generic until the convention he said 
however he referred to dukakis as an oldworld liberal 
democrat 
earlier with rizzo at his side bush told a republican rally in 
philadelphia i want to take on whichever one of those democrats 
wins today in new york and whip them in the fall 
at stops earlier in the day bush reiterated strong support for 
the american military strikes against irans forces 
speaking to the pennsylvania state association of township 
supervisors bush said support for the us military response has 
crossed partisan lines both in congress and around the world 
im proud to have stood with the president and in support of 
the president bush said 
in an interview with local reporters bush said one has to 
keep ones options entirely open for possible future steps in the 
gulf 
bush was asked whether arms the reagan administration secretly 
sold to iran in an effort to free hostages had been used against 
the united states or its allies in recent days democratic 
presidential contender jesse jackson has hinted that such arms were 
used 
im not sure theyve used them against us he said however 
he added some of the weapons used in this exchange likely came 
from an inventory of weapons from a time when we were 
strongly in support of a much more moderate iran than we have 
today 
back in the shahs of iran days we had a very active 
program bush said there is a certain historical irony to it 
on the day of the new york primary where he was running 
virtually unopposed bush campaigned across pennsylvania and said 
he doesnt care which nominee democrats choose 
i cant wait for the fall i cant wait for the debates with 
the democratic nominee no matter who he turns out to be even if 
they unleash mario cuomo i cant wait bush told a morning 
republican fundraiser in lancaster 
the new york governer has said he would not accept a draft even 
in the event of a brokered democratic convention 
bush got a special tour of the hershey chocolate factory and ate 
lunch in the plant cafeteria with workers he was also presented 
with a twofoot chocolate seal of the vice presidents office 
eat your heart out he joked with reporters 
bush had planned to return to washington for a national security 
council meeting on the persian gulf in early afternoon but changed 
his plans and stayed in pennsylvania when the meeting was cancelled 
he also had evening events planned in the philadelphia area 
things have quieted down said spokesman peter teeley 
he feels hes fully informed on what going on and doesnt 
need to remain in washington teeley said 
bush also reiterated his plans for establishing an ethics office 
in the white house if elected 
im personally concerned with the breeches of ethics ive seen 
over the past years bush said when a congressman goes bad or 
a member of the executive branch betrays the trust you know i know 
it hurts he told a gop fundraiser in lancaster 
but he told reporters later in hershey please dont 
interpret that as criticism of attorney general ed meese 
democrats are going to try to make some political mileage on 
the sleeze issue bush added let them try theres plenty 
on the other side 
bush also told reporters he had not yet begun the process of 
deciding upon a running mate brushing aside questions on whether 
former pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh might be under 
consideration 
the former governor now director of the institute of government 
at harvard university accompanied bush on his pennsylvania swing 
theres no list long or short bush declared

new york gov mario cuomo complained tuesday 
that scrapping over mideast issues overshadowed equally important 
matters during the states democratic primary race 
we didnt hear about aids we didnt hear about drugs cuomo 
said we didnt hear about homelessness we didnt have a 
discussion on inf intermediaterange nuclear forces 
the governor said the primary won by massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis did not bring about a full ventilation of all the 
issues 
if you could get a composite new york voter and read his or 
her mind they would say were disappointed he told reporters 
at the state capitol 
the governor also said however that his states primary was 
not as divisive as some observers said it was 
it is not accurate to say that this was an extremely negative 
campaign that is simply not accurate it is not accurate to say 
that there were obvious signs of severe racial tension he said 
jesse jackson and mike dukakis were quick to state 
that aside from the mayors comments there was no harsh criticism 
from any political leaders cuomo said 
i saw no fruit thrown i heard no ugly epithets from crowds i 
saw no disorderly conduct i saw no one unruly at debates i saw no 
one struck or even abused in any way he said 
the governor said the middle east is a very important issue 
but one that seemed to have an eclipsing effect 
mideast issues of major concern to the states large bloc of 
jewish voters were magnified when new york city mayor edward i 
koch endorsed tennessee sen albert gore jr in large part because 
of gores proisrael stance 
koch said jews would have to be crazy to vote for jesse 
jackson because of his attitudes toward israel and a palestinian 
state

rural north florida community tuesday killing four people 
destroying homes throwing people from their beds and leaving much 
of a college campus in ruins 
only rubble was left in some neighborhoods after the tornado cut 
a swath 12 miles long and at least a halfmile wide about 430 am 
eighteen people suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment the 
mobile home of two of those who were killed vanished from its lot 
leaving only foundation blocks 
families were thrown out of bed while windows exploded and their 
homes collapsed on top of them 
i woke up with a roaring sound and as soon as i woke up the 
windows blew out on both sides of my bed and the roof came down on 
top of me said mitchell may who was pinned in the debris for 
three hours 
his neighbor diane dempsey said she and her husband pat had 
only moments to rush their three children ages 4 to 11 into the 
bathroom before the tornado hit 
they were screaming are we dying are we dying she said 
then it was over as soon as it started 
it was floridas worst tornado since 1966 when a twister crossed 
the state from clearwater to cape kennedy killing 11 and injuring 
400 people in 1962 a tornado on the florida panhandle killed 17 
people and injured 100 
gov bob martinez flew to inspect the scene and said he intended 
to sign an emergency order allowing state and federal aid 
its been tragic said martinez 
lawmen from the state and surrounding counties were already on 
hand and state prisoners were expected soon to help with the 
cleanup said sheriff joe peavy 
the twisters destructive path started in front of a shopping 
center and headed straight into north florida community college 
where it totaled the new library and took the roof off the 
auditorium peavy said

neighborhood near madison 
i almost fell to my knees it was so strong said otis 
williams 69 his sons home across the street was destroyed 
also in pinetta the bodies of robert and lavelle mccullough 
were thrown 100 yards and their mobile home disappeared leaving 
behind only a dozen cinder blocks on a bare patch of ground 
mrs mcculloughs sister dorothy butler of nearby jennings

cardinal john oconnor of new york said tuesday he 
hoped his visit would advance political as well as church relations 
between cuba and the united states 
he also said that years of religious restrictions in cuba had 
not hurt the spirit of its worshipers 
the roman catholic prelate the first american cardinal to 
visit cuba since fidel castro came to power in 1959 hugged 
archbishop jaime ortega of havana after stepping off the private 
plane that brought him to jose marti airport from santiago cuba 
he also shook hands with jose felipe carneado a member of the 
communist partys central committee 
oconnor described his day in santiago 430 miles away as 
wonderful and spoke glowingly of the reception he received at 
the mass he celebrated there monday night 
the moment we arrived they burst into thunderous applause 
and the applause hardly stopped throughout the entire mass they 
applauded everything and it was all spontaneous he said 
it was clear they were overjoyed by our visit and that the 
faith is very very deep 
oconner added despite the fact that there have been many 
restrictions in the past on the free exercise of their faith its 
there its still there 
the cardinal said much of the enthusiasm was due to the presence 
of monsignor raul del valle of the new york archdiocese who was a 
priest in havana before going to the united states in 1961 
it was del valles first visit to cuba since he left 
oconnor was invited here by cuban bishops to celebrate the 
200th anniversary of the birth of felix varela a cuban priest who 
served in new york city from 182353 
it is my hope that felix varela will form a bridge a bridge 
between the church in cuba and the church in new york and who 
knows when there is a strong bridge between the two churches then 
perhaps many others can go back and forth across that bridge and 
other kinds of peaceful reunion may take place between two 
peoples who are separated by such a small body of water and who 
together dream of peace the new york archbishop said 
oconnor arrived in cuba one day after the 27th anniversary of 
the castro governments victory at the bay of pigs over invading 
anticommunist cuban exile forces who were backed by the united 
states when asked if it concerned him he said oh is that 
right i didnt even think of that 
he added well pray for everybody who was involved and for 
all who lost their lives 
it wasnt known if the cardinal would meet with castro during 
his three days in havana his schedule includes private meetings 
with religous leaders 
in 1985 a group of american archbishops met castro during a 
visit to cuba 
it would be very presumptuous of me to suggest i would be 
seeing him oconnor said but he added anyone visiting any 
country is always available when the president of the country 
wishes to see him 
oconnor said his visit and that of other religious leaders to 
cuba in recent years indicated significant movement by the 
cuban government in religious affairs and he indicated he would be 
taking careful notes to report to the vatican 
pope john paul ii is scheduled to visit latin america this year 
i would be surprised if the holy father did not want to try to 
visit cuba sometime in the future oconnor said i am unaware 
of any concrete plans but clearly the holy see would observe 
carefully the visit of any cardinal to any country to see how he 
was received and what the response was on the part of the 
government 
of cubas 102 million people an estimated 41 percent are roman 
catholic

support from jewish voters and a strong boost 
from white catholics lifted michael dukakis to victory in the new 
york primary tuesday while jesse jacksons support came chiefly 
from black voters polls said 
racial division was a prominent feature of the race with 
jackson winning a huge proportion of the black vote but just a 
moderate share of white votes polls said still jacksons white 
vote was more than twice its 1984 level 
dukakis threequarter share of the jewish vote countered 
jacksons black support and jackson led well but not 
overwhelmingly among hispanics polls said that left catholic 
whites as a swing vote and many chose dukakis 
in incomplete returns abc newswashington post and nbc news 
exit polls said dukakis won about 70 percent of the white catholic 
vote roughly 75 percent of the jewish vote and 60 percent of the 
smaller group of white protestants the numbers could change 
slightly as final results came in 
jackson won about 95 percent of the black vote which made up 
about a quarter of the democratic turnout the abcpost nbc and 
cbs newsnew york times polls said jews and white catholics each 
made up about 25 percent of the total as well 
the jewish and black cancel each other out then the ethnic 
catholic white vote is an important balance said pollster ia 
lewis of the los angeles times it is going very strongly for 
dukakis 
racial and religious antipathy marked the primary race mayor 
edward i koch said jews would have to be crazy to support 
jackson because of his position on israel and polls indicated 
that bad blood lingered 
in early results from the los angeles times exit poll nearly 
twothirds of the democratic voters said they believed there was 
an element of racism involved in the vote against jackson 
while about another third said they believed jackson is 
antisemitic 
theres a very strong racial element here bitter racial 
antagonism id say lewis said 
abc news pollster doug muzzio called it a dual electorate in 
which dukakis won every demographic and socioeconomic group when 
blacks were factored out 
its the same old song blacks voting overwhelmingly for 
jackson whites less monolithic but still in this case solidly 
for dukakis he said 
the nbc news poll said jackson won just 18 percent of the 
nonjewish white vote abc had it at roughly onefifth which would 
be about the same he got in the last two primaries wisconsin and 
connecticut among all whites jews included the polls had jackson 
with about 15 percent 
as expected black turnout was highest in new york city 
accounting for 34 percent of the total in the nbc news poll 
muzzio noted an element of negative voting in the returns 
about a fifth of the voters said they were casting their ballots to 
stop a candidate from winning rather than to help a candidate they 
liked threequarters of those negative voters went for dukakis he 
said 
there was some weakness in the support for dukakis nbcs poll 
said more than half his supporters wished someone else were 
running and the cbstimes poll said 72 percent of dukakis voters 
said they would have voted for gov mario cuomo if he had been in 
the race 
moreover only one in five blacks tells us that dukakis really 
cares about people like them and only three in 10 blacks have a 
favorable view of dukakis said nbc news poll chief laurily 
epstein so hes got his work cut out in that community 
late preelection polls gave dukakis a lead of 9 points or more 
but pollsters stressed that turnout was the key chiefly whether 
nonjewish whites would turn out and boost dukakis or weaken him by 
staying home 
fully onethird of the voters told nbc they had made their 
decision in the last seven days of the race 57 percent of them 
went for dukakis 23 percent for jackson and 19 percent for gore 
most of jacksons voters 70 percent made up their minds more 
than a month ago and 80 percent backed him strongly nbc said but 
only half of his supporters said they thought the nation was ready 
to elect a black president 
nbc said liberal voters went for jackson by a slim margin 48 
percent to 44 percent for dukakis liberals made up 44 percent of 
the total the poll said moderates a third of the total favored 
dukakis over jackson by 5631 conservatives 12 percent of the 
total split 5623 
jackson did better with younger voters the polls said dukakis 
better with the older those most concerned with issues such as 
drug abuse or helping the poor and elderly backed jackson those 
concerned with the federal deficit and experience in office favored 
dukakis 
preelection polls never showed much movement toward sen albert 
gore jr of tennessee his peak was 12 percent in a cbs poll late 
last week after his endorsement by koch he did best among 
conservative democrats the cbstimes poll said but was third even 
there to dukakis and jackson 
gore just didnt play well here at all said pama mitchell 
a cbs poll analyst 
the polls had a margin of sampling error of about 4 percentage 
points

sen albert gore jr said i guess this was 
somebody elses super tuesday as new yorkers turned thumbs down 
on his candidacy and he considered quitting the democratic 
presidential race 
tennessee gov ned mcwherter a close friend and adviser said 
the senator was weighing an end to his campaign after six weeks 
without a primary or caucus win gore scheduled an announcement 
thursday 
i told him he should gracefully get out and let this one 
conclude mcwherter said from nashville tenn 
mcwherter said ive always been a person when reality rears 
its head recognize it but do it gracefully and then go get a shoe 
shine 
gore spokesman arlie schardt told reporters here i know the 
senator hasnt made up his own mind he has to talk to his advisers 
and close friends 
but gore dropped his attack stance of late and sounded a call 
for unity as he spoke to supporters in new york where he finished 
a dismal third 
i guess this was somebody elses super tuesday he said i 
want to congratulate mike dukakis for a really impressive victory 
new york is a real marathon and he beat us by a mile and i want to 
congratulate jesse jackson for another tremendous showing i never 
wanted to stop mike dukakis or stop jesse jackson i just wanted to 
start al gore 
here in new york and all across this country in november 
the democratic partys going to be unified and were going to stop 
george bush this november 
gore called mcwherter from new york where he was awaiting the 
results of that states presidential primary 
he told me things were not good in new york i told him to use 
his own judgement said mcwherter who coordinated gores 
southern campaign for super tuesday 
mcwherter declined to say whether gore will drop out or not 
al gore has worked hard for a year and i dont think he needs 
a big fat governor making the announcement for him he said 
i need to let him make that decision i should not make any 
suggestions of what he plans to do mcwherter said 
in ohio gore state director rob mulligan said national campaign 
officials were reviewing the returns from new york before making a 
decision 
what ive been told is the campaign will see what it looks 
like tonight and the senator will talk to his advisers to see what 
direction the campaign will take mulligan said

refused to turn over their film of the incident 
turner said that in spite of mondays violence his department 
had no intention of preventing members of the nation of islam from 
resuming their patrols 
were not going to do anything to restrict their activities

counts of simple assault and one count of theft but the charges 
were changed tuesday to one count of robbery in connection with the

pursuit of a drug pusher said abdul alimmohammed a nation of 
islam spokesman we apologize 
turner who previously has said that he wants to train civilians 
to become parttime reserves to help his officers fight crime 
pledged to talk with the group to iron out rules of conduct 
we do not want them taking the law into their own hands he 
said we have to work within the realm of the law

contra leaders tuesday held out little hope that a 
peace agreement with the sandinistas could be reached within the 
60day timetable established march 23 but hailed the first round of 
talks as a triumph 
the contra directors returned from managua on monday night after 
three days of peace negotiations with the sandinista government 
the two sides did not reach an agreement but decided to meet again 
for three days beginning april 28 
what the sandinista government wants is an absence of war 
without eliminating the causes of war said adolfo calero one of 
the five directors of the nicaraguan resistance as the rebels are 
formally called 
he said the contras will continue to insist on steps toward 
democracy before they agree to lay down their arms 
but he and directors alfredo cesar and pedro joaquin chamorro 
jr hailed the visit itself as a victory pointing out the 
sandinistas originally refused to meet face to face 
our arrival in managua after everything the sandinistas said 
was a triumph said calero 
the resistance is creating a unique precedent in latin 
america said cesar we are an intact guerrilla force 
negotiating in the capital without giving up our troops or our 
arms 
there are difficult problems to solve before the negotiations 
can be completed the contra leaders said saying the timetable 
agreed to in sapoa nicaragua last month probably cannot be met 
and will be extended 
he dismissed questions about the sandinistas sincerity saying 
they had no choice but to negotiate because their political 
position inside nicaragua was weak 
calero noted that when the rebels toured the capitals streets 
in a small bus nicaraguans cheered saluted and flashed them v 
signs

hundreds of millions of people probably engage in activity that 
leaves them vulnerable says the head of the world health

arvind kumar should be the envy of most 
book publishers 
as director of indias national book trust 44yearold kumar 
heads an organization with a potential market of 283 million 
indians 
but not too many would like to work kumars sevenday week as he 
tries to juggle 13 indian languages and keep ahead of critics who 
say the trust publishes too few books in any one of them 
the trust was set up in 1957 to produce and encourage the 
production of good literature at moderate prices a sweeping 
objective considering the size of the reading public and the 
diversity of languages 
indias 800 million people speak more than 1600 dialects and 
15 languages are listed as official in the countrys constitution 
the 13 in which the trust publishes rant state 
some of indias languages little known outside the country are 
spoken by more people than some european tongues sixty million 
people speak marathi and 62 million telegu almost as many as the 
63 million people who speak italian in italy and far more than the 
11 million who speak greek or the 9 million in sweden who speak 
that language 
the trusts translations of indian works include such books as 
tin malayalam natak and the punjabi version of three 
malayalam plays set in the shady jungles of kerala 
the translation involves a change in script indias languages 
also are written in 13 different scripts and sees the book 
traveling 1240 miles north to the dusty plains of punjab where 
kumar says it is doing good business 
good business because the punjabi translation adds 14 million 
potential buyers to the 22 million malayalamspeaking population a 
translation of a book from any other indian language to hindi the 
national language adds 153 million people to the potential market 
the trust has recently published a book of punjabi folk tales in 
urdu the telugu novel what was left in punjabi and the hindi 
novel darkness in urdu gujarati marathi and tamil the story 
about indias partition became a popular tv series 
the trust also publishes many books in english which though not 
an official indian language is spoken by most educated indians 
these range from historical works such as a biography of guru 
nanak the first prophet of indias sikh faith to books about 
indias rivers its hindu temples and its orchids 
despite its exotic output the trust has received severe 
criticism a government committee complained the organization had 
published only 3101 books since 1957 and has spent most of its 
funds on staff salaries the trust receives a 3 million grant from 
the government 
there were heavy losses due to underpricing and incorrect 
pricing of its publications the government review said 
kumar agrees but only in part he says more books should have 
been published and he is planning a 70 percent increase in 
production this year which would add 250 titles 
but we are not a commercial enterprise he says there 
will be losses because the books are underpriced as per government 
orders 
the increase in production kumar says is only a token effort 
to tackle the problem its like a few drops of rain in a 
desert 
most of the additional titles will be in english and hindi but 
efforts will be made to increase translations into other indian 
languages for what kumar calls unifying the country through 
literature 
language has been a prickly subject in india riots have broken 
out in south india over what people view as the forcible imposition 
of hindi which is mainly spoken in the countrys north 
the trust steers clear of potential disputes by appointing 
advisory boards for each language to decide which books to publish 
the trusts other responsibilities include participating in the 
governments plans to make 80 million more indians literate by 
1995 this means providing books for primary schools and adult 
education centers in more than 500 cities and towns only 35 
percent of indias people can now read and write 
but kumar says the trust by itself cannot fulfill the 
governments literacy campaign 
we can support it but we cannot hug it too hard he says 
we cannot succeed on our own we have to float on a current and 
that current will have to come from the people

the idea of remaking alfred hitchcocks 
psychological thriller suspicion might one day prove 
interesting but the makers of the new version airing on pbs 
tonight produced only a pointless replica 
the new suspicion part of the pbs series american 
playhouse stars jane curtin and anthony andrews in the joan 
fontainecary grant roles 
except for a 1980s veneer nothing is changed including the 
studio ending that hitchcock said he deplored so why didnt these 
filmmakers do something daring like give the film the ending 
hitchcock said he wanted 
suspicion is the story of a dowdy young woman facing 
spinsterhood who is swept off her feet by a handsome neerdowell 
bachelor she marries him then begins to suspect hes a murderer 
and that shes his next victim 
hitchcock masterfully kept audiences off balance one minute 
suggesting that charming johnnie aysgarth was indeed a killer the 
next revealing him as nothing more than an irresponsible 
spendthrift his crimes a figment of his wifes imagination 
whether they were or not was the bone of contention between hitch 
and the studio 
its hard to evaluate curtins and andrews performances since 
they speak the same lines as grant and fontaine 
for instance when johnnie crashes a party causing his 
unwilling host to sputter i dont know what to say he 
responds coolly i suggest you say something old boy before you 
embarrass this man indicating a butler to death no matter how 
good andrews is its cary grants line 
curtins lina never seems to connect convincingly with johnnie 
fontaine won an oscar for the role in which she alternately feared 
and adored her handsome husband 
curtins husband patrick lynch coproduced the movie with 
barry levinson a british filmmaker not the american director of 
tin men andrew grieve another briton directed by taking no 
chances 
levinson and screenwriter jonathan lynn the internecine 
project adapted the 1941 script by samuel raphaelson joan 
harrison and alma reville but almost nothing is changed from the 
hitchcock version save minor details such as sarah a secretary 
in lieu of emily the maid 
even lynns performance as beaky johnnies goodtime friend 
seems an impersonation of nigel bruce in the original 
the movie was based on a novel before the fact written by 
anthony berkeley cox under the pseudonym francis iles in the 
novel the husband really is a murderer and his wife after 
learning she is pregnant willingly drinks the poisoned milk he 
serves her to keep him from procreating 
according to hitchcock biographer donald spoto rko pictures 
refused to let the intended star at the time laurence olivier 
play a killer hitchcock offered to produce a script as a study of 
paranoid fantasy after delays grant and fontaine eventually were 
cast in the lead roles 
as the shooting dragged on hitchcock became ill at one point 
many endings were written and more than one was filmed 
when studio censors objected to pregnant fontaine willingly 
taking poison hitchcock added scenes suggesting shed had an 
illicit affair since it was ok for a character to commit suicide 
if the character had sinned but a preview audience laughed at the 
scenes according to spoto in another unused ending johnnie 
redeemed himself by joining the royal air force 
for the original suspicion climax hitchcock filmed grant 
and fontaine struggling in a speeding car by putting them on a 
soundstage with a moving backdrop grieve was able to shoot the 
scene using a real car on a real road on location in cornwall 
england such technical updating turns out to add nothing when 
compared to the original 
one bow to the 80s before the harrowing car ride curtin notes 
her seatbelt is broken a problem fontaine didnt mention in 1941

theres a wise old saying that when interest 
rates show signs of rising its a good time to consider moving 
your investments from stocks to bonds 
it may be one of those times now 
believing in the theory is one thing but believing in it 
strongly enough to make a basic investment change is a matter of a 
vastly different magnitude since commissions and steep capital 
gains taxes could be involved 
still since the theory seems to make sense the temptation is 
there 
when interest rates rise the returns from bonds become 
relatively more attractive as investors shift the prices of 
stocks tend to become depressed and as rates rise corporate 
earnings may fall depressing stocks further 
gerald perritt a former depaul university professor and current 
president and editor of the newsletter investment horizons is 
among those who wondered if reality performed according to theory 
and so he put the theory to the test 
using changes in the prime interest rate as a guide it was an 
arbitrary decision others measures could have been used he 
traced the stock markets reactions from march 25 1970 
for experimental purposes he assumed that on that date a 100 
percent commitment was made to the standard amp poors 500stock 
index and maintained until may 11 1971 when the prime rate rose 
to 55 percent from 525 percent 
the commitment was then sold and no stock investments were made 
until october 20 1971 when the prime rate fell to 575 percent 
from 6 percent 
thereafter he sold when the prime rose and bought when it fell 
the result a 462 percent gain in value dividends excluded 
which is more than double the 196 percent capital appreciation 
earned on a buyandhold strategy employed over the entire period 
he concludes even if commissions and income taxes are 
accounted for the prime rate portfolio readjustment strategy 
yields a significantly higher overall rate of return relative to 
implementation of a buyandhold strategy 
but the story doesnt end there in fact a very big question 
arises what might have happened if you werent able to hold the 
portfolio intact for that long period of time what if you had 
needed to cash in 
answer you might not have done very well since the strategy 
would not have yielded the best results on all occasions 
in fact says perritt there were five periods when the strategy 
would have placed the investor in the stock market during times of 
declining stock prices 
similarly on six occasions the strategy would have resulted in 
the investor sitting on the sidelines during periods of rising 
stock prices 
question would you or most other investors have been able to 
follow a strategy that failed to work on so many occasions 
confident that over longer periods of time it would work out for 
the best 
perritt concedes it would have taken extreme patience for 
investors to have followed the theory one of the reasons being it 
would have kept them on the sidelines for periods as long as 25 
months 
and he acknowledges the one investment axiom that has long 
stood the test of time is whatever has worked well in the past 
will most likely not work continuously in the future 
nevertheless he expresses the opinion that history often 
contains lessons which if learned and practiced can improve ones 
wellbeing 
this he believes is the case with the historical relationship 
between interest rates and stock market prices

often called the most typical of american 
denominations united methodism detects a blurring of its identity 
and is seeking to define it more clearly 
thats an objective of the churchs governing general 
conference which starts next tuesday in st louis and has before 
it proposed new summations of doctrine and mission 
the 10000word doctrinal paper has stirred controversy 
suggesting that theology the heart of belief is going to be a 
volatile topic of the 11day meeting 
other issues such has challenges to the 91millionmember 
denominations stand against homosexual practice and against 
ordaining active homosexuals have gained the most attention 
but the proposed doctrinal exposition deals with the rudimentary 
expression of the churchs character 
at issue is the documents backing away from previous strong 
affirmations of diversity or pluralism in concepts and 
approaches a variety that some see as reflecting vagueness 
the new doctrinal paper seeks to move away from glorification 
of pluralismsays the rev richard heitzenrater of dallas vice 
chairman of the commission that prepared the document 
but some contend it is too restrictive 
we believe that the proposed substitute to our current 
statement would move our church into a narrow sectarian and 
repressive stance says a group of about l00 clergy 
others however maintain the tightening up is needed to counter 
a tendency toward ambiguity about belief 
in any case writes the rev richard neuhause of new york a 
lutheran a tradition strong on theology 
whatever happens it is certain that within united methodism 
today there is a seriousness about theology and church doctrine 
that did not exist a couple of years ago 
that in itself is a most promising sign 
generally considered the most representative of american 
denominations methodism took root at the countrys origins and 
moved west with the population with methodist circuitriders 
common on the american froniter 
the church is spread through all sections of the country both 
rural and urban mostly middle class it has only about 4 percent 
ethnic minority members although it lately has emphasized ministry 
to them 
the denomination initially arose in england under john wesleys 
leadership with a special mission to serve the working classes 
and socially neglected wesleys spiritfilled verve not doctrinal 
exactitude marked the movemenmt 
methodism retains much of its socially activist urge but the 
scene now has changed become more complex in a multicultural 
nation and some say the churchs vision and direction have clouded 
two scholars of methodistrelated duke university divinity 
school maintain that the denomination the nations second largest 
protestant body next to southern baptists is no longer just one 
church but seven of them 
in a 1985 study the seven churches of methodism professors 
robert l wilson and william h willimon say regionalism 
characterizes the denomination rather than any overall cohesion 
regional differences are a fact of life and unless church 
leaders recognize and deal with those tensions any attempts to 
have homogeneous ministries will be imposssible says 
sociologistresearcher wilson 
he and willimon say the denomination now consists of these seven 
churches 
the new england yankee church declining and absorbed in 
ecclesiastical tinkering the industrial northeast church once 
strong but retreating to small towns the midwest church 
still a stable stronghold the church south conservative and 
cohesive the southwest church lively and fastest growing the 
frontier church still with a frontier spirit and the western 
church something of an enigmatic mixture 
the denomination second largest in the nation next to southern 
baptists and roman catholics emphasizes its variety in its present 
doctrinal statement adopted in 1972 saying 
the theological spectrum ranges over all the current 
mainstream options and a variety of specialinterest theologies 
and the church sees positive virtues of doctrinal pluralism even 
within the same community of believers 
the viability of all doctrinal opinion demands that the 
processes of theological development must be kept openended 
in the proposed new doctrinal statement developed in four years 
of work by a 22member committee puts the emphasis on scripture as 
the primary source and criterion for authentic christian truth 
and witness 
the other three guides that wesley put alongside scripture 
tradition experience and reason are described as aiding in 
grasping the meaning of scripture subordinate to it 
united methodists as a diverse people continue to strive for 
consensus in understanding the gospel the document says our 
task is to articulate our vision in a way that will draw us 
together as a people in mission 
in the name of jesus christ we are called to work within our 
diversity while exercising patience and forebearance with one 
another

after the united methodist publishing house 
cancelled plans to publish a book by a bishop advocating relaxed 
sexual views it was snapped up by a major commercial publisher 
harper amp row 
the author episcopal bishop john shelby spong of newark nj 
voiced delight at the outcome 
he said the methodist publisher abingdon press had 
commissioned the book but was so intimidated by reactionary 
critics that it backed out of the project only a month before 
publication 
however harper amp row said it would keep that schedule issuing

what happens when one of the biggest grossing 
movies of the season hits the home video market the happy studio 
that owns it makes sure there are enough copies available for sale 
and rental and launches a 1 million advertising campaign 
as if beverly hills cop ii would need much promotion 
the movie starring eddie murphy in a reprise of his role as a 
hip and irreverent detroit cop let loose in ever so chic and snotty 
beverly hills has raked in more than 153 million for paramount 
pictures since its release in may 1987 
according to eric doctorow senior vice president and general 
manager of paramount home video distributors retailers and mail 
order firms had already ordered over 500000 videocassettes of the 
movie by march

beverly hills cop ii vhs 8995 beta 2995 rated r 
 
eddie murphy is back as axel foley tooling around undercover in 
a red ferrari as detroits answer to sonny crockett until the 
shooting of his buddy police capt andrew bogomil carries him back 
to beverly hills 
there he teams up with rosewood judge reinhold and taggart 
john ashton to chase down a pack of gun smugglers triggering a 
nonstop round of shootouts broken glass squad car smashups and 
exploding trucks 
anyone who has the sneaking feeling theyve seen all this before 
is right director tony scott top gun took the formula that 
proved so successful the first time around and slapped it on film 
again chocking up 1987s biggest boxoffice winner in the process 
unfortunately this version has more of everything except the 
thing it needs most eddie murphy being funny 
the writers toss in some scraps of character development 
telling us that bogomil has a daughter taggart has a divorcehappy 
wife and rosewood has a gun fetish this goround also has rambos 
former squeeze brigitte nielsen nostrils flared destroying 
massive amounts of property without so much as smudging her makeup 
and it includes a gratuitous stop at the playboy mansion where hef 
himself gets to say a few words such as they are 
theres an rrating and lots of profanity theres more noise 
but less really graphic violence than the original adolescent boys 
probably would like it a lot 
diehard murphy fans will want to catch his occasional funny 
moments for others the laughs might prove too few and far between 
to make this worth tolerating

less than zero cbsfox vhsbeta stereo and available 
closed captioned for the hearing impaired 8998 rated r 
 
naming this movie less than zero was a forfeit to critics 
who among them could resist giving this dumb sentimental hollywood 
version of bret easton ellis novel less than zero the release of 
the video provides another chance to give it one last kick in the 
rump 
the movie stars andrew mccarthy an attractive young guy whose 
acting skills are unfortunately limited to a smirking and b 
gawking he plays clay easton a reasonably grounded college 
student who has come home for the holidays to find that his budding 
bimbo girlfriend jami gertz has been consorting with an old 
school chum robert downey jr who is busy flushing himself down 
the tubes because of drugs 
ellis book of the same title it has little else in common 
with the movie was a declaration of insignificance a scary 
ramble through the lives of visionless overprivileged untended 
youth the books pointlessness was its point the movie is 
immediately hobbled by a contrived good vs evil plot even the 
soundtrack is vapid with such tunes as the bangles remake of 
hazy shade of winter 
marek kanievkska another country directed the best thing 
about the movie except for unintentional laughs is the 
attractive photography of the highstyle minimalist southern 
california architecture unfortunately nobody is home

blow up your video atlantic acdc 
 
it may surprise those who lived through it but the 1970s are 
now regarded as a golden age for heavy metal rock a glance at 
magazine covers attests to led zeppelins continued deification 
aerosmith has returned to the charts and even ted nugent has a new 
record in the stores 
australian hard rockers acdc hope their new blow up your 
video album can return them to a place of prominence 
it just might years on the road have taught this band that 
sparkling originality is much less a prerequisite for heavy metal 
success than a loud noise that packs a wallop 
angus young may be looking more ridiculous every year in his 
english schoolboys outfit but it probably reassures the kids that 
he knows what they like acdc delivers songs of alienation and 
macho posturing with muscle 
blow up your video has a series of solid riffs even though 
some sound a little too familiar with thats the way i wanna 
rock n roll acdc joins a long list of led zeppelin immitators 
heatseeker is the kind of goodtime rocker that could become 
an anthem for teenaged boys out looking for girls or trouble or 
both this means war with a rhythm that shifts into overdrive 
is a headbangers delight 
the remainder of the songs falls into that great mass of metal 
that all tends to sound the same after awhile at least acdc has 
the sense to avoid turgid ballads brian johnsons voice never gets 
lower than a howl or occasional growl 
highway to hell and back in black have always been 
considered acdcs peaks blow up your video wont cause any 
reassessments but the band isnt ready for a rest home of 1970s

veteran actress olivia de havilland believes 
that preparation is the key to success in everything it partly 
explains why she kept a cool head during the preacademy award 
gridlock while others around her were losing theirs 
the scene around the shrine auditorium on the afternoon of april 
11 was one of panic bumpertobumper limos in all directions 
nominees meryl streep and glenn close nine months pregnant 
abandoned their limos to tramp down the city streets in their 
evening gowns 
so did olivia de havilland but unlike scores of others in the 
same plight she exhibited her customary melanielike calm 
one limousine after another disgorged its passengers she 
recalled with a lilting laugh there was a whole parade of people 
in black tie and evening dress striding along and i wish you could 
have seen the bemused households along the way they stood there 
not believing what they were looking at this marvelous procession 
out came a few discreet cameras snapping the spectacle 
one sight i thought very droll these stretch limousines look 
very invincible the white ones especially but there was one of 
them in the most undignified position with its nose up in the air 
resting on a tow truck 
miss de havilland arrived at the shrine on time she was the 
third presenter and recipient of a standing ovation the reason for 
her calm she said was preparation 
i went down to the shrine twice on friday and for the 
runthrough on saturday she said i wanted to be sure where 
everything was there were numerous details you needed to know for 
things to go smoothly thank heaven i did 
walking the eight blocks my dress had to be held and the 
sensitive material crumpled i knew exactly where the wardrobe was 
i needed powdering and i knew where the makeup was i also knew 
the number of my table at the board of governors ball and i 
think we were the first to be seated 
what was her reaction to best actress chers revealing 
appearance 
oh i think shes such a rascal miss de havilland said 
amusedly she has the most beautiful figure in the world and a 
marvelous face i must say i thought she was wearing black velvet 
then i realized she was just wearing lace and nothing else i let 
out a gasp and then i thought oh isnt she funny she put that 
on just to make people do that 
the shrine auditorium held special significance for miss de 
havilland fortytwo years ago on the same stage she won her first 
academy award as best actress for to each his own three years 
later she collected her second oscar for the heiress 
the name olivia de havilland evokes a flood of memories for 
anyone familiar with films she would be an icon if she had made 
only one movie the eternal gone with the wind however she is 
famed for much more from a midsummers night dream to hush 
hush sweet charlotte 
she has been a star since 1934 when she arrived in hollywood as 
a 17yearold from northern california she and her sister actress 
joan fontaine were born in tokyo she costarred seven times with 
errol flynn romanced with howard hughes and john huston feuded 
with her sister married novelist marcus goodrich who was 18 years 
her senior the marriage resulted in son benjamin and divorce 
daughter gisele was born from the marriage to french magazine 
editor pierre galante they were divorced in 1979 
while she reveres her hollywood past thats not where she 
lives strikingly beautiful at 71 she is very much a woman of 
today her home remains an elegant townhouse near the bois de 
bologne in paris but she travels to locations for such tv movies 
as anastasia and this months the woman he loved 
the actress is now becoming acquainted with the world of rock 
music since her daughter became engaged to french pop idol johnny 
halliday 
he is a national institution miss de havilland marveled 
about the singer who is 13 years older than gisele 
i saw him and gisele just before i left and i said youll 
have to excuse me but i have to start being very informed i 
asked from his point of view the most inane question what is 
the difference between a mandolin and a guitar he was very polite 
about it 
the thought of melanie wilkes attending a rock concert may seem 
bizarre but it happened while she was filming the woman he 
loved in villefranche the producer arranged a threehour drive 
so she could attend a halliday concert in marseilles she sat with 
giselle up front next to the sound and light controls 
gisele was very anxious to see how her mother would react to a 
rock concert the actress said i had never attended one very 
soon after the music began its such an impelling rhythm that i 
found myself going knees bobbing and my feet started to tap away 
i could not keep still 
after the concert halliday gisele and miss de havilland were 
taken by motorcycleescorted limousine to a quiet bistro 
that was the night he asked me for giseles hand the 
actress said i was startled because it was only the second time 
i had met him i said w w well yes

italians have launched into a widescale 
introspection of their past with the largest exhibit ever assembled 
on the phoenicians the ancient traders who colonized the 
mediterranean and created the basis of the modern alphabet 
new books public debates magazines articles tv documentaries 
tshirts imitation jewelry and greeting cards help celebrate a 
65 million exhibit which has attracted record crowds and started 
to correct some of the fallacies spread against the phoenicians 
because history is always written by the conquerors and never 
by those vanquished the phoenicians went down as the bad guys the 
most hated people in the ancient times said sabatineo moscati 
the archaeologist who assembled the exhibit at venices 18th 
century palazzo grassi 
for centuries they were believed to be infantkillers sharp 
and dishonest traders pirates and kidnappers he said the 
commercial and military power of carthage phoenician for the new 
town turned them into the rivals of the romans who systematically 
destroyed them in 146 bc after trouncing hannibal and his 
elephants 
moscatis exhibit brings together archeological discoveries 
unearthed since 1960 in the first attempt at a definitive public 
study of the phoenicians and their world it stretched from lebanon 
to spain and included forays as far as england and even around the 
tip of africa 
model galleys float their way across a large indoor pool while 
a huge plaster wave looms in the background at the entrance 
tablets graves and sarcophagi poke out of large sand dunes with 
their lids open as if to invite visitors to raise a civilization 
from the dead 
one room displays piles of almonds nuts spices flower petals 
and dyes emulating a phoenician market place and on the walls 
overlooking more than 1200 objects on display from museums and 
collections in 11 countries there are painted quotations from 
ancient sources including the old testament and recent authors 
the phoenicians emerged as a historically recognizable society 
around 1200 bc in what is now lebanon their history encompasses 
the prechristian millenium from the old testaments canaan to the 
punic wars between rome and carthage 
the phoenicians are generally credited with the invention of the 
alphabet changing symbols to phonetic signs alph originally 
in the shape of an oxs head meant ox while beth was a 
schematic square floor plan and meant house phoenician letters 
that turned into presentday usage included m a wavy line 
representing water n a slithering snake and h a man 
with his arms raised in jubilation 
phoenician cities spread over the mediterranean from tyre and 
sidon to carthage sardinia sicily spain and portugal they were 
the only people capable of making a highly prized purple dye called 
phoinix which gave them their name from a murex shell which 
was reserved only to byzantine emperors and their families 
according to the ancient historian herodotus phoenician 
navigators are believed to have sailed around africa over 2000 
years before the portuguese explorers because they reported the 
midday sun stood in the north instead of the south 
the phoenicians were the real inventors of private enterprise 
foreign trade and doortodoor sales economist mario 
salvatorelli said they would drop off their salesmen in various 
ports let them fan out toward the interior and pick them up on the 
way back with what they had bartered they also acted as the 
wholesale movers for other parties and created the ancestor of 
todays container enormous pitchers in which they moved dyes and 
other liquids 
phoenician craftsmen sent by king hyram of tyre were said to 
have built solomons temple in jerusalem 
while modern discoveries showed that egyptians and not 
phoenicians had discovered glass the traders developed an entire 
industry based on glass incense burners perfume bottles and 
delicate blue and white necklaces and bracelets grace the exhibit 
cases 
the talents of the phoenicians are much closer to what 
italians are like today than is commonly believed salvatorelli 
said 
although saint augustine reported that punic books contained 
many wise things the only existing phoenician writing today is 
a treatise on agriculture translated into latin and since they 
left so few records of themselves the little that is known about 
them recently was written by other nations 
one of the mysteries moscati claims to have solved regards 
charges by ancient writers that phoenicians threw newborn babies 
into the flames as a sacrifice to the gods however new finds and 
scientific analysis show that the babies sanctuaries were 
places for sacred cremation of already dead babies or fetuses 
there still remains much of the phoenician world to 
discover moscati said countries like algeria and morocco have 
not really been explored and in lebanon everything is at a 
standstill 
but in the meantime the biggest surprise for the italians has 
been to discover how widespread the phoenician colonization was on 
their territory besides most of their emporia on the continental 
coast onethird of sicily and all of sardinia was in their hands 
the exhibit closes nov 6

david byrne was in a hotel bathtub in 
minneapolis when he wrote lyrics for no more flowers for the 
talking heads 
this is just one bare fact the group revealed when talking about 
themselves in an interview to promote their latest lp naked 
byrne the groups lead singer and lyricist was in minneapolis 
to visit his wife costume designer adele lutz who was doing a 
play there 
i would work with this microcassette recorder he said i 
would have it sitting just outside the tub i would reach out and 
speak into it id be singing in the tub id catch a phrase that i 
thought was apropos id put it on the little recorder 
the album is on their new label fly records it jumped onto 
cashbox magazines bestselling album chart at no 20 on april 2 
this record actually goes back to our earliest songs and 
albums remain in light 1980 and speaking in tongues 1983 
where we would each contribute ideas said drummer chris frantz 
we rented a rehearsal studio in new york and each threw out 
ideas we had a little cassette recorder and had all our 
instruments there wed take an idea play it and play it trading 
instruments until it fell apart then wed strike up a new idea 
we ended up after 10 days with many snippets of songs 
we went to paris into a recording studio and commenced to put 
them all together into song form 
they went to paris for several reasons they laid down tracks 
with parisbased thirdworld musicians who play caribbean zuok and 
algerianmoroccan rai frantz said they also wanted to hang out 
together which theyre more apt to do in paris than in new york 
where they have different sets of friends 
my feeling is that lately there has been less openness here 
said byrne the groups lead singer and lyricist i wanted to get 
away from that feeling there is that kind of vibe here that 
whatever is top 10 in the united states is all there is there is a 
lot going on in other places 
byrne frantz and tina weymouth met at the rhode island school 
of design and still design their striking album packages they 
added jerry harrison to the trio and put out their first album in 
1977 
wally badarou who played keyboards on speaking in tongues 
found the paris studio and brought in other musicians 
one guitarist had a big smile the entire time he was playing 
with us weymouth said when youre putting down music with 
that kind of heartfelt feeling you know its coming across in the 
record 
harrison said the album has two moods this organic larger 
band is primarily on the first side of the album he said what 
weymouth terms the more experimental or ominous songs are on 
side 2 
after 15 basic tracks were recorded byrne improvised melodies 
and then wrote the words 
i heard a story about a french screenwriter who when it was 
time to write a script would rent a hotel room at the rafael and 
lock himself in the bathroom byrne said his secretary would 
deliver food he didnt allow himself to go out of there until it 
was all done he could barely afford to stay there he had to work 
every day 
i tried lyrics for all 15 on some the words and melodies 
werent quite right it was nice that we had enough there was one 
about marijuana its a great song too bad it was lagging behind 
in the race for the record so it didnt make it 
byrne who is british married the american lutz last july in 
paris harrison has a son who is 1 years old and weymouth and 
frantz who are married have two sons who are 5 and 2 
since they all have individual commitments to pursue the next 
talking heads project probably will be another album instead of a 
tour 
i put together storytelling giant a compilation of all the 
band videos and shot some extra material to go between them to 
kind of link them 
i hope to direct another movie with robert wilson in the 
summer in europe thats still in the planning stage we did 
something a couple of years ago the knee plays i think thats 
going into a theater in chicago 
byrnes last film was true stories a musical romp about an 
average texas town 
byrne also composed music for some scenes in bernardo 
bertoluccis the last emperor which won nine acaemy awards 
harrison who produced the bodeans inside looking out is 
putting together a band to tour behind the album he just released 
on sire records casual gods 
i did casual gods in wisconsin in a basement studio he 
said my mother was ill and my father had passed away i went 
back to milwaukee to take care of her whenever i could be there i 
found a basement studio i could rent by the week rather than by the 
hour owned by the younger brother of someone i had grown up with 
musicians would pass through town or i used local musicians i 
was paying for it myself when i was offered a production job i 
would always do it that caused my record to extend over the years 
i think it made it much better the songs are more diverse and i 
think my singing got better 
weymouth said she and frantz just finished conscious party 
by ziggy marley and the melody makers it is their only production 
outside of the tom tom club 
we are going into the studio to finish up our third tom tom 
club record frantz said after its released in june i think 
well tour in europe were in demand in europe 
ziggy marley whos 19 writes all the material his brother 
steve 15 sings one song cedella is 20 rita and sharon whos a 
mother of two sing backgrounds the melody makers formed by the 
late reggae king bob marley have been around since ziggy was 8 
its hard for me to imagine doing all this when i was 19

the physical torture is over for haing s ngor 
former doctor cambodian refugee movie actor and now author and 
activist 
but the nightmares wont stop and he cant forgive himself for 
being the only member of his immediate family to survive four 
hellish years under the khmer rouge the cambodian communists who 
seized power in 1975 
yes i have survivors guilt he says sitting in a luxury 
suite at a plush chicago hotel 
and every night i still have nightmares and i will never be 
forgiven by my memory for watching my wife die watching my parents 
tortured by the khmer rouge beaten by the khmer rouge killed by 
the khmer rouge 
ngor 40 won an academy award in 1985 for his first acting role 
when he portrayed cambodian journalist dith pran in the killing 
fields his own tale of survival under the brutal khmer rouge 
regime is told in haing ngor a cambodian odyssey macmillan 
publishing co 1995 which ngor wrote with journalist roger 
warner 
the book is an understated account of life in a country savaged 
first by civil war then by khmer rouge occupation ngor writes of 
scrounging for edible insects to stay alive he writes of watching 
his wife die in childbirth because helping her would reveal he was 
a doctor and mean his own certain death and he writes of torture 
his own and others 
no embellishment could add to the horror that comes through in 
this straight accounting 
they tied my upper arms to the cross and then my thighs and my 
feet ngor writes about one of the three times he was imprisoned 
and tortured then they threw the rope attached to the top of the 
cross over the goalpost and hoisted me up until my feet were above 
the pile of wood and rice hulls i swayed there back and forth 
after the guards tied all of the prisoners they went around to 
each pile of rice hulls and lit it with cigarette lighters 
rice hulls have a consistency like sawdust fires with rice 
hulls give off thick stinging smoke and burn slowly for days 
the war in vietnam spilled over into cambodia but the countrys 
own civil war racked what had been for centuries a sleepy agrarian 
culture where government corruption was accepted 
for many cambodians of mixed ancestry the native darkskinned 
khmers of the countryside seemed to pose no danger but in 1975 
the khmer rouge won control of cambodia renaming it democratic 
kampuchea americans were airlifted out of the country and many 
welloff cambodians such as ngor with his medical degree 
mercedesbenz and merchant family background left too 
but he stayed 
i couldnt believe that the khmer rouge would do what they 
did ngor said i couldnt believe that the khmer rouge would 
be so brutal so cruel and not only me the other educated people 
thought the same way 
as part of their purge the khmer rouge relocated the 
population emptying the cities and forcing residents into the 
countryside there are estimates 2 million to 3 million cambodians 
died under the khmer rouge 
on the day the capital phnom penh fell to the khmer rouge 
ngor was operating on a wounded government soldier he left the 
patient to die beginning his own struggle for survival 
ngors four years of hell didnt end until vietnam invaded 
cambodia and ngor had made his way to thailand and then to the 
united states and his new home in los angeles 
a cambodian odyssey began taking shape in a thai refugee 
camp ngor says it took two years to write 
the book is a memorial to my wife my family and the 
people that were killed by the khmer rouge ngor says but both 
the book and the movie were a catharsis as well 
ngor says hes seen the killing fields only once i didnt 
want to watch because it seemed like it would bring back all my 
memories he says 
why i decided to do it because before i crossed the border i 
go to my wifes grave and say sweet one day i will tell our 
story to the world 
secondly i know that film is very touching but i have to 
tell the world and i have not only the movie but i write 
that book 
ngor still lives in california and he says hes devoting some of 
his book and movie earnings to building hospitals for refugees 
along the thailands border with cambodia which remains under 
vietnamese occupation 
a buddhist ngor filters his experience through his belief in 
karma the cycle of birth suffering and rebirth 
maybe in my last life before this one i did something wrong 
to hurt people he says but this life i paid back please 
next life do not separate my family and my wife 
i want to have my whole family and i dont want to see that 
kind of torture

the white knight that irving bank corp 
sought for help in its bitter battle against hostile suitor bank of 
new york co turned out to be italys secondlargest bank 
irving said monday that staterun banca commerciale italiana has 
agreed to acquire a 51 percent stake in irving for 65 a share in 
cash or 6175 million countering bank of new yorks overtures 
irving also announced a complex restructuring plan that includes 
the sale of its 50story wall street headquarters a costcutting 
program and a boost in its annual stock dividends 
the company put the total value of the cash offer and 
restructuring at between 11 billion to 12 billion 
irving spokesman d emerson phelps said the deal would allow 
irving management to retain control of the company although the 
board of directors would be expanded to include four banca 
commerciale representatives 
in addition to the banca commerciale tender offer which begins 
today irving shareholders will get a special dividend of 10 a 
share upon completion of the deal irving said 
the company said stockholders could receive cash for about half 
of their shares and retain the other half 
our shareholders will benefit far more from the affiliation 
with bci than the proposal advanced from bny bank of new york 
irving chairman joseph a rice stated irving anticipates 
increases in its revenues as a result of its ongoing relationship 
with bci 
irvings announcement comes just days after bank of new york 
shareholders voted to support managements 1 billionplus hostile 
offer for irving bank of new york last month began a tender offer 
of 15 in cash and 1575 of its common shares for each of irvings 
roughly 181 common shares outstanding 
bank of new york which holds a 49 percent stake in irving 
also is running a slate of 16 nominees to irvings board of 
directors irvings annual meeting is scheduled for thursday 
although most business will be conducted at a reconvened meeting on 
saturday to give shareholders time to digest the bci offer irving 
said 
irving over the past seven months repeatedly has spurned bank of 
new yorks takeover proposals maintaining it wanted to remain 
independent but recently disclosing it was seeking a white 
knight friendly merger partner as an alternative 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said his company would to 
study the banca commerciale offer but it felt its own bid was 
superior 
brady also said the foreign offer for irving could run into 
problems gaining regulatory approval from the state of new york and 
the federal reserve contending banca commerciale might have 
problems meeting capital adequacy requirements 
michael starr a banking analyst with duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago said bank of new york could sweeten its current offer but 
it would have to resubmit to the lengthy regulatory process that 
includes hearings before the federal reserve and new york state 
banking boards 
analysts said they werent surprised irving sought help from a 
foreign bank because many large us banks lack the capital for 
big acquisitions but some experts said they found the complexity 
of the deal may have accounted for the relatively lackluster 
activity in irving stock 
irving shares rose slightly on the new york stock exchange on 
monday before declining to close 1 lower at 6037 bank of new 
york shares gained 1 to 3165 
as part of its restructuring irving said it would enact a hiring 
freeze as part of an intensive cost saving program the program 
could raise net income to about 160 a share in 1988 and 275 
next year 
in addition the company said said it immediately would increase 
its annual common dividend from 242 a share to 450 
to pay for the special 10ashare dividend irving said it 
planned to sell its wall street headquarters and its 39 percent 
equity interest in banca della svizzera italiana for more than the 
current market price of about 325 million 
banca commerciale based in milan has assets of about 60 
billion and is italys second largest bank behind banca nazionale 
del lavoro about 64 percent of banca commerciale is owned by the 
giant state holding company istituto per la ricostruzione 
industriale irvings assets total 2412 billion 
irving lost 19327 million last year after raising its

robert e allen will have a chance on wednesday 
to convince atampts shareholders that the company remains on track 
in spite of the death from cancer of chairman james e olson 
olsons death on monday at age 62 came just two days before the 
companys annual shareholders meeting in denver it shocked the 
company coming just one month after the vigorous toughtalking 
executive was reported ill with flu 
allen 53 who will field questions at the annual meeting is 
the president and chief operating officer of american telephone amp 
telegraph coand is serving as acting chairman 
analysts say allen was being groomed to succeed olson as 
chairman although no one expected the transition to come so 
quickly he is the oddson favorite to be named chairman by the 
board of directors which might make a decision this week 
like olson allen rose in atampt through the local telephone 
operating companies that once belonged to the bell system he also 
is a career atampt executive but in contrast to the blunt 
gregarious olson allen is described as quiet and thoughtful 
though determined 
hes a very bright and very direct kind of guy and very 
lowkey if you lived in a nice neighborhood hed be one of the 
nicer neighbors said peter bernstein senior analyst at probe 
research inc in cedar knolls nj 
olson became atampt chairman in september 1986 when the company 
still was adrift after the 1984 breakup of the bell system he cut 
costs oversaw the painful cutting of 27000 jobs and gave the 
company a sense of direction 
olson was the one guy who was hardnosed enough that he would 
push and get his way and drive people who may not feel the same 
pressure under the new chairman said fulton holmes an analyst 
for thomson mckinnon securities 
in contrast to olson whose first job with atampt was cleaning 
silt out of manholes in north dakota in 1943 allen started out in 
management at indiana bell after his graduation from wabash college 
allen worked his way up through indiana bell bell of 
pennsylvania illinois bell and the chesapeake and potomac 
telephone cos he was slated to become a president in 
philadelphiabased bell atlantic at the time of the atampt breakup in 
1984 but instead was called to serve as executive vice president 
and chief financial officer of atampt in july 1983 
allen took charge of corporate administration and finance in 
1984 and was promoted to chairman and chief executive of atampt 
information systems in 1985 he was named president and chief 
operating officer in 1986 
in a sign of allens standing he shared the spotlight with 
olson in the introduction to the companys latest annual report 
which featured a questionandanswer session with the two 
executives 
here are some of the problems atampt will have to face with olson 
gone 
morale though somewhat improved still leaves room for 
improvement atampts own surveys have found 
the companys computer business continues losing money and may 
not become profitable until 1990 some analysts say the company 
needs to buy an established computer maker 
shareholders are agitating for an increase in the quarterly 
dividend which has been 120 a share since the breakup 
atampt still gets 91 percent of its revenue in the united states 
and is having a hard time cracking foreign markets a company goal 
since the early 1980s 
analysts differed on how significant olsons loss would be 
in a lot of ways allen is an unknown quantity my sense is he 
does not have the kind of following olson had but he has not been 
in a position where he could get those loyalties said daniel 
rosenbaum executive editor of wiretap newsletter in morristown 
nj 
what he olson forged together may start to slip apart a 
little bit said thomson mckinnons holmes 
but jack grubman an analyst for painewebber inc said allen is 
olsons handpicked successor and he said jim olson is not 
the type of guy to groom someone if he did not feel that person 
would carry forward his plans 
on the new york stock exchange atampt stock fell 25 cents to 
2637 on monday 
allen and his wife elizabeth have five children and live in 
short hills nj olsons hometown

armtek corp says it will be looking to 
acquire additional automotiverelated businesses once it completes 
the sale of its armstrong tire co to italys pirelli group 
armtek announced monday it had agreed to sell armstrong tire to 
pirelli one of europes largest tiremakers for 190 million cash 
armtek will use most if not all of the proceeds to reduce its 
longterm debt which stood at about 300 million the end of the 
first quarter said john n sievers director of corporate planning 
and investor relations 
armtek also will seek additional acquisitions to pursue its goal 
of becoming a leading worldwide supplier of materials components 
and systems to automotive and industrial markets company officials 
said 
we will not stray at all from our automotive focus sievers 
said 
armtek is the parent of dayco products inc a supplier of 
engineered drive systems including automotive and industrial belts 
and hoses blackstone corp a maker of heat exchange systems and 
components and copolymer rubber amp chemical corp a producer of 
specialty polymers 
sievers said growth prospects were good for all three companies 
armstrong tire founded 75 years ago employs about 2700 
people the company supplies the majority of all passenger and 
lighttruck radial tires sold by sears roebuck and co its largest 
customer for more than 50 years it is also a leading supplier of 
farm tires 
pirelli had sought last year to acquire 80 percent of armstrong 
tire but talks ended because the companies could not agree on the 
value of the proposed buyout armtek officials said 
this time armtek and pirelli signed an agreement for the sale 
of 100 percent of armstrong tire 
ludovico grandi president of pirellis worldwide tire 
operation said pirelli would benefit from armstrongs excellent 
aftermarket distribution and efficient production facilities 
the transaction is subject to approval by armteks board which 
meets today and wednesday and is expected to close by may 31 
pirelli societe generale sa of milan italy recently lost out 
to japans bridgestone corp in a bidding war for firestone tire amp 
rubber co 
pirelli will be acquiring three armstrong tire manufacturing 
plants in des moines iowa hanford calif and nashville tenn 
and its tire chord and fabric manufacturing facility in laurel 
hill nc 
armstrong is not selling its tube plant in little rock ark 
although pirelli has expressed interest in acquiring it later 
sievers said 
pirelli has agreed as part of the sale to purchase raw 
materials from copolymer rubber amp chemical on a longterm basis 
sievers said 
the sale of armstrong to pirelli follows a general trend of 
consolidation in the tire industry brought on by the widespread use 
of radial tires which do not need to be replaced frequently 
buffeted by both domestic and foreign competition armtek had 
been reducing its reliance on the tire business in recent years 
in 1980 90 percent of the revenue of armstrong rubber co now 
known as armtek came from the tire business by the end of the 
1987 fiscal year that segment accounted for only 38 percent of its 
12 billion in revenue 
about 300 people are employed as corporate staff for armstrong 
at armteks headquarters here sievers said the sale was not 
expected to change the management structure significantly

the number of enhanced oil recovery projects 
operating in the united states fell by 28 percent over the past two 
years due to the sliding price of crude oil according to an 
industry magazine 
the projects which are aimed at boosting oil recovery from 
known reservoirs suffered from crude prices that were too low to 
provide incentives for expansion and from a lack of capital to 
invest in new projects the oil and gas journal reported in its 
monday issue 
the journals report came as about 1000 industry 
representatives attended a threeday symposium on enhanced oil 
recovery methods beginning here on monday 
oil prices which remain in the 18abarrel range are forcing 
larger american producers away from highcost enhanced oil recovery 
methods and into areas with quicker payoffs said lowell r smith 
chairman of the tulsa symposium and head of research for amoco 
production companys tulsa facility 
a journal survey indicated 366 active eor projects in the united 
states compared with 512 projects at the same time two years ago 
over the same period production from enhanced recovery operations 
increased slightly to 637000 barrels of oil a day 
enhanced oil recovery techniques include the the injection of 
steam gases or liquids into oilproducing formations thermal 
recovery methods mostly steam injection account for about 73 
percent of the additional production resulting from eor operations 
the journal said 
some 960 million will be spent on enhanced recovery projects 
planned for 1988 and 1989 in the united states and elsewhere based 
on investment information for 76 projects during that period the 
magazine stated

first nh banks inc the states largest 
bank holding company has signed a definitive agreement to be 
acquired by bank of ireland for about 370 million 
the 3050 a share buyout proposal announced monday which is 
subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and banking 
regulators comes as new hampshire is about to relax its 
restrictions on interstate banking 
first nh stock rose 150 to 27 a share monday in national 
overthecounter trading 
raymond schwedhelm a spokesman for first nh banks said the 
bank would retain its name and current management under the bank of 
ireland proposal 
bank of ireland has assets of about 15 billion while nh banks 
has 25 billion in assets 
banking analysts said they considered first nh banks a prime 
takeover target following a revised banking bill expected to be 
signed into law this month by gov john sununu 
enactment of the banking bill is expected to spark an avalanche 
of negotiations for new hampshire banks which no outofstate bank 
seriously pursued under the interstate banking law passed last year 
the new hampshire economy is strong they have good tax laws 
and a low unemployment rate its a state that most bankers are 
envious about and want to get into said james moynihan a bank 
analyst at advest inc in boston 
under existing law regional banks merging with or acquiring a 
new hampshire bank must have all their deposits within new england 
they are prohibited from acquiring banks outside new england once 
they buy new hampshire institutions 
the pending revision means an acquiring bank need have only 51 
percent of its deposits in new england on the day it applies for 
state approval of a purchase the revised measure also loosens 
restrictions on doing business with banks outside of the region

federal aviation administrator allen mcartor 
said today he is delighted that there is a consensus that change 
is needed in the nations air safety system 
its not a matter of unsafe or safe or that something is 
wrong its just that improvement is necessary improvement is 
required mcartor said on nbctvs today show 
his comments came a day after a presidential commission said 
that the government should step up its inspection of the nations 
airlines if safety is to be maintained and should establish a 
permanent program of indepth examinations of air carriers 
the findings were released as the federal aviation 
administration continued its detailed inspection of two of the 
countrys largest airlines continental and eastern and a staged a 
broad review of safety among the countrys commuter airlines 
the presidential panel called on the faa to hire additional 
inspectors stage more frequent surprise inspections and give 
priority to airlines undergoing major changes 
these changes to the inspection program are critical to 
maintaining safety said john albertine chairman of the 
presidents commission on aviation safety 
albertine also appearing on today commented that the faa 
is falling behind in the area of technology because of federal 
regulations relating to procurement 
in addition the agency is hampered by civil service hiring 
rules albertine said he said he would hope a new independent 
agency could set its own more flexible hiring and procurement 
practices 
rep guy molinari rny during an appearance on abcs good 
morning america termed the idea of surprise inspections a good one 
the current safety system is basically sound moninari said 
there just arent enough air traffic controllers maintenance 
technicians and safety inspectors more of those people are needed 
he said 
last year the faa had just over 2000 inspectors an increase of 
about 500 over the last five years the commission said 
the panel released its report after a ninemonth study of 
airline safety and recommended 
the faa be separated from the transportation department under 
an independent authority funded through aviation taxes 
creation of a topranking official in the new faa who would 
assume the job of aviation safety czar and have broad 
regulatory powers 
safety requirements for commuter airlines be gradually 
tightened to put them on the same level as the major air carriers 
requiring small private planes flying near hub airports to 
have equipment that tells controllers altitude information the faa 
already has proposed regulations that would require such equipment 
on an even broader scale 
the commission concluded that while commercial aviation remains 
safe the government may lose its ability to keep the skies safe 
without major structural overhaul of the way the airline 
industry is regulated 
the nations air transportation system is safe for now 
said albertine however that safety is being maintained to an 
increasing extent through delays and through what i can only 
characterize as heroic efforts of air traffic controllers airways 
facilities technicians safety inspectors and other faa personnel 
the commission rejected suggestions by some industry groups that 
the faa be taken out of the government and be made a semiprivate 
agency it also said it was not in favor of spinning off air 
traffic control functions into a private function as has been 
suggested by transportation secretary james burnley 
the regulatory process must remain governmental in character 
and not be taken out of the federal government or removed from 
public accountability said albertine 
initial reaction to the report was favorable although both 
industry and congressional sources expressed skepticism that 
congress would go along with creation of an aviation safety 
czar 
sen wendell ford dky chairman of the senate commerce 
science and transportation subcommittee on aviation said the 
commissions proposal to remove the agency from the transportation 
department is a muchneeded change 
ford is sponsoring a bill that would make the faa an independent 
agency a proposal endorsed monday by several industry 
organizations 
gabriel phillips executive vice president of the air transport 
asociation which represents the nations airlines said 
reorganization of the faa is the only way to solve personnel 
purchasing and other problems 
john obrien a safety official of the air line pilots 
association and john thornton national coordinator for the 
national air traffic controllers association said the commissions 
findings are likely to give a boost to legislation calling for an 
independent faa within the government 
burnley the transportation secretary has not endorsed an 
independent faa although he favors turning air traffic control 
functions over to a private entity 
recently jim burnett chairman of the national transportation 
safety board expressed concern about the influence the airlines 
might have over an independent faa 
im concerned that the aviation industry is trying to get an 
independent faa because it is easier for them to dominate an 
independent faa said burnett 
the seven members of the commission created by congress were 
appointed last year by president reagan they concluded that the 
1978 deregulation of the airline industry has not eroded safety as 
some critics have contended 
while the number of airline passengers has grown from about 250 
million in 1978 to 450 million last year the numbers of accidents 
fatalities and injuries have all decreased the report said

shearson lehman hutton inc continues 
defending its controversial role in the hostile 17 billion 
takeover bid being waged for koppers co while koppers says its 
first quarter net loss stemmed partly from expenses in defending 
against the bid 
the group led by shearson and britains beazer plc on monday 
extended its stalled 60 a share tender offer through midnight edt 
friday 
the oneweek extension had been expected following a federal 
judges ruling last friday that indefinitely blocked the bid 
because of apparent securities law violations 
koppers stock fell 37 cents to 5325 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading on monday 
us district judge maurice b cohill jr who issued the 
injunction blocking the tender offer has said the takeover was the 
first known instance of an investment bank being the outright owner 
of a takeover vehicle 
he also has called shearson a major equity participant in 
the deal and said that although the firm had only limited voting 
rights in the company created to acquire koppers it was one of the 
entities on whose behalf the hostile bid was made 
peter a cohen chairman of shearson lehman brothers holdings 
inc parent of the investment bank told reporters on monday that 
the firms role in the takeover attempt was not unusual or out of 
line 
bns inc the company formed by shearson british industrialist 
brian c beazer and national westminster bank to acquire koppers 
shearson paid 23 million for a 46 percent interest in bns 
which compares with the 49 percent interest worth 245 million 
held by beazer chairman of the british construction and building 
materials company bearing his name 
cohen and other shearson executives said the firm doesnt hold 
real equity because it can force beazer to buy its share within 
five years and beazer can force shearson to sell through a call 
cohen said equity is something thats got a continuous life 
and ours doesnt 
for several years takeover lenders have been accepting warrants 
or the right to purchase stock at a specified price and 
warrantsthe last time i looked were characterized as an equity 
security cohen said 
shearson probably will make less than 30 million on its equity 
in bns he said declining to say what shearson stands to make in 
fees 
separately koppers said it spent at least 35 million in the 
first quarter to resist the hostile bid helping generate a 
quarterly net loss of 85 million the company posted a 3 million 
net loss in first quarter 1987 
at least half of the additional 7 million koppers incurred in 
firstquarter overhead was in fees for attorneys financial 
advisers and other defense costs said company spokesman robert j 
ogara 
ogara said he could not quantify the defense expenses beyond 
saying they were a majority of the 7 million the tender offer was 
launched march 3 twothirds of the way through the quarter 
koppers said its firstquarter sales climbed 13 percent from 
2717 million to 3067 million 
the companys construction materials and services businesses had 
operating losses totaling 23 million compared to losses of 41 
million a year earlier operating earnings in chemicals and related 
products climbed to 86 million from 64 million

dell computer corp has become the first 
company to announce it has developed personal computers based on 
international business machines corps patented personal system2 
design 
the dell system 400 and system 500 are expected to be available 
for sale in the final three months of 1988 and should cost about 30 
percent less than comparable ibm models michael dell the 
companys 23yearold founder and chief executive announced monday 
dell said it expects to complete a patent licensing agreement 
with ibm in the very near future 
ibm spokesman john mihalec said the company could not confirm 
talks with particular companies but reaffirmed that the company is 
willing to provide licenses on its patents under reasonable terms 
and conditions 
however mihalec said a patent license does not protect a 
company if it happens to infringe on features of the personal 
system2 and its micro channel architecture that are protected in 
other ways such as by copyrights 
ibms micro channel architecture has been touted by ibm as a way 
to improve the performance of personal computers when they are 
linked together in networks it also allows the machine to perform 
more than one major task at a time 
but industry analysts say the new personal system2 computers 
still lack the software and additional features to take full 
advantage of the new design they say machines with conventional 
designs offer higher performance for less cost 
dell reported sales of 159 million and earnings of 94 million 
for its last fiscal year ended jan 31 it has grown to the 
countrys seventh largest maker of personal computers since being 
founded in 1984 with a 1000 investment

attention shoppers its time for a quick 
quiz 
a customer goes into a large discount store hoping to save a 
bundle on running shoes he finds that the prices are indeed 
slashed but there are eight different kinds to choose from 
what should he do 
a buy the pair that looks the most sophisticated 
b try to find a sales clerk who may know slightly more than him 
about running shoes 
c leave the store confused 
d all of the above 
consumers across the country whether theyre shopping for shoes 
or kitchen appliances are coming up with all of those and other 
equally unfulfilling answers 
you almost have to know everything there is to know about a 
product before you go into a store said james tiernan executive 
director of the chicagobased american consumers association 
consumer frustration is one reason a tiny rochesterbased 
computer company has introduced a curious new machine into 
supermarkets around the country to help the confused the tired and 
the busy shopper 
interad a private firm sells computers that can be used to 
give directions in the store to print out recipes or coupons or to 
offer food preparation instruction all with a touch of a finger 
weve seen a trend away from the traditional homemaker to 
twocareer families and these are people who have less time to 
shop said michael mizesko interads director of marketing 
convenience has become more important than price now and these 
machines are part of that 
these machines and others like them may be the answer of the 
future for the baffled consumer according to two rochester 
institute of technology professors who are doing research in the 
consumer computer field 
having computers as sales people is something that has attracted 
the attention of many large companies said dan joseph and thomas 
williams 
the idea they say is to program computers to analyze various 
consumer decisions like what kind of motor oil do i need or 
how much will these denim jeans stretch and provide some 
guidance 
the professors say these socalled expert systems are going 
to be popping up in all kinds of stores over the next five years 
people are getting tired of hearing i dont know i just work 
here they dont want to be at the mercy of that kind of 
salesperson said joseph 
the two researchers are putting the finishing touches on a 
system to help people choose a personal computer they also have a 
program on the drawing board to offer advice on running shoes 
joseph said he hopes to set up his expert computer 
consultant in the school bookstore by the end of the summer and 
see how it fares eventually he would like to put it in computer 
stores around the country 
the idea of using computers to analyze problems and offer advice 
is not new but so far they have been used mostly in industrial or 
scientific applications 
the first system created in the early 70s was called mycin and 
it served the medical profession offering diagnoses of various 
bacterial blood infections joseph said the only problem was that 
it took a whole day to get one diagnosis 
since then however expert systems have been greatly improved 
and are used to diagnose problems in auto engines to predict where 
veins of valuable mineral deposits are and to offer advice to oil 
drillers 
the time has come to make the jump to the consumer said 
joseph 
interad has machines in several hundred stores in 75 different 
supermarket chains in 32 states and canada the store directory is 
the most popular model with a cuisine machine which offers videos 
of how to carve a turkey or clean a fish found in about half as 
many stores 
last year interad introduced the information station which 
combines the two machines and also prints coupons and can be used 
for instore advertising 
that system is being tested by the cincinnatibased kroger co 
which is using it in seven stores other chains are also using the 
system mizesko said 
the machines cost from 7000 to 12000 he said 
eventually the 6yearold interad company that president james 
odorczyk started in his home after resigning from xerox corp hopes 
to use its video kiosks to serve as a national instore advertising 
network 
tiernan the consumer advocate warned that the potential use of 
these expert systems as advertising vehicles is the biggest 
drawback they have although he estimated that overall they would 
be a service rather than a sales gimmick for shoppers 
but you still have to remember if the store manager says hes 
got an extra shipment of basil he needs to sell you might see a 
whole lot of recipes calling for fresh basil tiernan said

officials of first city bancorporation of texas 
announced today that the companys tender offer for debt holders to 
submit their securities was successful paving the way for a 16 
billion federal bailout plan 
last month the company which officially becomes the first 
city acquisition corp under the plan lowered the required 
participation level from 90 percent to 70 percent 
in making todays announcement however company officials 
declined to confirm that senior and subordinated debt holders had 
surrendered 70 percent of the bank holding companys debt 
first city officials announced last week they planned to 
complete the deal by today a monday afternoon deadline the 
companys sixth passed without word from first city on whether the 
company had completed the last obstacle to finish the 
reorganization plan 
as of last week 661 percent or 1493 million of the banks 
2258 million in bonds had been tendered first city needs at 
least 158 million of the outstanding debt tendered to complete the 
deal 
chicago investor a robert abbouds effort to rescue 
houstonbased first city with the help of 970 million from the 
federal deposit insurance corp has been slowed by bondholders 
reluctance to part with the debt 
first city senior debt holders have been offered 45 cents on the 
dollar for their debt while subordinated debt holders have been 
offered 35 cents 
bonds not tendered by the deadline become the obligation of the 
revitalized first city and would be worth more than what abboud is 
offering 
the bailout plan announced in september calls for 970 million 
in assistance from the fdic a spinoff of 179 billion in book 
value of poorly performing assets and 500 million infusion of 
capital raised privately by a group headed by abboud 
also on monday cnn business news reported that abboud has 
agreed to put up more than 500 million in private money through 
new stock underwritten by donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities 
corp the report said drexel burnham lambert inc has pledged 100 
million under certain conditions as part of that sum 
a first city spokesman said he was not aware of drexel burnham 
lamberts involvment with abboud calls to the new york investment 
company from the associated press were not returned 
first city with 59 banks in texas and one in south dakota grew 
quickly during the texas oil boom but was hit by energy and real 
estate losses when oil prices plummeted 
for 1987 the states fourthlargest bank holding company posted 
a 11 billion loss 
in a 10k report filed late last month with the securities and 
exchange commission first city reported it expected to lose 43 
million by the time the reorganization is completed 
if the first city doesnt redeem enough bonds the fdic says it 
will resort to an alternative that will hurt bondholders more than 
abbouds proposal 
the fdic wont say what the alternatives are but analysts 
suspect the agency would declare first city insolvent seize it 
under its emergency powers and then turn it over to abboud if that 
happens bondholders would get wiped out 
another alternative would be to declare first city bankrupt and 
negotiate with bondholders in court

oil futures prices dropped sharply today as 
profittaking continued in the wake of the runup that erupted on 
mondays explosion of usiran fighting in the persian gulf 
in midday trading on the new york mercantile exchange west 
texas intermediate the benchmark us crude stood at 1812 per 
42gallon barrel down 15 cents from mondays closing price 
may contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline were trading at 
5240 cents per gallon down 090 cent while wholesale heating oil 
contracts were down 085 cent at 4965 cents per gallon 
analysts said selling hit the market from the start continuing 
a trend that began early monday afternoon 
anticipating that diminished middle east oil supplies might send 
prices higher many traders rushed to buy monday despite widespread 
realization that any shortfall could easily be diminished by other 
world producers analysts said 
as a result when the initial excitement died down prices 
slipped back because of profittaking and technical factors they 
said 
us navy vessels destroyed two offshore iranian oil platforms 
sank a defending iranian patrol boat and bombed two iranian navy 
frigates in retaliation for a mine attack that nearly sank a us 
vessel iran attacked oil facilities off sharjah and fired on at 
least two us vessels 
jayne ball an analyst at the dean witter reynolds inc 
investment firm said prices soared on those reports even though 
theres an overall recognition that if you shut down the gulf 
theres not so big an impact on world oil supplies because of 
the number of other producers has grown 
but the markets still worry to the point that anything that 
happens in that area has got to have an impact on prices she 
added 
ms ball said the failure of the may crude contract to move 
above 19 discouraged traders who then began the afternoon selloff 
the may crude contract expires at wednesdays close and so a 
lot of people took advantage of the higher prices and sold off

jamie securities co will be dissolved due to 
legal problems of managing partner john mulheren arrested on 
charges he tried to kill insider trader ivan boesky sources close 
to the stock speculation firm said tuesday 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
jamie officials agreed they should disband it because of mulherens 
incapacitation 
fred stone jamies general counsel confirmed that jamie is 
in the process of dissolution but would not elaborate on why 
officials at the new york stock exchange and american stock 
exchange said tuesday that jamie resigned its membership from both 
exchanges april 7 
once one of wall streets most aggressive speculators in stocks 
of companies targeted for rumored and actual takeovers jamie had 
more than 300 million under management 
jamies activities have declined sharply since mulheren 
carrying a loaded rifle was seized by police feb 18 outside his 
rumson nj home and charged with threatening to kill boesky and 
boeskys former trader michael davidoff 
both men were said to have implicated mulheren in a wall street 
corruption scandal that centers around boesky formerly a

he is said to be under investigation by both the securities and 
exchange commission and a federal grand jury 
the government has submitted an affidavit to a federal 
magistrate in manhattan that says prosecutors and mulherens 
attorneys are talking about disposing of the case which has led to 
speculation that plea bargaining is taking place 
otto obermaier mulherens chief attorney said in response that 
the prosecution and defense in all cases talk about a variety of 
topics including possible resolution of their differences and also 
possible preparation for trial

at age 26 on his way to becoming a 
bestselling author harvey mackay bought a failing envelope 
company with 12 employees annual sales of 200000 and a few 
pieces of brokendown equipment 
he didnt change the companys name to mackay envelope corp for 
2 years he says because i didnt want the mackay name on it if 
i went bankrupt 
today that company has 350 employees sales of approximately 35 
million and modern plants in both minnesota and iowa and for the 
past 10 years mackay has traveled around the world giving seminars 
for other businesses 
now the 55yearold minneapolis businessman has written a book 
outlining his philosophy on how to become successful and the 
insights hes gleaned from his experiences 
swim with the sharks without being eaten alive was published 
march 23 by midapril 150000 copies had been sold the book was 
on back order and was no 2 on the new york times bestseller list 
in the howto category 
the books success was no accident 
i traveled around the country visiting bookstores and talking 
with people in the industry before starting to write the book two 
years ago mackay said 
his research showed many books fail because they arent 
available in the bookstores so when he went to william morrow amp 
co inc in new york to talk about a contract he asked for a first 
printing of 100000 copies 
im an unknown firsttime author from the flyover state of 
minnesota i wanted to make sure there were enough he remembers 
with the dry wit characteristic of the book 
but mackay also was prepared to show morrow officials how he 
could help them 
i told them i knew about 2000 presidents and chief executive 
officers of major companies throughout the united states and said i 
would mail the book to those people mackay said 
they had to know i had made a personal commitment to help them 
market the book he said mackay told them he was willing to take 
time off from his business for an extended book tour and said he 
would put on a twohour seminar for the companys sales force 
during the seminar i would not talk about my book he said 
but the presentation meant the sales force would know mackay and 
those same sales people would then be selling his book to the 
bookstores 
it was a twoway street good for them and a big break for 
me he said 
when the contract was written mackay had a 150000 budget for 
promotion a sixfigure advance he wont disclose the exact 
amount and a 100000 first printing 
after he began writing mackay was invited to bring his 
manuscript and address a publishing course at stanford university 
one of the professors made his first draft mandatory reading for 
the class mackay said giving him free feedback from the 85 
students 
once the manuscript was completed mackay sent copies to nearly 
50 wellknown friends asking them to read it and drop him a line 
telling him what they thought 
i was hoping for three or four responses mackay said 
fortyfive responded including former president gerald ford 
former vice president walter mondale newsman ted koppel feminist 
gloria steinem notre dame football coach lou holtz actors robert 
redford and eddie albert advice columnist abigail dear abby van 
buren new york gov mario cuomo baseball commissioner peter 
ueberroth and evangelist billy graham 
their praises of swim with the sharks are printed on the 
first 15 pages before the title page 
the book is about preparing to win preparing to be 
successful changing the probability leveling the playing field so 
you have the highest probability going for you to succeed mackay 
said there are all kinds of people who are really trying but are 
spinning their wheels 
however he stresses the difference between being successful and 
getting rich 
i believe a successful person is one who measures the standard 
of his or her own performance by their own potential said 
mackay the topranked tennis player in his age group in minnesota 
and a selfdescribed language junkie who speaks chinese 
japanese and arabic 
measuring your success by the standards of others doesnt 
work he quips because every time you catch up with the joneses 
they refinance 
the cornerstone of the book is a 66question customer profile 
which mackay developed for his own sales people to use to become 
a colleague of the people youre dealing with and to help make 
sales 
the profile includes detailed information on the persons 
education family and business background special interests and 
lifestyle 
but mackay stressed that sincerity is important in dealing with 
people you might fool someone in the short term but not in the 
long term he said 
the book now in its seventh printing was written primarily to 
help people but also as a legacy for his three grown children 
said mackay whose wife carol ann has been accompanying him on 
the book tour 
there is no greater reward in life than to be able to help 
another human being period thats what turns me on he said 
while mackay had the money and the connections to promote his 
book he says it isnt necessary to have money to make money 
you can take my money put me in tucumcari nm with 
nothing and i can do it again mackay said anyone can do it 
if they want to do it

retail prices rose faster than average incomes in 
some cities in the first quarter of 1988 and the nationwide 
inflation rate hit 11 percent the government announced tuesday 
the inflation rate up from a national average of 73 percent in 
1987 is the highest the government has reported since senior 
leader deng xiaoping began reducing central planning and price 
controls in favor of market reforms in 1978 
in 32 large and mediumsize cities retail prices rose 134 
percent the state statistical bureau said while average per 
capita incomes in urban areas only rose 13 percent to more than 90 
yuan or 24 per month 
average per capita income for rural residents rose 25 percent 
to 50 yuan or 1350 per month 
top officials have acknowledged widespread popular discontent 
over the rising prices and have announced corrective measures 
but they also have warned that inflation will remain high for 
several years as china strives to develop its backward economy and 
allow market factors to set prices 
zhang zhongji director of the statistic bureaus department of 
integrated statistics of the national economy told a news 
conference that the industrial sector maintained its rapid growth 
in the first quarter with output up 167 percent from the same 
period last year to the equivalent of 715 billion 
industrial output grew 165 percent during all of 1987 
vice premier yao yilin head of the state planning commission 
told a recent news conference that the governments goal was to 
keep inflation below 10 percent but added whether we will be 
able to achieve it i cant tell you 
his cautious assessment reflected the difficulty of the 
governments task to cool demand that is pushing prices up without 
curbing muchneeded economic growth 
uncontrolled investment in often irrational and competing 
projects and inadequate supplies of such goods as televisions and 
refrigerators have contributed to inflation 
the government has blamed inadquate investment in agriculture 
for high food prices and short supplies of meat in the cities 
zhang said grain production was expected to remain about the 
same as last year or 400 million tons despite repeated calls to 
stress grain production china has been unable to repeat its record 
1984 harvest of 407 million tons

vice president george bush recently pressured 
labor department officials to allow companies to avoid the expense 
of ventilating toxic gases from the workplace by making workers 
wear less effective but cheaper respirators instead a senate 
committee was told today 
as a result proposed standards are being prepared for white 
house approval that would allow greater use of personal respirators 
for shortterm exposure to toxic substances or when the cost of a 
cleanup is considered excessive scientists with the 
occupational safety and health administration testified 
the changes were first advocated five years ago by the task 
force on regulatory relief chaired by bush and were pushed by the 
vice president in a meeting last month with officials of the labor 
department the scientists said 
dr sheldon w weiner deputy director of health standards for 
osha and john martonik the agencys director of standards 
analysis said osha had effectively resisted the idea until january 
there is no way in my view that respirators can be as 
protective weiner said 
martonik agreed with that assessment but said the proposed 
regulations nontheless were sent to the white house with the 
changes called for by bushs task force 
it was a waste of our time as far as im concerned martonik 
told the senate labor committee we had to tie up five years 
working on this 
the committee was told monday that between 50000 and 70000 
americans are dying from occupational illnesses each year because 
the reagan administration has delayed new job health regulations 
and has not enforced existing standards 
dr philip j landrigan director of environmental and 
occupational medicine at mount sinai hospital in new york city 
offered those statistics monday and estimated another 350000 
workers incur illnesses each year because of inaction by the 
occupational safety and health administration 
john moran former director of safety research at the national 
institute of occupational safety and health said 2000 workers 
have been killed in socalled confined space accidents alone 
since 1980 when government safety officials first proposed a 
regulation to address the problem 
the proposed standard has never left the department of 
labor moran told the senate labor committee which opened three 
days of hearings into what chairman edward m kennedy called the 
fiddling away of workers lives by the occupational safety and 
health administration 
the confined space regulation recommended by osha safety experts 
in 1980 was intended to address the high incidence of workers who 
are electrocuted or otherwise killed or injured because there is 
not enough room to maneuver around dangerous equipment 
kennedy dmass vowed to develop a hearing record this week 
showing that the decision to let workers die while waiting on a 
standard or an inspection has been carried out by the highest 
levels of this administration 
assistant labor secretary and osha administrator john 
pendergrass is scheduled to testify wednesday before the panel 
which has had its staff investigating the agency for more than a 
year 
terry mikelson an osha spokesman called the figures of 
landrigan and moran amazing numbers and said agency officials 
would have no further comment until they appear before kennedys 
committee on wednesday 
landrigan testified monday that occupational exposures to toxic 
substances almost all of them arising out of manmade conditions 
and therefore preventable are raising mortality rates for 
certain forms of cancer 
as an example he said oshas decision not to reduce allowable 
exposures to benzene until 1987 will result in 19 to 65 leukemia 
deaths that otherwise would not occur he said the agency had the 
scientific evidence in 1981 to justify the reduction 
another seven to 48 workers will develop cancer and at least 
5900 more will contract respiratory ailments because osha delayed 
for five years recommended reductions in formaldehyde exposures 
landrigan said

corporations fledgling retail operation 
disney currently operates three stores that are not on

mailorder business last year 28 million copies of the walt

soybean futures prices closed sharply higher 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade and grains followed suit 
reflecting concern that supply problems may surface next fall 
the agriculture departments report on spring planting 
intentions is now nearly three weeks old but continues to have an 
impact on the market especially on soybean prices said ted mao 
an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the report indicated that soybean acreage would increase this 
year by about 1 percent analysts said that with only a slight 
increase in acreage weather conditions could play an unusually 
large role in the size of the harvest 
the corn market faces a similar scenario and early signs of 
dryness in the western corn belt may have touched off some buying 
interest tuesday mao said 
its certainly much too early to be too concerned about 
weather he said but since it looks like the overall acreage 
base is going to be small this year the market may be more 
sensitive to early weather problems 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 314 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 3 cents higher with may at 205 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 
3 cents higher with may at 168 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents

digital equipment corp on tuesday unveiled a new 
midrange computer line that analysts said was designed to head off 
expected product introductions by rival international business 
machines corp 
digital officials said the new vax 6200 series is designed to 
compete with ibms existing 9370 and 4381 computers 
digital based in maynard mass is the worlds secondlargest 
computer company and considered the industry leader in 
midperformance range computers 
the announcement of the vax 6200 series came one week after 
digital reported a 08 percent decrease in profits for the latest 
quarter while ibm announced a 163 percent rise reversing a 
twoyear trend in the battle between the companies 
the new computers which will cost between 131600 and 
653200 will be available immediately digital said 
the new systems are positioned squarely in the middle of the 
vax family and complement our current offerings william r 
demmer digitals vice president of midrange systems said in a 
statement 
digital introduced several mainframe computers in its vax 8800 
series last month in a direct challenge to ibm last year the 
company unveiled its microvax 3000 series designed for small 
departments 
analysts said the announcement was a strong tactical move for 
digital because the company needed to upgrade its midrange line 
before a rumored ibm development in the field 
its a good move for dec said bruce watts of needham amp co 
its partly intended to place them in a strongly competitive 
position when ibm announces its codenamed silverlake products this 
summer 
dec is getting their products out into the market first in 
order to prevent ibm from taking customers away he said 
the company said the singleprocessor 6210 computer provides 28 
times the performance of its vax 11780 system the system can 
accommodate up to four processors at once 
upgrades will cost betweem 100200 and 173500 digital said 
digitals earnings in its third fiscal quarter ending march 26 
totaled 3051 million or 233 a share down from 3076 million 
or 229 a share one year earlier 
the company had reduced its earnings estimates for the quarter 
because of sluggish sales of expensive computer systems and a shift 
in demand to smaller lines 
digital on tuesday also announced a new version of its vms 
software and a new fortran version for symmetric multiprocessing 
meanwhile ibm on tuesday announced upgraded software to take 
advantage of design changes in its mainframe computers

bethlehem steel corp announced on tuesday 
plans to pay more than 24 million in overdue preferred stock 
dividends and to sell 8 million shares of common stock to pare its 
17 billion unfunded pension liability 
one wall street analyst said the dividends are a sign of 
bethlehems faith in the steel industrys recovery after five years 
of massive losses plant closings and employment cuts 
it shows more of a conviction that what is actually happening 
in the steel markets is going to be more sustainable than most 
observers believe said dick henderson of donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette securities corp of new york steel demand is strong 
pricing is strong earnings are going to be strong 
the recovery seems very very broadbased he said it 
represents the participation of the steel industry in the socalled 
reindustrialization of america 
henderson said his enthusiasm for steel industry stocks 
especially bethlehems runs counter to the market he called 
bethlehem stock undervalued 
people are looking at the recoveries in the industrial and 
capital goods markets they know its happening but they dont 
believe it will continue he said 
bethlehem reported profits in each quarter last year and 174 
million profit for all of 1987 it was the first annual profit 
since 1981 and during the interim bethlehem lost more than 2 
billion 
the steelmaker said salomon brothers inc has agreed to 
underwrite the common stock offering which follows last falls 
sale of 12 million common shares and would raise the number of 
outstanding shares from the current 644 million to 724 million 
bethlehem stock fell 162 per share to 1937 in new york 
stock exchange composite trading after tuesdays announcement 
the companys board declared monday that on june 10 shareholders 
of record may 10 will be paid arrearages and second quarter 
dividends of 625 per share and 312 per share on bethlehems 5 
and 250 cummulative convertible preferred issues respectively 
dividends worth 225 million were omitted for the second half 
of 1986 and the first half of 1987 
the board also said the company will pay dividends june 11 on 
convertible preference shares issued to employees under contracts 
with the united steelworkers and other unions the dividends will 
be paid in additional shares with an aggregate stated value of 17 
million the dividend covers the period ending april 1 
the payments do not cover common stock dividends which have not 
been paid since the board declared 10 cents per share for the third 
quarter of 1985 unlike the preferred issues on which dividends 
accumulate the common issue does not require the company to pay a 
dividend 
bethlehem said it would report first quarter income at its 
annual shareholders meeting next tuesday

japan may begin phasing out quotas on us 
citrus and beef imports as early as next week to avoid rebuke by an 
international panel according to a top american trade official 
japan vetoed a us request two weeks ago for a special 
investigation of the quotas by the 92nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade but the united states plans to push the issue at 
gatts next council meeting may 4 
they know we will not allow a dispute panel to be blocked a 
second time michael samuels deputy us trade representative 
and ambassador to the gatt said in an interview with the san 
francisco chronicle monday 
japanese and american officials will discuss the matter next 
week in tokyo and samuels thinks japan may be ready to agree to a 
compromise 
they may not want to go to gatt and be found guilty of 
policy violations because that might offend their political 
sensitivities at home the ambassador said 
under a 1984 agreement that expired last month japan agreed to 
admit 177000 tons american beef and 86400 tons of us oranges 
this year pressure from the powerful japanese agriculture lobby 
has prevented an elimination of the quotas 
the united states wants a complete lifting of the quotas 
samuels said but the reagan administration is willing to accept a 
gradual elimination over a short period of time

a federal judge declared governmentowned 
aeromexico bankrupt and ordered it into receivership leaving the 
airlines more than 9200 workers jobless tuesday 
the decision followed a strike by the airlines technical 
workers that shut down the airline on april 12 in protest of 
management plans to reduce the fleet and route system to bring 
aeromexico back into the black 
the airline filed a petition for bankruptcy on friday saying it 
was losing 1 million a day because of the strike 
civil court judge sergio higuera mota issued the bankruptcy 
decree late monday the department of communications and 
transportation announced 
president miguel de la madrid said the bankruptcy petition was 
not an isolated case but part of a new policy to sell cut out or 
close down all moneylosing companies and agencies owned or 
operated by the government 
the country cannot give itself the luxury of having 
inefficient enterprises which constitute a burden to the entire 
society de la madrid said at an appearance monday in the 
northern industrial city of monterrey 
mexico has been suffering from acute inflation and other 
economic ills since 1982 when international prices for oil its 
no 1 export by far first dropped 
the strike had grounded all aeromexicos 223 daily flights to 42 
international and domestic destinations 
the aeromexico technicians and workers union called the protest 
strike after the airlines management announced plans to sell 13 
aircraft saying the sale would leave more than 2000 ground 
workers and cabin attendants without jobs 
pilots and cabin attendants have their own unions and did not 
support the strike 
rene arce the unions president said his organization would 
fight to keep the airline alive and reiterated that it was 
interested in trying to buy it he said the union could muster the 
support of a number of mexican and foreign investors but he did 
not identify them 
arce estimated the airline would cost 200 million to purchase 
including 70 million in estimated severance pay to workers 
in monterrey de la madrid told reporters that from now on the 
government will demand greater productivity including some 
radical restructuring as in the case of commercial aviation 
from its hundreds of moneylosing enterprises 
aeromexico started business in 1934 and has been owned by the 
government since 1957 the strike and the bankruptcy have not 
affected mexicana de aviacion the other major mexican airline 
which has been controlled by the government since 1982 
aeromexico employs 7200 ground workers and technicians 1200 
cabin attendants and 800 pilots

a mild stock rally fizzled late tuesday 
overwhelmed by computerized selling strategies and anxiety that has 
afflicted investors since the historic crash exactly six months ago 
the dow jones average of 30 bluechip stocks up more than 32 
points at midafternoon slid in the final hours and finished down 
862 to 199950 back under the 2000 level for the first time in 
two weeks most broader market indices also fell 
people are willing to venture into the market on a daybyday 
basis but not much longer said joseph barthel technical 
analyst at the butcher amp singer co investment firm without some 
sort of clarification i think were doomed to this type of 
whipsawed action 
the market strengthened through the early hours largely because 
of sharply higher earnings reported by some leading companies that 
comprise the dow average a partial recovery in the slumping bond 
market also helped by easing interest rates thereby making bonds a 
less attractive alternative to stocks 
but bonds weakened in the afternoon on renewed fears of 
inflation and fighting in the persian gulf traders said this 
helped provide an excuse to bail out of stocks and erase the days 
gains 
some said the decline was speeded by index arbitrage program 
trading the controversial strategy of selling large amounts of 
stocks and buying equivalent groups of stockindex futures or vice 
versa to profit from price disparities 
the result was a seesaw market dominated by professional 
traders as reflected in the relatively light new york stock 
exchange volume of 16191 million shares on monday the volume was 
even lighter at 14465 million shares 
volatility and uncertainty about the economy are keeping a lot 
of people on the sidelines said hugh johnson senior vice

black monday oct 19 it just sort of makes me think that even

grain and soybean futures prices rallied tuesday on the first 
weather scare of the season even though spring planting has barely 
begun 
soybeans advanced as much 7 cents a bushel on the chicago board 
of trade and the grains werent far behind as drought fears swept 
the pits 
on other markets energy futures retreated precious metals were 
mixed livestock and meat were mostly higher and stockindex 
futures retreated 
i think we had our first weather scare on the chicago board 
of trade said steve freed grain analyst for dean witter reynolds 
inc 
its certainly much too early to be too concerned about 
weather said ted mao grains specialist with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york but since it looks like the overall 
acreage base is going to be small this year the market may be more 
sensitive to early weather problems 
at the root of the dryweather concerns was the agriculture 
departments report on corn and soybean planting intentions the 
report issued nearly three weeks ago indicated only slight 
increases in us corn and soybean acreage 
analysts have said that because of the lowerthanexpected 
planting intentions growing conditions even slightly less than 
ideal could result in tight supplies of corn and beans 
the usda reported tuesday that inadequate moisture was causing 
problems for winter wheat growers in the central and northern 
plains wheat prices rallied on the news and nervous corn and 
soybean traders reacted as if those crops were sprouted and 
withering 
we havent even got the crop planted and were already killing 
it freed said 
wheat settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 314 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents 
higher with may at 205 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents 
higher with may at 168 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 7 
cents higher with may at 672 a bushel 
profittaking and technically inspired selling erased several 
days worth of gains in energy futures prices on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
there was not even a fairly good rumor today in the market 
that i could find to cause the sharp selloff said bob baker an 
analyst in new york with prudential bache securities inc 
crude oil for may delivery plunged below 1809 a barrel the 
price it settled at a week earlier may unleaded gasoline 
relinquished four days worth of advances while may heating oil 
erased two days worth of gains 
west texas intermediate heating oil settled 39 cents to 49 cents 
lower with may at 1803 a barrel heating oil was 82 cent to 101 
cents lower with may at 4968 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
92 cent to 116 cents lower with may at 5214 cents a gallon 
platinum futures also posted fairly steep losses on the new york 
mercantile exchange over on the commodity exchange also in new 
york gold futures fell slightly while silver gained a bit 
the 610 drop in july platinum to 53570 a troy ounce was 
only some fine tuning of what clearly is a very strong market 
said richard levine vice president of elders futures incs 
precious metals and foreign exchange group 
fundamentally platinum is very strong he said 
gold settled 1 to 160 lower with june at 46040 a troy 
ounce silver was 18 cents to 29 cents higher with may at 6465 
a troy ounce 
most cattle and pork futures advanced on the chicago mercantile 
exchange in response to higher cash prices analysts said 
live cattle were unchanged to 72 cent higher with april at 
7482 cents a pound feeder cattle were 12 cent lower to 45 cent 
higher with april at 7895 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent lower

gulf 
gold prices fell republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid of 45675 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm edt down from

traders said the dollar got a lift from a drop in the british 
pound the pound which has gained against all major currencies 
traded monday at a sixyear high against the dollar

because of the strength of the pound there was a potential for a 
cut in british interest rates said robert ryan senior trader at 
irving trust co 
those rumors took the pound down like a bullet and the 
dollar did better because of the weakness of the pound he said

clashed monday offered some support for the dollar iran attacked 
two neutral ships and more mines were sighted in the gulf tuesday 
were in a holding pattern with the middle east tensions 
said earl johnson a trader at harris trust and savings bank in 
chicago 
if those tensions fade into the background we might see the 
dollar slip because the underlying sentiment is still bearish 
in the wake of the trade numbers he said refering to last weeks 
report of a largerthanepected february trade deficit 
trading was uneventful earlier in europe where the dollar also 
edged marginally higher 
dealers there said a resumption of hostilities in the wartorn 
gulf region would boost the dollar but otherwise worries about 
the us economy would resume downward pressure on the us 
currency 
it may take another one or two weeks but the dollar will 
resume its downward trend predicted a londonbased trader for a 
japanese bank

the supreme court on tuesday upheld the power 
of states to control gasoline prices and oil industry profits in a 
ruling that state officials say will help protect the public when 
there are energy crises 
the justices voted 80 to reinstate regulations in puerto rico 
that limit oil company profits and prevent an excise tax from being 
passed on to consumers 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the absence 
of specific federal legislation on gasoline regulation leaves the 
states free to adopt such rules 
the ruling treats puerto rico a commonwealth as though it were 
a state and applies to all states 
scalia rejected oil industry arguments that congress by 
eliminating gasoline controls mandated a free market in petroleum 
products 
there may be a general congressional desire favoring the 
free market he said 
but unenacted approval beliefs and desires are not laws 
scalia added without a text that can plausibly be 
interpreted as prescribing federal preemption of state power it 
is impossible to find that a free market was mandated by federal 
law 
the ruling was hailed by jeffrey c genzer general counsel to 
the national association of state energy officials 
the governors need the ability to respond quickly when there 
are energy shortages he said 
ive heard it a million times when theyre standing in gas 
lines or dont have enough home fuel people come to the governor 
or the state energy director not to the federal government for 
help he added 
genzer said the ruling may not have great immediate impact 
because there are no oil shortages now that require emergency state 
action 
but he said that without tuesdays decision states could be 
powerless for example to enforce socalled setaside programs 
requiring that a percentage of gasoline be reserved for 
toppriority needs when there are shortages most states have laws 
that give governors broad emergency powers to protect fuel supplies 
the american petroleum institute said the ruling could have a 
severe impact on the oil industry and the public if states adopt 
regulations similar to those in puerto rico 
the experience with price controls in the 1970s should serve 
as a reminder that consumers are best served by free markets the 
industry group said in a statement 
the supreme court ruling overturns a 1986 decision by a federal 
appeals court here that said congress intended to bar state 
regulation of the oil industry when it lifted controls on gasoline 
effective in 1981 
congress authorized the federal government in 1970 to place 
controls on petroleum products in an effort to curb inflation that 
law expired in 1973 
congress in the wake of an arab oil embargo then enacted an 
emergency law placing extensive price and allocation controls on 
gasoline 
that was followed in 1975 by a new law aimed at promoting oil 
conservation the 1975 law was amended later to provide for gradual 
deregulation and give the president sweeping authority to lift 
controls selectively 
complete deregulation by the federal government was required as 
of sept 30 1981 
puerto rico which previously had suspended its regulation of 
petroleum products while the federal controls were in effect 
placed an excise tax on oil refiners in 1986 
the puerto rico department of consumer affairs then issued 
regulations requiring advance notice of price increases 
prohibiting wholesalers from passing on the cost of the excise tax 
to retailers and imposing maximum profit margins on sales by 
wholesalers to retailers 
puerto ricos regulations challenged in a lawsuit by oil 
companies were supported by the reagan administration and state 
and local officials the national governors association the 
national association of counties and the us conference of mayors 
were among the groups that urged the supreme court to rule in favor 
of puerto rico 
justice sandra day oconnor did not take part in tuesdays 
ruling

two years ago hancock estimated conservatively that at least 
some mention of its sponsorship of the race reached 750 million 
people worldwide which it said was the equivalent of roughly 82 
million in advertising 
the race on monday ended in the closest finish in the 92year 
history of the boston marathon with ibrahim hussein of kenya 
crossing the finish line a second ahead of juma ikangaa of tanzania 
it was a great race mahoney said the only thing that 
could have been better would have been a dead heat 
hancock is not alone in reaping the harvest of good will and 
free publicity 
most of the major newspapers in the country carried photographs 
of the runners ricoh corps name was emblazoned on the runners 
number tags 
coverage of the race was likely to mention that the men and 
women winners got a mercedes benz 
and any pictures from the finish area were likely to catch a 
glimpse of the silver mylar blankets bearing the nestlechunky logo 
that were given to each of the 6700 runners 
hancock goes to great lengths to make sure there are no snags in 
the transmitting of all that publicity 
on race day journalists occupied two large function rooms at 
the copley plaza hotel near the finish line part of the staff of 
some 900 hancock volunteers kept a steady flow of information 
coming to the reporters from a ricoh copier brought in for the 
occasion camera crews and pool reporters moved ahead of the 
leaders in a mercedes benz media truck 
i still think it will grow in terms of media said mahoney 
some 1200 journalists covered the marathon on monday he said 
in the early 1980s the question of whether the marathon would 
have corporate sponsorship was debated hotly some argued that the 
race should retain its amateur status but some race organizers were 
concerned that boston would be eclipsed as the premier marathon by 
others offering prize money 
race director guy morse of the boston athletic association 
doesnt miss the old days 
weve been able to protect the boston marathon as a unique 
traditionsteeped event while at the same time bringing those 
elements needed to make it among the best in the world morse 
said

a new yorkbased firm seeking control of gillette 
co filed a countersuit in federal court tuesday claiming the 
personal care giant misrepresented facts in recent legal action and 
material sent to shareholders 
the countersuit by two coniston partners subsidiaries is the 
latest in a series of exchanges in the courts and in newspapers 
over conistons attempt to oust four gillette directors at 
thursdays annual meeting in andover 
the coniston suit alleges gillette presented misleading and 
false statements in material sent to its nearly 27000 shareholders 
and run in newspapers urging rejection of conistons takeover 
attempt said victor lewkow one of conistons attorneys 
lewkow said coniston took issue with an indication by gillette 
that coniston was interested in a greenmail payment to abandon 
its bid greenmail is the term used when a company buys back its 
stock from a potential suitor at a premium above the market price 
lewkow said the countersuit by rb associates of new jersey and 
bahamasbased rb partners also seeks dismissal of a gillette suit 
filed last week 
the action does not try to block the annual meeting lewkow 
said he said coniston could see monetary damages against gilette 
on april 14 gillette filed suit in federal court seeking to 
block coniston from soliciting votes from shareholders gillette 
claims coniston violated federal laws by issuing material that did 
not fully outline all partners and investors affiliated with the 
takeover attempt 
on tuesday judge rya zobel ordered an april 29 hearing for both 
suits 
conistons slate of director candidates includes the three 
coniston principals and david strassler who was also named as a 
defendant in the gillette suit shareholders can vote in person or 
by proxy ballot 
conistons bid received a boost monday when the california 
public employees retirement fund the fifthlargest gillette 
shareholder with about 15 million shares announced it will vote 
for the coniston candidates 
results of the voting are not expected for at least a week 
following the meeting gillette said its suit should not delay the 
meeting 
the two coniston partnerships have accumulated 676 million 
gillette shares or about 58 percent of the companys shares 
outstanding 
in several letters to shareholders since march gillette 
chairman and chief executive officer colman mockler jr claimed 
coniston plans to sell or dismember the bostonbased company 
coniston states it can boost company profitability and stock 
prices at gillette which paid nearly 580 million in late 1986 to 
halt revlon group incs repeated takeover attempts 
gillette laid off nearly 2400 workers and sold several 
unprofitable divisions during restructuring after revlon signed a 
10year agreement not to seek control of the company

the house on tuesday approved a nationwide ban 
on dialaporn telephone pornography services despite arguments 
that the bill was unconstitutional 
the legislation identical to an amendment approved earlier in 
the senate was included in an 83 billion education bill passed 
397 to 1 after lawmakers handed democratic leaders a defeat and 
rejected a lesssweeping antiporn provision 
final senate action on the package was expected wednesday 
some may question the constitutionality of this measure 
said rep ralph hall dtexas but it is the most 
straightforward 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house committee on 
energy and commerce called the measure extraordinarily shaky 
on constitutional grounds 
barry w lynn legislative counsel of the american civil 
liberties union said the ban clearly intrudes on the privacy and 
the freespeech rights of adult americans this is a hopelessly 
inept way of dealing with the issue of childrens access to 
dialaporn which should be the only matter under consideration 
he predicted years of litigation and in the process 
increased access by children to dialaporn the situation would 
get worse because current federal communications commission rules 
protecting children from telephone pornography would be thrown away 
in the process he said 
sen jesse helms rnc first won the dialaporn ban 
amendment 980 when the senate first passed the otherwise 
noncontroversial education bill but the house had included no 
similar provision in its version of the bill and a compromise less 
legally controversial provision was approved by housesenate 
conferees 
while the helms amendment contained a total ban on the services 
for adults as well as children the education bills provision 
would have had telephone companies block access to dialaporn 
unless the telephone customer an adult specifically requested 
they be made available 
opponents of the compromise said it was too weak and pointed out 
that about 12 percent of the nations telephone exchanges did not 
have the technology to block out the service to some homes but not 
to others 
in an attempt to satisfy both sides house leaders on tuesday 
orchestrated the vote on a new separate but otherwise identical 
dialaporn bill the plan was to have both versions approved with 
the education bills language available if the total ban failed to 
pass constitutional muster 
the separate bill passed the house 37922 but then in a defeat 
for democratic leaders the house inserted it into the education 
bill in place of the compromise 
house republicans carried the day after accusing the democratic 
leaders of trying to block the flatout ban 
rep thomas bliley rva who sponsored the helms amendment in 
the house called the democrats process a charade by lawmakers 
hoping the ban would be blocked in the senate 
he called the limited protections in the education compromise 
akin to telling someone its illegal to sell someone drugs 
unless someone walks up to them and asks for some 
voting against the dialaporn ban when it came up as a 
separate bill were reps anthony beilenson dcalif howard

federal safety inspectors told a senate 
committee tuesday they were instructed last september to generate 
numbers through sham inspections emphasizing quantity over 
improving the quality of the nations workplaces 
because the office was short on numbers for the year they 
wanted compliance officers to generate double the number of osha 1 
inspection reports dr john barry an industrial hygienist in 
the agencys philadelphia regional office testified tuesday 
barry and other field inspectors stationed in texas described in 
the second day of hearings by the senate labor committee how the 
occupational safety and health administration boosted its 
inspection totals last year by more than 2000 
the committee chaired by sen edward m kennedy dmass has 
been preparing the hearings for more than a year none of the seven 
republicans on the panel have attended the first two days 
before the first witness was called monday kennedy vowed to 
show that the decision to let workers die has been supervised 
and carried out by the highest levels of this administration 
assistant labor secretary michael baroody and osha administrator 
john pendergrass are scheduled to testify before the panel on 
wednesday 
im sure well be able to set the record straight then 
terry mikelson an osha spokesman said tuesday when asked for the 
agencys response to allegations raised so far in the hearings 
two senior osha officials testified tuesday that because of 
intervention by vice president george bush last month they are now 
rewriting regulations to enable some companies to avoid the expense 
of venting toxic gases from some workplaces by instead making 
workers wear less effective personal respirators 
career bureaucrats in osha believed they had won a sevenyear 
fight with the white house office of management and budget over the 
respirator proposal until bush met on march 22 with omb officials 
and baroody 
as a result of that meeting proposed standards are being 
prepared for white house approval that would allow greater use of 
personal respirators for shortterm exposure to toxic substances or 
when the cost of engineered ventilation controls are considered 
excessive the committee was told 
the current regulations in effect since 1981 establish a 
hierarchy of preferred methods for protecting workers from toxic 
gases at the top of that hierarchy are the oftenexpensive 
ventilation systems 
if ventilation is impractical employers can alter their work 
practices such as rotating workers in and out of hazardous areas 
at the bottom of the current heirarchy are personal respirators 
the task force on regulatory relief chaired by bush in 1981 
recommended altering that hierarchy to recognize technical 
improvements in respirators as opposed to the blanket regulation of 
ventilation systems everywhere said steve hart bushs press 
secretary 
there is no way in my view that respirators can be as 
protective sheldon weiner deputy director of health standards 
for osha told the committee tuesday acknowledging that white 
house calls for new regulations were met with stiff resistence 
its a waste of our time as far as im concerned added john 
martonik an official in oshas health standards office 
nonetheless martonik testified tuesday we have finished 
redrafting it for submittal to omb for review 
weiner and martonik said the respirator issue was revived as a 
direct result of bushs meeting with baroody 
after the meeting baroody wrote a memorandum to pendergrass 
about the 48 months of delay on the respirator issue and similar 
delays on three other changes that had been recommended by bushs 
task force 
omb was critical of the department of labor for failing to 
meet its commitments and deadlines baroody said in the march 28 
memo the vice president affirmed this and expressed his personal 
interest and concern in completing the regulatory agenda 
established by the task force 
hart bushs spokesman described the meeting as a broad review 
of each agencys success or failure in carrying out the task 
forces recommendations 
the vice president didnt set his sights on this particular 
regulatory item but on the entire unfilled agenda hart said 
in the spirit of lets get going on these items he said we need 
to make this part of our agenda for the remainder of the year 
kennedy meanwhile repeated his charges tuesday saying that 
career osha employees were instructed by reagan administration 
officials to generate misleading data that give the appearance of 
zeal as a cover for neglect 
were going to have a new administration after this fall and 
hopefully we can get this agency back on track again he said 
after tuesdays hearing 
michelle vallon an industrial hygienist in oshas irving 
texas office told the committee tuesday that she produced 25 osha 
inspection reports from a threeday visit to a construction site 
last september 
ms vallon said she believes she was told by supervisors to 
inspect the site because of a large number of subcontractors on the 
job and her office was nearing the end of the fiscal year and had 
not met its quota of inspections 
they didnt exactly say it but i drew that conclusion she 
said in response to a question from kennedy we were under 
constant pressure to get numbers 
in response to another question from kennedy ms vallon agreed 
with his assertion that the inspection program essentially was a 
sham 
osha records show that the number of its inspections rose from 
59452 in fiscal 1986 to 61466 last year but were still 3 percent 
below what they were in 1980 the last year of president carters 
administration 
inspections of manufacturing plants also have declined by 45 
percent in the past seven years but inspections of construction 
sites have increased by 35 percent over the same time to 35495 
last year 
osha officials have repeatedly defended that record as switching 
the agencys resources to where the greatest hazards exist 
construction 
unions however have maintained that the policy also has 
allowed the agency to inflate its enforcement activity by 
counting each subcontractor on the site as a separate inspection 
most sites average seven to eight contractors meaning that in 
reality only 4500 to 5000 construction sites were visited 
united steelworkers president lynn williams told the committee 
earlier

president reagan on tuesday took issue with 
critics of administration space plans and asked congress and the 
american people to join me in making the longterm investment 
required to advance us leadership in space 
can we afford to stop our exploration and wait for others to 
pass us reagan asked in a speech at the annual 
governmentindustry dinner of the electronic industries association 
the space station is vital to our leadership in space and 
contributes to our preeminence in manned space flight the 
president said some say we cant afford the space station 
but he asked can we afford to jettison the next generation 
of technical spinoffs 
tonight i ask congress and all the american people to join me 
in making the longterm investment required to advance us 
leadership in space reagan said we must begin that investment 
by funding the increases ive proposed for our civil space 
program 
reagan also said it was administration policy to encourage 
private sector investment and involvement in outer space 
we will help develop a highway to space by using private 
launch services to the greatest extent feasible and we are working 
to win legislation to limit liability for commercial launch 
providers he said 
its a future beyond the most distant star in our dreams that 
beckons us reagan told the electronics executives and to 
those who say it cant be reached that its impossible id just 
point toward your industries and ask if a few years ago they 
thought what you are doing today would also be impossible 
the president also put in a plug for the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars his proposal for a spacebased defense 
against nuclear missiles 
five years ago i proposed sdi and much to my satisfaction we 
have made tremendous progress in that research he said we 
must not stop dreaming because a few naysayers insist on limiting 
our options for a safe and secure future
