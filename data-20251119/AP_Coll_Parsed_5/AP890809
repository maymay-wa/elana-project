a northwest airlines dc10 made an emergency 
landing wednesday after the trimotor jets no 2 engine apparently 
began breaking up and the pilot shut it down officials said 
flight 308 carrying 256 people from los angeles to minneapolis 
landed without incident at stapleton international airport 
wednesday about 630 pm according to richard boulware a 
spokesman at the airport 
they experienced a severe vibration from the no 2 engine 
and as a precautionary measure they elected to make an 
unscheduled landing said kevin whalen a spokesman for the st 
paul minnbased airline 
the no 2 engine of a dc10 also is the focus of an 
investigation into the crash of united airlines flight 232 last 
month in sioux city iowa killing 111 of the nearly 300 people 
aboard 
flight 232s no 2 engine apparently disintegrated shooting 
shrapnel that apparently severed hydraulic lines in the jet 
causing almost complete loss of control and forcing the 
crashlanding at sioux citys airport 
the investigation into the cause of that disaster is continuing 
boulware who observed the damage to the aircraft after it 
landed wednesday night said there were multiple shrapnellike 
holes in the outer cowling of the no 2 engine which on a dc10 
is mounted in the vertical stabilizer at the tail of the aircraft 
the other two engines are mounted under the wings 
one of the holes was big enough i could have stuck by hand 
through he said he said the holes were along the upper side of 
the engine cowling whatever exited exited upward he said 
he also said a service door on the tail about eight inches 
square had been blown open but remained attached to its hinges 
whalen said the landing was normal in terms of controlling the 
airplane and the 245 passengers were being placed on alternate 
flights to minneapolis there were 11 crew members on board he 
said 
whalen said the airlines mechanics will take a close look at 
the engine and since northwest doesnt have a maintenance base in 
denver the jet might have to be shuttled to minneapolis

a woman battling for control of seven 
microscopic embryos said she worried about frozen storage killing 
them but her husband said bringing them to life was a mistake 
the couple junior lewis davis and mary sue davis drew a 
portrait of themselves tuesday as a couple who tried desperately 
for nine years to have a child 
their marriage has collapsed into a battle for custody or 
ownership of seven frozen preembryos that have been in 
cryogenic storage since december 
davis 30 sued for divorce in february and wants the embryos 
to remain in storage until the couple decide together what to do 
with them 
i oppose the use of the preembryos by mary or any donor 
because i do not wish to be raped of my reproductive rights he 
said 
mrs davis says she has the right to have the embryos implanted 
in her womb regardless of her husbands feelings 
i dont feel it abuses his rights she testified he 
consented to be a father and im willing to let him 
mrs davis said she objects strongly to leaving the embryos in 
cold storage where according to some testimony they could not last 
for more than two years 
i believe that would be killing them she said i am the 
mother of these embryos they are the beginning of life they are 
more than just cells that mean nothing 
davis acknowledged his wife has gone through physical and 
emotional trauma during their six attempts at conception in the in 
vitro program which they entered in 1985 
but i cant see where thats enough to bring a child into this 
world where the child will have more pain than it cost us to 
achieve it he said 
i dont want my child in a singleparent home davis told w 
dale young the blount county circuit court judge hearing the case 
i was raised in a broken home and i dont want that for my 
child 
both junior and mary sue davis 28 come from families of six 
children 
mrs davis attorney jay christenberry contends the embryos 
should be considered preborn children and allowed to come to 
term in mrs davis body 
charles clifford attorney for davis said there have been 
tremendous advances in helping infertile women such as mrs davis 
he contends that because she could reasonably expect to become 
pegnant with another man after her divorce it is unnecessary to 
use these particular seven embryos 
under his questioning zoologist alex shivers said the success 
rate of in vitro programs will definitely go up in coming 
years testimony monday indicated the national average for 
successful implantations is 18 percent 
the davises said they met in west germany while in the army and 
married nine years ago mrs davis suffered five tubal pregnancies 
one of which she said nearly killed her 
the couple tried adoption only to be told they had little 
chance of becoming parents that way they joined the big brothers 
program taking a child under their wing until its mother started 
using us sort of as a babysitting service davis said 
the trial which began monday recessed until thursday 
young is expected to rule within a month 
the embroyos are in cryogenic storage at minus 180 degrees 
centigrade 
davis said he does not want the embryos destroyed just left 
alone three years down the road i might have a change of 
heart he said 
in vitro fertilization produces socalled testtube babies 
because the fertilization takes place outside the womb the process 
was pioneered in england where the first successful birth was 
recorded in 1978 
the embryos in the davis case were less than two days old when 
they were frozen and consist of four to eight undifferentiated 
cells each according to testimony it is 12 to 14 days after 
fertilization before the cells start to take on different 
characteristics and technically are considered embryos scientists 
testified

after a twomonth false start japans governing 
party is on another clean start to reform itself 
the false start was under sousuke uno who became prime minister 
june 2 with pledges of political reform but soon was pursued by 
allegations of having kept paid mistresses 
now another veteran legislator with no personal power base has 
been pulled up to lead the liberal democratic party 
there was an eerie sense of deja vu in toshiki kaifus 
acceptance remarks if he had unos glasses and streak of white 
hair it would have been hard to discern that japan had a new 
leader 
uno was clear of involvement in the recruit influencebuying 
scandal that caused his predecessor noboru takeshita to leave 
office prematurely 
kaifu bears the minor taint of receiving the equivalent of 
110000 in donations from recruit co over five years but he did 
not receive profits from cutprice stock deals as did most of the 
party leaders now sidelined 
that scandal uno said on june 2 has had a dramatic effect on 
our party i would like to take this opportunity to reflect on this 
development so we can make a clean start in politics and regain the 
confidence of our people 
kaifu said tuesday after winning the party presidency that it 
was a crucial time he called for debate through which we can 
gain the peoples understanding of our policies 
i want to carry out reforms and pass reform legislation based 
on our deep selfreflection he said we must carry out 
political reforms and shed our old skin 
like uno and takeshita and almost everyone else in his 
conservative party kaifu said the liberal democrats were in a 
crisis 
the crisis appears deeper than ever and the calendar is moving 
steadily toward the next encounter with the electorate 
in elections july 23 the liberal democrats lost constrol of 
parliaments upper house for the first time in the partys 34year 
history 
elections for all seats in the lower house must be called by 
july 1990 but the socialistled opposition in the upper chamber 
will try to create a legislative deadlock to make the government 
hold them sooner 
so low is the liberal democrats popularity that analysts expect 
they would lose their majority in the lower house 
the reasons are many and not easy to overcome 
despite a pledge not to impose a new major tax the governing 
party bulldozed a 3 percent sales tax through parliament 
when it was coupled with reductions in personal income and 
inheritance taxes the net effect was a reduction in the average 
households tax burden but the sales tax remains unpopular it 
also produces 10 percent of government revenue which makes 
abolishing it expensive 
although the recruit scandal ended officially in april with the 
indictment of two legislators on bribetaking charges it lives on 
in the minds of many who feel party leaders should not have escaped 
prosecution among those who did was yasuhiro nakasone who 
preceded takeshita as prime minister 
the easy money politicians reaped from the recruit co was 
spread so widely that nearly all top liberal democratic figures 
were tainted making it impossible for them to succeed takeshita or 
uno they remain powerful however and voters know many hope for 
future high office 
to the sales tax and recruit scandal which created an image of 
arrogance and unaccountability was added the insult to women of 
unos alleged affairs the result was the thrashing the liberal 
democrats took in the july 23 election 
takako doi the first woman to lead a party in japan is popular 
and has been able to fuzz over her socialist partys policy of an 
unarmed neutral japan which is not the majority opinion she 
attacks the sales tax and the governing partys image 
kaifu is new and untried he is 58 still boyishlooking young 
enough in japanese politics to suggest a new generation and has 
reform credentials from service under takeo miki a mr clean 
prime minister of the 1970s 
he has until october when the party votes again on its 
president to show he has made a good start on rescuing the deeply 
troubled party 
if he doesnt japan could be looking for its fourth prime 
minister of 1989

cbs is firmly behind the the pat sajak 
show as the latenight talkfest struggles against reigning king 
johnny carson and his tonight show the shows producer said 
cbs has just told me do what it takes to make it work and 
well stick by you paul gilbert said in a recent interview 
the show featuring sajak of wheel of fortune fame debuted 
with good ratings seven months ago but has since dropped to third 
place 
gilbert said the show has been revamped the blue couch is gone 
replaced by a beige one only four guests will now appear nightly 
instead of five a change gilbert said was made to allow pat time 
to sink his teeth into an interview 
most significantly sajaks monologue will run in the middle of 
the show or not at all we figure it doesnt make sense to 
compete against carson with his act gilbert said

the pies lining the two shelves behind 
the counter at the club cafe have always been in demand now 
theyre in court 
when robert mcnanna bought 51 percent of the cafe in may he 
thought he was buying the restaurants awardwinning recipes too 
but then the baker mary allen a former partowner who had the 
recipes in her head quit and mcnanna sued to get the recipes back 
theyre not written down someplace said mrs allens 
attorney steven oliver the recipes are something my client has 
developed over many years 
attorneys still are taking depositions and will request a final 
hearing in a month or so in chancery court to determine ownership 
of the recipes oliver said 
in the meantime the 45yearold club cafe still offers for 1 
a slice 14 varieties of pies peanut butter chocolate coconut 
banana lemon pineapple egg custard pecan apple dutch apple 
cherry blueberry banana split and strawberry and four 
cheesecakes 
mcnanna says the pies these days are every bit as good as mrs 
allens and his baker ricky west a 14year veteran at the 
restaurant agrees 
the pies we have it down to an art mcnanna said just 
right after she quit we had it down pretty close 
the customers they cant tell the difference west said 
but some say they can 
my opinion is that the crust isnt as good said larry 
williams an administrative assistant for a judge whos been a 
regular at the cafe for about five years 
if youve had the way the pies used to be you know whats 
genuine and whats imitation williams said we true hot 
springs natives could brag that we had the best pies in arkansas 
businessman barry horner has been indulging in club cafe pies 
since he was a teenager 30 years ago when he was known as the 
dutch apple kid 
horner said he couldnt quite put his finger on the difference 
it seems like its not quite up to what it used to be he 
said but theyre still good pies 
tammy lawrence 19 who used to help out at the restaurant when 
her mother worked there said she cant taste any difference and 
shes sampled everything on the pie menu 
they taste the same to me the meringue has a different 
texture but the fillings are the same she said 
west said he cranks out 50 to 70 pies a day a job he calls more 
stressful than his old duty of cooking the main meals the 
chocolate pie one of several crowned with 3 inches of meringue is 
his customers favorite with coconut next he said 
under a temporary restraining order issued in may mrs allen 
has been barred from the club cafe premises and is working as a 
waitress at a local oriental restaurant oliver said there are no 
orders preventing her from baking elsewhere 
mrs allen filed a counterclaim in june asking that the sale of 
the 51 percent share to mcnanna be rescinded because of a dispute 
over payment on a 40000 banknote for her mother and aunt who 
each owned a 20 percent share in the cafe mrs allen had owned the 
remaining 11 percent sold to mcnanna 
mrs allens husband frank still owns 29 percent of the 
restaurant and west owns the remaining 20 percent 
monty montgomery owner of montys pawn shop said hes gone 
into the cafe just about every day since 1954 and has seen a lot of 
changes though the same faded redandwhite club cafe sign 
still hangs over the door 
five to six years ago you could come here for lunch and 
thered be a line out the door montgomery said but until the 
last couple of months that wasnt the case anymore he said 
there are lots of new faces montgomery said more 
tourists seem to be coming in here 
its kind of funny getting all the publicity west said

president bush said he would be willing to 
negotiate for the release of american hostages held in the middle 
east if it could be done without endangering others according to a 
published interview 
i have no problem with that if i can talk to somebody and 
get the release of an american hostage and do it without in my 
view or in the view of the experts putting others at risk of 
being taken hostage bush said in an interview appearing in 
wednesdays editions of the boston globe 
i have no reason to say that i can see in the short run a 
total resolution of the american hostage problem i wish i could 
he said 
bush said he would continue using quiet diplomacy rather than 
military force to resolve the crisis 
i have tried to keep from escalating matters by making a lot 
of loud threats he said i have had to take certain prudent 
actions we are trying to handle this where diplomacy can be 
most effective 
but the president played down the possibility of imminent 
freedom for the eight american hostages held in the middle east 
the bush administration tuesday rejected the idea of swapping the 
captives in lebanon for 2 billion in iranian assets frozen nearly 
ago decade ago 
state department spokesman richard boucher dismissed the 
possibility of such an exchange the questions of the assets have 
no connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue he 
said 
the president said he was satisfied that the us 
intelligence network in lebanon had improved in recent years but 
we still dont have the intelligence that i would like to have if 
we had better intelligence we might be able to surgically extract 
the americans that are still held hostage 
white house officials said later that us representatives would 
debrief united nations envoy marrack goulding wednesday in new york 
about his weeklong tour of the middle east

beachgoers ready to frolic in us coastal 
waters should be prepared to encounter contamination from toxic 
chemicals sewage discharge and medical waste a private 
environmental group said today 
few regions of the country have escaped the effects of coastal 
pollution the washingtonbased natural resources defense council 
said in a report released today 
the report which examined a variety of ocean pollutants 
suggested the trend toward growing coastal contamination can be 
reversed over the next decade but only through strict pollution 
control measures and curbs in development along coastal areas 
each year our factories dump no less than 5 trillion gallons 
of wastewater into coastal waters the report said 
we flush another 23 trillion gallons of sewage into them and 
every time it rains or snows massive amounts of poisonous 
substances including gasoline and pesticides are carried into the 
sea as runoff from our city streets and farms 
half of the nations population lives within 50 miles of coastal 
waters including the great lakes system the report said noting 
that the population in many coastal regions is expected to increase 
sharply over the next decade 
the report cited as examples of the coastal pollution problem 
the environmental protection agencys designation of three 
locations in washingtons puget sound as priority toxic cleanup 
sites under the federal superfund law because of sediment 
contamination 
the closing of parts of maines casco bay in recent years to 
clam and mussel digging because of bacterial pollution from 
inadequately treated sewage that was allowed into the waters 
sediments in the bay also were found to be contaminated with heavy 
metals pcbs and an assortment of pesticides 
continued high levels of the toxic pesticide ddt in 
californias santa monica bay 20 years after it was dumped into the 
water by industry the pesticide was banned in 1972 
the forced closing of at least 40 beaches in new york new 
jersey and connecticut during the first three weeks of this summer 
because of sewage contamination 
the oil industrys routine dumping into offshore waters of 
thousands of tons of waste material including drilling mud 
that contains toxic chemicals 
medical waste on beaches which attracted widespread attention 
last summer continues to be a problem the report said such 
wastes have been reported on beaches in 17 states this summer 
even supposedly clean beaches are far from safe said the 
report entitled ebb tide for pollution 
about onefourth of all sewage wastewater is dumped directly 
into coastal waters and much more is released into rivers that 
eventually reaches the ocean the report said pollution from a 
variety of sources increasingly is showing up in fish and shellfish 
in many parts of the country it said 
even the us army corps of engineers contributes to the 
problem the report said 
of up to 700 million cubic yards of material dredged by the 
corps from harbors and channels each year as much as 35 million 
cubic yards are highly contaminated from pesticides heavy metals 
pcbs and oil according to the study much of the dredged material 
is dumped in the ocean 
the environmental group called for tighter controls on toxic 
industrial pollutants as well as runoff pollutants from agriculture 
and other sources a ban on all discharges of raw sewage into 
waters and more effective treatment programs and tighter landuse 
and zoning requirements to curb coastal development 
it also urged a halt of ocean dumping of medical wastes or the 
discharge of plastics from vessels sewers or other sources and a 
comprehensive program to protect coastal waters from oil spills 
including a tightening of restrictions on offshore drilling and 
tanker shipments

drug abuse is not merely a black problem 
but a national dilemma that will require major resources to solve 
say leaders attending the national urban league convention 
we cant talk about the future we want to see for urban 
america without talking about the no 1 threat in our inner cities 
today illegal drugs president bush told the league tuesday as 
the drug issue received heavy attention from the largely black 
organization 
urban league president john e jacob in an interview tuesday 
said we believe the federal government ought to mobilize 
this nation to a realization that this is not a black problem but a 
national problem that will require national resources 
but jacob and others attending the meeting called for efforts to 
protect the innocent during crackdowns in housing projects 
the league today concludes its fourday convention which 
included a puppet show at a forum on drug abuse 
lottie v jones president of the national council on alcoholism 
and other dependencies on tuesday showed off the puppets her 
detroitbased group uses to teach families the dangers of drug 
abuse 
ronald pogue senior vice president of compdrugs inc of 
columbus ohio told the drug forum what sells in this country 
right now is the notion that the drug problem is primarily a 
minority problem 
it is much easier for this country to buy into the notion that 
it is a minority problem because then there is no compelling urge 
to do anything about it pogue said 
however jacob contended the drug issue has not been swept under 
the rug 
i think that the whole issue of dealing with drugs is 
intimidating he said it has required that our community 
become consciously more aggressive in attacking that problem 
because it is not an easy problem to attack nor is it a safe one 
to become involved with 
now we are talking about our community developing 
relationships with the police and authorities that will ultimately 
lead to people getting locked up jacob said that is contrary 
to the gentle nature of africanamericans toward each other and is 
really inconsistent with the value system that we have had about 
the extended family concept 
now jacob said blacks are seeing that the entire family must 
be more important than those persons who would violate the trust of 
the family 
secretary of housing and urban development jack kemp brought up 
the subject of fairness telling delegates tuesday we are going 
to be tough on drugs but we are going to be tough for due process 
too 
jacob asked if due process protections were a major concern for 
the black community said i think it is a major concern that 
people do not be penalized because of someone in their families 
that might be using drugs that they had no control over 
we dont want to create a climate in which people just run 
roughshod through the housing projects eliminating people because 
they just look like they use drugs he said 
but jacob asked whether tight budgetary restrictions might harm 
the war against drugs said i dont think it will be as tough 
for drugs as it will be for a lot of things there are white 
americans who are just as scared about whats happening with drugs 
as the black community

one of the quirkier statistics presented at a 
convention of statisticians here indicates that men should get 
married have children and get divorced if they want to be promoted 
on a university faculty 
another statistic concerned the sale of tshirts but it was 
less precise 
among more than 1000 scholarly papers being presented at the 
joint meetings of the american statistical association the 
biometrical society and the institution of mathematical 
statisticians was one by lynne billard of the university of 
georgia who studied promotion rates on college faculties 
heres what she found about the path of advancement from 
assistant to associate professor 
among those who were married but childless 51 percent of the 
men and 41 percent of the women were promoted 
among those who had spouses and children 66 percent of the men 
and 51 percent of the women were promoted 
among those who were single divorced or widowed and childless 
53 percent of the men and 37 percent of the women were promoted 
among those who were unmarried and had children 80 percent of 
the men and 33 percent of the women were promoted 
ms billard in a paper reflecting the jargon of her industry 
the standardized regression coefficients in the prediction 
equations for men and women drew no conclusions although the 
moral was clear 
for male assistant professors the way to get ahead is to get 
married have children and get divorced for women that path leads 
to stagnation 
as for tshirts vendor mary cuzzucoli said statisticians seemed 
to snap them up 
a couple of hundred arrived at her table at 740 am tuesday 
and by 9 am they were all sold she said they bore this legend 
im statistically significant 
bumper stickers using a play on the statistical term moment 
moved more slowly statisticians may be dull but we have our 
moments 
the annual august meeting filled two washington hotels and 
brought together 4215 statisticians to observe the 150th year of 
the asa which was founded in boston and whose membership has 
included florence nightingale alexander graham bell andrew 
carnegie and martin van buren 
the meetings youngest presenter of a paper was 16yearold 
nirmal dc pugh a junior at the mahrishi school in fairfield 
iowa his topic was multivariate vs univariate time series 
forecasts of weather variables 
hes an old hand at delivering papers having previously done so 
before the international neuroscience conference 
outgoing asa president janet norwood who heads the governments 
bureau of labor statistics noted in a speech that her bureau used 
to draw moral conclusions from the numbers it gathered 
for example she said in 1888 studying the conditions of women 
workers the bureau found that those living in rooming houses had 
to receive guests in their rooms because there was no other place 
it concluded such a condition tends either in the direction 
of crushing out social intercourse especially between the sexes 
or of carrying it beyond the limit of prudence

former marine lt col oliver north is 
beginning his service as a draftee in the war against narcotics by 
helping reformed drug dealers and other underworld figures to repay 
their crimes 
the national security aide who directed some of the reagan 
administrations boldest covert ventures abroad now will be 
plotting forays much nearer the white house as five men calling 
themselves the new pied pipers attempt to clean up their old 
neighborhoods in the capital 
north will most definitely be given a tour of the worst drug 
neighborhoods but he wont be active on the streets program 
coordinator donald lewis said tuesday hes not a streetwise 
individual we know that his element is administration 
north conscripted into the drug battle by the judge who 
sentenced him in the irancontra trial began his orientation 
monday as a management adviser to save our youth inc a private 
umbrella group for several antidrug projects he will focus to 
start with on the pipers initiative 
under an arrangement with the court north will work in the 
program about 16 hours a week for 75 weeks early last month us 
district judge gerhard a gesell sentenced north to two years 
probation a 150000 fine and 1200 hours of community service for 
his conviction on three felony counts in the irancontra case 
north is appealing his conviction but told the court he was 
eager to begin the community work 
north in a twohour getacquainted meeting with program 
organizers was very excited about his involvement coordinator 
donald lewis said tuesday he wanted to get to work right away 
north initially was scheduled to return to the programs offices 
at the national city christian church on tuesday afternoon but 
lewis said the second session was postponed to avoid the glare of 
media attention 
lewis said gesell assigned north to the save our youth program 
after the judge learned of the pipers effort the five men all 
wellknown in the drug community will try to dissuade youngsters 
from using drugs and also will seek out dealers in efforts to give 
them legal employment lewis said 
ronald roach henry a member of the pipers who met with 
north on monday said he has no qualms about working with the 
former white house aide hes interesting and i think he was 
interested in us said henry i think he will use his mind to 
help us develop solutions 
john staggers chairman of save our youth said north 
represents one of the best minds in the nation when it comes to 
strategizing on how to attack problems 
as a deputy on reagans national security council staff north 
not only was a key figure in the secret sale of arms to iran and 
diversion of profits to the nicaraguan rebels but played a major 
role in planning the invasion of grenada the retaliatory bombing 
of libya and the interception of an egyptian airliner carrying the 
hijackers of the achille lauro cruise ship 
staggers and lewis acknowledged that norths political image is 
a far cry from that favored by washingtons black community but 
were creating a marriage of two extremes said lewis 
the focus is not on our differences the focus is on changing 
what is happening on our streets and to our young people the young 
black man is selfdestructive hes becoming an endangered 
species lewis said 
under terms dictated by gesell north cannot act as a 
fundraiser cannot counsel young people and cannot give speeches 
or act as a spokesman for the group 
thus north will serve as a advisor in the management and 
administration of soys activities with his initial focus on the 
pipers lewis said he will stay in his element and well stay 
in ours

a federal grand jury wants to examine 
documents from at least three groups that bought hundreds of copies 
of a book by former house speaker jim wright instead of paying him 
a speaking fee the groups say 
the justice department refused tuesday to discuss the grand jury 
probe but lawyers for southwest texas state university and the 
national realtors association confirmed they received subpoenas 
requesting documents related to the book 
a spokesman for ocean spray a cranberry and citrus growers 
cooperative in massachusetts said the grand jury also was seeking 
documents from his group company spokesman john lawlor wouldnt 
discuss details of the subpoena but he did say the group bought 
2000 worth of wrights book for wrights use 
wright resigned this summer after the house ethics committee 
accused him of trying to evade house limits on outside income 
through bulk sales of reflections of a public man he earned 
royalties of 55 percent on the books sales 
the house limits members earnings from speaking engagements to 
30 percent of the congressional salary but royalties are exempt 
wright spokesman larry shannon said the investigation appeared 
to be very routine 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the agencys 
inquiry is continuing 
i cant comment on any aspect of the investigation except i 
will confirm that it is ongoing he said 
lawlor said wright spoke to ocean spray growers and management 
employees in november 1985 he said wrights staff suggested that 
instead of giving the house speaker an honorarium the cooperative 
could use the money to buy the books 
as far as we were concerned it was an honorarium in the form 
of a book purchase in place of a cash honorarium lawlor said 
how he was to use them the books was for him to determine 
bill fly a lawyer for southwest texas state university said 
the school received a subpoena for documents relating to wrights 
1984 speech there and the subsequent purchase of 3000 worth of 
books 
fly said the university had agreed to pay wright 3000 
however a wright aide called after the speech to say the speaker 
had reached his limit on outside income and asked if he could use 
the money to buy copies of his book for the university fly said 
we received about 504 copies of that book fly said 
laurene janik general counsel for the realtors organization 
said wright spoke to the group in april 1985 a 2000 check was 
issued and voided and the money was to be used to buy wrights 
book she said 
however the realtors have no record of receiving copies of the 
book ms janik said

president bush never one to sit still for 
long is traveling to his vacation home in maine next week by way 
of miami its a fairly common route jokes spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
bushs 2000 miles of backtracking en route to kennebunkport is 
a political detour that fitzwater says will be just one of many 
upcoming campaign appearances by the president 
in the florida instance its all in the family 
the president will campaign for ileana roslehtinen the 
republican nominee for the seat left vacant with the death in may 
of democratic rep claude pepper bushs son jeb a 36yearold 
miami real estate executive who has long been active in gop 
politics is the candidates campaign manager 
the presidents appearance comes in advance of an aug 29 
special election 
actually there has been considerable political maneuvering 
lately in bushs family both his official one and his personal 
one but most of the movement entails declarations of 
noncandidacies 
jeb bush for instance is sending out signals that hes not 
interested in running for elective office after a stint as 
floridas secretary of commerce preferring instead to spend time 
developing his business 
and bushs oldest son george w bush 43 an oilman and part 
owner of the texas rangers baseball team announced he was more 
interested in the american league pennant race than running for 
texas governor in 1990 
he had been widely viewed as a likely contender before last 
weeks announcement 
about the same time andrew h card jr deputy to white house 
chief of staff john sununu announced he is abandoning the notion 
of a gubernatorial bid in his home state of massachusetts and will 
devote his time to his white house post 
sununu earlier took himself out of the 1990 new hampshire race 
for the seat being vacated by the retiring sen gordon humphrey 
rnh he said he hopes to serve bush for at least four years 
preferably eight 
but speculation continues to swirl around persistent rumors that 
sununus wife nancy may challenge rep charles g douglas 
rnh next year the sununus and douglas have been on less than 
friendly terms recently 
meanwhile presidential aide steve studdert who has served 
three republican presidents announced recently that he was 
resigning to return home to utah spend more time with his family 
and serve as a political consultant 
and what about reports that he may run for governor of utah 
no plans at this time to run studdert says however he 
doesnt hesitate to note that there are major economic structural 
challenges that face utah and to outline how he would approach 
them 
bush meanwhile appears ready for his vacation which starts a 
week from today and will last until sept 5 
on monday night bush was preparing to speak via telephone 
hookup to a town meeting in fort lauderdale fla and was chatting 
with the local host rep clay shaw rfla about their travel 
plans 
the preliminary conversation was piped into the white house 
press briefing room and bush told shaw that first lady barbara 
bush was already in kennebunkport were going up next week 
the president said enthusiastically 
a case of the prevacation sillies may be setting at the white 
house 
bush the other day jokingly told a group of photographers in the 
oval office dont anybody take the ashtrays 
and on tuesday he rushed into the white house press room 
brandishing a gag photo depicting him as an invisible leader and 
jokingly threatened to fire the top aides who sent it to him as a 
practical joke 
the photo showed aides seated around bushs desk at the oval 
office with his seat empty it read to president skippy from 
the gang that sees through you 
it was a reference to the comic strip doonesbury and 
creator gb trudeaus frequent depiction of bush as invisible and 
references to an imaginary evil twin whom trudeau named skippy 
this is a vicious assault on my presidency bush said 
bush has made no secret that hes no fan of trudeau who was 
excluded from the invitation list when bush invited cartoonists to 
lunch last spring

americas sugar industry is stockpiling 
statistics to throw into the fight to maintain import quotas that 
ward off foreign sugar and boost consumer prices at home 
an industry study unveiled tuesday said the sugar and allied 
cornsweetener industries directly create 144442 fulltime jobs 
nationwide and pump almost 74 billion a year into the us 
economy 
it shows there is a lot more to this industry than the attacks 
that say it only benefits a handful of growers american sugar 
alliance chairman luther markwart said in making the study public 
markwart cited findings that counting indirect effects sugar 
and sweetener production generate 185 billion in wages and 
revenues plus 361000 jobs annually in 42 states 
if there is a move to lift quotas as part of the 1990 farm bill 
the survey is guaranteed to be used by the industry to offset 
claims that it represents only a narrow special interest 
because of the quotas a pound of raw sugar that sells for 14 
cents in world markets goes for about 24 cents in the united 
states that difference is passed on to consumers after the sugar 
is processed packaged and sent to the grocery shelf 
consumer groups and industries such as soft drink and candy 
makers complain about the high cost of us sugar the house and 
senate agriculture committees however have left the quotas 
intact the two panels include members from major sugargrowing 
states and lawmakers reap hefty campaign contributions from growers 
the survey also takes into account jobs and earnings generated 
by the cornsweetener industry its products used widely in soft 
drinks and various foods trail sugar in price and the two 
industries are often allies 
lifting quotas would eventually scuttle not only beet and cane 
growers but sweetener manufacturing in this country markwart said 
the survey said annual sugar and sweetener output totaling more 
than 73 billion a year is spread over many states it said that 
the combined value topped 100 million in 17 states 
the major corn states of iowa and illinois headed the list of 
17 those two states plus indiana tennessee and ohio were the 
leading cornsweetener producers major cane states were florida 
louisiana and hawaii new york made the list principally as a 
refining site 
also among the 17 were the sugarbeet producing states of 
minnesota california idaho north dakota nebraska michigan and 
colorado among states on the list texas was notable for its 
diversified production 
in employment the agricultural side of the two industries 
contributes 115268 jobs and the processing side 29173 according 
to the study 
it cited seven states with substantially higher employment 
totals than others florida 11057 california 10513 iowa 
9929 louisiana 9890 minnesota 9731 illinois 8907 and 
nebraska 8889 
the total includes farm workers involved in growing corn even 
though economists arent sure just what would happen to those jobs 
if sweetener production in the united states halted but the study 
said that leaving out corn production overall employment in the 
industries would total a highly creditable 75411 fulltime 
positions 
agricultural wages for corn and sugar totaled more than 12 
billion nationwide according to the study cane states had the 
highest overall payrolls 159 million for florida and 827 
million for louisiana 
on the processing side wages came to more than 811 million 
california led the way with 1185 million overall wages for 
growing and processing nationwide were just over 2 billion the 
survey said 
it said that sugar and sweetener business generates wages of 
100 million a year or more in eight states florida california 
iowa illinois louisiana hawaii minnesota and nebraska 
sugar industry critics are quick to point out not only the 
impact of quotas on the wallets of consumers but the other side of 
the employment story 
us workers also do not escape the adverse effects of this 
program sen bill bradley dnj told the senate recently 
bradley the programs leading senate critic noted that us 
refineries have been closing their doors and laying off workers 
because of high sugar prices he said those costs are also hurting 
other industries 
the us food and beverage manufacturing industries employ 
hundreds of thousands of people he said the chocolate and 
confectionary industries alone employ more than 60000 people 
these jobs are threatened by competition from foreign manufacturers 
who have access to sugar at world market prices not americas 
inflated price

farm machinery sales are expected to rise for 
the third year in a row increasing from 6 billion in 1988 to as 
much as 67 billion in 1989 according to the agriculture 
department 
higher net cash incomes lower real interest rates rising 
farmland values and lowered agricultural debt are all trends that 
are contributing to expectations for a better year in tractor 
sales usda said 
it said demand for the more powerful tractors is especially 
strong thus far in 1989 sales of 139plus horsepower twowheel 
drive and fourwheel drive tractors are expected to climb 23 
percent and 65 percent respectively

the department of housing and urban 
development says it cant locate the files of a former housing 
official whose conduct is under scrutiny in the influencepeddling 
probe but the former official says he doesnt have them 
i dont even know where they are kept much less take them 
with me thomas t demery said tuesday adding that he took no 
files when he left hud last year i dont have them 
james lafferty deputy assistant secretary for public affairs at 
hud said he may have taken them with him we dont have them 
here however he said the department has no evidence that demery 
took the files 
they could be someplace that we dont now know about but they 
are not in the typical places that you would look for them 
lafferty said 
hud officials realized the files were missing after receiving a 
freedom of information act request for access to them 
the files of two other former hud officials secretary samuel 
r pierce jr and his top aide deborah gore dean have provided 
dramatic insight into their activities at the agency 
pierce told congress in may that he had no direct role in 
funding decisions since then however a number of news accounts 
have detailed pierces personal intervention in several hud 
projects and his files offer further evidence that he was more 
involved in some decisions than he indicated in his congressional 
testimony 
ms deans files show that she was often contacted by developers 
and consultants seeking hud approval for projects and often gave 
proposals her endorsement although her job carried no official 
funding authority 
for two years demery was huds assistant secretary for housing 
a powerful position that has jurisdiction over many of huds 
subsidy programs 
the report that sparked the congressional and internal 
investigations of hud focused heavily on demerys conduct that 
report by huds inspector general questioned the selection 
process used to award lucrative rehabilitation subsidies and said 
many of those who benefited were contributors to a charity demery 
helped establish 
hud inspector general paul a adams concluded that demery 
committed no criminal offenses but said that prominent republicans 
and former agency officials appeared to get special treatment from 
hud 
the justice department which reviewed the report to determine 
whether demery violated huds standards of conduct said last month 
it would not prosecute him 
demery also was in charge of another program that was the 
subject of a critical audit by the inspector general 
that report said demery awarded emergency hud funding to a 
number of projects that werent eligible several qualified 
projects that didnt receive funding later went under and were 
taken over by the government the report said 
an associated press review of the program found that developers 
of projects that got emergency funding although auditors said they 
didnt qualify included a former business associate and several 
donors to his pet charity 
demery in a recent interview said he made the awards on the 
merits and questioned the audits assertion that many of the 
projects werent eligible

the national transportation safety board wants 
to find the best way to protect children who ride in small school 
buses that dont have to meet standards set for larger buses 
the board tuesday sent a report on school bus safety back to its 
staff for revisions after failing to resolve issues involving the 
use of seat belts and the design of frontseat barriers in buses 
that carry 10 to 24 passengers 
the staff wanted to conduct crash tests but the four board 
members at the meeting refused to adopt that recommendation 
acting chairman james kolstad said the small number of 
fatalities in small school buses an average of two or three a 
year with 41000 buses on the road didnt justify the testing 
i think the parents of this country can be reassured that 
their children are by and large safe on these small school buses 
kolstad said after the board spent three hours discussing the 
proposals it eventually declined to adopt 
the recommendations drawn from a study of 24 bus crashes 
called for tougher rollover standards improved joint design more 
secure door latches and strengthened windshields 
suzanne stack ntsb safety specialist said federal standards 
for seat spacing barrier padding and other safety features 
required for large buses dont apply to the smallest school buses 
use of the small buses has increased in urban areas where they 
often serve handicapped or specialized students she said 
kolstad said he hopes to call another board meeting within a few 
weeks to adopt the report and resolve the issues of frontseat 
barriers and lap belts 
kolstad characterized all the safety recommendations as 
relatively minor and said school buses remain one of the safest 
forms of transportation large buses are somewhat safer than small 
ones he said 
the report follows an ntsb study two years ago on larger school 
buses that concluded the vehicles generally are safe it 
recommended against installation of seat belts because federal 
standards require that seats be designed to form a padded 
compartment around young riders 
all small type a buses which include vans converted to carry 
pupils already have lap belts for each passenger but dont follow 
rules for compartmentalizing the youngsters 
the draft report recommended crash tests to determine the safety 
of various barrier designs with both restrained and unbelted 
passengers in type a buses barriers in front of the first row of 
seats in small school buses generally were inferior to those in 
large buses the report said 
in several cases studied the report said passengers were 
thrown into the front of the bus where they were injured in one 
instance two children sitting in a front seat were killed one 
who wore a lap belt rammed his head into the barrier and the other 
who was not wearing a belt was thrown through the barrier 
the report said restraining barriers sometimes came loose during 
crashes moving into the passenger area and exposing sharp edges 
that caused injuries 
the draft also called for a study of the possibility of 
requiring lapshoulder belts or other restraining systems for all 
passengers in type a buses 
board member jim burnett who was not at the meeting said he 
favored adopting the staff report as drafted 
in a telephone interview burnett said that although school 
buses provide a highly safe form of transportation the security 
of schoolchildren remains a major public safety concern

the decade began with their creation and if 
all goes according to plan it will end with their demobilization 
as the clock runs out on the nicaraguan contras they have fallen 
short of achieving their principal goal but can still point to some 
successes 
the bush administration tried tuesday to put the best face on a 
central american plan to dismantle the contras by dec 5 pointing 
out the rebels are under no obligation to do anything unless 
safe democratic conditions are established in nicaragua 
permitting their voluntary return 
the administration would have much preferred that the contras 
stay together in their camps along the honduran border until after 
the feb 25 1990 elections serving as an incentive for the 
sandinistas to carry out a fair election process in the interim 
but even if the contras manage to survive their dec 8 death 
sentence there is almost no possibility they will ever again be a 
major factor shaping the destiny of their homeland or of central 
america itself 
not much has gone right for them since president reagan signed 
legislation in october 1986 providing the contras 100 million in 
economic and military aid 
less than a month later the irancontra scandal claimed two of 
their most ardent backers in the administration lt col oliver 
north and national security adviser john poindexter another 
setback occurred with the death in early 1987 of another stalwart 
supporter cia director william casey 
in august 1987 the central american peace agreement was signed 
requiring the united states to end its support for the contras 
this considerably strengthened the hand of the anticontra bloc in 
the congress 
in february 1988 the house rejected an administration request 
for additional aid for the contras soon after an informal 
ceasefire was agreed to in nicaragua and the contra exodus to the 
base camps in honduras began 
since then there has been no serious discussion of resuming aid 
to the contras secretary of state james a baker iii made clear 
his sentiments last march when he declared the reagan 
administrations policy toward the contras a failure 
the contras are feeling even more abandoned following the 
central american summit earlier this week in honduras the meeting 
was preceded by an agreement by president daniel ortega and 
nicaraguas internal opposition declaring that the time had come 
for the contras to go home in peace 
previously the contras and opposition parties enjoyed an 
informal alliance viewing each other as partners in their quest to 
remove the sandinistas from power 
the oppositions disassociation from the contras made it easier 
for the central american presidents to set their december timetable 
for the rebels demobilization appeals from the bush 
administration for a less ambitious deadline were ignored 
the rebels are now reduced to ragtag status in the border camps 
and their remaining backers in washington are reduced to no more 
than a diehard few here and there 
but there are those who recall with nostalgia the contras 
heyday and with trepidation the whatmighthavebeens in central 
america one former reagan administration official insists the 
contras made more of a contribution to us interests than baker 
and other critics give them credit for 
they were such a nuisance that the sandinistas had to forgo 
efforts to carry out subversion elsewhere in central america 
enabling these countries to get a start on establishing democratic 
systems all still have elected presidents 
it was primarily because of the contra military threat that the 
sandinistas agreed to sign the 1987 peace agreement in guatemala 
at that meeting the sandinistas won support from other governments 
in the region for an end to us aid to the contras but also made 
unprecedented commitments to bring democracy to nicaragua 
although the sandinista performance in carrying out these 
commitments has not been perfect the country has not turned into 
what the reagan administration feared most an expansionist 
totalitarian oneparty state modeled after cuba

president bushs rhetoric is right on 
civil rights say national urban league leaders but they plan to 
wait a year to see how it turns out in practice 
i am willing to concede that the first six to eight months is 
the rhetoric period in judging a new administration urban league 
president john e jacob said after bushs address tuesday 
we will use the next 12 months to determine how well he does 
in carrying that out his rhetoric is right he is saying the right 
things now we have to find out whether he is willing to do the 
right things jacob said 
joseph e lowery president of the southern christian leadership 
conference was scheduled to address the concluding session of the 
conference today 
bush the first president to address an urban league conference 
since president carter in 1979 received generous applause as he 
pledged that his administration will not tolerate discrimination 
bigotry or bias of any kind 
but joan n tokley president of the tampa fla urban league 
said i would have felt a lot more comfortable if the president 
had addressed the recent rulings of the supreme court especially 
those that deal with affirmative action 
recent decisions of the court have held that state and local 
governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public works 
hiring that minorities must meet higher statistical standards to 
prove they are being relegated to less desirable jobs and that 
white workers not involved in an 8yearold affirmative action 
ruling were nevertheless entitled to attack it in court 
no matter what he says his moral and philosophical conviction 
is at this point i havent heard him say anything about the 
laws in this country that were designed to protect blacks women 
and other minorities ms tokley said and until he does i 
will not be convinced that he actually means what he says 
harold hood a michigan court of appeals judge attending the 
conference said bushs address was a very neutral talk as far as 
minorities were concerned 
i dont know that i expect him to be on our side hood said 
id be happy if he isnt against us and at least i didnt get 
the sense that hes against us and thats a plus 
bush told the delegates the gulf between white and black america 
has narrowed but has not been closed 
closing that gulf eliminating it for all time is the next 
chapter we must write in the unfolding history the unfinished 
history of civil rights bush said 
he conceded that he and civil rights leaders have disagreed 
about how to accomplish that 
weve argued societys argued about affirmative action 
about quotas goals and timetables about setasides he said 
but the most important point the president said is that 
bigotry and bias may take more subtle forms than in the past 
but they persist and as long as they do our work is not over

into homelessness by a mild recession in the us economy 
according to a study 
the report by the american affordable housing institute said

uncoordinated and are conducted by officials often unaware of the 
resources available to them

university in new brunswick nj estimated that there are 4 
million to 14 million american families living on the knife edge 
of homelessness who could face life on the streets should a mild

streets the report said in a mild recession homelessness in 
america is likely to double and triple almost overnight

turmoil in china means the government there 
will have a difficult time dealing with inflation and other 
economic problems the cia has concluded 
economic reform has been put on hold by the central government 
and economic problems could prompt renewed political unrest in the 
1990s said the report to the joint economic committee released 
tuesday 
the new leadership has endorsed a continuation of the 
austerity program but the social and political turmoil that has 
gripped china since april will make it difficult for beijing to 
solve its pressing economic problems the report said 
inflation in 1989 hit 19 percent overall and 30 percent in urban 
areas the highest levels since the communists came to power in 
1949 
the cia authors also said chinas military leaders probably will 
play a larger political and economic role in return for the 
military crackdown last may on democracy demonstrations in beijing

the songs sound better the second time around in 
the broadway revival of shenandoah and john cullum returning 
in the starring role is just as good as he was when he won a 1975 
tony award 
the homespun antiwar musical opened tuesday at the virginia 
theater with a cast boasting a larger percentage of very good 
voices than most broadway musicals 
cullums fine voice isnt as effortless as it once was but the 
september that has entered it improves his ability to convey the 
widower charlie andersons deep love for his family 
shenandoah originally opened jan 7 1975 at broadways 
alvin theater and ran for 1050 performances the revival which 
first played in toronto is scheduled through sept 2 with an 
extension considered 
the story is based on the 1965 movie of the same name which 
starred james stewart it tells of a father six sons daughter and 
daughterinlaw who live and farm together in the shenandoah valley 
of virginia during the civil war 
undertakers are the only winners in a war anderson believes 
and he keeps his family neutral but the war wont leave them alone 
a corny moment as anderson tells his prospective soninlaw 
that women sometimes get angry when husbands dont do things the 
women havent asked them to do is bearable because its comic 
relief against tragedies the audience knows must come in act 2 
shenandoah is sentimental too but focusing on individuals in 
one family makes the sentiment meaningful not shallow 
the songs are a cross between the wholesome rodgers and 
hammerstein style and ballads written for somebody like tony 
bennett theres an anthem freedom a lullaby papas gonna 
make it alright the uptempo next to lovin i like 
fightin for the five grown sons and the only home i know 
an irishsounding tune sung by irish tenor stephen simms 
tracey moore was the daughter of the house displaying a voice 
that would fit perfectly in me and my girl other principals 
were camilla scott the daughterinlaw burke lawrence 
christopher martin nigel hamer stephen mcintyre and robin blake 
the grown sons jason zimbler the young son roy mckay his slave 
friend and thomas cavanagh the soninlaw

the opposition imposed an embarrassing delay 
wednesday in parliaments confirmation of toshiki kaifu as japans 
second new prime minister in a little over two months 
kaifu who was elected tuesday to head the governing liberal 
democratic party was approved by the more powerful lower house 
but the senate then voted for japan socialist party chairwoman 
takako doi 
it was the first time in 41 years that the two houses disagreed 
on who should take power 
delegates from the two chambers were to meet in conference later 
in the day to go through the motions of finding a compromise if 
they fail as expected under the constitution the lower house 
victor prevails 
kaifu 58 called the delay a severe consequence of our 
election defeat 
kaifu is succeeding sousuke uno who decided to step down after 
the liberal democrats were thrashed in the july 23 election for 
half the seats in the upper house of the diet japans parliament 
the party lost its majority in the senate for the first time 
since it was formed in 1955 but still commands the lower house 
meanwhile unos cabinet met and resigned en masse clearing the 
way for kaifu to form a new government to try to win back the 
public approval that the liberal democrats have lost in a 
succession of scandals and unpopular policies 
on tuesday kaifu pledged to restore public trust after a year 
of scandal and unpopular policies that caused voters to turn on the 
governing party for the first time since it was formed 
i am painfully aware of the weight of my responsibility 
kaifu told a news conference tuesday we have been reborn and we 
must forge ahead we must carry out political reforms and shed our 
old skin 
a secret ballot of liberal democratic members of parliament and 
statelevel party leaders resulted in 279 votes for kaifu 120 for 
former welfare minister yoshiro hayashi and 48 for shintaro 
ishihara a novelist and former transport minister 
the upper house elections cost the liberal democrats their 
majority for the first time since the party was formed in 1955 
general elections for the more powerful lower house must be called 
by next july 
on tuesday night kaifu met with other party officials to decide 
on a new cabinet and party leadership a delicate task of balancing 
key jobs among rival party factions in the party 
he succeeds sousuke uno who was plagued by reports that he kept 
paid mistresses uno resigned to take responsibility for the loss 
of the upper house elections attributed to the sex and money 
scandals and a 3 percent sales tax that outraged housewives 
uno had replaced noboru takeshita who stepped down june 2 to 
take responsibility for the recruit co influencebuying scandal 
which reached the top levels of politics business and the 
bureaucracy 
takeshita chose uno one of the few ranking politicians 
untouched by the recruit scandal as his successor but kaifu was 
selected by the first party election in 17 years 
despite the election many still see kaifus candidacy as a 
product of backroom politics he has no personal power base and is 
viewed as unlikely to stand in the way of more senior leaders 
temporarily blocked from the prime ministry by the recruit scandal 
how long kaifu will serve is not clear his term as party 
president is only three months until the end of takeshitas 
original term but he could be elected to another 
before tuesdays vote candidate hayashi said i read in the 
newspaper this morning that the election was already decided the 
liberal democratic party presidential election is not subject to 
the public election law but if it were it would be violating the 
rules 
opposition parties accused the liberal democrats of continuing 
politics in the old style 
as always it was secret factional politics said ms doi of 
the japan socialist party which made the greatest gains in the 
upper house elections there is simply no change its just what 
has been done all along theyre changing a books cover without 
changing its contents 
an editorial in the newspaper asahi said maneuvering within the 
party blatantly reflects a design to sustain a system of 
leadership monopolized by the mainstream factions 
the starting point for kaifu is to grapple with the issues 
that were brought to light in the presidential election and to 
change what should be changed it said otherwise his election 
by vote will prove to be a farce 
in pledging to change the system kaifu told the news conference 
tuesday in various ways factions have had an evil influence 
but just saying that they are bad wont make them go away 
kaifu lacks experience in foreign and financial affairs does 
not lead his own faction and has never served in a top party post 
he was the youngest member of parliament when elected at age 29 
and predicted at the time he would become prime minister in another 
29 years

consumers have had it with commercials on the 
videocassettes they rent even as more car and softdrink spots are 
being spliced onto movie tapes 
sixtysix percent of vcr owners said they fastforward through 
commercials at the beginning of rented movies according to a 
nielsen media research study released tuesday at the eighth annual 
video software dealers association convention 
the study further found that more than 60 percent of those 
surveyed said they zip through coming attractions 
despite the renters unhappiness though the commercials wont 
be going away anytime soon 
mca home videos upcoming release of the land before time 
will carry a pizza hut pitch 
rain man features a buick plug a fish called wanda 
hypes schweppes and young guns hawks nestle 
and a number of promoters have created a ruckus at this years 
convention by offering to open prerecorded cassettes and attach 
commercials for local merchants 
video air time of midland texas will put spots for florists 
bowling alleys attorneys and department stores on any cassette 
where theres room 
were offering the video store owner an additional source of 
revenue said terry mathis video air times vice president for 
franchising the video store owns the cassette and if we dont 
make an unauthorized infringement of the copyrighted material we 
have violated no law 
video air time charges about 20 per commercial per cassette of 
which the store owner receives about 1 a tape 
paramount pictures has filed a 1 million lawsuit against st 
louisbased video broadcasting systems alleging that the company 
has placed commercials on beverly hills cop ii raiders of 
the lost ark and eddie murphy raw in some markets 
paramount argues that lowbudget local commercials damage the 
studios image paramount was the first studio to place a 
commercial on a major studio release adding a diet pepsi pitch to 
top gun in 1986 
like that slick spot many commercials on major studio releases 
are wellproduced often superior to spots for the same product 
running on television 
the disapproval rate reflected in the new nielsen study comes as 
a major reversal from a nielsen study released in april that 
survey showed that 95 percent of households renting the a fish 
called wanda video watched the schweppes commercial 
some home video executives have predicted that more than half of 
all video releases will contain commercials in the near future 
besides its findings on fastforwarding commercials the new 
nielsen study showed that although video rental volume continues to 
grow customers are looking for other ways to spend time including 
other leisure activities business or education or regular 
television 
the nielsen inquiry also found that renters by a wide majority 
dont want to pay higher rental fees for newer films

an antiabortion candidate held a 
narrow lead tuesday among republicans in the first state election 
since the us supreme courts ruling giving states more authority 
to limit abortions 
with 29 percent of the precincts reporting richard lyles 42 
of poway was leading with 6140 votes to 5129 for gop rival tricia 
hunter 36 of bonita the only prochoice republican on the ballot 
in the heavily gop district in san diego and riverside counties 
jeannine correia an instructor for the developmentally disabled 
from poway was leading the democrats in early returns with 1508 
votes to 729 for stephen thorne 34 of escondido 
due largely to the abortion issue the unusual special election 
to fill an empty assembly seat managed to overcome the summer 
doldrums 
voters in the 76th assembly district in northeast san diego 
county and southwest riverside county were picking a successor to 
gop assemblyman bill bradley who died of cancer june 1 
the likely outcome was that one of the six republicans and one 
of the two democrats would meet in a runoff general election on 
oct 3 when the republican would be the huge favorite in the 
gopdominated district 
one candidate would have to win more than 50 percent of the vote 
in tuesdays special primary to win the seat outright 
the other republican candidates were linda brannon 42 of 
poway ray foster 69 of spring valley bill hoover 45 of 
escondido and dennis koolhaas 34 of escondido 
although major local issues include crime taxes and population 
growth national attention has focused on the abortion question 
both prochoice and antiabortion advocates say the election is the 
first for a state office since the high courts july 3 ruling in 
the webster case 
the only prochoice republican is hunter a registered nurse who 
is director of surgical services at chula vista community hospital 
and president of the state board of registered nursing 
the democrats thorne a san diego county mental health worker 
and correia are also prochoice 
lyles a management consultant hoover a san diego police 
lieutenant and foster a retired appliance store owner are 
strongly antiabortion and opposed to state funding of medical 
abortions koolhaas an aide to state sen bill craven and 
brannon a poway city council member and deputy mayor also oppose 
state funding but tend to sidestep questions on the legality of 
abortions

the soviets were listening and 
journalists had reported for weeks on columbias payload so why 
did military and nasa officials go to the trouble of keeping the 
launch time and other details secret 
by being inexact about the launch time it complicates their 
ability to track lt col ron rand air force spokesman said of 
the soviets they may or may not listen in but were going to do 
everything we can to keep the payload anonymous 
but scientists who attended tuesdays launch of the defense 
departments fourth shuttle mission said the military shroud wont 
stop the soviets from finding out all about the reconnaissance 
satellite columbia and its five astronauts are believed to be 
launching 
theres no reason i can think of for the secrecy said john 
pike a space analyst with the federation of american scientists 
in principle they could run this countdown like they run every 
countdown maybe this way its more fun for them 
the soviets will shoot pictures of the satellite even before the 
device begins functioning said pike soviet cameras attached to a 
telescope can give a resolution as small as one foot 
if they launch the satellite this morning the soviets will 
certainly know what it looks like by tonight he said tuesday 
nasa lifted its news blackout only briefly announcing the 
launch time nine minutes before blastoff and reporting a 
troublefree ascent into orbit shortly afterward 
nevertheless a soviet trawler bristling with antennas monitored 
the launch from less than 50 miles off cape canaveral reporters 
and probably the soviets listened in on national aeronautics and 
space administrations internal communications channel to follow 
the countdown 
the soviet trawler and anyone else with a radar system could 
track columbia as soon as it left the launch pad but nasa refused 
to tell reporters where the solid rocket boosters fell saying that 
could help determine the shuttles trajectory 
the military clampdown on the mission wasnt airtight though 
the shuttle crew which always boards about 2 hours before the 
scheduled launch time was trucked out to the pad in the early 
morning illuminated by a spotlight and accompanied by a helicopter 
escort as wellwishers waved and camera crews filmed 
inside the kennedy space center media room space experts 
generally agreed the 20600pound satellite would spy on the soviet 
union with highly sensitive camera lenses and infrared sensors from 
300 miles up 
if its a high inclination on takeoff its going over 
russia and its going to do some kind of sensing said harry 
kolcum of the magazine aviation week amp space technology which 
often gives details of secret satellites prior to launch 
indeed the shuttle took off on a northnortheast course that 
would take it over poland the soviet union mongolia china and 
parts of the middle east nonmilitary shuttle missions normally 
take an eastward path 
besides tracking columbias launch the soviets will be able to 
intercept the satellites emissions kolcum said 
the experts also agreed columbia carried a second small payload 
a 275pound instrument package apparently intended for use in the 
strategic defense initiative program according to aviation week 
weve been after them for years to change theres no reason 
we can think of for keeping it secret kolcum said 
although nasa would like shuttle flights to get the maximum 
amount of publicity the agency must please the air force which 
has switched some of its launches to unmanned rockets in the wake 
of the challenger disaster 
if secrecys judged by them to be in the nations interest 
im for it said jr thompson deputy administrator of nasa 
the defense departments gag on the mission may irk journalists 
and some nasa supporters but the soviets appear to empathize with 
the secrecy 
asked about the launch of a spy satellite over his territory a 
soviet embassy press spokesman in washington said only we dont 
comment on such matters

a quebec woman defied a court order obtained by 
her former boyfriend and had an abortion but the supreme court 
voted unanimously to lift the restriction anyway 
the case of chantal daigle 21 was the latest and most dramatic 
in a series this summer that brought attention to canadas lack of 
a federal abortion law 
in ruling tuesday the supreme court said it would give its 
reasons later for lifting the injunction obtained july 7 by ms 
daigles exboyfriend 25yearold jeanguy tremblay tremblay a 
former nightclub bouncer and ms daigle briefly lived together in 
montreal before breaking up 
the courts nine justices had returned from vacation for an 
emergency session in ottawa tuesday believing that ms daigle was 
entering the 23rd week of pregnancy and could not wait much longer 
for the case to be resolved 
her lawyer daniel bedard who evidently had been unaware that 
ms daigle went ahead with the abortion told the court about it in 
the middle of the session 
the attorney general of quebec informed me they suspected my 
client of having proceeded to have an abortion bedard said i 
have checked this and it is true 
bedard did not say when or where his client had the abortion 
he apologized to the court but asked for the case to be heard 
because ms daigle a secretary still could face contempt charges 
that carry a twoyear prison term and 42500 fine 
tremblay also heard the news in court and told reporters she 
just killed my child i dont know when today or last week 
a spokesman for quebec justice minister gil remillard said 
police called his office tuesday with details of the abortion from 
an informer 
remillard said there were good reasons to believe that madame 
daigle had an abortion a week ago but he declined to say where 
i dont think its opportune to talk about that he said 
most doctors in quebec will not perform abortions after the 20th 
week abortions are peformed in some parts of the united states 
until the 24th week and she hinted after an appeals court upheld 
the injunction on july 26 that she might cross the border for the 
procedure 
she said later however that she would abide by the supreme 
courts ruling 
in fighting the injunction she said tremblay had abused her 
and one time threw her to the ground and told her he would 
control and subdue her 
one of her lawyers robert decary said the question of whether 
she still would be subject to contempt of court charges will not be 
answered until the supreme court gives its reasons for overturning 
the injunction 
about 350 antiabortion demonstrators maintained a vigil outside 
the supreme court during the hearing 
i am pretty appalled by the whole thing that she went out 
and killed her baby said jim hughes president of the campaign 
life coalition 
judy rebick spokeswoman for the national action committee on 
the status of women which supports the right to abortion said 
chantal has been through the most incredible pressure she 
clearly wanted to obey the law 
but i cant imagine what it must have been like to know that 
the clock was ticking in terms of the deadline on that abortion 
clayton ruby a toronto lawyer said the ruling has likely put 
an end to the use of injunctions to prevent women from getting 
abortions in quebec and perhaps other parts of canada 
no more injunctions in quebec from vindictive boyfriends 
said ruby represents the canadian abortion rights action league 
canada has been without an abortion law since the supreme court 
ruled in january 1988 that the existing laws stringent 
requirements for approval of an abortion infringed on a womans 
rights the house of commons failed to approve any of six proposed 
laws in july 1988 
the outcome was that abortion was left a matter between a woman 
and her doctor 
last month however that premise was challenged by three 
provincial court cases including ms daigles 
the ontario supreme court threw out an injunction obtained by a 
man claiming a fathers right and the woman went ahead with the 
abortion in manitoba a woman went ahead with the procedure after 
her former boyfriend failed to obtain an injunction 
prime minister brian mulroney has said parliament will tackle 
the abortion issue this fall when it returns from its recess but 
will not be rushed into a decision 
the federal government argued before the supreme court that 
abortion is within the exclusive legislative authority of the 
parliament of canada and should not be a matter for provincial 
courts to decide 
the court ruling came in response to quebecs court of appeal 
which voted 32 to uphold an injunction issued by quebec superior 
court 
the appeals court based its decision on the provinces charter 
of human rights justice yves bernier wrote in the majority 
position that the child that has been conceived but not born is a 
reality that must be taken into account

pittsburgh police have declared victory over 
jaywalking and have quietly halted their crackdown on wayward 
pedestrians 
cmdr edward patterson said officers issued about 600 written 
warnings to jaywalkers downtown and in the citys squirrel hill and 
oakland neighborhoods since january when public safety director 
glenn cannon promised to go after those illegally crossing city 
streets 
patterson said officers stopped issuing written warnings a 
couple of months ago and no one was fined 3250 for jaywalking 
but he said the effort was very successful because it made 
pedestrians more aware of the dangers of jaywalking 
he said pedestrians now are less likely to jaywalk in front of 
police officers

the withdrawal of his sole opponent leaves the 
way clear for former mayor maynard jackson to return to city hall 
for a third term 
michael lomax chairman of the fulton county commission 
withdrew from the mayoral election tuesday after polls showed he 
was far behind that left the 51yearold jackson who served two 
fouryear terms beginning in 1974 with no opposition 
lomax 41 who trailed by 34 percentage points in the polls 
said he was stepping aside to ensure this campaign does not 
divide our citys family 
he might have been able to win lomax said by hitting harder on 
crime but the real casualty of that attack would have been 
the city it would have been too costly a victory 
the rate of 176 crimes per 1000 residents in this city of 
445000 is the nations worst according to fbi statistics released 
monday 
there are no other candidates and if one announced there 
wouldnt be enough time before the oct 3 election to mount a 
credible campaign said atlanta pollster claibourne darden 
theres no time no body and no money darden said youve 
got three nos 
city councilman hosea williams hinted he might run simply to 
give jackson some opposition it would be a tragedy to see 
maynard jackson walk into city hall he ought to be challenged 
williams said 
jackson like lomax a black democrat had cemented his populist 
appeal among the black majority with growing support from white 
businessmen lomax ran as the more businessoriented candidate but 
failed to broaden his support 
during his terms jackson had often battled with businessmen 
who have gotten along well with outgoing mayor andrew young 
there has been a change in attitudes and a lot of the old 
guard is gone said angelo fuster jacksons press secretary 
darden said the lomax ads in which he tried to link jackson 
with atlantas crime rate probably had little impact and forced 
lomax to drain his coffers 
he took that highrisk technique of viciously attacking his 
opponent and he found out why its a highrisk strategy it 
doesnt work most of the time darden said thats the most 
important thing hes broke 
jackson whose campaign featured a pledge not to allow a 
building boom to overrun neighborhoods said the negative ads had 
very little effect on me 
lomaxs withdrawal allows him to keep his job as commission 
chairman which he would have been forced to give up by the aug 16 
qualifying deadline 
fulton county includes about 90 percent of atlantas population 
which is 61 percent black 
young who cannot seek a third consecutive term said lomaxs 
decision to pull out probably relieves a lot of friends of both 
of them 
williams claimed that lomax who worked for jackson in his 
previous administrations always intended to drop out to prevent a 
candidate from running who was unacceptable to the black 
middleclass power structure 
i have said from the beginning maynard and lomax would never 
face each other this was only a political drama williams said

the us dollar slipped modestly against the 
japanese yen wednesday while the key index on the tokyo stock 
exchange firmed 
the dollar closed at 13885 yen down 040 yen from tuesdays 
close of 13925 yen it opened at 13872 yen and ranged between 
1384013900 yen 
the nikkei stock average for 225 selected issues gained 9979 
points or 029 percent closing at 3485927 on tuesday the 
index climbed 12910 points 
daiwa bank trader shinzo yamamoto said majority of market 
players expect the dollar to move lower and were reluctant to make 
major moves ahead of the release of the us producer price index 
for july scheduled for friday 
the dollaryen rate is expected to back to the rate before the 
unemployment rate release last friday he said earlier last 
week the dollar was moving in the 135136 yen range but it went up 
after the lowerthanexpected us jobless rate reported friday 
yamamoto said investors in newly issued us government bonds 
were buying the dollar to facilitate their purchases 
on the stock market dealers attributed the indexs rise largely 
to the yens upswing against the dollar and gains on overseas stock 
market during their trading overnight 
the indexs gain was inspired by rises in housing issues said a 
dealer with a major securities firm speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the dealer said housing issues attracted participants by 
prospects that housing improvement will be a major policy in the 
new government that is to be led by legislator toshiki kaifu 
kaifu was elected chairman of the governing liberal democratic 
party tuesday to succeed sousuke uno who has resigned to take 
responsibility for the partys loss in the july 23 election for the 
upper house of parliament 
kaifu is expected to be named the new prime minister later 
wednesday after approval by the lower house of the parliament

an ariane rocket blasted into orbit 
from this south american space center carrying one satellite to map 
the position of stars and another for west german television 
the ariane 4 rocket lifted off tuesday following a brief halt in 
the countdown seven seconds before launching so technicians could 
check out a problem in the rockets guidance system 
the launching followed the us space shuttle columbias 
successful liftoff earlier in the day little is known about the 
us mission because its mission was to launch a spy satellite 
it was the fifth us shuttle flight since september when 
flights resumed following the 1986 challenger disaster in which 
seven astronauts died 
the ariane program also experienced a break of some months 
following the failure of its 18th mission launches were resumed 
sept 16 1987 
ariane 4s mission is the 33rd by arianespace a partnership of 
11 european countries and the world leader in the lucrative 
commercial launch field 
ariane 4 first flown june 15 1988 is the latest version of 
the reliable rocket series developed under the aegis of the 
european space agency the rocket has six possible configurations 
tailored to individual payloads and is capable of carrying 4190 
pounds to 9260 pounds into orbit 
tuesdays mission will carry a payload of 7186 pounds into 
geostationary orbit including the satellite hipparcos a european 
space agency mission dedicated to the precise measurement of the 
positions and motions of the stars 
the second satellite is the tvsat2 for the west german 
bundespost telecommunications authority the direct broadcasting 
satellite is to replace tvsat1 which was abandoned in november 
1987 after a failure in the deployment mechanism of its solar array 
arianespace which has international orders for 74 launches 
worth 23 billion plans to send a rocket into space once a month 
between october and january about 47 percent of the orders are for 
european projects and the rest are for clients outside europe 
according to arianespace

a priest blessed four sixthcentury mosaics 
in a basement vault where they will stay while an art collector 
appeals a court ruling giving the greek orthodox church possession 
of the rare byzantine works 
the rev james rousakis pastor of holy trinity greek orthodox 
church in indianapolis read from a prayer book and sang in greek 
over the artworks lying on the basement vaults floor tuesday 
he sprinkled them with holy water then he and michael 
kyprianou senior counsel for the republic of cyprus knelt and 
kissed each one 
in the orthodox faith the mosaics are sacred a consecrated 
form of art that is part and parcel of our worship service once 
they are removed its almost as if theyre stained or tainted 
they have to be restored rousakis said 
us district judge james e noland ruled thursday that art 
dealer peg goldberg of suburban carmel had not obtained legal title 
to the mosaics when she purchased them for 12 million last summer 
in switzerland from aydin dikmen a turk living in west germany 
the republic of cyprus and the church sued ms goldberg last 
spring to recover the works which had been stripped from a church 
in turkishoccupied northern cyprus in 1979 
noland ordered the mosaics returned to the cypriots attorneys 
for both sides agreed tuesday the artworks would be turned over to 
the cypriots but must remain in the indianapolis vault pending 
appeals they may be removed only under a court order or agreement 
by both sides 
today is a great day for cyprus said kyprianou years of 
hard work in securing our artifacts our cultural heritage have 
not been wasted 
tuesdays prayers included one of forgiveness for goldberg and 
those who took the mosaics from the church and smuggled them out of 
the mediterranean island nation 
we have learned to forgive people kyprianou said what we 
wanted are our mosaics back 
the mosaics pieced together with painted glass about 525 ad 
are fragments of a much larger work on the ceiling of a church in 
northern cyprus the images of jesus as a boy the apostles james 
and matthew and an archangel are among only a handful of icons 
surviving the first centuries of christianity 
under tuesdays agreement cyprus controls the keys to the vault 
but will not move the mosaics or restore them during the appeals 
process unless goldberg agrees 
she must file an appeal of nolands decision within 14 days and 
must not seek delays during the appeals process 
we very strongly intend to appeal i just simply totally 
disagree with the decision ms goldberg said

an earthquake that broke windows and 
contributed to one death in the san francisco bay area could herald 
even stronger temblors along the san andreas fault scientists say 
the stress is building up in the earth and were going to 
start getting large earthquakes said andy michael a 
geophysicist with the us geological survey in menlo park it 
should serve as a reminder to prepare 
the quake rolled for 10 seconds shaking buildings and awakening 
residents but causing only minor damage authorities said 
i thought all my windows were going to break said margaret 
dunlap of san francisco my whole bed was shaking 
it struck at 113 am about 50 miles south of san francisco and 
had a magnitude of 52 on the richter scale according to the us 
geological survey it was centered on the san andreas fault about 
15 miles south of san jose 
state earthquake experts and the california office of emergency 
services issued a warning of increased risk and said another quake 
as high as 62 on the richter scale could strike san francisco in 
the next five days 
it certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active 
said michael who added that the quake was the largest in the area 
since 1969 
geologists said the chances of a bigger quake in the same spot 
diminished with each passing hour however 
the quake occurred as state and federal emergency services 
officials prepared to conduct a twoday test of their response to a 
catastrophic earthquake 
marilyn quayle wife of vice president dan quayle was in 
sacramento to attend the first day of the test when she woke up at 
530 am and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television 
she thought it was part of the exercise 
i thought gee this is pretty interesting they have the 
simulation on television already quayle said 
in los gatos where the quake was centered police reported that 
19yearold matthew james bignall jumped from his bedroom window 
after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake 
bignall died of multiple traumatic injuries according to a 
spokeswoman with the santa clara county coroners office his 
halfbrother said bignall had never experienced an earthquake 
my brother was a sound sleeper said ronald burger who 
shared the apartment with bignall and i think the motion of the 
quake seemed so violent and disorienting that he just leaped out 
the window he felt he had to get out and i dont think he knew 
what he was doing 
residents reported some broken windows and items falling off 
shelves but no major problems a los gatos police dispatcher said 
damage was confined mostly to santa clara and northern santa cruz 
counties according to the state office of emergency services in 
sacramento 
the quake was felt as far away as san luis obispo about 230 
miles south of san francisco residents of sonoma county 60 miles 
to the north also felt the temblor according to the state agency 
a moderate aftershock measuring 42 on the richter scale struck 
at 144 am followed by a second stronger aftershock that 
measured 45 at 853 am the usgs said 
the openended richter scale is a measure of ground motion 
recorded on a seismograph each increase of one number means a 
tenfold increase in ground motion 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the scale

a police officer could have stopped the rape of a 
suspected prostitute without blowing his cover in a drug 
investigation representatives of two womens organizations said 
it doesnt take a police badge to stop a rape said karen 
ashmore president of the dallas chapter of the national 
organization for women which has called for the firing of officer 
tomas echartea i certainly would not be comfortable with a 
police officer watching over my security and welfare who let a rape 
happen 
she said the organization will formally ask groesbeck police 
chief chuck walker to fire echartea who said he pretended to be 
sick while three men he was investigating on drug charges raped the 
woman 
walker who has defended echarteas nonaction did not return 
phone calls tuesday to the associated press 
wanda white a counselor at the rape crisis center in dallas 
said echarteas failure to do something was a crime in itself 
if a crime is being committed somebody should do something 
about it thats a decision all of us have to make ms white 
said 
you dont want to ruin your credibility echartea told the 
dallas morning news if it had been a lifethreatening situation 
id have blown my cover id have had to you just cant let 
someone be killed 
echartea said he included the rape in that days report to his 
superiors the officer who took the report could not be reached for 
comment 
dallas police said they will begin a criminal investigation and 
try to find the woman and ask if she wants to press charges 
detectives will also ask echartea for a full account of what 
happened dallas deputy chief ray hawkins said 
i think he had some obligation as one human being to another 
to help her as best he could hawkins said all women even 
prostitutes have a right not to be raped 
echarteas investigation resulted in the arrests of four people 
on charges of selling drugs he is an officer on the police force 
of groesbeck 85 miles south of dallas 
dallas county district attorney john vance said he did not know 
whether state law requires texas police to intervene in felonies 
they observe 
echartea first recounted the incident publicly in an interview

parents who fail to rein in their kids 
could be displayed in a public stockade under a city law that also 
sets a curfew for teenagers 
until we introduce shame back in crime and punishment were 
spinning our wheels city attorney charles sidney gibson said 
the ordinance approved unanimously by the city council on monday 
was in response to a street fight saturday night and an overall 
increase in crime during the summer in dermott a town of about 
5000 people 
the fight involved about six youths and adults and drew some 
250 onlookers police chief jerry melton said 
the ordinance calls for delinquent parents to be fined up to 
500 and jailed up to 30 days within stockaded public display 
six hours a day during certain days of the sentence 
gibson said he was unsure about the constitutionality of using a 
stockade mayor eugene farrell said he doubted it would occur 
because the city has no stockade 
parents who fail to abide by the new ordinance may also have 
their photograph placed in the local weekly newspaper for two weeks 
with a caption reading irresponsible parent 
gibson said but the burden of keeping youths out of trouble is

young ira supporters clashed 
with security forces on the anniversary of a defunct british policy 
of detaining people without trial and a teenager was killed 
police said two people were injured in related violence 
police said more than 20 people were arrested during 
disturbances that occurred in roman catholic areas of west belfast 
tuesday night and continued early today 
british news reports said a 15yearold boy died after being 
struck by a plastic bullet fired by security troops trying to 
control young ira supporters throwing gasoline bombs and stones and 
burning british flags 
the royal ulster constabulary northern irelands police force 
would not comment on the incident 
the death is being investigated said a police spokesman 
speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom 
crowds threw stones and gasoline bombs at police and lighted 
bonfires and burned british flags police said a number of 
vehicles including buses and cars were hijacked and set on fire 
on the northern outskirts of belfast gunmen burst into a home 
and injured a man and woman who had spotted them coming and 
barricaded themselves in a room police said 
the gunmen tried to batter down the barricade but failed and 
then fired a number of shots through it hitting both people they 
were hospitalized and reported in ill but stable condition no 
group claimed responsibility 
rioting on the anniversary is an annual event although britain 
abandoned the policy of detaining people without trial in 1975 the 
violence also occurred amid heightened tension over the 20th 
anniversary next week of the deployment of british troops in the 
province 
on aug 9 1971 the british government introduced the policy 
for terrorist suspects in northern ireland in predawn raids that 
day 342 people were arrested 
britain abandoned the policy in december 1975 following 
worldwide condemnation but irish republican army supporters who 
were the main targets continue to mark the anniversary with 
violent antibritish rallies 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting british rule in northern 
ireland it wants to unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the republic of ireland whose population is 95 percent 
catholic 
catholic civil rights demonstrations in 1968 created a violent 
protestant reaction leading to the arrival of british troops who 
soon found themselves fighting the ira in 1972 the government in 
london closed the local parliament and took over direct rule of the 
province

a friend of exus attorney general edwin meese 
iiis said he was guilty only of being in the wrong place and the 
wrong time after his conviction on fraud and racketeering charges 
in the wedtech case 
e robert wallach a san francisco lawyer was convicted tuesday 
of illegally receiving 425000 from wedtech to influence meese and 
other government officials in the companys bid for government 
contracts 
a jury acquitted wallach 55 of a second racketeering 
conspiracy charge stemming from another 100000 he was accused of 
taking from the company 
the threemonth trial in manhattan federal court was the sixth 
to result from the scandal at wedtech a defense contractor that 
closed after allegations of illegal activity were made public 
after the verdict wallach said he was a victim of 
prosecutorial contortions of the facts and would appeal 
i am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place and the 
wrong time he said 
two codefendants one of whom also was linked to meese were 
convicted of racketeering racketeering conspiracy and fraud 
meese who never was charged in the wedtech scandal testified 
that wallach had never asked him to do anything improper for 
wedtech 
wallach defended meese telling reporters nothing that 
happened here casts a single aspersion on that man 
the former attorney general was en route to west point ny 
tuesday night to give a speech at the us military academy and was 
unavailable for comment 
wedtech once a small machine shop in the bronx grew into a 
100 million government contractor through a federal program that 
set aside contracts for minoritycontrolled companies evidence at 
earlier trials showed that wedtech continued to get the nobid 
contracts through bribe schemes even after it ceased to be a 
minorityowned company 
the announcement of the verdict was interrupted for about 20 
minutes when the mother of one of the defendants r kent london 
was overcome with emotion and had trouble breathing oxygen was 
brought to the courtroom for the woman who lawyers said has had 
two heart attacks previously 
the defendants were variously charged in a 21count indictment 
with six separate schemes to defraud wedtech or the government 
through false documents and bribery 
wallach a san francisco lawyer who represented meese during his 
confirmation hearings for attorney general and at a special 
prosecutors investigation in 1984 was convicted of two acts of 
racketeering 
one was defrauding wedtech in september 1983 for 125000 which 
he billed as work for the companys public stock offering but which 
prosecutors said was for his efforts to influence meese and others 
to get an army contract for wedtech 
in the other act wallach was found to have illegally received 
300000 from wedtech officials purportedly for helping the 
company acquire shipyards and a tugbarge system the money was 
actually in anticipation of wallachs employment at the justice 
department where he could influence meese and others the jury 
found 
wallach also was convicted of one charge of conspiracy to 
defraud the government and two fraud charges stemming from the 
payments 
he was acquitted of conspiring with w franklyn chinn and london 
to defraud wedtech of 100000 by covering up the payment to 
wallach chinn meeses former financial adviser and london a 
business associate of chinn were convicted of that charge among 
others 
wallach faces up to 45 years in prison chinn and london could 
get up to 40 years on their two racketeering convictions and lesser 
sentences on the other charges 
all three men also face fines and forfeitures when they are 
sentenced oct 16 
four former wedtech executives including the companys former 
chairman pleaded guilty to bribe and theftrelated charges in 
january 1987 and have testified at several trials including a case 
that resulted in the conviction of former rep mario biaggi 
dny on racketeering charges 
rep robert garcia dny is awaiting trial on charges that he 
extorted 185000 in cash and a diamond and emerald necklace from 
wedtech

social workers put a 9yearold girl with 
aids in a foster home after a report that her mother had sexually 
abused her and punished her with drug injections 
everybody just wants to give her the best we can give her in 
the time she has said david reilly regional director of the 
texas department of human services she is with the person she 
wants to be with and if that works out there is no reason to move 
her 
the girl is now in foster care with a family who knows her and 
will likely remain in state custody until she dies he said 
state district judge tom rickhoff on monday held a closeddoor 
hearing about the girl citing a law requiring confidentiality in 
aids cases 
her mother a drug abuser died of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
the youngster was left to live with relatives but social 
workers became concerned that those surroundings were further 
endangering her life and an emergency court order removed the girl 
and placed her in foster care 
one of the issues believed to have been discussed in the monday 
hearing was whether the child will attend public school 
as far as were concerned shes going to go to school 
reilly said i dont think we have an obligation to tell the 
school about the disease in fact we may be precluded by law 
from telling them

new prime minister geoffrey 
palmer today began forming his cabinet and said there would be no 
domestic or foreign policy changes under his administration 
he also said his administration would be less exciting than 
that of his predecessor david lange who announced his resignation 
monday for health reasons 
a labor party caucus elected palmer prime minister on tuesday 
and chose helen clark to replace him as deputy prime minister 
palmer a lawyer says he pales in comparison to the colorful 
lange who for five years captured world attention by arguing with 
the united states and france over nuclear issues 
langes departure followed major economic change in new zealand 
a former british colony of 33 million in the south pacific 
palmer 47 promised to pursue the lange vision of an independent 
new zealand 
he also reiterated that there would be no change in the nations 
antinuclear stance which led to us warships being banned from 
the nations ports 
the united states welcomed palmers appointment noting he had 
spent considerable time in the united states as an academic 
asked at a news conference today if he was prepared to meet 
president bush palmer replied that he would meet anybody at any 
time 
earlier he said we want to have dialogue with the 
americans 
langes resignation prompted tributes from around the south 
pacific the prime minister of papua new guinea rabbie namaliu 
said he would miss langes fearless dipolomacy 
prime minister bob hawke of australia said that despite some 
policy disagreements the men were friends 
cook island prime minister geoffrey henry said history would 
judge lange as new zealands most effective prime minister so far 
palmer a former attorney general said he would probably 
complete his cabinet appointments by friday 
he also said he offered lange also a lawyer the position of 
attorney general and that lange had said he might consider the 
offer 
palmer said it was certain he would have discussions with us 
ambassadordesignate della newman when she arrives in new zealand 
to take up her post 
but diplomacy is best not conducted through loud speakers in 
the media he said

judges closed down a dump where a fire 
destroyed part of an interstate highway and officials said it could 
take as long as a year to reopen the busy commuter link 
the twojudge panel of the superior courts appellate division 
on tuesday ordered hub recycling and scrap metals co to remove the 
waste under interstate 78 and adjoining route 22 they put the 
cleanup under the state department of environmental protections 
supervision 
gov thomas h kean declared a state of emergency to obtain 
federal funds to rebuild the charred interstate 
flames and heat from a giant pile of debris early monday buckled 
an elevated portion of interstate 78 a critical eastwest link in 
one of the nations busiest highway interchanges between new york 
city and pennsylvania the fire was extinguished tuesday afternoon 
state officials said repairs that forced the closing of a 
1mile stretch of the highway could take a year traffic has been 
rerouted from the roadway which carried five lanes of traffic in 
both directions 
a report in the new york times today said three of the five 
eastbound lanes were supported by a set of columns and beams that 
were sound enough to carry traffic and said that section might 
open within a month or so 
kean lauded the judges decision saying it would pave the way 
for a cleanup at the site which authorities say is an illegal dump 
and waste transfer station hub says its a recycling facility 
state officials have been trying for two years to halt the 
pileup of waste at the fouracre site 
essex county counsel h curtis meanor a former federal judge 
estimated the site contained 50000 tons of waste beneath the 
highways and that it would cost about 100 per ton or about 5 
million to clear it

a suburban referendum on the metropolitan areas 
bus system could determine whether a longdelayed plan to build a 
lightrail mass transit system ever gets rolling 
transit supporters fear a vote by five suburbs to withdraw from 
dallas area rapid transit bus service will derail a 245 billion 
plan to construct 66 miles of rail lines by 2010 the plan also 
calls for an 18mile rail link connecting downtown to the 
dallasfort worth international airport and 37 miles of bus and car 
pool lanes for suburban commuters 
if this plan fails its going to set dallas back 10 to 15 
years said dart board member charles clack 
the transit authority approved the rail plan in june after six 
years of delays 
critics in the suburbs of irving plano carrollton rowlett and 
coppell say the authority has taken too long already and that their 
bus service is not commensurate with the tax dollars they 
contribute to dart they say widening roads and adding tollways 
would be cheaper than a rail system 
there is a great mistrust of dart said pat cotton who has 
worked against the rail plan people feel there have been 
expenditures that have not been wise 
of course weve always had our own cars and we like to drive 
up to our own spots that kind of philosophy has been in place in 
texas for years clack said 
but that philosophy creates rushhour gridlock on dallas 
freeways 
of more than 974000 area residents about 150000 ride dart 
buses daily dart estimates 214000 riders will use the transit 
system once it is complete 
dart spokesman ron whittington fears even more congested 
freeways if suburban bus service ends youre going to put about 
20000 more drivers back on the roads he said thats scary 
in 1983 voters approved a 1cent sales tax to finance a 55 
billion regional bus and rail network a sagging economy forced the 
authority to scale back plans and ask voters last year to approve 
the issue of 1 billion in bonds to start rail construction voters 
in the 16 cities served by dart said no 
now dart officials see the aug 12 suburban referendums as 
crucial for the areas growth 
this is not a vote on dart its a vote on regional 
transportation said board member jim jenne of carrollton he 
believes corporations wont move to dallas unless theyre assured 
of regional transit 
maybe we can get by without mass transit for a couple of 
years clack said but a little down the line were going to 
need one you cant just snap your fingers and have it appear you 
have to start now

a bomb blast at the justice ministry today 
caused minor damage but no casualties police said 
the blast came at a time when the justice minister oltan 
sungurlu has come under criticism from the opposition and press 
because of a 42dayold hunger strike by 200 leftist inmates 
no group claimed immediate responsibility for the bombing 
investigators said the explosive device was placed inside a 
garbage can in the ladies room on the first floor of the ministry 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency reported police detained 
one person but the report was not immediately confirmed 
the explosion came a week after two leftist inmates died due to 
what officials said was dehydration from the hunger strike 
newspapers and other inmates said the men were beaten to death 
the deaths came after they were transferred along with 280 
fasting prisoners from eskisehir province to a prison in aydin 300 
miles west 
the two inmates belonged to the outlawed kurdish labor party a 
guerrilla group that is fighting for an independent state in the 
southeastern parts of turkey 
the inmates began a hunger strike at eskisehir prison on june 28 
to protest restrictions imposed by prison authorities after it was 
discovered that the inmates were trying to tunnel to freedom

israel will refuse to start negotiations for a 
hostage or prisoner swap until it receives signs of life about 
three israeli soldiers held captive in lebanon defense minister 
yitzhak rabin said 
as long as we dont know who is alive and who isnt we will 
discuss no other details rabin said tuesday night at a meeting 
of his labor partys central committee 
earlier tuesday rabin told reporters after meeting un envoy 
marrack goulding that confirming the israelis were alive must be a 
first stage in contacts with shiite radicals believed to hold the 
israeli soldiers and most of the 16 foreign hostages in lebanon 
as a second step rabin added israel would provide the shiites 
with information on the whereabouts of an estimated 300 of their 
followers imprisoned by israel 
only then will we negotiate the terms for the exchange he 
said 
rabin also said israel considers the international committee of 
the red cross to be the most suitable channel for negotiating a 
swap with the proiranian hezbollah movement an umbrella 
organization for shiite fundamentalist groups in lebanon 
hezbollah today claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb 
attack in south lebanon that injured five israeli soldiers and a 
lebanese militiaman the two suicide car bombers died in the blast 
five miles north of the israeli border 
rabin indicated there had been little progress made so far in 
resolving the hostage crisis by saying unfortunately until this 
moment no lebanese organization turned to the international red 
cross with any proposal 
whoever wants real business its better to turn to the 
international red cross with whatever terms he has in mind rabin 
added 
goulding who returned to new york after shuttling between 
beirut and tel aviv on the hostage situation said his meeting with 
rabin focused on un demands that israel release a moslem cleric 
kidnapped by israeli commandos from south lebanon on july 28 
rabin rejected the demand saying 33yearold sheikh abdul karim 
obeid would be freed only as part of a swap for israeli and foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
the israeli leader also differed with gouldings assertion that 
obeids capture does not help efforts to free hostages i 
believe the fact it was done provides a bigger chance to return the 
israeli soldiers missing and the captives home rabin said 
the three israeli soldiers believed to be held by hezbollah are 
rahamim alsheikh and yosef fink who were captured in south lebanon 
in february 1986 and an air navigator ron arad shot down while 
on a bombing mission near sidon in october 1986 
shlomo alsheikh the father of one of the israeli prisoners held 
by the shiites was quoted today by the yediot ahronot daily as 
saying he learned 10 days ago for the first time that he his 
son rahamim is alive 
thats what we were told we were told that there is 
information our son is alive and well thank god alsheikh said 
alsheikh did not make clear where he received the information 
and israeli officials refused to discuss the report

scientists are hoping the microbes they 
tinkered with will vanish quickly after the nations first openair 
field test of a pesticide made of genetically engineered virus 
weather permitting scientists from cornell universitys boyce 
thompson institute for plant research intended to spray the virus 
today on a field of cabbage at the new york state agricultural 
experiment station 
the test is designed to see if a genetically disabled virus will 
disappear from the environment quickly after attacking the insects 
it is aimed at destroying rather than lingering in the field said 
h alan wood the virologist who will direct the test 
its a hurdle in terms of the genetic engineering of viruses 
and quite a significant step if its successful wood said it 
would be a big step for biological control 
the test could provide new ways to fight plant diseases and 
pests while lessening dependence on pesticides about 3 billion 
pounds of pesticides are used in the united states each year 
scientists are aiming their test at the cabbage looper a pale 
green caterpillar that attacks more than a dozen kinds of 
vegetables including cabbage beets broccoli and cauliflower 
the virus they are using is identical to naturally occurring 
strains known as baculoviruses which can cause viral epidemics in 
many agricultural and forest insect pests researchers will remove 
a gene that provides a protective protein coat from the virus 
scientists eventually hope to splice a new gene into the virus 
one that would make it more deadly to pests wood said the new 
more virulent virus could be sprayed onto plants where it would 
kill pests and then die quickly 
the field test will be conducted on a twoacre doughnutshaped 
plot containing 20000 cabbage plants of which 2500 plants in the 
center will be sprayed with the virus 
the plot will be monitored through 1991 
the environmental protection agency approved the field test in 
july after determining it posed no environmental or human health 
hazards 
several genetically altered bacteria have been tested before 
but this is the first altered viral insecticide tested in the 
field said fred betz a biologist at the us environmental 
protection agency

in detroit said daughetee claimed he had been in hamtramck the 
night before bushs speech 
he told agents he had picked out the perfect spot to shoot 
from but couldnt reach it on speech day because of metal 
detectors huse said he then ran to several areas trying to 
get close enough for a shot but before he could shoot the 
president finished and left the podium 
maddux said daughetee had spoken of carrying guns including a 
22caliber automatic pistol and a 380caliber automatic handgun 
but it wasnt clear what gun daughetee had in hamtramck

needed the money to go back east and kill the president 
daughetee also told investigators he committed a spree of bank 
heists dating back to november 1986 beginning with a bank in 
sacramento calif maddux said the other banks daughetee admitted

like a burned field in some houses the windows were broken and the 
floors were covered with ash but otherwise the area looked 
untouched by the explosions

more than 100 savannah river site employees 
drank water contaminated with a carcinogenic solvent for 15 months 
but an official from the nuclear weapons plant says they were not 
harmed 
the incident occurred after a drinking water supply line was 
mistakenly connected to a system carrying tainted process water 
said becky apter a spokeswoman for westinghouse savannah river 
co which operates the plant for the government 
none of the workers have shown symptoms of illness associated 
with trichloroethylene or tce a potent degreaser and solvent that 
was found in the water she said 
the health effects are nonexistent ms apter said what 
our doctors told us was the level of exposure they consumed was so 
low that there would be minimal health effects 
reactors at savannah river the nations sole source of tritium 
for nuclear weapons have been closed for more than a year because 
of maintenance and safety problems 
the mistake occurred in march 1988 when a water line was being 
installed to a new building du pont which built the facility and 
operated it for about 30 years was plant operator at the time and 
the work was performed by a subcontractor ms apter would not 
identify 
a du pont engineer who was responsible for the job certified it 
had been done correctly ms apter said but state officials said 
the engineer was working from an erroneous blueprint 
ms apter declined to identify the engineer who she said was 
still employed at the facility 
medical records for all the employees were checked after the 
contamination was discovered and physicians found no related 
health problems she said 
the contaminated water was found in only one building officials 
said after testing water in all buildings in the administration 
area 
although federal drinking water standards were exceeded the 
levels monitored in the service water are well below what would be 
considered dangerous said jim hightower a savannah river 
physician however we will continue to assess any possible 
health effects as part of the annual medical examination program 
samples from the building with the contaminated water showed 
levels of tce averaged 26 parts per billion the environmental 
protection agency considers 5 parts per billion a safe level 
tce has caused cancer in laboratory animals and is suspected of 
doing so in humans the chemical also has been shown to cause 
damage to the liver and other organs as well as sterility 
developmental problems in children and damage to the nervous 
system according to the epa 
the mixup in the water systems was discovered last month when 
repairs were made to the system ms apter said when workers were 
unable to turn off the water they realized the two systems were 
connected

condition of anonymity said tuesday that differences over how the 
center should be managed prompted dexter king and executive 
director barbara williamsskinner to decide to resign the source 
did not say what those differences were 
dexter king was named president in january and officially took 
office april 4 the anniversary of his fathers assassination 
saying he wanted to place the center on a solid financial base and 
cut its dependency on donations 
messages seeking comment from king at his entertainment company 
visionary development corp and his home were not returned nor 
were calls to at least six king center board members 
the board said it would issue a definitive statement at an 
appropriate time

two abortionrights activists running 
in the first state election since the supreme court ruling on 
abortion emerged the apparent winners in the eightway race for an 
assembly seat and will meet in a runoff oct 3 
tuesdays results occurred in a district known for its 
conservatism even by southern california standards 
i believe the abortion issue was the deciding factor in this 
election said jeannine correia who was the top votegetter 
among the two democrats in the race 
the big winner appeared to be tricia hunter the only 
abortionrights candidate among six republicans who made a late 
surge to edge past candidate richard lyles hunter had 14658 votes 
to 14446 votes for lyles 
some 500 absentee ballots will be counted later this week said 
deborah seiler a spokeswoman for the secretary of states office 
lyles said he was optimistic the absentee votes would reverse the 
outcome 
voters in the sprawling district which covers arid sections of 
san diego and riverside counties were picking a successor to gop 
assemblyman bill bradley who died of cancer june 1 
voters were free to pick from among six republicans and two 
democrats who appeared on the same ballot none of the candidates 
won 50 percent of the vote forcing a runoff between the top 
votegetter from each party 
the district is largely republican 542 percent to 327 
percent democrat making the gop candidate an overwhelming 
favorite 
hunter 36 of bonita is a nurse and president of the state 
board of registered nursing 
activists on both sides of the abortion issue regarded the 
election as a significant indicator of public opinion it was the 
first election for a state office since the july 3 supreme court 
ruling in webster vs health reproductive services inc which gave 
states more authority to limit abortions 
if it hadnt been for the 100000 the nurses association put 
into tricia hunters campaign the abortion issue never would have 
gained prominence in this race because she never would have been 
seen as a viable candidate said lyles a 42yearold management 
consultant from poway 
it certainly gained more attention than it would have if the 
webster decision hadnt come down but our research showed most of 
the voters were concerned about other issues like water and 
education 
correia an instructor for the developmentally disabled who 
lives in poway received 3186 votes while the other democrat on 
the ballot stephen thorne 34 of escondido got 1256 votes 
thorne also is prochoice 
the district has about 240000 registered voters

investigators today searched for five missing 
people and the cause of a blaze that killed at least three people 
at a rooming house whose landlord had been charged with failing to 
install an adequate sprinkler system 
its going to be a long and tedious job said deputy fire 
chief william conway the buildings not very stable and were 
going to be taking it apart brick by brick 
authorities said building violations contributed to the still 
uncertain number of deaths and several injuries suffered among 
dozens of tenants who lowered themselves to safety on ropes after 
the fire broke out early tuesday 
trooper dennis galvin of the state fire marshals office began 
inspecting the ben crest plaza today and said he hoped to learn 
where the blaze began and whether the alarm system was working 
were just getting our feet wet he said 
the city previously had filed a criminal complaint against the 
buildings owner for failing to install a proper sprinkleralarm 
system an attorney for the landlord said the sprinkler 
installation was to have begun next week 
benjamin amero 50 jumped to his death while trying to escape 
the fire shortly after it broke out about 1230 am two other 
unidentified victims were recovered from the buildings rubble 
state fire marshal joseph okeefe said an adequate 
sprinkleralarm system would have doused the hallways and alerted 
the fire department instead he said the system was substandard 
and residents who claimed the buildings fire alarm didnt sound 
were left scrambling to safety 
it went up like this said tenant dwayne rogers 25 
striking a match and shaking his head while watching it burn 
just like that the whole building 
leo mcdonnell 46 whose life was saved when rogers awoke him 
made it to safety by clambering to an adjacent roof 
others werent so lucky 
i saw one guy start out the window and then the smoke blocked 
the view mcdonnell said and then when the smoke cleared he 
was gone i dont know if he fell or went back in 
survivors said the screams of their neighbors pierced the night 
it wasnt screams of help said bobby barrett 19 it was 
more like screams of burning 
the fire marshal and lynn police disagreed on the number of 
guests on the night of the blaze but early reports put the number 
at 37 by late in the day officials said five people were still 
unaccounted for 
extensive structural damage raised safety concerns and hampered 
tuesdays investigation said galvin 
capt john decareau head of lynns arson squad said it was too 
soon to determine the fires cause 
conway said city law allows climbing ropes in lieu of external 
fire escapes but tenants and rescue workers claimed many of the 
ropes didnt reach the ground so they were either left dangling or 
forced to jump to an adjacent building 
we saw a couple of people that couldnt reach the roof and 
they got torched said rogers who tried to wake other tenants 
before escaping to an adjacent roof 
al divirgilio mayor of this city of 80000 on the seacoast five 
miles north of boston said two criminal complaints were pending 
against the rooming houses owner 
one involved the owners failure to install a sprinkler system 
required under a 2yearold city ordinance adopted after a 1984 
rooming house fire that killed 15 people the mayor said 
leo allard the ben crests owner has been battling the 
ordinance in court and refused to comment tuesday allards 
attorney james e smith said his client and other rooming house 
owners were seeking reasonable time to install sprinkler systems

the president of the governing liberal democratic 
party toshiki kaifu today was declared prime minister after an 
unprecedented parliamentary clash over who should have the job 
kaifu 58 became japans third prime minister in 10 weeks after 
sex and money scandals and a major loss in upper house elections 
forced his two predecessors to step down 
there are many difficulties awaiting the liberal democratic 
party and i will try to work hard and express my frank feelings to 
the people kaifu said after his selection by the lower house 
where his party has a comfortable majority 
the less powerful upper house supported socialist party leader 
takako doi 
it was the first time in 41 years that the two houses had 
clashed over who should head the government under the 
constitution if the houses cannot agree on a prime minister the 
lower house decision prevails 
on tuesday kaifu was elected president of the liberal 
democratic party which lost public support after the disclosure 
last year that the recruit co conglomerate tried to buy political 
favors from leading politicians 
kaifu has said he received about 110000 in legal political 
donations over five years from the recruit co 
two people he named today to top posts in the governing party 
also have recruit links ichiro ozawa the new party 
secretarygeneral and shunjiro karasawa the new chairman of the 
decisionmaking executive council have acknowledged receiving 
legal donations from the company 
hajime tamura speaker of the lower house declared kaifu prime 
minister in a brief announcement 
ms doi said she was not discouraged 
today the door was only half opened but i am determined to 
continue to work to fully open this door some day she said 
aug 9 surely reflects the beginning of the end of the long rule 
by the ldp 
the general secretary of the socialist party tsuruo yamaguchi 
said ms dois upper house victory proved we will be seeing a 
very unstable political situation in coming months 
for the first time in 41 years the wheels of history have 
shifted he told the associated press formally the lower 
house choice prevails but politically the upper house vote has 
proven that this administration is only half an administration and 
kaifu is only half a prime minister 
kaifu said the delay caused by the disagreement between the 
houses was a severe consequence of our election defeat a 
reference to july 23 elections for half the seats in the upper 
house 
in that vote the liberal democrats lost their majority in the 
upper house for the first time in their 34year history 
kaifu is succeeding sousuke uno who resigned after the july 
vote he lasted only 69 days in office losing support because of 
reports he kept a paid mistress 
earlier today unos cabinet resigned en masse clearing the way 
for kaifu to form a new government 
uno replaced noboru takeshita who resigned because of the 
recruit scandal which tainted most of the top figures in the 
governing party 
the tarnished reputations of top liberal democratic figures made 
it possible for kaifu to vault into the party leadership even 
though he has little personal clout as a member of a minor party 
faction and has not served in top party or government offices 
but kaifu brings a more youthful image to japans highest office 
and has credentials as a reformer he was a member of the partys 
reform committee and an aide to the late prime minister takeo miki 
when miki was trying to clean up japanese politics in the 1970s 
in addition to ozawa and karasawa kaifu today appointed hiroshi 
mitsuzuka to be head of his partys policy affairs research 
council mitsuzuka the outgoing foreign minister has said he did 
not have any connections to the recruit co 
japanese newspapers gave mixed early notices to kaifus 
election the liberalleaning asahi shimbun said it hopes he will 
not stumble badly and it called on kaifu to work for genuine 
changes in his own party 
the conservative yomiuri shimbuns editorial applauded the 
debate that accompanied the election for party leader 
after the cabinet is formed kaifus first task should be to 
carry out political reform to regain public trust the very fact 
that kaifu is not a faction leader demonstrates the acceptance of 
the need for reform yomiuri said

the former top aide to ptl founder jim 
bakker pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy and agreed to testify 
against the evangelist bakkers attorney said the deal was suspect 
because the aide had sold his soul 
us district judge robert potter on tuesday also refused to 
delay bakkers trial turning down complaints from defense 
attorneys about pretrial publicity 
whether this case is tried in charlotte north carolina or 
ottumwa iowa two years from now there is going to be pretrial 
publicity it is one of the prices that we all must pay for a free 
press potter said 
jury selection is scheduled to begin aug 21 with opening 
arguments a week later 
richard dortch former executive vice president of ptl pleaded 
guilty to one count of mail fraud one of wire fraud by telephone 
one of wire fraud by television and one of conspiracy according to 
one of his attorneys mark calloway 
beyond that we have no comment calloway said 
a plea agreement calls for dortch to cooperate with the us 
attorneys office and the justice department in whatever form 
requested including sworn testimony in court and documentary 
materials 
richard dortch will become the key witness against jim 
bakker said washington lawyer ben cotten who represents 
convicted former ptl aides david and james taggart 
having pleaded to conspiracy with jim bakker being the 
alleged coconspirator it will be very difficult for bakker to 
convince the jury that at least on the charge of conspiracy hes 
innocent cotten said 
he also said the taggarts would consider testifying against 
bakker 
george t davis bakkers attorney said he was not surprised by 
the plea agreement and said dortchs testimony has got to have 
some effect 
these kind of deals are somewhat suspect from the very nature 
of the animal because it is not uncommon for people to sell their 
souls if necessary to save their bodies davis said 
under the agreement dortch could face a maximum sentence of 10 
years in prison and a 500000 fine prosecutors agreed to ask the 
presiding judge at sentencing to dismiss the remaining 20 charges 
against dortch 
the agreement also specifies that dortch could be asked to make 
restitution 
dortch had tried unsuccessfully to have his trial separated from 
bakker the two men were charged in a 24count indictment with 
diverting more than 4 million in ptl money to their own benefit 
a federal grand jury indicted them on eight counts each of mail 
fraud 15 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and 
wire fraud bakker could face 120 years in prison and more than 5 
million in fines on the charges 
the case stemmed from a 16month investigation into the 
televangelism empire under bakkers leadership the grand jury

the iranianbacked hezbollah said today 
that efforts to free western hostages in lebanon suffered their 
greatest setback as a result of israels abduction of a shiite 
moslem cleric from south lebanon 
a statement released by the partys information center said the 
july 28 kidnapping of sheik abdul karim obeid and two relatives was 
a terrorist crime of piracy 
israel has offered to trade obeid and all shiite prisoners it 
holds for three israeli servicemen and the 16 western hostages held 
in lebanon 
the zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of his 
failure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting sheik 
obeid hezbollah said 
it is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy 
after this foolish crime it has become impossible to release the 
israeli pows and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked 
it said 
moreover the refusal of the enemy to release sheik obeid and 
his two relatives and his linkage of the problem of the zionist 
pows with that of the hostages might hurt the west and further 
complicate the hostage issue the statement added 
hezbollah irans main ally in lebanon is believed to be the 
umbrella group for extremist factions holding most of the hostages 
we contend that past efforts for the release of the western 
hostages in lebanon is passing through the greatest setback because 
of the foolhardiness committed by the racist zionists who appear 
perfectly willing to sacrfice all others for their selfish 
interests the statement said 
it repeated its urging that the west pressure israel to free 
obeid 
israeli officials have said obeid admitted under interrogation 
that he took part in planning terrorist attacks including the 
abduction of us marine lt col william r higgins in south 
lebanon feb 17 1988 
hezbollah said israel is lying about the reported confessions 
the organization of the oppressed on earth an extemist group 
made up of proiranian zealots said july 31 that it had hanged 
higgins in retaliation for israels refusal to free obeid 
higgins 44 commanded a 76man observer unit attached to the 
un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when he was kidnapped 
there are eight americans among the 16 hostages in lebanon the 
hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985

antigovernment rebels armed with 
axes machetes and clubs massacred 54 civilians near the southern 
coastal town of xaixai the official news agency aim said today 
the report said most of the victims were kidnapped by guerrillas 
of the mozambique national resistance in gaza province and marched 
to fidel castro village just outside xaixai and 90 miles 
northeast of maputo the capital 
the civilians were hacked or beaten to death on monday aim 
said quoting a report in maputos noticias daily newspaper the 
report said the fatalities included 13 women and eight children and 
that 17 people were injured 
the attack occurred while rebel leaders and government 
representatives were meeting in kenya in a bid to settle this 
countrys 12yearold civil war mozambican churchmen acting on 
behalf of their government met with rebel representatives tuesday 
but no major breakthroughs were reported 
no explanation was provided of why the civilians were killed 
however the rebels who have been accused of many civilian 
atrocities sometimes take civilians prisoner to carry their 
equipment and then kill them afterward 
no government acknowledges supporting the guerrillas south 
africa openly supported them until 1984 and some reports say it 
continues to do so 
however south africa says it is now abiding by a nonaggression 
pact with neighboring mozambique 
president joaquim chissano says he accepts south africas word 
however officials in mozambique still believe the rebels receive 
help from nongovernmental groups in south africa 
the war has killed 600000 people created more than a million 
refugees and left nearly half the countrys 147 million people 
dependent on food aid

the aircraft carrier uss america was 
reported today to have resumed patrol off the coast of iran 
putting another powerful military force at president bushs 
disposal in the lebanon hostage crisis 
the nineship battle group was in singapore nearly 4000 miles 
away when the crisis arose july 31 with the reported hanging of 
us marine lt col william r higgins by his lebanese shiite 
captors and a death threat against a second american hostage 
the america cut short its port visit by four days to return to 
its assigned duty station in the north arabian sea a voyage 
requiring nearly a week 
us officials refused as a matter of policy to discuss ship 
movements but defense secretary dick cheney told reporters in 
washington that the carrier was headed for the north end of the 
indian ocean 
a convoy located in the arabian sea or further south in the 
indian ocean could steam north through the gulf of oman and enter 
the persian gulf 
a pentagon spokesman said on tuesday that the america was 
conducting routine operations in the indian ocean but would not 
say where other sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
it was resuming normal duties in the north arabian sea 
the battle group was deployed in june to the navys joint task 
force middle east the only us surface fleet operating within 
striking distance of iran the force also includes 10 ships in the 
persian gulf 
the 79000ton americas port call at singapore had been 
scheduled well in advance and a military source called it just 
the breaks that the hostage crisis arose during its absence 
us warships in the gulf region have operated at reduced alert 
status and spent more time in port since iraq and iran agreed last 
year to a ceasefire in their eightyear war 
administration sources in washington have been quoted as saying 
bush had opted for a military reprisal if any more hostages were 
killed they said he would probably use planes from the carrier uss 
coral sea in the eastern mediterranean to strike suspected 
terrorist strongholds in lebanon 
however the sources have not ruled out an attack on iran which 
is considered to wield great influence over shiite moslem groups 
holding western hostages in lebanon 
in that event the america and its more than 80 combat aircraft 
would be the probable choice 
military analysts agreed that the most logical target for 
military action against iran would be its big oil terminal at kharg 
island 500 miles northwest of the strait of hormuz the gulf 
outlet to the arabian sea 
for the us planes it would mean dodging the terminals 
antiaircraft defenses that downed a number of iraqi planes during 
the war 
the us warships in the gulf are designed mainly for missile 
war against aircraft ships and submarines their 5inch and 76mm 
guns would be hard put to inflict more than token damage on a 
sprawling complex like kharg island 
military sources ruled out any use of the coral sea against 
iran noting that its planes would have to make a 3000mile round 
trip through the airspace of several countries

us attorney general dick thornburgh says he 
wants to establish an international unit in the justice department 
devoted mostly to curbing drug trafficking 
often more than 50 percent of my day is devoted to some matter 
relating to our international involvement in fighting drug 
trafficking money laundering international organized crime and 
business fraud environmental depredations terrorism or 
espionage thornburgh said in a speech tuesday at the american 
bar association convention 
outlining president bushs 1 billion crimefighting package 
thornburgh said he would seek congressional approval for an 
international affairs office he said the state department has 
endorsed the idea 
a spokesman for the attorney generals office said existing 
money could be redirected to fund the unit 
thornburghs proposal to have an office that reports directly to 
him to coordinate justice department international law enforcement 
efforts comes at a time in which the federal battle against drugs 
is under great scrutiny 
the presidents drug policy coordinator william bennett is 
preparing a congressionally mandated battle plan as part of the 
effort us attorneys around the nation recently issued a report 
that placed heavy blame on international drug trafficking for the 
30 percent increase in violent crime in the united states in the 
past decade 
although violent crime is mainly the responsibility of state and 
local authorities the federal law enforcement cannot look the 
other way while violence often drugrelated ravages many of our 
innercity communities and subjects innocent citizens to the 
crossfire of turf wars between urban terrorist gangs thornburgh 
said 
bushs crime package focused on increasing the penalties for the 
criminal use of guns ending plea bargaining in such cases hiring 
more investigators and prosecutors and doubling the space in 
federal prisons thornburgh said 
such a comprehensive approach if replicated at the state and 
local level can go a long way toward restoring muchneeded 
credibility to the deterrent capacity of our criminal justice 
system he said 
regarding drug use and trafficking in the united states 
thornburgh said the only way to win the war on drugs was to 
reestablish the values that make a drugdependent lifestyle an 
inadmissible option in this great nation 
he praised the militarys mandatory drug testing program saying 
it reduced the incidence of drug use from 27 percent in 1980 to 48 
percent last year thornburgh urged more drug testing of american 
workers 
speaking to reporters after the speech thornburgh said the us 
supreme courts validation of drugtesting meant private and 
publicsector employers could begin reasonable drugtesting 
progams 
i think private employers should examine the appropriateness 
of it in the workplace he said

international judges are working quietly to 
resolve disputes between the united states and iran over billions 
of dollars of frozen assets despite bitter differences between the 
two nations 
the members of the iranus claims tribunal in the hague 
netherlands have remained isolated from daytoday politics on 
tuesday the state department rejected a suggestion that american 
hostages in lebanon could be released if the united states agreed 
to release frozen iranian assets 
the englishlanguage tehran times quoted a source saying iran 
would intercede to gain the release of the american hostages if 
washington gave assurances it would release frozen iranian assets 
eight american hostages are believed held by proiranian shiite 
moslems in lebanon 
the questions of the assets have no connection whatsoever 
with the hostage issue said state department spokesman richard 
boucher this is a legal process its a very technical process 
and its the business of the tribunal to work through the claims 
and the cases before them and to work them out 
boucher said the united states refused to consider tying the 
hostages fate to issues before the tribunal but is continuing its 
intensive diplomatic efforts to free the captives 
however the new york times quoted an unidentified senior 
administration official as saying there may be more room for 
maneuvering 
and while we would not give a direct quid pro quo we would 
offer some understanding or agreement that if you use your good 
offices to get the hostages we will look favorably on your desire 
to get the assets this official was quoted as saying 
the tribunal established in 1981 after iran freed american 
hostages held at the us embassy in tehran for 444 days has done 
its work in a nonpolitical environment 
since it was established the tribunal composed of nine 
international judges has resolved billions of dollars worth of 
claims three judges are american three are iranian and three are 
from other countries 
the state department said us nationals have been awarded about 
12 billion while iranians have received about 118 million 
the claims made by banks companies individuals and 
governments stem from the 1979 breakdown in diplomatic relations 
between the two nations 
the united states froze billions of dollars of iranian assets 
including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military 
equipment bought by shah mohammad reza pahlavi before his regime 
was toppled iran also seized us assets 
when the tribunal was established the united states transferred 
about 99 billion in frozen assets to escrow accounts and to iran 
washington has little control over that money the disposition of 
which is regulated by tribunal rulings 
but the iranians have filed separate claims amounting to 
roughly 12 billion for military equipment bought under the shah 
the state department said it doesnt know how much the shah had 
already paid but he had committed to buying 20 billion worth of 
hardware 
iran has generally followed the tribunals decisions making 
payments to claimants when ordered to do so american officials 
said some american companies however have appealed the 
tribunals decisions in us courts effectively delaying payments 
they said

israel carved out the security zone in south lebanon a 
6to10milewide strip after withdrawing most of its troops from

president bush is saying the right words 
but must turn on the music and dance by pushing policies that 
will help black americans reach economic equality civil rights 
leader joseph e lowery said today 
we have already seen a friendlier white house a gentler white 
house but now we must activate the kind of budget the kind of job 
training opportunities the kind of rectifying of the past few 
years of neglect to move from righteous ceremony to righteous 
sacrament the president of the southern christian leadership 
conference told the national urban league 
bush addressed the leagues annual conference on tuesday saying 
that his administration will not tolerate discrimination bigotry 
or bias of any kind period 
we have heard mr bush say the right words now he must turn 
on the music and dance with me lowery said dance to the 
harmonious melodies of full employment adequate wages dance to 
the rhythm of affordable and available health care for all of the 
citizens of this country 
lowery also called for action from congress which he said has 
yet to demonstrate the advantage of the democratic majority that we 
helped bring into being particularly in the senate 
what difference does it make whether its a democratic 
majority or republican majority if they cant override a veto to 
keep the minimum wage at its present level lowery asked bush 
recently vetoed legislation to raise the minimum and the veto was 
sustained in congress 
urban league president john e jacob said following bushs 
address tuesday i am willing to concede that the first six to 
eight months is the rhetoric period in judging a new 
administration 
we will use the next 12 months to determine how well he does 
in carrying that out his rhetoric is right he is saying the right 
things now we have to find out whether he is willing to do the 
right things jacob said 
bush the first president to address an urban league conference 
since president carter in 1979 received generous applause tuesday 
but joan n tokley president of the tampa fla urban league 
said i would have felt a lot more comfortable if the president 
had addressed the recent rulings of the supreme court especially 
those that deal with affirmative action 
recent decisions of the court have held that state and local 
governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public works 
hiring that minorities must meet higher statistical standards to 
prove they are being relegated to less desirable jobs and that 
white workers not involved in an 8yearold affirmative action 
ruling were nevertheless entitled to attack it in court 
no matter what he says his moral and philosophical conviction 
is at this point i havent heard him say anything about the 
laws in this country that were designed to protect blacks women 
and other minorities ms tokley said and until he does i 
will not be convinced that he actually means what he says 
harold hood a michigan court of appeals judge attending the 
conference said bushs address was a very neutral talk as far as 
minorities were concerned 
i dont know that i expect him to be on our side hood said 
id be happy if he isnt against us and at least i didnt get 
the sense that hes against us and thats a plus 
bush told the delegates the gulf between white and black america 
has narrowed but has not been closed 
closing that gulf eliminating it for all time is the next 
chapter we must write in the unfolding history the unfinished 
history of civil rights bush said 
he conceded that he and civil rights leaders have disagreed 
about how to accomplish that 
weve argued societys argued about affirmative action 
about quotas goals and timetables about setasides he said 
but the most important point the president said is that 
bigotry and bias may take more subtle forms than in the past 
but they persist and as long as they do our work is not over

the san francisco organizer of underground 
tests of an experimental aids drug says he will accept a government 
invitation to discuss bringing the trials into the open 
martin delaney codirector of the aids education group project 
inform said tuesday that he found the food and drug 
administrations offer to discuss sanctioning the trials a positive 
development 
we have said from the beginning we would like to do this in 
the open delaney said 
the clandestine trial began in april when the drug began to be 
viewed by aids patients as a last hope delaney said he and others 
started the unauthorized testing to find out whether it worked 
before its uncontrolled use became widespread going through the 
fda would have taken too long he said but he also has said that 
he and others kept the fda apprised of the study 
the fda began investigating the underground trials of compound q 
in june after a patient died and two others had adverse reactions 
delaney said it was unclear whether compound q was related to the 
death 
compound q is a protein from the root of a cucumberlike plant 
that has been used for centuries in china to induce abortions and 
treat certain tumors delaneys group smuggled the drug into the 
country with the help of couriers 
the fda told delaney in a letter he received tuesday to stop the 
trials but offered to talk about conforming them to fda 
regulations 
while we cannot condone the unapproved administration of 
trichosanthin compound q we share your belief that important 
drug evaluation information may be generated by communitybased 
organizations said the letter signed by carl c peck director 
of the fdas center for drug evaluation and research 
we therefore want to meet with you and with other concerned 
parties just as soon as possible to discuss the possibility of 
your participation in a communitybased trial that complies 
with existing law and regulations the letter said 
the fda has come to rely increasingly on communitybased trials 
a concept pioneered by aids activists in which local physicians 
administer experimental therapies to aids patients and keep 
detailed records as part of a safety and efficacy study 
the underground study of 42 patients is nearly completed 
treatments with the drug have finished and analysis of the data is 
expected to be completed within the month delaney said 
we will have enough data to make a reliable judgment to know 
whether this is a big deal and worth further testing he said 
after that everybody at fda is going to have to scratch their 
heads and ask why it takes 3 years under normal fdaapproved 
circumstances to make the same determination 
if the drug is worth testing further delaney said he and others 
would bring the data to washington and talk to fda officials about 
opening fdasanctioned communitybased clinical trials 
the only approved clinical trial of the drug for aids patients 
is being conducted at san francisco general hospital a highly 
purified form of trichosanthin developed at the university of 
california at san francisco and genelabs inc of redwood city 
calif is being used in that trial 
the fda says its procedure for approving drugs including 
several levels of clinical trials is designed to determine 
reliably the safety and effectiveness of a drug as well as to 
protect those who volunteer to participate

rescuers extended their search 
today across the border into sudan in the hopes of finding texas 
rep mickey leland and 13 others who disappeared two days ago while 
flying to a refugee camp in southwestern ethiopia 
ethiopian authorities reported today that a plane had been heard 
flying monday near mizan teferi 50 miles south of the fugnido 
refugee camp where leland and his entourage were headed 
the twinengine plane carrying leland 44 and the others 
vanished during bad weather near ethiopiansudanese border 480 
miles southwest of addis ababa 
leland a democratic from houston and the chairman of the house 
select committee on hunger was in ethiopia on a return visit 
because of his keen interest in africas refugee problem 
the twin otter a plane commonly used for bush flying in africa 
also carried three members of lelands staff a friend of the 
politician four americans from the us embassy and from the us 
agency for international development and five ethiopians three 
government officials the pilot and copilot 
up to 10 small planes were being used in the search today 
directed by ethiopias civil aviation authority 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said an air force medical 
evacuation plane left germany this morning en route to addis ababa 
in case it was needed 
the weather today was markedly better than tuesday when heavy 
clouds and poor visibility hampered planes coursing the cold 
plateau in ethiopia said john guerra political officer at the 
us embassy in addis ababa 
rescuers continue to focus on a region called dembidola about 
75 miles north of fugnido where ethiopian authorities said a small 
plane reportedly was heard circling monday according to us 
embassy officials the dembidola region borders mizan teferi 
earlier embassy officials said they were told the plane 
actually had been sighted near dembidola but today acknowledged 
they had been misinformed 
dembidola is in an accessible region of foothills between 
mountains that rise up to 12000 feet and swampy plateaus 
stretching to the sudanese border communications with dembidolo 
and mizan teferi as with most areas outside the capital are bad 
to nonexistent 
us embassy spokesman james haley said the search had been 
extended slightly across the sudanese border on the theory lelands 
plane had the fuel capacity to go that far and may have crossed the 
border to avoid bad weather 
on tuesday robert houdek charge daffairs at the us embassy 
in addis ababa said the lack of radio or telecommunications 
could provide a benign explanation for why we havent heard 
anything 
police security officials and local peasants associations have 
been enlisted in ground searches along the flight path said houdek 
haley said a us air force c141 medical evacuation aircraft 
was expected to arrive later today from west germany for assistance 
president bush telephoned lelands wife alison in houston on 
tuesday and promised his administration will do all we can to 
learn the fate of the plane 
shes strong has a lot of hope and we all pray that hes 
safe bush told a meeting of the national urban league in 
washington where delegates observed a moment of silent prayer for 
lelands survival 
i think it says a lot about mickey that he was on his sixth 
humanitarian mission to help feed the hungry in that part of the 
world bush said 
lelands twin otter left addis ababa in poor visibility at about 
1030 am monday after a twohour delay caused by the bad weather 
said embassy officer guerra 
the plane was last heard from 15 minutes after it took off 
the americans on board included patrice johnson lelands chief 
of staff hugh johnson of the hunger committee staff and joyce f 
williams of the staff of rep ron dellums dcalif according to 
lelands office in washington 
fugnido camp is run by the un high commissioner for refugees 
and is one of four in the region that house more than 300000 
refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring sudan

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
aug 2 
san antonio light on terrorism 
no matter what option president george bush selects to respond 
to the new terroristic activities in the middle east that option 
must not involve negotiation with the terrorists under any 
circumstances 
bush began weighing his options after the reported hanging of 
marine lt col william higgins a member of the united nations 
peacekeeping force by his lebanese kidnappers even as the 
terrorists threatened other murders 
our president made an urgent call for all parties holding 
hostages in the middle east to release them immediately to begin 
to reverse the cycle of violence in that region 
in bushs policy crisis over the new terroristic activities he 
confronts the same problems his two presidential predecessors 
encountered in relation to middle east atrocities an enemy in 
large part unseen splintered into many religious factions with 
many different names embracing a culture in which these splinter 
groups play by rules with which we are not familiar 
it would be easy to invoke a kneejerk reaction of an eye for an 
eye in relation to the activities of terrorists but that kind of 
retaliation is not effective against such a mysterious enemy a 
diffused target is difficult to hit 
because each situation of middle east terrorism is unique it is 
difficult for this nation to establish one national policy to cover 
all 
the nonegotiation policy however must be retained

north jersey herald and news passaic nj on terrorism 
its time to admit it the west just doesnt have a handle on 
how to deal with savage mideast terrorists 
threats against the american hostages in the middle east make it 
important to recognize a few basic facts 
anger over the execution should be directed straight at the 
proiranian group that says it acted in retaliation for an israeli 
commando raid and capture of sheik abdul karim obeid 
the bush administration must consider a more active military 
role in protecting americans who are held hostage 
an international effort must be made to pressure mideast 
governments into discouraging terrorist acts 
a decade of watching in horror and lame condemnations has not 
made the world a safer place honorable world leaders must now 
stand together boldly to hold terrorists accountable for their 
grisly deeds

the commercial review portland ind on terrorism 
if george bush isnt careful hes going to fall into the same 
trap which ensnared jimmy carter and ronald reagan 
the president has come dangerously close to becoming a hostage 
to the hostage situation in the middle east 
thats what happened to jimmy carter distorting his presidency 
and sending him packing for georgia and thats what happened to 
ronald reagan in his second term resulting in the legal abuses and 
policy disasters of the irancontra affair 
it could happen again unless president bush and his 
advisers handle the situation adroitly they could find themselves 
doing nothing more than reacting to an agenda set by a group of 
terrorists in beirut 
what the president must do instead is make clear american 
outrage over the murder of lt col william r higgins and the 
death threats made against other hostages make clear that the 
united states will not deal with barbarians and criminals and keep 
his mouth shut about when or where or in what form retribution will 
come 
a patient steady course is the right one a course determined 
by american interests and a firm resolve to see justice done 
the alternative is to let a band of criminals in lebanon 
indirectly seize control of this countrys foreign policy

los angeles times on the hostage swap negotiations 
what initially had been proferred as a more or less 
straightforward swap of a radical lebanese shiite cleric abducted 
by israel for three of its captured servicemen is showing 
signs of evolving into a multidimensional international bargaining 
session of great complexity and perhaps long duration 
as richard w murphy formerly one of the state departments top 
middle east experts so aptly put it over the weekend the bazaar 
is open and the offers counteroffers threats and ultimatums 
are starting to be heard from all sides 
it could be encouraging if it means that iran and syria are 
finally ready to use their influence which means apply pressure 
on hezbollah the radical shiite group that holds the western 
hostages 
at the same time the direct involvment of outside forces each 
with its own priorities promises to complicate any confidential 
negotiations aimed at pulling off a prisoner swap 
complicating things still further are the family ties that 
account for at least some of the hostagetaking in lebanon many of 
the 17 shiites jailed in kuwait for attacks on the us and french 
embassies for example are related to a single lebanese 
hostagetaking clan whose one demand from the beginning has been 
for their release 
if indeed behindthescenes efforts are under way to construct 
a grand exchange a lot of countries and a lot of parties will have 
to be involved its going to be a hard and probably lengthy 
business and given the disparate interests involved the outcome 
can by no means be taken for granted

the daily republic mitchell sd on the mandatory retirement 
of pilots 
united flight 232 captain al haynes did a great job of bringing 
home an uncontrollable plane although he claims hes no hero his 
years of experience resulted in the salvation of 185 lives 
however in two years haynes will be forced to end his career 
following 35 years of service a 29yearold nonsensical federal 
aviation administration rule requires 60yearold pilots to hand 
over their licenses 
behind this mandate is a concern that pilots over 60 may be a 
health risk with increased chances for a heart attack or stroke 
we however agree with donald engen former administrator of 
the faa when he said when push comes to shove when everything 
turns to worms experience is what really counts

thanks to sen bob dole farmers hurting from the drought or

doles compromise on the disasteraid bill made the measure 
acceptable to both democrats and president bush that is no small 
feat 
to satisfy administration concerns dole keyed payments to 
participation in crop insurance programs the plan is more generous 
in payments to farmers who buy protection 
perhaps dole will spark a new trend toward compromise with his

grants pass ore daily courier on the federal drug war 
if there were any drug lords quaking over federal officials 
declared war on drugs the news of the past week should have calmed 
their fears 
the senate voted to throw the drug soldiers a 17 billion 
bone snipping that meager amount off the huge 295 billions 
defense budget 
meanwhile drug czar william j bennetts draft of a 
national strategy to fight drugs the final version of which is due 
sept 5 is vague and gives little attention to dangerous drugs 
such as methamphetamine according to administration officials who 
have seen it 
it calls for an allout war on marijuana marijuana hardly 
packs the punch or attracts the guntoting people meth and heroin 
do 
bennetts tentative plans according to officials call for 
taking away educational and highway funds if states dont teach the 
antidrug classes or yank the licenses of drivers convicted of drug 
offenses 
lets hope bennetts strategy turns into a comprehensive plan 
that provides help not just threats for the states

the portsmouth nh herald on oil spill prevention and 
legislation 
the exxon valdez is safely berthed in san diego for the next 
nine months but the oil issue itself will be with us for much 
longer than that 
the senate for example is nearing approval of a bill to 
greatly increase the oil industrys liability for spills and to 
establish a 1 billion cleanup fund and disaster response teams 
along the nations coast more legislation more studies and more 
attention can be expected 
an internal coast guard study recently released by the house 
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy once again raises 
the issue of double hulling for tankers 
the study criticizes the singlebottom structure of the exxon 
valdez double bottoms the study maintains are effective in 
reducing the potential oil outflow from grounding 
tanker transportation may indeed require different safety 
precautions depending on the nature of the cargo and the sea to be 
sailed not debatable is the need for enforceable precautions they 
should be a matter of law 
the oil industry the coast guard and congress must work to 
agree on safety measures to protect the nations waterways delay

vicksburg miss evening post on capital gains taxes 
they laughed when george bush campaigned last year in favor of 
lowering capital gains taxes democrats claimed it was just a way 
to feather the nests of the wealthy and since they control both 
houses of congress that was supposedly it 
but lo and behold a majority of the key house ways and means 
committee lined up the other day in favor of a bill to reduce the 
tax people owe on the gains they make on the sale of stocks and 
other assets such capital gains are now taxed the same as ordinary 
income at rates of 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent depending 
on total income 
president bush has proposed a top capital gains rate of 15 
percent he may not get that rep ed jenkins dga has 
introduced a bill that would have a maximum 20 percent rate for two 
years and then a 28 percent rate 
a bare majority of the committee 13 republicans and six 
democrats support the jenkins measure both proposals would lower 
taxes for about 79 million couples or individuals 
democratic leaders are accusing president bush of trying to 
dismantle the 1986 tax reform law this measure changed the 
favorable treatment of capital gains to make them conform with 
ordinary income 
but the administration offers compelling arguments that giving 
taxpayers a break on such gains will boost the economy it would 
encourage savings and reduce costs of investment for us business 
it also would afford a hefty boost in revenues next year as 
investors moved to realize capital gains on assets that otherwise 
would remain untaxed this would help ease the stilltroubling 
deficit problems 
such factors plus the definite boost to the economy offer 
persuasive evidence on the need for more favorable treatment of 
capital gains

las cruces nm sunnews on savings by americans 
americans dont save enough and that poses a serious and 
longrange problem this fall the bush administration plans to 
begin a campaign to urge all of us to salt away more of our 
earnings 
in 1987 the personal savings rate sank to a 40year low of 32 
percent last year saw only slight improvement 
we predict an upturn in the savings rate regardless of the 
degree of success of the administrations urging the baby boom 
generation is now moving into middle age middle age is the peak 
period for saving earnings are at a peak at the same time the need 
for saving grows increasingly apparent 
taking the long view savings must be encouraged if they are 
not america will almost surely see its standing among the leading 
industrial nations further eroded savings means investment 
investment means new businesses and new businesses mean new jobs 
but its going to take some doing it wont be easy to change 
americans from big spenders to frugal pennypinchers who have 
relearned the adage a penny saved is a penny earned

nonestonian factory and transit workers went on 
strike today in the estonian capital to protest a new law adopted 
with nationalist support to tighten residency requirements for 
elections 
the strike is against yesterdays decision which the workers 
consider discriminatory said yevgeny kogan an ethnic russian 
and leader of intermovement the group is championing the 
interests of russians and other nonestonians in this small baltic 
republic 
the law passed tuesday by the republics supreme soviet or 
parliament requires residents to live in their district for two 
years or anywhere in estonia for five years before they are allowed 
to vote candidates for elective office must live in the same place 
for five years or in estonia for 10 years 
the official soviet news agency tass said workers in tallinn 
were not unloading freight trains or airplanes and that some auto 
transport workers also were on strike air freight was paralyzed 
it said 
kogan speaking in a telephone interview from tallinn said the 
elamo construction enterprise the dvigatel motor works and the 
kalinin electronics plant were on strike 
he said workers had struck at least 17 sites but he could not 
give a figure for how many people had walked off their jobs tass 
said workers at 19 sites were on strike 
ethnic estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the 
population and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx 
of other nationalities 
but russians who make up about a third of estonias 16 million 
people charge that the law discriminates against nonestonians 
because they tend to be more recent arrivals 
the law guarantees general voting rights to practically all 
citizens of estonian nationality and deprives tens of thousands of 
people of other nationalities the government daily izvestia 
quoted a deputy identified as a lukoshkin telling the estonian 
supreme soviet on tuesday 
nonestonian workers conducted a warning strike in late july but 
ended it when the government agreed to form a commission to look 
into their complaints 
now tass said the strikers want the kremlin to set up a 
commission to look broadly into estonias drive for greater local 
control 
estonia has adopted a series of measures to increase its local 
autonomy and protect ethnic estonians the republic has won 
approval from moscow to launch a new economic policy that estonian 
leaders say will even allow the republic to issue its own currency

saks fifth avenue has agreed to 
settle a suit the legal variety by tailoring its policy on 
alterations 
the department store chain said tuesday it will offer free 
alterations on skirts and dresses as it does already on suits 
blazers and slacks 
the action settles a sexdiscrimination suit filed by feminist 
attorney gloria allred on behalf of two women charged 40 each for 
alterations on dresses the suit demanded saks charge equally for 
altering mens and womens clothes 
we are now adding several free alterations on dresses and 
skirts and we will continue to review the policy for similar 
appropriate revisions said patricia fox spokeswoman for the 
saks fifth avenue store in costa mesa 
saks also agreed to pay the plaintiffs nearly 25000 in legal 
fees allred said 
at the same time the store chain insisted its previous policy 
was fair saks has never had a double standard so it cant agree 
to end one said bill acton spokesman for saks which has 45 
stores nationwide 
acton said saks had charged for altering dresses and skirts 
because they involve more work than mens clothing there was no 
charge for minor alterations to clothing considered unisex 
such as blazers and slacks 
allred lauded saks as sensitive to issues that affect women 
and said the stores response to the suit could serve as a model 
for the industry 
women cannot afford to pay more for alterations than men must 
pay she said charging them more solely on account of their 
sex is economically damaging both to their bank accounts and to 
their dignity

here is the text of hezbollahs statement 
wednesday on the western hostages it was translated from arabic by 
the associated press 
in the almightys name 
the zionist enemy has suffered bitter dismay because of his 
failure to achieve his obectives from the crime of abducting sheik 
abdul karim obeid and his relatives from the struggling town of 
jibchit the terrorist crime of piracy 
it is clear that things have backfired on the enemy after his 
foolish crime it has become impossible to release the israeli pows 
and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked 
moreover the refusal of the enemy to release sheik obeid and 
his two relatives and his linkage to the problem of the zionisventures 
over the last 58 years in the delightful jean de 
brunhoff books 
babar the movie brings the exploits of babar queen 
celeste their children and their friends to the screen it is a 
tale within a tale babar tells his four children the story about 
how he celeste and zephir the monkey outwitted rataxes who was 
trying to conquer the elephants 
the rhinos dont respect others they just trust violence and 
force said laurent de brunhoff who continues the series of 
babar books created by his father in 1931 babar respects the 
other one and always tries to find a clever way to solve a problem 
without using force 
the film has a lot of action in the book its a totally 
different way of looking or listening to the story you can take 
your time and dream in the film youre passive so the action has 
to go on the screen more intensely 
dozens of babar books are in print including the travels of 
babar babar and the professor and the one that started it 
all the story of babar in which the young elephant is crowned 
king 
babars admirers even include many adults such as childrens 
author maurice sendak who once wrote if he had come my way how 
i would have welcomed that little elephant and smothered him with 
affection 
i think every kid likes elephants de brunhoff said in an 
interview they may not like them in the same way as teddy bears 
or rabbits but elephants are funny because of their trunks to 
have this elephant living like a man is very very funny its 
possible for the kid to assimilate himself to the elephant 
de brunhoff does not avoid the darker side of life babar is an 
orphan his mother was killed by a hunter in the first book and 
in the film the rhinos capture the adult elephants leaving their 
children behind weeping de brunhoff insisted that showing pain 
was essential 
children like to be in the middle of a drama he said 
its not traumatic they just react with emotion as long as the 
good win and evil is the loser i think its fine 
its bad when it becomes sadistic otherwise i think its 
wrong that only sweetness is good for the kids 
de brunhoff who grew up in france was introduced to babar the 
same way as most children through a bedtime story in 1931 when 
he was 6 years old his mother told him about a little elephant de 
brunhoff and his younger brother mathieu were so taken in they 
repeated the story to their father a painter at the time 
jean de brunhoff quickly filled in details naming the elephant 
babar and creating celeste zephir and the old lady who takes 
care of young babar after his mother is killed 
he did a book for us with pictures laurent de brunhoff 
recalled 
he enjoyed the story a lot and everybody in the family liked 
it too i happened to have two uncles in publishing so the book 
was published and was a success my father made a second and third 
book and so on 
but in 1937 jean de brunhoff died of tuberculosis at the 
urging of his uncles 13yearold laurent completed two books 
unfinished by his father and eventually devoted himself fulltime to 
babar 
after world war ii i was working as a painter de brunhoff 
said the idea of making a book occurred to me because i loved 
babar he was my friend the idea was appealing and i tried to get 
close to the style of my father 
laurent eventually added some of his own touches notably using 
his niece as the basis for one of babars daughters a resident of 
connecticut since 1985 de brunhoff is at work on brand new babar 
stories for an upcoming hbo series on cabletelevision 
there are times when you have nothing to write about but 
something always comes youre traveling in the countryside 
fishing or meeting somebody youre interested in maybe someone 
tells a joke he said 
i have my studio in the house and a wall where i put some 
sketches when im working i also have one or two posters in my 
study but i dont like to be overwhelmed

in another confrontation between us 
and panamanian forces marines disarmed a group of panamanian 
soldiers and civilians who followed the marines into an area the 
united states controls 
the group of 29 panamanians including 10 military officers and 
lowerranking soldiers was briefly detained and then released 
after tuesdays incident said mercedes morris a spokeswoman for 
the us southern command 
she said the soldiers included maj manuel sieiro 
brotherinlaw of manuel antonio noriega the head of the 
panamanian defense forces and panamas de facto leader sieiro 
commands the chorrera military zone where the incident occurred 
a local mayor said the panamanians began following the americans 
after the marines encountered an antiamerican demonstration the 
progovernment news media had called the american maneuvers a 
provocation 
ms morris said the incident occurred west of this capital city 
when about 40 us marines in armored vehicles were carrying out a 
reconnaissance exercise on roads leading to the panama canal 
she said the panamanians ventured without authorization into a 
military zone reserved exclusively for american forces 
ms morris said the panamanians were disarmed and held for about 
an hour and 15 minutes she said their weapons including machine 
guns and rifles will be returned to the panamanian defense forces 
five panamanian journalists were in the detained group but they 
refused comment 
there was no report of any panamanian resistance 
a series of such minor incidents have been occurring since 
february 1988 when two federal grand juries in florida indicted 
noriega on drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges 
the united states has been trying to use economic sanctions and 
diplomatic pressure to force out noriega 
most of the panamanianamerican incidents have involved exchange 
of a few shots during the night or the arrest of americans accused 
of traffic violations

nonestonian factory and transit workers walked 
off their jobs in the estonian capital of tallinn on wednesday to 
protest a new law that tightens residency requirements for voting 
and holding elected office 
the strike is against yesterdays decision which the workers 
consider discriminatory said yevgeny kogan an ethnic russian 
and leader of the intermovement group that is pushing the interests 
of russians and other nonestonians in the baltic republic 
im concerned about my children and grandchildren said 
nikolai chugunov 42 one of those on strike at the kalinin 
electronics factory 
they started with a language law and then its something 
else and et cetera et cetera et cetera said chugunov a 
33yearresident of tallinn who wont be affected by the tighter 
residency requirements 
the strikers sent a committee of four to moscow to seek a 
meeting with vice president anatoly i lukyanov chugunov said 
chugunov a member of the strike committee said thousands of 
workers were on strike at 20 enterprises in tallinn and two in 
kokhtlajarve an industrial city east of tallinn 
he could not give the total number of strikers but he said that 
at some of the largest factories 3000 or more workers were off 
the job pickets blocked the entrances to the factories 
kogan a deputy to the national congress of peoples deputies 
parliament said in a telephone interview from tallinn that in 
addition the elamo construction enterprise the dvigatel motor 
works and the fishing port also were affected 
paab kaala an editor for official estonian radio said he could 
not estimate the number of strikers but said the strike committee 
overstated the number of strikers by several times when it 
conducted a warning strike in late july 
the tass news agency said workers were not unloading freight 
trains and air freight was paralyzed many tallinn bus drivers 
also walked out but officials brought in buses from other cities 
and kept public transportation running 
no disturbances or demonstrations were reported on the streets 
kaala said there were no appeals from the government for the 
workers to return to their jobs or any other official statements 
about the strike 
nonestonians were protesting passage of a law by the republics 
supreme soviet or parliament on tuesday requiring residents to 
live in their district for two years or anywhere in estonia for 
five years before they be allowed to vote 
candidates for elective office must live in the same place for 
five years or in estonia for 10 years 
ethnic estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the 
population and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx 
of other nationalities 
but russians who make up about a third of estonias 16 million 
people charge that the law discriminates against nonestonians who 
tend to be recent arrivals 
the law guarantees general voting rights to practically all 
citizens of estonian nationality and deprives tens of thousands of 
people of other nationalities the national daily izvestia quoted 
deputy a lukoshkin telling the estonian supreme soviet on tuesday 
the warning strike in late july ended when the government agreed 
to form a commission to look into their complaints 
now tass said the strikers are demanding that the kremlin set 
up a commission to look broadly into estonias drive for greater 
local control 
estonia has become a laboratory for reforms and the republic 
has won approval from moscow to launch a new economic policy that 
estonian leaders say will even allow it to issue its own currency

red flag lightning warnings that went up over the weekend in 
the northwest 
firefighters reported progress against dozens of mostly 
lightningcaused blazes in idaho washington oregon utah and 
california 
the temperatures have been lowering the humidity has been 
coming up said rebecca burkhead of the boise interagency fire 
center the nations wildfire command post thats really given 
us a handle on a lot of the fires 
the fire center replaced its longrunning forecast for dry 
lightning with a prediction of showers lower temperatures and 
higher humidity across the west 
still 23000 firefighters were battling blazes on 160000 acres 
of timber and range more than 220000 acres have been charred in 
mostly lightningcaused fires since july 26 
western and central idaho were still the hardest hit with 15 
major forest fires burning out of control over 104000 acres about 
9200 firefighters in idaho including hundreds of military troops 
cut fire lines in the rain 
this by no means puts fires out and it can give people a 
false sense of security payette national forest supervisor sonny 
lasalle said but what it will do is give us the opportunity to 
get a lot of line built get some mopup done and increase the 
security around some of these fires 
about onethird of an inch of rain was reported tuesday at 
lowman a small mountain community 70 miles north of boise 
virtually leveled by fire 10 days earlier several dozen residents 
were allowed to return home 
bob and margie carrs house was spared but everything around it 
burned 
the quietness and the peacefulness will come back but the 
scenery is gone said carr it hurts to see this happen but 
its happened and you cant do a thing about it 
progress was reported 30 miles to the north where 2400 
firefighters including 600 soldiers from colorado battled the 
18400acre warm lake fire complex 
with higher humidity clearing the air of dense smoke army 
blackhawk helicopters supplemented forest service airpower on fires 
still threatening the small town of warren about 120 miles north 
of boise 
resource losses in idaho are estimated at more than 75 million 
since a july 26 lightning storm scored the states backcountry with 
40000 strikes which sparked hundreds of wildfires

summit fire in the hells canyon national recreation area on the 
border with oregon should be contained by thursday said thom 
corcoran of the northwest interagency coordinating center in 
portland ore 
about 3500 lightning strikes across oregon started several 
fires in the siskiyou national forest and a bureau of land 
management district in the southwest corner of the state but rain 
limited their size 
the biggest fire in eastern oregon the 23350acre canal fire 
was declared contained tuesday evening corcoran said 
calmer cooler weather helped firefighters contain washingtons 
largest wildfire a 2500acre blaze on the colville indian 
reservation

things are not always what they seem in the 
drug trade where a gas tank may also contain cocaine and a corn 
field may hide marijuana plants 
the barest outlines of those and other dealers methods of 
hiding drugs were listed in individual reports on drug trafficking 
presented by the nations 93 us attorneys to the justice 
department 
a philadelphia councilman said wednesday that constituents told 
him drug dealers were even using carrier pigeons to transport money 
and messages 
ortiz said the birds had been spotted flying in and out of a bar 
known to area residents as a hotbed for drugs 
when people begin talking in the community theyre probably 
right councilman angel l ortiz said in an interview its too 
farfetched to be made up 
the us attorneys who presented the report last week often 
deleted details so the strategies could not be copied 
david e wilson us attorney for western washington state 
told of cocaine or money carried from los angeles to seattle in a 
modified gas tank 
this modification consisted of the construction of a baffle 
within the tank whereby the left side of the tank was a separate 
compartment from the main tank wilsons report said this 
compartment was accessible only by removing a plate attached to the 
top of the gas tank and was not visible from under the car 
the fuel gauge operated normally wilson said but the vehicle 
had to make more stops than usual for gas 
even fields of corn may not be quite what they appear 
marijuana plants are intentionally surrounded by corn plants in 
kansas where a growing number of groups specialize in the 
cultivation and harvesting of higher grade marijuana said us 
attorney benjamin burgess jr 
in boston authorities last year found 190 pounds of asian 
heroin concealed in a bean sprout washing machine shipped from hong 
kong 
officials in philadelphia reported the seizure of more than 
2400 pounds of cocaine hidden inside a shipment of cartons labeled 
anchovies in salt water the cocaine was weighted and packaged 
so as to be virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding cans 
which actually contained anchovies said a report by 
philadelphiabased us attorney michael baylson 
also popular with drug dealers is strapping drugs to carriers 
bodies 
los angeles gang members strap crack under their clothes or send 
it on greyhound or united parcel service for transport to york 
pa according to us attorney james west of pennsylvanias middle 
district 
in hong kong authorities found spare fuel tanks loaded with 250 
pounds of heroin base on a trawler in 1984 
the same asian drug organization that used the fuel tanks also 
shipped heroin in ice buckets wall plaques and in a shipment of 
tshirts headed for new york that was seized in thailand in 
december 1986 according to us attorney andrew maloney of new 
yorks eastern district 
tapes and records produced by caribbean groups are sometimes 
used to transport contraband to north american record stores said 
western missouri us attorney thomas m larson 
drug dealers increasingly clever ways to deliver drugs and 
collect money are forcing the authorities to change their 
approach baylson said this week in an interview 
its becoming increasingly difficult to find large caches of 
drugs because dealers are adept at spreading it around he said

though many people have a strong aversion to 
maggots the parents of a 17yearold girl say the centuriesold 
practice of allowing the fly larvae to eat decaying human tissue 
may have saved their daughters legs 
my husband said lets go for it and shannon said lets go 
for it so we did and it worked patsy dillingham the patients 
mother said tuesday 
shannon dillingham became critically ill suddenly on may 10 and 
was taken from a clinic to childrens hospital in washington the 
next day 
doctors there diagnosed her illness as meningococcemia a 
bloodborne bacterial infection that caused heart failure kidney 
problems and diseased skin and eventually led to the amputation of 
part of one leg and the toes on the other foot 
dr alan fields of the hospital staff said antibiotics used to 
kill the bacteria released a powerful toxin in dillinghams 
circulatory system that caused blood clots reducing the flow of 
blood to her legs 
meanwhile the bacteria continued its direct attack on her skin 
rotting it from the inside out said her father thomas dillingham 
a poolesville town commissioner 
once shannons doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and 
her toes on the right foot they still were faced with cleaning the 
remaining skin so skin grafts could be done antibiotics did not 
work fast enough and paring the skin from her legs did not work 
well enough her doctors said 
with shannons tissue dying they needed to do something 
said patsy dillingham when they use surgery they take the live 
tissue as well as the dead tissue and they had taken so much that 
they wanted to avoid that at all cost all of her skin from the 
waist down was dying 
after a long search by the hospital and the dillinghams more 
than 1500 fly larvae were located in ohio on july 21 shannon 
watched as the insects so tiny she could barely seem them were 
released onto her legs and secured with tape 
at first they tickled when they put them in my nurse and i 
were laughing she said i could feel them moving everywhere 
after 36 hours doctors used a highpressure hose to wash them 
away by then the maggots had grown from less than onesixteenth 
inch in diameter to nearly as big around as the end of a little 
finger her father said 
its a gruesome issue but we know that it can work said 
dr thomas t provost chairman of the department of dermatology at 
johns hopkins hospital its clinically wellknown that maggots 
will eat the dead tissue while leaving healthy tissue intact 
maggots have been used for centuries to remove dead tissue from 
infected wounds said dr joel howell assistant professor of 
internal medicine and history at the university of michigan medical 
center in ann arbor 
when you have an infected wound youd rather have an animal 
like a maggot eat it up rather than letting the infectious 
tissue stay there howell said it was probably used more 
before antibiotics or when it was more difficult for people to get 
to surgery 
although the treatment has been used in the united states since 
at least the civil war provost said it has been used in modern 
times only as a last resort because of peoples aversion to the 
maggots 
it is really horrendous provost said and most physicians 
are reluctant to do it because it tends to be sensationalized 
but dillingham a former teacher of biology physiology and 
anatomy was familiar with the cleaning capabilities of the insects 
and encouraged his daughter to try it 
i just wanted to get out of the hospital said shannon who 
is senior class president and a member of the poolsville 
juniorsenior high school track team if the maggots meant i 
could get out sooner then i wanted them to use them 
shannons doctors are optimistic she will walk again with 
protheses 
the grafts have taken a hundred percent her mother said 
were on the home stretch now

the head of a social security advisory panel 
that starts work this week said wednesday the councils first 
mission is to tackle the financing of a health care system that 
faces new strains with the aging of the baby boom generation 
deborah steelman head of the advisory council on social 
security said the current health care system overlaps 
duplicates omits confuses and leaves many needy people without 
adequate care 
it is critical that we develop recommendations for a sound 
sustainable health care financing system one that delivers the 
benefits people need at a price we can all afford she said at a 
breakfast meeting with reporters 
the 13member advisory council holds its opening meeting on 
thursday and friday such a panel is appointed every four years to 
examine issues affecting the social security medicare and medicaid 
programs 
ms steelman said the council hopes to issue a draft report on 
health care financing by july 1990 and recommendations on the 
financing and role of social security benefits by december 1990 a 
final report to congress and the department of health and human 
services is due in january 1991 
ms steelman said the current medicare system is projected to 
be insolvent by early in the next century before the baby boom has 
even begun to enter retirement 
the smaller ranks of people in the generations following the 
baby boom will make it difficult for them to finance benefits for 
the bulge in retirees that precedes them she said 
meanwhile the current patchwork health care system and various 
proposals for reform leave patients in a wilderness of health 
care finance trying to figure out what theyre covered for what 
theyre not she said 
i think theres a growing consensus that we have followed the 
meandering path of health care financing just about as long as we 
can afford to ms steelman said i personally believe you 
cannot fix this system without starting over 
ms steelman said she is hopeful the panel will come up with new 
ideas on how to restructure the health care system saying the 
council can be very radical as it searches for solutions 
we can be the spurs in the side of the horse she said 
ms steelman a lawyer was a bush campaign adviser and is a 
former associate director of the office of management and budget

alto saxophonist benny carter playing and 
hearing his compositions at a concert on his 82nd birthday told 
the audience hes looking forward to a whole lot more 
carters alto saxophone style was elegant and tasteful at 
tuesday nights concert in alice tully hall it was the fourth 
concert of six in this years classical jazz at lincoln center 
series 
carters compositions and arrangements for the fletcher 
henderson and count basie bands were important in the development 
of big band swing 
however tuesdays concert was uneven pianist hank jones 
bassist ray brown and drummer bobby durham started tentatively 
with key largo carter joined them for blues in my heart 
ernestine anderson who couldnt get rid of a frog in her throat 
sang a tune that sounded countrywestern and another that called 
for a bossa nova beat the drums were too loud and the bass too 
soft 
every time the music began to capture a listeners attention 
the master of ceremonies brought the audience back down with long 
irrelevant remarks about the musicians 
after intermission dizzy gillespie joined the four and some 
starch entered the evening carter introduced carter gillespie 
inc which he said they recorded in 1976 it included a pretty 
melody for their duet easy money which followed swung and 
it was about time

two leading social scientists who tried in may to 
persuade chinese legislators to oust premier li peng were expelled 
wednesday from the communist party and fired from their research 
posts 
yan jiaqi who fled to the west and bao zunxin who is believed 
to have been arrested are the first party members to be expelled 
in the crackdown on dissent that has followed the june 34 army 
attack on student prodemocracy protesters 
many other academics have been arrested or lost their jobs but 
even party general secretary zhao ziyang who was ousted from his 
party posts has been allowed for now to retain his party 
membership 
the official xinhua news agency said yan and bao were expelled 
because both had stubbornly clung to bourgeois liberalism over a 
long period of time bourgeois liberalism is chinas official 
phrase for westernstyle liberalism 
they also were fired from their research fellowships at the 
prestigious chinese academy of social sciences 
they joined in fanning and organizing the recent student 
unrest turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion xinhua said 
it accused yan who recently helped organize a chinese students 
group in the united states of continuing to plot against chinas 
leadership from abroad a warrant has been issued for yans arrest 
xinhua did not comment on baos whereabouts both are among 10 
authors whose works can no longer be published or sold 
since january they were prominent participants in an emergent 
democratic movement among intellectuals that was crushed when the 
army crushed the sevenweek student protests 
both signed petitions for the release of political prisoners 
and after the students began marching both spoke out in support 
they signed a may 17 declaration that said china was still ruled by 
an emperor a reference to senior leader deng xiaoping and 
published an article in a hong kong newspaper calling on chinas 
legislature to oust li 
in othere developments wednesday 
foreignlanguage newspapers went back on sale at beijing 
hotels after being banned nearly a month ago 
chinese newspapers continued to harshly criticize zhao the 
ousted party chief and said western concepts of human rights were 
irrelevant in china however li ruihuan the party official in 
charge of press and cultural control said the party still wanted 
exploration in art and literature 
hotel managers in beijing said they did not know why the 
staterun china national publications import and export co resumed 
delivering foreign newspapers this week 
they came as silently as they left said max wilhelm 
manager of the great wall sheraton he said company officials told 
him things have been settled but we never got a straight 
answer about what the problem was 
the publications company halted its deliveries in midjuly and 
seized copies of newspapers and magazines already on hotel racks 
hotels in other tourist cities were not affected 
most of beijings major hotels said newspaper delivery resumed 
on monday or tuesday but they did not receive any magazines or 
hong kongbased chineselanguage newspapers 
maybe the magazines will come tomorrow and maybe next week 
well get the television wilhelm said the government ordered 
hotels to cut their reception of foreign television including the 
usbased cable news network last month 
hotels are among the few places chinese have access to foreign 
publications that provide alternatives to the official line on the 
protests and crackdown 
chinas leading newspaper meanwhile heaped more criticism on 
zhao in a frontpage article the peoples daily accused zhao of 
using the pretext of adapting the party to new ideas to weaken 
its ideological stance 
the beijing daily ran a commentary arguing that chinas human 
rights policy is irrelevant because china rejects western 
definitions of human rights 
they make human rights out to be independent of society it 
said therefore it is a sacrifice any time the authority of the 
society race or country demands necessary limits on the authority 
of the individual they cry out that this is an invasion of human 
rights 
the commentary said that under marxism no human rights exist 
outside of or independent of society

strike planned for thursday 
andy dodds assistant general secretary of the national union of 
railwaymen and leaders of the associated society of locomotive 
engineers and firemen said they were pleased with the pay offer 
although it represented about onethird of what london underground 
drivers had been seeking for operating trains alone under a planned 
phaseout of rear guards 
under the mediated offer the undergrounds 2600 drivers will 
receive an extra 2710 weekly without having to boost 
productivity as management initially had demanded drivers had 
asked for an extra 104 a week 
guards will also receive a separate 970 a week raise in the 
deal 
union leaders said they were confident workers would be on their 
jobs thursday 
most of the pay raise would be paid beginning aug 1 and the 
rest on jan 1 when drivers will earn 539 a week 
a board appointed by the governments advisory conciliation and 
arbitration service last week mediated the agreement between 
management and unions as the 15th strike loomed 
the subway strikes have been one of the longestrunning 
stoppages during a summer of labor unrest which also hit passport 
offices railways londons doubledecker buses and other 
industries

civil rights leaders said wednesday it was 
kind of president bush to come talk at their conference but one 
added that its now time to dance with me prexy 
we set the clock yesterday when he started talking and we will 
run it until we get here next year john d jacob president of 
the national urban league told reporters at a news conference 
winding up a fourday convention here 
the rev joseph e lowery president of the southern christian 
leadership conference struck a similar note in a concluding 
address 
we heard mr bush say the right words now he must turn on the 
music and dance with me prexy he told delegates 
yesterdays meeting with the president would have been a lot 
different if he had some dependency on african american voters 
jacob said 
the truth of the matter is that george bush was being kind 
when he came here yesterday we didnt elect him and he knew that 
bush in his speech committed his administration to combatting 
discrimination but some delegates expressed disappointment that he 
did not comment on recent supreme court decisions that have eroded 
affirmative action 
we must call the administration to sacrament said lowery 
we must call it to deal realistically with the terrible problems 
we face today 
jacob said he believes republicans are making modest inroads 
among black voters but added if the republicans are really 
serious about attracting african americans they need to get some 
programs that deal with the problems concerns and aspirations of 
the african american community 
he said bush was the first president to participate in a 
national urban league conference in a nonelection year since jimmy 
carter in 1977 
this president has at least said that he is willing to debate 
the issues and work with us the urban league president said 
jacob said he believed the conference made headway in dealing 
with the issue of drugs which was high on its agenda 
i think this conference has made a major contribution through 
raising the consciousness level he said but also putting this 
organization on record as being at least one national organization 
that is african american that has publicly stated that it intends 
to wage war on drugs 
jacob said it was up to the government to stop drugs at the 
border and provide drug treatment programs but we can in our 
own neighborhoods help put the pushers in jail

i would have to admit its bureaucracy powers said of

initially asked for asylum at the airport but dropped that by the 
time he had a hearing april 11

nearly two weeks after us rep tommy 
robinson defected to the republicans a facsimile machine belonging 
to the arkansas democratic party was used to publicize a speech he 
was to make 
i see a little humor in that robinson said wednesday 
a news release sent by fax to the associated press on monday 
said robinson identified in the release as a republican would 
speak wednesday at the west little rock rotary club 
it said reporters could contact kip blakely for more information 
and gave a telephone number 
the number was for the headquarters of the state democratic 
party where blakely is executive director he is also in charge of 
rotary club publicity 
blakely confirmed wednesday that he sent the release 
it really is a real deal it did come from us im a member of 
that club and on the board and one of my responsibilities is 
advising the press we asked congressman robinson about three 
months ago to come and speak to us blakely said 
robinson switched from democrat to republican on july 28 saying 
he was no longer comfortable as a conservative southerner in his 
old party 
blakely said he saw no problem with using a democratic party fax 
machine to get news coverage for a republican and said he uses the 
machine to relay weekly releases about the rotary clubs guest 
speakers to newsrooms in little rock 
it was not like it was long distance blakely said adding 
that there was no cost to the party for the local call 
certainly i appreciate the free publicity robinson said 
but i dont know if that will put him in good standing with the 
democrats i think its a very kind gesture on their part to let 
people know about my speech by way of their fax machine 
i like kip blakely and i dont have anything against arkansas 
democrats one day they will make the same decision i have made 
robinson said wednesday 
blakely was joshed by ken coon chairman of the arkansas 
republican party 
we make mistakes ourselves sometimes i guess kip secretly 
wants to change coon said with a laugh wednesday i appreciate 
the publicity we need all the help we can get 
blakely said he joked about robinson during last weeks rotary 
meeting tongue in cheek i stood up and asked mr president 
whether it would be the honorable thing for the congressman to 
address us since we scheduled him when he was with one party and 
switched to another he said 
on tuesday robinson was introduced to a meeting of civic clubs 
at benton as a democrat tommy robinson 
the man giving the introduction said the information came 
directly from a biography supplied by robinsons office 
robinson replied with a grin i will check with my staff when 
i get back to the office this afternoon about the bio they sent 
out

president bush today pledged to pursue every 
diplomatic channel to win the release of the hostages in lebanon 
but vowed not to get involved in trading off or negotiating for 
hostages 
i hope i am openminded enough to talk and to exercise every 
diplomatic channel i can to free these americans bush said in a 
brief questionandanswer session in the oval office and no 
american is going to be content until these americans are free 
promising to pursue every avenue to win the release of the 
hostages bush said the lives of all of them are too precious for 
me to be sticking my head in the sand 
the president said some parties who have been ambivalent or 
silent on the hostage issue are now willing to help because they 
are so infuriated or angered or repulsed by a videotape 
purporting to show an american hostage hanging from a rope as well 
as by a death threat against another american 
there is a common thread this is too much enough is 
enough bush said 
bush was asked about his policy on dealing with hostage takers 
in the wake of a comment in an interview with the boston globe in 
which he said we do not negotiate in any way thats going to 
jeopardize the lives of other americans 
the administrations policy has been that the united states will 
talk with anyone but will not negotiate for the release of the 
hostages 
i dont think theres any subtle change from the position he 
took in 1986 when he led a task force that wrote a report on 
terrorism bush said 
im not going to do anything that would put some other 
american perhaps in some other place at some other time at 
risk bush said and that means trading off or negotiating for 
hostages 
discussing his policy on dealing with kidnappers particularly 
on whether the united states might release billions of dollars in 
frozen iranian assets bush said he would do nothing that will be 
seen a quid pro quo for hostages 
bush answered questions while posing in the oval office with 
cardinal bernard law the roman catholic leader of boston bush 
called on americans to say a prayer this weekend for the hostages 
and their families as well as for world peace 
the president said he wanted to be alert to any possible opening 
to win the hostages release i dont want to miss a signal he 
said 
bush has been described by his spokesman as cautiously 
optimistic but said in the globe interview he had no reason to 
believe the hostage problem would be solved in the immediate future 
he told reporters today ive never felt that the hostages 
would be here tomorrow but i hope they will i hope that something 
will happen 
earlier white house press secretary marlin fitzwater while 
saying there was no new policy acknowledged that the 
administration had come up with new language to give definition 
to the us stand 
in another development the wife of marine lt col william 
higgins said she is praying for bushs efforts to save the 
living us hostages in lebanon acknowledging that her husband 
almost certainly is dead 
robin higgins wearing her marine corps uniform and speaking in 
a calm and steady voice acknowledged for the first time tuesday it 
is a virtual certainty her husband is dead 
now is not the time for anger and bitterness for 
recrimination and blame 
now is the time for calm reflection now is the time to 
tell rich higgins that we love him and we miss him she said 
higgins was the commander of a un peacekeeping force in 
southern lebanon when he was abducted on feb 17 1988 
his shiite moslem kidnappers released a 30second videotape a 
week ago that purported to show him dangling by a rope bound and 
gagged the terrorists said the us officer was hanged in 
retaliation for israels kidnapping of sheik abdul karim obeid a 
moslem cleric 
mrs higgins a marine major is on leave from her job as a 
pentagon public affairs officer 
in her statement she made no mention of the grisly videotape 
released by her husbands kidnappers 
the fbi says it has concluded within a reasonable degree of 
medical certainty that the person depicted in the videotape was 
higgins but it released no information about the time or cause of 
death 
the bureaus analysis suggests higgins was killed in some other 
manner before the videotape was made according to an 
administration official who declined to be named publicly 
mrs higgins her hands shaking slightly as she read from her 
prepared text said she had been advised of the virtual 
certainty that my husband is dead by the marine commandant 
gen alfred gray she also noted she had received calls from the 
president 
i am also mindful of the fact that our president has agonized 
in a very profound and personal manner over my husbands fate 
she said he has my prayers and my support as he tries to save 
the living and end the suffering 
in her statement mrs higgins lauded her husband as a man of 
tolerance and dignity who served as a un peacekeeper because of 
a profound sense of duty 
rich went to lebanon in the service of the united nations 
because he believed he could be useful that he could help that he 
was needed mrs higgins said 
he wrote in his high school yearbook that his goal was always 
to make my family proud of me mrs higgins said he 
succeeded

2 years probation and fined her about 800 
prosecutor stephen wagstaffe told the judge mrs locasto should 
go to jail any consideration of keeping the family together

go away she said she found it hard to believe the infant had 
survived the ordeal 
mrs locastos husband louis locasto told authorities the 
couple had been having marital problems when alyssa was conceived 
and he had no idea his wife was pregnant

burmas military government has set up 
more regional military courts and extended martial law powers to 
junior army commanders according to an official burmese report 
the report issued tuesday came on the first anniversary of the 
beginning of a natiowide uprising for democracy which gen saw 
maung crushed in september after he took power 
a july 18 order empowered the commanders of the rangoon region 
and northwestern and central areas to establish military courts to 
try martial law violators these were already put into effect in 
the capital rangoon 
the new courts which can impose sentences ranging from three 
years in prison to death have now been set up in the northwestern 
and central military administrative districts the official radio 
rangoon said tuesday quoting new orders dated aug 2 a transcript 
of the report was available wednesday in bangkok 
the new orders also extended the authority to dispense martial 
law to junior commanders in both areas 
on aug 8 1988 tens of thousands of people took to the streets 
of rangoon to protest a quarter century of harsh socialist rule 
the following day troops shot and killed hundreds of unarmed 
protesters 
although saw maung has promised to hold multiparty elections 
next year martial law forbids open political dissent 
however western diplomats in rangoon reported a number of small 
protests by students who braved martial law to commemorate last 
years protests 
one diplomat reached by telephone from bangkok on wednesday 
quoted a witness who reported seeing a student clubbed on the head 
with a rifle butt tuesday troops at the time were reportedly 
dispersing about 70 demonstrators and 200 bystanders in the center 
of rangoon 
five people were arrested said the diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the diplomat said there were also reports from the northern city 
of mandalay that several thousand monks had mounted a protest 
tuesday 
he said groups of up to 300 monks walked in single file past 
heavy concentrations of troops brought into the city to ward off 
protests the action was interpreted as a pointed protest showing 
the feeling of the monks against the regime the diplomat said

the abyss could well be this summers most 
ambitious most problematic and finally most fascinating movie 
the abyss features no major stars and while the rest of the 
film season has unfolded nearly seamlessly this 43 million 
project was a magnet for miscues it missed its original release 
date by a month and because its rough cut ran 40 minutes long a 
number of important expository and spectacular effects scenes were 
cut 
but 20th century foxs the abyss finally arrived opening 
wednesday on 1550 screens 
the cast and crew of this technically uncompromising adventure 
movie endured 3 months of principal filming 40 percent of it 
underwater it stars ed harris the right stuff and mary 
elizabeth mastrantonio january man 
so elaborate is the films look and sound that almost everyone 
from director james cameron to sound mixer lee orloff labored seven 
days a week every week throughout the first half of 1989 
the final print of the abyss was completed just hours before 
its first media preview on july 28 the ringing sound of 
hysteria was always just around the corner said cameron the 
writer and director of such acclaimed and personal technothrillers 
as the terminator and aliens 
it seems t 
cut is a crucial sequence explaining that the storys underwater 
aliens are worried about nuclear war thats why the sub crashes 
the hurricane suddenly materializes and a now deleted tidalwave 
assault develops 
jim had a huge story to tell mastrantonio said and 
theres a whole lot thats been cut but given the time limitations 
of any normal film i think that hes told it cohesively 
cameron and hurd say too they have succeeded in assembling a 
persuasive and cautionary tale about common people facing uncommon 
circumstances 
a film should always try to take somebody somewhere whether 
its emotionally or physically transporting one to another place 
cameron said i see this as much of an emotional journey as a 
physical one 
the great thing about film is that you can really do anything 
you can show the biggest most spectacular thing in the world and 
in the next split second you can focus down to the most microcosmic 
human moment 
the ocean is for many people a great primal fear the 
director said its a very powerful thing it can be incredibly 
fickle weather and currents can turn on you instantly but its 
also the source of life and a place of incredible wonder

southern section of the san bernardino national forest was barely 
felt in nearby desert resort communities wednesday authorities

times greater 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage

the mother of a dominos pizza driver who 
was killed when his truck crashed has made a video for dominos 
franchise holders asking them to consider the hazards their drivers 
face trying to beat the clock 
its really to make an impact on them on the danger aspect 
and the safety aspect suzanne boutros said wednesday 
mrs boutros said she agreed to make the video when she and the 
pizzamaker came to an understanding after they agreed to 
disagree about the companys 30minute delivery guarantee that 
she has campaigned to have scrapped 
the video was shot at her home last weekend in anticipation of 
the companys annual meeting of franchise owners in detroit this 
week but spokesman ron hingst said it could not be edited in time 
instead it will be used as part of training materials for the 
company based at ann arbor mich he said 
the video evolved out of talks mrs boutros has had with company 
officials since the june 3 death of her son jesse colson 17 
his companyowned truck hit a utility pole along a wet highway 
near mooresville southeast of indianapolis he was delivering a 
pizza at the time and his mother believes the pressure to get it 
to the customer on time contributed to the accident 
dominos contacted me and we sat down and had some 
discusssion said mrs boutros a resident of suburban 
plainfield they had mentioned that the video as a possibility 
and would i be interested i thought it was some way i could make a 
contribution 
mrs boutros said the small amount she was paid for making the 
video would be used to buy a marker for her sons grave she would 
not say how much she was paid 
the people i have talked to are very sincere mrs boutros 
said that was a big factor why i decided to go ahead and work 
with them 
dominos has started an advertising campaign in which 21 million 
box lids are printed with a safety message from company president 
dave black 
in his message black says a dominos pizza is usually ready for 
delivery within 12 minutes of receipt of the order that leaves 
drivers 18 minutes to get to a customers home delivery areas 
average two miles or less black says 
incidentally if for some reason we miss our 30minute 
guarantee we pay the 3 refund never the delivery person black 
adds in the message 
dominos also asks its customers to call a tollfree number to 
report driving incidents involving company employees

the stock markets recent climb toward record 
highs is worrying some investors who wonder whether the elevation 
in stock prices will be followed by a plunge like the october 1987 
crash 
nearly a third of the paper value of stocks was wiped out in the 
crash and the weeks preceding it with the market on a path 
remarkably similar to the one it followed the months before the 
crash comparisons to 1987 are being drawn 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 418 points on 
tuesday to finish at 269917 approaching the record 272242 
close of aug 25 1987 today the dow was up 360 at 270277 at 
130 pm edt 
the current rallys apologists point to dissimilarities in 
market conditions between then and now that they contend should 
lead to a much happier outcome this time 
the current financial environment bears little resemblance to 
the fall of 1987 said michael sherman an analyst at the 
investment firm of shearson lehman hutton inc at that time 
longterm bond interest rates exceeded 10 percent and were rising 
today those rates are down near 8 percent and have been falling 
in the fall of 1987 the dollar was plunging to new lows so 
far this year the dollar has been rising 
in addition analysts say improvements in corporate health in 
the past two years may make a sharp downturn less likely corporate 
profits the traditional base on which stock prices rest have 
increased by as much as 65 to 70 percent 
in other words stock prices in relation to the earnings of the 
companies they represent appear nowhere near as overextended as 
they were in 1987 
the 30 stocks that make up the dow jones industrial average 
traded at about 20 times earnings in august 1987 lately this 
priceearnings ratio has been about 121 a much more moderate 
level by historical standards 
takeovers and buyouts of corporations which gave investors a 
reason to put extrahigh values on stocks before the crash are as 
rampant as ever in the 1989 marketplace 
bids for companies using borrowed money continue to put a burden 
of debt on the economy that worries skeptics who argue that many 
of the apparent lessons of the crash have been forgotten or ignored 
still active investors who watch their holdings rise in value 
because of buyout news or rumors find it hard to see the takeover 
trend in a negative light 
it seems there arent as many stocks to go around as there 
used to be observed thomas bailey chairman of the janus group 
of mutual funds in denver in a recent report to shareholders 
whats left is worth more 
professional traders engaged in largescale computer trading 
strategies often painted as primary villains during the crash 
also still are very much in evidence 
as in the early stages of 1987 they lately have been credited 
on several occasions with helping to drive stock prices higher 
through their socalled index arbitrage activity in a market 
downturn their critics say their presence could make things worse 
however one computerized strategy known as portfolio insurance 
has not made much of a comeback since the market collapse when it 
failed to deliver all its promised benefits as a hedging method 
thats the one good thing we could say about the crash 
declared raymond f devoe jr an analyst at legg mason wood walker 
inc it helped get rid of the portfolio insurance people 
should another overwhelming selloff hit the markets now a 
series of measures known as circuit breakers has been adopted 
since the crash that would provide for automatic trading halts at 
predetermined points 
it remains unknown how well these would work in practice 
whether halts in trading would help restore order or perversely 
work to prolong the agony hardly anybody is especially eager to 
find out

about 260 american dependents of us 
government personnel in china who were evacuated from that country 
two months ago have been authorized to return the state department 
said today 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the decision was 
based on an assessment that the security situation has improved in 
china but she said the state department is continuing to recommend 
that americans defer nonessential travel to china until further 
notice 
the dependents were ordered home on june 7 in the wake of 
indiscriminate firing by chinese troops on a compound for 
diplomats and other foreign residents 
the shooting incident prompted a strong us protest to chinese 
authorities ms tutwiler was unable to say whether the issue was 
resolved to the satisfaction of us officials 
the evacuation was ordered three days after protestors who had 
occupied tienanmen square in beijing for weeks were routed by 
chinese military forces 
other officials said almost all dependents of other foreign 
diplomatic missions have since returned to china in addition 
about 150 of the estimated 350 us businessmen who left china in 
june in china have returned they said

iran will help free western hostages if 
israel releases an abducted shiite moslem cleric and if four 
iranians missing in lebanon long thought to be dead are located 
a tehran newspaper said wednesday 
abrar the farsilanguage paper did not mention a condition set 
by the englishlanguage tehran times on tuesday freeing billions 
of dollars in iranian assets the united states froze a decade ago 
president bush said tuesday the assets which include arms and 
military equipment ordered before the fundamentalist shiite 
revolution could not be linked to the hostage issue sixteen 
western captives are held in lebanon including eight americans 
kayhan another iranian daily said wednesday that iran would 
rather wash its hands of its assets than compromise its 
ideological principles the official islamic republic news 
agency reported 
it quoted abrar as saying iran has repeatedly announced its 
readiness to exert its influence to help solve the hostage 
issue in response to any sign of goodwill by the west 
the four iranians are believed to have been killed when they 
disappeared in 1982 
president hashemi rafsanjani is seen as a pragmatist who wants 
improved relations with the west as a means of getting help to 
rebuild from the eightyear war with iraq he is opposed by the 
radical faction of interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi to which 
compromise with the west is anathema 
in the past rafsanjani has linked hostage releases the three 
iranians and a lebanese driver with an iranian passport who were 
kidnapped by christian militiamen in north lebanon in july 1982 
all four are believed dead iran iran wants the case 
investigated and publicized to show it too has been a victim of 
kidnappers 
israel kidnapped sheik abdul karim obeid 33 from his home in 
southern lebanon on july 28 it has offered to trade him and the 
estimated 300400 shiite prisoners it holds for three 3 israeli 
soldiers held in lebanon and the western hostages

as britain and the soviet union work toward a 
joint space venture two veteran pilots plan to link the two 
countries the oldfashioned way by balloon 
don cameron a recordbreaking balloon pilot said wednesday he 
will team up with lt gen gherman titov for the 1400mile trip 
from bristol in southwest england across the north sea denmark 
southern sweden and the baltic sea to leningrad 
titov 53 was the backup man for yuri gagarin the first man in 
space on april 12 1961 and titov became the worlds first 
multipleorbit astronaut by circling the earth 17 times in the 
spaceship vostok 2 on aug 67 1961 
were not trying to give the world a political message for 
doing our flight said cameron 50 its just an interesting 
sporting objective 
im one of the worlds great cowards so we have tried to 
remove as much of the risk as possible he added but its 
quite a long flight a lot of it over the sea 
depending on the weather the flight will begin as early as the 
second week of september and is expected to take four days 
the two men will travel beneath the 60000cubicfoot hot air 
balloon in a bright yellow 100pound gondola bristling with 
satellite navigational equipment and radios to communicate with 
camerons home base in bristol a soviet base and air traffic 
controllers 
titov who at 25 was the youngest person in space was selected 
by the soviets from among 200 volunteers for the balloon flight 
a similar process of weeding through volunteers was undertaken 
to select britains first cosmonaut for an eightday mission to the 
soviet space station mir in 1991 medical tests on 150 finalists 
began monday 
cameron has yet to meet his copilot 
titov has a tremendous amount of experience in many things 
but probably not ballooning he said ill take over for the 
takeoff and landing which are the tricky bits control in the air 
is fairly easy 
ive been learning little scraps of russian i dont know what 
titovs english is like but im sure well get by 
nonstop gas balloon flights between western europe and russia 
last took place around the turn of the century when count henry de 
la vaulx made several flights from paris in 1900 he smashed the 
longdistance balloon record by floating 1193 miles from paris to 
korosticheff in russia 
cameron claims to be the first balloonist to cross the sahara 
desert and the swiss alps in the early 1970s he lost out on the 
first successful transatlantic helium balloon crossing when his 
craft ditched 108 miles off the western french coast weeks later 
in july 1978 an american team set the record 
a balloon designer and manufacturer cameron approached soviet 
authorities two years ago and got the ok for his westeast 
adventure in july 1988 
a balloon factory that has since opened in moscow will begin 
turning out camerondesigned balloons by the end of the year to be 
used to carry tourists on sightseeing trips over historical sites 
in the soviet union he said 
later on wednesday a second britishsoviet balloon venture was 
announced by thunder and colt a british balloon manufacturer 
the company said it is building a hot air balloon for a flight 
from its headquarters at oswestry shropshire to minsk no date 
has been set for the flight which is still seeking financial 
sponsorship said chris kirby the companys marketing director 
the thunder and colt balloon would be flown by two british 
businessmen oliver holmes and richard barr the company said

as grave robbers go grandison harris was 
pretty good 
purchased as a slave in 1852 by the medical college of georgia 
harris was a resurrection man who dug up new graves in black 
cemeteries cracked open the crude wooden coffins bagged the 
contents and delivered them to the medical college for dissection 
by students 
a century after a law change that made the craft obsolete 
harris handiwork is coming to light as workers renovate the 
basement of the old medical college building 
this week about 40 boxes of bones from 19th century dissections 
were taken to atlanta to be studied at georgia state university for 
insights on the health nutrition and lifestyles of georgians in 
the 1800s campus officials are unsure how many bodies are in the 
boxes 
student volunteers also collected coins buttons bottles 
surgical instruments test tubes and clothing from the earthen 
basement of the 1835 building 
i can think of no other archaeological find in the us 
remotely like it said robert l blakely a georgia state 
university anthropologist there may be other medical colleges 
that have things like this in their cellars but they havent been 
discovered 
records by george m newton dean of faculty at the college in 
the mid1800s indicate that graverobbing was a booming business 
until 1887 when the laws changed 
graverobbing was often the only way medical schools could get 
around laws that equated human dissection with desecration 
newton bought 2000 gallons of whiskey in the 1850s and made 
references to transactions such as joe for subject 10 
the subjects were preserved in newtons whiskey until the 
time came for them to provide medical students vital lessons on the 
basics of human anatomy 
the bodies were mostly blacks because when you have a large 
population of a depressed class youre going to have fewer 
problems robbing their graves than the mayor of augusta said 
russell r moores a hematologist and historian of the medical 
college 
a manuscript on the resurrection mans career by the late lane 
allen a professor of anatomy at the college recounts how harris 
performed his job digging into graves by moonlight smashing the 
crude wooden coffins with an ax removing the subject and 
placing it in a sack which he carried to the college in a 
horsedrawn cart 
sometimes on his return harris would stop for a drink 
one tale recounts how a student once removed the corpse while 
harris was in the saloon and climbed in the sack he moaned in a 
ghostly voice when harris came back to the cart grandison im 
cold buy me a drink 
legend says harris replied get your own drink 
harris continued to work for the college after the civil war 
provided his freedom at a salary of 10 to 15 a month he retired 
as a janitor at the college in 1905 on a pension of 10 a month 
blakely said the georgia state researchers believe the bones 
will cover the entire period the medical college was in that 
building from the 1830s to the early 1900s 
blakely said the remains eventually will be returned to the 
medical college where they will be cremated next spring with the 
remains of current dissections and buried with them in an annual 
memorial service

gerald winsett a smalltown principal 
who has paddled hundreds of kids for discipline in 24 years as an 
educator was shocked when he opened a letter and read he is on 
floridas child abuser list 
he will appeal but if unsuccessful his name will remain for 50 
years on the state child abuse registry which is confidential but 
is used for staterequired screenings of daycare employees and 
other child caretakers 
im disappointed that something like this is happening 
winsett said in a telephone interview i dont think what i did 
was child abuse in any sense and when they say if a mark is left on 
24 hours theyre going to put you on the list thats nonsense 
winsett is among dozens of school administrators put on the 
abuser list in what an attorney contends is part of an unofficial 
effort by the state department of health and rehabilitative 
services to stop paddling in schools 
the list contains hundreds of thousands of names of child 
abusers and those suspected or accused of child abuse 
two unidentified middle school officials from north florida on 
monday asked the state supreme court to review a lower court 
decision upholding the state decision to put them on the list 
because of paddlings administered in 1987 the court is in recess 
until aug 31 
the lower courts 21 decision in april conflicts with 
comparable rulings elsewhere in florida that a bruise alone is 
insufficient evidence that a paddling has degenerated into abuse 
according to ron meyer general counsel to the florida teaching 
professionnational education association 
but for the existence of a bruise in the north florida cases 
there would be no indication of excessive force meyer said 
tuesday 
the state hrs department denies meyers allegation that it is 
singling out educators in its investigations 
we dont have a position on corporal punishment steve 
konicki an hrs spokesman said we do have a position on 
injury 
until this year state statute required local school districts 
to include paddling as a disciplinary option earlier this spring 
however lawmakers agreed to leave the decision at the local level 
since gov bob martinez signed the legislation in late june at 
least seven districts have banned paddling 
winsett principal of stambaugh middle school in the central 
florida town of auburndale and an administrator for 16 years said 
he has never been a strong advocate of paddling but that many 
parents in his area support it as a disciplinary measure he said 
he has paddled hundreds of youngsters 
a day or two after he paddled a teenage boy who had gotten into 
trouble repeatedly an hrs investigator asked winsett if he had 
paddled the student and asked about bruises left on the student 
winsett said 
weeks later winsett received a certified letter in june and 
found out that his name had been added to the list of confirmed 
child abuse cases 
that was ridiculous he said i just dont understand how 
anybody can do that in this country without a trial or anything 
i thought every man was innocent until proven guilty i never 
had a hearing but when i get the letter it says im a child 
abuser winsett said 
meyer said tuesday that floridas school administrators are 
frightened by an hrs trend he says began in mid1987 
its had a real chilling effect he said its a severe 
penalty to be labeled a child abuser 
but konicki said that only educators who go too far have any 
need for concern 
teachers in general dont feel under siege by hrs he said 
meyer estimated that 50 to 60 school employees throughout 
florida are trying to remove their names from the registry at 
least 10 exhausted administrative avenues and went to the courts 
none of those cases was pursued by police prosecutors or state 
licensing officials he said 
konicki said bruising is only one indicator of excessive force 
and added that its rare that a teacher is confirmed as a child 
abuser in cases where it is confirmed the bruises were not 
incidental but were severe deep bruises he said 
there are dozens and hundreds of teachers around this state 
that administer corporal punishment in a way that does not batter 
children konicki said 
wayne wallace senior human services specialist for hrs agreed 
every child bruises differently than any other child 
wallace said what the investigator has to determine is whether 
or not that bruise is the result of excessive corporal punishment

a suicide bomber attacked an israeli 
convoy in south lebanon on wednesday wounding six people in what 
the proiranian hezbollah called a down payment for israels 
abduction of a shiite moslem cleric 
hezbollah said a shiite clergyman drove the explosivesladen 
pickup truck 
it also said the seizure of sheik abdul karim obeid hampered 
efforts to free the 16 western captives in lebanon eight of whom 
are americans hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organization 
for groups holding most of the hostages 
in washington president bush promised to pursue every 
diplomatic channel to win freedom for te american hostages but 
said there would be no trading off or negotiating 
a tehran newspaper said iran would help free hostages if israel 
released obeid and if four iranians missing in lebanon since 1982 
believed long dead were located on tuesday another tehran paper 
said iran would help if washington released 2 billion in iranian 
assets frozen a decade ago when the us embassy was seized 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual adviser of 
hezbollah said of the bombing we tell israel this is a down 
payment much more will follow 
hezbollah whose name means party of god said the suicide 
bomber was sheik asaad birro a 24yearold lebanese shiite cleric 
from the bekaa valley israel said two people were in the pickup 
which exploded at midmorning in the buffer zone the israelis 
control just north of the border 
five israeli soldiers and a member of the allied south lebanon 
army militia were reported wounded 
uri lubrani israels coordinator for south lebanon said on 
middle east television the israelis would retaliate but did not 
say when or how 
israel will deal with the hezbollah as it deals with all the 
organizations which threaten the normal life of the security 
zone he said violence has two edges and israel will retaliate 
in one way or another in due time in a place it will choose 
sheik sobhi tofaili another hezbollah leader said there would 
be more attacks and the seizure of obeid would mushroom into an 
explosive volcano in the face of israel 
israeli commandos abducted obeid 33 and two aides from the 
southern lebanon village of jibchit on july 28 israel has offered 
to trade him and its estimated 300400 shiite prisoners for three 
israeli soldiers held in lebanon and the western hostages 
a statement released by the hezbollah information center 
described the seizure of obeid who was affiliated with the 
organization as a terrorist crime of piracy 
it reiterated previous rejections of the israeli exchange 
proposal israel has urged hostageholding factions to negotiate a 
trade through the international red cross 
the zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of his 
failure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting sheik 
abdul karim obeid the hezbollah statement said 
it is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy 
after this foolish crime it has become impossible to release the 
israeli pows and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked 
moreover the refusal of the enemy to release sheik obeid and 
his two relatives and his linkage of the problem of the zionist 
pows with that of the hostages might hurt the west and further 
complicate the hostage issue 
the statement said efforts for the release of the western 
hostages in lebanon are passing through their greatest setback 
because of the foolhardiness committed by the racist zionists who 
appear perfectly willing to sacrifice all others for their selfish 
interests 
hezbollah said the west should force israel to free obeid and 
described israels claims about statements the cleric made under 
interrogation as false and misleading 
officials in israel have said obeid confessed under 
interrogation to helping plan attacks on israel and the abduction 
feb 17 1988 of lt col william r higgins while he was on un 
duty in south lebanon 
higgins captors said they hanged the us marine officer july 
31 in retaliation for obeids abduction 
his wife and the fbi say they believe higgins is dead but the 
question of when he died has not been resolved some reports say he 
was killed last year 
a police spokesman in beirut said the car bombing was reported 
at 930 am 230 am edt on a road near the christian towns of 
marjayoun and qleiaa both 5 miles north of the israeli border 
israeli soldiers and the allied south lebanon army a 
predominantly christian militia patrol the zone which varies in 
depth from about 6 to 10 miles 
two jeeps a tank two armored personnel carriers and a 
halftrack made up the israeli convoy hezbollah said 
it released a color photograph of a birro the suicide driver 
behind a desk flanked by flags of hezbollah and iran behind him 
were a poster of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and ali khamenei who 
became irans spiritual leader after khomeini died in june 
hezbollah said the attack was carried out to declare our 
loyalty to the path of imam khomeini and his successor ayatollah 
khamenei

the government said wednesday that 
moslem guerrillas were violating islamic law by killing civilians 
with rocket attacks during the current holy month 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani criticized the 
guerrillas for calling themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors while rocketing the capital during the month of muharram 
they claim to be the advocates of islam and they pay no heed 
to these holy days and they fire rockets on civilian targets and 
houses and they claim they are trying to kill communists he said 
amani said moslems mourning the death of a grandson of the 
prophet mohammed during this month are not permitted to kill other 
moslems 
however moslems always are under a religious ban against 
killing other moslems 
rockets have been crashing into kabul almost daily since late 
june the sovietbacked marxist government blames the guerrillas 
for the attacks 
most of the rockets have struck civilian areas at least 281 
people have been killed and 745 injured in the rocket attacks and a 
car bombing according to un sources 
on wednesday no rockets were reported to have hit kabul 
intermittent thuds from government artillery could be heard 
however and missiles heading for targets outside the capital could 
be seen flashing across the sky 
amani said the guerrillas killed 16 civilians in a rocket 
barrage late tuesday 
one of 10 rockets hit a military weapons and ammunition depot in 
northwest kabul setting off a chain reaction of explosions that 
lasted for 3 hours 
un sources said one man who lived about 500 yards away was 
killed 
amani said 1200 people were evacuated from the area but he 
said the 16 casualties he reported were caused by rockets that hit 
elsewhere 
in other military action over the previous 24 hours air force 
planes destroyed a 1mile guerrilla arms convoy in logar province 
south of kabul amani said he said trucks that tried to return to 
pakistan where the most powerful rebel forces are headquartered 
were also destroyed 
amani had no further details and the report could not be 
independently confirmed

city money wont go to groups other 
than health clinics serving illegal aliens in an effort to 
discourage the immigrants from coming to costa mesa the city 
council decided 
the council agreed tuesday to withhold funds from such groups as 
boys and girls club the south orange county ymca the feedback 
foundation and opera pacific 
councilman orville amburgey said the city has become a mecca for 
illegal aliens taking advantage of the assistance programs 
we did some checking and found out the coyotes who guide 
illegal immigrants into the united states are telling them that if 
they come to costa mesa they can get employment food shelter and 
clothing amburgey said 
the 32 vote for the measure drew immediate criticism 
it is illadvised illconceived and very imprudent said 
rev jaime soto of the orange county coalition for immigrant 
rights it is really undue government interference into the 
affairs of voluntary agencies it seems a very uncivic spirit that 
motivates the policy 
the city gave more than 266000 in community development block 
grant funds and general revenue sharing funds to 30 organizations 
last year the city managers office said 
council member mary hornbuckle who voted against the decision 
said many nonprofit agencies budgets leave little room for 
expenditures to screen clients 
this will certainly create another headache said attorney 
rebecca jurado of the american civil liberties union it seems to 
be another tactic to get rid of illegal immigrants and is clearly 
going to be discriminatory

he immediately began trying to build public support by naming two

women voters angry over a new sales tax and a sex scandal 
involving kaifus predecessor were seen as a major factor in the 
liberal democratic partys poor showing in parliamentary elections 
july 23

the opposition socialists delayed kaifus election by supporting 
socialist party leader takako doi on wednesday the liberal 
democrats hold a majority in the more powerful lower house which 
chose kaifu under the constitution the lower house decision 
prevailed 
it was the first time in 41 years the chambers had clashed over 
leadership of the government 
today the door was only half opened but i am determined to 
continue to work to fully open this door some day said ms doi 
socialist secretarygeneral tsuruo yamaguchi told the associated 
press that politically the upper house vote has proven that this 
administration is only half an administration and kaifu is only 
half a prime minister 
kaifu told reporters the upper houses move was a severe 
consequence of our election defeat july 23 
there are many difficulties awaiting the liberal democratic 
party and i will try to work hard and express my frank feelings to 
the people he said 
kaifu became japans third prime minister in 10 weeks noboru 
takeshita resigned in june to take responsibility for an 
influencepeddling scandal involving the recruit co conglomerate 
his replacement sousuke uno stepped down after 69 days amid 
allegations he kept paid mistresses 
kaifu 58 considered a reformminded politician was chosen to 
lead the partys rebuilding efforts because of his relative youth 
and noninvolvement in the recruit scandal which tainted most 
senior leaders he was chosen party leader tuesday 
kaifu has acknowledged receiving about 110000 in political 
donations from recruit but said they were legal 
the company has been accused of giving political donations and 
selling bargainpriced stock to leading politicians in exchange for 
political favors 
kaifu was elected only to fill the remaining three months of 
takeshitas original term whether he can keep the post after 
october depends on how well he can establish a power base and 
brighten the partys image 
in addition to lacking his own power base in the party kaifu a 
former education minister has little experience in the crucial 
areas of foreign affairs and finance 
the 20member cabinet was carefully crafted to distribute posts 
among major party factions controlled by senior liberal democrats 
despite kaifus comment tuesday that factions are an evil 
his new cabinet includes the first woman nonpolitician to serve 
as a government minister sumiko takahara an economics specialist 
who became head of the economic planning agency another woman 
lawmaker mayumi moriyama will head the environment agency 
eiji suzuki head of the japan federation of employers 
associations told kyodo that two women in the cabinet would 
contribute significantly to the revitalization of the party 
homemakers were particularly incensed at the 3 percent sales tax 
passed in april 
five cabinet posts went to the largest party faction controlled 
by takeshita and four each to the next three largest factions 
ryutaro hashimoto most recently the liberal democrats 
secretarygeneral was named finance minister while hikaru 
matsunaga a former prosecutor was given the important post of 
international trade minister 
taro nakayama a former doctor was named foreign minister and 
former transport minister tokuo yamashita was named chief cabinet 
secretary the main government spokesman 
ichiro ozawa was named the new party secretarygeneral and 
shunjiro karasawa became the new chairman of the partys 
decisionmaking executive council both have acknowledged receiving 
legal donations from recruit 
opposition politicians reveled in the upper house rejection of 
kaifu calling on the liberal democrats to dissolve the lower house 
for new elections and scrap the new sales tax 
business leaders who traditionally support the liberal 
democrats urged the party to push forward with reforms

hospital officials said salameh was shot in the heart and quoted 
the boys family as saying a soldier on a rooftop had fired at him 
bannat died later of gunshot wounds to the stomach and chest the 
officials said 
the army spokesmans office confirmed salamehs death but said 
he was 8 the office said bannats body was taken from the hospital 
for burial before the army could confirm the cause of death and 
that it was checking further

the us economy is still growing but at a 
slower pace the federal reserve said wednesday in a report 
economists interpreted as an indication the central bank had room 
to cut interest rates further 
in a survey of economic conditions around the country the fed 
found that the nations economy continues to grow slowly with 
weak auto sales generally sluggish consumer spending and some 
declines in manufacturing output 
the slowdown this year was caused in part by a yearlong battle 
waged by the fed to drive interest rates higher as a way of 
dampening demand and cooling off inflationary pressures 
the fed switched course in june however and began nudging 
interest rates lower in an effort to keep the economy out of a 
recession 
many analysts interpreted the feds new economic survey as an 
indication that the central bank while not overly worried about an 
imminent economic downturn was ready to lower interest rates 
further if the economy showed continued weakness 
this report says that the fed believes the economy is slowing 
down but there is no imminent danger of a recession and inflation 
doesnt look like as big a problem as it did a few months ago 
said david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill 
wyss said that while the fed would ease interest rates further 
in coming months they are not in a big hurry to do it 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm noted that 
the bond market initially sagged when the report was released 
because traders had been anticipating a gloomier fed assessment of 
growth prospects evans said he believed the fed will still be 
pushing interest rates lower in coming months but only as 
inflationary pressures abate 
the economic reports and this outlook suggest that the feds 
soft landing has been achieved said evans the central bank has 
been trying to slow the economy enough to dampen inflationary 
pressures without toppling the country into a downturn 
fed interest rate decisions are made by the 12member federal 
open market committee composed of members of the fed board and the 
presidents of five of the 12 regional banks the policymakers meet 
eight times a year with the next session scheduled for aug 22 
to prepare for those meetings the fed surveys the regional 
banks about economic conditions in their areas wednesdays report 
known inside the fed as the beige book is the latest 
compilation of those views 
the report said retail sales were generally sluggish nationwide 
with auto sales below last years levels everywhere except texas a 
state where car sales have increased sharply about the only 
strength nationwide in consumer spending over the summer has come 
in sales of womens clothing the report said 
manufacturing activity varied from region to region with federal 
reserve banks in boston new york and cleveland reporting sluggish 
growth in new orders 
dallas and san francisco reported weakness in orders for 
electronic components while the chicago and st louis regions 
reported some layoffs and plant closings related to cutbacks in 
auto production 
lumber sales were being bolstered by foreign demand in the 
richmond and dallas fed districts but logging restrictions were 
hurting lumber producers in the pacific northwest and north central 
regions 
farmers were expecting good harvests in many parts of the nation 
but weather conditions were causing scattered problems such as 
excess rain hurting production in the south and a drought in north 
dakota likely lowering wheat yields in that state the report said

premier hun sen met wednesday with a 
un delegation and rejected a un role in resolving the cambodian 
war until the world body stops backing the guerrilla resistance 
the provietnamese leader and more than a dozen cabinet 
ministers and military chiefs held two hours of talks with the 
team sent by an international conference in paris on cambodia 
the team arrived monday to gather technical information for the 
possible formation of an international body to monitor the 
vietnamese troop withdrawal and a proposed truce vietnam has 
promised to pull all of its troops from cambodia by the end of 
september 
after the talks hun sen told reporters his government was 
helping the team because it did not want to block the peace 
process he said this did not mean his government had accepted a 
un role in the process 
we cannot accept the role of the united nations if the united 
nations continues to accept the role of the khmer rouge in any 
political issue of cambodia he said 
we shall study the role of the un if the un leaves the 
cambodian seat vacant he said 
the khmer rouge is the largest group in the threeparty 
guerrilla coalition that holds cambodias seat in the united 
nations 
hun sen said he rejected a guerrilla offer that the phnom penh 
government share the seat with the guerrillas 
i said that i cannot sit on the bloodied seat of democratic 
kampuchea he said using the name of the resistance government 
the paris talks which opened july 30 have not produced 
substantial progress because hun sen rejects guerrilla demands that 
the khmer rouge be included in a transitional government 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
before vietnam invaded in late 1978 ousted it from power and 
installed the current phnom penh government 
the 15member un team led by lt gen martin o datset of 
norway is to visit about eight provinces during its weeklong tour 
on wednesday the team visited northeastern stung treng 
province on tuesday it inspected what is expected to be a major 
route for vietnams pullout highway no 1 from phnom penh to 
vietnams southern ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
the team includes experts in aviation communications 
engineering and other fields they said the task of monitoring the 
pullout and supervising the peace would be complex in such an 
undeveloped country 
wing cmdr greg weekes an aviation expert from australia noted 
cambodia has few main highways and that many roads are impassable 
during the monsoon season 
another expert who requested anonymity said the scarcity of 
telephones and other communications would make it difficult to 
report truce violations 
he said the monitoring body must be much larger than the several 
hundred members suggested by hun sen if the predominantly jungle 
war is to be kept in check

completely confident i know what im doing hamblen said

korea before he was dishonorably discharged in 1953 he was married 
and divorced and spent 20 years in prison on rape and burglary

vice president dan quayle and his family 
like riding governmentowned horses at manassas national 
battlefield park but such vip privilege may harm the parks 
historical interpretive efforts employees say 
quayle and his three children tucker 15 benjamin 12 and 
corinne 10 are regular visitors to the park according to the 
vice presidents office the family is accompanied by secret 
services agents and local law enforcement officials 
they ride the parks nine horses normally used for park 
security patrols and not available for public use 
you have the vice president riding us government horses at a 
park that is designed for historical preservation and in which the 
staff is trying to control recreational use said former park 
historian john hennessey now with the new york state division of 
parks 
you have money going into maintaining these government horses 
while anyone can see the woeful condition of the rest of the 
operation what type of message does that send to the public 
park supervisor ken apschnikat said that while the parks horses 
are not for public use the visits by quayle and his family are a 
different situation and the use of national park facilities by 
members of the executive branch is common 
other guest riders have included interior secretary manuel lujan 
jr who has been riding twice according to park spokesman tom 
wilson 
david beckwith the vice presidents press secretary said he 
was unaware of complaints about the quayles horseback riding he 
enjoys it and says its quite beautiful beckwith said 
some park staff members and hennessey an expert on the civil 
war battles of first and second manassas see the vip trail rides 
principally as a symptom of a horse program thats grown larger 
than needed thus draining resources from interpretive services 
and preservation activities 
this is the worst year in the three years ive been here 
said ed raus who heads the battlefields interpretive staff we 
dont have the staff to operate the programs we once did it 
definitely has been frustrating 
the park site of the two bull run battles in which more than 
22000 soldiers died has had to scale back its interpretive 
programs 
raus said his departments budget has decreased from about 15 
percent to 11 percent of the parks 933000 budget this fiscal 
year the department has laid off three employees since 1988 and 
suspended some bus tours and living history exhibits 
new signs that tell the story of those who fought and died here 
in july 1861 and august 1862 sit in storage while the old system 
of recorded messages that explained what occurred at specific sites 
is mute 
people come in and say we cant understand what went on 
said robert e lee krick a history major working this summer as a 
park interpreter they ask wheres the bus tour from last year 
what happened to the voice boxes 
in addition battlefield sites are in need of repair 
apschnikat said the cutbacks stem from increases in the parks 
fixed operating costs especially salaries coupled with a 
1200acre expansion during the past five years 
park officials said it was impossible to determine the amount of 
time a specific ranger or other employee might spend on a 
horserelated project 
you see the horse program growing and growing and growing and 
everything else going down hill said park administrative officer 
jane becker you see things falling apart you must ask where is 
the money going

the government on wednesday appealed 
to east germans hoping to obtain exit visas to stop occupying west 
german embassies in eastern europe 
as many as 400 east germans were reported to be holed up in west 
germanys embassies in budapest and prague and at the permanent 
mission in east berlin 
the problem compelled bonn to close its mission in east berlin 
on tuesday 
chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf seiters said 
relations between east germany and west germany have been improving 
in the past year and that the refugee situation is creating more 
problems than it is solving 
a resolution of the problem has been complicated by the absence 
of many senior west german officials who are on vacation and by 
east germanys refusal to give exit visas to those occupying the 
embassies 
seiters pressed the west german view that east germans wanting 
to emigrate should seek legal means of leaving the country to avoid 
damaging relations between the nations 
he said the number of exit visas granted during the first six 
months of this year 46434 exceeds the number allowed to 
emigrate in all of 1988 
seiters also said the number of east germans granted visas for 
visits to west germany had increased by more than 9 percent this 
year 
but he said west german officials recognized that the desire 
to leave will decrease only when democratic advancements and 
reforms are in place in east germany and he said no immediate 
efforts in that direction were visible 
the west german appeal was issued after a special meeting of 
kohls cabinet early wednesday only five of the 19 federal 
ministers were present many senior bonn officials including kohl 
take their vacations in august 
due to the lack of a quorum the cabinet meeting was limited to 
advisory action 
intergerman affairs minister dorothee wilms has been criticized 
by west german newspapers for failing to return to bonn to deal 
with the refugee problem her spokesman said wednesday she was 
ending her vacation early and was heading back to the capital 
east germans began occupying the west german embassies nearly 
two weeks ago apparently out of frustration over the outlook for 
emigrating through official channels 
the east germans who numbered 131 at the east berlin mission 
when officials closed the premises have said they will not leave 
until they are promised exit visas for west germany 
seiters said the east berlin mission would be reopened only when 
the federal government could ensure normal operations 
the mission has functioned in place of a west german embassy 
since diplomatic relations were established between the two german 
states in 1974 
seiters said those at the closed east berlin mission would be 
allowed to stay until they decide voluntarily to leave 
mission spokesman eberhard grashoff said that as of midday 
wednesday none had left

president bush on wednesday urged all american 
churches and other places of faith to offer a special prayer 
this weekend for the hostages in lebanon and for world peace 
i just want to suggest that this weekend each in our own way 
that we say a prayer for the american hostages for their family 
and indeed for world peace said bush 
i believe in prayer said the president who delivered the 
plea at the outset of a private meeting with roman catholic 
cardinal bernard law of boston 
so i would ask the churches and other places of faith to say a 
special prayer this weekend said bush an episcopalian and 
regular churchgoer 
law later called it a wonderful thing 
the cardinal a personal friend of bushs said he offered a 
prayer before the private lunch with the president chief of staff 
john sununu and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
law said they discussed not only the terrible situation of the 
hostages but the broader issue of lebanon 
the hostage situation has to be seen in the context of the 
question of lebanon as a whole said law who expressed hope for 
a revival of the arab league efforts to end the factional strife 
and provide greater integrity of territory for the lebanese 
law said that in the past christians and moslems have been 
able to forge out a very unique kind of political experiment 
and live together in a political system that really was a model 
in lebanon 
law noted that large numbers of christians are fleeing beirut 
because of the shelling there and said if there isnt quickly 
some resolution to the lebanese situation then one would 
despair of that christian presence 
reporters asked the cardinal if he was optimistic about bushs 
diplomatic efforts to end the hostage crisis 
im in the business of hope im in the business of 
conversion so im never ready to assume that the status quo is 
it law replied with a smile 
law said bush had tentatively agreed to visit boston sept 23 to 
speak at a gathering of catholic lawyers and judges 
he said they also discussed events in central america and cuba 
a country law has visited several times 
law said that despite recent arrests of human rights activists 
in cuba he has seen progress in the communist island in the past 
five years toward wider freedom 
it does seem to me that cuba given its geographic location 
very naturally ought to be in good relationship with the united 
states said the cardinal

espionage for communist countries 
accounted for nearly threefourths of the 91 cases uncovered by 
swiss authorities in 198088 a government report said wednesday 
the cases involved 141 spies including 50 foreign diplomats 
one hundred of the spies caught or 71 percent were from the east 
bloc and other communist countries the report by the swiss federal 
prosecutors office said 
however it said the number of cases has fallen steadily after 
peaking at the start of the 1980s when warsaw pact countries 
resorted to economic espionage to counter a us ban on exports of 
high technology imposed after the soviet intervention of 
afghanistan

about 260 dependents of us government 
employees in china who were evacuated in june have been authorized 
to return because of improved security conditions the state 
department said wednesday 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that the state 
department nonetheless is continuing to recommend to americans that 
they defer nonessential travel to china 
she that the although the security situation has improved it is 
still more unsettled than before the imposition of martial law in 
may 
the dependents were ordered home three days after chinese 
military forces routed demonstrators who had occupied tienanmen 
square in beijing for weeks 
as part of the disturbances chinese troops fired their weapons 
in the vicinity of a compound where diplomats and other foreign 
residents live the us embassys chief of security said bullets 
flew through a window into a room where his two children were 
watching television 
the incident prompted a strong protest by the us embassy to 
chinese authorities ms tutwiler was unable to say whether the 
issue was resolved to the satisfaction of us officials 
at the time officials said the shooting appeared to come from 
the indiscriminate firing of troops who were attempting to clear 
chinese civilians from the streets 
the decision to send the dependents back to china contributed to 
the notion that uschinese relations are gradually normalizing 
secretary of state james a baker iii met late last month with 
chinas foreign minister during a visit to paris 
other officials insisting on anonymity said virtually all 
other foreign dependents who were evacuated in june have since 
returned to beijing they also said that of the 350 american 
businessmen who departed china about 150 have gone back 
the state department urged american visitors to china to take a 
number of precautions it said chinese authorities have seized 
religious and political materials they deem objectionable and it 
urged that americans refrain from going out after dark or 
photographing areas where disturbances have occurred

the fledgling parliamentary opposition 
said wednesday that said the communists had destroyed hungarian 
society in 42 years of rule but it offered to cooperate with party 
reformers after free elections 
members of the opposition hungarian democratic forum ruled out 
any coalition with the communist party before general elections 
planned next year 
but they said even a new government dominated by the forum and 
other opposition groups would likely include some communist 
ministers 
the forum counts among its members a tiny legislative caucus of 
three newly elected lawmakers the countrys onechamber 
legislature has 370 members 
we are trying to change a completely wrecked society to a new 
one declared istvan csurka a forum leader speaking to 
reporters at his organizations headquarters in budapest however 
he did not present a program of change 
two of the front legislators complained of interference by local 
communist officials during campaigning and voting in byelections 
saturday and on july 22 however they suggested the irregularities 
were the work of overzealous individuals not part of a larger 
plan 
while only a small fraction of hungarys electorate took part in 
the byelections opposition figures have viewed the results as an 
indication of communist weakness during next years general 
elections 
communist leaders who endorsed a multiparty system in february 
have sought to play down the defeat of their candidates pointing 
to low turnouts and claiming their campaigns were lowkey 
csurka was asked wednesday if he or other top forum officials 
were ready to become prime minister if the opposition won next 
years elections 
we will find the right man from our ranks for any 
responsibility he said 
but he said there will be and there must be some communists 
in the next hungarian government regardless of the election 
outcome 
forum spokesman csaba kiss put conditions on any postelection 
cooperation with the communists 
there can be no coalition if the key positions interior 
ministry foreign ministry finance ministry are seized by the 
communist party as in 1947 he told reporters hungary became a 
oneparty state that year 
in poland the opposition led by the labor union solidarity 
has refused to join the ruling communists in a coalition after 
solidarity scored a sweeping victory in june elections

analysts said israel may make a limited 
military response to wednesdays suicide bombing by the proiranian 
hezbollah despite the risk to diplomatic efforts aimed at ending 
the hostage crisis 
the government did not mention retaliation in its response to 
statements from beirut saying the suicide car bomb which wounded 
five israeli soldiers and an allied militiaman was a response to 
the abduction july 28 of sheik abdul karim obeid a hezbollah 
spiritual leader 
prime minister yitzhak shamir telephoned president bush as a way 
of achieving a better coordination between the israeli and us 
positions on hostages and prisoners of war said shamirs 
adviser avi pazner 
he described the 10minute conversation as very good and 
friendly he said shamir repeated israels position that it will 
free obeid only in exchange for the three israeli soldiers held in 
lebanon and all the hostages pazner would not give details of 
bushs replies 
sixteen western hostages are held in lebanon including eight 
americans 
an israeli government statment after the bombing said 
to our great sorrow another brutal attack was committed today 
close to our northern border this attack for which hezbollah 
assumed responsibility is another link in a long and bloody chain 
of attacks along this border which has been going on for many years 
this is another horrible reminder of the constant security 
problem along our northern border which unfortunately places israel 
on the frontline of the struggle against international terrorism 
israels coordinator for south lebanon uri lubrani said there 
would be retaliation eventually but he did not say when or what 
form it would take 
israel will deal with the hezbollah as it deals with all the 
organizations which threaten the normal life of the security 
zone he said violence has two edges and israel will retaliate 
in one way or another in due time in a place it will choose 
ariel merari a terrorism expert at tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies said in an interview that israel 
would be viewed as weak unless it retaliated 
an israeli retaliation would disrupt negotiations no more than 
this car bombing unless this becomes a trend a single israeli 
retaliation would not change anything he said 
he suggested the military response should be measured so as not 
to provoke a cycle of attack and counterattack 
i would recommend some type of strike or force in retaliation 
for this he said the only way to bring hezbollah to a 
hostage deal is to project force against force 
speaking on israeli tv military commentator ron benishai said 
in the past israel had used air raids to respond to such attacks 
even when israeli prisoners were threatened 
when we had a car bomb attack last year hezbollah threatened 
that if israel reacted it would harm israeli prisoners of war the 
army then made its calculations and the air force bombed hezbollah 
command headquarters he said 
the suicide car bomb in october 1988 claimed the lives of eight 
israeli soldiers and wounded seven others israel responded with 
three air raids and a ground assault in which 16 lebanese were 
killed and 40 wounded 
benishai also said israel risked being viewed as weak if it did 
not retaliate 
aharon levran a retired brigadier general and a commentator on 
military affairs said israel response would be moderate if a 
military option was chosen to punish hezbollah 
but he suggested israel might refrain from any military activity 
so as not to agitate world public opinion after the us 
criticism over israels abduction of obeid 
i would not be surprised if israel will swallow hard and do 
nothing israel does not want to disrupt the process of 
negotiations which has begun with sheik obeid he said in an 
interview 
if israel is going to punish hezbollah by launching reprisals 
it will be shooting itself in the foot it will not facilitate the 
exchange of prisoners he added 
israel abducted the shiite clergyman to try to prod hezbollah 
into agreeing to a prisoner exchange shiite radicals aligned with 
the group are believed to be holding three israeli servicemen 
captured in 1986 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has offered to exchange obeid and 
several hundred other shiite prisoners held in israeli jails for 
the israeli airman and two soldiers but rabin stressed tuesday 
that israel would not start negotiations until they had some sign 
of life from the pows

if et took a little ocean vacation with jules verne and 
dropped in for lunch with lloyd bridges and flipper maybe someone 
would make a movie out of it maybe it could even be called the 
abyss 
the 43 million 20th century fox summer spectacular is about as 
derivative as any movie can get james cameron who wrote and 
directed pulls a litany of movie formulas and gimmicks including 
a few from aliens which he also wrote and directed 
what redeems the abyss from being an et or aliens 
ripoff are some spectacular special effects and camera work 
deepcore a submersible oil rig is working not far from where a 
submarine armed with nuclear warheads has crashed in a 
fantastically deep trough the government commandeers the mother 
vessel orders deepcore to take on a group of navy seals and work 
with the divers to salvage the sub 
at the same time a hurricane rages above and an alien nation 
broods below it seems the hurricane was a little something the 
aliens whipped up to protest nuclear weapons the aliens who move 
faster than a speeding bullet and who are definitely more powerful 
than any locomotive also are responsible for the sub crash 
still they are friendly peaceloving little shards of light 
vaguely reminiscent of the ethereal creatures in ron howards 
cocoon 
deepcores crew is a lovable bunch of hardcore riggers led by 
bud brigman ed harris his estranged wife lindsey mary 
elizabeth mastrantonio designed the rig and brings down the seals 
for the salvage operation 
the seals have a definite attitude problem and their leader 
lt coffey michael biehn is certifiable 
the hurricane causes an abovewater crane to crash down on 
deepcore and drags it the brink of the underwater trough after 
communciation is severed with the mother ship coffey goes solo and 
decides to arm one of the subs nuclear warheads terminate the 
aliens and kill deepcores crew 
before his ultimate demise coffey manages to arm one of 
deepcores mini sea rovers called little geek with a nuclear 
warhead aimed straight into the trough at the alien nation 
the first twothirds of the abyss amount to a fairly good 
adventurethriller with lots of sparkling hip dialogue good 
character development and nonstop action the last third is a joke 
brigman decides to don a dive suit and go into the trough to 
follow little geek he uses a special experimental navy liquid mix 
as his breathing aparatus why does he go because its a dirty 
little job and somebody has to do it he says with a straight 
face this and other cliches pop up with astonishing frequency as 
the abyss begins its plunge into movie camp 
there are odd moments lindsey drowning in freezing water and 
then being revived by bud slapping her face and calling her names 
after adrenalin and shocks have failed a syrupy and trite lindsey 
confessing to all sorts of mistreatment to bud as he almost loses 
conciousness at depths no human has ever gone 
there are pure ripoffs an alien finger resembling little ets 
spindly appendage reaching out and touching a human much the same 
way as in et the extraterrestrial and michaelangelos 
ceiling in the sistine chapel 
but harris and mastrantonio are a good blend and the deepcore 
crew is an interesting lot thanks in part to howard feuers 
casting still its a formula group a strong woman who helps 
leads the crew from disaster a black a burly football type a 
comic who travels with his pet mouse a laidback guy named jammer 
who comes through when the going gets real rough 
mikael salomons photography is superb and the original music 
by alan silvestri has just the right taste of suspense and promise 
but in the end the abyss promises so much and delivers so 
little 
produced by gale anne hurd the abyss is rated pg13 for 
language and thrills

the government on wednesday listed 389 
charities including several controversial ones that will take 
part in a massive employee solicitation drive that raises about 
160 million a year from federal workers 
a homosexual group the lambda legal defense and educational 
fund is among 19 groups whose applications were included in the 
combined federal campaign after initially being turned down 
i assume frankly that there was simply a desire to keep 
lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission defending 
homosexuals and homosexual rights in court said executive director 
thomas stoddard 
frankly it is a thrilling prospect for us he said being 
listed helps fulfill our mission 
he said his was the first overtly homosexual group to win the 
right to participate he said he could not anticipate how much 
money would come to the group since designating it as a charitable 
recipience may be viewed by the employee as one degree of coming 
out the fund with a 1 million budget was established in 1972 
constance newman director of the office of personnel 
management said that after personally reviewing rejected 
applications she approved 19 rejected organizations gave 
qualified approval to eight left six pending and denied approval 
to 55 of which 33 had not complied with requests for additional 
information 
those given qualified approval for one year spend more than 25 
percent of their receipts on administrative and fundraising costs 
normally grounds for exclusion 
approval went to a range of causes some potentially 
controversial among them are the firearms civil rights legal 
defense fund the united palestinian appeal human life 
international the national association of black law enforcement 
executives united states military sports association the living 
bank and operation california 
antiabortion groups such as the national right to life 
educational trust fund and abortion rights groups such as the 
religious coalition for abortion rights education fund and planned 
parenthoodworld population already were listed so were such 
conservative groups as the national right to work legal defense 
foundation inc and such liberal outfits as people for the 
american way 
being listed can bring large amounts of money to an organization 
at virtually no cost or it can bring nothing if employees do not 
specifically designate the charity 
the fund drive raises over 160 million from 4 million federal 
employees including military people and postal workers with the 
average giving 6068 
it is the largest employee solicitation in the country opm 
said although americans individually gave 87 billion to churches 
and charities in 1988 according to the american association of 
fundraising counsel 
federal employees may designate up to five charities from a list 
that when local groups are included in some instances numbers as 
many as 1000 
about 80 percent of the gifts are designated of the rest about 
82 percent goes to the local united way campaign 7 percent to a 
group of 33 international service agencies 7 percent to national 
health agencies and 4 percent to local groups according to opm 
former president ronald reagan issued an executive order in 1983 
restricting the federal drive to traditional health and welfare 
charities but after protests and lawsuits by advocacy groups 
congress in 1986 enacted legislation broadening the grounds for 
admission but giving the opm director discretion

a federal appeals court has barred an army 
reserve sergeant from reenlisting because she is a lesbian saying 
sexual orientation is important for maintaining discipline and the 
integrity of command 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals reversed a lower court 
decision allowing miriam benshalom of milwaukee to rejoin the 
army reserve the army had refused to allow her to reenlist 
because of her professed homosexuality 
patrick berigan ms benshaloms attorney said she will 
appeal its our intent to keep up with the appeals and go as far 
as we can he said from his home in milwaukee 
tuesdays ruling reversed a january decision by us district 
judge myron gordon in milwaukee gordon said ms benshaloms first 
amendment rights to freedom of speech were violated by an army 
regulation barring homosexuals 
ruling on the armys appeal the threejudge appeals court panel 
found that while ms benshaloms declaration of homosexuality is 
speech it is also an acknowledgement of identification in a group 
it is the identity that makes her ineligible for military 
service not the speaking of it aloud judge harlington wood jr 
wrote in the decision thus if the armys regulation affects 
speech it does so only incidentally in the course of pursuing 
other legitimate goals 
the appellate court agreed with the armys argument that it 
needs to distinguish military personnel on the basis of sexual 
orientation to maintain discipline and preserve the integrity of 
rank and command 
the court also found that ms benshaloms 5th amendment right 
to equal protection under the law had not been violated 
ms benshalom was traveling in michigan and could not be 
reached for comment said a friend hope gentle contacted at ms 
benshaloms home in milwaukee 
john hoyle the justice department attorney who argued the case 
before the appellate court for the army declined to comment 
ms benshalom 40 was discharged from the army reserve in 1976 
after she said she was a lesbian after a series of court actions 
she was reinstated in september 1987 
ms benshalom applied to reenlist for a sixyear army reserve 
term last august gordon ordered the army to consider her 
reenlistment without regard to her homosexuality 
the army refused to let her rejoin but after gordon found the 
service in contempt of court in january ms benshalom was allowed 
to reenlist the action was however made conditional on the 
outcome of the armys appeal to the circuit court

a group that monitors childrens television 
asked the government wednesday to regulate paid telephone message 
services pitched to young viewers and said calls to such numbers 
can bring parents unexpectedly large telephone bills 
calling it a pocketbook issue rather than a free speech one 
action for childrens television requested the federal trade 
commission to restrict such 900number services 
its petition asks the ftc to require american telephone amp 
telegraph co to issue refunds on demand to parents for 
unauthorized calls made by their children make a blocking device 
available to parents and itemize telephone bills for child 
services 
the groups targets are the numbers advertised on childrens 
programs shown on independent stations during weekday afternoon 
hours when many latchkey children are at home but their 
parents are at work 
the 900 numbers invite children to talk to popular personalities 
and cartoon characters such as the tooth fairy mighty mouse or 
shera and heman and often offer products such as posters signs 
or shirts as enticements to call according to the act petition 
although children are told they will talk to a character 
they hear a recorded message instead the petition says 
in fact atampt says that any 900 service for which it consents to 
do the billing must be a recorded message it must also say what 
the call will cost tell children to ask for their parents 
permission and allow no funny technology such as the service 
that told children to hold the phone to the tv while it bleeped out 
tones 
a typical call to such a 900 number might cost 245 2 for 
the first minute and 45 cents for each additional minute 
andrea west atampts product marketing manager for 900 services 
said the company doesnt issue all 900 numbers although we have 
some sponsors that do provide programming with licensed 
characters 
licensed characters are those for whom the rights are owned by a 
company 
west said customers can contest their bills although atampt has no 
blanket policy on granting refunds she said regional phone company 
have the choice of offering itemized billing and in some instances 
do offer blocking devices 
atampt says it set its guidelines in concert with the 
regulatory guidelines of the childrens advertising review unit of 
the council of better business bureaus 
the act petition calls the atampt safeguards ineffective act 
president peggy charren said that although atampt may not issue all 
the numbers the ones they bill are the ones we are talking 
about 
the better business bureau unit that oversees childrens 
advertising says it does not encourage or endorse this form of 
advertising to children but is proposing guidelines 
robert h lorsch president and founder of teleline inc of 
beveraly hills calif one of the leading providers of such 
services said research shows that an average call lasts less than 
two minutes that children have asked their parents permission and 
that children who dont understand that the costs mount with the 
time they are on the phone probably couldnt make a call in the 
first place 
he said his company has worked closely with act and the business 
bureau to put out responsible programming

a group of children used a playground as 
headquarters for a makebelieve drug ring selling neatly packaged 
bags of sugar and grass clippings that looked like cocaine and 
marijuana police said wednesday 
i think the whole thing is very tragic normally they play 
fireman or policeman its tragic when they want to grow up and be 
drug dealers said city councilman peter zug 
authorities speculated that the children who were believed to 
be 12 or younger were either emulating their parents or being 
trained for the drug business 
i was shocked and depressed said detective thomas capello 
looking through a tackle box stacked with bogus drugs and colored 
slips of paper detailing the groups transactions 
i think they were doing this as a game with other kids but it 
was a very serious game capello said 
the tackle box was turned over to police last week after two 
children ages 7 and 9 found it in a tree at the dilapidated 
downtown playground which neighbors said had been closed for at 
least two years the playground in the city east of harrisburg 
borders an area of the city known for drug use officials said 
police had not interviewed any children in the case but said 
they had five names from reading ledger notes in the box and 
intended to speak with the youngsters thursday 
it was sophisticated packaging they were maintaining a list 
of buyers money spent and money owed i was totally shocked 
said chief michael deleo 
what concerns me is the age category were dealing with we 
must do something to save the next generation he said 
also in the tackle box was 52 cents and detailed lists of 
product prices and sizes on one slip cocaine was misspelled 
cocain a small bag of the bogus cocaine was priced at 55 
cents the small bags of grass clippings were priced at 1 
officials said the grass clipping and sugar were not illegal 
but selling them under the pretense of being drugs would be they 
said their primary concern was that the children receive counseling 
there absolutely needs to be discussions with them to teach 
them about drugs and the tragedy that can come from drugs zug 
said

police fired tear gas at hundreds 
of black protesters marching from a university campus in defiance 
of emergency regulations wednesday fifteen journalists were 
detained 
at least 1500 black students and other activists held a 
lunchtime rally at the mixedrace university of the western cape as 
part of a national campaign of defiance against emergency 
restrictions and apartheid laws 
the protests which have been marked by almost daily 
studentpolice clashes in the cape town area coincide with the 
campaign for sept 6 parliamentary elections the parliament 
excludes representatives of the black majority of 28 million 
after the rally police detained 15 reporters photographers and 
cameramen for foreign and local news organizations for about four 
hours they were placed in police vehicles and held outside the 
campus while police fired rounds of tear gas at the between 500 and 
600 people who marched off the university grounds after the rally 
the journalists were later taken to a police station and warned 
that they were under investigation for allegedly violating the 
3yearold emergency regulations that restrict press coverage of 
unrest enforcement of the press restrictions has not been 
comprehensive 
about 20 policemen were firing tear gas at random as the 
marchers with placards came about a quarter of the way across the 
road then moved back said a journalist who watched the events 
the police were firing tear gas over the cars passing on the 
road then they went onto the campus and fired tear gas all over 
it was not known whether any students were arrested or injured 
in the clash 
the argus a cape town newspaper said in an editorial wednesday 
that the defiance protests which began a week ago with black 
patients seeking treatment at white hospitals were gathering 
momentum 
the paper said organizations and individuals restricted under 
the 1986 emergency were refusing to meekly acquiesce in their own 
repression 
the governments response has been predictable said the 
argus it has furiously denounced the organizations leading the 
defiance and ordered a tough police response no doubt sensing 
that such handling of the situation could boost its flagging 
fortunes in the general election campaign 
the 924000member congress of south african trade unions is a 
leader of the defiance campaign despite a government decree that 
bans the organization from engaging in political activity 
the congress issued a statement wednesday mocking law and order 
minister adriaan vloks comment that he will investigate the labor 
federations breaking of the emergency restrictions 
what he will find is that the vast majority of rightthinking 
south africans have stopped observing the state of emergency long 
ago the statement said not only are these regulations 
incomprehensible and unenforceable but people do not regard 
themselves as bound by laws which they had no say in passing

a man arrested after a bank robbery said he 
committed a string of heists around the country while trailing 
george bush because voices told him to kill the president 
police said wednesday 
john spencer daughette a 34yearold transient reportedly told 
investigators he robbed the bank because he needed money to carry 
out his assassination plan 
he was going to get about 3000 to buy a motorcycle and go 
east and assassinate the president or kill some children said 
oakland police sgt greg bingham i believe with all my heart 
from talking to him he would have done just that 
bingham said the fbi told oakland police that daughette fits the 
profile of someone capable of carrying out such an act 
we had no idea what we had on our hands when we picked him 
up said bingham as he started talking we realized we had a 
very scary individual in our presence 
during an interview with police and the fbi bingham said 
daughette appeared very calm relaxed and with very good recall 
while an investigation continued to determine whether the 
alleged assassination plan may result in criminal charges 
daughette remained jailed without bail in san francisco on one 
count of bank robbery 
geoff hansen the federal public defender appointed to represent 
daughette declined comment about his client he said information 
about the daughette case and background will likely be revealed at 
a detention hearing scheduled in us district court on thursday 
after he was arrested friday for allegedly robbing gateway 
savings in oakland daughette readily admitted to the robbery of 
this bank and seven others across the united states said sgt 
sam maddux he also admitted he had been stalking or pursuing the 
president of the united states in an attempt to kill him 
his assassination plan was attributed to voices that were 
telling him to do certain things and if he did not do so he would 
be poisoned maddux said these voices did not tell him why 
bingham said daughette indicated his presidential death plan 
focused on the office not the man he wants to assassinate 
the president 
maddux said daughette also made some mention he had seen the 
tv news reports about the school children shootings in stockton 
and at that point he heard very loud voices that said if he 
couldnt kill the president he should go after school children 
on jan 17 patrick edward purdy opened fire with a 
semiautomatic ak47 on a stockton schoolyard killing five children 
and wounding 29 students and a teacher 
john henneman spokesman for richard roudebush veterans 
administration medical center in indianapolis said daughette was 
admitted on jan 14 1987 for a 30day stay and again in april 
1987 for 45 days daughette was admitted on feb 10 but walked 
away from the hospital on march 20 he said 
henneman said he could not reveal what daughette was treated 
for but said he is an army veteran from flora ind 
bingham said daughette told him he had been treated at va 
hospitals for mental problems and that he had been interviewed by 
secret service authorities for alleged threats against expresident 
reagan state and federal checks failed to show any criminal record 
for daughette he said 
daughette said that on one occasion in michigan he was 
somewhat close to harming bush but because of security 
precautions he was unable to carry out the threat maddux said 
james huse special agent in charge of the secret service office 
in detroit said daughette claimed he had been in hamtramck the 
night before bushs april 17 speech to a crowd of 4000 daughette 
apparently diagramed the area where bush spoke huse said 
he told agents he had picked out the perfect spot to shoot 
from but couldnt reach it on speech day because of metal 
detectors huse said he then ran to several areas trying to 
get close enough for a shot but before he could shoot the 
president finished and left the podium

a detroit firm with which failed civil rights 
chief nominee william lucas is affiliated is defending an apartment 
building against racial discrimination suits the justice 
department said wednesday 
the most recent lawsuit filed wednesday by the departments 
civil rights division charged that river house cooperative inc 
of detroit had engaged in a pattern of intentional racial 
discrimination against blacks 
lucas whom president bush had nominated to be assistant 
attorney general for civil rights has not been involved and will 
not participate in the law firms handling of the case said 
justice department spokesman david runkel 
river house has been represented by evans and luptak a detroit 
firm where lucas is listed as of counsel on a financial 
disclosure form he filed earlier this year 
river house has already been the subject of a discrimination 
suit brought by private plaintiffs said justice department 
spokeswoman deborah burstionwade 
the federal suit charges that the cooperative has engaged in a 
policy and practice of discrimination against blacks in violation 
of the fair housing amendments act of 1988 and the fairhousing 
provisions of the 1968 civil rights act 
in a statement us attorney stephen j markman said its 
long past time that such discrimination in housing is acceptable in 
michigan 
president bushs nomination of lucas 61 a former sheriff and 
chief executive of wayne county mich to head the justice 
departments civil rights division was defeated last week by the 
senate judiciary committee 
opponents charged that lucas lacked professional qualifications 
to head the 150lawyer division of the justice department they 
also questioned his commitment to enforcing civil rights laws 
supporters said lucas who is black was a victim of racism or 
was being penalized for his refusal to criticize recent supreme 
court decisions that they say weaken affirmative action 
the white house says bush is still considering giving lucas a 
socalled recess appointment to the position which would enable 
lucas to serve without senate confirmation through 1990 but such a 
move could anger senators and create political difficulties for 
bush 
runkel meanwhile said the justice department had compiled a 
list of possible alternative candidates for the civil rights post 
lucas will be given a job within the bush administration 
possibly at the justice department runkel said 
he ruled out the possibility that lucas would be appointed to 
head the us marshals service a position lucas had reportedly 
sought before the civil rights nomination

ethiopia asked for help in the 
search for a plane carrying us rep mickey leland and 13 
companions and america responded by sending a fleet of rescue 
aircraft wednesday us officials said 
president bush called the disappearance a matter of great 
concern to us and said ethiopia is going to get all the 
cooperation we can give them in the search now in its third day 
sundown ended another day of the air and ground search with no 
trace of the de havilland twin otter plane but robert houdek us 
charge daffairs in addis ababa said there are a lot of aspects 
that give us cause for hope 
houdek said the plane was a great bush aircraft capable of 
landing in close rough terrain and that the pilot assefa 
gebregiorgis was the best damn bush pilot in ethiopia 
gebregiorgis a former ethiopian air force pilot knows 
ethiopia like the back of his hand houdek said 
leland 44 a texas democrat who heads the house select 
committee on hunger has taken a great interest in africas refugee 
problem and was flying to the fugnido refugee camp near the border 
with sudan 480 miles southwest of the capital of addis ababa 
the congressman from houston arrived on monday and hours later 
boarded the twin otter a highwinged short takeoff and landing 
aircraft powered by two turboprop engines with him were eight 
other americans and five ethiopians including the pilot and 
copilot 
the plane took off in bad weather for the camp gebregiorgis 
made his last radio contact 15 minutes out of addis ababa and the 
plane never arrived 
officials said nine or 10 ethiopian search planes were in the 
air at any one time wednesday crisscrossing an area of about 
24000 square miles police security officials and farmers have 
conducted ground searches 
bush told reporters in the oval office that defense secretary 
richard cheney was trying to find what assets are available for 
the rescue effort 
national security adviser brent scowcroft reported that the 
ethiopians have asked for our help well theyre getting it 
theyre going to get all the cooperation we can give them 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that marxist 
ethiopia agreed to an overflight of the area by a u2 
photoreconnaissance plane a c21 aircraft will be sent to provide 
support for that overflight 
she said an air force c141 starlifter medical evacuation plane 
was sent from west germany on bushs authority carrying a 20member 
medical team and search and rescue weather and communications 
personnel 
defense is sending a number of aircraft two hc130 
aircraft will be deployed from britain later today the 
defense department is considering sending a c5 cargo plane 
carrying five uh60 helicopters 
houdek said one cause for hope was that we havent found any 
wreckage in the rugged mountains and high plateaus along the 
intended flight path 
the search area was expanded wednesday to parts of sudan south 
of the fugnido camp 
theyre putting more resources into the area around mizan 
tefer and guraferda southeast of fugnido said john guerra a 
us embassy political and economics officer 
guraferda is near an area where people reported hearing a light 
plane circling a dirt landing strip monday guerra said and we 
have to reiterate that these areas are so isolated they could have 
put down anyplace 
he described the region as without any communication 
virtually no roads and sparsely populated 
the plane carried an emergency first aid kit he said and we 
just have to keep hoping theyre ok 
guerra conceded that the twin otter could have hit one of the 
many mountains along its path some of which reach heights of more 
than 12000 feet 
also on the plane were three congressional staff members a 
friend four americans including one mans wife from the us 
embassy and the us agency for international development and five 
ethiopians three government officials the pilot and copilot 
fugnido one of four refugee camps in southwestern ethiopia run 
by the un high commissioner for refugees houses more than 
300000 sudanese who have fled famine and civil war

a chemical companys chief executive 
entered a guilty plea for his company wednesday before a federal 
judge who demanded to see the top man before allowing it to 
plead guilty to polluting a waterway 
us district judge jack tanner told edwin e tuttle pennwalt 
corps chief executive and chairman that he wanted to send a 
message that companies and the people who run them must be 
accountable when they damage the environment 
when natural resources are gone they are gone tanner said 
im one of those judges who wants to get someones attention 
from someone who can do something about it thats why youre 
here 
tuttle who calmly and politely answered tanners questions 
apologized for the accident and said his company has spent millions 
of dollars to improve environmental protection and safety at its 
tacoma plant since the january 1985 spill he said he was confident 
the accident would not be repeated 
pennwalt a philadelphiabased chemical company is merging with 
the french petrochemical company elf aquitaine tanner said while 
there was no way the court could monitor pennwalt or elfs future 
performance he believed tuttle was sincere in promising the 
company would do better 
i assure you it will tuttle replied 
environmentalists and legal experts have said that by requiring 
tuttle to appear in person tanner could set a precedent for 
punishing corporate negligence 
david marshall prosecutor in the case said he thought tanners 
actions would serve as a strong deterrent 
im sure mr tuttle is not experienced in standing up before a 
federal judge marshall said for him to have to come here and 
answer the judges questions im sure it got his attention 
pennwalt was charged after a tank spilled at least 75000 
gallons of bleach into tacomas hylebos waterway which empties 
into puget sound the bleach sodium dichromate contained 
hexavalent chromium which can cause cancer when inhaled in a dry 
form 
in court wednesday pennwalt attorney tom kelly said there was 
a negligent failure to test the tank for structural integrity he 
said pennwalt has since moved its caustic chemical tanks away from 
the waterway and surrounded them with a dike 
in may pennwalt agreed to plead guilty to five misdemeanor 
counts after criminal charges against four company officials 
including three executives were dropped tuttle was not charged 
the company also agreed to pay a 500000 fine and to create a 
600000 trust fund to pay for environmental improvements in the 
tacoma area 
the plea agreement covered two counts of negligently failing to 
maintain adequate storage tanks two of discharging pollutants and 
one of failing to promptly report the spill to the coast guard 
twice however tanner refused to accept guilty pleas from 
attorneys and lower ranking executives of pennwalt demanding 
instead that the top man appear before him 
marshall has said the case is among the first in which the 
government based its prosecution on corporate negligence rather 
than deliberate wrongdoing 
it may also be the first instance in which a corporate executive 
has been ordered to plead the guilt of the corporation said david 
skover professor of civil procedure and constitutional law at the 
university of puget sound law school 
after the hearing tuttle declined to speculate on whether 
leaders of other companies might find themselves in a similar 
situation 
the decision to come out here was not dictated by legal 
considerations tuttle said we just thought that this was the 
best way to bring this situation in tacoma to a satisfactory 
conclusion how other companies or other ceos are going to react i 
really have no way of knowing 
tanner repeatedly asked tuttle who would be accountable for the 
spill and for preventing a recurrence 
im here to tell you that as chief executive officer of 
pennwalt that im here to represent pennwalt and say that pennwalt 
is responsible tuttle said

cupcake the pony whose errant hoof 
disrupted service on the long island rail road now has another 
tale of whoa 
lirr officials are demanding a 2625 payment for the buses it 
was forced to hire to get commuters to their destinations when the 
ponys hoof was stuck between train tracks in december setting off 
a twohour delay 
railroad officials said in a letter this week to cupcakes owner 
that if she did not pay the expenses within 30 days they would take 
her to court 
the iron horse can wait until the cows come home said owner 
anne eggers of amagansett shes not paying 
i think this is a very high and mighty way to handle what 
happened said mrs eggers who owns two other ponies this is 
outrageous 
cupcake 19 escaped during the night from the barn in the 
eggers backyard we had just built a new barn and apparently the 
latch was faulty said mrs eggers 
cupcake trotted over to the railroad tracks a few miles away 
where his hoof got stuck the eggers were called early in the 
morning and told their horse was stalling train traffic 
when we got there cupcake looked so sad said mrs eggers 
his head was slumped down and he looked like he had just given up 
any chance of ever being free again 
a veterinarian injected the horse with a sedative rescue 
workers then picked him up by his tail lifting him uninjured from 
the railroad ties 
what happened was not our fault not cupcakes fault said 
mrs eggers there is just no way we are going to pay for this 
we think cupcake is getting a bad rap she said 
lirr spokesman michael charles said he regrets what happened to 
cupcake but the owner should have kept him on her property 
this is a unique case because there is a horse involved 
charles said he said the railroad often seeks payment from people 
who disrupt service such as motorists who damage crossing gates by 
driving through them

the new york convention and visitors bureau 
apologized wednesday to the bronx borough president for posting a 
flyer that promised a tour of fort apache and the burnout 
wilderness in the south bronx 
the flyer had been brought in for display by this private 
sightseeing company and unfortunately was one of those things that 
slipped through said jack macbean spokesman for the visitors 
bureau 
in a letter to marshall murdaugh president of the visitors 
bureau borough president fernando ferrer protested against the 
flyer on behalf of the bronx zoo the botanical garden the 
yankees and the more than 12 million residents of the borough of 
parks and universities 
he also expressed fear that the flyer could deter potential 
investors from continuing their rehabilitation efforts in parts of 
the bronx where housing was abandoned or burned down in the late 
1970s and early 1980s 
arent you aware ferrer wrote that more than 16000 new 
units of housing are being created here most of them in the south 
bronx and that unfortunate characterization of the 41st police 
precinct as fort apache is a wornout cliche that no longer holds 
true 
murdaugh apologized for the flyer and said the visitors bureau 
promotes the bronx in all of our publications in extremely 
positive terms 
the 41st precincts nickname of fort apache was popularized in a 
movie starring paul newman called fort apache the bronx

parliament on wednesday began action to 
investigate purported kickbacks during the socialist administration 
of former premier andreas papandreou in procuring 80 us and 
french jet fighter planes 
it approved formation of a 12member factfinding commission to 
determine whether enough evidence exists to justify a full 
investigation by a parliamentary committee 
the probe involves 40 f16s and 40 frenchmade mirage 2000s and 
300 magic ii missiles conservatives proposed the investigation 
following allegations that greek taxpayers paid many millions of 
dollars more than they should have 
when papandreous panhellenic socialist movement decided to buy 
the french and american built aircraft after first coming to power 
in 1981 negotiations began between the governments 
the f16s were to be bought through us military credits and a 
letter of intent was signed in 1984 greece receives 500 million 
in us military credits a year 
negotiations broke down and the socialist government came into 
direct contact with general dynamics it later signed a contract 
for the f16s following what was billed as a political decision 
by papandreou 
the mirage deal was signed earlier after papandreou announced he 
made the decision following direct negotiations with 
dassaultbreguet of france 
papandreou said direct agreement with the manufacturer 
eliminated middlemen and helped keep the total price lower 
the governmenttomanufacturer negotiations raised questions at 
the time since the aircrafts unit price was reportedly much higher 
than what the same firms quoted to other countries the government 
said the aircraft contained additional sophisticated electronics 
that greatly boosted the unit cost 
conservative new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis said 
tuesday in parliamentary debate that his party considered the 
purchase the biggest scandal in the socialists eightyear 
administration and papandreous biggest political mistake 
the 70yearold papandreou is recuperating from a kidney ailment 
and is also honeymooning with his 35yearold bride he was not 
present in parliament to reply to the charges he has not appeared 
during debates on scandals in which his former government was 
allegedly involved before losing june 18 general elections 
government spokesman athanasios kanelopoulos said last week it 
was unlikely the parliamentary commission would seek information 
from the aircraft manufacturers during the probe 
in march 1985 a spokesman for papandreous government said 2 
billion would be spent on the 80 jets in january 1987 the 
purchase price of the 40 f16s was given by greece as 940 million

a soviet arms control negotiator on wednesday 
called on the united states to agree to monitoring measures for 
underground nuclear weapons testing by the end of the year 
igor palenykh moscows chief envoy to the superpower nuclear 
testing talks said the united states is moving too slowly on 
the issue and urged washington to respond to a soviet proposal 
he called for the talks to be wrapped up this year 
a sixweek round of negotiations that ended tuesday produced 
agreement on some important technical aspects for possible 
inclusion in a testing accord palenykh told a news conference 
the talks are to set verification provisions and secure us 
senate approval for two 1970s unratified superpower nuclear accords 
but negotiations stalled over the monitoring techniques for 
atomic weapons tests palenykh said 
us negotiator c paul robinson has said highlevel 
decisions in the two capitals will be needed during the recess to 
move them along 
no date was set for resuming the testing talks the next phase 
of negotiations will focus on a nuclear test ban 
palenykh said he hoped soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and us scecretary of state james a baker iii would 
discuss the testing accord at their sept 1920 meeting in the 
united states 
the soviet proposal would allow use of both remote seismic or 
onthespot monitoring for any explosion starting from a certain 
threshold he did not specify the threshold palenykh said 
we favor the idea of combining various methods of 
verification of course it will be the right of each side to use 
the methods in its own combination he said 
he said washington wants to use only an onsite method in which 
blasts are measured by a cable placed down a hole near the 
explosion site the united states says its method is the most 
accurate 
the soviets say remote monitoring of the shock waves is precise 
enough simpler and less expensive 
the talks are to establish verification provisions for the 
unratified 1974 threshold test ban treaty for nuclear weapons tests 
and the 1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty on nonmilitary 
blasts 
both limit the power of explosions to 150 kilotons the 
equivalent of 150000 tons of tnt 
the senate rejected the original accords arguing they could not 
be enforced most military analysts agree however that both sides 
have generally abided by the limits

police stood guard wednesday at an apartment 
building where an antidrug crusader was killed and her husband 
spent the day testifying against a man she had accused of selling 
cocaine 
fearful neighbors said they would remain quiet because of 
violent drug dealers 
you open your mouth and try to help out and see what 
happens says one man sitting on a stoop down the street from 
where the hernandez family lives 
maria hernandez a 34yearold mother of three was getting 
ready to go to work about 430 am tuesday when at least five 
shots were fired through the closed bedroom windows of her 
firstfloor apartment in the bushwick section of brooklyn 
one of the bullets hit her in the head and she died a few hours 
later at wyckoff hospital 
her husband carlos hernandez 33 testified wednesday before a 
grand jury against his neighbor raymond gonzalez who allegedly 
stabbed him in the arm and threatened him with an uzi machine gun 
last month after mrs hernandez accused gonzalez of selling cocaine 
in front of their home 
neighbors say the couple often chased drug dealers off their 
property 
the shots were fired through heavy drapes but chief of brooklyn 
detectives francis x smith said he believed the shots were not 
meant as a warning 
if you shoot into a lit residence when people are inside i 
have to assume it was meant to hurt someone he said 
asked tuesday if he planned to stop his antidrug efforts 
hernandez said never 
a patrol car had been driving past the threestory house about 
once an hour since saturday because the family had received death 
threats from drug dealers 
detectives went doortodoor wednesday but a police spokesman 
sgt maurice howard said they havent narrowed it down to any 
specific suspects 
shes trying to protect her neighborhood her kids said 
marguerite wise who lives around the corner and knew the family 
because their children were good friends that woman never hurt 
anybody 
she said she was angered by the drug dealers that plague the 
neighborhood but is afraid to complain to police 
on my block i see what goes on but i shut up she said 
im afraid for my life and my kids 
while women with baby carriages and children congregated in 
front of the hernandezs apartment a block away a halfdozen or 
more drug dealers impassively continued their trade selling heroin 
under brand names like terror and steel ball 
a police cruiser stopped at the intersection and two officers 
bolted out hands on their holsters and headed toward a group of 
men huddled together 
the men ran in all directions and the police nabbed only one 
who had a pocketful of cash but no drugs and so was let go 
less than an hour later the heroin hawkers were back 
its wheeling dealing over here the man sitting on his 
stoop said he declined to give his name saying he was afraid the 
dealers would come after him even though he lives in queens and 
was only visiting relatives 
if i can notice it whats their problem he asked 
referring to the police 
the two officers assigned to guard the home said they realize 
whats going on around them just out of sight but said they dont 
have the answers 
drugs is a way of life around here one said speaking on 
condition that his name not be used this is an every day thing 
the drug problems one thing but the violence has gotten 
worse even toward police officers his partner said

a teenager was reported killed 
by a police plastic bullet during a night of riots in belfast but 
family and friends claimed wednesday there was no rioting in that 
area 
the riots marked the anniversary of a british policy since 
abandoned of detaining terrorism suspects without trial 
british news reports said seamus duffy 15 died after being 
struck by a plastic bullet fired by security forces trying to 
control young supporters of the outlawed irish republican army 
the royal ulster constabulary the provinces police force said 
wednesday plastic bullets had been fired in selfdefense to 
protect property and curb rioters 
duffys family and friends denied there was rioting in the 
dawson street neighborhood where he was hit 
police said crowds in roman catholic areas of west belfast threw 
stones and gasoline bombs lit bonfires and burned british flags 
they reported more than 20 arrests 
while it must be emphasized that the circumstances of seamus 
duffys death have yet to be established the ruc nevertheless 
regrets this loss of young life said police statement issued 
wednesday 
the ruc emphasizes once again they have no desire whatsoever 
to use plastic baton rounds if there is no rioting there will be 
no plastic baton rounds 
damien brown a 15yearold friend of the victim said they were 
walking along a street and saw no rioting i heard a shot looked 
back and seamus was on the ground he said 
brendan duffy the dead boys father accused police of 
opening fire for no reason at all 
northern ireland secretary peter brooke defended use of the 
plastic bullets and said there is no grounds for suggesting 
their use last night was other than in accordance with the law 
brian feeney of the social democratic and labor party the 
largest predominantly roman catholic party in the province said 
plastic bullets were inaccurate lethal weapons 
plastic bullets are not used as a last resort in most cases 
in these circumstances they are used as the first resort feeney 
said on ulster radio 
irelands government expressed deep concern about the boys 
death the british news agency press association quoted an official 
source as saying ireland would request a report on the matter 
government figures show police fired 54234 plastic rounds from 
the time they replaced rubber bullets in 1975 through june 14 
press association said 16 people half of them under age 16 had 
been killed by plastic bullets before duffy died 
sinn fein the iras legal political wing issued a statement 
blaming the death on provocation by security forces 
the street violence marked britains introduction aug 9 1971 
of a policy of interning suspects in northern ireland without 
trial ira supporters the main targets continue to mark the 
anniversary even though the policy was abandoned in 1975 following 
worldwide criticism 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to drive britain from 
northern ireland and unite the protestantdominated province with 
the irish republic which is overwhelmingly catholic

lyon frances secondlargest city 
won the right wednesday to be the host for the 1990 world chess 
championship final 
delegates to the international chess federations annual 
conference were to have voted on bids submitted by lyon and 
wellington the capital of new zealand but john poole president 
of the new zealand chess federation announced he was withdrawing 
the bid 
poole acted after being called to the conference stage for a 
private discussion with the president of the international chess 
federation florencio campomanes of the philippines 
he said campomanes suggested he withdraw new zealands bid he 
was implying very strongly withdrawal with grace or be thrown 
out poole said in an interview 
earlier david anderton of england a member of the federations 
executive council questioned a stipulation by new zealand that its 
bid was conditional on the participation of world champion garri 
kasparov 
the 26yearold soviet has said privately he might not defend 
his title in a match organized solely by the international chess 
federation known by its french acronym fide 
on tuesday conference delegates voted to deny players any say 
in the choice of venue for the chess final and gave fide the power 
to replace a player who refused to accept match conditions 
the rule changes grew out of a power struggle between fide the 
games governing body and the grandmasters association the 
players organization headed by kasparov who is its president 
gillian houser of the wellington organizing committee accused 
fide officials of political manipulation in choosing the venue 
of the chess final a 24game match scheduled for 10 weeks 
starting oct 7 1990 
i am extremely disappointed in the manner the bids were 
handled by fide she said we arrived in puerto rico and the 
rules were changed 
anderton had also complained that the new zealand bid was not 
accompanied by a bankers draft ms houser said however that the 
bid was underwritten by the new zealand government 
boris spassky a former soviet world champion who now plays for 
france and represented the lyon bid said that while he was pleased 
lyon would be the host he did not think any venue should be forced 
on the players 
the chairman of the grandmasters association bessel kok of 
belgium had urged delegates to show more respect for the wishes of 
grandmasters and head off a possible rift 
canadian delegate nathan divinsky said failure to solicit the 
players opinions on match conditions was like organizing a large 
wedding without consulting the bride and groom 
lyon offered 183 million in prize money plus a winners 
trophy encrusted with diamonds and gold and valued at about 93000 
wellington also offered a prize fund of 183 million plus 
about 370000 for the chess federations fund to promote the game 
in developing countries 
a bitter feud flared between campomanes and kasparov in moscow 
in 1985 when campomanes halted kasparovs first title duel with 
anatoly karpov without result but leaving karpov the champion 
although trailing kasparov had just won two games in a row 
while karpov had failed to secure a victory for 21 games 
kasparov repeatedly charged that campomanes intervened to save 
karpov a charge campomanes denies

daughters who have had sexual liaisons before marriage 
it was the second incident this year of an attack on christians 
who engage in liaisons with moslem women the first occured may 1

about 24000 people on wednesday mourned 
the victims of the worlds largest atom bomb used against humans 
and called for japan to strengthen its ban on nuclear warheads 
in nagasakis peace park the crowd commemorated the day 44 
years ago when the united states dropped an atom bomb on this 
western coastal city 
the worlds first atomic attack had been carried out three days 
earlier in hiroshima killing 140000 people the bomb that hit 
nagasaki dubbed fat man was more powerful but because of the 
citys many hills the damage was contained and 70000 died more 
than half the population 
the citys call for steppedup enforcement of a national policy 
banning nuclear warheads including those on us ships at japanese 
ports may command the attention of the government now that the 
governing liberal democrats have been weakened by a series of 
scandals and unpopular policies 
under the 1951 usjapan security treaty the united states 
pledges to notify japan if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the 
country japan says the united states has never consulted with it 
and so it believes such weapons have not entered japan 
critics charge the government uses the agreement to avoid the 
question of whether us ships dock in the country with nuclear 
weapons aboard 
it is a governments duty to its citizens to strive to shed 
light upon the truth not to wait passively for prior 
explanations said mayor hitoshi motoshima an independent 
socialist party chairwoman takako doi said recently that if a 
socialist government were formed after the next election for the 
lower house of parliament it would advocate checking all us 
ships that enter japanese waters for nuclear weapons 
in elections last month the governing liberal democrats lost 
their majority in the upper house 
the disclosure in may that a us hydrogen bomb was lost near an 
island in southernmost japan 24 years ago stirred anger among 
citizens and opposition politicians after investigating the 
government last month said the area had normal radiation levels and 
was safe

president bush expressing concern that he 
might miss some subtlety in signals from irans new leadership 
said wednesday he is determined to pursue every diplomatic avenue 
to free american hostages without trading off or negotiating 
bush in a question and answer session with reporters reminded 
iran of his inauguration day message that goodwill will beget 
goodwill and said he could send no clearer signal of his 
interest to win the release of american hostages and forge a new 
relationship with tehran 
the president said the lives of the hostages are too precious 
for me to be sticking my head in the sand and miss some subtlety in 
this highly complicated corner of the world 
his comments were the latest turn in a series of remarks by bush 
and irans new president hashemi rafsanjani both of whom have 
used public forums in recent days to discuss the international 
diplomatic stirrings aimed at freeing the western hostages held in 
beirut 
on tuesday the tehran times indicated that rafsanjani would 
help obtain freedom for the hostages if the united states released 
billions of dollars in iranian assets impounded a decade ago 
the administration has rejected linking the hostages and the 
assets and bush said my view is to do nothing that will be seen 
as quid pro quo for hostages 
bush said there were mixed signals from iran about its 
intentions as for himself he recalled the rhetorical open hand he 
extended to tehran on the day he took office 
im not talking about terms im talking about talking to get 
people out that are held against their will he said and i 
think i covered that pretty well in my inaugural address when i 
said goodwill will beget goodwill and if ever there was a clearer 
signal in my view thats it 
so i repeat it bush said and if there are changes taking 
place in iran and signals that are shifting i dont want to miss 
a signal 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration was being very careful with our language trying 
to keep the possibility of dialogue open we want to be encouraging 
of improved relations with iran 
meanwhile israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir telephoned bush 
shamirs adviser avi pazner said the prime minister repeated 
israels position that it will free shiite moslem cleric sheik 
abdul karim obeid only in exchange for three israeli soldiers held 
in lebanon and all the hostages 
sixteen western hostages are held in lebanon including eight 
americans 
the call was originiated by shamir according to a senior 
israeli official speaking on condition that he not be identified 
he said shamir felt bush would appreciate the personal contact 
in washington the president and other administration leaders 
denied that the united states was shifting its policy about the way 
it deals with terrorists and kidnappers 
bushs administration and ronald reagans before him had 
flatly ruled out any negotiations but bush seemed to hint at some 
change in an interview tuesday with the boston globe 
he told the newspaper we do not negotiate in any way thats 
going to jeopardize the lives of other americans a statement 
that seemed to suggest that some form of negotiations would be 
acceptable 
fitzwater said there was no change in policy he said the 
administration had come up with the new phrasing for the policy 
to give definition to it because everybody else has tried to do 
it for us 
bush in his meeting with reporters in the oval office said 
i dont think theres any subtle change from the position of 
the reagan administration 
im not going to do anything that would put some other 
american perhaps in some other place at some other time at 
risk and that means trading off or negotiating for hostages the 
president said 
bush added i hope im openminded enough to talk and to 
exercise every diplomatic channel i can to free these americans 
no american is going to be content until these people are free 
and i would not be doing my job if i didnt approach it in that 
manner 
the president said the united states would continue to press a 
diplomatic effort on the hostages behalf reaching out to as many 
countries as possible 
bush said some countries previously on the sidelines of the 
hostage crisis now are giving assistance to the united states 
because they are infuriated or angered or repulsed by a 
videotape purporting to show the hanging of marine lt col william 
r higgins and another videotape showing american hostage joseph 
cicippio urging the release of a moslem cleric who was kidnapped by 
israel 
theyve been so offended by that regardless of their view on 
the politics of the middle east or any other area that we are 
finding more and more of a willingness to help bush said 
in his interview with the globe bush noted that fitzwater had 
described him as cautiously optimistic about the hostages but the 
president went on to add in the interview i have no reason to 
say that i can see in a short run a total resolution of the 
holding of americanhostage problem 
he said wednesday im conducting the foreign policy of this 
country in a prudent manner that i hope will get these people out 
of there but the last thing i want to do is elevate the hopes of 
these families who have been disappointed over and over again to 
have those hopes dashed 
bush invited the press to the oval office as he posed for 
pictures with cardinal bernard law the roman catholic leader from 
boston bush urged americans to say a prayer this weekend for the 
hostages and their families

the government announced wednesday it 
would sell 14 staterun companies to the private sector among 
emergency measures to cut the public deficit and curb 1000 percent 
annual inflation 
the measures included selling off government shipping operations 
and official residences in brasilia the capital according ronaldo 
costa couto president jose sarneys chief of staff 
costa couto refused comment on whether thousands of civil 
servants would be fired as sarney promised in january he said the 
government would maintain strategic state companies but he would 
not elaborate

brazils ailing economy including boosting imports to increase 
industrial competition and slashing state subsidies and tax breaks 
to the private sector

privileges enjoyed by high officials including nonessential trips 
and statefunded publicity campaigns

largest and negative economic growth brazil sorely needs new 
money to meet an interest payment of 3 billion due in september to 
private foreign banks 
the government is negotiating an economic agreement with the 
international monetary fund that would qualify the country for 
nearly 4 billion in fresh loans withheld by private banks and 
lending organizations 
creditors have refused to lend more money to brazil which has 
been unable to control inflation monetary expansion or a 
ballooning public deficit which is around 7 percent of the 300

two usair mechanics have been suspended 
without pay for 90 days following a company investigation into the 
emergency landing of an airliner in north carolina last week a 
company spokesman said wednesday 
the action extends a temporary suspension imposed last week 
after federal investigators found wheel chocks were unintentionally 
left in both wheel wells before the plane took off from washington 
national airport 
usair spokesman david shipley declined to release the names of 
the mechanics or details of the companys investigation 
usair group headquartered outside washington merged its 
piedmont subsidiary into usair on saturday three days after the 
piedmont boeing 737 with 100 people aboard on a flight from 
washington bound for columbia sc landed at greensboro nc with 
only the nose and right landing gear in place 
there were no injuries and only the left engine was damaged 
a ntsb spokesman said friday the initial investigation showed 
the two mechanics were responsible for the final check before the 
plane was turned over to the flight crew 
investigators found a 2 foot rubber wheel chock used to keep 
planes from rolling on the ground jammed into the left wheel well 
and they believe one in the right wheel well was shaken out 
the plane was moved six times the night before the flight ntsb 
has said 
the investigators said ground crews sometimes stuff the chocks 
in the wheel wells when moving planes

democratic party chairman ronald h brown 
attacked corruption at housing and urban development during 
republican administrations wednesday and republican chairman lee 
atwater charged statehouse and congressional districts were 
rigged for democrats 
the two men rallied their party members at separate sessions at 
the national conference of state legislatures 
brown said republicans had been elected on a mandate to 
eliminate waste fraud and abuse in government but had instead 
raised misdeeds to a new art form 
the more we turn over the hud record the more slime oozes 
into the light brown told a gathering of about 200 democratic 
lawmakers 
atwater speaking to about 300 republican legislators in an 
adjoining banquet hall asked them to lead an assault on a 
democratfavoring system of statehouse and congressional districts 
during redistricting in 1991 
right now most legislative and congressional districts are 
rigged in favor of democrats atwater said republican 
candidates received nearly half the congressional vote in 1988 but 
only make up 40 percent of the seats in congress 
we believe that the voters have a fundamental right to choose 
their representatives freely and fairly to the state 
legislature and to congress they shouldnt have to go through 
votelaundering democrats in some smokefilled room to make their 
opinions known 
brown said republicans had used hud as a dumping ground for 
unemployed republican political hacks he cited as hud abuses the 
building of a housing project in beverly hills calif a country 
club in southern california and a swimming pool on new yorks long 
island 
and just down the road in stilwell oklahoma they built 
sewage treatment facilities to serve a single poultry processing 
plant which has yet to be opened he said 
he said republicans under the reagan administration gave the 
pentagon a blank check and looked the other way while contractors 
bribed pentagon employees and gouged the government 
brown accused president george bush of paying lip service to 
important issues such as the environment and the war on drugs 
brown also addressed redistricting saying said there is no 
bigger priority for democrats and that it is vital that democrats 
maintain their majority status 
what i mean is that the pen that draws those lines is in the 
hands of good democrats he said we need to target our 
resources to make sure that we hold that pen 
the republicans have threatened to litigate us to death on 
redistricting plans and we expect them to do it 
atwater said politics of the next decade will be shaped by what 
happens during redistricting 
the political landscape of the nation over the next 10 years 
is going to be determined by whether we have a fair redistricting 
in 1991 he said 
when democrats look to the future this rigged system of 
representation is about all they have left atwater said were 
the party of the future the democrats are the party of the 
political machine 
he said republicans are within six seats of winning a majority 
in 20 state legislative chambers and fair redistricting is within 
our grasp

us forces blockaded fort amador for 
more than three hours wednesday after two american soldiers were 
arrested then withdrew after the troopers were exchanged for two 
arrested panamanians 
us army helicopters circled overhead during the confrontation 
and panamanian troops could be seen aiming antiaircraft weapons at 
them 
fort amador is a shared area that includes barracks for 
panamanian troops a building where gen manuel antonio noriega has 
an office offices of the us southern command offices a us 
naval station and a golf course used by us personnel 
sources said noriega commander of the panamanian defense forces 
and the countrys de facto ruler was not at the fort amador office 
wednesday 
col ronald sconyers spokesman for the southern command said 
the incident began when a us military policeman was arrested near 
el chorillo where the panamanian defense forces general staff has 
its headquarters 
the soldier was taken to nearby fort amador where another us 
military policeman was arrested when he tried to obtain his 
comrades release sconyers said 
us troops then arrested two panamanian military policemen at 
the gates to the fort and us troops and armored personnel 
carriers blockaded the entrance until the men were released 
arresting the americans may have been retaliation for the brief 
detention by us authorities on tuesday of 29 panamanians 
including noriegas brotherinlaw and eight other soldiers 
panamanian military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed sconyers account but gave no reason for the initial 
arrest 
the southern command and the defense forces later accused each 
other of violating agreements relating to movements of their 
respective troops in the area 
they are trying to humilitate us in our own house said maj 
edgardo lopez grimaldo a spokesman for the defense forces we 
will not be trapped into provocation in order not to respond to 
yankee arrogance 
at the pentagon in washington army maj kathy wood said the 
actions did not violate the panama canal treaties under which 
the commander of a military area of coordination has 
responsibility for the security of his area 
civilians including reporters were allowed across the line 
during the blockade at amador but not panamanian soldiers 
reporters watched about three hours later as us and panamanian 
officers met and exchanged the soldiers the five armored personnel 
carriers withdrew and the entrance was reopened 
the blockade delayed a panamanian antiterrorist unit that 
planned to hold an exercise at the national bank of panama a 
15story building in panama city because the unit could not take 
trucks and other equipment out of fort amador 
a few dozen soldiers from the two countries lined a street that 
divides nearby quarry heights where southern command headquarters 
is located from panama city 
southern command said 29 panamanians were detained 75 minutes 
tuesday because they entered a jointuse military area without 
authorization among them were four military officers including 
maj manuel sieiro noriegas brotherinlaw 
weapons taken from them included four automatic rifles a 
machine gun two grenades and seven pistols the southern command 
said 
the un security council has scheduled debate for friday on 
panamas complaint that the united states is trying to undermine it 
gen noriega was indicted in florida last year on us charges 
of drug trafficking and money laundering he denied the charges and 
fought off us efforts to force him to quit including economic 
sanctions against panama

spring the greatest danger is complacency

agreed on a plan to demobilize the contras within four months 
israel galeano the rebel chief of staff known as comandante 
franklin was among the officers filing claims at the miami office 
of the us immigration and naturalization service 
the officers denied there was a connection between their 
applications and the accord signed monday by five central american 
presidents in tela honduras calling for the dismantling of 
nicaraguas antisandinista forces 
were doing this errand to facilitate our struggle said 
francisco johnny delgadillo a political adviser on the 
southern front who also was granted asylum 
galeano said the contra leaders have no plans to move to the 
united states telling the miami herald that the officers sought 
nothing more than travel documents 
some of us have the need right now to mobilize in the 
international field galeano said there is a need to get 
documents to travel 
delgadillo admitted the action could be misinterpreted by the 
estimated 12000 rebel troops languishing in border camps 
it could be demoralizing to the troops if we were seen as 
retiring from the struggle delgadillo said but the troops 
know thats not so our struggle continues 
he voiced bitterness at the honduras agreement we dont want 
to live like slaves to the signature of the presidents he said 
we want to go on being rebels 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega declared that the plan spells 
the death of the rebel movement the sandinista government agreed 
to democratic reforms leading up to national elections in return 
for the repatriation or resettlement of the contras by dec 8 
the bush administration which lobbied to keep the contras 
intact as a fighting force until nicaraguas february 1990 
elections has reluctantly embraced the five presidents accord 
congress cut off military aid to the rebels in february 1988 
galeano vowed wednesday to continue his fight with limitless 
human resources and return to the jungled mountains of nicaragua 
if the contras are kicked out of honduras 
each government has acted on nothing more than its own selfish 
interest he said were the ones who are paying the price 
perry rivkind the ins district director in miami said the 
claims were given special action status and reviewed 
immediately 
because of the nature of their positions and possible security 
problems we ask that their cases be moved fast rivkind said 
a complete list of the nine commanders was not available 
wednesday but the names that were known included luis angel 
lopez known as leonel jose emmanuel aguilar a southern front 
commander and fremio jimmy leo altamirano a northern front 
commander

gen colin l powell who is expected to be named 
the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is described by 
colleagues as a soldiers soldier who doesnt particularly like 
staff jobs 
the fourstar army general who became national security adviser 
in 1987 and heads the us forces command at fort mcpherson in 
atlanta would become the first black to serve as the nations 
senior military officer 
the 52yearold son of jamaican immigrants powell was highly 
regarded by president reagan succeeding frank c carlucci as 
reagans national security adviser 
he was the general who guided preparations for the gorbachev 
summits who helped restructure and give new direction to the 
national security council following the irancontra investigation 
and who by his personal integrity and commitment has restored 
confidence in the national security council itself said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
those qualities were cited by the washington post in calling 
powell the antidote to ollie north the former nsc aide 
convicted in the irancontra scandal 
colin gets mad at me when i say this but i think he should go 
to the very top of the military establishment up to and including 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff carlucci has said 
a senior administration official said in washington on wednesday 
that president bush is expected to name powell to the position 
powell took over us forces command or forscom in april 
putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the 
us army in interviews since then he has emphasized hes proud 
of the accomplishments of the average us soldier over the years 
in the old days powell said soldiers would keep a pinball 
machine in a corner of their barracks today theres a computer 
there 
on personal level however powell doesnt always keep up with 
the times youd only know the 1972 chrysler station wagon parked 
in the generals space each day was his by reading the fourstar 
decal on its front 
washington colleagues have described powell as a soldiers 
soldier who doesnt like staff jobs carlucci says that powell 
has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that reagan got 
powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the 
general had turned carlucci down several times 
in his time off he tells young blacks to spend their lives 
helping to open doors for minorities 
dont squander the blood sweat and tears of those who paved 
the way for you he told clark atlanta university graduates this 
spring the greatest danger is complacency 
he tells of his battles with racial discrimination recalling 
the time an alabama state trooper pulled him over for speeding in 
the early 1960s the trooper looked at the car complete with new 
york plates and an lbj bumper sticker and hissed boy get out 
of here 
on the job powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining 
resources for his troops a task he said was top priority when he 
became forscom commander 
as leader of powell is responsible for the training and 
preparedness of more than 1 million active reserve and national 
guard troops in the united states 
powells daily interests are more pressing keeping his troops 
ready for combat with the hope they will never be needed 
and in that position he keeps a close eye on the soviet union 
the soviets are going through wrenching historic change 
beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system 
is broken and has to be changed he said at his forscom 
installation but their forscom is strong we must be strong 
born in new york powell completed training in the airborne and 
ranger schools and served in germany and vietnam 
commissioned in the infantry in 1958 he was wounded twice 
during two tours in vietnam once falling into a trap lined with 
sharpened bamboo sticks and impaling a foot 
his decorations include the distinguished service medal the 
legion of merit the bronze star and the purple heart 
powell and his wife alma have two daughters and a son

explorers crossing antarctica with dog sleds 
spent the past two days trying to salvage two of their three sleds 
which were damaged when they crashed in a descent on ice a 
spokeswoman said wednesday night 
the international team led by minnesotan will steger tore down 
both damaged sleds and reconstructed them into one fullsized sled 
and a halfsized sled said expedition spokeswoman cathy demoll 
we were careening down some steep blue ice the two komatek 
homestead sleds crashed together and rolled splitting the runners 
lengthwise steger said in a fax received wednesday at the 
expeditions headquarters in st paul 
it was a big mistake he said we should have been using 
ropes 
blue ice is hard smooth ice that has been blown clear of snow 
demoll said the accident occurred in an area with very low 
visibility and the second sled couldnt slow down on the incline 
none of the six team members was injured nor were any of the 
dogs 
the team had been crossing its first piece of land the jason 
peninsula rather than the flatter smoother ice shelf and have 
encountered what steger called a minefield of crevasses many of 
them deep very deep 
the 36 dogs which normally run 12 to a sled will likely be 
resdistributed along with the teams load as the group continues 
its 4000mile journey demoll said 
stegers group ruled out the expense of sending in a spare sled 
by plane and instead hopes to make it until the scheduled resupply 
mission on aug 25 
steger and fellow international transantarctica expedition 
members from france great britain the soviet union japan and 
china since last month have been making a firstever attempt to 
cross antarctica from west to east the sevenmonth journey is 
designed in part to draw world attention to antarcticas fragile 
environmental and political climate

delegates to a summit meeting on trade among 
pacific rim countries said they were offended by a bush 
administration officials joke about soviet women and his attack on 
marxism 
it was only a joke but i dont like the joke said lu 
zuwen commercial consul for the chinese consulate in san 
francisco hes a joker i dont know what his purpose was 
fred m zeder ii head of the governments overseas private 
investment corp began his address tuesday with a joke in which 
chinas late chairman mao zedong is asked by a foreign journalist 
what might have happened if lee harvey oswald had assassinated 
khrushchev rather than president kennedy 
mimicking a stereotypical chinese accent zeder said mao 
replied only one thing certain aristotle onassis would not have 
married mrs khrushchev 
delegates said few listeners were amused 
nor was the soviet delegate to the weeklong summit happy to 
hear zeder turn to his opinion of marxist philosophy at a gathering 
designed to improve trade relations between 23 pacific rim nations 
zeder accused the soviets of marching into poland hungary and 
yugoslavia of bringing castros cuban mercenaries into 
nicaragua angola and ethiopia and of spreading marxism every 
place in the world 
zeders speech received scattered applause but soviet delegate 
vyacheslav zilanov drew louder applause later when he criticized 
zeders remarks 
i dont agree with some of the opinions put forward by zeder 
in his morning speech zilanov said i dont feel this pacific 
summit is the right place to discuss marxistleninist theory and 
its position right now 
in a telephone interview wednesday from his home in washington 
dc zeder said he didnt mean to offend anyone i was talking 
to the wrong audience i apologize to any technocrats who might 
have been offended by anything 
the joke he said is an old old joke told to him by bob 
hope its not racist not vulgar not provocative its just 
funny i told that same joke to the ambassador from beijing he 
thought it was very funny said zeder 
i think they might have been offended by the fact that i tried 
to explain that the marxistleninist process didnt work he 
said gorbachev himself has admitted that the system is flawed 
that was my message that the system has failed 
zeder 68 was appointed this year to head opic by president 
bush 
john anderson director of the washington state department of 
trade and economic development and chairman of the summit 
organizing committee said officials had reviewed zeders initial 
speech and toned it down 
anderson did not give details of the earlier draft but said 
we were looking at something that could have blown the conference 
up

the federal government has dropped a lawsuit 
accusing northrop of falsifying tests on mx missile guidance 
devices and has agreed not to refile it the aerospace company said 
wednesday 
federal prosecutors could not immediately be reached to explain 
why they dropped the 3 million suit it had alleged fraud and 
violations of the false claims act saying tests on about 20 heat 
exchangers for the mx were never properly conducted 
a lawyer for northrop whistleblowers characterized the suit 
as just a tiny piece of a mosaic of multimilliondollar civil and 
criminal cases filed by former and present northrop employees and 
the government 
unfortunately for northrop our cases are alive and well and 
moving through both the civil and criminal courts attorney 
herbert hafif said 
the company has denied the accusations of overcharges and 
falsifying tests which involve the cruise missile and stealth 
bomber as well as the mx missile 
northrop spokesman tony cantafio said the heat exchanger suit 
filed in federal court here in august 1987 was dismissed with 
prejudice by us district judge david kenyon last week meaning 
it cannot be refiled 
the governments action in dismissing the case with prejudice 
clearly establishes that none of these violations occurred a 
company statement said 
heat exchangers remove heat generated by a guidance system 
component known as the inertial measurement unit a 
basketballsized device that guides nuclear missiles to their 
targets 
the case arose when a heat exchanger component and a test stand 
exploded during testing in january 1986 as part of the dismissal 
of the case northrop agreed to pay the government 45045 for the 
damage to government equipment 
cantafio declined to describe what led up to the dismissal of 
the suit which the company announced late in the day the us 
attorneys office in los angeles referred calls to the justice 
departments special civil litigation section in washington which 
had closed for the day 
hafif the lead attorney for several northrop employees who have 
sued northop under the false claims act characterized the case as 
relatively insignificant 
northrop is a hell of a lot better at issuing press releases 
than it is at building missiles hafif said that press release 
is designed to deceive the public and congress into believing that 
a small government case somehow affects our major cases and 
charges 
the false claims act allows workers or executives who sue their 
employers for fraud against the government to recover as much as 30 
percent of any damages awarded 
the federal government has the option of joining such suits but 
so far has not done so in an mx missile case hafif filed on behalf 
of several plaintiffs led by david peterson a former northrop 
employee 
the case accuses northrop of overcharging falsifying tests and 
using faulty parts on the guidance system for the mx missile and 
hafif said damages could run more than 100 million 
the government has joined another of hafifs civil suits a 30 
million case involving allegations of faked tests on the guidance 
system for the cruise missile 
a federal grand jury has issued a related criminal indictment 
accusing northrop and five employees of fraud and conspiracy for 
allegedly falsifying tests on nucleararmed cruise missiles and for 
supplying equipment that the government knew failed to meet 
specifications 
another hafif lawsuit involves allegations that northrop cost 
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in overcharges and false 
tests on the stealth bomber the government has so far declined to 
join that case

backers of a plan to authorize casino 
gambling in ohio conceded defeat wednesday after failing in a 
lastminute push wednesday to place a proposal on the nov 7 
ballot officials said 
the casino advocates notified the state shortly before 10 pm 
that they had given up the effort to get enough petition signatures 
by a midnight deadline said steven fought a spokesman for the 
secretary of states office 
auto dealer alan spitzer spokesman for the group and a 
potential casino owner seemed to concede defeat at a news 
conference wednesday afternoon and made plans for a similar effort 
for the 1990 ballot 
the proposal got new life however when the secretary of 
states office agreed to accept the signatures until midnight 
fought said 
the group needed 306661 signatures or 10 percent of the number 
of people who voted in the 1986 governors election to put the 
proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot 
spitzer said the luv ohio committee luv stands for let us vote 
collected between 250000 and 275000 signatures 
spitzers committee began petitions in june after the state 
senate despite passage by the house rejected a bill authorizing a 
casino in lorain 
the ballot proposal would go further it would permit casinos in 
seven socalled casino districts generally surrounding and 
including ohios largest cities subject to approval of voters in 
local elections 
spitzer whose family owns car dealerships throughout central 
and northern ohio says the plan would help create jobs and boost 
the economy

complex and casino in an abandoned shipyard in lorain saying it 
would breathe new life into the northern ohio steel citys economy

petition drive and a lack of people needed to circulate petitions

the soviets were listening and 
journalists had reported for weeks on columbias payload so why 
did military and nasa officials go to the trouble of keeping the 
launch time and other details secret 
by being inexact about the launch time it complicates their 
ability to track lt col ron rand air force spokesman said of 
the soviets they may or may not listen in but were going to do 
everything we can to keep the payload anonymous 
but scientists who attended tuesdays launch of the defense 
departments fourth shuttle mission said the military shroud wont 
stop the soviets from finding out all about the reconnaissance 
satellite columbia and its five astronauts are believed to be 
launching 
theres no reason i can think of for the secrecy said john 
pike a space analyst with the federation of american scientists 
in principle they could run this countdown like they run every 
countdown maybe this way its more fun for them

drug abuse is not merely a black problem 
but a national dilemma that will require major resources to solve 
say leaders attending the national urban league convention 
we cant talk about the future we want to see for urban 
america without talking about the no 1 threat in our inner cities 
today illegal drugs president bush told the league tuesday as 
the drug issue received heavy attention from the largely black 
organization 
urban league president john e jacob in an interview tuesday 
said we believe the federal government ought to mobilize 
this nation to a realization that this is not a black problem but a 
national problem that will require national resources 
but jacob and others attending the meeting called for efforts to 
protect the innocent during crackdowns in housing projects

the stock markets recent climb toward record 
highs is worrying some investors who wonder whether the elevation 
in stock prices will be followed by a plunge like the october 1987 
crash 
nearly a third of the paper value of stocks was wiped out in the 
crash and the weeks preceeding it with the market on a path 
remarkably similar to the one it followed the months before the 
crash comparisons to 1987 are being drawn 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 418 to finish at 
269917 tuesday approaching the record 272242 close of aug 25 
1987 
the current rallys apologists point to dissimilarities in 
market conditions between then and now that they contend should 
lead to a much happier outcome this time

dave purchase spends most afternoons 
trading gossip with a slow parade of drug addicts on a gritty 
downtown sidewalk 
but purchase a cheerful engaging man has something else to 
swap with the drug users he calls just folks and counts among 
his friends 
how ya doin pumpkin he asks a woman with haunted eyes as 
he hands her a clean hypodermic needle for the used one she drops 
into a little red box sitting on a folding table not too bad 
she says with a tired smile 
thats great purchase booms thats great 
a woman with a headful of tiny black braids brings purchase a 
pair of needles she had used to feed a heroin habit she lingers in 
the feeble sunshine with fellow junkies to watch the action down 
the street a squad car screeches to a stop and a policeman alights 
to drag a fallendown drunk to the curb 
i shoot heroin im a dope fiend the woman with braids 
tells a visitor but i come down here most every day for clean 
needles i like the high man but i dont want to die for it i 
dont want no aids 
the 31yearold woman who gave her name only as stephanie 
talks of enrolling in a treatment program to kick her 10year 
habit she points at purchase the rig man there he cares what 
happens to us 
in this neighborhood of halfabandoned buildings sagging 
fences and weedchoked lots purchase and his crew of county 
health workers have built what is hailed as the nations first 
successful program to reduce the number of dirty needles among drug 
addicts in an attempt to slow the spread of aids 
the program which swaps 1500 clean needles for dirty ones a 
week is being studied or at least partly duplicated in places like 
honululu boulder colo and san francisco observers are 
impressed by an unexpected bonus new access to elusive innercity 
addicts and a chance to help break their habits 
critics include bush administration officials who say backers of 
such programs have yet to show they slow the spread of aids state 
lawmakers and some treatment experts say tacomas program not only 
violates the states drug paraphernelia law but that it tacitly 
sanctions illegal drug use 
to put up a little table to exchange needles like mr purchase 
does is like alcoholics anonymous putting up a bar on the sidewalk 
and giving out free drinks while passing out pamphlets against 
drunk driving said the rev joe ellis whose tacoma rescue 
mission is just up the street from where purchase hands out needles 
every afternoon but sunday 
purchase has little patience for critics like ellis you know 
what these people are really saying they are saying let em 
die either that or they havent seen the evidence that 
needlesharing is spreading aids 
purchase 49 a former drug counselor won local government 
funding and staff in january after launching the program with his 
own money a year ago as a personal war on the spread of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
the 45000 programs purpose is simple he said if you want 
to slow the spread of aids you have to slow the spread through 
dirty needles homosexual contact has been surpassed by shared 
needles as a cause of aids spread 
intravenous drug users account for 27 percent of all aids cases 
nationally as of midjuly 99936 americans had contracted the 
disease and 58014 of those had died in washington 1383 had been 
diagnosed and 753 of them have died 
purchases war on dirty needles has drawn applause in the sad 
underground of street addicts and among many health officials but 
he is quick to note hed be out of business if authorities decided 
to enforce a misdemeanor state law against delivering or possessing 
syringes without a prescription 
tacoma officials have permitted the program to continue because 
these people are not trying to commit criminal acts but rather 
are waging a war on aids said tom felnagle chief criminal deputy 
prosecutor for pierce county 
purchase a drug counselor for 20 years says he owes addicts a 
great deal which is why he contracted with a medical supply house 
a year ago to distribute needles himself no questions asked 
i worked in the business since 1969 these people paid my 
mortgage put food on my table i mean ive been living off their 
misery for 20 years like any decent social worker i decided to do 
something for them 
county health director dr al allen is excited at the new 
bridge to this industrial port citys most elusive underclass 
longtime iv drug users you do have to go to people you might not 
feel comfortable with on their terms and be willing to wash their 
feet so to speak if you want to reach them 
working out of a van purchase and his crew also hand out 
condoms little bottles of bleach to clean needles and blueberry 
muffins an outreach health worker is always with them ready to 
offer counseling and other help 
county officials say they have found a substantial decrease 
in needle sharing as a result of the program and have referred more 
than 150 addicts for treatment after purchase and his crew 
cultivated a relationship with them 
opponents like ellis and state lawmaker charles wolfe a spokane 
physician who failed this year to win legislation against needle 
exchange note that backers have not demonstrated the program slows 
the spread of aids 
worse ellis asserts the program is unnecessary because aids 
among local iv drug users is no where near as bad as in new york 
city and elsewhere they are using east coast statistics to 
justify the idea here he said 
he bristled at the suggestion that he would just as soon let 
aids victims die we spend over 2 million a year on drug and 
alcohol programs does that sound like somebody who wants to let 
them die 
another heath department spokesman terry reid said its unfair 
to expect the program to demonstrate in less than several years 
that it slows the spread of aids how can you demonstrate success 
a year after the program starts when the incubation period for the 
disease is about seven years 
purchase puts it another way if were wrong then we wasted a 
few cents a needle if were right we saved a lot of lives 
as a steady stream of addicts stopped at purchases table 
stephanie leaned against a wall and explained addicts willingness 
to use the program 
we dont have to give our name we dont have to do nothin 
but bring the rig man a dirty needle for a clean one and the cops 
dont bother us its easy and i think its workin hey dope 
fiends arent sharin their needles like they used to cause they 
can get clean ones without a lot of problems

although most were reared in roman catholicism 
hispanics in growing numbers are switching to evangelical churches 
pleasing those congregations but worrying catholic leaders 
both seek to meet special needs of spanishdescended americans 
swelled by a modern tide of immigration they now number nearly 
20 million in this country most of them catholics but studies 
indicate a heavy defection rate to protestant churches of 
evangelical style 
the movement of us hispanics to evangelical protestantism is 
a historic event of great significance says the rev allan 
figueroa deck a catholic specialist on hispanic ministry 
protestantism is achieving a foothold in the hispanic world a 
massive presence that it has never enjoyed before 
evidence of such evangelical inroads into catholicism has turned 
up in many latin american countries as well as in the united states 
deck of the jesuit school of theology at berkeley calif says 
the success of the evangelicals is directly related to the heat 
the passion with which its adherents communicate their message 
hispanics generally like that he writes in the national 
catholic weekly america but its not the style of the typical 
orderly reasoned us catholic service generally shunning 
emotionalism 
surveys by the chicagobased national opinion research center 
indicate a steady increase during the last decade in the proportion 
of us hispanics who are protestants now amounting to 23 percent 
that is up from 16 percent in the l970s in those years 77 
percent listed themselves as catholic and 7 percent other or no 
religion but the l98286 figures indicate only 71 percent remain 
catholic 
the rev andrew greeley catholic sociologist novelist and a 
senior associate at the research center calculates hispanic shifts 
from catholicism to protestantism at 60000 a year nearly a 
million over the last 15 years 
the protestant segment of americans of hispanic origin is not 
only large it is growing rapidly he writes in america 
he notes that the defection rate is lower among 
mexicanamericans 15 percent than among puerto ricans 24 
percent and others 26 percent and lower in the west than in the 
east 
storefront evangelical churches attracting hispanics have 
proliferated in major cities in the east and also on the west coast 
more than threefourths of the spanishorigin protestants are 
either baptists or fundamentalists greeley says 
hispanics have joined fervent protestant groups in which their 
religion provides them with intense activity and community 
support he says adding that catholicism apparently fails to 
meet those emotional communal needs 
the same point is emphasized by deck president of the academy 
of catholic hispanic theologians in the united states 
he says the fundamental problem for catholicism is the 
inflexibility of the parish whose operations are often out 
of gear with the dispositions and needs of hispanics 
the sense of being at home achieving an environment that is 
welcoming and familiar is extremely hard to attain in the large 
urban ethnically mixed parish he says 
us catholicism is very uncomfortable with the cultural core 
of hispanic catholicsm popular religiosity it views all of that 
as at best quaint and at worst superstitious 
enthusiastic religion and affective approaches are downplayed 
our liturgies are orderly and even elegant our preaching 
calmly reasoned and conversational rhetoric and even eloquence are 
shunned 
he says the evangelical protestant appeal to hispanics stresses 
factors of personalism and community small hospitable 
congregations and ministers from the hispanic community 
to accomplish those characteristics he suggests reviving the 
socalled national or ethnic parishes popular in past periods of 
other catholic immigrants now integrated into society their 
special parishes outmoded 
however he says a new wave of immigrants indicates reviving 
such special arrangements to meet the need of hispanics for a 
sense of acceptance their own turf and ministers adapted to 
their language and customs 
such adaptations are applied in evangelical denominations such 
as southern baptists it has 2300 hispanic pastors and a total of 
2612 hispanic congregations up 40 percent in this decade 
catholicism although more than three times bigger has fewer 
hispanic priests estimated under 2000 
united methodists are working to extend a national plan for 
hispanic ministry developed in 1986 
catholic bishops at their june meeting in south orange nj 
took steps for implementing a plan for special efforts among 
hispanics to cope with evangelical proselytism 
a catholic bishop criticized some of that proselytism as 
deceptive this was disputed by a southern baptist leader who said 
hispanics simply were being offered the ggospel message of hope

standing beside mother gooses house talking 
to little bo peep seems an odd way to learn about showtimes new 
nightmare classics 
the apparent contradiction illustrates how busy shelley duvall 
is these days 
during an interview shes dressed as bo peep for her production 
of mother goose rock n rhyme for the disney channel shes 
also executive producer of the new horror series for the showtime 
pay television network 
nightmare classics premieres saturday with turn of the 
screw henry james victorian suspense tale starring amy irving 
david hemmings and paul balthazar getty 
were doing the classic stories of psychological horror rather 
than the contemporary gore said duvall were selecting the 
tales from henry james edgar allan poe robert louis stevenson we 
have a low budget so part of the selection process is finding 
stories from the approximate same period so we could use the same 
sets theres more than one way to skin a cat 
one show the eyes of the panther based on two stories by 
ambrose bierce required log cabins that they havent figured out 
yet how to reuse 
other episodes are dr jekyll and mr hyde and carmilla 
duvall was on the set of her musical fantasy about the abduction 
of mother goose the house had a huge goose head on the roof and 
next to it was the house belonging to the old woman who lived in a 
shoe overhead huge tufts of cotton clouds were suspended from the 
blue cloth sky 
as bo peep she was dressed in a long red wig a broadbrimmed 
hat a frilly tutu redandwhite stripped stockings and platform 
wedgies her dog gizmo a mixture of pomeranian and cairn terrier 
with a recent short haircut was at her feet 
the fairy tale musical also stars garry shandling and teri garr 
as jack and jill howie mandell as humpty dumpty cyndi lauper and 
woody harrelson as mary and her lamb harry anderson as peter 
piper little richard as ole king cole art garfunkel as the 
bartender at georgie porgies lounge and deborah harry as the old 
woman who lived in a shoe jean stapleton as mother goose and dan 
gilroy as her son gordon goose 
dans never had any experience but hes a natural actor 
she said everybody wanted me to find someone more experienced 
but i stuck to my guns the only mistake i made was when i didnt 
go with my instincts bob altman found me in houston and i had no 
experience he took a chance on me 
in all duvall has starred in seven robert altman movies 
including a role as olive oyl in popeye shes produced two 
other series for showtime her first was faerie tale theatre 
and the second was shelley duvalls tall tales and legends her 
longtime collaborator is bridget terry whos producing dinner at 
eight starring lauren bacall marsha mason and charles durning 
for turner network television 
actually the distance between fairy tales and horror stories is 
quite short 
fairy tales can be very scary said duvall the grimm 
tales particularly can be grim many of them were thinly disguised 
political commentary when i selected the stories for faerie tale 
theatre i had to be very careful 
duvall produced 26 episodes of faerie tale theatre which 
are now in syndication and are available on video cassette she 
feels there is a much wider audience for the stories since only 
about six million people saw them on showtime 
she has also stopped production of tall tales which is 
going into syndication and videos 
when i pitched nightmare classics i had the choice of doing 
that or continuing with tall tales she said i chose to 
start the new series i had a body of work with tall tales that i 
could take and sell elsewhere 
duvall said she enjoys running her own production company and 
wants to produce all forms of entertainment shes much too busy 
now getting her company started but said shed like to try her 
hand at directing too

from the outset president bush said his 
administration would work patiently persistently but probably 
not very dramatically in the long agonizing effort to gain 
freedom for americans held hostage in lebanon 
that applies even in time of crisis it fits the restrained 
lowkey approach the president and his lieutenants are taking in 
the current situation even toward the apparent killing of a 
kidnapped american marine 
there is no lack of anger outrage and frustration at the white 
house but venting it with threats of retribution would do nothing 
to help the eight americans still held captive of shiite moslem 
kidnappers 
indeed the dilemma confronting bush as it confronted his 
predecessors is that reaction even retaliation serves the 
purposes of the terrorists who set out to create crisis in the 
first place 
the options are few anyhow when he was vice president bush 
headed an administration task force on terrorism which observed in 
its report that american principles do not permit random 
retaliation 
bush said he was outraged beyond words when the captors of lt 
col william r higgins claimed to have hanged him on july 31 in 
revenge for the kidnapping of sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite 
cleric by israeli commandos 
the presidents voice broke with emotion as he praised higgins 
on monday calling him one who stands as a symbol of the courage 
that burns in the breast of every american in uniform 
hours later the fbi said its experts had concluded that the man 
shown hanging in a videotape issued by the kidnappers probably was 
higgins but did not say how or when he died higgins was taken 
hostage feb 17 1988 while serving with a united nations 
peacekeeping unit 
bush talked with higgins wife he made no public statement on 
the fbi report 
the administration says it is actively pursuing diplomatic 
efforts to gain release of the remaining american hostages at the 
same time it has reinforced the us fleet in the eastern 
mediterranean on aug 1 with joseph ciccipio under death threat 
word was relayed to tehran that if any more hostages were killed 
the united states would hold iran responsible 
but the white house has been purposefully vague about what 
action might follow saying only that there has been planning for 
every option so too on speculation about possible ways out 
there are a lot of ideas being floated a lot of exchanges 
being made but its primarily a matter of talking and listening 
and not signaling your moves said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater we will be careful not to respond to every new 
development new statement new idea he said there are going 
to be a lot of them 
fitzwater also said the administration does not expect a quick 
resolution of the hostage situation which already is measured in 
years 
militant moslem groups now hold at least 16 foreign hostages 
the american held longest is terry anderson now 41 chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press seized in beirut on 
march 16 1985 
before he was inaugurated bush said he would explore every path 
that might point to freedom for the hostages he said he could 
foresee a day of better us relations with iran and that it could 
be hastened by iranian steps to ease the hostage situation but he 
said he did not expect a swift dramatic breakthrough 
now his administration is trying to transform a crisis into a 
solution 
offering advice is easier 
the senate adopted one resolution saying bush should determine 
whether the united states can retaliate against the killers of 
higgins in a manner that would reduce the risk to americans from 
terrorism then it adopted another asking the cia and the 
pentagon for a report by sept 1 on how best to locate and rescue 
the remaining american hostages 
neither is realistic but then neither is binding

as they join the growing numbers of the 
working retired in this country many people find themselves 
facing an unhappy tradeoff 
its common these days to regard retirement as a chance to start 
a second career to keep working part time as a consultant or to 
see if a longtime hobby can be turned into a legitimate livelihood 
but the more money you can earn from such an endeavor the more 
likely you are to forfeit some or all of your annual social 
security benefits 
under the rules prevailing this year retirees aged 62 to 64 
lose 1 in social security benefits for every 2 they earn above 
6480 in any given year 
in the 65 to 69 age group the cutoff point is 8880 next 
year its slated to rise to 9360 beyond which 1 in benefits 
will be negated for every 3 earned 
the restrictions dont apply to anyone aged 70 or older 
if youre drawing social security and working at a salaried job 
there isnt much you can do about this situation other than lobby 
for and hope for passage of legislative proposals to make the 
limits more generous 
but if you can set yourself up as an independent consultant 
working for yourself and selling your services to others you may 
have more flexibility says william brennan editor of the monthly 
financial planning reporter published by the accounting firm of 
ernst amp young 
in such circumstances brennan says you might consider 
postponing receipt of income from your work to future years in 
order to minimize the bite of the social security limits 
with the notable exception of fees collected by people serving 
on boards of directors selfemployment earnings are only counted 
when received not when earned he points out 
thus for example a 64yearold retiree doing freelance 
carpentry work this fall might choose to delay sending out some 
bills until yearend so that payment doesnt count toward 1989 
earnings 
at age 69 the incentive to defer compensation would be 
especially strong since earnings are subject to no limit in the 
following year 
to do this sort of thing of course you need to be able to 
establish that you are truly selfemployed brennan cautions 
providing consulting exclusively to your former employer probably 
wont work he says 
beyond having more than one customer he observes the real 
test is the extent of your independence to make your own decisions 
and set your own schedule 
there also could be some pitfalls awaiting people who are 
legally eligible to defer compensation brennan adds the strategy 
could go awry if income tax rates are increased in future years 
if payment is put off for a significant time inflation may 
erode its value and it may not be available for you to invest it 
for interest dividends or capital gains 
theres also the question of how confident you are about the 
customers ability and willingness to pay up when you eventually 
want to collect 
as popular as deferral strategies may be brennan concludes it 
is prudent to make sure beforehand that their disadvantages wont 
outweigh their benefits

consumers have to be given some credit for the 
manner in which they have behaved in recent months counting their 
money and retreating from high prices and borrowing costs 
they beat the carmakers at their own game declining to pay full 
price and forcing them to offer rebates and discounts in order to 
cut inventories they have been slow to buy bigticket appliances 
they are cautious 
they have slowed their acquisition of credit in part because 
bank card borrowing comes at exorbitant rates these days and 
lenders refuse to come down in line with other rates 
consumer credit in june did rise but the tendency to go into 
debt has receded over the past year in may the annual growth rate 
was 73 percent but in june it dropped to 51 percent 
the tendency of consumers to watch their dollars does seem 
contradicted by one area of credit bank card credit has continued 
to rise however the disinclination of banks to lower their rates 
215 percent annual interest isnt uncommon that consumer 
resistance so clear in other ways seems almost certain 
buyers also slowed the rate of increase in home prices by 
declining to chase the market theyve actually forced prices down 
in some areas a rarity buyers now have the uupper hand in most of 
the country 
they are showing their good sense in other ways too borrowing 
costs on homes are falling and many homeowners are planning to 
refinance at lower rates again its a consumers market banks 
are advertising for customers 
meanwhile consumers have been strengthening their cash 
position they have improved their savings personal savings as a 
percentage of income in june rose to 59 percent from 54 percent 
in may and the total of 2241 billion was the second highest ever 
personal income has been improving too the improvement hasnt 
been sharp but it has been healthy especially since inflation has 
been relatively restrained both low inflation and rising income 
reinforce higher savings 
these and other factors including an unusually strong 
employment situation put the consumer in a strong position as the 
economy slows in a sense consumers are in a position to dictate 
in many areas of the economy 
the situation is in stark contrast to conditions that prevailed 
in the 1970s when the consumer was on the run 
so desperate where buyers in that decade that they purchased in 
anticipation of price increases and in so doing drove prices even 
higher they were panicked convinced that they could save by 
buying in advance of need 
the situation today is reversed buyers are more inclined to sit 
and wait convinced that waiting is the way to a better deal they 
are patient rather than frantic they are making the seller come to 
them 
it is a rather rare situation but it is one that might help to 
correct a slur on consumers that they are mere puppets 
manipulated by clever marketers if they can hold their ground they 
might change some minds

everybody has wraparound teeth and everyone sings and dances so 
spontaneously 
hollywood musicals provided davies a native of liverpool 
england with the perfect escape from his own unhappy life the 
youngest of 10 children his father was a violent man who 
terrorized the family he died when terence was 7 over the years 
his older siblings filled in details of their fathers behavior 
davies never forgot 
when i was growing i would get up and look at the house and 
go into the street and say i must remember how it looks today i 
dont know why but ive got a very accurate visual and aural 
memory i can remember conversations verbatim he said 
distant voices still lives his new film represents just a 
fraction of those memories davies recreates his childhood by 
showing the pain of a working class family in liverpool in the 
1940s and 50s their hardship increased by a violent father 
but like singing in the rain or meet me in st louis 
another favorite of davies the characters of distant lives are 
sustained by music at any time someone is likely to break into 
song maybe byebye blackbird or roll out the barrel 
pastoral symphony and hymn to the virgin are heard in 
the film too 
the family would go to this pub and a few friends would be 
over and everyone would have a singsong davies said theyd 
go back to the house and have another singsong everyone did it 
i remember my sister was going to buy 10 cents a dance from 
love me or leave me starring doris day and james cagney i was 
agog for weeks on end we were going to have doris day singing in 
our house 
davies new film shows how popular entertainment mixes with real 
life and how the lines get blurred he recalled the bright smiles 
and lilting melodies of hollywood musicals enhancing the dim 
environment of his own city 
when you came out of the cinema into the slums you didnt 
think oh how were terribly deprived it transformed the way you 
looked at your life you thought isnt it fabulous wasnt doris 
day fabulous in that number you were on a high for three or four 
weeks 
my sisters went all the time i was absolutely thrilled with 
meet me in st louis they lived on kensington avenue and we 
lived on kensington street i was sure we were exactly alike i was 
just sorry we didnt have leon ames as a father 
he first wanted to act appearing in amateur productions of 
uncle vanya the cherry orchard and many other plays in 
1972 he went to coventry drama and stumbled upon a chance to 
direct 
i had written a screenplay children which was the first 
part of the autobiographical trilogy that i made over a period of 
10 years no one would do it 
but there was a series on televison called cinema now and 
it told how i could apply to the british film institute for money 
i sent a script in and a year later was asked to go to london where 
i was told to direct 
life and fantasy again blurred davies a complete novice at 
directing was terrified on the set and remembered bitterly the 
crews disrespectful treatment still he fell in love with 
filmmaking 
i realized when i looked down the camera the first time that 
this is what i wanted to do even if i do it badly youve captured 
a moment and there was magic between the filming of it and it 
actually taking place its still terribly exciting 
by 1983 with the completion of madonna and child and 
death and transfiguration the second and third parts of his 
trilogy davies had learned his craft 
each shot for distant voices was planned before the start of 
filming and he quickly cast pete postlethwaite and freda dowie as 
his parents davies only concern was how his siblings would react 
to seeing their lives on screen 
their feelings were mixed he said its opening up a lot 
of suffering but theyre also very proud im a film director and i 
go to america and have lunch at malibu calif i thought it was a 
homage to them i didnt feel it was dirty laundry they suffered 
so much i thought it had to be told 
still davies is disappointed that directing has taken the magic 
out of his own moviegoing experience reality has finally intruded 
on fantasy 
as soon as you create something youve lost your innocence i 
miss going to the cinema and being absolutely transported by it 
now im too critical

a public opinion poll has thrust the issue of 
quebec independence back into the canadian political arena 
although quebeckers rejected separatism in a referendum nearly a 
decade ago 
the gallup poll indicated that 28 percent of canadians believe 
frenchspeaking quebec should become an independent country 
according to gallup it was the strongest support for separatism 
nationally since the companys pollsters first asked the question 
more than 20 years ago 
perhaps the most startling finding of the poll of 1034 
canadians was that 27 percent of englishspeaking canadians and 36 
percent of frenchspeaking canadians favored quebecs becoming a 
separate nation 
there long has been resentment in parts of englishspeaking 
canada especially in the west of what is perceived as favoritism 
or special treatment for quebec but the percentage of those who 
would just as soon see it separate from canada had not been 
perceived to be as high as the poll indicated 
prime minister brian mulroney a native of quebec brushed the 
poll findings aside 
the heartbeat of the nation is strong its vigorous and its 
resolved to even greater unity he said 
its kind of silly to ask canadians whether they want to 
divide their country or to strip their country the answer when 
you strip away the varnish is absolutely no 
mulroney conceded that some linguistic tensions exist in canada 
but said that always has been the case 
indeed a focus in the canadian news media on the national unity 
issue may be as much a result of a languid summer without much else 
attracting attention as to any concrete developments in quebec 
premier robert bourassa of quebec who opposes separatism 
appears virtually certain to win the election expected in early 
fall possibly with an even greater margin of victory for his 
provincial liberal party than in 1985 when it won 99 of 122 seats 
in the quebec legislature 
the parti quebecois which found success with its separatist 
message in the 1970s has fallen on hard times and the economic 
prosperity that has lasted in quebec along with most of canada for 
seven years makes this an unlikely time for a comeback 
quebec canadas largest and second most populous province with 
65 million people is 81 percent frenchspeaking 
no one is predicting a new surge of the separatist movement the 
poll results were a reminder of how intractable the frenchenglish 
issues are in canada and the difficulties of running a country in 
which nine provinces are majority englishspeaking and one 
frenchspeaking 
among those expessing unease however was john turner the 
retiring leader of the naional liberal party which sits in 
opposition to mulroneys progressive conservatives 
i have during the course of the last six or nine months 
experienced and felt a deterioration in the mood of the country 
turner said i believe all those who share with me the view of a 
tolerant bilingual federation working in equilibrium should be 
concerned 
quebec barely surfaced as an issue in the national election this 
past november when the big issue was the free trade agreement with 
the united states 
mulroneys victory allowed the pact to take effect as scheduled 
jan 1 and quebec was a center of support for the agreement and 
its native son mulroneys progressive conservatives do not run in 
quebecs provincial elections 
but the quebec governments refusal last winter to remove its 
restrictions on bilingual signs despite a supreme court of canada 
decision touched off resentment among the provinces english 
minority and in englishspeaking provinces 
french is required throughout quebec as the only language on 
most outdoor signs 
there also has been growing realization that the meech lake 
accord a constitutional agreement recognizing quebec as a 
distinct society may not make its deadline on june 23 for 
ratification by all 10 provinces 
the atlantic coast province of new brunswick and manitoba in the 
west have yet to ratify the agreement and threats have been made 
to reconsider ratification elsewhere before the deadline 
the meech lake accord developed because quebec had refused to 
join the nine other provinces in signing the national constitution 
at the outset of the decade the constitution still applies to 
quebec even without its signature but the impasse makes it more 
difficult for changes to be made on such national issues as native 
rights and the way the senate operates 
quebec voters rejected sovereignty in a 1980 referendum after a 
dizzying decade in which power shifted from the english minority to 
the french majority 
the parti quebecois governed the province from 1976 to 1985 but 
lost its spirit after 60 percent of quebecs voters in the 1980 
referendum rejected separation

a sense of hopelessness has driven a record number 
of east germans across newly porous borders to the west this year 
private and government agencies who help resettle refugees say 
they expect about 100000 east germans to make it to west germany 
by the end of the year 
the number of despairing east germans climbing crawling and 
catapulting their way across the border has swelled to a rate 
unparalleled since the flood of escapees 30 years ago that exodus 
was dammed by the construction of the berlin wall on aug 13 1961 
and those braving the heavily fortified borders are now joined 
by a new breed of escapees who obtain legal permission to travel 
abroad then refuse to return 
it is a sense that grows stronger each day among east germans 
that they have no hope no perspectives for better days as long as 
the current regime is in power said rainer hildebrandt director 
of the august 13th society that aids east german refugees 
the fact that 50 percent of those escaping now are under the 
age of 24 is testimony to the general despair felt there 
about 10000 east germans with legal tourist visas have sought 
asylum in west berlin so far this year and at least 70000 legal 
emigres are expected by the end of the year 
a west german official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
at least 200 east germans are seeking asylum at west german 
embassies in hungary czechoslovakia and east berlin 
we advise against this method as there are continuing dangers 
involved and there is simply no way to accommodate people at the 
representations the official said 
in budapest hungary where an estimated 130 east germans are 
seeking refugee status and access to west germany authorities have 
hinted that they may recognize a right to asylum but no decisions 
have been made 
west germanys deputy minister for intergerman relations 
walter priesnitz said recently that east germans should not try to 
leave without proper documents through hungary which also has a 
communist government 
in the course of democratic reform hungary has dismantled 
nearly half of the 160mile barbedwire border separating it from 
the west 
officials in austria have been approached for help by 237 east 
germans who fled across the border since the hungarians began 
dismantling the barbed wire in may but they estimate up to six 
times that number have gone directly to the west german embassy in 
vienna after arriving via hungary 
judith toth the hungarian interior ministry official 
responsible for refugee affairs has said a special refugee camp 
will be erected in budapest for those seeking asylum but until 
then those seeking refuge at the west german embassy now may be 
forced to return to east germany 
detlef kuehn president of the institute for intergerman 
affairs in west germany told the associated press that the west 
german government advises east germans to seek legal means of 
emigrating but he acknowledged that the majority of applicants 
must wait years 
it is hopelessness that is driving so many here kuehn said 
there are no limits on the number of east germans that we will 
take in but we have no interest in depopulating east germany 
one east berliner who did not want his name used said east 
germans are turning to hungary as an escape route because the 
prospects for reform in their own nation seem ever dimmer as erich 
honecker remains the communist party leader 
erich honecker is apparently a very healthy man and as long 
as he is alive we will have the status quo he said 
but right now we have a terrible situation because nobody 
knows what the reality is it is naivete and wishful thinking that 
makes people seek help in another socialist country 
east german officials declined the discuss the isssue 
these matters remain very sensitive as you know said 
herman thost a foreign ministry official in east berlin who deals 
with press relations 
honecker has told visiting west german officials his government 
has repealed longstanding orders to shoot those trying to escape 
except in cases where other lives are threatened no shootings have 
been reported since february despite a rising rate of escapes 
the august 13th society calculates that at least 189 east 
germans were killed in failed escape attempts since the berlin wall 
was built 
at least 350 escapes have been recorded this year up to midjuly 
over the wall and across the heavily fortified borders with the 
rest of west germany

once hailed as the showpiece of 
president corazon aquinos government the land reform program is 
so bogged down in corruption and red tape and crippled by loopholes 
that even the official responsible for it wants to change it 
mrs aquino signed the comprehensive agrarian reform law in 
june 1988 to redistribute land to nearly 4 million peasants and 
free rural filipinos from what she called their ancient poverty 
land reform was widely hailed as essential to defeat the 
20yearold communist insurgency in the countryside and break the 
grip on power enjoyed by powerful landlords 
last year the government distributed 150000 land titles 
covering some 254000 acres most of the titles were awarded to 
rice and corn farmers making the effort merely an extension of the 
land reform program decreed by ousted president ferdinand e marcos 
marcos program covered only corn and riceproducing lands but 
the aquino plan encompasses all crop holdings 
critics claim the new law is so flawed that it stands little 
chance of achieving its goals and of being more successful than the 
dozen previous attempts at land reform since the 1930s 
under the program expected to cost 10 billion the government 
will pay landlords for their land those who then take possession 
must repay the government over 30 years at 6 percent annual 
interest 
militant farmer groups claim few can afford to repay and have 
proposed that peasants pay half a sack of rice per hectare 247 
acres a year for three decades 
most critics also cite loopholes favoring landlords landowners 
can retain five hectares 123 acres plus three hectares 74 
acres for each direct heir over age 15 
the department of agrarian reform acknowledges that it is 
uncertain how much of the 24 million acres of agricultural land has 
effectively been removed from the program by exemptions 
under the program estates of more than 50 hectares 1235 
acres are to remain untouched until 1992 the program also gives 
landowners the option of establishing profitsharing plans for 
workers in lieu of transferring titles 
among those who opted for this alternative was mrs aquinos 
family the cojuangcos who established a stock plan for workers on 
their 12350acre sugarcane estate in central luzon 
a review committee suspended the implementation of the profit 
sharing scheme after critics claimed mrs aquinos family grossly 
undervalued their property 
if land reform means to set the peasant free from the 
political and economic domination of the landlord which is the 
essence of a genuine agricultural reform program then on the 
whole it failed to break land monopoly said jaime tadeo leader 
of the leftist philippines peasant movement what it gave were 
just crumbs a few leftovers 
in an attempt to get more large estates for redistribution 
before 1992 the government offered landlords the option of selling 
their property now 
but in several cases the government paid far more for the land 
than it was found to be worth triggering allegations of corruption 
the most controversial case involved the proposed purchase of 
4666 acres in camarines sur province for the peso equivalent of 
29 million the sale was blocked when investigators found the 
land was worth only about 143000 
those scandals have given more ammunition to those attacking 
the program said rep edsel lagman chairman of the house of 
representatives agrarian reform committee those supporting it 
are now wavering and the skeptical are slowly joining those who 
have been opposing it 
the scandal led to the resignation of philip juico as the 
agrarian reform secretary and suspension of a voluntary sales 
program pending a review of the more than 700 sale offers 
juico was replaced by immigration chairman miriam defensor 
santiago who recently told a house of representatives committee 
that the current law is a hodgepodge full of inconsistencies 
and should be amended 
she said the provisions for establishing just compensation 
for landowners was too complicated and that the reform aspects of 
the program had been watereddown by landlord blocs in congress 
mrs santiago also said the government lacks the money to 
purchase lands under the current system 
the government had hoped to finance the program in part through 
the sale of assets recovered from marcos and his associates but so 
far that effort has generated only 340 million about 140 
million in foreign aid is also available for land reform 
problems in the land reform program have given the rebel new 
peoples army a propaganda coup it has announced its own land 
reform program in which it distributes to supporters property 
seized from landlords 
the government estimates indicate the rebels have seized more 
than 76500 acres nationwide but rebel spokesmen claim to have 
handed out 111000 acres in the central visayas islands alone

as head of the first soviet office promulgating 
the tenets of alcoholics anonymous helen kuzmicheva says the 
approach makes for reconstruction of the soul 
it offers not just recovery from alcoholism but a program of 
spiritual recovery she says it brings out a completely new 
personality 
ms kuzmicheva an attractive blonde russian of 38 and 
coordinator of the newly opened sovietamerican alcoholism center 
in moscow says the aa technique is being found as effective 
there as in america 
after all we are human beings all of us she said in an 
interview due to the changes being made in our country we also 
have been able to acquire the movement 
among participants she said believers speak of god helping 
them overcome their addiction others speak of a higher power 
they all recognize they need a higher power exerted to help them 
as to what kind they need time to understand it is god 
such religious terminology may seem unusual for a 
healthpromoting agency in an officially atheist society but 
millions of people there are devout believers 
however aa itself steers clear of overtly religious 
affirmations or criteria acknowledging only that help of a 
higher power is essential in overcoming alcoholism but leaving 
that aspect undefined 
individuals may interpret that power as the group and its 
mutually supportive associations or may consider it the 
judeochristian god who acts in human affairs or both whichever 
involves a spiritual dimension 
it is purposely kept vague so as to take in all comers 
god as you understand him ms kuzmicheva puts it using a 
typical aa phrase meaning that the power is whatever recovering 
alcoholics consider it 
they had lost control over themselves and lost the very 
quality of being human when they drank she said when they see 
life with sober eyes miracles happen in their lives they grow 
spiritually 
they regain their best spiritual selves 
ms kuzmicheva a professional educator who served as a factory 
personnel director before taking the post at the new moscow center 
recently completed a monthlong us tour with three soviet aa 
members 
accompanying them was the rev jw canty a new york episcopal 
priest who had established the new soviet center and who in 1987 
had started the soviets first aa group called moscow beginners 
he says soviet authorities initially were dubious of the 
project but their attitude has changed to cautious respect now 
that they are seeing alcoholics get a second chance at life 
on the 16city tour concluded in late june the group had 
addressed school and church gatherings met with numerous aa 
groups usually in churches but also with an atheistagnostic aa 
group in new york 
they also toured various health facilities and met with former 
presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter and their wives attending 
a sunday school class taught by carter in his hometown of plains 
ga 
ms kuzmicheva said the scripture lesson as carter interpreted 
it emphasized that when god gives his promises they sooner or 
later are fulfilled 
this is very promising for our country she said adding 
that recent liberalizing developments there pointed toward a more 
fulfilling future 
however like america the soviet has immense problems with 
alcoholism soviet leader gorbachev in 1985 launched a campaign 
against it but popular resistance forced him to ease some of the 
restrictions 
unfortunately the problem is very acute in our country ms 
kuzmicheva said estimating there are 10 to 15 million alcoholics 
in a population of 290 million 
we have seen how strong and spiritual the aa movement is in 
this country and we hope to have the same success in our country 
she said it will work it will work all over the world 
on the us tour the soviet aa members often gave their 
testimony in us meetings using only first names as customary in 
aa two of them were atheists one of them a believer 
they told of families breaking up being repeatedly 
hospitalized but not being able to quit drinking until admitting 
they couldnt without help of a higher power saha 43 an engineer 
and a nonbeliever puts it this way 
with alcoholism you have to admit despair before you 
experience victory 
ms kuzmicheva not an alcoholic herself says she is a 
believer but not a regular churchgoer many did not believe in 
god when they drank but when they become sober they begin to 
believe

a funny thing happened to the ford ranger on its way to becoming 
americas compact pickup truck leader it went from being a work 
truck to being a personal vehicle 
the change was more than just semantics it went below the sheet 
metal 
ford increased the rangers horsepower jazzed up the outside 
with twotone paint and made the interior more carlike as the 
ranger evolved over the decade and its sales rose to more than 
300000 a year 
todays 1989 ford ranger reaps the benefits of all the changes 
with the automaker projecting at the close of the 1989 model year 
that the ranger will retain its title as the topselling compact 
pickup 
the test vehicle was a 1989 ranger xlt twowheeldrive the most 
popular ranger model because it offers a number of optional 
features in one lowpriced package 
the xlt had such amenities as power steering deluxe twotone 
paint a rear window that slides open and amfm stereo cassette 
player with clock price out the door was 10464 
the test truck felt sturdy like a truck and easily 
maneuverable like a car 
its high profile offered a good view of traffic ahead and its 
cloth bench seats with center armrest and easytoread instrument 
panel made for a comfortable interior 
i did feel the jostling shuddering of a trucklike suspension 
over big bumps but it wasnt overly bothersome there also was 
trucklike road noise 
the allterrain tires and rear antilock brakes gave surefooted 
confidence the fivespeed manual transmission was a bit notchy in 
its feel but it and the newfor89 fourcylinder engine with eight 
spark plugs performed admirably 
ford boosted the horsepower 10 percent this model year to 100 
with the 23iter twin plug engine design that uses two spark 
plugs per cylinder 
it helped give the ranger a more peppy ride and more power for 
trailer towing fuel economy was commendable with the epa rating 
at 23 mpg in the city and 27 mpg on the highway 
i wouldnt advise trying to seat three across in the ranger xlt 
regular cab the middle person would either have the gear shifter 
between the legs or would have to sit sideways with the legs 
dangling over to the other passengers area 
this year ford added a columnmounted automatic transmission 
shift lever to help solve this problem if you get the manual 
transmission and carry only two people in the regular cab as i did 
the legroom seems decent and seating is adequate 
ford also offers a super cab that has the largest rear seating 
package in the compact pickup truck segment 
length of the test ranger pickup box was 763 inches bringing 
total vehicle length to 1756 inches while thats considerably 
shorter than the more than 194 inches of overall length of the ford 
f150 fullsize pickups its still sufficient room for hauling 
wood furniture and the lawn mower if the occasion arises 
men between 30 and 35 years of age are 85 percent of the ranger 
buyers and they use the little pickup mostly for personal use such 
as driving to work according to beryl stajich ford division 
compact truck marketing plans manager sixtyfive percent are 
married but most do not have children 
many ranger buyers are firsttime truck buyers he said adding 
that twothirds either trade in cars as they buy the ranger or had 
a car as an alternative purchase he called them middle of the 
roaders who are educated with somewhat upscale contemporary 
lifestyles but are more entrylevel in their purchases 
theyre looking for a good deal a low purchase price 
stajich said and they can customize the ranger it has 
high flexibility 
he noted that when the ranger first came out in 1981 ford saw 
the truck as something that would offer value to more traditional 
truck buyers older married men who would want to get better fuel 
economy from their trucks 
that was true for the first year stajich said then 
toyota led the way adding youthful appeal to their trucks in 
1987 we revamped our marketing and made the ranger sportier 
base price of 9001 for the test ranger is not the lowest among 
compact pickup trucks a similar chevrolet s10 for example starts 
below 9000 
but stajich said many of the features offered in the xlt package 
are separate options on other small pickups such as those offered 
by toyota and nissan and thus could add up to a more expensive 
final price 
consumer reports magazine rates the ford ranger twowheeldrive 
with fourylinder engine as average in its reports of trouble from 
owners of 198387 models

each day sidney jones wages a frustrating and 
sometimes futile battle to save the innocent victims of drug abuse 
and poor prenatal care 
when you lose a child theres a feeling of defeat says 
jones who as head of obstetrics at dc general hospital is 
confronted by washingtons infant mortality rate the worst in the 
nation youve had every hope of saving this person and you 
suddenly feel hopeless 
in the hospitals neonatal intensive care unit eight babies lie 
fighting for their lives one is just 15 days old 
he tests positive for the aids virus and has syphilis his body 
is not producing red blood cells properly causing his stomach to 
bloat 
white swatches of cloth are bound around his tiny ankles 
holding down his legs to keep him from hurting himself he suffers 
from what doctors here call tremblisness adult drug addicts 
call it the shakes at just two weeks of age this unnamed baby is 
going through withrawal 
his mother is a cocaine addict her name and whereabouts are 
unknown hospital officials do not expect her to return to claim 
the child 
to varying degrees this picture is repeated at urban hospitals 
across the country hampering efforts to reduce a national infant 
mortality rate that already lags behind japan and most of europe 
each year about 40000 american babies die before their first 
birthday for a national rate last year of 99 deaths per 1000 
births 
washingtons rate of 232 per 1000 births was more than double 
the already distressing national figure substantially above the 
world average for developed nations of about 17 and far worse than 
rates for western europe and japan 
in britain for example the rate is 91 per 1000 births in 
west germany 83 in france 76 in sweden 57 and in japan 
49 
washingtons large black population is afflicted in particular 
with high infant mortality the national center for health 
statistics says black infants nationwide are nearly four times more 
likely to die as a result of prematurity and low birthweight 
many of these babies suffer from seizures due to brain damage 
cerebral hemmorhage increased heart rate and stunted organ growth 
most of the 244 infants who died in the district of columbia 
last year were born to drugaddicted mothers many of whom sought 
no prenatal health care at all says reed tuckson the citys 
health commissioner under such circumstances officials say there 
is frequently little that doctors such as jordan can do 
the reality is as tragic as we predicted tuckson says 
prenatal care in washington costs an estimated 400 per mother 
but the lifetime costs of caring for low birthweight infants can 
easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars tuckson says 
if you went to chicago or to boston you would see the same 
phenomenon says gordon avery chairman of the neonatology 
department at dc general other cities say between 10 and 15 
percent of babies there are born to drug addicted mothers 
avery says one pregnant woman he encountered went into labor 
prematurely while snorting or smoking cocaine which can cause the 
uterus to contract and cut off oxygen to the baby 
of the children who do survive many are abandoned hospital 
officials have termed them boarder babies 
dc general had 11 boarder babies last month they remain at 
the hospital an average of 124 days before they are adopted or 
placed in foster care 
the cost to the hospital for boarder babies last year was 
500662 officials say 
a commission of the us department of health and human services 
commission thinks a national plan to combat infant mortality may be 
one answer to the problem 
thirty years ago we as a nation made a commitment to to care 
for the elderly said rae grad director of the national 
commission to prevent infant mortality the elderly can get 
medicare and social security we are saying that we as a nation 
have not made a commitment to children

when cable tv pioneer and movie buff ted turner 
bought the mgm movie library three years ago he got the wizard 
of oz but he cant show it on his own stations until 1999 
under an agreement hammered out at the time of the mgm purchase 
the turner broadcast system gave up television rights to the 
wizard of oz but obtained the rights to another classic gone 
with the wind turners favorite film 
scarlett ohara and rhett butler thus left cbs for tbs while 
dorothy and toto set up camp with cbs which first showed the 
wizard of oz to television viewers on the night of nov 3 1956 
what happened was ted traded said karen nicol of tbs we 
had the tv rights to the wizard of oz but ted really wanted 
gone with the wind 
even though turner cant show oz on its tbs superstation or on 
tnt turner network television its feature entertainment channel 
that hasnt stopped turner and his companies from marking the 
films 50th anniversary 
under license from tbs mgmua home video will release its 
golden 50th anniversary collectors edition videocassette of 
oz complete with a commemorative videotape package 
fancy packaging aside the new version is being touted as a 
videophiles delight fully restored and with two added 
sequences a dance reprise of if i only had a brain performed 
by ray bolger as the scarecrow and another musical number the 
jitterbug both were cut from the film during editing 
missing from the home video version are the familiar 
blackandwhite kansas sequences before dorothy crashes into oz 
thats because they arent really supposed to be black and white 
the films first moments were originally filmed in sepia and white 
for a softer transition to the technicolor splendor of oz later 
prints opted for the simpler blackandwhite technique 
its a beautifully restored print with the original 
technicolor at its best said tbs frank miller and with the 
kansas sequences in the original sepia tone its really 
beautiful 
its not as if the old videocassette did badly released in 
1980 its sold 600000 copies in the united states according to 
tbs 
in addition to the new videocassette tbs also is releasing the 
restored film for special screenings in theaters across the 
country miller said 
a new release of the score is coming out on compact disc 
including a recording buddy ebsen made during his nine days as the 
tin woodman according to oz film chronicler aljean harmetz 
ebsen suffered a debilitating allergic reaction to the aluminum 
dust the costumers dumped all over him and was hospitalized 
leading to his replacement with jack haley 
and if seeing the movie and hearing the score arent enough 
oz fans under a worldwide licensing program of turner home 
entertainment can buy an oztentatious array of stuff 
theres oz clothing for the whole family including maternity 
wear ties jewelry costumes of the scarecrow the cowardly lion 
and other characters greeting cards postcards buttons key 
chains calendars bendable toys giftwrap lunch boxes beach 
towels 
all are for sale in the turner store a souvenir stand in 
the lobby of turners cnn center building in atlanta 
also available dental reminder cards to send cowardly 
patients off to see the dentist which for some can be as big an 
adventure as going off to see the wizard

actor richard comar says the set built for 
bordertown is so authentic a cowboy from the old west could 
ride in and feel at home 
an entire town was built on a ranch east of vancouver canada 
for the halfhour weekly western series on the family channel 
sixtyfive carpenters worked 5 weeks to build the halfmillion 
dollar town 
every building is complete inside and out said comar who 
stars as us marshal jack craddock 
we film everything there with no studio work at all in the 
winter the streets are muddy the prop people came in and in the 
general store for instance they stocked every shelf and drawer 
if you open the lace drawer theres lace in it the saloon has 
antique bottles the livery stable has period tack and the saddles 
are a hundred years old 
the show is set in a town that straddles the uscanadian 
border comar plays a gunfighterturnedmarshal while john brennan 
is clive bennett a canadian mountie who goes strictly by the book 
french actress sophie barjac also costars as the town doctor it 
is a joint canadianfrench production that will also be shown in 
canada france germany and italy 
comar said he compares craddock to a new york street cop and 
bennett to a london bobby craddock is a functioning illiterate who 
is a pack rat and is terribly disorganized bennett is very 
organized and a member of a semimilitary organization they have a 
bit of an odd couple relationship 
the authentic town and props help us get the feeling of what 
the west was like comar said on a visit here he was attired in 
his costume chaps a handmade gun belt and a heavyduty cotton 
shirt with a bib front that can be taken off when it gets dirty 
craddocks looking for a soft place to retire hes a former 
texas ranger he worked on a ranch near laredo and killed a mexican 
ranchers son while stealing horses in mexico in retaliation they 
killed his son and daughter thats when he went to bordertown to 
ease the pain 
the western series has made a small comeback on the networks 
which have two shows this year cbs paradise and abcs the 
young riders but the western is thriving on the family channel 
in addition to bordertown the cable network as gunsmoke 
wagon train bonanza the lost episodes the big valley 
and the rifleman 
on saturdays and sundays the westerns start at 1130 am edt 
with roy rogers 
the family channel has also ordered a new version of zorro 
to be made in spain 
theyre considering a twohour bordertown movie comar 
said it would be the pilot we never made it would be great to 
get a superior story and to be able to flesh it out 
we sometimes have a guest villain on the show but we try to 
concentrate on human relations the things that are happening in 
the town people get tired of violence so the jeopardy caused by 
the bad guys is secondary weve also had stories about real 
people in one show bat masterson came to town trailing four men 
in another president garfields life is threatened when he comes 
to town hes assassinated elsewhere however 
comar is a former stage manager and lighting director for rock 
groups and ballet companies he lived in paris for two years and 
worked there off and on for six to eight years 
during time off from bordertown he went to new zealand to 
costar with susanna york in an episode of the ray bradbury 
theater last summer he played a television executive in the 
home box office miniseries glory glory he was an fbi agent in 
the cbs miniseries echoes in the darkness and had roles is the 
movies switching channels short circuit ii and big 
town 
my wife leslie and i moved to los angeles a year ago but 
weve only spent three months in our house he said ive been 
working in canada or new zealand were expecting our first child 
on labor day 
comar said when he auditioned for bordertown it was for the 
role of the mountie 
im welleducated im neat i hate guns he said im the 
complete opposite of craddock my wife hates it that i dont shave 
for five months she doesnt mind the long hair

british investment in south africa is still 
thriving according to a study released amid renewed international 
pressure on athletes and businesses to protest apartheid 
more than 200 british companies have subsidiaries in south 
africa despite substantial disinvestment in the past three years 
to protest the governments rigid policies of racial separation 
says the report released tuesday by the labor research department 
the 20 largest of these companies employ a total of 230000 
people in south africa according to the department a leftist 
trade union research organization 
prime minister margaret thatchers government opposes mandatory 
economic sanctions saying they would hurt the majority black 
population and neighboring black states more than south africas 
white governing minority 
but a group of foreign ministers from the commonwealth agreed 
tuesday to recommend the 48nation organization of britain and its 
former colonies adopt a new package of financial sanctions against 
south africa 
the ministers also condemned renewed sporting contacts with 
south africa which threaten the 1990 commonwealth games in new 
zealand 
sixteen english cricket players have accepted invitations to 
play in south africa in the next two years and australian and 
british rugby players have been asked to compete there later this 
month 
according to the investment report the biggest british interest 
in south africa is the diversified mining company consolidated gold 
fields plc which has a 38 percent stake in gold fields of south 
africa the gold and coal mining concern employs more than 102000 
workers 
however hanson plc said monday it had completed a takeover of 
consolidated gold fields and has said it will sell the mining 
companys south african interests 
that would leave imperial chemical industries plc in top place 
with a 38 percent stake in aeci the south african chemicals 
company which employs 26500 workers the report said 
lonrho plc ranks third with interests in platinum coal and 
gold mines employing 9428 workers 
the report said lonrho apparently has twice ignored voluntary 
european economic community codes which seek to prevent new 
investment in south africa since 1986 lonrho has raised its stake 
in western platinum from 50 to 99 percent and revealed its 100 
percent ownership of eastern platinum 
other major british employers in south africa include trafalgar 
house unilever pilkington boc group btr bat industries 
rollsroyce rtz blue circle industries great universal stores 
and cadbury schweppes the report states 
rollsroyce recently joined the list by acquiring northern 
engineering industries which the report says profits from 
international sanctions by manufacturing car engines that are no 
longer built locally because other american and british car makers 
have left 
several major british companies have pulled out of south africa 
in recent years the report says including the two big banks 
barclays plc and standard chartered the packaging firm metal box 
cable company bicc and engineering firms imi and glynwed 
the antiapartheid movement estimates total direct and indirect 
investment in south africa by british companies was about 1024 
billion down from about 126 billion in 1987 britain is south 
africas thirdlargest trading partner behind japan and west 
germany 
tuesdays report says the disinvestment campaign has had more 
success in the united states than in britain in part because 
municipal and educational bodies have threatened to cancel large 
contracts if companies did not sever their south african ties

industry analysts and wall street welcomed the 
decision by frederick wang to resign as president of the troubled 
computer company founded by his father 
share prices in wang laboratories inc jumped 20 percent after 
the announcement tuesday 
analysts said wangs resignation signaled the lowellbased 
companys intention to get serious about its problems which 
include a recently announced 375 million quarterly loss 
like a general who lost a battle he accepted responsibility 
and it will have a beneficial effect on wall street said michael 
geran a computer analyst at nikko securities co international inc 
the stock rose to 687 a share from 575 on the american 
stock exchange 
still some analysts said the company will have trouble finding 
a strong independent manager to lead it out of its troubles as 
long as an wang the companys 69yearold founder and chairman 
continues to exert control 
a good aggressive executive doesnt want to be no 2 said 
john jones of montgomery securities inc in san francisco 
the 11member board of directors assembled for a special meeting 
monday night at wang headquarters and the younger wang resigned as 
president and chief operating officer 
the board named as acting president harry hs chou currently a 
vice chairman and director of the international computer maker a 
search committee for a new president was formed 
frederick wang 38 is a computer mathematician who worked in 
the family business for 17 years he was elevated to the presidency 
in 1986 
there is a general perception that fred wang was in over his 
head but he was dealing with basic change in the minicomputer 
business geran said 
i believe this action is in the best interest of wang 
laboratories at this time fred wang said in a statement 
employees and customers will be best served by a speedy 
resolution to the companys current situation 
an wang in a statement called his sons resignation in 
keeping with his constant devotion to doing what he felt was in the 
best interest of the company 
in november 1986 the elder wang stepped down as president and 
was replaced by his son but retained the job of chief executive 
officer the day his son resigned an wang had returned to work 
parttime after recovering from surgery for cancer of the esophagus 
the younger wang will remain on the board and undertake special 
projects 
prospects for the company depend on the health of the 
doctor jones said referring to the elder wang who holds a 
doctorate from harvard in computer science and often is called by 
that title if the doctors healthy theyll bring in a president 
and theyll try to resurrect themselves 
the wangs hold a controlling interest in the company and have 
resisted any suggestion they sell it preferring instead to try to 
get the business back on its feet 
jones the montgomery securities analyst said stockholders 
would benefit most if the company were sold or at the very least 
if an wang stepped out of the way 
last week the company announced a 375 million quarterly loss 
and said it it suspended dividend payments its financial 
predicament put it in violation of a banklending agreement the 
company noted 
most of the quarterly loss resulted from a 237 million pretax 
charge to cover the cost of a restructuring that involved closing 
factories cutting jobs in its worldwide work force of 28000 
people and lowering the book value of outdated assets 
wang stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since 
early 1984 when it traded at more than 35 a share 
founded in 1951 the company made its reputation in the 1970s in 
office word processors but sales began to slip with the increasing 
popularity of personal computers its minicomputer business fell 
behind as well eclipsed by workstations 
paul henning a wang spokesman said tuesday of the resignation 
we wanted to give a consistent message that we are doing 
everything and anything possible even taking steps that are 
painful he said 
we have a lot of work to do he said

land and ellen dolan became without intending to or knowing how 
a fledgling entrepreneur 
a couple of months after amtex started its office manager quit 
and i was drafted to make this thing work because i was the 
only unemployed wife said mrs dolan 
i came in here with no accounts and empty files i couldnt 
run the typewriter i couldnt understand the concept every night 
id leave here crying i had no idea what i was supposed to do 
sell soybeans to japan impossible 
today amtex represents 41 companies and is aggressively looking 
for more mrs dolan and mrs jackson 37 who volunteered to 
help ellen get caught up and then we never did say they still 
havent made any money but they agree that every day they go to 
work they feel as if theyll land a big contract 
enthusiasm is the key to this were opportunistic were 
tenacious said mrs dolan we keep reminding ourselves we sold 
oat bran cereal to walmart if we did it once we can do it 
again 
it was their first big sale full of hilarious foulups and 
tough lessons 
i wrote sam walton founder of walmart a letter and told him 
about amtex then months went by one day i got a collect call from 
the head food buyer who wanted us to come to bentonville ark 
walmart headquarters and show him our products i told him id 
have to call him back because neither of us had ever driven through 
kansas city 
laughing hard at the memory mrs jackson said i panicked and 
told ellen oh no i can only drive to the missouri river i 
cant cross it it was like a phobia neither one of us had ever 
ever driven in freeway traffic 
but after giving each other pep talks they called walmart 
buyer joe craig back and said theyd come 
we drove through kansas city whiteknuckle all the way sick 
at our stomachs convinced we would die on the freeway mrs 
dolan said then we just knew wed never find arkansas then we 
were afraid wed never find walmart in bentonville which is 
ludicrous looking back on it because its as big as the un 
buyer craig now working in another walmart division remembers 
them as pretty sharp openminded and professional i was 
impressed with them from the beginning 
it took 18 months to close the deal said mrs dolan and in 
that time there was a worldwide oats shortage not enough cardboard 
to make the cereal boxes the original oat bran maker was bought by 
another company and joe craig was transferred 
along the way the women got to know every restaurant in 
bentonville and just about every walmart receptionist 
some days this job makes us crazy said mrs jackson and 
other days it feeds our souls 
every letter amtex sends begins good day from trenton 
missouri usa correspondence wings its way from a 10by12 foot 
cubicle on main street in this town of 7000 to countries all over 
the world as well as hundreds of potential domestic clients 
in return we get letters that begin an exceedingly good day 
from singapore said mrs dolan its a thrill because we 
dont send threeparagraph corporate letters we extend a hand in 
friendship and offer barbecue sauce on the side 
when we get an overseas call we tell em right off that were 
just two farm women in a small office and were just getting 
started so dont expect a huge staff with bmas from harvard or 
whatever those fancy degrees are 
added mrs jackson somebody in japan wanted an amtex flow 
chart i went home and asked my husband honey whats a flow 
chart 
they may not know the jargon but they put in 10hour days 
trying to market foods such as smoked meats bee pollen popcorn 
missouri wine and stoneground flour as well as homemade lawn 
furniture and firewood 
from the beginning amtex sought help from the missouri 
department of agriculture and the us department of agricultures 
foreign service branch which publishes descriptions of american 
products available for export 
we operate on a shoestring so weve become aggressive 
guerrilla marketers said mrs jackson explaining they use a 
network of government services to make contacts 
the two friends and coworkers also have become experts in 
minutiae trivia and exotica 
we got a call from switzerland asking us if we had boletus 
edilus said mrs dolan neither of us had the vaguest idea 
what that was but we thought it might be a plant we went home 
found out in the encyclopedia it was a dried mushroom tracked some 
down in poland and put the supplier and the buyer together by 
telex 
they also know where to find warrisk insurance how to get 
labeling in arabic and which freight forwarders are most efficient 
in indonesia 
their jobs have changed them and opened new vistas in lives once 
focused almost exclusively on home and family 
joy used to make wedding gowns and i used to watch the birds 
feed said mrs dolan amtex is my canvas i talk about 
nurturing it the same way i used to talk about raising my boys 
this is everything i never thought id do

americans took out 299 billion more in 
consumer debt than they retired in june the government reported 
as the pace of borrowing slowed in part because of declining auto 
sales 
the federal reserve board said tuesday that consumer credit in 
june rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 51 percent down 
from mays revised 73 percent rate the may increase was revised 
from 36 billion to 42 billion 
consumer credit increased 43 percent in april after rising 66 
percent in march and 95 percent in february 
consumer credit increased 85 percent over all of 1988 
consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of the 
economys health since it represents twothirds of overall economic 
activity 
economic growth has been slowing recently prompting concern 
that federal reserve efforts to contain inflation could move the 
economy into a recession instead of the softlanding it seeks 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group a consulting firm 
here said the fact that consumer spending does not appear to be 
collapsing helps take the heat of the economy and reduce 
inflationary pressures 
the commerce department reported earlier that retail sales had 
fallen 04 percent in june dragged down in part by poor sales of 
autos but excluding the automotive category overall retail sales 
actually rose 01 percent it said 
the fed reported tuesday that auto loans fell 267 million in 
june a 11 percent decline on a seasonally adjusted annual basis 
they had risen 45 percent in may and 33 percent in april 
but ms shaber said car sales increased in july so i think 
that the business of liquidating car loans is a very temporary kind 
of phenomena thats not going to continue and you might see a 
little bit of increase in car loans in july 
leading the overall consumer credit increase in june was the 
category of debt that includes credit cards it rose 31 billion 
a 20 percent annual rate of growth after increasing 13 percent in 
may and 11 percent in april 
ms shaber said this reflects a shift toward retail credit to 
soft goods like apparel and small items 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased 
404 million a 25 percent annual rate of advance but down from 
72 percent in may and 28 percent in april 
borrowing for mobile homes fell for the fifth consecutive month 
declining by 257 million or 129 percent on an annual basis that 
followed drops of 2l percent in may and 87 percent in april 
the various changes left total consumer debt in june at a 
seasonally adjusted 70119 billion

executives of the nations two largest 
spanishlanguage television operations say they will be better 
equipped to compete for advertising dollars once a new national 
hispanic television rating service is in operation 
nielsen media researchs service will attempt to define the 
audience for spanishlanguage programming among people who identify 
themselves as hispanic information one executive called critical 
to the growth of the medium 
nielsen the leader in englishlanguage tv ratings for nearly 40 
years said tuesday it had signed a multimilliondollar contract to 
develop the hispanic ratings service with the two largest 
spanishlanguage television operators univision holdings inc and 
telemundo group inc 
for several months univision and telemundo have been reviewing 
proposals from a halfdozen research firms for an hispanic audience 
measurement system 
executives of the two companies said the nielsen hispanic 
ratings will help them attract spending by advertisers and agencies 
who in the past have been skeptical about the estimated size of the 
spanishlanguage tv audience 
univision a subsidiary of hallmark cards inc is the nations 
largest spanishlanguage communications concern operating a tv 
network reaching 85 percent of the estimated 6 million hispanic 
households 
telemundo group operates the nations secondlargest 
spanishlanguage network reaching about 70 percent of all hispanic 
households 
plans for the hispanic ratings service disclosed at a news 
conference here call for a pilot test beginning this fall in the 
los angeles area which has a large hispanic population nielsen 
plans to begin recruiting 200 families for the sample group there 
starting next month 
nielsen a division of dun amp bradstreet corp plans to expand 
the service nationally to 800 hispanic households in late 1990 or 
early 1991 nielsens national sample for all programming is about 
4000 families of all kinds 
carlos e garcia research director for the firm research 
resources in agoura hills calif said the hispanic population has 
been growing much more rapidly than the general population and is 
expected next year to reach 22 million or about 10 percent of the 
total us population 
there is some evidence that advertisers are beginning to 
recognize the economic clout that this group represents which 
garcia said the government estimates at 160 billion this year 
hispanic business magazine estimated that 50 leading advertisers 
spent 5001 million on advertising to the hispanic market last 
year up 12 percent from 4907 million a year earlier 
in the past week companies such as cocacola co and burger 
king corp have announced plans to increase their efforts at 
reaching hispanics with spanishlanguage advertising 
but henry r silverman chief executive of telemundo group said 
advertisers are spending less than 1 percent of their estimated 30 
billion annual television ad budgets on spanishlanguage stations 
he said one reason was skepticism about the size of the audience 
for spanishlanguage programs 
telemundo and univision subscribe to a ratings service that uses 
weekly interviews to estimate their audience size he said 
silverman said he expects the nielsen ratings to confirm that 60 
percent to 70 percent of hispanic households are watching 
spanishlanguage television and that once advertisers recognize it 
their spending on the medium will rise 
nielsen plans to use socalled people meters for the 
spanishlanguage program ratings the electronic devices allow 
people to push buttons that immediately record who in the family is 
watching particular shows 
nielsen has been using people meters for its national 
englishlanguage ratings service for two years 
j william grimes president and chief executive of univision 
holdings said spanishlanguage television networks face the same 
problems in dealing with advertisers as cable networks faced in the 
early 1980s before nielsen started measuring their audiences 
he said programming improvements and nielsen audience ratings 
enabled cable networks to boost ad revenues to about 13 billion 
this year from 50 million at the start of the 1980s 
grimes said the quality of spanishlanguage programming is a 
long way beyond where cable tv was at the start of the decade and 
said the new nielsen ratings could prove critical to the growth 
of spanishlanguage tv

in the wake of ampcopittsburgh corps 
announcement that it has acquired a 66 percent interest in midway 
airlines inc the carriers management is waiting to see whether 
the suitor will seek control 
ampcopittsburgh said in a document submitted to the securities 
and exchange commission that it had acquired 662000 shares of 
midway common stock through a delaware subsidiary ampcopittsburgh 
securities iii corp the filing was made public tuesday 
ampcopittsburgh has not contacted the company in connection 
with this investment said david r hinson chairman and chief 
executive officer of chicagobased midway 
the manufacturing concern said it bought the midway shares for 
investment and to acquire a significant equity interest in the 
airline 
midways stock reacted favorably to the disclosure in composite 
new york stock exchange trading it climbed 150 a share to close 
at 2050 
the sec disclosure document said pittsburghbased ampco may 
also consider seeking to acquire control of midway in the 
future although they have no plans or proposals to do so at 
present 
according to the filing ampcopittsburgh securities iii bought 
the midway shares at prices ranging from 1475 to 18 between july 
25 and last thursday for a total of 103 million 
hinson said thursday that midway had not been approached by 
anyone seeking to take over the airline despite heavy trading in 
the companys stock 
midway has no interest in being acquired he said 
attributing the stock activity to new interest in airlines as 
takeover targets 
midway was founded 10 years ago at the start of airline 
deregulation when it served three midwest cities from chicago 
cleveland detroit and kansas city said spokeswoman sandra allen 
the airline now serves 51 us cities from los angeles to 
boston and from chicago to miami she said 
midway recently announced it had ordered 74 new jets from 
mcdonnelldouglas worth about 2 billion 
the airline the nations 16thlargest carrier operates from 
midway airport on chicagos southwest side and has 4300 employees 
ms allen said 
ampcopittsburgh and its subsidiaries which include buffalo 
forge co and union electric steel corp make and sell engineered 
products ampco is the sole shareholder in the subsidiary holding 
the airline stock 
the company is a mystery to some airline analysts 
they arent a big player said bob joedicke an analyst for 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york ive never heard of 
them 
joedicke described midway as a niche carrier handling just 
08 percent of the nations air traffic 
their niche is that they dominate midway airport in chicago 
which is much closer to downtown than ohare he said 
it has the advantage that a lot of businessmen appreciate 
coming into midway from new york joedicke said he said the 
carrier has developed quite a successful hub in chicago for 
eastwest traffic 
last week midway announced it had reached a 210 million deal 
with miamibased eastern airlines to purchase routes gates and 
aircraft from the strikeplagued carrier 
the agreement must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court 
judge as part of easterns strikerecovery plan to restructure into 
a smaller airline

compagnie financiere de suez says it is launching 
frances biggest ever takeover bid in a hostile offer for 
compagnie industrielle with which it shares control of groupe 
victoire a major french insurance group 
the takeover proposal by suez a parisbased holding company 
which traces its history to the financing of the suez canal more 
than a century ago was said to be worth about 25 billion 
suez shares fell sharply in early trading today reflecting 
concern that the company is in for a long tough battle that will 
be costly even if it wins 
the price dropped from 369 francs 5766 per share at 
tuesdays close to 347 francs 5422 just after todays opening 
but then rebounded to 355 francs 5547 at midday 
suez said tuesday that if the bid is successful it will then 
make a tender offer for victoires parent company compagnie 
financiere du groupe victoire 
the paris stock exchange said in a statement that suez is 
offering to pay 13000 francs 2030 per share for the 8153 
percent of compagnie industrielle stock it does not already own 
that would value the target companys total stock at 195 
billion francs about 3 billion and the suez offer would total 
159 billion francs about 25 billion 
the previous record french takeover was a bid last year by 
schneider sa of about 930 million for control of telemecanique 
electrique sa 
but the success of the suez bid is far from assured with 
jeanmarc vernes president of compagnie industrielle expected to 
put up a tough resistance 
suez wants a majority and im categorically opposed vernes 
was quoted as saying in wednesdays edition of the daily le figaro 
i made proposals for an arrangement but if we have to go to 
battle we will 
last year suez won a bruising takeover battle with italian 
financier carlo de benedetti for control of the huge belgian 
holding company societe generale de belgique 
groupe victoire became much more attractive after making a 
friendly acquisition last month of west germanys secondlargest 
insurer colonia versicherung ag suez said its bid would not 
affect the colonia takeover 
compagnie industrielles shares were last quoted on the paris 
bourse at 9750 francs 1525 before being suspended last friday

a simpler car is in chrysler corps 
future as consumers find themselves overwhelmed by an array of 
options and gadgets the companys design chief says 
tom gale vice president for design at the nations no 3 
automaker said tuesday that car buyers are overloaded with choices 
to make when buying a car or truck 
when you look at the marketplace of the future where we have 
the greatest opportunity is this whole field of back to basics 
he said 
however he cautioned that cars cant look incomplete like 
basic cars of the past that had obvious places for clocks or 
airconditioning units 
in a much larger sense thats what were struggling with on 
how we handle the next generation of platforms he said 
chrysler will be introducing a new basic design in late 1992 for 
the 1993 model year in gales world of designing for the future 
the cars that are built on those platforms are in the works today 
when you get to a world where there are so many things where 
there is so much technology and theres so many models different 
models in different variations of those models after a while its 
a blur gale said 
i think what the marketplace is telling us and what consumers 
are telling us is hey were waiting for the guy who comes along 
and just says heres my chrysler heres my dodge 
during last winters carshow circuit chrysler exhibited its 
dodge viper concept car a twoseater stripped of a lot of the 
electronics that have made other cars more complex machines 
company chairman lee iacocca has said a decision will be made on 
whether to produce the viper by early next year and executives 
have said chrysler should build it 
however there is concern over whether it is economically wise 
to build the car amid predictions of a continuing slowdown in car 
and truck sales and a general softening of the us economy 
two weeks ago chryslers top 700 managers met in detroit and 
heard iacocca outline a program aimed at taking 1 billion out of 
the companys costs included will be a reduction in the 
whitecollar work force by about 2300 people or just more than 8 
percent 
company executives said no plants would be closed and product 
development plans would remain in place during the costcutting 
gale said his department wasnt exempt from the cost reductions

a group of retired general motors corp workers 
have sued the automaker saying gm reneged on healthcare coverage 
promises 
the group filed a classaction lawsuit tuesday in federal court 
in los angeles on behalf of more than 80000 salaried retirees 
most of whom live in michigan florida california and ohio 
the suit said the company last year eliminated or reduced some 
coverage for the retirees including chiropractic and psychiatric 
care and imposed copayments and deductibles on basic health 
coverage 
the suit seeks restoration of benefits and compensation for 
those who paid the deductibles and copayments 
gm spokeswoman patricia malloy said the company had no comment 
on the suit because it had not had time to study it 
gm said we would have these benefits for our lifetimes said 
leonard moeller of fenton mich i felt we had a moral and legal 
contract 
they cant take it away now said moeller an accountant who 
retired in 1982 
malloy said all salaried gm workers should have known that their 
health care benefits could change she said last years changes 
were made to encourage active and retired employees to switch to 
more economical health care plans such as health maintenance 
organizations 
currently gm salaried workers have to pay the first 200 of 
medical costs annually and 20 percent of other costs with a 500 
ceiling thus a worker could spend up to 700 a year for health 
care the family limit is 750 a year 
we are all on fixed incomes and we are all at a state in our 
lives when we truly need all of the health benefits that gm 
promised us during our working years moeller said 
moeller said the suit was filed in los angeles because a retiree 
group is active there and that gm may have too much influence if 
the case was filed in michigan

dart drug stores inc faced with high 
debt payments and costs of extensive store renovations has filed 
for protection from creditors under the federal bankruptcy code 
company chairman sheldon fantle said the board of directors 
concluded the company could not continue to make payments on its 
debt much of which was incurred by prior owners who bought the 
chain from founder herbert haft in 1984 for 160 million 
our board determined that it was far better to take this step 
now while our company has substantial resources to implement a 
plan of reorganization 
this makes a lot of sense said kenneth m gassman jr an 
analyst with wheat first securities inc of richmond 
emotionally it was hard for them to make that decision but over 
the long term the company will emerge much stronger because it 
allows them to renegotiate its longterm debt 
fantle led a group of investors that took over management of the 
company in november 1987 at that time dart owed more than 164 
million to bondholders and to its bank lenders it has paid more 
than 26 million in principal and interest payments on that debt 
dart operates 69 retail drug stores in washington dc 
maryland and virginia and five totalplus discount stores in the 
richmond area dart has more than 2000 employees and had sales of 
about 170 million in the fiscal year ended in 1989 
its loss in the third quarter ended april 29 narrowed to 73 
million from 96 million last year revenue in the first nine 
months fell 26 percent to 1288 million from 1749 million a 
year ago 
haft founded dart drug stores in 1954 he sold the company to a 
management group in 1984 before going on to make a series of 
unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts under the mantle of his 
dart group corp which is unrelated to the drugstore chain 
fantle attempted to revamp the company by remodeling stores 
placing new emphasis on customer service a financial restructuring 
and an unusual plan to donate 5 percent of the companys gross 
receipts to charity 
the company filed a petition in us bankruptcy court in 
rockville md placing dart and its subsidiaries under the 
protection of the bankruptcy court while the company prepares a 
plan of reorganization 
under the provisions of chapter 11 the current management will 
continue operating dart drug stores under the supervision of the 
bankruptcy court while the daytoday operations will be up to 
management major actions such as borrowing money would be subject 
to approval of the court 
in several motions tuesday to the bankruptcy court dart sought 
to arrange up to 30 million in new financing from the mellon bank 
of pittsburgh pa those funds would allow the business to pay its 
existing secured creditors and provide a revolving line of credit 
for working capital 
the company also said employees will be paid this friday 
dart also wants to obtain approval to continue making payments 
to charities under its good neighbor fund program

united airlines has found a small crack in 
a fourth boeing 727100 jetliner since the federal aviation 
administration ordered an industrywide inspection in july 
the faa reported tuesday that to date cracks have been found in 
the metallic skins of four united 727s and one american airlines 
727 the cracks ranged in size from 20 inches to less than half an 
inch 
chicagobased united the nations secondlargest airline 
previously reported finding cracks in three planes 
the faa is considering whether to order continuing inspections 
of the 31 oldest 727s registered in the united states said agency 
spokesman david duff the inspections might also be broadened to 
include somewhat newer 727100s as well he said 
the cracks first discovered on united jets occur on the seam 
that joins the upper and lower parts of the fuselage boeing co 
modified the way the seam was joined after building the first 46 
727s increasing the thickness of the splice by inserting a spacer 
piece of metal between the overlapping fuselage sections 
we had never seen cracking along the lower rivet row at the 
splice duff said this was something new 
though the cracks safety implication is not fully understood 
the faa issued an emergency directive ordering airlines to inspect 
the aging 727s for the fuselage cracks and not to fly the planes 
until they were inspected and any cracks repaired 
the united and american planes have been repaired and are back 
in service 
each of the planes had accumulated 46000 to 49000 flights 
boeing had billed the planes as having a design life cycle of 20 
years and 60000 flights said tom cole a boeing spokesman 
boeing still believes the planes can fly indefinitely with 
proper maintenance cole said

hoylake investments ltd has released details of 
its cashless offer for bat industries plc but bat again advised 
shareholders not to accept the offer valued at some 216 billion 
in a new twist in hoylakes pursuit of the big british 
conglomerate former us treasury secretary william e simon 
emerged as an investor in the proposed deal and may be interested 
in buying bats farmers group inc insurance division according to 
a report published today 
hoylake said it values its stockanddebt offer for bat at the 
equivalent of 1414 a share but the stock closed at 1365 a 
share tuesday on londons stock exchange up 5 cents 
the filing of an offer document is a normal step in british 
takeover procedures the offer must now stay open at least 21 days 
hoylake consisting of anglofrench financier sir james 
goldsmith british merchant banker jacob rothschild australian 
investor kerry packer and other investors said tuesday the group 
wouldnt specify how it might make the debt package behind their 
takeover offer more marketable until after the bids standing with 
us regulators is clear 
for every 100 ordinary bat shares hoylake would pay hoylake 
variableinteres senior secured notes valued at 684 subordinated 
hoylake notes valued at 41820 and 274 worth of hoylake 
exchangeable loan stock convertible into 387 shares of anglo group 
plc a goldsmith company 
later bat issued a statement from the louisville ky 
headquarters of its us subsidiary batus inc reiterating its 
rejection of the proposed buyout and advising stockholders not to 
sell their shares 
bat which is the worlds biggest tobacco company said its 
international concentration on growth businesses had paid off with 
a 38 percent compound return to shareholders since 1980 and there 
was continued potential for rapid earnings growth 
bat chairman patrick sheehy stated that the hoylake offer 
ignored those prospects and consisted of securities of dubious 
value 
the scheme is principally designed to enrich messrs 
goldsmith rothschild and packer at the expense of bat industries 
shareholders sheehy stated 
some of bats institutional investors have attacked the bids 
lack of cash and of any assurance that the debt offered in exchange 
for bat shares would be tradable 
goldsmith said the group couldnt speculate on how and when all 
the details of the debt package would come to light but said 
bankers trust international and drexel burnham lambert inc 
wouldnt have lent their names to such an effort if the 
securities couldnt be made liquid 
the wall street journal reported that the unexpected 
intervention of simon in the proposed acquisition of bat which 
would be europes biggest takeover could lend credibility to the 
takeover attempt led by goldsmith 
simon told the journal that you have to consider bill simon an 
interested player in any goldsmith sale of farmers which bat 
acquired late last year for 52 billion 
goldsmith has indicated that if he prevails in his quest for bat 
he would retain the companys tobacco business and sell its retail 
paper and financial services divisions besides farmers bats us 
operations include the retail chains saks fifth avenue and marshall 
field 
in an interview with the newspaper simon described his interest 
in farmers as preliminary and he said there werent any firm plans 
for a sale of farmers by hoylake 
the bid for bat is being reviewed by us insurance regulators 
the hoylake investors intend to explore whether it makes a 
difference to us regulators whether it is simon who ends up 
acquiring farmers said simon who has become a pioneer of 
leveraged buyouts since leaving government service 
bat has been lobbying the british government to investigate the 
proposed takeover on the grounds that the highly leveraged 
financing was against the public interest

corn futures were lower but soybeans and wheat 
prices moved marginally higher today on the chicago board of trade 
the dip in corn prices was attributed to the unusually high 
estimate of crop production released tuesday by influential private 
forecaster conrad leslie 
although leslies forecast for soybeans was bearish as well 
most traders apparently thought a late wave of selling at tuesdays 
close was overdone and few sellers materialized after the opening 
bell today 
price swings may be at a minimum over the next two days in all 
the grain pits as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of 
thursdays us department of agriculture report on actual crop 
production 
at the open wheat was unchanged to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 392 cents a bushel corn 
was cent to 1 cents lower with september at 224 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with september at 139 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 8 cents higher with august at 
600 a bushel

the justice department is asking several 
prestigious universities for documents as part of an antitrust 
investigation into how they set tuition and student aid rates 
officials say 
the department while declining to discuss the thrust of the 
investigation acknowledged that it is seeking certain documents 
daniel steiner general counsel at harvard university said the 
request was for documents dealing with student financial aid 
budgeting and other fees and salaries 
jonathan kleinbard vice president for news and community 
affairs at the university of chicago said today that his 
institution was cooperating with a justice department request for 
information concerning the procedures by which it establishes its 
tuition 
specifically the department is interested in whether 
institutions of higher education have entered into arrangements or 
understandings as to prospective tuition rates that may violate 
federal antitrust laws he said 
at no time has the university of chicago participated in any 
agreement or understanding with any other institution as to the 
setting of its tuition kleinbard said when asked about possible 
agreements relating to financial aid he said we dont do it 
pure and simple 
justice department spokesman david runkel confirmed that 
document requests have gone out to a number of colleges but he 
declined to disclose the subjects of the request 
antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public 
record he said 
you can say this is in a preliminary stage runkel said 
adding that the first requests were made sometime earlier this 
summer perhaps six weeks ago 
essentially theyve asked us to produce a lot of documents 
with regard to our budget how we budget richard mersereau a 
spokesman for brunswick maines bowdoin college told the 
associated press its an extensive amount of documentation and 
we are complying 
universities have shared financial information about students 
for years even arranging to use copies of a single financial 
statement submitted by parents of applicants seeking scholarships 
and other aid 
there have been reports that major universities agree among 
themselves on the aid packages to be offered generally mixtures of 
scholarships loans and campus jobs such agreements if they 
exist would be of interest to the antitrust division which 
enforces the legal ban against pricefixing by private commercial 
companies 
there are wellknown aid agreements among universities such as 
limits on athletic scholarships that members of the national 
collegiate athletic association may offer members of the ivy 
league have agreed not to offer athletic scholarships and to base 
offers of financial aid on student need 
harvards steiner declined to say whether cooperating 
universities agree on aid packages to be offered to applicants 
the washington post said in todays editions the departments 
requests had gone to 20 institutions among them harvard colby 
amherst williams and bowdoin colleges tufts and wesleyan 
universities and the university of chicago 
harvard will be cooperating with the justice department in 
giving them the data theyve requested steiner said 
at neighboring tufts university in medford mass spokeswoman 
rosemarie van camp said we will cooperate fully with the justice 
department 
colby spokesman edward hershey also confirmed that the school 
had been served and had turned the matter over to counsel 
they have asked for certain documents and we will im sure 
attempt to respond appropriately he said

cummins engine co inc wednesday said it 
amended provisions of its shareholders rights plan to lower the 
amount of common stock a shareholder must own to be eligibile 
the amendment lowers from 25 percent to 15 percent the ownership 
of the companys common stock that results in the rights kicking 
in said ann c smith public relations director of cummins which 
produces diesel engines components and power systems 
ms smith said the amendment would have no immediate effect 
since no one shareholder has acquired 15 percent of the companys 
common stock 
last december the us arm of the british conglomerate hanson 
plc announced it had acquired 832 percent of cummins common 
stock then filed for permission to increase its holdings up to 15 
percent 
last month cummins 80yearold former chairman j irwin 
miller and other family members bought back the shares to allay 
fears the enginemaker might be bought and moved 
nine days later industrial equity pacific ltd a hong 
kongbased investment concern paid 602 million for 101 million 
shares or 99 percent of common stock iep filed for permission 
from the securities and exchange commission to increase its stake 
to between 15 percent and 25 percent 
iep officials have said the purchase was made for investment and 
takeover purposes 
all of these factors were considered by the board when it 
inacted the amendment ms smith said today 
the company adopted its shareholder rights plan three years ago 
and declared a dividend of one right per outstanding share of 
common stock when the rights become effective they entitle the 
holder to buy one share of common stock for 200 under certain 
circumstances the rights entitle the stockholder to purchase for 
200 common stock with a market value of two times the purchase 
price

president bush today signed farreaching 
legislation to rescue the nations ailing savings and loan 
industry calling the measure a first step a crucial step 
toward restoring public confidence 
im proud to sign this monster bush said at a rose garden 
ceremony attended by architects of the nearly foothigh bill which 
authorizes 50 billion in new government borrowing over the next 26 
months 
the bill also imposes tough new standards on savings and loan 
institutions and triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the 
regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years 
along with the latemorning signing of the measure the 
president was ordering his administration to gear up to close or 
merge hundreds of failed institutions the first meeting of a new 
board to oversee their holdings was called immediately after the 
ceremony 
bush said the measure which received final congressional 
approval saturday says to tens of millions of savings and loan 
depositors you will not be the victims of others mistakes 
among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were treasury 
secretary nicholas brady housing and urban development secretary 
jack kemp and key capitol hill sponsors including sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich and rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairmen 
of the congressional banking committees 
to the presidents right were mockups of the new emblems that 
the institutions will put on their doors to assure depositors their 
money is safe 
one proclaims in bold white letters against a gold background 
deposits federally insured backed up by the full faith and 
credit of the united states government 
this legislation comes to grips with the problems facing our 
savings and loan industry it will safeguard and stabilize 
americas financial system bush declared 
he called the measure a variation on a bailout plan he 
submitted to congress on feb 6 historic legislation 
it is responsive and responsible and for that i salute the 
congress the president said 
immediately after the signing ceremony brady was conducting the 
first meeting of the board overseeing the resolution trust corp 
the rtc was created to manage the sale of sour loans and 
repossessed real estate the government is inheriting from ailing 
savings and loans 
the rtc board whose members also include kemp and federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan will approve operating policies 
for the federal deposit insurance corp the agency charged with 
managing the bailout it also will appoint top staff members to 
oversee the fdic 
the fdic already has taken over 262 failed thrifts and the 
first deals to wipe out their losses and put them in the hands of 
new owners could come as early as this week 
earlier the treasury department announced plans to borrow the 
first 5 billion installment of the bailout thursday and said it 
intends to raise an additional 15 billion within eight weeks 
analysts say the bill the first major legislative initiative of 
bushs presidency will touch the lives of anyone who pays taxes 
deposits money in a bank or thrift or owns real estate 
particularly in the southwest 
the savings and loan industry will emerge leaner and more 
closely regulated bu perhaps no better able to earn a profit 
analysts say 
by providing the money to close failed thrifts which must pay 
high interest rates to attract deposits the bill should allow 
remaining institutions including banks to lower their rates 
the massive sale of real estate by the government could endanger 
property values in already fragile markets in oilproducing states 
in such as texas and oklahoma 
thrifts that cant measure up to tougher financial and 
accounting standards face takeover by government regulators or 
merger with bigger and stronger institutions including commercial 
banks which for the first time will be permitted to buy healthy 
savings and loans 
in five years i expect therell be less than a thousand 
thrifts said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va currently there are about 3000 savings and loan 
institutions 
the prospects for thrifts that remain are mixed optimists point 
out that the bill by lowering deposit rates will make it easier 
for healthy institutions to earn a profit 
also it should restore public confidence in the governments 
guarantee of savers accounts up to 100000 helping stem a record 
outflow of deposits this year 
the industry that is going to emerge from this is going to be 
fewer in number but certainly stronger said barney r beeksma 
chairman of the us league of savings institutions the industrys 
largest trade group 
pessimists however say the industrys contribution to the 
bailout will pinch thrift earnings they also note that the bill 
will force savings and loans to concentrate more heavily on safer 
but less lucrative home mortgage lending just as the economy and 
real estate markets are entering a slowgrowth period at best and a 
recession at worst 
i think its exactly the wrong thing to do said economist 
paul getman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting 
company its consigning the thrift industry to low 
profitability at least over the next two or three years

the savings and loan industry will emerge 
leaner and more closely regulated but perhaps no better able to 
earn a profit as a result of legislation signed by president bush 
on wednesday analysts say 
the bill enacted six months after bush first called for 
emergency action to solve a crisis inherited from the reagan 
administration is expected to profoundly alter and probably 
drastically shrink a business that has enjoyed a privileged 
position in the nations financial system for more than 50 years 
savings and loans because they financed the american dream of 
home ownership have been permitted to operate under accounting 
standards and capital requirements much more lax than those applied 
to commercial banks 
no longer in 120 days thrift owners will be required to back 
every 100 in lending with 150 in tangible capital which will 
act as a cushion between future losses and government insurance 
funds by 1995 the standard will reach 3 
an estimated 77 percent of the nations 2946 sampls meet the 15 
percent standard and twothirds already satisfy the 3 percent 
requirement that is more than five years away according to 
sheshunoff amp co a consulting firm in austin texas 
those that cant measure up face takeover by government 
regulators or merger with bigger and stronger institutions because 
the legislation for the first time permits banks to buy solvent 
sampls even prosperous institutions could be quickly scooped up by 
large holding companies anxious to expand their retail branch 
network the bill makes it easier for banks to smoothly integrate 
thrifts into their operation 
in five years i expect therell be less than a thousand 
thrifts said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va five hundred to 1000 thrifts will be shut down 
by the government the rest will go because banks will seek to 
acquire them and they will seek to be acquired it will be a 
twoway street 
the prospects for thrifts that remain after the shakeout are 
mixed optimists point out that the bill by eliminating ailing 
sampls that bid up interest rates on deposits will make it easier 
for healthy institutions to raise lowcost funds 
also by putting the taxpayers money where politicians mouths 
are the bill should restore public confidence in the governments 
guarantee of savers accounts up to 100000 helping to stem a 
record outflow of deposits this year 
the industry that is going to emerge from this is going to be 
fewer in number but certainly stronger said barney r beeksma 
chairman of the us league of savings institutions the industrys 
largest trade group 
i think the positives clearly outweigh the negatives it will 
probably reduce if not eliminate the adverse publicity weve had 
by once again underscoring that government insurance of 
accounts is just that and people dont have to worry about losing 
their money said beeksma president of interwest savings bank in 
oak harbor wash 
pessimists however say that the industrys share of the 
bailout will pinch thrift earnings in two ways through higher 
deposit insurance premiums and by skimming profits from the 12 
regional industryowned federal home loan banks 
sampl losses far exceeded profits in 1987 and 1988 but embership 
in the regional banks the industrys financing arm provided 
thrifts that did make money with a third of their earnings last 
year 
the regional banks as part of the bailout are contributing all 
of their retained earnings 35 billion as well as 300 million a 
year in profits 
moreover institutions will see their deposit insurance premium 
rise by 10 percent from 208 cents per 100 to 23 cents 
pessimists also note that the bill will force sampls to 
concentrate more heavily on safer but less lucrative home mortgage 
lending just as the economy and real estate markets are entering 
into a slowgrowth period at best and a recession at worst 
thrifts are now required to devote 70 percent of their assets to 
housing loans up from a 60 percent standard that had many more 
loopholes 
i think its exactly the wrong thing to do said economist 
paul getman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting 
firm its consigning the thrift industry to low profitability 
at least over the next two or three years 
also getman warned that perversely government action to 
resolve the thrift crisis could have the effect of further 
unnerving depositors 
eventually the bailout is going to increase confidence in the 
industry but thats a ways off people are going to see 
institutions closing left and right its going to be hard to 
explain to them that were making a better industry when they see 
their local thrift going under he said

here are a few financial safety tips for travelers according to 
industry experts and consumer groups 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
keep most of your money in travelers checks theyre safer than 
cash because the issuer gives full or partial refunds for lost or 
stolen checks checks in foreign currency may be available at a 
major bank at official exchange rates usually without service fees 
carry us dollars and the currency of whatever country youre 
visiting us money should be in small denominations to handle 
minor expenses such as tips or parking before or after departure 
bring at least one major credit card for either identification 
or purchases two is better since not all cards are universally 
accepted but leave the cards you dont expect to use at home 
try to buy all your travel tickets through a credit card if 
possible its often easier to get replacement tickets and many 
creditcard companies provide limited travel insurance 
after charging meals souvenirs or other items destroy all 
charge card carbons immediately 
double check your credit card bill to ensure all purchases are 
listed correctly and contact your bank or creditcard company 
immediately if theres an incorrect expense cardholders are liable 
for up to 50 of unauthorized purchases before they report a card 
stolen or lost but theyre not liable for any purchases after a 
report is filed

compagnie industrielle will resist the largest 
takeover bid ever attempted in france a 25 billion offer from a 
former ally its president said wednesday 
jeanmarc vernes head of the holding company under attack from 
compagnie financiere de suez a parisbased bank holding company 
declined to discuss what allies he might be lining up for the fight 
suez won a long and difficult takeover battle last year with 
italian financier carlo de benedetti for control of the huge 
belgian holding company societe generale de belgique 
the prize in the takeover battle is groupe victoire frances 
secondbiggest insurance group suez which traces its corporate 
history to the financing of the suez canal more than a century ago 
currently shares control of groupe victoire with compagnie 
industrielle 
the paris stock exchange said in a statement that suez proposes 
to offer the equivalent of 2030 per share for the 815 percent of 
compagnie industrielle stock it does not already own that would 
value the target companys equity at 3 billion and the suez offer 
would total about 25 billion 
vernes was quoted by the french news agency agence francepresse 
as saying he would make no statement until the hostile takeover bid 
by suez has been approved by stock market regulatory authorities 
the regulatory decision is expected on aug 18 and if the bid 
is approved stockholders then would have a month to decide whether 
to sell at that price 
trading in compagnie industrielle stock has been frozen since 
friday it was last quoted on the paris bourse at the equivalent of 
1525 per share 
the price of suez shares fell to 5555 a share from 5766 on 
wednesday in active trading 
groupe victoire was originally part of the suez holdings but 
when it appeared likely that the socialists would win the 1981 
elections suezs president at the time jack frances quietly 
transferred control to the holding company compagnie industrielle 
which he controlled along with allies including the dassault family 
when the new socialist government indeed nationalized suez along 
with other banks and industrial firms it was surprised to find the 
groupe victoire insurance company no longer a suez subsidiary 
although suez did retain a minority interest partly direct and 
partly through compagnie industrielle 
the conservative government elected in 1986 sold suez to private 
investors but its new owners have had uneasy relations with 
vernes who succeeded frances as head of compagnie industrielle 
suez said if its takeover bid is successful it will then make a 
tender offer for the victoire insurance companys parent compagnie 
financiere du groupe victoire 
suez already owns 30 percent of groupe victoire but apparently 
is unhappy as simply a silent investor suez also owns 1847 
percent of the shares of compagnie industrielle which has 40 
percent of the capital and 48 percent of the voting rights of 
compagnie financiere du groupe victoire 
groupe victoire became much more attractive after making a 
friendly acquisition last month of west germanys secondlargest 
insurer colonia versicherung ag suez said its bid would not 
affect the colonia takeover 
suez said in a statement that its bid for victoire was part of 
its preparation for the dropping of barriers within the european 
economic community after 1992 
reports in several french newspapers wednesday said vernes would 
likely line up support from the ferruzzi group of italy to help 
fight off the suez takeover bid vernes is also president of 
beghinsay a french papermaking unit of ferruzzi 
vernes declined to comment on the reports that ferruzzi would be 
involved 
under french stock market regulations any competing bid for 
compagnie industrielle either by vernes allies or others would 
have to be at least 5 percent higher than the suez tender offer 
the main asset of compagnie industrielle is its controlling 
stake in groupe victoire it also has some real estate and minority 
industrial holdings

americans know pedro guerrero as a 2 
millionayear slugger who can wallop a baseball but in spains 
financial world the name refers to someone known for a different 
kind of big bang 
that pedro guerrero is a lawyer securities professional and son 
of a spanish banker last month he was elected chairman of the 
madrid stock exchange at age 36 making him the youngest person to 
head a major securities market 
more importantly guerrero has been presiding over a profound 
reform in spains securities industry thats shattered the 
160yearold shackles of government control a revolution known as 
el big bang 
it officially began july 29 when the state monopoly on 
securities trading ended stock exchanges became private 
businesses governmentappointed stockbrokers were replaced by 
private brokerages after a transition period oncefixed 
commissions will be freely negotiatable 
like the big bang deregulation of the british markets a few 
years ago the spanish securities overhaul is aimed at making stock 
trading more competitive efficient and attractive to foreigners 
seeking opportunities in one of europes fastestgrowing economies 
the changeover has gone very well although weve still got a 
long road to run guerrero said in an interview many people 
especially in the business press did not believe we would be ready 
by the july 29 deadline but we were 
hes not related to the dominicanborn pedro guerrero who bats 
cleanup for the st louis cardinals in the united states but their 
aggressiveness is strikingly similar 
guerreros management of the el big bang changeover at madrids 
stock exchange where 70 percent of spanish stocks are traded has 
overshadowed his conspicuous youth in a profession historically 
dominated by rigid thinking and slowmoving brokers accustomed to 
the life of government bureaucrats 
he talks about selling products and services said jose 
manuel nunezlagos 67 a 38year career stockbroker and president 
of the hispano brokerage this is precisely the difference 
between the old exchange and the new one 
guerrero smokes heavily and wears modest clothes that belie his 
wealth he made a fortune channeling investment funds from foreign 
markets into spain through the asesores bursatiles brokerage which 
he helped found in 1988 asesores accounted for more than 5 
percent of total volume on the madrid exchange 80 percent of that 
from foreign investors 
his youth stands in marked contrast to other world stock 
exchange leaders new york stock exchange chairman john phelan is 
58 for example american stock exchange chairman arthur levitt is 
58 toronto stock exchange chairman charles caty is 48 tokyo stock 
exchange chairman minoru nagaoka is 65 
guerrero attributed his election by the revamped stock 
exchanges 51 members partly to what he called an acrosstheboard 
generational change in spanish society 
he mentioned luis carlos croissier 38 named president of the 
national securities commission the government agency that will 
police the markets under the reform prime minister felipe gonzalez 
is only 47 guerrero noted 
in other places where there has been a long stable history 
and much tradition my election might not have been possible 
guerrero said but im a firm believer in putting younger people 
in important posts 
guerrero said his priorities include revising the cumbersome 
timeconsuming system for finalizing stock trades and developing 
the nations first stockoptions market options widely traded by 
speculators in the united states are rights to buy or sell stocks 
within a set time for a set price 
he also intends to expand computerized trading introduced in 
april using a model of the toronto stock exchanges computer 
automated trading system the spanish cats network links the madrid 
exchange to smaller exchanges in barcelona bilbao and valencia 
guerrero said 22 percent of all trading is now done via cats and 
the figure should double by the end of the year as the historical 
openoutcry system of traders shouting bids gradually is phased out 
his fast rise in spains securities industry reflects guerreros 
own intense drive and ambition he placed first seven years ago in 
the tough state exams for his stockbrokers diploma but he was 
never completely satisfied just peddling stocks and looked for 
other opportunities 
in 1984 he and two friends visited financial institutions in 
london to discuss their preparations for britains market 
deregulation thats where he got the idea for what became an 
immensely successful business in spain 
they all wanted to hear about spanish investment 
possibilities guerrero said they said if there was a firm in 
spain that could provide topquality research and services it 
would get all the clients it could handle and more 
guerrero and friends returned to madrid and formed asesores 
bursatiles in 1985 the firm channeled about 350 million in 
foreign investments into the spanish markets last year they 
handled 38 billion mainly in foreign money and have since 
diversified the firm into other corporate financial services 
asked if he was concerned that spains market deregulation would 
incite rampant greed and fraud guerrero said he believed the 
government could still police the securities industry 
im completely confident that the new national securities 
commission is going to strongly discourage this and be very tough 
on rulebreakers he said 
as an example he mentioned the commissions recent probe of 
drexel burnham lambert incs spanish subsidiary even before any 
formal action was taken drexel shut down the operation july 17 
after determining it had improperly sold securities in a spanish 
oil company

us authorities will have to borrow tens of 
billions of dollars from other countries to help bail out failed 
savings and loans institutions dollars foreigners will someday use 
to compete for scarcer goods in this country an economist 
predicted wednesday 
the bill president bush signed wednesday authorizes borrowing 
50 billion over the next 26 months the total cost of the bailout 
will be far higher because of interest costs 
foreigners already buy future claims on this country at a rate 
of 10 billion a month through their purchases of american bonds 
shares real estate and other property 
americans do not save enough of their own money to pay for the 
things they want from foreigners now so the needed money has to be 
lent to this country from abroad 
unfortunately people in government focus on shortterm 
problems and not on the long term said matthew b canzoneri 
professor of economics at georgetown university 
im a babyboomer in the long run therell be fewer people 
in this country to produce goods to support me in my old age the 
same is true of mr yamaguchi in japan and the japanese 
population is getting older faster than ours is 
canzoneri sees japanese and other foreigners wanting to cash in 
their loans and investments and use the dollars to buy up american 
goods at a time when fewer american goods will be produced in 
proportion to the us population all that money chasing fewer 
goods will run up prices lower living standards and bring 
pressures to cut pensions in this country he predicted 
canzoneri also predicts additional government borrowing will 
cause shortterm problems 
lenders in wall street may get jittery he said that 
would drive up interest rates that will increase the cost of the 
federal governments deficit then there would be pressure on the 
federal reserve system to push interest rates down that would mean 
even more borrowing and the threat of inflation

michael norris is in search of the 
perfectly cooked chicken but his tools are more likely to include 
a slide rule than a spatula 
norris a 26yearold graduate chemical engineering student at 
the university of louisville is trying to create a mathematical 
model for showing how quickly chicken pieces will cook under 
varying conditions 
financed by a 15000 grant from kentucky fried chicken norris 
is attempting to develop the model for his masters thesis at the 
equipment performance lab of the companys col sanders technical 
center 
basically all cooking is a physical phenomenon said dr 
mohan rao a senior research scientist for kentucky fried chicken 
the nations biggest fried chicken chain with norris model we 
should be able to tell exactly what the process should be he 
said 
whenever the company changes its brand of shortening or uses a 
new type of pressure cooker it has to alter the cooking procedure 
the company would use the formula being developed by norris to 
replace trial and error testing methods 
minor improvements in productivity translate into a 
significant amount of money says richard m detwiler a 
spokesman at kentucky fried chicken which sells nearly 6 billion 
worth of chicken and other foods annually 
using an overhead projector norris creates graph outlines of 
drumsticks measured in two positions to arrive at an average 
dimension then with what norris says is best explained as 
fouriers law he uses the measurements to work out an equation 
that will predict how quickly various parts of the chicken will 
cook 
fouriers law states that with two masses the greater the 
temperature difference the faster the heat transfers rao said 
the 40yearold rao spent 15 years as a professor of food 
processing at the university of georgia in athens last month he 
was named an adjunct professor at the university where he will 
teach a class on food processing next spring 
norris said he had no particular interest in working with 
chicken before he was selected for the project however standing 
in a room surrounded by trays of fried chicken norris said he 
might consider a career in foodprocess control

the chicago board of trade will do whatever it 
takes to restore confidence after 46 traders were indicted as a 
result of a sweeping federal probe of trading fraud the exchange 
chairman pledged wednesday 
we do not tolerate a single customer being abused on our 
exchange board chairman karsten mahlmann told the annual meeting 
of the us feed grains council which ended its threeday session 
wednesday 
we want your confidence we will do anything and everything to 
keep it 
mahlmann told council members the board has increased its audit 
and investigation staff by 30 percent and on thursday will 
consider a proposal to increase the penalty for each rule violation 
to 250000 from 75000 
thats how bad they want a clean house he said of the 
tougher policies which followed last weeks indictment of dozens 
of traders at the board of trade and the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
mahlmann also defended the board of trade decision to order the 
sale of some july soybean contracts as a last resort to keep 
the market operating smoothly 
but farmer jack kintzle of coggon iowa said there still are 
too many unanswered questions about the soybean sale which 
primarily affected an italian processor ferruzzi finanziaria spa 
i think the the ferruzzi deal is bothering the farmers in 
gravelroad america even more than the indictments kintzle said 
if they had left the market run wed have had 8 or 9 beans 
farmers might not have sold but at least they would have had the 
opportunity 
the board of trade move was widely interpreted as an effort to 
break up an attempt to corner the market ferruzzi denied that was 
its aim saying it needed the beans for its crushing operation and 
customers 
the action forced ferruzzi to give up nearly all of its july 
contracts for the delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans 
the commodity futures trading commission already had taken steps 
to cancel an exemption that allowed ferruzzi to hold contracts for 
more than the 3 millionbushel limit the federal agency has said 
there were contracts for delivery of about 40 million bushels of 
soybeans and only about 12 million bushels available 
mahlmann said the board of trade preferred to apply its 
liquidation order across the marketplace to everyone with more 
than 3 million bushels whether they were buyers or sellers 
the order required people to liquidate 20 percent of their 
contracts each day and to have contracts for no more than 1 
million bushels of beans on july 20 he said 
the cftc plan would have forced ferruzzi to liquidate contracts 
for 20 million bushels in one day mahlmann said 
that would have had longlasting devastating consequences on 
the soybean complex he said i wouldnt have wanted to 
speculate on where prices would have gone 
but farmer steve wentworth of oreana president of the national 
corn growers association was uneasy about the move 
i have some concerns that it affected the credibility of the 
board of trade and some farmers still have problems with that 
he said 
the us feed grains council a private organization of farm and 
agribusiness groups was formed in 1960 to promote export markets 
for us corn barley and sorghum

the value of florida citrus land is 
rising reflecting a general improvement in the agricultural 
economy and a comeback from winter freezes according to a new 
survey 
the value of mature south florida orange groves was up 82 
percent to 11873 an acre and central florida orange acreage rose 
54 percent to 11800 an acre in the survey period from november 
1988 to may 1989 
the survey released this week by the university of floridas 
institute of food and agricultural sciences demonstrated the 
confidence and optimism in the heart of the florida citrus belt 
hardhit by severe freezes in december 1983 and january 1985 that 
killed nearly 200000 acres of trees 
weve seen prices bottom out and theyre on the way back up 
said john jackson citrus specialist with the lake county 
agricultural extension service 
relatively mild weather has prevailed during the past four 
winters and citrus planting has been active about 125000 acres 
were planted statewide in 1986 and 1987 industry figures show 
the value of an acre of mature grapefruit groves in central 
florida was placed at 10265 an acre a 55 percent jump from 
november 1988 in south florida grapefruit groves were valued at 
10420 an acre a 27 percent increase 
part of the value of the farmland reflects its potential for 
commercial development said the authors of the report university 
of florida agriculture professors john gordon and john reynolds and 
visiting professor jh atkinson 
they said caution must be used in making yeartoyear 
comparisons from prior surveys

corn futures were lower but soybeans and wheat 
prices mostly higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade 
corn was under pressure at the opening bell because of the 
unusually high crop production estimate released after the close of 
business tuesday by influential private forecaster conrad leslie 
although leslies forecast for soybeans was bearish as well 
most traders apparently felt that was discounted during the late 
wave of selling at tuesdays close 
wheat got its support from a small but steady stream of export 
business including rumors of a possible buy perhaps as much as 
600000 tons by taiwan also supporting prices in the pit was the 
hot dry weather in growing areas of the united states europe and 
the soviet union 
trading remained in a narrow range and is expected to do so 
again thursday as traders square their positions in anticipation of 
the us department of agriculture report on actual crop production 
on the close wheat was cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 394 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents lower with september at 222 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents lower to cent higher with september at 136 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents lower to 5 cents higher with august

cocacola co said wednesday it has completed the 
acquisition of a bottling and distribution subsidiary of frances 
pernodricard group putting an end to a dispute that has soured 
relations between the two beverage companies for almost two years 
cocacola said it has agreed to pay the equivalent of about 140 
million for societe parisienne de boissons gazeuses spbg and its 
subsidiaries which have bottled and distributed soft drinks in 
france under license from cocacola for the past 40 years 
pernodricard put the price higher at about 155 million a 
spokesman said the difference reflected a payment covering items 
such as current contracts and goodwill 
cocacolas decision to take over its bottling and distribution 
activities in france is part of a broader strategy of boosting 
consumption of its products worldwide 
the conflict between pernodricard and cocacola arose when the 
atlantabased company said it wanted to take over the french 
operations claiming that pernodricard was not trying hard enough 
to market cocacola products in france 
pernodricard accused coca cola of breach of contract and took 
the matter to court 
spbgs sales of cocacola products last year totalled roughly 
220 million or 42 percent of pernodricards softdrinks business 
last year 
cyriac de salaberry a spokesman for cocacola in paris said 
the bulk of the purchase price reflects realestate assets mainly 
bottling plants and storage depots 
apart from cocacola spbg bottles and distributes cocacola 
soft drinks under the brand names sprite fanta and finley by 
acquiring spbg cocacola now has control of more than 90 percent 
of its products sold in france

brimming storage tanks of gasoline that should 
be almost empty are teaching oil companies an old economics lesson 
this summer when prices rise consumers buy less 
the cost of gasoline which soared 20 cents or more this spring 
in the aftermath of the exxon valdez oil spill and widespread 
predictions of shortages has been stabilizing and even dropping in 
some places because of a surprising oversupply at the height of the 
driving season 
major oil companies expected people were more indifferent to 
prices than they actually turned out to be says william veno 
director of oil market analysis for data resources inc an 
economic research concern they wouldnt have wanted to raise 
prices so much as to undermine demand and theyve tended to do 
that 
not only are motorists making fewer trips to the filling 
station theyre also buying cheaper grades of gasoline industry 
statistics suggest the result is that instead of shortages there 
are surpluses especially of highpriced highoctane premium 
that doesnt mean demand couldnt pick up theres still a good 
months worth of summer vacation season left more gasoline 
consumption could alter the supplydemand equation and prices could 
start rising 
but as of late last month the average retail price for all 
types of gasoline had dropped to 113 a gallon from a peak 118 a 
gallon on may 19 according to statistics from the lundberg survey 
inc a research group that tracks gasoline prices nationwide 
the bureau of labor statistics in washington which monitors the 
inflation rate estimates the average price per gallon for all 
grades of motor fuel soared from 944 cents in january to 115 in 
june a 22 percent gain 
high octane which averaged about 109 in january rose 19 
cents to 128 a gallon in june unleaded regular the most widely 
consumed grade rose from about 92 cents a gallon to 111 
when prices of gasoline went up people bought less but more 
important they started buying cheaper grades says dennis eklof 
an energy specialist with the consulting group cambridge energy 
research associates when the customer switches and downgrades it 
increases the overall supply in total 
petroleum intelligence weekly an industry trade publication 
reported recently that premium unleaded sales have fallen at least 
10 percent because of motorists switching to regular unleaded 
wholesale prices are down even more sharply than retail in some 
cases below levels last seen two years ago that could translate 
into even lower retail prices in coming months 
the new york price of wholesale regular unleaded for example 
fell from 78 cents a gallon in late april to about 51 cents a 
gallon earlier this month 
overestimates of summer driving and concern about supply 
disruptions caused by the exxon oil spill led refiners to make too 
much gasoline analysts say what happened is that people altered 
their plans says brent crosby executive director of the service 
station dealers of arizona so the big usage didnt materialize 
and now we have a glut of refined product on the market if the 
price falls that much it has to be a tremendous oversupply 
predictions of shortages arose from a number of other causes 
tougher federal antipollution regulations for example require 
refineries to use more crude in making gasoline refinery 
accidents maintenance delays and lower production from britains 
north sea fields also played a role 
but the biggest shot to the market psyche was the exxon oil 
spill 
the march 24 disaster in alaska jolted the market because the 
cleanup temporarily disrupted the flow of crude to west coast 
refiners raising the possibility of shortages refiners responded 
by reducing sales to customers 
almost overnight prices rocketed with wholesale premium 
gasoline up 30 cents in some parts of the country in los angeles 
for example regular unleaded surged to 107 on april 5 from 74 
cents the day of the spill the price shock quickly rippled through 
the country 
in the end shipments from alaska were disrupted for days 
instead of weeks about 13 million barrels of southbound crude was 
delayed in addition to the 250000 barrels lost from the leaking 
exxon tanker 
moreover refinery repairs and accidents had not caused other 
delays anticipated earlier refinery capacity turned out to be 
greater than expected and refiners were better prepared to handle 
the new antipollution requirements 
after the spill crude oil prices stabilized in the 
1920abarrel range until last month when they slid to about 
18 in response to the softening gasoline market and a surge in 
summer production by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
refiners are just starting to slow production while the surplus 
dwindles but that means crude oil stockpiles are growing 
its a doubleedged sword if refiners dont cut back theres 
too much product if they do then there is too much crude says 
james r fiedler energy analyst at edampf man international 
futures inc 
whether latesummer vacationers will reduce the oversupply of 
gasoline remains unclear the american automobile association 
which tracks summer driving had predicted a 4 percent increase 
this year over last but now says that growth is unlikely 
it is fair to say that gasoline prices have had an impact on 
gasoline consumption and driving habits as well says jerry 
cheske spokesman for aaa whether people cancelled vacations i 
dont think so theyre just more conservative in their driving 
habits 
some analysts believe consumers have sent a clear message to oil 
companies 
the lesson oil companies are learning is that you cant go and 
raise prices by 20 percent and not expect something to happen 
veno says its a big lesson

lottery giant gtech corp announced 
wednesday it has agreed to a 290 million buyout by about a dozen 
members of management and a unit of the investment firm donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
the price tag includes roughly 160 million for gtechs stock 
and 130 million for payment of fees refinancing of gtechs debts 
and a contribution to working capital 
the top managers including guy b snowden the chairman and 
chief executive and victor markowicz gtechs vice chairman will 
retain their positions in the company snowden said 
the purchase price was 1662 per share in cash gtech stock 
rose 75 cents a share to 16 in overthecounter trading on 
wednesday the price had been inflated before the announcement by 
speculation of a possible acquisition 
the company has nearly 10 million shares outstanding 
gtech a leading supplier worldwide of online computerized 
lottery networks currently serves 35 customers in the united 
states and elsewhere including ireland new zealand mexico 
spain venezuela iceland australia sweden singapore and canada 
if the recently approved sports betting in oregon spreads to 
other states gtech would be a major beneficiary from this 
spread since the sports betting would use the same machines as 
the existing lotteries said william ritger an analyst with 
dillon read amp co inc 
gtech is going to continue on in the lottery business as is 
snowden said in a telephone interview wednesday we are a leader 
in the business and we aim to stay a leader 
the merger was approved by the gtech board on tuesday but 
requires approval from gtech shareholders at a meeting later this 
year snowden said the meeting would be held in the fall but he 
would not say precisely when 
the company noted that the agreement depends on completion of 
financing and on certain government approval and assurances from 
some lottery authorities to continue gtechs contracts 
rumors of a possible gtech takeover surfaced last october 
prompting snowden to issue a statement saying the company had an 
opendoor policy and would consider offers 
in early may gtech acknowledged that certain parties had 
expressed an interest in acquiring the company also in may the 
company announced the establishment of a special committee to 
evaluate possible business combinations the committee consisted of 
directors and financial advisors from bear stearns amp co inc and 
alex brown amp sons inc 
snowden declined wednesday to talk about the outside interest 
other than saying we were talking to a lot of people about a lot 
of things 
snowden said last year he felt an unfriendly takeover was 
unlikely since any disruption of the companys top management team 
would wreck most of its contracts in both logistical and legal 
terms

corn futures were lower but soybeans and wheat prices finished 
higher wednesday as traders hewed to narrow ranges in advance of a 
muchanticipated us department of agriculture survey of crop 
production for the year 
on other markets sugar futures surged on rumors that india was 
in the market for as many as 300000 tons heating oil led a modest 
runup in the petroleum futures complex and frozen pork belly 
prices continued sliding in the face of historically high 
inventories 
corn came under pressure with the opening bell at the chicago 
board of trade because of the unusually high crop production 
estimate 772 billion bushels released after the close of 
trading tuesday by influential private forecaster conrad leslie 
although leslies forecast for soybeans was high as well 195 
billion bushels most traders apparently felt that was discounted 
during the late wave of selling tuesday that dragged november 
soybeans to yet another contract low 
traders tested the contract low at 562 again early wednesday 
after support held above that mark many traders squared up their 
positions and headed to the sidelines to await thursdays 
government report 
the confusion between leslies numbers and what the traders 
were looking for pulled the market the past two days said jerry 
gidel research director for lit america inc chicago i think 
people were happy just to even up and wait and see what the 
official numbers look like 
wheat settled 1 cents to 5 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in september at 395 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents 
lower with september at 223 a bushel oats were 1 cents lower 
to unchanged with september at 136 a bushel soybeans were 1 
cents to 9 cents higher with august at 594 a bushel 
rumors of a big purchase by india which some traders speculated 
may already have taken place pushed sugar futures prices above 14 
cents a pound at midsession 
that number has psychological value and it got some people 
excited enough to jump on the bandwagon said arthur stevenson of 
prudentialbache securities inc new york sugar supplies have 
been tight for a while and a report of somebody coming in and 
taking that much out of the market was bound to spur a rally 
late profittaking helped trim the gains however and sugar 
finished 05 cent to 26 cent higher on the new york coffee sugar 
and cocoa exchange with october at 1407 cents 
an american petroleum institute report released after tuesdays 
trading showed a substantial drawdown in heating oil supplies last 
month and that lifted the entire complex 
crude oil was 9 cents to 14 cents higher at the new york 
mercantile exchange with september at 1821 a barrel heating oil 
was 66 cent to 96 cent higher with september at 4943 cents a 
gallon and unleaded gasoline was 14 cent to 40 cent higher with 
september at 5058 cents a gallon 
livestock futures were mostly lower while pork futures were 
sharply lower at the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 35 cent lower to 27 cent higher with august 
at 7457 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 33 
cent higher with august at 8490 cents a pound live hogs were 33 
cent to 123 cents lower with august at 4677 cents a pound and 
frozen pork bellies were 30 cent to 113 cents higher with august 
at 2492 cents a pound 
precious metals were mixed 
gold prices climbed 10 cents to 70 cents on the comex with 
august at 36690 a troy ounce silver slipped 1 cent to 3 cents

the price of paramount communications inc stock 
rose in active trading wednesday on speculation that the company 
that launched an unsuccessful 122 billion bid for time inc was 
itself a takeover target 
paramount rose 250 to 6212 a share and was the second most 
actively traded issue on the new york stock exchange as more than 
41 million of its shares changed hands paramount stock rose 
262 a share on tuesday 
paramount the onetime conglomerate that has been selling 
assets outside its entertainment and publishing businesses under 
chairman martin davis said it does not comment on market 
activity rumors or speculation 
jeffrey logdson who follows paramount for the investment firm 
crowell weedon amp co in los angeles said the activity in 
paramounts stock reflected the swirl of rumors about possible 
suitors for the company 
among those mentioned have been chriscraft industries inc a 
media concern that is a major shareholder in warner communications 
inc and an investor group led by charles dolan head of 
cablevision systems corp a long island nybased cable 
television company 
columnist dan dorfman said in wednesdays edition of usa today 
that a group of investors led by dolan had acquired a stake in 
paramount and may seek control 
dolan was said to be out of the country and unavailable for 
comment cablevision spokesman david carey said it is our policy 
neither to confirm nor deny any speculation about a possible 
acquisition 
two calls placed to chriscraft were not returned 
paramount recently tried but failed with an eleventhhour 
hostile bid for time which had earlier agreed to a merger with 
warner 
paramount offered 107 billion for time and later raised its 
offer to 122 billion but time deflected the bid by insisting it 
was not for sale and amending its stockswap merger with warner 
into a 14 billion warner buyout 
paramount failed to win a fight in the delaware state courts to 
block the timewarner merger and dropped its bid july 24 
late last month paramount said it had agreed to sell its 
consumer and commercial finance unit the associates corp for 
335 billion to ford motor co 
but some analysts said the sale of the unit that accounted for 
46 percent of paramounts operating income in 1988 coupled with an 
expected infusion of cash could make paramount more attractive to 
bidders

oil futures prices rose wednesday on news that 
refineries pumped less gasoline last week 
west texas intermediate for september delivery rose 9 cents on 
the new york mercantile exchange and finished at 1821 a barrel 
wti sets the standard in the us industry for light sweet crude 
oil 
contracts for later delivery of wti posted slightly higher gains 
domestic heating oil traded on the exchange showed the biggest 
gains the contract for september rose 087 cent to 4943 cents a 
gallon while october rose 092 cent to 5016 cents 
september unleaded gasoline finished 014 cent higher at 5058 
cents a gallon while other contracts also advanced 
statistics from the american petroleum institute showed that 
crude oil runs at refineries fell by 500000 barrels last week 
while distillate or heating oil runs declined by 100000 barrels 
the figures suggest that refineries which have operated at the 
highest levels in a decade slowed their output of gasoline and 
heating oil 
energy analysts said that those statistics helped offset what 
could have been a negative impact from the same api report which 
showed that supplies of crude oil gasoline and heating oil in 
storage all rose during the same week ended aug 4 
gasoline prices have softened in recent weeks as supply exceeded 
demand and inventories increased 
crude prices also have weakened recently due to the surge in 
summer output by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
and sluggish demand 
analysts said the new api data might lead investors to believe 
that market fundamentals are improving 
its too early to say if this is the beginning of a sustained 
rally said andrew lebow senior broker for edampf man 
international futures inc it could be that traders will be 
looking ahead to heating oil season

bally manufacturing corp can 
begin a 350 million debt refinancing to be paid for largely 
through its park place casino in atlantic city state regulators 
ruled wednesday 
the casino control commission rejected arguments from state 
gaming officials that the refinancing would put park place one of 
atlantic citys leading gaming halls on shaky financial footing 
i find that this is a responsible proposal which will not 
jeopardize park places financial stability or its ability to 
maintain a firstclass facility commission chairman walter n 
read said 
bally manufacturing the casinos chicagobased parent company 
wants to make park place more independent the refinancing plan 
includes offering 350 million in mortgage notes to fund a 150 
million dividend payment to bally and retire existing corporate 
debt 
the casino would incur the 350 million debt about 120 million 
would be used by the parent firm to retire debt unrelated to 
atlantic city ventures 
read admitted the proposal would increase park places debt 
without an equal benefit to the casino 
but he said he is satisfied that the proposed transaction is 
responsible and is not a plan to siphon funds from a healthy 
facility and leave it in a weakened state nor does it mark the 
beginning of a withdrawal by bally from the new jersey gaming 
market 
read said bally has invested more than 600 million in park 
place while receiving just 43 million in dividends and plans to 
spend 213 million more on capital improvements 
dissenting commissioner w david waters and state division of 
gaming enforcement officials argued that the casino will have 
problems paying off the debt despite promises by bally officials 
waters said the plan merely reshuffles financing to bally 
manufacturing 
it in no way benefits the park place he said the 
facility is basically selffinancing its future ability to be 
selffinancing is inhibited 
bally attorney clive cummis said the restructuring plan would 
begin soon but he was not more specific

finance minister mailson da nobrega said 
wednesday the nations foreign creditors have agreed to a delay in 
debt payments and he denied brazil will enter a moratorium 
da nobrega told the congressional finance commission that the 
government wanted to avoid a confrontation with creditors and 
wished to negotiate lateness until the countrys foreign 
reserves reached a respectable level 
in july the government restricted the outflow of dollars by 
channeling all foreign exchange operations through the central 
bank equivalent to the us federal reserve 
since then brazils cash reserves have risen nearly 1 billion 
to 65 billion surpassing the minimum level considered safe by 
the government which is 6 billion equivalent to four months of 
imports 
but the government continues to hold back about 1 billion in 
debt payments since june 30 including 400 million to western 
government leaders due july 3 and some 600 million in interest 
payments and dividend remittances by foreign multinationals da 
nobrega said 
that falls short of a moratorium which would be a total halt to 
payments on foreign debt 
da nobrega said the government needed the reserves to avoid 
shocks from abroad and insure a smooth transition of government 
during the coming months 
on nov 15 brazilians will elect president jose sarneys 
successor in the nations first peoples vote in 29 years the 
winner will take office on mar 15 1990 
brazil tottering under a 112 billion foreign debt the third 
worlds largest is also seeking fresh money to meet an interest 
payment of 3 billion due in september to private foreign banks

president bush saying im proud to sign 
this monster wednesday put his signature on a 159 billion 
rescue package for the savingsandloan industry 
with the ink barely dry on the 371page rewrite of federal 
banking laws his administration began putting the plan into 
effect approving the first 815 million installment for cleaning 
up the nations most heavily indebted savings and loans 
hours after the signing the resolution trust corp the new 
federal agency created to dispose of ailing thrifts said it was 
considering unilaterally reducing high interest rates on longterm 
certificates issued by some of 262 insolvent but still open thrift 
institutions 
the bill is not perfect but it is a first step a crucial 
first step toward restoring public confidence bush said at a 
rose garden billsigning ceremony attended by the chief architects 
of the legislation 
bush said the overhaul the governments biggestever industry 
bailout will help ensure that not one dollar of insured funds 
will be lost by any depositor 
the legislation a lightly modified version of the rescue plan 
bush first submitted to congress feb 6 authorizes 50 billion in 
new government borrowing over the next 26 months to clean up ailing 
sampls in part by buying up highrate certificates of deposit issued 
by the shaky thrifts to attract capital 
the measure requires sampl owners within four months to have 
150 in tangible capital for every 100 in lending as a cushion 
between future losses and government insurance funds by 1995 the 
standard will tighten to 3 for each 100 in loans 
the overhaul also toughens criminal penalties for fraud and 
triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the banking regulation in 50 
years 
this includes a dismantling of the primary sampl regulatory 
agency the federal home loan bank board under the overhaul 
federal deposit insurance for sampls will be provided by a new 
insurance fund called the savings association insurance funds 
saif pronounced safe 
shortly after bush signed the bill treasury secretary nicholas 
brady convened a meeting of the resolution trust corp oversight 
board set up by the legislation to sell off sour loans and 
repossessed real estate the government is inheriting from the 
failed thrifts 
the board voted to spend 815 million as the first installment 
in shutting down or merging sampls with the highest negative net 
worths including 215 million for dealing with three yet to be 
identified insititutions on thursday 
the government which has already closed 223 sampls is authorized 
under the legislation to shut down up to 500 more of the nations 
nearly 3000 institutions over three years it is required to spend 
20 billion over the next seven weeks alone on the problem 
of that 20 billion 15 billion will be used to replace 
deposits lost to institutions as highrate certificates most with 
30 60 and 90day terms and some paying up to 11 percent 
interest come due 
the resolution trust corp said those certificates could be 
renewed but at interest rates up to 3 percentage points under what 
they are now earning and expects some of the certificate money to 
be withdrawn 
unresolved is whether the corporation will continue to honor the 
high interest rates on longerterm certificates as the bank board 
had 
at issue are longterm certificates issued by 262 institutions 
the federal government has already taken over but has not had the 
money to redeem those institutions highrate certificates total 
50 billion but only a small portion of them are longterm 
according to analysts 
the resolution corporation is expected to decide within the next 
few days how to honor the certificates 
latest administration estimates put the total cost of the 
bailout at 159 billion through 1999 
bush said the measure which received final congressional 
approval saturday says to tens of millions of savings and loan 
depositors you will not be the victims of others mistakes 
in a reference to the nearly footthick financial institutions 
reform recovery and enforcement act of 1989 resting on a table 
awaiting his signature bush said thank you all very much and 
now im proud to sign this monster 
among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were treasury 
secretary brady housing and urban development secretary jack kemp 
and key capitol hill backers of the legislation including sen 
donald w riegle jr dmich and rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
chairmen of the congressional banking committees 
riegle later told reporters the bill deals with every major 
problem we were able to identify he praised the administration 
for moving to put the plan into effect so quickly 
some analysts expect that government buyouts and mergers with 
commercial banks will leave only 1000 or so savings and loans 
still in business at the end of five years 
bush said that the legislation comes to grips with the 
problems facing our savings and loan industry it will safeguard 
and stabilize americas financial system and put in place permanent 
reforms so these problems will never happen again 
the bill includes punishments for fraud committed by officers 
and directors of financial institutions of up to 1 million a day 
in fines and 20 years in prison 
those who try and loot the savings of their fellow citizens 
deserve and will receive swift and severe punishment bush said

slashing the federal budget deficit would 
dramatically improve the nations 129 billion annual trade 
imbalance congressional fiscal experts said wednesday 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office said that by 
meeting the deficit targets mandated by the grammrudman law 
which requires a balanced federal budget by 1993 the countrys 
trade shortfall could be cut by 40 billion to 65 billion 
many economists agree that reducing federal red ink would help 
the trade imbalance but by producing its 77page report which 
relies on simulations to make its arguments cbo provided more 
ammunition to members of congress pressing for a fiscal 1991 budget 
deal with the white house that would entail major deficit cuts 
the congressional agency estimated that eventually every 1 
billion cut in the federal deficit would improve the nations trade 
picture by 300 million to 500 million 
the cbo also said that expanding the money supply would have 
little effect on the us trade deficit since exchange rates are 
flexible 
among the options policymakers have for reducing the us 
current account deficit reducing the federal budget deficit is 
the most promising the cbo said 
the current account deficit is the broadest measure of the trade 
deficit registering not only products but services as well the 
us current account deficit reached 132 billion last year and is 
expected to be about 129 billion this year at the beginning of 
this decade the united states had a slight surplus in trade 
to pay for the extra goods and services entering this country 
the united states must borrow money from abroad 
in the long run this borrowing will transfer wealth abroad 
and this will reduce living standards of americans in the future 
cbo director robert d reischauer said at a news conference 
economists disagree over how threatening the trade imbalance is 
some say it bodes ill because it could trigger protectionist 
legislation and recession while others argue it means little 
but they mostly agree that cutting the federal deficit would 
ease the trade shortfall by lowering the need to borrow from 
abroad reducing interest rates allowing the dollar to decline and 
thus making american products more attractive to foreign buyers 
the budget deficit for fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 is 
expected to be about 148 billion the grammrudman laws deficit 
ceiling for next year is 100 billion and congress will resume its 
efforts to reach that target when it returns from its summer recess 
in september 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said the 
cbo conclusions emphasize the urgency of agreeing upon a bold 
deficit reduction package for fiscal year 1991 as soon as 
possible

a federal appeals court wednesday set aside 
a decision clearing corporate raider t boone pickens investment 
group of violating securities and racketeering laws in a takeover 
bid for phillips petroleum co five years ago 
a threejudge panel of the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
vacated a lower courts summary judgment in favor of pickens mesa 
partnership and sent the case back to us district court in 
delaware 
the lawsuits brought by phillips shareholders accused mesa of 
deception in its 91 billion attempt to take over the 
bartelsville okla oil giant 
william wade an attorney for mesa said from wilmington del 
that he had not seen the decision and would not comment 
the court ruled a jury could reasonably conclude that mesa 
which made 89 million on the takeover attempt had always intended 
to sell its phillips stock back to the company for a better deal 
than the other stockholders received such a tactic is known as 
greenmail 
during the takeover attempt pickens repeatedly said mesa would 
not consider selling back its shares unless the same deal was 
offered to all stockholders 
the partnership changed its stance when phillips adopted a 
poison pill strategy to fight the takeover 
the appeals court said the district court incorrectly cited a 
lack of evidence 
although much of the evidence was circumstantial circuit judge 
anthony j scirica wrote no other type normally is available in 
badfaith cases 
a jury could reasonably conclude that the partnership either 
was reckless in making the equalbasis statements given the 
forseeability of what actually occurred or that the partnership 
intended from the outset of its tender offer to sell back to 
phillips on an unequal basis scirica wrote 
the appeals panel upheld the summary judgment involving all 
delaware state charges
