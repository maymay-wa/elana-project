six sailors were killed and five injured 
tuesday when an intense fire erupted in the engine room of a navy 
supply ship heading home from a deployment supporting persian gulf 
operations the pentagon said 
crewmen aboard the uss white plains a food stores ship battled 
the blaze for over an hour before bringing it under control 
officials said the ship was in the south china sea about 100 miles 
east of hong kong at the time 
the pentagon spokesman dan howard said that the fire occurred 
in the main engine spaces a navy source said it apparently 
involved a fuel leak in and around the ships no 3 boiler 
the 581foot white plains is based at the pacific island of guam 
and is crewed by a normal complement of 403 enlisted men and 25 
officers 
anxious relatives of crew members gathered at the military 
chapel on guam tuesday awaiting word on the accident some wives 
had just returned to guam after visiting their husbands during a 
port call in hong kong 
the accident occurred three weeks after an explosion inside a 
gun turret on the battleship iowa left 47 sailors dead 
questions have been raised about whether the iowa explosion was 
due to faulty powder or human error but officials have not yet 
said what caused the accident howard with a curt oneword reply 
of none dismissed the idea the fire aboard the white plains 
might suggest problems with navy training or equipment maintenance 
in addition to the six dead five other crewmen were injured by 
late tuesday the navy had identified three of those killed and 
four of the injured 
the first four fatalities were identified as boiler technician 
3rd class muoi cao 22 of ventura calif fireman apprentice todd 
allan follis 22 of zuni nm machinist matefireman apprentice 
paul dennis novotny 22 of howells neb and fireman apprentice 
darryl d edwards 20 flossmor ill 
cao joined the navy in september 1985 and had been aboard the 
white plains since august 1986 follis joined the navy in october 
1987 and had been aboard the ship since july 1988 novotny joined 
the navy in november 1987 and had been on the ship since november 
1988 
the navy identified four of the injured as damage controlman 2nd 
class james henry britt 24 of nashville tenn machinist mate

boatswains mate 2nd class darryl jerome williams 24 of 
birmingham ala and chief boiler technician walter rufus greggs 
jr 41 of mobile ala 
howard and navy spokesmen said the five injured suffered 
primarily secondand thirddegree burns and were airlifted to the 
military hospital at clark air base in the philippines a 
spokeswoman there air force capt donna eggleston said they were 
listed in stable condition 
after the fire was extinguished the whte plains was taken under 
tow to subic bay naval base in the philippines for repairs a navy 
source said the ship wasnt expected to arrive at subic until 
sunday 
the pentagon said it took 75 minutes to control and extinguish 
the blaze military sources who demanded anonymity said the fire 
grew so hot that sailors were limited to fiveminute stints in 
fighting the blaze 
howard said the fire erupted around 2 am edt or 2 pm local 
time the white plains and four other navy ships were steaming 
almost due east of hong kong after completing their port call 
monday and were about 100 miles from land at the time of the fire 
according to one source the fire occurred while the ship was 
steaming at about 21 degrees 58 minutes north latitude and 115 
degrees 37 minutes east longitude 
the four other ships included the aircraft carrier 
constellation the cruiser fox the frigate ouellet and the oiler 
sacramento the constellation battle group was steaming for home 
after duty in the northern arabian sea supporting the naval task 
force in the persian gulf 
the bodies of the sailors killed in the fire were transferred to 
the constellation tuesday the pentagon said adding a 
determination has not been made at this time as to the transfer of 
the remains 
a navy official who asked not to be identified said preliminary 
information suggested the fire involved a fuel leak in the boiler 
manifold intake on the no 3 boiler 
the source said it was unclear at this point whether the failure 
involved human error or an equipment failure although 20 years 
old navy records do not indicate any past serious problems aboard 
the white plains 
according to the navy the white plains is 581 feet long 79 
feet wide and displaces about 16000 tons when fully loaded 
the ship is said to be capable of steaming at 20 knots and is 
powered by three boilers which drive steam turbines the power 
plant which turns a single propeller is said to be capable of 
developing 22000 shaft horsepower 
the ship was constructed by the national steel and shipbuilding 
co of san diego calif and commissioned into active service on 
nov 23 1968

what was hollywoods longest screen kiss where 
did bette davis get her first name what movies star was dead 
before shooting began 
the truly knowledgeable will know the answers 
three minutes 5 seconds between regis toomey and jane wyman 
ronald reagans first wife in the 1940 film youre in the army 
now 
la cousine bette by honore de balzac 
the trail of the pink panther which included unused takes 
from the late peter sellers appearances in previous pink panther 
movies 
the less informed can turn to movie clips a compilation of 
trivia published last month by guinness books and due out in new 
york in november from sterling publishing 
its author patrick robertson says he has been a fan of the 
silver screen since 1943 when at age 3 he saw his first film 
for me and my gal with judy garland 
he cant remember phone numbers or his car registration but his 
memory for movies is pretty encyclopedic he says a civil 
servant in the government bonds division of the department for 
national savings he has been writing about movies since 1974 
his latest work revises his 1985 guinness book of almost 
everything you never needed to know about the movies 
robertsons entries include the likes of what they did 
before a compilation of stars erstwhile careers charles 
bronson was a pennsylvania coal miner and who married whom a 
rundown of interstellar marriages with 74 percent ending in 
divorce 
he relies on two major sources the information department of 
the british film institute in london and the 24volume compendium 
of reviews from 19071984 published by variety the entertainment 
industry newspaper 
thus he informs readers that rex harrison has a glass eye 
sophia loren wrote a cookbook titled in the kitchen with love 
texas name has appeared in 104 movie titles and dustin hoffman 
aged the most in a single film from 17 to 121 in little big 
man 
the book lists actors who have written books served prison 
sentences never married married famous nonactors played 
themselves played god it lists those who faked their birthdates 
played the same role twice and played in films shot entirely 
aboard trains 
under the heading the only film seen by less people than 
appeared in it robertson lists kohlberg a nazi epic 
released in january 1945 when few berlin cinemas were operating 
the cast of 187000 included whole army divisions diverted from 
battle to be extras 
robertson said he was particularly proud of his entry unusual 
casts which enumerates those feature films with a difference 
two for example with a cast made up entirely of maoris a people 
native to new zealand 
under blunders he lists tv antennas in the wrong box 
set in victorian london an electricity pole in gone with the 
wind a 50star american flag in a scene from the godfather 
set in 1945 hawaii became the 50th state in 1959 
robertson says he already has a candidate for that section of 
his next edition in the accused he said jodie foster is 
shown in white shoes as she flees rapists but when the scene is 
shown in flashback her shoes are black

one day last month dr 
habis wahadi and other emergency room staff at the ahli arab 
hospital said they treated 35 palestinians for gunshot wounds from 
confrontations with israeli troops in the gaza strip 
but when wahadi turned on his tv that night israeli news 
reports quoted the army as saying only 20 people were wounded in 
clashes both in gaza and the occupied west bank 
it obviously doesnt compute wahadi said looking at the 
hospitals log book and the difference seems to be getting 
bigger every day 
the army blames some of the discrepancy on difficulties in 
gathering data especially on days when casualties occur in 
farflung rural villages 
but military officials also allege that arabrun hospitals and 
human rights groups have begun exaggerating figures to try to 
retain world interest as the uprising begins its 18th month 
the reason you now see a greater number of wounded is because 
of a deliberate attempt by palestinians to overload the list 
said col raanan gissin the armys deputy spokesman 
he denied there has been a major increase in casualties and 
added they have found it is easier to keep their issue alive by 
providing large numbers of wounded especially in light of 
political moves in the united states regarding the plo 
the latest example of a wide discrepancy in figures came 
saturday when un officials reported 158 people wounded by army 
gunfire in widespread clashes in the gaza strip as well as three 
deaths the army said 77 were wounded and two killed 
the un relief and works agency which supervises aid for 
palestinian refugees said casualties reached a record 405 gaza 
residents wounded by israeli gunfire in april 11 of whom died the 
previous monthly high was 248 in january 
in contrast the armys statistics for april available only for 
the first 27 days show just 198 gazans wounded 
i wont deny that there is some misreporting said a un 
medical officer who asked not to be identified 
he recounted the case of a palestinian woman who first told 
doctors she was beaten by army soldiers then tearfully confessed 
her husband had battered her 
such cases are rare the un doctor said in cases of 
gunshot wounds were almost 100 percent sure about cause and 
effect because we know what kind of ammunition the army has 
rubber bullets plastic bullets m16 rounds 
on one issue there is no disagreement many of the wounded 
palestinians are giving false names to the hospitals 
one gaza youth who admitted falsifying his name when he sought 
treatment for a bullet in the leg said he feared arrest look 
if i give my real name theyll report it to the army he said on 
condition of anonymity the army will come looking for me because 
they figure if ive been shot i was throwing stones i dont 
intend to go to jail 
the false reporting of names prompted the armys regional 
commander maj gen yitzhak mordechai to suggest arab doctors 
were padding hospital records with names drawn at random from 
telephone books 
it just isnt true wahadi said a gunshot wound is a 
gunshot wound whether the boy gives his name as mohammed or 
khaled 
a colleague who asked not to be identified said fear of arrest 
actually led to underreporting of palestinian casualties we 
know of some shebab youths who go quietly to local doctors rather 
than risk registering at hospitals he said 
one incentive for palestinians to say they are wounded is that 
the plo pays compensation for uprising victims 
arab sources said that payments of up to 500 were deposited in 
jordan bank accounts for those who could prove uprising injuries 
the families of people killed by army gunfire collect about double 
that amount the sources said 
still the biggest statistical problems stem from disagreement 
over whom to count in fatality tolls and what constitutes a wounded 
person 
the army counts only deaths it can confirm were caused by 
military gunfire beatings or other actions its total through 
april 27 was 352 palestinians killed 
but the jerusalembased israeli information center for human 
rights in the occupied territories counts 423 palestinians dead 
through april 
the group set up by liberal israelis to monitor the uprising 
includes death reports from hospitals the army says it cannot 
confirm because bodies were taken for burial before autopsy it 
also includes 18 killings blamed on israeli civilians but like the 
army excludes arab assassinations of palestinians suspected of 
collaborating with israel 
the associated press count was 456 at the end of april 
including 42 collaborators and the deaths caused by israeli 
settlers 
the disparity in injury tallies is even greater 
the army counts those palestinians who require hospitalization 
as a result of army action 
according to the armys latest statistics 5667 palestinians 
were wounded in the past 17 months 
the un agency uses a broader definition that includes all 
people who seek medical treatment including outpatient care for 
teargas inhalation or first aid for bruises from beatings or 
rubber bullets 
according to un figures nearly 25000 palestinians were 
injured through april 15 the total includes 4582 wounded by 
gunfire

at midnight the priest lighted a sacred 
fire and called for the bride and groom 
the bride was nursing at her mothers breast the blearyeyed 
groom burdened with a huge turban a sword and marigold garlands 
was yawning 
sonu the 2yearold bride and arjun the 8yearold groom 
were among an estimated 40000 to 50000 children who were married 
across indias rajasthan state during the weekend in violation of a 
law banning child marriage 
the marriages are held on the first and second days of the full 
moon cycle in the month of may when village elders in keeping with 
a centuriesold tradition study the stars and predict rain the 
source of life in a state where 80 percent of the land is desert 
these auspicious days also are celebrated as a weekend harvest 
festival for the years first maize and lentil crops 
such weddings normally are kept secret from outsiders lest the 
parents be prosecuted for marrying their children so young if 
convicted an offender can be jailed for three months fined about 
330 or both 
but there is no record of a single conviction in rajasthan 
which lies between new delhi and bombay local journalists and 
naryan lal tak a tourist guide who is writing a book on rajasthan 
weddings said they knew of only two cases in which complaints were 
filed but no one was charged 
i have nothing to fear i am just following what my 
forefathers did said sonus father narayan prajapati his four 
other children none older than 14 also are married 
i was married when i was just six years old and my wife only 
one year old said prajapati 
for me it is but natural that my children should get married 
according to our tradition said prajapati who earns 4 a day 
working as a carpenter in vorawas 19 miles east of the ancient 
city of jodhpur where indias famed rajput or warrior clan 
thwarted the might of 16th century mogul invaders 
a 1978 indian law set the legal marriage age at 18 for women and 
21 for men but enforcement has been limited especially in 
rajasthan where hindu traditions are deeply rooted many of the 
child marriages take place in areas where there are few law 
enforcement officers and where disruption of custom could trigger 
violence 
in and around vorawas 17 other marriages were conducted in 
recent days none of the brides was older than 14 
i am getting four of my daughters married said udham singh 
the head of the neighboring village of gujrabas 
the youngest of his four daughters was 3yearold jamuna who 
was playing hopscotch with older children in the courtyard of the 
familys mudplastered house 
if you travel through rajasthan today you will find child 
marriages being held everywhere said tak the tourist guide 
by conservative estimate at least 40000 to 50000 marriages 
are solemnized in the state during these days he added 
the parents of the bride think that they are doing what they 
should do tak said they do not understand or do not care to 
understand all the nice legal things 
they believe that they are doing the right thing and a 
marriage should be a grand marriage he said 
that was apparent at vorawas 
as sonu and arjun fought sleep amid heat from the sacred fire 
and loud songs of the village women the elders held their own 
rite the opium ceremony 
the oldest man made a watery paste of opium which he offered to 
all 
you are required to drink it from his hand and then bless the 
newly wedded couple said a member of the group when he offers 
you the opium he is the giver in return you can give your 
blessings 
but the blessings must accompany some money another man 
advised just 51 rupees about 330 he whispered 
the groom is required to take an oath in front of a fire that 
personifies the fire god agni devta then the bride and the groom 
walk seven times around the flames 
hindus believe the fire god is the most powerful after the holy 
trinity of shiva the destroyer vishnu the protector and brahma the 
creator 
if either of them budge from the vow of being man and wife he 
or she will face the anger of the fire god said ratan lal a 
wedding guest 
for you this may appear terrible but for us it is natural 
tak said in villages we wonder why you marry at old age in the 
cities

two young white men have been 
convicted of murdering an 8yearold black boy who was struck in 
the skull by a paving stone hurled from the back of a 
fourwheeldrive vehicle 
according to testimony the young men were part of a group of 
high school students who skipped classes on oct 12 1987 and who 
decided to throw stones at pedestrians while on their way back from 
a picnic grounds where they had been drinking 
ronnie pitso 8 died of brain injuries after he was struck by a 
paving stone hurled by shane mitchell now 18 according to 
mondays judgment in johannesburg supreme court 
timothy beddingfield now 20 also was convicted of murder on 
the grounds that he knew the stone was about to be thrown and did 
nothing to stop mitchell 
sentencing was scheduled for may 22 
a murder conviction can carry the death penalty in south africa 
but that will not happen in this case because the court ruled that 
there were extenuating circumstances including the defendants age

dining out in beirut during lulls in the 
artillery battles between christians and moslems is pretty much a 
doityourself affair these days 
some restaurants that open for a few hours between bombardments 
now ask customers to bring their own bread 
and if theyve got anything else to vary the diet of canned 
food which most people live on for days on end while huddled in 
their bunkers they can bring that along as well 
the menus at restaurants like socrates and sofar which always 
were packed in the days when beirut was the playground of the 
middle east are pretty plain mainly homemade dishes of stew 
and rice 
only a few restaurants open during the lulls the seaside fish 
restraurants along the corniche which in quieter times are usually 
packed remain closed 
the syrians have positioned artillery and rocket launchers on 
the corniche to fire across the bay into the christian enclave 
which makes the area a target for retaliatory shellfire 
flour like sugar water and electricity is in short supply no 
one is starving but the belttightening has affected everyone 
the flour shortage has spawned bread mafias people who buy 
up as much flour as they can when its available then sell bread 
at high prices 
a crowd of about 50 people yelling and pushing were seen 
around a car in the street recently in the hamra district of moslem 
west beirut 
it looked like an accident but it was actually a man selling 
the flat loaves of pita bread the carload sold out in minutes 
despite the fact that it was four times the price before the latest 
round of fighting erupted march 8 
moslem militiamen in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley in east 
lebanon last week hijacked three truckloads of flour totalling 
about 75 tons heading for beirut 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the electricity shortages also have worsened the plight of the 
lebanese 
a european woman said she needed a whole week to watch the peter 
sellers movie being there because of the electricity rationing 
the woman who has lived in beirut for a year began watching 
the twohour videocassette one night last week but the power 
rationed to a random two hours a day went off after only a few 
minutes 
i thought id finish it the next day said the woman who 
asked that her name not be used i had no idea what time our turn 
for electricity was 
but at 555 am the lights suddenly came on in my apartment 
i wasnt wildly excited about getting up that early but i was 
anxious to finish the film even though i could hardly open my eyes 
i got up made a strong cup of coffee and was really getting 
into the movie when just like that the electricity went off 10 
minutes later it didnt come back all that day 
over the next days the electricity came on when i was out so 
i couldnt watch the film a friend who has a generator at home 
said i could finish it at his place but the videocassette got stuck 
in the player 
it took her three days to get it it out but she finally did get 
to see the movie all the way to the end

among the nearly 300 people killed since march 8 were four 
members of the itani family who are sunni moslem they died when a 
christian 155mm shell hit their home in west beirut 
ten other members of the family were wounded dragged from the 
rubble by civil defense rescue teams the rescuers frequently had 
to run for cover as more shells exploded around them in the 
indiscriminate barrage 
thats probably why they didnt notice the familys baby 
7monthold zeina buried under the debris her mother rana was 
among the dead 
several hours later the babys wounded relatives being treated 
at the american university hospital realized she was not accounted 
for and went back to their wrecked home to find her 
they clawed through the jagged concrete slabs until they found 
zeina who was not injured

not everyone curses the bombardments 
christian shells blew down an outside wall of one of the 
cellblocks in the gendarmerie prison in moslem west beiruts verdun 
district on one recent night 
the guards were in underground bunkers and 53 of the prisoners 
serving sentences for theft and drug trafficking escaped 
later 33 were rounded up the other 20 are still at large

the earths thin layer where plant roots seek 
water and nourishment is a world as mysterious as the distant 
planets says agriculture department scientist richard w zobel 
it is this layer or rhizosphere that determines what kind of 
crops can be grown if any and where so many of the earths people 
can live well 
zobel a plant geneticist said monday that the rhizosphere is a 
teeming world of minerals gases water and life forms insects 
earthworms microscopic nematode worms a host of microorganisms 
living and dead plant roots and the chemicals they exude 
we dont even begin to thoroughly understand it although 
were slowly pulling it together he said id say our 
knowledge of the area six inches to two feet below the soils 
surface is comparable to our knowledge of outer space right now 
zobel works for the departments agricultural research service 
at its ithaca ny laboratory 
one reason for lack of knowledge about the world at our feet is 
that only recently have we had the tools to study it and theyre 
still not up to the job he said soil physics and chemistry 
plant biology and physiology entomology and microbiology all 
provide tools but none of them is designed to work with more than 
a single microorganism or a single plant at a time 
and when a scientist has to put all these elements together 
and try to study them its tough zobel said we need to learn 
how microorganisms interact with the plant and with each other 
plant roots arent all the same theyre functionally different and 
have different growth patterns some die back every two weeks 
continually feeding the microorganisms in the soil 
zobel spoke monday at an annual symposium held by the agency at 
beltsville md his remarks were included in reports issued by the 
department 
topics in the fourday conference include genetic engineering 
and some of the new technologies for investigating the earths root 
zone 
one of scientists goals is to find ways to grow crops where 
they wont grow now because the soil is too wet dry or salty or 
has trace elements such as aluminum that can inhibit growth 
but we dont have the genetic information to manipulate the 
plants the way we need to do zobel said a lot of that 
information is below the surface of the soil i think were on the 
edge of a major revolution here and can begin to get handles on 
these things 
zobel said when scientists gain understanding of the 
rhizosphere a whole multitude of things will fall into place 
for example we could reduce chemical use on crops by knowing 
what biological elements in the soil will do the same thing he 
said that affects groundwater quality since you reduce the 
chances of chemicals moving into the water 
and if scientists could increase the ability of microorganisms 
to take nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into forms that 
plants can use it could mean a major reduction in fertilizer use 
were only beginning to understand that a plant has genes that 
control nitrogen fixation as well as the bacteria do so we can 
manipulate the plant end too zobel said thats an awful lot 
of information still to be discovered

monsanto agricultural co of st louis mo 
has been given permission by the agriculture department to conduct 
the first field testing of a genetically altered soybean variety 
the new variety which contains a petunia gene is expected to 
be unaffected by glyphosate a weedkiller sold by monsanto under 
the trade name roundup testing begins this month and will continue 
through the summer at sites in jerseyville ill whiteville 
tenn and stuttgart ark 
glyphosate tolerance in soybeans would offer new production 
possibilities to american farmers james w glosser 
administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service said monday a single herbicide could be used 
without fear of damaging the crop rather than the mixtures and 
multiple applications now necessary 
glosser said the agency has evaluated the scientific data and 
methods to be used in the field tests and found them to be well 
designed and environmentally safe 
monsanto scientists engineered the new variety by transferring a 
petunia gene to soybeans greenhouse studies showed the new soybean 
to be tolerant of glyphosate and now scientists want to test it 
under field conditions 
the usda also has issued permits to a number of companies for 
field testing of some other genetically altered crops including 
cotton and tomatoes to see if they are resistant to weedkilling 
chemicals

the sizzle in moonlighting has fizzled 
forcing abc to cancel its once popular hit after the 
tongueincheek detective series landed in the ratings basement 
moonlighting an instant hit for abc when it debuted four 
years ago with the zany antics of detectives david addison and 
maddie hayes will have its last original episode broadcast this 
sunday the network said monday 
the show made a star of bruce willis who played the 
freespirited david and was the comeback vehicle for cybill 
shepherd as the straightlaced maddie the bickering romance 
between the mismatched couple sparked sexual electricity 
tv by its very nature is cyclical and it would be foolish to 
expect moonlighting to continue indefinitely willis said 
monday 
when the show was at its height it was very much like playing 
a brand new song that had never been played before he said 
some people might not have liked the song we may not have always 
played it exactly to fit peoples taste but when we were on we 
hit some notes that will never be played again 
producercreator glenn carons witty dialogue and sometimes 
daring stories also were credited with wooing the audience he left 
the show after a creative dispute with miss shepherd 
in recent years the show also suffered production problems it 
began as one of the brightest spots on tuesday night but this 
season was pulled from the schedule and returned on sunday nights 
it was the seventh lowestrated show in last weeks ac nielsen 
co ratings 
we feel the show has reached a creative conclusion and that 
this is the appropriate time to end the series abcs statement 
said we are quite proud of the innovation which moonlighting 
brought to television during the past four years 
caron spofed the film noir of the 1940s with a black and white 
episode called the dream sequence always rings twice another 
episode was a sendup of shakespeares taming of the shrew 
the production schedule of moonlighting was at best chaotic 
caron often didnt complete a script before filming started the 
show fell behind schedule and frequently went into reruns 
the turning point came when miss shepherd became pregnant when 
the producers also chose to have maddie become pregnant the show 
went into a creative decline an old flame showed up for a 
whirlwind romance she also finally went to bed with david and 
david as well as the audience was left to guess who the father 
was 
the series also was forced to rely heavily on its secondary 
stars allyce beasley and curtis armstrong during miss shepherds 
absence when she returned the audience was further alienated by 
maddies quickie marriage to a man she met on a train the marriage 
was later annulled and in this seasons first episode maddie had a 
miscarriage 
its a sad time for all of us said executive producer jay 
daniel who succeeded caron weve all loved doing the show on 
the wrap shot i told the crew when they write the book on 
moonlighting it will begin it was the best of times the worst 
of times

a congressional drive to end 35 years of 
federal controls on natural gas prices has hit a rough patch in the 
senate but supporters and even some opponents predict the measure 
will win final approval 
a nearly identical decontrol bill gained easy approval by the 
house last month 
at a senate energy committee hearing monday some members raised 
questions about the effects of decontrol on natural gas prices and 
supplies but a majority hailed the legislation as a key to 
improving national energy supplies 
passage of this legislation will help ensure that natural 
gas can live up to its potential as a cleanburning abundant and 
domestically available fuel for americas future said sen j 
bennett johnston dla the bills sponsor 
the legislation would complete a price decontrol process that 
began in 1978 with the natural gas policy act which removed price 
limits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozen 
categories of gas each with a ceiling price 
about onethird of us natural gas currently is subject to 
federal price controls because most of the controlled gas is 
selling at prices below the federal ceilings the lifting of 
controls is not expected to have much shortterm effect 
looming over the decontrol debate is a growing consensus among 
experts that the industrys failure over the past two decades to 
fully replace its production with new discoveries will lead to a 
supply squeeze and price jump in the 1990s 
the natural gas trade organizations main argument in favor of 
decontrol is that it would help stimulate more drilling thus 
averting a crisis but critics say that argument is weakened by 
uncertainty about decontrols effects on prices if prices dont 
rise exploration generally would not be expected to increase 
j allen wampler an assistant energy secretary told mondays 
hearing that for at least the next year natural gas prices are more 
likely to fall than rise even if controls were ended 
sen howard metzenbaum a critic of past efforts to deregulate 
natural gas said the proposal would give the major gas producers 
freedom to raise prices without improving the nations longterm 
supply outlook 
we know that big oil ripped us off on the gasoline price 
hikes and now we are opening up yet another avenue for them to 
line their pockets at consumers expense the ohio democrat said 
he noted that amoco oil co is now the nations largest natural gas 
producer and that other oil giants are close behind 
a committee vote on the bill is not expected before midmonth 
despite the issues raised at the hearing eventual passage by the 
full senate is expected 
its likely itll go through edwin rothschild a vocal 
opponent said after the hearing he is assistant director of the 
citizenlabor energy coalition which has joined with other 
consumer organizations in trying to kill the bill 
sen dale bumpers dark said that while he was not opposed in 
principle to ending the price controls he would not support 
johnstons bill until the committee agreed to an amendment to 
redress what he called a serious injustice in his state 
bumpers said many arkansas landowners who signed royalty 
contracts with natural gas producers years ago were shortchanged by 
fine print in the contracts that paid them far less than the going 
rate he said he would try to stop the bill from leaving the 
committee until the contract problem was corrected 
also sen kent conrad dnd said he would try to stall the 
bill until he received explicit assurances that decontrol would not 
hurt the federally subsidized great plains project near beulah 
nd that makes natural gas from coal 
the ending of federal controls on natural gas prices is one of 
the bush adminstrations top energy priorities

adult cocaine abusers told interviewers 
they averaged nearly seven years of use without drugrelated 
problems a honeymoon period that might undercut warnings to 
adolescents about the drug a researcher says 
for some it may not be helpful to say coke is going to get 
you when they see adults day after day whove been using cocaine 
for years who arent in trouble yet said psychiatrist anne kolar 
but her study also found evidence that young people reach their 
first negative experience with cocaine sooner if further research 
bears that out publicizing it may make warnings to adolescents 
seem more credible she said 
the study by kolar and colleagues at the addiction research 
center in baltimore was presented monday at the american 
psychiatric associations annual meeting 
the information came from confidential interviews with 20 
adolescents ages 14 to 21 and 90 adults ages 26 to 53 who were 
being treated for cocaine abuse kolar cautioned the honeymoon 
perod data was based on a small sample 
the adults reported their first cocaine use at about age 22 
eightyeight percent said they had experienced at least one 
negative consequence of their cocaine use other than addiction 
before entering treatment on average the first problem appeared 
after 66 years of use 
the most common problem was a disturbing loss of touch with what 
was going on around them reported by 43 percent and first 
occurring an average of about five years after first use 
overdosing was reported by 28 percent at an average of about 
nine years and depression or paranoid thinking by 18 percent with 
averages of 10 years and 13 years respectively 
doing violence to others was reported by 18 percent with an 
average of five years and hurting oneself by 10 percent after 
seven years other problems were reported by 18 percent with an 
eightyear average 
overall the adults averaged 66 years before the first negative 
consequence of cocaine use researchers said 
in contrast the youths averaged far shorter intervals before 
the first negative consequence with only about a year before first 
overdose violence to others or disturbing loss of touch with what 
was going on around them for example 
perhaps the difference stems from an increased vulnerability of 
their developing brains kolar said 
but the concern is they may see adult users who appear not to 
have drugrelated problems she said 
kolar said she suspects that the recent popularity of a powerful 
form of cocaine called crack may shorten the honeymoon period 
for adults 
apart from that efforts to dissuade cocaine use might do well 
to copy antismoking campaigns that made tobacco socially 
unacceptable rather than simply warning about dangers she said 
frederick goodwin administrator of the federal alcohol drug 
and mental health administration said monday he believes warnings 
can remain part of a credible anticocaine campaign 
the idea is that using cocaine is like playing russian roulette 
so that one persons experience does not mean another persons will 
be the same he said 
he also said the honeymoon period with inhaled cocaine is 
quite variable and tends to be shorter in people with a family 
history of alcoholism 
goodwin said he was not familiar with kolars study but drug 
users may not give an accurate picture of how drug use affected 
their lives using other indicators such as interviews with spouses 
would be helpful he said

a federal judge threw out the department of 
veterans affairs rules on agent orange health benefits and 
ordered the government to reconsider claims by more than 31000 
veterans 
in a decision made public monday us district judge thelton 
henderson said the agency wrongly required proof that agent orange 
causes various diseases in denying most claims for benefits related 
to the herbicide 
henderson ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of 
agent orange claimants said the agency formerly known as the 
veterans administration failed to give veterans the benefit of the 
doubt 
these errors especially sharply compounded with one another 
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants henderson 
said 
henderson struck down regulations denying agent orange 
serviceconnected benefits for cancers and all other diseases 
except chloracne a nonfatal skin condtion he also ordered the 
agency to reopen all claims denied under those rules 
this is a major victory with farreaching implications mary 
stout president of the 35000member vietnam veterans of america 
said in a statement 
the ruling validates what vietnam veterans have been saying 
for years that the va has failed to give agent orange victims a 
fair hearing she said i am optimistic that congress will now 
act quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the vietnam 
war 
the government is expected to appeal the decision the va was 
represented by the justice department 
justice spokeswoman amy brown declined to comment on hendersons 
ruling saying department lawyers had not yet seen it she said the 
department would review the ruling before deciding its next step 
agent orange whose toxic ingredient is dioxin was used as a 
defoliant by the united states in vietnam its health effects are 
sharply disputed 
the va relying on a review by an 11member scientific 
committee ruled in 1985 that only chloracne could be considered a 
serviceconnected effect of exposure to agent orange 
henderson rejected a challenge by the veterans group to the 
scientific committees review of studies on agent oranges effects 
but the judge said the standards the va used in making its rules 
violated a 1984 federal law that was supposed to help vietnam 
veterans get health benefits due them 
henderson said the va improperly required proof of a 
causeandeffect relationship between the herbicide and a disease 
for which benefits would be granted instead he said the agency 
should have required only that statistics show a significant 
correlation between dioxin exposure and a disease or an 
increased risk of incidence 
the federal law does not spell out the proper standard but 
comments by members of congress involved in passing the law showed 
they opposed an overly stringent standard and felt causeandeffect 
proof was unnecessary henderson said 
the judge noted that the va had relied on statistical 
relationships without requiring proof of the cause in granting 
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease 
congress did the same thing in granting benefits to former 
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases henderson said 
the judge found a second error in the vas refusal to apply to 
its agent orange regulations the same benefitofthedoubt 
policy it uses for review of individual benefit cases which favors 
the veteran in close questions 
although the laws language is unclear its remedial purpose 
favors a lenient standard henderson said noting that veterans 
would be entitled to a favorable standard if they made individual 
claims he said congress would not have intended to put them in a 
worse position through collective regulation 
vietnam veterans of america spokesman barry kasinitz said the 
group will again sponsor agent orange legislation 
the measure would require agent orange benefits for two kinds of 
cancer softtissue sarcoma and nonhodgkins lymphoma and to 
establish a new scientific panel independent of the va to study the 
herbicides health effects the senate passed a similar bill last 
year but it died in the house kasinitz said

secretary of state james a baker iii 
will ask mikhail s gorbachev for help in forging peace in the 
middle east if the soviet leader proves to be sincere about global 
cooperation a senior official says 
en route monday to moscow to meet with the general secretary 
baker said his goal is to make it clear to the soviets that we 
are seeking an active constructive positive and expanding 
relationship 
if we find that the soviet union is serious about new global 
behavior then we will seek diplomatic engagement in an effort to 
reach mutually beneficial results baker said 
a senior official expanded on those remarks telling reporters 
on bakers flight from washington that the bush administration 
would welcome moscows help promoting arabisraeli negotiations and 
was not trying to exclude the soviets from those peace efforts 
we ought not to somehow be worried about the soviet union 
being a participant in trying to enhance the prospects for peace in 
the middle east the official said the problems there are 
extraordinarily intractable we welcome all the help we can get 
but the official who responded to questions only on condition 
of anonymity ruled out us concessions in afghanistan or 
negotiations to remove shortrange nuclear missiles from europe 
he insisted the soviets should suspend their military aid to the 
marxist government of nicaragua estimated at 500 million a year 
and show interest in a peaceful solution in the middle east by 
resuming diplomatic relations with israel and exerting influence on 
syria 
the official said the united states would not stop aiding the 
afghan rebels in their war with the kabul government which was 
supplied with soviet arms and equipment before the red army left 
the country in february 
baker who has never been to the soviet union before is due in 
moscow on wednesday morning for talks with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze they plan to meet again thursday morning 
and baker will see gorbachev for two hours in the afternoon 
the us entourage including state department pentagon and 
national security council officials stopped first in helsinki to 
rest confer and meet with finnish officials 
baker met with shevardnadze in vienna in march before the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact opened 
negotiations to reduce nonnuclear armor and artillery in europe 
since then a us dispute with west germany over natos 
shortrange nuclear missiles has rattled the western alliances 
unity 
the germans are resisting us efforts to more than triple the 
missiles range to 250 miles and are demanding us negotiations 
with the soviets to reduce tactical nuclear weapons on both sides 
the bush administration has refused arguing that would hurt 
natos defenses 
if gorbachev tries to capitalize on the disagreement baker 
simply will refuse to discuss the missiles the official said 
he predicted the alliance will resolve the problem before or at 
the nato summit meeting president bush will attend with the leaders 
of the 15 other allied countries may 2930 in brussels 
baker intends to give priority during his moscow meetings to the 
proliferation of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons which has 
alarmed the bush administration 
baker will press the soviets to reconsider joining a 
sevennation western control group seeking to end the sale of 
ballistic missile technology to third world nations the official 
said 
the group known formerly as the missile technology control 
regime was formed in april 1987 by six nato allies france west 
germany italy britain canada and the us and japan to ban the 
export of missiles and related technology to be used to build 
missiles capable of carrying a payload 168 miles or more

naguib mahfouz winner of the 1988 nobel 
prize in literature is as unruffled by death threats from moslem 
fundamentalists as he is by his new wealth and international 
acclaim 
at my age theres no fear about being killed said the 
frail 77yearold writer as he sat at his usual table by the 
picture window of ali baba a cafe overlooking downtown cairos 
busy tahrir square i refused police protection because this 
would tie down my freedom of movement 
as he spoke he slowly sipped turkish coffee without sugar 
because hes diabetic 
mahfouz the first author who writes in arabic to receive the 
nobel literary prize is a man of routine and his routine has not 
changed in the month since an egyptian fundamentalist sheik 
declared him an apostate a rebel against his religion 
islam decrees that he must repent or die said sheik omar 
abdelrahman who had been acquitted of charges he instigated the 
1981 assassination of president anwar sadat with a similar 
proclamation 
security authorities say there are some young extremists who 
might act on abdelrahmans words mahfouz said they advised 
me to accept protection 
abdelrahmans declaration did not arouse the reaction among 
many moslems abroad as did condemnation of moslemborn british 
writer salman rushdie 
rushdie has been in hiding since feb 14 when iranian leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said his novel the satanic verses 
blasphemes islam and ordered the authors death the book has been 
banned in predominantly moslem countries including egypt 
on this day as always mahfouz walked alone to the ali baba 
cafe about a halfhour from his home where he lives with his 
wife atyatallah and two grown daughters he travels the same 
route every day and said he has no intention of changing it 
despite the anxiety of family and security authorities 
the author of works including 40 novels still goes to his friday 
literary meetings at a nile riverside restaurant and to thursday 
gettogethers with a poet an actor and three other close friends 
nothing has changed for me mahfouz said about the impact of 
the nobel prize money a 390000 award that his daughters traveled 
to sweden in december to receive mahfouzs delicate health 
including impaired eyesight and hearing kept him at home 
he said he divided the money equally among himself his wife and 
his two daughters mahfouz donated his quarter to a charity 
organization at alahram a staterun newspaper and mahfouzs 
longtime employer 
alahram was at the center of a controversy 30 years ago that 
led to mahfouzs current friction with fundamentalists in 1959 
the newspapers serialization of mahfouzs children of gebelawi 
drew the attention of the sheiks at alazhar the cairo institution 
that is islams center of theology 
they immediately banned it as blasphemous and spoke of trying 
mahfouz for apostasy because the book wrongly depicted biblical 
figures 
the ban never was lifted but mahfouz was left in peace after 
his nobel triumph alazhar leaders received mahfouz warmly at the 
venerated institute 
a new threat arose in early april with sheik abdelrahmans 
fatwa or religious opinion that the book proved mahfouz had 
abandoned islam and unless he repented must be killed under islamic 
law 
nobody outside fayoum abdelrahmans hometown southwest of 
cairo knew of the proclamation until the blind cleric repeated the 
opinion in an interview published on april 13 with the kuwaiti 
newspaper alanbaa 
abdelrahman had been arrested a week earlier for leading an 
antigovernment demonstration in fayoum 
the interview was not published in egypt and had no noticeable 
effect 
mahfouz was among moslems who condemned khomeinis call for 
rushdies death saying it amounted to terrorism against 
humanity because it is against thought and against human rights 
nevertheless he said rushdies the satanic verses was 
repugnant and that he supported a boycott of its publishers 
mahfouz said abdelrahmans condemnations followed a campaign 
against mahfouzs writings by fundamentalist publications that 
began soon after he won the nobel prize in october 
the campaign was a sort of provocation and the security 
authorities became more worried after abdelrahmans comments 
mahfouz said my wife and daughters also asked me to change my 
lifestyle 
but i cant

sickness keeps women away from their jobs 
slightly more often than men according to a study by the national 
center for health statistics 
a study between 1983 and 1985 of the health of workers found 
that women averaged 55 sick days annually compared with 43 
missed days of work for men 
reasons were not included however there could be many 
possibilities said john gary collins one of the authors 
the labor department however did suggest reasons in a 1985 
survey that found 37 percent of men and 63 percent of women 
missed a day of work in a given week 
understandably women have higher incidences of absenteeism 
during their childbearing years especially women with children 
under age 6 the departments analysis said for most women the 
period of lost time increases with the presence of children 
time taken off to give birth does not count in the absenteeism 
statistics collins said 
the health figures for men and women issued monday are the first 
published portion of a more extensive analysis that will eventually 
include comparisons of health and sick time by income education 
and other variables 
collins said that comparative figures for men and women which 
the center has not collected before were included in this study 
because women now comprise such a large portion of the work force 
44 percent at the time of the study 
the study found that 112 percent of women took eight or more 
sick days a year while 7 percent of men had eight or more days of 
lost work 
the most sick days on average were taken by women in the 
transportation and materials moving industries at 93 women 
machine operators assemblers and inspectors averaged 87 lost work 
days female handlers equipment cleaners helpers and operators 
lost 79 days and 75 days were lost by women precision production 
craft and repair workers 
for men machine operators assemblers and inspectors was the 
category with the most lost days at 63 men in transportation 
missed 57 days followed by 52 for farming fishing and forestry 
workers and 51 for male handlers equipment cleaners and helpers 
the fewest lost work days were 30 for men in the professions 
and 33 for women working in farming forestry and fishing 
asked to assess their own health the largest groups saying they 
were in poor health were women doing household work 19 percent 
and men working in farming fishing and forestry 108 percent 
those same categories were the ones in which people tended to 
report being hindered by chronic conditions of one sort or another 
farming and household workers tend to be older and thus are 
more likely to have chronic conditions and poor health collins 
said 
the study also compared the rates of six chronic conditions 
among working men and women 
men led in high blood pressure 1180 per 1000 compared with 
1026 per 1000 women men were also more likely to be hearing 
impaired 1022 per 1000 compared with 556 for women 
women had more hay fever 1183 compared with 983 men per 
1000 other rates were for chronic sinusitis 1813 for women and 
1448 for men arthritis 1240 for women and 883 for men and 
impairment or deformity of the back 822 for women and 651 for 
men 
the analysis was based on a survey of 117000 households 
containing 303000 people the margin of error was not reported in 
the study

police have been investigating 
allegations that some singers had to pay bribes of up to 85000 to 
perform in the san remo festival italys most popular annual 
popsong contest 
court sources said monday that the results of the twomonth 
investigation have been given to ugo giudiceandrea the chief 
prosecutor in rome who will decide whether to file charges 
police said the charges under consideration include extortion 
and fraud 
police sources in this gambling resort along the italian riviera 
indicated that littleknown singers and their recording companies 
paid bribes ranging from 42500 to 85000 to appear in the 
contest 
the show can boost a singers popularity and royalties because 
it is telecast nationally on the statecontrolled network for three 
straight nights 
the italian media has identified a few singers and some 
companies that have contended they paid bribes but police have not 
confirmed the reports 
the news reports said several singers began irate protests and 
filed suits after they said they paid bribes and were entered in 
the contest but never appeared on television 
a jury named by the private organization that runs the contest 
selected songs and singers for the 39th edition of the festival in 
february 
adriano aragozzini who headed the organization was quoted by 
milans daily corriere della sera as saying im not involved in 
the scandal if someone got the money for entering singers in the 
competition hes was not part of my party 
teddy reno the managerhusband of italian singer rita pavone 
said it has long been a practice in san remo to select singers on 
the basis of many reasons but artistic quality 
he added however that he was not asked for any money to have 
his wife selected for this years contest pavones song was 
eliminated by the jury 
the most popular italian pop singers such as jovanotti anna 
oxa fausto leali albano and his american wife romina power 
competed in the contest which also had separate sections for 
emerging and new artists

a house panel is calling on two reagan cabinet 
members to address an officials claim that he was unfairly singled 
out in a probe of favoritism in a 225 million federal housing 
program 
a house government operations subcommittee monday said it would 
seek the testimony of former housing and urban development 
secretary samuel pierce and former interior secretary james watt to 
help evaluate former federal housing commissioner thomas demerys 
claims 
demery was targeted in a hud inspector generals report two 
weeks ago that alleged a perception of favoritism in awarding 
money to renovate housing for the poor hud secretary jack kemp 
temporarily halted the program and blocked some 100 million 
pending contracts 
an angry demery who complained about being singled out for 
top billing told the subcommittee on employment and housing 
monday that the report by inspector general paul a adams was 
motivated by malice negligence and a coverup or a combination 
of the three 
demery testified that problems existed in the moderate 
rehabilitation program before he assumed his post in october 
1986 he served until last november 
demery said one of his hud predecessors silvio debartolomeis 
was reluctant to sign funding requests for the program in 1986 he 
also questioned why deborah gore dean former executive assistant 
to pierce was mentioned only briefly in the 700page report 
demery made a lot of statements on the record that need to be 
verified by future witnesses said subcommittee member rep 
christopher shays rconn 
adams told the committee poor documentation contributed to the 
problem and said highly paid consultants including former hud or 
other government officials used their clout to win contracts for 
developers 
the subcommittee wants watt president reagans first interior 
secretary to testify about his work as consultant on behalf of a 
312unit project in essex md watt earned a 300000 fee despite 
indicating that he had little knowledge of the program adams said 
mr watts only known experience in the field of housing was 
making bambi homeless said rep tom lantos dcalif 
other consultants included the late john mitchell attorney 
general under president nixon former republican sen ed brooke of 
massachusetts former kentucky gov louis nunn also a republican 
and other top hud officials under pierce

two scientists who say they achieved nuclear 
fusion at room temperature appeared before nearly 2000 fellow 
chemists monday night to counter critics who doubt their claim 
martin fleischmann and b stanley pons disputed critics who 
accused them of sloppy measurements saying scientists who have 
been unable to duplicate their experiments failed to use large 
enough electrodes made of the metal palladium 
in their latest experiment they said they produced up to 50 
times more energy with their device than what they had put it the 
energy was emitted as a burst of heat that lasted two days they 
said 
in their initial announcement in march they said they had 
produced four times the amount of energy than was used 
pons of the university of utah and fleischmann of the 
university of southampton in england announced march 23 that they 
achieved nuclear fusion in a jar at room temperature 
such an accomplishment if confirmed could lead to a cheap and 
virtually inexhaustible source of energy 
the two scientists said they did it by sending a current through 
an apparatus in which a palladium electrode was wrapped in platinum 
and soaked in a container of heavy water heavy water is made from 
an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium and oxygen 
last week delegates at the american physical society meeting in 
baltimore accused the utahbased pons and fleischmann of 
experimental errors 
some critics said pons and fleischmann were deluded into 
thinking that their device produced excess heat through fusion 
because they measured temperatures in the jar improperly and were 
actually measuring hot spots 
however fleischmann appearing before 1800 scientists at a 
meeting of the electrochemical society inc at the bonaventure 
hotel here said there were no hot spots in his fusion device and 
that the excess heat measurements were accurate 
he even showed a short movie of gas bubbling through the fusion 
device to support his claim that heat was distributed evenly 
throughout the apparatus 
this argument of ineffective heat mixing really doesnt hold 
water fleischmann said 
pons said scientists who have been unable to reproduce the 
ponsfleischmann teams findings failed to use adequately large 
palladium electrodes 
using technical language he lashed out at critics who contend 
that neutrons allegedly generated by fusion in the experiment may 
really have come from naturally occurring radon gas and radiation 
in the utah laboratory 
he said that he and fleischmann measured gamma rays an 
indication of neutrons and thus fusion that came from their 
experimental device but were not present elsewhere in the lab 
but chemist nathan lewis of the california institute of 
technology who said at the american physical society meeting that 
the experiment was done sloppily reiterated his criticism monday 
night 
there is no gamma radiation lewis said there is no 
fusion 
stan luckhardt of the massachusetts institute of technology also 
strongly questioned the gammaray aspects of the utah findings 
fleischmann acknowledged that the gammaray evidence was the 
least satisfactory part of their research we are doing a 
complete new set of measurements with improved techniques he 
said 
the meeting was the first appearance by pons and fleischmann 
before their fellow electrochemists although they previously 
discussed their findings at a meeting of the american chemical 
society 
before the session started scientists eager for more 
information on the scientific controversy were forced to crowd like 
sardines into a hotel hallway while electrochemical society 
officials prepared the meeting room 
security guards repeatedly had to ask people to stand back and 
not rush into the meeting room once the doors were opened 
also present monday night was steven jones of brigham young 
university who showed a series of slides of 3yearold notebook 
pages to refute accusations that he borrowed heavily from pons and 
fleischmanns work 
jones said his experiment and a more recent one conducted by 
scientists at the university of bologna in italy found unambiguous 
signs of fusion neutrons released by such a reaction 
he also said that he conducted his experiments with proper 
scientific controls finding neutrons when deuterium was used but 
not when regular water was used 
he said that an editorial in the british journal nature 
suggesting he did not use proper controls was just a mistake by 
the editor a diatribe 
since the march announcement pons and fleischmann have been 
called incompetent and deluded and a number of researchers 
have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate the experiment 
physicists who have spent billions in pursuit of 
hightemperature fusion have been the most vocal critics of pons 
and fleischmanns experiment 
the two said their experiment yielded more than four times the 
energy that produced it 
their claim to roomtemperature fusion could undercut the 
longheld belief that the process which powers the sun and 
hydrogen bombs occurs only at extremely high temperatures

a robot probe was flying right on 
target to venus and atlantis astronauts landed here after a 
successful fourday space shuttle mission that put us planetary 
exploration back on track 
at edwards air force base calif initial inspections of the 
shuttle showed little damage to the thermal tiles the national 
aeronautics and space administration said 
the vehicle looks as clean as any one that ive ever seen 
said navy rear adm richard truly nasas acting associate 
administrator for space flight 
commander david walker pilot ronald grabe and mission 
specialists mary cleave mark lee and norman thagard were greeted 
at ellington field late monday by 200 relatives friends 
coworkers and even a few of the family dogs 
its really nice to have the mission finished and we couldnt 
have done it without you said ms cleave who helped deploy the 
magellan probe 
she said the astronauts had a great time and it was good to be 
back knowing that theres a spacecraft en route to venus and we 
were all a part of it 
after returning to work today the crew planned to view 
photographs taken during their 168millionmile journey johnson 
space center officials said 
on wednesday the astronauts will begin briefing officials 
the 97ton atlantis glided to a smooth landing as scheduled at 
343 pm edt monday afternoon 
twelve minutes before touchdown the crew was ordered to land on 
a concrete runway rather than a hardpacked clay runway because 
crosswinds on the runway were too high 
obviously this mission was an outstanding success nasa 
science chief lennard fisk told reporters at edwards air force base 
magellan is on its way to venus the deployment was very 
successful the trajectory is about as accurate as you can get the 
spacecraft is working without any difficulties whatsoever 
truly praised the performances of the crew the shuttle and the 
magellan 
with all these things coming together its really hard not to 
have a big grin on your face and be proud of what were doing 
truly said 
about 27500 spectators the smallest crowd ever to attend a 
shuttle landing withstood the 90degree heat to watch the 
smallest previous crowd was 35000 in 1985 an estimated 460000 
were here for discoverys landing march 18 
thursdays deployment of magellan was the missions primary goal 
the 550million magellan mission is the first us planetary 
probe launched in 11 years and the first ever from a shuttle in 
october another atlantis crew is to start the galileo on its way 
to jupiter 
early today magellan was more than 676000 miles from earth and 
was zipping along at a rate of nearly 6000 mph it will travel 806 
million miles and loop 1 times around the sun before reaching 
venus in august 1990 
once in orbit above the cloudshrouded planet the probe will 
use its high resolution radar to map up to 90 percent of the 
venusian surface 
the radar images to be collected by magellan are expected to 
show features as small as a football field and be 10 times clearer 
than pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft the pictures should 
provide an avalanche of data that could help scientists discover 
how venus evolved so differently from earth 
the weight of the probe and its rocket booster 45000 pounds 
restricted the number of experiments the shuttle could carry 
the crew did work on an experiment involving crystallizing a 
metal sample in a furnace and photographed lightning and pollution 
on earth 
the only glitch reported occurred sunday when one of the 
shuttles four main computers failed and the crew replaced it with 
the onboard spare 
the problem posed no threat to the flight but ground 
controllers decided to take no chances and had the spare installed 
nasa said the shuttle could land with only one computer

here but legislation is needed to provide the funds to pay for it 
smithsonian secretary robert mcc adams on monday signed an 
agreement to take title to new york citys heye foundation 
collection the worlds premier collection of american indian 
artifacts 
i dont think there ever will have been a museum quite like 
the one we foresee with great confidence going up on the site 
behind me adams said at the signing ceremony 
roland force director of the new yorkbased museum of the 
american indian that currently houses the collection presented 
adams with a peace pipetomahawk given to tecumseh the shawnee 
chief by col henry a proctor of the british army in 1812 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii chairman of the select 
committee on indian affairs pledged to introduce a bill this week 
to begin efforts to secure the money 
the smithsonian would build the museum in the last available 
space on the mall between the air and space museum and the 
capitol it also agreed to construct additional storage space for 
the collection in suitland md 
in addition to transferring the bulk of the heye foundation 
collection to washington the accord calls for moving the museum of 
the american indian from its cramped location in new york city to a 
larger federally owned building there the facility would be 
renamed the george gustav heye center of the national museum of the 
american indian and display a small portion of the 1 millionpiece 
collection 
adams estimated it would take six years before the washington 
museums doors open in addition to securing financing the plan 
must be approved by new york state courts 
earlier this year adams estimated the project would cost more 
than 150 million

and plans to open a club in the beale street entertainment district 
next year his manager says 
king got his professional start and his stage name in memphis in 
the late 1940s 
after all he is named bb king which is beale street blues 
boy and that goes back to the basic roots manager sid 
sidenberg said monday by telephone from new york 
from the late 1800s through the 1950s beale street was a 
bustling entertainment and commercial district for blacks recent 
efforts to develop it into a major tourist center have been 
disappointing 
sidenberg said the district is coming along however and the 
time is right for the blues guitarist and singer to give it a try 
we decided to open up a club so we can use it as sort of a 
sounding board for new talent as well as bb himself coming down 
and having fun playing in his hometown sidenberg said 
king will move his primary residence from las vegas to memphis 
but will still be on the road most of the time sidenberg said

the latest round of cambodian peace 
talks ended in a rosy glow of optimism but the hard bargaining has 
yet to begin 
the encouraging results in jakarta the unprecedented dialogue 
in recent months and the general warming of ties among the united 
states china and the soviet union have created a momentum toward 
peace differences still divide the warring factions in cambodia 
however 
in the jargon of negotiators the quest for an end to cambodias 
10year jungle war is divided into external and internal 
factors 
the external include the withdrawal of vietnams troops and the 
halt of outside aid to the warring guerrilla factions the big 
internal factor is how the factions will share power 
vietnam has promised to withdraw the last of its estimated 
50000 to 70000 soldiers by the end of september regardless of 
whether a political settlement is reached 
the warring factions have agreed to allow international 
observers to monitor the withdrawal details are to be worked out 
at an international conference in paris july 2425 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev confers with chinese 
leader deng xiaoping in beijing may 1518 in the first chinasoviet 
summit in 30 years the cambodian question a major obstacle in 
normalizing relations between the two nations is expected to be 
high on the agenda 
the vietnamese communists and cambodian khmer rouge guerrillas 
came to power in the spring of 1975 defeating usbacked 
governments in south vietnam and cambodia 
the khmer rouge forcibly tried to turn cambodia into an agrarian 
commune and hundreds of thousands of people died in purges or of 
starvation 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted the khmer 
rouge and set up another communist government 
moscow has supported vietnam and its regime in phnom penh 
beijing has backed the khmer rouge still widely feared by many 
cambodians and now the strongest of three factions in a guerrilla 
resistance coalition 
some officials fear the soviet union and china could reach 
agreement swiftly and as in afghanistan give up their supporting 
roles in the conflict before the cambodian rivals have made peace 
they fear the civil war would only drag on in such a situation 
persistent but unconfirmed reports say the soviets seeking 
better relations with china and noncommunist southeast asian 
nations and an end to costly foreign military involvements have 
been pressuring vietnam for a speedy withdrawal 
peace negotiations began in july after years of deadlock when 
indonesia played host for informal talks involving most of those 
involved 
the most important development came last week when guerrilla 
coalition leader prince norodom sihanouk 67 said he would return 
to cambodia as head of state if the vietnamese pullout is 
independently confirmed and the constitution rewritten to his 
satisfaction 
sihanouks supporters and the noncommunist khmer peoples 
national liberation front are the other groups in the guerrilla 
coalition 
diplomatic observers say sihanouk seems ready to return with or 
without the khmer rouge guerrillas who are said to be worried they 
might be left out of a peace settlement 
the khmer rouge was not directly represented at the jakarta 
talks sihanouk dismissed them as only interested in continuing the 
war and he quoted cambodian premier hun sen as saying let them 
stay in the jungle 
hun sen and sihanouk insist that pol pot and other khmer rouge 
founders be barred from any future government and the resistance 
wants to reach a political settlement with hun sen before vietnam 
withdraws its forces 
without such an agreement there is concern the khmer rouge 
might regain power in phnom penh because of their superior military 
capability 
however in a joint declaration last month vietnam and cambodia 
said that if any of the guerrilla factions continued to receive 
outside aid the cambodian government reserves the right to call 
for outside help 
the united states which provides the guerrillas of sihanouk and 
former premier son sann with diplomatic support and nonlethal aid 
stepped up its campaign against the khmer rouge as the jakarta 
meeting began 
the united states is totally opposed to a return to dominance 
in cambodia by the khmer rouge said state department spokeswoman

tests will begin soon in england on the safety 
of a proposed vaccine for aids an american researcher says 
allan goldstein an aids researcher at the george washington 
university school of medicine said 24 volunteers are being sought 
in london to test the safety of a vaccine known as hgp30 
the volunteers he said must be free of any aids infection a 
second 24 to be used as a control group also will be selected 
goldstein said the purpose of the yearlong trial is to 
determine if the candidate vaccine is safe to use on humans 
earlier tests on laboratory animals did not reveal any problems of 
toxicity or other adverse effects he said 
control trials in the united states have not started goldstein 
said because the drug has not been approved by the food and drug 
administration for human experimentation 
in laboratory tests goldstein said hgp30 has been shown to 
stimulate the production of antibodies which attack and kill both 
the aids virus and cells in the body that are infected with the 
aids virus 
two other vaccines developed by other researchers are also in 
early safety trials according to an fda spokesman

military weather reconnaissance flights should 
not be halted because they provide necessary lastminute 
warning to coastal areas when a hurricane is approaching says 
sen lloyd bentsen 
but defense secretary dick cheney contends the flights which 
help forecasters predict the intensity and position of an 
approaching hurricane are not an air force mission 
as a budgetcutting move cheney wants to deactivate the weather 
reconnaissance units at keesler air force base in mississippi at a 
savings of 14 million bentsen contends the total annual cost is 
closer to 25 million 
bentsen dtexas is asking sen daniel k inouye chairman of 
the senate defense appropriations subcommittee to continue funding 
the air forces flights into the eye of an approaching hurricane 
bentsen said the cost is a mere fraction of the destruction that 
could occur if coastal residents dont have the flights 
lastminute warning needed to protect lives and property 
unless the money is provided in next years budget bentsen said 
the flights could be halted sept 30 in this decade alone eight 
major hurricanes have hit the united states after oct 1

the mcdonnell douglas corp won almost 29 
billion in defense research contracts last year easily retaining 
its top position in the field the defense department says 
the martin marietta corp ranked second for the second year in a 
row with contracts totaling 203 billion the pentagon added 
among educational and nonprofit entities the massachusetts 
institute of technology continued to hold the top ranking winning 
research contracts during the year worth 4037 million the 
aerospace corp of el segundo calif was close behind with 
contracts worth 367 million followed by johns hopkins university 
with 3539 million 
overall the pentagon increased its spending on research by just 
over 3 percent in fiscal 1988 with awards worth a total of 225 
billion by contrast the department spent 218 billion on 
research in fiscal 1987 
a great deal of last years spending appeared to be related to 
work on the star wars antimissile defense system the amount 
of money invested in research on missile and space systems 
totaled 78 billion in fiscal 1988 or 346 percent of the total 
the pentagon said 
those numbers were little changed from fiscal 1987 when missile

insurance industry groups are accusing 
consumer organizations of using distorted statistics to support 
their arguments that industry inefficiency costs motorists up to 
20 billion a year in increased premiums 
five consumer groups outlining a program they said could save 
the average household as much as 277 a year on car insurance said 
monday the most important proposed changes were aimed at reducing 
insurer waste and inefficiency 
in particular the consumer groups said they want measures taken 
to increase competition in auto insurance markets and to correct 
the industrys cost passthrough methods of ratemaking under 
which profits rise with costs 
the enactment of such measures has the potential to reduce the 
up to 20 billion in insurer waste and inefficiency by 8 billion 
to 12 billon a year the organizations said 
lowell r beck president of the national association of 
independent insurers responded the 20 billion figure of 
industry waste is drawn out of the air and is totally without proof 
or foundation 
the american insurance association in a separate statement 
said the allegations of insurer inefficiency are based on 
distorted statistics in fact insurers are efficient when compared 
to many other industries such as banking the alleged inefficiency 
is a smokescreen to prevent control of runaway lawsuit costs which 
neither insurers nor consumers can afford 
the consumer federation of america consumers union national 
insurance consumer organization us public interest research 
group and public citizen announced their proposal at a news 
conference 
this program is demanding but feasible said joan claybrook 
president of public citizen a group associated with consumer 
advocate ralph nader it should be embraced by the auto insurance 
industry 
the proposal calls for repeal of antitrust exemptions for the 
insurance industry that are contained in the mccarranferguson act 
passed in 1945 it also calls for the repeal of state laws 
prohibiting group sales and discounts by agents 
it proposes measures to make more price information available to 
consumers and the establishment of independent advocates to 
represent the consumer point of view in government rate proceedings 
the proposal also calls for requiring safety features in light 
trucks and vans widespread installation of airbags increased use 
of safety belts and motorcyclehelmet laws 
stephen brobeck executive director of consumer federation of 
america said the report explains how to lower auto insurance 
rates by 15 billion to 23 billion 
this would save the average household 181 to 277 brobeck 
said

the constitution doesnt guarantee programs 
for the mentally retarded living at home a us appeals court 
ruled in reversing a judges decision 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals rejected arguments that 
cuts in services to the mentally retarded in philadelphia violated 
rights to equal protection and due process 
it is impossible to find an affirmative state duty to protect 
the mentally retarded living at home the three appeals judges 
said monday 
a group of 32 mentally retarded people and the phildelphia 
police and fire association for handicapped children inc filed 
suit in july after the city cut off services to 9000 in a 
costcutting measure 
attorney david ferleger who represented the plaintiffs said he 
was very disheartened by the ruling he said it would be 
appealed 
in november us district judge raymond j broderick ordered 
the city and state to continue providing the programs three months 
later broderick ruled the state in contempt of his decision and 
forced it to pay the city 493 million for the programs 
the appeals court said the city could classify retarded 
residents living with relatives and those at group homes 
differently for a legitimate purpose 
jurisprudence on the equal protection clause recognizes that 
the act of governing often requires a state to bestow a benefit on 
some but not all of its citizens wrote chief judge john j 
gibbons 
the panel rejected the lower courts ruling that the decision to 
single out those living at home was arbitrary and irrational 
saying the action followed the citys desire to reduce spending 
with a minimal disruption to the system 
the court said even if retarded patients living at home 
regressed because of the cutback relatives might be willing to 
continue providing care 
but if cutbacks at community homes caused regression the staffs 
might be unable to handle the increased demands forcing the 
patients to enter institutions the court said 
to minimize the cuts city officials opted to curtail services 
they considered less critical such as casemanagement and 
familysupport services and maintain services they considered 
vital such as vocational training 
philadelphia solicitor seymour kurland and a spokeswoman for the 
department of public welfare which administers the states 
programs for the retarded could not be reached for comment monday

massachusetts officials and other opponents of 
the seabrook nh nuclear plant are urging federal regulators to 
delay approval of a license that would permit lowpower testing at 
the plant 
seabrook foes filed a 10page stay request monday with the 
nuclear regulatory commission the last regulatory maneuver in a 
prolonged campaign to block a lowpower license 
it would be arbitrary and capricious to issue the license 
in light of the great uncertainty that seabrook will ever 
receive an operating license wrote lawyers for massachusetts 
the town of hampton nh and the new england coalition on nuclear 
pollution 
the opponents cited seabrooks financial condition the lead 
owner has filed for bankruptcy protection coupled with geographic 
and demographic conditions around the plant that they say make it 
virtually impossible to provide adequate sheltering or reasonably 
prompt evacuations seabrook must have evacuation plans approved 
to receive a fullpower commercial license 
opponents argue that conducting lowpower tests could endanger 
workers and residents make decommissioning much more expensive and 
eliminate the chances of converting the 6 billion plant to another 
form of energy production 
even temporary operation at low power will result in 
irreversible plant contamination caused by radiation of the reactor 
and its component parts and the creation of highlevel radioactive 
waste the opponents said in the petition should a 
radiological accident occur at the seabrook plant it could cause 
irreversible health damage to the population around the plant 
if the nrc refuses the stay request the license will be issued 
immediately according to a march commission order that decision 
can come any time after friday the deadline for the plant owners 
to respond to mondays stay request 
but the opponents also asked the nrc to grant a oneweek 
housekeeping stay if the commission rules against the initial 
petition that would give the opposition enough time to seek a 
courtordered stay pending a court appeal attorneys argued 
the opponents asked for a decision within two days on whether 
they would receive the weeklong postponement if the initial stay 
is rejected 
if not told that by wednesday we intend to go to federal 
court by the end of the week massachusetts attorney general 
james shannon said in a telephone interview from boston shannon 
said the appeal would be filed in the us circuit court of appeals 
here 
nrc spokesman john kopeck declined comment on the stay requests 
noting only that the commissioners schedule calls for a decision 
after the plants owners file their counterarguments 
seabrook officials say they are ready to begin preparations for 
lowpower testing within 24 hours of receiving the license

a judge ordered the us government to 
reconsider the agent orange health claims of more than 31000 
veterans because existing rules sharply tipped the scales 
against those exposed to the toxic defoliant 
us district judge thelton henderson struck down the department 
of veterans affairs regulations that denied agent orange 
servicerelated benefits for cancers and all other diseases except 
one nonfatal skin condition 
in a ruling on a nationwide lawsuit brought on behalf of agent 
orange claimants henderson said the department was wrong to 
require direct proof that the dioxincontaining herbicide caused 
various diseases 
the department formerly known as the veterans administration 
should give claimants the benefit of the doubt he said 
veterans advocates praised the decision which was made public 
monday 
this is a major victory with farreaching implications said 
mary sout president of vietnam veterans of america 
the ruling validates what vietnam veterans have been saying 
for years that the va has failed to give agent orange victims a 
fair hearing i am optimistic that congress will now act 
quickly to resolve this most painful legacy of the vietnam war 
vietnam veterans of america again will sponsor legislation to 
require agent orange benefits for two types of cancer softtissue 
sarcoma and nonhodgkins lymphoma and establish a new 
independent scientific panel to study the herbicides health 
effects said barry kasinitz spokesman for the 35000member group 
a similar bill was passed by the senate last year but died in 
the house kasinitz said 
the veterans department was represented by the justice 
department justice spokeswoman amy brown declined to comment on 
the ruling saying department lawyers had not seen it 
the united states used agent orange to defoliate forests in 
vietnam its health effects are sharply disputed 
in 1985 the va ruled that only a nonfatal skin malady 
chloracne could be considered an effect of exposure to the 
herbicide the agency based its ruling on a review of studies of 
agent oranges effects by an 11member scientific committee 
henderson rejected an attempt by the veterans group to 
challenge the scientific panels review but he said the standards 
the va used in making its rules violated a 1984 federal law 
designed to help vietnam veterans get health benefits 
the va improperly required proof of a causeandeffect 
relationship between the herbicide and a disease for which benefits 
were sought the judge said instead the agency should have 
required only that statistics show a significant correlation 
between dioxin exposure and a disease or an increased risk of 
incidence he said 
the federal law does not spell out the proper standard but 
members of congress who helped pass the law indicated they opposed 
an overly stringent standard and felt that causeandeffect proof 
was unnecessary henderson said the laws remedial purpose 
also favors a lenient standard he said 
the judge noted that the va had relied on statistical 
relationships without requiring proof of causation in granting 
benefits to veterans who were amputees and developed heart disease 
congress did the same thing in granting benefits to former 
prisoners of war who suffered various diseases henderson said 
he also said the va erred by refusing to apply to its agent 
orange regulations the same benefit of the doubt policy it used 
to review individual benefit cases which favors the veteran in 
close questions 
these errors especially sharply compounded with one another 
sharply tipped the scales against veteran claimants henderson 
said 
hendersons ruling does not require the government to add any 
diseases to the serviceconnected list for agent orange but 
kasinitz said he was encouraged by the performance of veterans 
affairs secretary edward derwinski 
we think that we probably stand a better chance of getting a 
fair review under the current administration than we did under the 
past one kasinitz said

legend has it that thomas jefferson 
used to look down by telescope from his hilltop monticello home and 
watch the construction of the university he designed 
officials of the thomas jefferson memorial foundation 
proprietors of monticello are afraid the third president would not 
look so lovingly on the development the university of virginia has 
planned for the foot of his little mountain 
the proposal an 11 million office complex for four state 
agencies has sparked what daniel p jordan executive director of 
the foundation calls a family squabble between the group and 
jeffersons university 
the complex would not be visible from monticello where 
jefferson lived from his retirement in 1809 to his death in 1826 
only from the highway that winds its way up the heavily wooded 
mountain to the redbrick mansion and its perfectly manicured 
grounds 
but jordan said the ambiance of the roadway is terribly 
important to seeing monticello as it was when jefferson lived 
there more than a halfmillion visitors each year begin their trip 
to the home on that road he said monday 
we are trying to preserve the integrity of the monticello 
entranceway he said you cant understand jefferson unless you 
understand the setting 
the foundation owns about 2000 of the 5000 acres that once 
comprised jeffersons estate the university owns land to about 
halfway up the mountain including the 20acre site of the proposed 
development jordan said the foundation always assumed that land 
was safe from encroachment 
we never thought theyd want to do this jordan said it 
was a surprise and a shock 
the university plans to deed the land to the state forestry 
department which would then return to the school its current 
smaller quarters located in the middle of campus 
the foundation has objected to the plan and is awaiting a 
written proposal of possible alternatives from the university 
those alternatives include flipping the blueprint of the 
development so that it faces away from the access to monticello 
onto a different road 
but jordan said the foundation would prefer no development he 
would like to see the road become a protected parkway like the 
mount vernon parkway that leads eight miles from alexandria to 
george washingtons home the road to monticello is only 1 miles 
long and the foundation already owns much of it jordan said 
william fishback associate vice president for university 
relations would not speculate on whether the school might be 
willing to give up the site saying negotiations with the 
foundation are still in the workingout stage 
some other site may or may not be acceptable he said the 
site that were discussing is a preferable site to us 
jordan and fishback said they are optimistic the situation will 
be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties who have always 
been close 
we hope that it will be resolved within the family nobody 
wants a public furor jordan said 
but jordan said the proposal has made the foundation aware of 
the threat of development on other privately owned land near 
monticello 
this issue has opened our eyes to the larger need of 
protecting the setting he said we are the stewards of a 
finite resource

gen manuel antonio noriega 
apparently allowed international observers to monitor panamas 
presidential elections because he was sure his man would win 
former president jimmy carter said 
he didnt have a clue that his man might lose carter told a 
news conference monday night 
carter who said he met with noriega on saturday was made to 
feel unwelcome after he accused panamas de facto leader of 
stealing sundays election from opposition candidate guillermo 
endara 
government candidate carlos duque denounced what he called 
obvious american intervention in affairs that only concern panama 
and the abuse by observers of panamanian hospitality 
duque also was referring to a delegation of observers sent by 
president bush that concluded noriegas soldiers intimidated voters 
and carried out widespread fraud 
the delegation cannot certify that the election was a free and 
fair election said delegation chairman rep john murtha dpa 
carter said he discovered proof of fraud when he examined vote 
tallies being tabulated at the election center he confronted 
election officials and his relationship with the government 
quickly deteriorated he said 
the georgian was forced to hold his news conference in a narrow 
lobby of the marriott hotel because he was denied use of the nearby 
government press center a crowd of noriega supporters stood 
outside and jeered 
carter said the military had seized thousands of vote tally 
sheets in a nighttime sweep 
during the day those records have been discarded and 
counterfeit documents have been substituted he said 
its a military dictatorship rejecting the election it 
condoned and set up carter said 
both murtha and carter cited a roman catholic church exit poll 
that gave endara a 31 margin over duque as evidence of a sweeping 
opposition win 
the panamanian committee for human rights which invited 279 
observers from 21 nations also condemned the election as 
fraudulent 
the bush delegation steered away from policy questions saying 
it would have to consult congress and the white house first 
however sen bob graham dfla an observer who left early 
monday said the united states should now consider the use of 
force in panama 
weve tried economic sanctions which have had almost no 
effect on noriega graham said 
carter disagreed saying he didnt think the international 
community ought to isolate panama 
he said the treaties that bind the united states to turn over 
the panama canal should on no account be violated 
the question he said was how do we exert proper influence 
without punishing innocent people 
i hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator 
stealing this election from his own people carter said 
at the white house delegations news conference former us 
ambassador to panama jack hood vaughn said washington should soon 
be united on a plan to oust noriega 
if i was to talk with manuel id say watch yourself 
vaughn said

the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged 
tuesday while the us dollar ended higher against the japanese yen 
despite reported dollarselling intervention by the bank of japan 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues finished at 
3403187 losing 10337 points or 030 percent the index had 
gained 18025 points for a 3413524point record closing on monday 
the dollar ended at 13500 yen up 048 yen from the previous 
days 13452yen finish the currency opened at 13495 yen and 
ranged between 13490 yen and 13505 yen 
traders said the bank of japan intervened in the market at about 
the 13490yen level and sold about 200 million 
right now the dollar is not rising further however thats 
not because of the central bank intervention but because of 
dollarselling by speculative investors near the 135yen level 
said takamasa yamasaki a dealer with daiwa bank in tokyo 
the bank of japan intervention this morning was successful in 
smoothing trading but it wouldnt help lower the current level of 
the dollar he added 
although the central bank intervention would not reverse the 
dollars trend participants were unlikely to continue buying the 
dollar to raise it beyond the 135yen level he said 
meanwhile japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama told a news 
conference early tuesday the current yendollar exchange rate level 
was not much to worry about 
we should wait to see what happens he said 
on the stock exchange the markets main index erased its 
marginal gain in early trading and plunged mainly due to the 
dollars hike against the yen said an analyst with nomura 
securities in tokyo speaking anonymously 
the index started to fall as electric power issues plunged due 
to the yens weak performance the analyst added 
other dealers said profittaking selling after gains on seven 
consecutive trading days also caused the nikkeis decline

a pygmy singing troupe that had never been but a 
few miles from their village in northern zaire is entertaining 
american audiences in their first performances before anyone but 
their own people 
they came at the risk of being exploited as spectacle of not 
being able to communicate their simplest wants if they got lost 
and of not being able to deal with a first airplane trip that 
lasted for eight hours 
the batwaekonda pygmies are dancing and singing their 
polyphonic music as part of africa oye a 10week us tour by 
52 african performers the tour opened at the boston opera house on 
thursday it is now playing in new york and will travel to 
baltimore washington dc san antonio texas and los angeles 
the pygmies give good early reviews to the venture 
mpata lopoma and botika ekalaka among five pygmies in the 
troupe said so far they have liked the bigcity buildings and all 
the bustle they didnt care much for some of the food especially 
american sandwiches but they liked the rice from chinese 
restaurants danish pastry fried chicken and the breads 
but mostly what they have liked so far are the people 
we like that they like our music said lopoma 
the africans performances in boston often prompted hoots of 
delight rhythmic clapping and standing ovations 
the pygmies and other performers such as the magnificent 
drummers of guinea and the kanouri of niger who through circular 
breathing can play a horn for as long as they like without 
noticeably drawing a breath often responded with smiles and waves 
of mutual appreciation 
other acts include papa wemba one of africas most popular pop 
artists and singer kandia kouyate who is famous throughout africa 
for her lyric voice in which she tells the centuriesold history of 
her mandingue people in song 
the show two years in the making got off to a shaky start the 
troupes trip to boston was delayed in dakar senegal because of 
bloody ethnic riots and the pende mask dancers of northwest zaire 
created a little stir there when feeling uncomfortably cool they 
built a fire outside their hotel 
and ekalaka said the pygmies were a bit unsettled by the long 
flight 
we thought it would fall in the water he said through a 
translator 
but once here they were happy to be making music 
mel howard producer of the show said he had counted on that 
feeling to make the africans feel comfortable he said 
modernization and the influence of missionaries in africa have 
stirred feelings there over the years that much of the indigenous 
music and dance of africa have become outmoded 
ekalaka and lopoma said they were aware of those feelings 
but we love music we sing every day there is a reason to 
sing a marriage funeral any ceremony ekalaka said 
the pygmies were the least spectacular of the acts but there 
was a primeval elegance in their gentle swayings and polyphonic 
singing 
they live in northern zaire and for many years have been 
assimilated into the ekonda people and their music reflects the 
change 
the batwaekonda pygmies differ from more isolated pygmies in 
that they are taller pure pygmies average several inches under 5 
feet in height they draw as much sustenance from farming as 
hunting and they are not nomadic 
whatever happens on the tour ekalaka said africa oye 
already has bolstered their belief that their music and the music 
of other tribes is worth preserving

the reagan administrations attempt to prevent 
federally financed family planning clinics from counseling women 
about abortion was unconstitutional an appeals court said in 
upholding an injunction 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals on monday upheld a 1988 
nationwide injunction blocking the regulations from taking effect 
this is a resounding victory for a womans right to make a 
most personal decision without government interference said 
state attorney general james shannon who sought the injunction 
along with 14 national family planning associations 
these regulations would have prevented health care 
professionals from advising their patients on the basis of sound 
medical judgment he said 
the regulations passed under the reagan administration sought 
to eliminate federal funding to family planning groups that 
counseled women about abortions the rules also sought to force the 
groups to close or relocate if they shared space with anyone 
offering abortion counseling or referrals 
nabers cabaniss director of the title x program at the 
department of health and human services said the agency would have 
no comment until it had studied the ruling title x authorized 
federal financing of private and public family planning services 
in affirming the injunction ordered by us district judge 
walter skinner the appeals court said a prohibition on abortion 
counseling or referral imposes constraints upon a womans freedom 
to make reproductive decisions 
relying on the us supreme courts roe vs wade decision the 
appeals court said that by imposing the regulations thenhealth 
and human services secretary otis r bowen has gone beyond a mere 
refusal to fund and has interfered with the decisional process by 
dictating what information a woman may receive and by intruding 
into her relationship with her physician 
the court also held that prohibiting clinics or doctors form 
advocating or promoting abortion violated first amendment rights to 
free speech 
scott swirling executive director for the washingtonbased 
national family planning and reproductive health association

professionals and family planning clinics 
challenges to the regulations are also pending in appeals courts 
in colorado and new york 
however swirling and shannon said the boston courts decision 
will have a more sweeping impact because swirlings group which 
represents more than 85 percent of the nations federally funded 
family planning clinics was a party to the massachusetts appeal 
doug johnson legislative director with national right to life 
said he was surprised the appeals court acted before the supreme 
court ruled on a recent missouri challenge to the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision legalizing abortion 
the two cases raise similar constitutional questions surrounding 
the abortion issue he said adding it is quite possible that 
the supreme courts ruling will require the circuit to revisit 
the issue

the tokyo stock exchanges key index fell today 
after climbing for six trading days while the dollar hit an 
eightmonth high against the yen despite central bank intervention 
market sources said 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 10337 points or 030 
percent closing at 3403187 the index had gained 18025 points 
for a 3413524point record closing on monday 
a nomura securities dealer speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the indexs fall resulted mainly from profittaking selling 
following continuous gains since april 26 
uncertainties over the foreign exchange rate also discouraged 
japanese investors buying interest he said 
he said the dollars rise to the 140yen level might lead to an 
interest rate hike which would further discourage stock buying 
an interest rate hike is unlikely if you consider only the 
recent rate of growth in the japanese economy but it is very 
likely if the dollar rises further reaching the 140yen level for 
instance the dealer added 
trading was rather active dominated by sell orders with first 
section volume estimated at 11 billion shares 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 13500 yen up 048 
yen from mondays 13452yen close and its highest close since 
13560 yen last sept 6 
the dollar now has gained 383 yen since april 25 
it opened today at 13495 yen when it reached its high for the 
day of 13505 yen in early trading the bank of japan sold dollars 
to check the rise said minori takeuchi a dealer at chemical bank 
the central bank which does not comment on its market 
intervention also was reported to have sold dollars on monday 
ms takeuchi said the bank sold about 100 million today the 
dollar however went no lower than 13490 yen during the day 
daiwa bank dealer takamasa yamasaki said speculative investors 
also sold dollars near the 135yen level 
ms takeuchi said trading was thin especially in the afternoon 
following the central bank intervention 
finance minister tatsuo murayama told a news conference the 
current yendollar exchange rate isnt that much of a concern we

opposition leader neil kinnock has called for 
scrapping his labor partys votelosing policy of unilateral 
nuclear disarmament as well as the naive shoppinglist 
socialism of party leftwingers 
at the start of a twoday meeting of labors national executive 
committee kinnock on monday accused leftwingers of trying to 
dissociate the party completely from the capitalist market economy 
system 
its the system we live in and we have got to make it work 
more efficiently more fairly and more successfully in the world 
market place kinnock told a news conference 
thats what the policy review report is about and we shall 
reject any sort of naive shoppinglist socialism he said 
labor which has lost three elections in a row since 1979 and 
has lurched further left in opposition is midway through a 
twoyear review of its policies the next general election will 
probably be held in 1991 
kinnock and other party leaders want to water down the 
unequivocal policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament which has 
undermined the partys chances of regaining support the committee 
was expected to vote on that policy today 
the policy would commit a labor government to scrap britains 
nuclear weapons unilaterally and shut down us nuclear bases in 
this country within five years 
on monday the committee voted by 234 in favor of a 
kinnockbacked policy to jettison commitments to renationalize all 
stateowned industries sold by prime minister margaret thatcher 
the policy favors renationalizing only the telephone and 
telecommunications giant british telecom and the english and welsh 
water supply system which is due to be sold within a year 
the committee also voted in favor of raising income tax for 
highearners to 50 percent from the current 40 percent limit a 
labor government also would build no more new nuclear power 
stations the committee agreed 
on the economy kinnock has already succeeded in edging his 
party to the right and denied that a labor government would be 
profligate 
labor he said would not promise to spend that which we have 
not got we will make stark decisions about priorities 
leftwingers such as former cabinet minister tony benn have 
accused kinnock of trying to dilute labors leftwing doctrines and 
simply copy mrs thatchers conservatives 
these policies are asking the electorate to disregard our 
campaigns in the last two general elections benn said

a parade of chemists presented evidence 
suggesting they created a nuclear fusion reaction in a jar at room 
temperature but they failed to convince critics who contend the 
findings are delusion 
there is no fusion in university of utah experiments by 
chemists b stanley pons and martin fleischmann said their most 
vocal critic california institute of technology chemist nathan 
lewis 
i dont think anything has been proved its going to take 
time to sort it out ralph brodd former president of the 
electrochemical society inc said after fleischmann and pons spoke 
to 1800 scientists attending the groups monday night meeting 
last week university of utah vice president james brophy had 
promised that pons and fleischmann would present new evidence at 
the meeting however the only significantly new information they 
offered was a report that their latest experiments produced even 
more excess heat than their earlier one 
fleischmann and pons acknowledged some problems in their 
research but said they still believed they achieved fusion in a 
jar 
i have always been ready to acknowledge the fact our 
experiments could be faulty fleischmann of englands university 
of southampton told reporters if we turn out to be wrong ill 
be the first to admit it 
fleischmann and pons of the university of utah disputed lewis 
and others who accused them of sloppy measurements pons said 
scientists who have been unable to duplicate their experiments 
failed to use large enough electrodes made of the metal palladium 
the two chemists shocked the world march 23 when they announced 
they created fusion by sending electrical current through a device 
in which an electrode of palladium metal was wrapped in platinum 
and soaked in heavy water heavy water is made from oxygen and a 
form of hydrogen called deuterium 
such an accomplishment if confirmed could lead to a cheap and 
virtually inexhaustible source of energy previous fusion research 
focused on multimilliondollar efforts to create fusion under 
extreme pressures and high temperatures 
pons and fleischmann said monday their latest experiment 
produced 10 to 50 times more energy with their device than the 
amount they put into it the energy was emitted as a burst of heat 
that lasted two days they said in their initial announcement 
they said they had produced four times more energy than was used 
several other scientists also said they successfully produced 
excess heat or other signs of fusion such as neutrons but stopped 
short of saying their studies proved fusion had happened 
something real is happening here said stanford universitys 
robert huggins noting that he got 40 percent more heat from his 
experiment than he put into it 
we do see neutrons clearly this is a clear signature for 
fusion but at a very low level said physicist steven jones of 
brigham young university 
jones said that he conducted his experiments with proper 
scientific controls he said an editorial in the british journal 
nature suggesting otherwise was just a mistake by the editor a 
diatribe 
lewis repeated the attack he launched against pons and 
fleischmann during last weeks meeting of the american physical 
society in baltimore 
he disputed their claims that their device produced excess heat 
or that it yielded byproducts of fusion including helium tritium 
neutrons and gamma rays 
lewis said his own experiments showed the helium comes from 
laboratory air the tritium evolved from water in the experiment 
and the nature of the gamma rays was such that they couldnt 
possibly have come from fusion 
fleischmann acknowledged the gammaray evidence was the least 
satisfactory part of their research we are doing a complete 
new set of measurements with improved techniques he said 
however he said his excess heat measurements were accurate not 
the result of measuring only hot spots in the fusion device he 
showed a short movie of gas bubbling through the fusion device to 
support his claim heat was distributed evenly inside the apparatus 
john bockris of texas aampm university said 14 laboratories in 
six nations have done cold fusion experiments that produced excess 
heat as well as some form of radioactive emission indicating fusion 
but he said the failure of many other labs to replicate the utah 
experiment may occur because of variations in the amount of 
hydrogen in palladium electrodes hydrogen may act as a poison 
to prevent fusion of deuterium bockris said

six rodeo bulls and two cows escaped from 
an overturned truck and charged a california highway patrolman and 
several cars during a nearly 10hour rampage before authorities 
shot them 
they charged anything that moved highway patrol spokesman 
jim gregg said 
the animals ran loose after a trailer tipped over early monday 
near this central california town one other bull was killed in the 
crash 
owner frank pires of strathmore asked authorities to kill them 
instead of trying to round them up gregg said the bulls which 
were being driven home from the riverdale rodeo grounds were 
valued at 1500 to 2000 each 
we were advised by the owner that they definitely were not 
friendly they were very aggressive stock gregg said the 
owner said dont try to take them alive because somebody is going 
to get hurt just eliminate them 
authorities closed the highway and diverted traffic while animal 
control officers stalked the animals in the darkness with 
highpowered rifles 
one bull chased a patrolman onto the hood of his car gregg 
said others charged cars no injuries were reported though and 
the last of the animals was destroyed 9 hours after the accident 
there was some real hazard if we didnt get them eliminated 
gregg said its very unfortunate but its one of those things

a 15yearold boy accidentally killed his 
father when a wounded 300pound black bear attacked the father and 
the son tried to shoot the animal authorities said 
darrell holman 37 and his son ben of nearby model were bear 
hunting saturday when the accident occurred the son shot his 
father as the black bear began mauling his father las animas 
county sheriff lou girodo said monday 
the father was dead of a gunshot wound to the chest when 
deputies reached him on a mountainside near aguilar about 200 
miles south of denver 
the bear was found dead by state division of wildlife officials 
about a mile from where holman was killed holmans death was the 
first hunting fatality in colorado since november 1987 
that was a big bear for this country said girodo adding 
that las animas county has a large black bear population and is a 
popular bearhunting area you consider that a bear that size has 
the strength of 10 men 
the sheriff said darrell holman shot the bear with rifle when 
the bear went for a bait of garbage but the bear fled 
girodo said the holmans tracked the animal and spotted the bear 
near the crest of the mountain when they saw the bear fall to the 
ground the holmans approached it the bear got up and ran straight 
for them girodo said 
the bear approached the father and he shot it two more times 
but it did not stop the bear the sheriff said the bear pushed 
the father against a rock and went at him as though he were going 
to maul and chew him 
ben holman then fired at the bear at close range but hit his 
father said girodo 
the shot scared off the bear and the son ran down the mountain 
to a car where his mother and sister were waiting for them and he 
drove the car to a ranch to notify authorities the sheriff said

special advertising campaigns will be 
directed toward blacks hispanics and asians in an effort to ensure 
minorities are not underrepresented in the 1990 census 
c louis kincannon deputy director of the census bureau said 
monday that undercounting is a problem today as it was 200 years 
ago during the first census 
he and other federal officials joined gov william donald 
schaefer in kicking off a national publicity campaign for the 
census next year and urged americans to stand up and be counted 
this town of about 3100 people on marylands eastern shore was 
picked for the celebration because in 1790 it was the young 
american nations population hub about the same number of people 
lived north south east and west of chestertown 
the days main event was a parade down chestertowns treelined 
streets commemorating american history from 1790 
the parade featured old trains and cars a covered wagon and a 
rocket a makebelieve george washington state comptroller louis 
l goldstein in a burgundy period costume and an astronaut air 
force col loren j shriver who served as grand marshal 
in 1790 thomas jefferson and washington were hoping the census 
would show there were more than 4 million people they were 
disappointed when the count came in at 39 million according to 
the census bureaus raymond bancroft 
undercounting was a problem 200 years ago that persists today 
he said 
the two american leaders wanted a larger population to show 
england we were a big country bancroft said but there are more 
practical reasons today for making sure everyone is counted he 
said 
kincannon said a great deal is at stake in the census including 
about 35 billion a year in federal aid distributed to state and 
local governments according to population 
census statistics also determine the makeup of elected 
legislative bodies from the us house of representatives to city 
councils 
kincannon estimated that about 99 percent of the people who live 
in the united states were counted in the 1980 census 
regional census director laverne collins said she hopes people 
realize census information is confidential illegal aliens are not 
reported to immigration officials and income levels are not turned 
over to the internal revenue service she said 
the 1990 census will cost about 26 billion during a 10year 
period and about 500000 people will be employed at the peak 
counting ms collins said

the afghan armed forces are digging in 
in the southern city of kandahar where they expect a major attack 
by moslem guerrillas this week government sources said today 
the city is considered more vulnerable than the eastern city of 
jalalabad where a nineweek siege by the insurgents has failed to 
dislodge government fighters 
the guerrillas have been trying to capture an afghan city for a 
base for the socalled governmentinexile they set up in pakistan 
in february 
the attack on kandahar is expected at the end of eid alfitr 
the threeday feast marking the end of the islamic holy month of 
ramadan according to the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the eid ended monday night in afghanistan but concludes today in 
neighboring pakistan because of different interpretations of the 
lunar calendar pakistan is the base of the guerrillas who have 
been trying for 11 years to oust the prosoviet afghan government 
of president najib 
najib has accused pakistan of deploying about 15000 soldiers 
across the border near quetta to help in an attack on kandahar 
which is about 200 miles from kabul the capital 
on monday the afghan un mission in new york accused pakistan 
of supplying soldiers for a new assault on jalalabad 
pakistan supplies the rebels along with countries including the 
united states but it has repeatedly denied afghan government 
claims that it trains the guerrillas or has dispatched troops to 
afghanistan 
soviet ground forces commander gen valentine varennikov toured 
kandahar last week to inspect the citys defenses his fourday 
visit was primarily for consultations with najib and senior afghan 
army commanders a senior soviet official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
it was an important visit an inspection tour to see how well 
the army is prepared for fighting the official said 
he said varennikov was satisfied with the governments 
planning 
the soviet union ended nine years of intervention in afghanistan 
when it withdrew the last of its troops on feb 15 it continues to 
supply weapons and ammunition to najibs forces who have 
successfully held jalalabad during a guerrilla siege now in its 
ninth week 
kandahar located on a plain about 60 miles from the pakistani 
border and 120 miles from quetta is considered more vulnerable to 
attack than jalalabad the guerrillas have intermittently besieged 
kandahar for more than a year 
before the civil war began a decade ago kandahar was 
afghanistans secondlargest city after kabul tens of thousands of 
people have fled kandahar however and government officials say 
they dont know how many remain 
kandahar and the surrounding province is the home of the durrani 
tribe from which the nations royal family came many people in the 
area remain staunchly loyal to former king zahir shah who was 
overthrown in 1973 
najib also has blood ties to the durrani whose independence and 
fighting skills are legendary in afghanistan 
the guerrillas control much of the countryside in kandahar 
province and elsewhere in afghanistan but have never captured a 
major city a victory could give them the psychological momentum 
for an attack on kabul

television and radio newscasts by the british 
broadcasting corp were severely disrupted today as thousands of 
news and production employees began a 48hour strike for higher pay 
the national union of journalists said in a statement shortly 
before the walkout began at midnight monday that bbc management 
faced a long hot summer of worker unrest unless it increased 
its pay offer 
the union predicted that more than half of the bbcs 25000 
employees would join the strike 
among programs affected was bbc radios flagship news and 
current affairs program today prime minister margaret thatcher 
says she listens to it every morning 
today normally runs from 630 am to 835 am today it 
was cut to news bulletins of two to five minutes every half hour 
one bulletin reported details of the strike and said the unions 
are demanding a 16 percent pay increase while the bbc is offering 7 
percent 
the bbc broadcast recorded current affairs features to fill the 
time between news bulletins 
tenminute news bulletins broadcast each hour on the bbcs 
english language world service were cut to two minutes the 24hour 
service claims a worldwide audience of 120 million 
the strike followed a 24hour walkout on april 24 the first at 
the bbc since 1985 
the strikers are demanding that their pay be brought in line 
with commercial broadcasting salaries the unions say the national 
average pay for a bbc journalist is about 28400 a year compared 
with 40000 in commercial radio and television 
the bbcs domestic tv and radio services are funded by a licence 
fee paid by people who own tv sets the government sets the fee 
each year and the bbc says it cannot afford pay increases of more 
than 7 percent 
the annual fee for a blackandwhite set is about 42 and for a 
color set 110 the bbc says the fee has not risen in line with 
inflation currently running at 79 percent and expected to 
increase and has left the corporation short of money 
the bbc world service is funded by a government grant

orlando 
i think its so wrong said frankie skinner 23 of orlando 
they shouldnt get another chance 
local officials raised another possible objection monday 
announcing that the bakkers had not applied for an occupational 
license to operate their headquarters from the shopping center and 
ordering building inspectors to visit the shopping center today 
yet bakker said before the program that he was satisfied with 
the move to the shoppers world mall which is located outside 
orlando 
orlando seems like its the crossroads of the world bakker 
told reporters the thing i like about it is its a place where 
it seems like everyone is welcome 
the only other tenants at the 90000squarefoot strip mall are 
a far east import store and two bars including nasty eds pub 
where the clientele squinted through windows to see their new 
neighbors 
the bakkers came to florida after running into zoning problems 
while taping their program at a rented home near charlotte nc 
bakker 49 is awaiting a federal trial on 24 counts of fraud 
and conspiracy the former head of the ptl television ministry is 
charged with stealing millions of dollars from the organization he 
founded 
bakker was ousted in 1987 following revelations that he had a 
sexual tryst with church secretary jessica hahn and paid her with

night stalker defendant richard ramirez 
snarled at reporters covering his serial murder trial calling them 
sensationseeking parasites 
mondays outburst came after he emerged from a conference in the 
chambers of superior court judge michael tynan about whether 
defense lawyers would present evidence in his behalf the 
prosecution already has rested its case 
tynan gave ramirez lawyers an extra day to decide whether to 
call witnesses or rest their case without presenting evidence 
the tall shaggyhaired ramirez had made no public statements 
since he said hail satan and flashed a pentagram drawn on his 
palm at his arraignment nearly four years ago 
as ramirez was being led back to his holding cell with shackles 
rattling around his ankles he turned toward the courtroom 
spectator section where reporters were taking notes 
media he growled in a loud gravelly voice 
sensationseeking parasites 
the 29yearold drifter from el paso texas is charged with 13 
murders and 30 related felonies in los angeles county during a 
series of nighttime attacks that terrified the state in the summer 
of 1985 
authorities said pentagrams upsidedown fivepointed stars in 
circles used to symbolize satan were found at some murder scenes 
one victims eyes were gouged out a woman testified that her 
attacker raped and sodomized her and made her swear to satan as 
she lay beside her slain husband 
ramirez was arrested on labor day weekend 1985 after a mob 
recognized him ran him down and beat him as he tried to steal a 
car authorities said 
since testimony began in his trial jan 30 six survivors of 
night stalker attacks have identified ramirez as their 
assailant a total of 138 witnesses have testified against him 
ramirezs lawyers had said he was emotionally distraught last 
week and wanted no defense because he felt it would do no good 
were still talking to our client there are many things we 
have to consider overnight defense attorney daniel hernandez

the leaders of australias two main 
opposition parties were simultaneously dumped today in party room 
coups that could reshape the countrys conservative political camp 
the backroom maneuvering changed the leadership of the liberal 
and national parties which in coalition dominated australias 
postwar government until prime minister bob hawkes labor party won 
parliamentary elections in 1983 
the liberal party restored its old leader andrew peacock in 
place of john howard and the nationals the junior opposition 
partner deposing ian sinclair for charles blunt 
the people who mounted the coups smell the scent of 
government said michelle gratton respected political 
commentator for the age newspaper in melbourne they are 
embarking on a ruthless exercise to try to ensure that the 
opportunity of the next election is not lost 
the change had been brewing since the last federal election in 
july 1987 that gave hawkes government a record third straight 
victory with 86 seats in the 148 seat house of representatives 
howard as opposition coalition leader had been widely viewed 
as bungling the coalitions chances of victory after miscalculating 
in a tax reform proposal 
ballots for the new positions were called unexpectedly monday 
night and howard was clearly surprised by the challenge 
as he entered the federal parliament today howard declared that 
his political career was not in jeopardy i have the numbers i 
will not resign 
peacock a former foreign minister led the liberals when they 
lost the 1983 election howard ousted peacock as party leader in 
1985 and on tuesday peacock got his old job back winning the 
ballot by 44 votes to 27 
perhaps more significant was sinclairs ousting as national 
party leader the position had never before been challenged 
unlike peacocks wellorchestrated effort blunts run for the 
national crown was sudden several others entered the fray but he 
received the numbers blunt had been the partys aviation and 
transport minister the national party vote was kept secret 
in coalition the liberals and nationals have governed australia 
for most of the past 40 years barring the last six under hawkes 
centrist labor government hawke is regarded as the countrys most 
popular leader ever but his party which has embarked on radical 
economic reform is not 
peacock and howard are both 50 but howard has often been 
ridiculed by labor politicians as tired old john peacock is 
known as the father of the liberal party having entered the 
political arena in 1966 
sinclair the ousted national leader is 59 his successor 
blunt is 38 
but hawke in his only comment on todays opposition 
maneuvering told labor stalwarts that he does not intend to call 
early elections the next federal balloting is scheduled for may 
1990 
under howard the liberal party had undergone a marked shift to 
the right and public opinion polls had consistently shown the 
liberalnational coalition under howard as being unlikely to 
successfully contest a federal election

a protective iron cage with three heavy locks has been built 
around the statue at venice high school to prevent another attack 
the most recent damage was discovered in february 
its the imprisonment of myrna said the 66yearold artist 
who lives in venice and has restored the statue after each attack 
something is wrong with society when we find ourselves locking up 
our art to preserve it 
we used to put only criminals behind bars now we live behind 
bars the statue is a symbol of the school and you know the bars 
are a symbol to what we have become 
principal andrea natker said the cage was the only way to 
protect the 7foottall statue originally sculpted in the 1920s by 
former venice high art teacher harry winebrenner 
the 1500 for the iron cage was donated by new york producers 
of a planned musical based on the lighthearted mystery film the 
thin man starring miss loy and william powell

a book explaining how to hide a person has 
been found in the home of a couple suspected in the deaths of their 
baby daughters in similar circumstances three years apart 
authorities say 
the stash book was among the items taken by police from the 
alton home of robert and paula sims according to documents filed 
monday in madison county circuit court 
the simses 6weekold daughter heather lee was found dead of 
suffocation wednesday night in a trash can on the missouri side of 
the mississippi river four days after the couple reported her 
abducted 
the couple also had reported their first daughter 13dayold 
loralei was abducted on june 17 1986 authorities said the 
remains of a baby believed to be loralei were found a week later 
near the couples home then in nearby brighton just to the 
northeast of st louis 
in both cases mrs sims said her daughter was kidnapped by an 
armed masked gunman while her husband was at work authorities 
said the case of loralei sims was never solved although the 
simses remain suspects jersey county sheriff frank yocom said 
sgt rick mccain chief of detectives in alton said the seized 
book dealt with hiding different kinds of items and included one 
section on hiding a person he said the section explained how to 
build a false wall that someone could live behind in a home 
asked how the book might relate to the case mccain said 
because the body might have been hidden 
police have said tests showed heathers body had been frozen 
before it was dumped investigators said they found hairs in the 
bottom of the freezer at the home of mrs sims parents orville 
and nylene blew of cottage hills 
police in alton asked the simses again monday for more 
information about the deaths but the simses declined police said 
if they have a story to tell were here to listen mccain 
said i think ive made it fairly clear that we want to talk to 
them if not well go on with our case as it is 
on monday the couples attorney told police the simses would 
not submit to polygraph tests mccain said but he said he believed 
heathers killing would be solved even if the simses dont provide 
more information 
mccain said robert sims told police last week he doubted his 
wifes stories about the abductions the 37yearold sims told 
police he believed his wife might have killed their daughters 
accidentally mccain said 
mrs sims had been upset at not having had boys after she gave 
birth to both her daughters the officer said 
paula sims 29 has declined to talk with police 
the state took custody of the couples 15monthold son randy 
on friday 
the simses met for about an hour monday with their attorney 
donald e groshong the couple declined to comment afterward and 
groshong said much of what police have said isnt even worth 
commenting on

japan has formally asked the united states to 
explain a 1965 accident in which a us carrier lost a hydrogen 
bomb in the pacific near a japanese island while bound for a 
japanese port officials said tuesday 
this happened in international waters so we have no right to 
make a loud demand said a senior foreign ministry official who 
declined to be named we are just asking the united states to 
give us an explanation 
japanese opposition politicians and citizens groups claim the 
us government covered up the accident japan is the only country 
ever attacked with nuclear weapons and popular sentiment is 
strongly against nuclear arms 
the bomb was aboard an a4 skyhawk jet that fell off the carrier 
ticonderoga about 80 miles from a small island in japans ryukyu 
chain and 200 miles east of the heavily populated island of 
okinawa a us military spokesman in japan said 
the carrier was on its way from vietnam to the japanese port of 
yokosuka and the planes pilot was killed in the accident 
after a report in the current issue of newsweek magazine raised 
the issue japan asked monday for a us explanation 
we are interested and concerned about the details the 
foreign ministry official said 
other officials said japans government does not know the 
location and condition of the b43 bomb and there had been no 
discussions with the united states about how to deal with it 
the magazine report quoting nuclear expert william arkin of the 
washingtonbased institute for policy studies said the us navy 
kept the incident secret until a 1981 pentagon report that listed 
accidents involving nuclear weapons 
but at the time of the 1981 report the united states did not 
bring it to our attention said the foreign ministry official 
the report said only that the accident occurred 500 miles from the 
asian mainland 
arkin said there was scant danger the bomb would detonate 
although the 33 pounds of plutonium in the bomb could threaten the 
environment as it deteriorates 
the ticonderoga was on a mission that included readiness to 
launch a nuclear strike a declassified us navy document released 
by arkin and the environmental group greenpeace said 
the disclosure raised the possibility that the carrier entered 
yokosuka with nuclear arms despite japans ban on nuclear weapons 
there is no doubt in my mind that us ships still transit 
japan with nuclear weapons aboard arkin said in washington on 
monday 
the navy declined comment on arkins findings 
opposition parties and citizens have charged that navy ships 
routinely visit japanese ports carrying nuclear bombs with the 
tacit agreement of the japanese government 
japan has said the united states is not permitted to bring in 
nuclear weapons without prior consultations and there have been no 
such consulations 
the united states refuses to confirm or deny the presence of 
nuclear weapons in specific locations 
the lost onemegaton hydrogen bomb was about 70 times as 
powerful as the bomb that fell on the port city of hiroshima in 
august 1945 in the closing days of world war ii kyodo news service 
reported 
disclosure of the 1965 accident has stirred the ire of citizens 
on okinawa the site of one of the bloodiest battles in world war 
ii and the continued presence of some 35000 us troops has led 
to tensions and frequent protests over such problems as target 
range accidents 
leaders of okinawan citizens groups protesting nuclear arms 
denounced the way the incident has been handled news reports said

former gov edwin edwards who dominated 
louisiana politics for nearly two decades but was dogged by 
racketeering charges in his last term said he will run for an 
unprecedented fourth term in 1991 
his announcement monday came little more than one week after 
voters defeated gov buddy roemers tax revision package which 
some political analysts called a referendum on the governors 
political strength 
i can tell you that buddy roemer will not be the next 
governor so i decided to make the run said edwards 61 looking 
fit and tanned during a brief visit to the capitol 
jeff cowart a spokesman for roemer said we normally dont 
respond to edwins fantasies 
edwards ran second to roemer in the 1987 primary and then 
dropped out of a runoff 
edwards served two fouryear terms in the 1970s and was barred 
by the constitution from seeking a third consecutive term 
in 1983 he became the first governor elected three times by 
defeating dave treen the states first republican governor since 
reconstruction 
that term was marked by edwards trial and acquittal on federal 
racketeering charges and the collapse of oil prices that threw the 
state into a deep recession 
edwards said he would establish a campaign office in about a 
year he promised to revive his 1987 campaign theme creation of 
a state lottery and casino gambling for new orleans 
roemer opposed the lottery and new taxes and vowed to reduce the 
budget 
nearly two dozen lottery bills have been filed in the 
legislature as lawmakers look for new revenue to meet a projected 
700 million deficit for the fiscal year that starts july 1 
a lottery and casino gambling are the only answers in these 
economic times there are some longrange things that can be done 
but the state needs something sooner and not taxes on the backs of 
the people edwards said 
he said roemer doomed himself by making irresponsible campaign 
promises inconsistent with reality and now he must retreat he 
admits he cant solve all of the problems by scrubbing the budget 
in his first year in office roemer pushed through sales tax 
increases and borrowed 1 billion to retire an accumulated deficit 
his tax package which was rejected by 55 percent to 45 percent 
would have reduced business taxes and sales taxes and increased 
individual income taxes roemer said the package was necessary to 
create jobs and reduce the states dependence on the oil industry

us naval vessels are transporting nuclear 
weapons across japanese territorial waters even though japan 
forbids introduction of such loads a researcher says 
there is no doubt in my mind that us ships still transit 
japan with nuclear weapons aboard researcher william arkin of 
the liberal institute for policy studies said monday in an 
interview 
arkin made the comment after releasing evidence about a 1965 
accident in which the navy lost a bombbearing aircraft and its 
pilot 80 miles off japans okinawa island chain 
japan on monday formally requested an explanation from 
washington about the 1965 accident 
this happened in international waters so we have no right to 
make a loud demand said a senior foreign ministry official who 
declined to be named we are just asking the united states to 
give us an explanation 
the research arkin did with the environmentalist greenpeace 
group concluded that the united states and soviet union have 
littered the ocean floor with at least 48 nuclear weapons and 11 
nuclear reactors 
two days after the airplane fell off the elevator of the uss 
ticonderoga the aircraft carrier docked at the japanese port of 
yokosuka arkin said 
arkin asserted monday the united states sidesteps the japanese 
ban by arguing a temporary transit or port call by a ship does not 
amount to the introduction of nuclear weapons 
a japanese embassy official in washington said monday on 
condition of anonymity it is our understanding that we would 
receive prior consultation with the united states before us 
forces bring nuclear weapons to japan so if there has been no 
consultation we assume there has been no introduction of nuclear 
weapons 
the navy declined comment on the findings saying it refuses to 
confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons in specific 
locations 
arkin and joshua handler a greenpeace member who helped prepare 
the report said their research showed a different version of 
events from the one given by the navy in 1981 when it disclosed the 
incident 
the navy said in a statement then that the incident took place 
more than 500 miles from land at sea in the pacific 
arkin and handler said log books kept by deck officers showed 
that the accident occurred in international waters about 80 miles 
from the closest point of the okinawa island chain and only about 
200 miles east of the heavily populated island of okinawa 
the accident is considered by the navy to be one of its two most 
severe mishaps involving nuclear devices the second such broken 
arrow as the incidents are called was the 1968 loss of the 
submarine scorpion in the atlantic 
at the time of the ticonderoga accident okinawa was under us 
control it was returned to japan in 1972 27 years after japans 
defeat in world war ii in which atomic bombs were dropped on 
hiroshima and nagasaki 
the ship had been returning from bombing missions off the coast 
of vietnam although only conventional bombs were used in vietnam 
a newly declassified memo obtained by arkin said the ticonderoga at 
the time was to have the capability to launch a nuclear strike 
when and where directed by the president 
arkin said there was little danger of detonation from the 
onemegaton bomb which has a force of one million tons of tnt 
although he said the 15 kilograms of plutonium in the bomb could 
threaten the environment as it deteriorates over time 
over time the pressure water circulation and corrosion are 
likely to lead to the release of radioactivity he said 
the japanese government does not know the present location and 
condition of the bomb and there have been no discussions with the 
united states about how to deal with it sai a japanese foreign 
ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
most of the warheads and reactors lost at sea belonged to the 
soviet union according to greenpeace data 
the most recent soviet loss was a mike class submarine with two 
nuclear reactors aboard off the coast of norway that sank april 7 
said handler 
the most serious loss was a soviet yankee class submarine that 
sank oct 6 1986 off the coast of bermuda in the atlantic ocean 
yankeeclass subs are believed to carry 16 ssn6 ballistic 
missiles with two warheads apiece and to be powered by two 
nuclear reactors according to western defense analysts 
the report which first came out over the weekend was 
prominently featured in japanese newspapers and on television 
leaders of antiwar and antinuclear groups and opponents of the 
us military presence on okinawa immediately issued denunciations

communist party leaders have stripped 
former longtime party boss janos kadar of his last posts saying 
the man who took over when the soviets crushed a 1956 popular 
revolt is too ill to carry on 
the 76yearold kadar replaced as hungarys leader last year 
was stripped by the partys governing central committee monday of 
the post of honorary party president and his seat on the committee 
the state news agency mti said kadar was retired on the basis 
of information received about his state of health 
but the action followed disclosure of kadars role in past 
political repressions and increasing public criticism of his 
failure to keep pushing reforms during his 32 years in power 
mti said the central committee addressed a written message 
to kadar indicating he did not attend mondays meeting and that 
its contents would be published later 
kadar had been replaced as party chief by karoly grosz who is 
leading a slow transition to the politics of competing parties and 
who criticized the role kadar played after soviet forces crushed 
the 1956 popular revolt 
kadar who last month was said by officials to be so ill that he 
could not carry out his duties has been seen rarely in public 
since losing the party to grosz last may 
that shift ushered in a time of fastpaced reforms with 
communists who advocate greater democracy gradually gaining 
strength 
such party members have made it clear that they viewed kadars 
removal from all party posts as a step to gaining trust and 
confidence with the public before elections next year the first 
multiparty balloting in four decades 
politburo member mihaly jasso gave the first public hint that 
kadar would be relieved of his last posts when he told a budapest 
newspaper sunday that kadar was very ill but refused to leave 
for treatment at a soviet health spa in the crimea 
kadars role in repressions while interior minister after the 
communist takeover in 1948 and in the bloody end of the antisoviet 
revolt in 1956 have come under increasing public criticism recently 
the government daily magyar hirlap on saturday published a 
fullpage document from july 1956 authored by mihaly farkas the 
no 3 figure in the communist leadership before the revolt that 
year 
the document disclosed that kadar then head of the interior 
ministry approved of the beating of laszlo rajk a leading 
communist accused of treason and executed in a 1949 purge 
at a meeting of top historians last week academician maria 
ormos called for the leadership to make public other documents she 
claims may show kadar had a part in the capture imprisonment and 
execution of imre nagy leader of the shortlived 1956 revolt 
kadars role at the end of the revolt has never been fully 
explained 
as kadars political star waned nagys rose executed in 1958 
and buried with other leaders of the revolt in an anonymous remote 
corner of a budapest cemetery nagy is to be reburied next month in 
a marked grave in the same spot 
tens of thousands of hungarians are expected to attend the 
funeral a new book about nagy and lapel pins with his portrait are 
selling fast at budapest kiosks 
once shunned by the west for taking over after the revolt kadar 
had slowly gained respect abroad and at home by ushering in 
economic reforms in the 1960s 
but reform was halted in the 1970s unwise borrowing eventually 
led to economic stagnation and the highest per capita debt in the 
east bloc

prime minister yitzhak shamir said in an 
interview published today that palestinians who run in his proposed 
elections must agree that the occupied lands will not become an 
independent palestinian nation 
shamir told the jerusalem post the agreement would apply to an 
interim period of autonomy in the west bank and gaza strip and to 
negotiations on the final status of the territories seized by 
israel in 1967 
agreement has to be for the whole process he said 
shamir has suggested previously that he might ask for such an 
agreement before elections can be held but his interview with the 
post is his most wideranging statement on his plan 
leading palestinians in the occupied lands and the palestine 
liberation organization have said any elections must be part of a 
plan leading to palestinian independence 
they have turned down shamirs proposal but he has said he does 
not consider the rejection final 
under his proposal palestinians in the occupied lands would 
elect people to negotiate with israel on a fiveyear autonomy plan 
talks on the final status of the territories would begin in the 
third year 
shamir said he wanted agreement with a palestinian body 
before the balloting to ensure that those elected would not 
proclaim themselves the government of palestine or something 
like that 
he did not make clear what body he had in mind but repeated 
his governments refusal to negotiate with the plo which israel 
considers a terrorist organization 
it will have to be a palestinian body perhaps if egypt and 
jordan will want to join we will welcome them shamir said the 
west bank was captured from jordan the gaza strip from egypt 
today is memorial day in honor of israels war dead in a speech 
in observance of the day shamir said the creation of a palestinian 
state was out of the question because it would bring a 
beirutlike situation in the very midst of our country 
the reality of the middle east is that we must be a strong 
nation he told the united israel appeal a group of jews from 
around the world 
first strength then peace shamir said 
he told the post that for elections to take place israel also 
must convince palestinians that it can crush the 17month uprising 
against israeli occupation 
the uprising in which 465 palestinians and 21 israelis have 
been killed is seen in the occupied lands as the reason why 
sympathy with the palestinian cause has grown around the world 
shamir also said he would oppose having international observers 
for the elections as suggested by some palestinians 
we are sure if we proclaim general free and democratic 
elections then thats the way it will be he said

borden inc removed milk and other dairy 
products from stores in louisiana and mississippi for fear they 
might be contaminated but officials in both states said they 
believed there was no health threat 
borden the worlds largest dairy company pulled the products 
off store shelves monday in north louisiana and throughout 
mississippi after learning that milk from 32 northwest louisiana 
and east texas dairies might contain traces of a barium substance 
used in rat poison 
however gwen stewart a spokeswoman for the louisiana 
department of health and hospitals said officials believed no milk 
containing dangerous amounts of barium carbonate got as far as 
store shelves 
the bottom line is there is not and has not been any 
contaminated milk on the market she said 
dr ed thompson of the mississippi department of health said the 
traces of barium carbonate found in mississippi were too small to 
be dangerous 
theres just not a significant health risk involved 
thompson said in jackson miss 
ms stewart said some milk with traces of barium was allowed on 
the market but it was considered an acceptable level less than 
half that allowed in drinking water 
there were no reports of illness stemming from contaminated milk 
deaths of cattle at an east texas dairy farm on april 22 and a 
louisiana dairy farm on april 24 led officials in those states to 
withhold milk produced at those farms ms stewart said 
a check with a purina feed mill in shreveport revealed that feed 
used by the two farms had been carried in a rail car that had been 
used to carry barium carbonate 
barium carbonate is a white powder used in rat poison and in a 
variety of processes including manufacture of some kinds of glass 
and ceramics according to the mississippi emergency management 
agency it is toxic if swallowed 
ms stewart said frozen milk samples revealed the presence of 
barium from two parts per million to five parts per million 
she said there are no standards set for barium in milk however 
she and borden spokeswoman chris tilton said government standards 
for water limit barium to one part per million 
ms tilton contacted at bordens headquarters in columbus 
ohio said the company did not know whether any of the milk ice 
cream and other products it distributed to stores was contaminated 
but decided to withdraw them after learning louisiana tests 
detected barium

the bush administration faces the 
congressional equivalent of world war iii if it retaliates 
against a top nasa scientist who said the office of management and 
budget doctored his testimony on global warming a senate panel 
chairman says 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater meantime called the 
practice of alterations routine and said changes were made by a 
budget official four or five levels down from the top 
dr james hansen on monday told senators that omb forced him to 
contradict within his own prepared statement his finding that a 
buildup of greenhouse effect gases would increase the 
likelihood of drought 
sen albert gore jr praised hansen for speaking out at the 
senate hearing and warned that if administration officials 
attempt any kind of retribution in return for candor they will 
have on their hands the congressional equivalent of world war iii 
gore said this morning on nbcs today program that he 
questioned president bushs commitment to the environment saying 
proenvironmentalists in his administration were outnumbered by 
others who were pushing a donothing policy on global warming 
we should be leading instead of just dragging our feet and 
thats the fault of the president of the united states gore said 
he said the change in hansens testimony was an exercise in 
science fraud in the sense that they tried to mislead the congress 
into believing that the scientific evidence was not yet good enough 
to justify conclusions about the need for action on the greenhouse 
effect 
but fitzwater said the national aeronautics and space 
administration scientist was free to express his own views in 
answering committee questions 
hes never been muzzled the spokesman insisted hes free 
to say whatever he wants 
in testimony before gores science subcommittee of the senate 
commerce science and transportation committee hansen said he 
wouldnt object to a policy review by omb but he added i dont 
believe the scientific aspects in testimony should be altered i 
did try to get them to compromise i was not successful 
fitzwater said scientists inside and outside the government 
disagree on the global warming issue he complained that hansens 
original testimony gave the appearance that there was unanimity 
within the government on this matter we simply wanted to point out 
that there wasnt 
we thought we were commenting on policy not scientific 
evidence fitzwater said 
hansen complained about the alterations during his response to 
gores questions about the changes following submission of the 
toneddown written statement 
in the document hansen said it was unlikely scientists would 
alter the conclusions of computer models that greenhouse gases 
would increase drought in low and middle latitudes but the 
statement also contradicted the conclusion by saying in language 
inserted by omb that the computer models were not reliable 
hansen said officials also added a sentence that said it was 
unknown whether the buildup of greenhouse gases was from natural 
forces or from human activities hansen and others at the hearing 
said humans were primarily responsible by burning fossil fuel 
cutting down tropical rain forests and other actions 
every scientist that testified here today and every 
reputable scientist in the field supports your conclusion this is 
primarily a human cause its not an act of god omb forced you to 
say it may be just the forces of nature gore said 
theyre acting as if theyre scared of the truth the 
senator added its a form of scientific fraud by them the 
administration does not want to act it wants to sit still and do 
nothing 
the development came two days after it became known that the 
white house had rebuffed the suggestions of william reilly head of 
the environmental protection agency and other officials that the 
us government call for an international convention on global 
warming 
another government scientist dr jerry d mahlman of the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration said he had a 
similar experience with the budget office in congressional 
testimony he prepared in february 
mahlman said he successfully fought changes that would have been 
embarrassing to me in facing his fellow scientists and told 
senators if we do not have the right to be wrong we have 
squelched the right to be creative 
the greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earths 
atmosphere trap radiant heat near the planets surface in addition 
to natural buildup the gases have increased dramatically because 
of burning coal oil and gas as well as the destruction of 
tropical rain forests

the woman police call the godmother of a 
drug smuggling cult that killed 15 people said she was held hostage 
by group members after the ritual slayings were discovered 
sara aldrete villarreal said on monday she belonged to the cult 
and described its leader as enigmatic and mysterious but she 
again denied any role in the mutilation slayings at a ranch in 
matamoros near the us border 
i have never in my life participated in a human sacrifice 
the 24yearold woman said at a news conference i am sorry 
because of all the things that happened im sorry because of all 
the killing 
i dont know how i got into this without knowing what it 
was she said 
mexican authorities said adolfo de jesus constanzo and ms 
aldrete a former honor student at texas southmost college in 
brownsville directed the human sacrifices and other rituals 
including mutilations and boiling of brains and organs authorities 
said the rituals were meant to bring occult protection to the drug 
ring which allegedly trafficked in marijuana to the united states 
ms aldrete and four other people were arrested at a mexico city 
apartment saturday after a gunfight with police 
constanzo 26 and his righthand man martin quintana 
rodriguez were killed alvaro de leon valdez 22 one of those 
arrested said he shot the two to death on constanzos orders 
ms aldrete said on monday that she was watching television with 
constanzo known as the cults godfather at a mexico city 
apartment on april 12 when she learned of the killings 
he said theyve found the bodies we have to leave ms 
aldrete said i said what are you talking about and he said 
ok you want to know ill tell you and he told me how he did it 
and why 
de leon valdez told reporters on monday that ms aldrete was not 
involved in the killings discovered april 11 
at a news conference on sunday he discussed the slayings and 
said he watched earlier this year as mark kilroy 21 a university 
of texas premedical student was killed with a machete chop to the 
head and his spinal column removed for a necklace 
ms aldrete said she constanzo and other cult members fled 
briefly to brownsville just north of matamoros after police began 
digging up the bodies of victims living in brownsville it was 
like hell she said they treated me like a prisoner i was 
scared 
ms aldrete said the group returned to mexico city a few days 
later and stayed in small towns near the capital 
she said that several weeks ago the group moved into the 
apartment in a quiet middleclass mexico city neighborhood where 
police closed in saturday 
she did not describe how group members kept her from escaping or 
from contacting authorities 
ms aldrete said she was fascinated with constanzo ever since 
she met him in june 1987 he would order you to do something and 
you would do it but i dont know why he was like a leader or 
something we were like followers 
aldrete said constanzo initiated her into the christian santeria 
cult last year santeria an offshoot of voodoo is a blend of 
catholicism and old african beliefs that include animal sacrifices 
ms aldrete and the others arrested on saturday were booked on 
charges including homicide and criminal association

a 69yearold former army captain has been 
placed on three years probation and fined 10000 for conspiring 
to ship weapons to forces loyal to former philippine president 
ferdinand marcos 
us district judge alfred j lechner jr on monday also ordered 
leon dicker to perform 600 hours of community service 
dicker pleaded guilty monday admitting he tried to make the 
shipments in 1987 months before two coup attempts failed to return 
marcos to power 
dicker was convicted in 1987 and sentenced to four years in 
prison but a federal appeals court ruled that testimony was 
improperly introduced and overturned the verdict 
gemmo trinidad marcos spokesman in hawaii said he had not 
heard of the case and could not comment on it 
known as the general to his associates dicker was an army 
captain in world war ii and is a disbarred hewlett ny attorney 
he said he believed it would be in the united states interest to 
ship the arms to the philippines 
marcos fled the philippines feb 26 1986 amid an uprising that 
carried corazon aquino to power 
dicker was arrested in 1987 in a sting operation as he drove to 
what he believed was a warehouse containing the weapons 
the indictment said he conspired to ship m60 machine guns and 
israelimade uzi submachine guns to thailand dicker told the court 
that thailand was identified as a destination only to obtain an 
export license 
federal law requires that arms exports be licensed by the state 
department 
assistant us attorney claudia j flynn said an investigation 
was continuing in the case she supported the judges request for 
no prison time citing dickers cooperation with the investigation 
and his age

high of 205 last year authorities said today 
rudolf wyss chief of the federal narcotics police said the 
death rate per capita in switzerland was far higher than in 
neighboring european states he said there was no explanation for 
this 
in west germany which has 10 times the population of 
switzerland there were 674 drugrelated deaths last year he said 
over the past 10 years more than 1500 people in switzerland 
have died from drug abuse after a drop in the number of fatalities 
in the middle of the decade the death rate has risen sharply since 
1986 
although most deaths are due to heroin addiction wyss said the 
most significant feature in 1988 was a glut of cocaine south 
american suppliers have turned to europe because of plummeting 
prices on the drugsaturated us market he said 
wyss said there was little sign of crack cocaine the highly 
addictive drug used widely in the united states he said only two 
grams were seized in switzerland last year

whose brother and sisterinlaw drove from pittsburgh for the 
service

a mother whose infant daughter died after 
being born with cocaine in her system has been charged with 
involuntary manslaughter and delivery of a controlled substance to 
a minor authorities said 
melanie green 24 was arrested monday at her home and freed 
from jail on 3500 bail 
her daughter bianca died feb 4 two days after birth an 
autopsy showed she died of being deprived of oxygen before birth 
because of cocaine use by her mother authorities said the drug 
was in the childs urine police said 
it may be the first manslaughter case of its kind in illinois 
said winnebago county states attorney paul logli i think were 
cutting new ground here he said 
what were saying is this was an unintentional act but an 
unintentional act without lawful justification logli said we 
believe the medical cause of death of the child is related to the 
moms use of cocaine 
whether a judge or jury will fill in the blanks is what this 
case is all about 
last week winnebago county juvenile court judge frederick j 
kapala found a mother who used cocaine during her pregnancy guilty 
of child abuse and neglect the child was temporarily removed from 
the mothers custody 
that child now 3 months old has so far shown no serious health 
problems associated with cocaine 
use of cocaine during pregnancy logli said is a brand new 
social problem that is growing by alarming proportions we have to 
aspire to protect those people who cannot protect themselves 
in december a florida woman was charged with child abuse and 
delivery of drug after her child was born addicted to cocaine the 
child survived prosecutors said it was the first felony drug case 
of its kind in that state 
in 1987 a judge in california dismissed a charge of failure to 
provide medical care to a child lodged against a woman whose son 
was born brain damaged and later died 
prosecutors had accused her of ignoring a doctors advice not to 
abuse drugs and said the child had amphetamines in his system that 
contributed to his death

liberal reformer stipe suvar will 
step down as communist party chief next week to take a seat in the 
collective presidency and retain an influential role in national 
affairs 
news reports said today suvar will resign as head of the party 
on may 17 
because the party leadership rotates annually suvar would have 
had to give up that post next month in any case beginning in june 
the leadership transfers to a party official from the republic of 
macedonia 
suvar recently was elected to represent the republic of croatia 
in the nineman presidency and a party regulation adopted last 
year forbids officials from holding state and party jobs 
simultaneously 
suvar is to be formally inaugurated as a member of the federal 
presidency on may 15 this assures suvar a continued role on the 
national political stage where he is battling his serbian 
political rival slobodan milosevic 
milosevic is a more authoritarian orthodox communist than 
suvar although both men have backed marketoriented reforms to try 
and ease yugoslavias economic crisis 
milosevic on monday was proclaimed president of the republic of 
serbia which allows him to play a figurehead role in yugoslavias 
largest republic where he is already a hero for strengthening 
serbian influence in the nation 
but milosevics new post does not give him a seat in the federal 
presidency and he will have to give up his position as a member of 
the partys national politburo now that he has become head of state 
in serbia 
suvar and milosevic have battled over political issues but 
their disputes also reflect ethnic divides between the serbs the 
dominant ethnic group in yugoslavias patchwork of nationalities 
and the rival croats and other northern people 
yugoslavias late leader josip broz tito bequeathed the 
current political maze with the 1974 constitution that attempted to 
prevent any one of the countrys republics or nationalities from 
dominating national affairs 
but milosevic has strengthened serbian authority in the province 
of kosovo where the ethnic albanian majority rioted against 
milosevics policies in march clashes that left at least 24 dead 
media reports today quoted suvar as saying that because of the 
political quarrels within the party tomorrow we could have brutal 
clashes because of the mounting economic and political strife 
yugoslavia suffers an annual inflation rate of about 500 percent 
which has helped to fuel ethnic tensions 
suvar also complained that during his term as the party leader 
the serbian daily newspaper politika believed to be controlled by 
milosevics supporters has bitterly criticized him in 700 articles

tall and thin pete seeger stood in front of 
the microphone in his blue jeans and flowered shirt hat pushed 
back on his head and picked out the cords on his banjo 
hes still singing the same tunes and has changed little since 
the glory days of folk music two decades ago 
thousands of those jammed into and around the big tent at the 
new orleans jazz and heritage festival knew the words they stood 
and sang without prompting 
deep in my heart i do believe we shall overcome someday 
abbie hoffman is dead jerry rubin is part of the establishment 
jane fonda is selling exercise tapes and other activists of the 
1960s have either copped out burned out or dropped out but the 
70yearold folk singer from beacon ny is still at it 
seegers songs are the songs he sang for civil rights to ban 
the bomb to cry out against the war in vietnam and poverty and to 
fight for human rights throughout the world we shall overcome 
this land is your land 
the audience was made up of those who marched to his tunes 
during the turbulent 60s and who think of that era as history 
my records have never sold very well a thousand copies here 
1000 copies there but probably every elementary school system in 
the country has at least one teacher who has at least one of them 
and so kids grow up knowing my work seeger said of his continued 
popularity 
he continues to perform once or twice a week 
i usually sing to small groups 100 200 people i still have 
things to tell them nobody in this world knows all the answers 
all we can do is encourage people to hope i try to do that he 
said 
his values once the trendy slogans of a generation have held 
up for him he lists his heroes as those who suffered on the front 
lines to bring civil rights to the south and peace to southeast 
asia 
seeger said hes thoroughly respectable now disgracefully so 
that wasnt always true at the height of the mccarthy era he was 
held in contempt of congress and banned from television in 1949 
while marching with the actor author and singer paul robeson 
seeger was attacked by members of the ku klux klan 
would he rather be remembered for his music or his politics 
seeger said it doesnt matter what matters he said is what he 
can do now 
ive always said that my epitaph will be he done his 
damnedest 
seegers second book everybody say freedom written with 
robert reser is due out this year he and arlo guthrie may do a 
concert together later this year he is devoted to the clearwater 
project an effort he organized years ago to help clean up the 
polluted hudson river in new york and new jersey he also is 
working for world disarmament 
its one of the most important issues there is he said 
the 60s may not get a curtain call but seegers not the only 
one carrying on that tradition 
there are still people who care he said still people who 
think they can make things better as long as that is true in this 
country were ok theres an old saying hope is the opiate of 
the masses i guess im still singing about hope who knows if 
people listen long enough it may make them think about more than 
the music who knows

senate republican leader bob dole today called 
for resumption of significant military aid to contra rebels if 
the leftist government in nicaragua fails to hold a free election 
and abide by its results 
testifying before the privately financed commission on free and 
fair elections in nicaragua the kansas senator said he is not 
optimistic about the outlook for next years balloting 
the panel of three democrats and three republicans was 
established by the world freedom foundation a selfstyled research 
and educational organization based in alexandria va 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega signed an agreement with el 
salvador guatemala honduras and costa rica in february in which 
he promised electoral and other legal reforms to ensure fair 
general elections which are to be held in february last week 
however the sandinista government rejected an opposition demand to 
negotiate further reforms 
in my view dole said by far the best way to keep 
pressure on the sandinistas would have been to continue effective 
aid to the freedom fighters the term given to the contras by 
their supporters in the united states but realistically that is 
not an option for the immediate future 
congress ended military aid to the contra rebels at the end of 
february 1988 
and i am not optimistic that there are enough remaining points 
of leverage to put real heat on managua to live up to its own 
commitments and its responsibility to the citizens of nicaragua i 
hope i am wrong 
i hope so but candidly i am not very optimistic dole 
said the record so far as manifest for example in the sham 
of a new elelction law recnetly promulgated by the comandantes is 
hardly encouraging 
what if next february comes and goes and there is no free 
elelction perhaps not even any election dole asked what if 
the sandinistas win the election through fraud or lose the 
elelction but refuse to yield power 
in that event he said i hope that we will articulate and 
implement a policy that will apply direct and effective pressure on 
the sandinistas including through the resumption of significant 
military aid to a revitalized democratic resistance 
the bush administration has abandoned plans to seek immediate 
military aid which was the consistent policy of the reagan 
administration and recently reached a bipartisan agreement with 
congress providing for nonmilitary assistance 
the world freedom foundation is headed by l brent bozell iii a 
prominent conservative the cochairmen of the commission are 
curtin winsor jr former us ambassador to costa rica in the 
reagan administration gaylord nelson former democratic senator 
from wisconsin sergio bendixen a democratic political consultant 
alan keyes former assistant secretary of state for international 
organization affairs in the reagan administration elaine kamarck 
a democratic political consultant and victor gold who served as 
an advisor to president bush in 1980 and 1984

the civilian government of president 
vinicio cerezo said it thwarted a coup attempt today by air force 
officers and soldiers 
government spokesman carlos anleu said troops loyal to cerezo 
arrested an undetermined number of air force personnel who 
participated in the coup attempt which lasted about two hours 
everything is under control anleu said he said the coup 
was put down with no shots fired 
the attempt was staged by a tactical unit of the air force based 
south of guatemala city in a military section of the international 
airport anleu said and was led by retired military officers he 
did not identify them 
the coup attempt was stopped when soldiers loyal to the 
government entered the city in tanks and helicopters the spokesman 
said 
about 630 am troops and soldiers many wearing the blue 
handerkerchiefs that are a sign of loyalists surrounded the home 
of the defense minister gen alejandro gramajo military planes 
and helicopters flew overhead and tanks were parked strategically 
nearby 
in may 1988 a military coup attempt failed when gramajo refused 
to join it and backed the civilian government 
by 830 am most of the troops had returned to their barracks 
and the aircraft returned to their bases morning rushhour 
activity had returned to normal in the capital radio stations 
played military music during the attempt then returned to normal 
programming 
in washington a state department official said reports from the 
us embassy and from guatemalans also indicated the coup attempt 
was unsuccessful the official said the coup attempt may have been 
aimed not at cerezo whose whereabouts were unknown but at granajo 
or other cabinet ministers 
cerezo took office in january 1986 heading the first elected 
civilian administration in 16 years he had been under attack from 
the right wing for opening talks with the leftist insurgency the 
revolutionary union which has been conducting a guerrilla war for 
30 years 
during the attempted coup by army officers on may 11 1988 two 
columns of troops marched on the capital to seize power but their 
attempt was quashed without a shot being fired six officers were 
arrested 
on april 16 cerezo blamed rightist paramilitary groups for a 
growing wave of violence and said they threatened the nations 
democracy democracy is being put in danger by the recklessness 
of some groups and people who constantly violate the law he said 
in a nationally broadcast address 
the president blamed the rightwing groups for the death of irma 
esquivel de lara 37 a criminal court judge who was gunned down on 
a street in the capital earlier in april 
there exist some groups traditionally of the extreme right 
that arent happy with democracy they dont like it that we are 
satisfied with a democratic government cerezo said at the time 
cerezo 46 a christian democrat is due to leave office in 1991 
the central american nation of 85 million people about the 
size of tennessee is bounded on the north and west by mexico the 
south by the pacific ocean and the east by el salvador honduras 
and belize 
guatemala never has sustained a modern democratic govenment it 
is widely agreed that civilian authority exists because of military 
consent and supervision 
guatemala was widely shunned by the international community 
while the country was under the military rulers of the early 1980s 
the armed forces and death squads linked to the military were 
blamed for killing tens of thousands of people the army denied the 
charges 
thousands of indians were killed or driven into the hills more 
than half the population is made up of indians who speak two dozen 
mayan dialects 
former president carter cut off us aid to the country but 
nonmilitary aid was restored under the reagan administration

journalists for chinas official media gave the 
government a petition tuesday with more than 1000 signatures 
calling for a dialogue on censorship while hundreds of students 
chanted their support 
restrictions of every kind have prevented full objective and 
fair reporting on recent student protests for democratic reform 
said the petition it was a rare expression of discontent by 
chinas reporters many of whom are members of the ruling communist 
party 
the petition said there was a need for party propaganda 
officials to meet with reporters on censorship and the recent 
firing of the editor of chinas most liberal paper after he 
rejected censors demands 
li datong an editor at the china youth news and organizer of 
the petition later said he heard reports that hu qili a top party 
official responsible for media affairs already had agreed to a 
dialogue 
we dont hope for this dialogue to have direct results he 
said such things are achieved by a process but we think this 
dialogue will be a good beginning 
hundreds of journalists jammed the offices of the allchina 
journalists association a governmentsponsored organization to 
hand in the petition with 1013 signatures signers included 
reporters from the xinhua news agency the peoples daily and china 
central television 
outside about 500 students from beijing university and other 
schools waved banners on press freedom and chanted the media 
should tell the truth 
yang yi an official at the journalists association who accepted 
the petitition said he would give it to party officials and would 
try to help organize a dialogue he also promised the associaton 
would make efforts for media reform 
li said he thought it was possible shanghai authorities would 
reinstate qin benli the editor of the weekly world economic 
herald but only if more appeals are made on his behalf under qin 
the herald printed more lively controversial articles than any 
other chinese publication and his dismissal has caused outcries 
from journalists students and other academics 
we are very embarrassed by our position during such a 
largescale student movement that aroused concern domestically and 
overseas said guo jiakuan a reporter for china youth news 
the official media initially maintained silence on the student 
protests that began april 15 and were the largest in 40 years of 
communist rule xinhua later issued brief reports on the protests 
and only a few newspapers made clear the huge scale of the marches 
and the broad support from ordinary citizens 
many reporters attended the marches and handed in stories and 
photographs but said their editors decided not to use most of it 
for fear it would fuel the protests 
even xinhuas report of the journalists petition bore the 
censors mark in quoting from the petition xinhua removed 
references to restrictions and deleted the journalists denial 
that china has a free press it added of the reporters complaints 
this is just a problem to be solved during the reform of the news 
reporting system 
the students rely on the foreign press to promote chinas 
democracy complained a woman from the academy of social 
sciences news research department this is a disgrace for the 
chinese press 
one of the key demands of the students is a free press 
the students who gathered outside the journalists association 
said they wanted to support the reporters petition the students 
also are demanding their own dialogue with government leaders on a 
broad range of political reforms including guarantee of human 
rights 
we are extremely thankful for your support in our struggle 
li told the students 
the students who arrived on bicycle with red flags and banners 
flying regrouped in nearby tiananmen square where tens of 
thousands of students have rallied in the past three weeks then 
they bicycled across town to hold an hourlong sitin outside the 
offices of the peoples daily the mouthpiece of the ruling 
communist party 
editorinchief come out they chanted they also quoted 
from writings of senior leader deng xiaoping saying society should 
be changed democratically not by violence 
student leader wuer kaixi said in a speech directed at those in 
the peoples daily office television newspapers and radio must 
speak the truth the people no longer believe you reform 
yourselves 
student activists said they planned similar protests at the 
offices of china central television and xinhua

the hydrogen bomb that sank in secrecy off 
okinawa in 1965 was just one of 48 nuclear weapons and 11 reactors 
lost at sea by the soviet union and the united states since world 
war ii says the environmental group greenpeace 
the most recent loss was a soviet mikeclass submarine off the 
coast of norway april 7 with two nuclear reactors aboard said 
joshua handler one of the greenpeace activists who prepared the 
report 
the most serious loss was a soviet yankeeclass submarine that 
sank in the atlantic ocean oct 6 1986 off the coast of bermuda 
yankeeclass subs are believed to carry 16 ssn6 ballistic 
missiles with two warheads apiece and to be powered by two 
nuclear reactors according to western defense analysts 
greenpeace said that most of the nuclear weapons and reactors 
littering the ocean floor were lost at sea by the soviet union 
which despite its newfound openness remains far more secretive 
about its nuclear armaments than does the united states 
handler interviewed by telephone monday declined to provide a 
complete list of the 48 nuclear weapons and 11 reactors he believes 
are on the ocean floor he said a full list of the nuclear devices 
greenpeace believes are on the ocean floor will be released next 
month 
known incidents include 
the soviet mikeclass submarine april 7 1989 with two 
reactors 
the soviet yankeeclass submarine in 1986 with 32 warheads and 
two reactors 
a soviet novemberclass submarine in 1970 with two reactors 
the us submarine scorpion in 1968 with one reactor 
the us b43 bomb from the ticonderoga in 1965 
the us submarine thresher in 1963 with one reactor 
sixteen years after the okinawa accident the us navy 
acknowledged it had lost a b43 bomb aboard an a4 attack plane off 
the aircraft carrier uss ticonderoga on dec 5 1965 as the ship 
steamed toward port in japan after bombing missions off vietnam 
in its 1981 statement the navy said the incident had taken took 
place more than 500 miles from land at sea in the pacific 
but handler and william arkin defense analyst for the institute 
for policy studies a liberal washingtonbased research center 
said they had discovered from the ticonderogas logs that the 
accident occurred in international waters about 80 miles from the 
closest point of the okinawa island chain and only 200 miles or so 
east of the heavily populated island of okinawa 
at the time of the accident okinawa was under us control it 
was returned to japan in 1972 
the navy said in 1981 that the jet rolled off the elevator of 
a us aircraft carrier and fell into the sea and that the pilot 
plane and bomb were all lost 
arkin said monday there was little danger of detonation from the 
onemegaton bomb which has a force of 1 million tons of tnt but 
the 15 kilograms of plutonium in the bomb he added could threaten 
the environment as it deteriorates 
the a4 was the navys main deepstrike aircraft at the time 
and an undisclosed number on each us carrier would always be 
equipped with b43 hydrogen bombs arkin said 
the navy on monday maintained its policy of not commenting on 
whether its ships carry nuclear weapons

returns from four of 40 election districts showed gen manuel 
antonio noriegas handpicked presidential candidate carlos duque 
leading opposition candidate guillermo endara by 80646 votes to

the announcement came after former president jimmy carter said 
noriegas men were stealing the vote with counterfeit tallies it 
also followed a street demonstration by more than 15000 protesters

one seriously 
i hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator 
stealing the election from his own people said carter an 
invited observer

nation 
the government had originally said it would announce complete 
results within 24 hours of sundays poll closing 
the vote center was closed this morning and there was no 
indication when more results would be released 
carter said monday voting records stolen on sunday night and 
early monday had been substituted with bogus replacements not 
signed by opposition party members as is required 
carter had to use a hotel lobby for his news conference because 
he was denied the use of the governmentrun press center he said 
panamanian cooperation with his mission vanished as soon as he 
raised the fraud issue 
the government today also removed all equipment for feeding 
television signals via satellite from its press center forcing 
networks to fly tape to costa rica 
carter who observed voting in several precincts sunday said he 
would have had no problems with what he saw if the vote count was 
honest 
he met monday with endara and congratulated him on his victory 
carter departed early this morning from howard air force base 
said lt col james swank a spokesman for the us southern 
command 
sundays vote was considered a referendum on noriega panamas

united states has been trying to oust him for more than a year 
in washington president bush and top advisers met monday and 
discussed further steps an administration official said options 
included more economic sanctions and sending additional troops to 
reinforce the 10000 us service personnel based in the former 
canal zone 
both endara and noriegas duque had claimed victories by wide 
margins before any official results were released 
exit polls by the opposition and the roman catholic church gave 
endara about 70 percent of the vote a similar poll by 
progovernment parties gave their candidate the victory 
panamanian law requires election results to be made public 
within 24 hours after polls close in 1984 in results widely 
believed to be fraudulent the government waited three days before 
declaring itself the winner 
this election was a terrible fraud on the panamanian people 
said rep larry smith dfla a member of an uninvited observer 
delegation sent by bush polls opened late peoples names were 
not on lists dead peoples names were on lists after years of not 
appearing on lists 
duque denounced what he said was obvious american intervention 
in affairs that concern only panama and said the claims of stolen 
tallies were the stuff of a soap opera plot 
uspanama relations have been poor since february 1988 when 
noriega orchestrated the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle 
and the cia reportedly contributed 10 million to the opposition 
campaign 
delvalle had tried to fire the general after he was indicted in 
florida on drugsmuggling and moneylaundering charges noriega 
claims the us charges are a smokescreen to avoid ceding control 
of the panama canal in 1999 under a 1977 treaty 
on monday troops fired 50 to 100 rounds of shotgun pistol and 
carbine fire mostly into the air to break up the protest march 
the shooting started as a car bearing large duque posters drove 
into the crowd demonstators threw stones at it but scattered when 
men in civilian clothes inside the car opened fire 
troops in riot gear began firing into the air and the men leaped 
from the car firing ak47 assault rifles carbines and shotguns 
into the air 
they identified themselves only as being of the people 
those hit by gunfire were a panamanian television cameraman 
seriously wounded in the chest a reporter for the paris newspaper 
le monde and a marcher 
the circumstances surrounding the shootings were not immediately 
clear 
in miami on monday sens connie mack rfla and bob graham 
dfla said the united states should consider armed intervention 
and abrogation of the panama canal treaty if noriega holds on to 
power 
the two were among the election observers sent by bush

beijing university students proud of their 
schools rich history of leading revolutionary and nationalist 
campaigns desperately are trying to keep alive the democracy 
movement that has lost steam on other campuses 
it has a long history of fighting for democracy one 
undergraduate said during a monday night campus march to drum up 
support for a 2weekold class boycott beijing university is 
always at the vanguard of the student movements 
its students are remembered for leading the landmark may 4 
1919 uprising in which intellectuals demanded democracy and 
science to modernize china 
now 70 years later beijing university students have emerged as 
the keeper of the flame of a nearly monthold movement for more 
freedom in this authoritarian society 
all of china watches beijing all of beijing watches beijing 
university one poster said after most other campuses ended the 
class boycott this past weekend 
activists no longer talk of staging more mass marches that 
brought tens of thousands of people into the capitals streets but 
say they will print newspapers and pamphlets to press their views 
however many of the more than 10000 students at beijing 
university the nations most prestigious school are hanging 
tough they argue that further pressure on the government is needed 
to open a dialogue with communist officials to demand press freedom 
and a halt to corruption 
within hours of the announcement that student activists planned 
to end the citywide class strike angry posters emerged at beijing 
university urging students to boycott to the end students 
quickly voted to continue the strike until at least friday and 
perhaps twothirds of them stayed away from class monday 
about 1300 beijing university students staged a noisy march 
around campus late monday chanting one two boycott class 
and urging teachers to join some said they hope their continued 
defiance will convince other major universities to resume the 
boycott 
this school is the seed of the democracy movement said one 
marcher explaining why many beijing university students have 
refused to follow others back to class 
i want to go to class we all do said another but we 
cant because we havent got any real results 
on tuesday students at two other universities were planning to 
rejoin beijing university and resume the boycott and a new wave of 
the big character posters that provide a primary means of political 
expression appeared 
some beijing university students said they are considering a 
bicycle procession through beijing 
beijing university students remain feisty for several reasons 
students say they have not experienced the strong pressure to end 
the strike applied by authorities at other schools 
pride in the 90yearold school for its leadership in previous 
campaigns by intellectuals to awaken the masses also has spurred 
the students to action 
the school was set up as the peking imperial university in 1898 
during the 100day reform movement that attempted to introduce 
some western ideas in government and education to the fast 
declining qing dynasty 
among major personalities at the school in its first decades 
were chen duxiu a father of chinese leftism and li dazhao one of 
chinas first marxists when he was school librarian one of lis 
assistants was a country boy named mao tsetung 
mao went on to establish the peoples republic of china in 1949 
eight years later when he encouraged critics to speak out beijing 
university teachers declared that the masses want to overthrow 
the communist party they were among the first to be purged in a 
subsequent crackdown 
the school occupies 500 acres of wooded land in northwest 
beijing it includes imperialstyle buildings with red pillars and 
slanted tiled roofs as well as blocks of dank and dreary 
dormitories where each room houses about six students

president roh taewoo called tuesday 
for a tougher crackdown on violent protesters and declared the 
government has gone through a stage of selfrestraint 
the fate of the country hinges on whether law and order can be 
maintained roh told a special cabinet meeting to discuss 
measures to end violent antigovernment demonstrations 
however some opposition members who contend police inflame 
rioters called tuesday in the national assembly for the government 
to limit police use of tear gas 
roh on the other hand ordered cabinet ministers to use all 
government and security force resources to clamp down on radical 
students dissidents and striking workers who resort to violence 
he accused them of plotting a leftist revolution to overthrow 
what he called south koreas liberal democratic system 
rohs warning came after six riot policemen were burned to death 
and 10 others critically injured in a may 3 clash with radical 
students in southern pusan it was the worst political violence in 
south korea in recent years 
the incident prompted a nationwide call against political 
violence and the government swiftly arrested several radical 
leaders 
under mounting public pressure the main radical national 
council of student representatives last week renounced violence 
the group said it would not use firebombs if authorities ease 
controls on antigovernment demonstrations 
on tuesday 6600 students peacefully demonstrated at 21 
universities and colleges in seoul and elsewhere no clashes was 
reported police said 
at some schools police said students even destroyed hundreds of 
firebombs before starting antigovernment rallies or campus marches 
at a special session of the national assembly on tuesday many 
ruling and opposition lawmakers supported proposals to ban 
firebombs a main protest weapon 
but some opposition members objected they claimed excessive use 
of tear gas has tended to aggravate violent protests 
the main opposition parties which have condemned violent 
protests plan a major attack on the government during the session 
based on charges roh has failed to carry out promised democratic 
reforms 
top opposition leaders kim youngsam and kim daejung are 
demanding the resignation of rohs entire cabinet to accept 
responsibility for the political unrest 
roh told tuesdays cabinet meeting he will use police to end 
violent strikes and protests 
we cannot allow indefinitely a situation in which some 
campuses become hotbeds for training leftist revolutionary forces 
and bases for producing firebombs and leftist revolution roh 
said 
radical students and antigovernment dissident groups have 
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme 
political views

a top american jewish leader said tuesday that 
palestinian participants in proposed elections should not be banned 
from the elective process for advocating an independent state for 
their people 
i would not think that advocating such a position would be a 
bar to being elected or engaging in the elective process seymour 
reich told reporters at the national press club 
reich is head of the national bnai brith organization and 
chairman of the conference of presidents of major american jewish 
groups 
his comments came in reaction to an interview with israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir published tuesday by the jerusalem post 
in which shamir said that palestinians who run in elections that he 
has proposed must agree that the occupied lands will not become an 
independent palestinian nation 
shamir told the newspaper the agreement would apply to an 
interim period of autonomy in the west bank and gaza strip and to 
negotiations on the final status of the territories seized by 
israel in 1967 
if elections are to be conducted they have to be conducted in 
a free atmosphere of speech without threat of violence or 
intimidation and i would think someone seeking office running on 
a platform can espouse any position that they want to including 
land for peace including an independent palestinian state i dont 
see anything objectionable to that reich said 
i think anyone can run as long as they are not terrorists or 
identified as such he added 
reich met with reporters to mark the 41st anniversary of the 
founding of israel an event being celebrated starting at sundown 
tuesday 
after 41 years of fighting in a sea of hostile countries he 
said this tiny island of a state continues to exist in a 
democratic environment 
reich gave president bush a rating of 98 in his dealings with 
israel saying that 98 out of 100 is not bad 
bush has made many positive steps in working toward peace in the 
middle east reich said 
the reason bush got 98 instead of 100 reich said was because 
of a statement opposing the occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip which did not also note that the areas were occupied as a 
defensive measure not out of aggression 
while shamir has suggested previously that he might ask for such 
an agreement by palestinian candidates avoiding calls for 
independence his interview was his most wideranging statement on 
his plan 
leading palestinians in the occupied lands and the palestine 
liberation organization have said any elections must be part of a 
plan leading to palestinian independence

pope john paul ii has dismissed criticism of his 
foreign pilgrimages as prejudice and says he intends to keep 
traveling 
in an interview published tuesday he expressed hope of being 
able to visit other countries in eastern europe besides his native 
poland noting the winds of change blowing in the communist bloc 
i think we are talking often of prejudice john paul was 
quoted as saying in the interview with an italian newspaper group 
he returned saturday from africa the 41st foreign trip in his 
10year pontificate 
at the start of his papacy john paul said some at the vatican 
had advised against a visit to a meeting of latin american bishops 
in mexico which his predecessor john paul i had decided not to 
attend 
it seemed to me that the pope should be present at that 
important appointment of the church in latin america he said 
the trip in january 1979 was john pauls first foreign pilgrimage 
he acknowledged that some in the west in europe have 
accused him of triumphalism which blocks the ecumenical 
process and suggested it would be better for him to engage in 
dialogue than draw crowds 
but that is what he does john paul said citing his meeting 
with american bishops when he visited the united states in 1987 and 
the recent meeting with a delegation of us bishops at the 
vatican which he termed very useful 
its not dialogue what i will be doing within a few weeks with 
the lutheran brothers in scandinavia he asked referring to his 
next pilgrimage that begins june 1 
john paul said hes convinced the trips are useful 
he noted that besides his three pilgrimages to poland he has not 
been able to go beyond the eastern frontier of europe 
i think however that with all that is happening there it 
will be the circumstances as always to decide i have always felt 
myself guided by circumstances that is by providence

a hungarian energy official tuesday was 
quoted as saying a controversial dam project opposed by tens of 
thousands of environmentalists could be stopped in the nations 
interest 
the statement was the latest sign hungary may pull out of the 
project a multimilliondollar plan with czechoslovakia and austria 
to make the danube river more navigable and build power stations in 
czechoslovakia and hungary 
about 140000 hungarians have signed a petition calling for a 
referendum on the project which has been under fire since it was 
first agreed to in the late 1970s 
opposition in hungary has become more vocal as democratic groups 
have gained more say in politics in recent months the more 
orthodox czechoslovak communists who insist the project should be 
completed expressed irritation with the opposition in their party 
daily last weekend 
the plan to build the hungarian dam at nagymaros about 30 miles 
upstream from budapest on the danube is seen by many hungarians as 
a symbol of the centralized economic planning of the past in which 
citizens were given no say 
czechoslovak officials already have invested 11 billion in a 
much larger dam and power station being built as part of the 
project at gabcikovo about 40 miles east of bratislava 
environmentalists have long argued the project affecting more 
than 60 miles of the danube will destroy wetlands with unique 
wildlife they also claim a huge underground reservoir of drinking 
water will be spoiled by the power stations and canals to be built 
along the river 
our position is that the nagymaros construction can be halted 
but gabcikovo must be completed istvan papp director of 
hungarys state energy economy institute told the daily mai nap 
newspaper on tuesday 
this compromise would be a solution best serving the nations 
interests he added 
experts on both sides acknowledge the projects are too 
interrelated for gabcikovo to be effective without the hungarian 
dam 
hungarys government and parliament are to debate the call for a 
referendum on nagymaros this month however even opponents of the 
project question the wisdom of putting such a complex issue to a 
popular vote 
papp said the government would save half a billion dollars by 
stopping investment in the project which on the hungarian side has 
been financed in part by austria in return for future deliveries of 
electricity 
papp said his calculations did not include the cost of 
compensating austria and czechoslovakia if hungary pulled out of 
the project

secretary of state james a baker iii 
on a stopover here for his trip to moscow discussed soviet affairs 
and international relations tuesday with finnish president mauno 
koivisto 
neutral finland has traditionally close ties and a friendship 
treaty with the soviet union koivisto was in moscow last october 
at a luncheon both baker and president koivisto expressed the 
wish to see a continuation in perestroika said arno karhilo 
foreign ministry undersecretary of state 
baker also met separately with prime minister harri holkeri 
arriving here monday night baker praised the state of 
usfinnish relations and lauded the finnish contribution to the 
un peacekeeping forces which he said give this country an 
important role in many global issues of interest to both our 
countries 
baker heads to moscow on wednesday seeking president mikhail s 
gorbachevs help in forging peace in the middle east and playing 
down the issue of arms control 
baker is trying to prod israel into negotiations with the 
palestinians and has concluded he needs the support of both moscow 
and the palestine liberation organization he is hoping the soviets 
under gorbachev would bring the pressure it has refused to exert in 
the past on syria to support peace talks that do not hold out the 
promise of a palestinian state 
on the arms control front baker heads to moscow with a date 
the third week in june for the reopening of ussoviet 
negotiations to reduce the superpowers longrange bombers nuclear 
submarines and globegirdling missiles 
but he was not planning to outline the position the united 
states would take at the table nor was he assuring the soviets 
that there would be no changes since the talks were recessed in 
november 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets can expect to see a considerable degree of continuity 
with the positions of the prior administration but added we 
reserve the right to change and modify some of those positions 
the two sides had about 90 percent of a weaponsreduction treaty 
completed when the talks recessed but several knotty issues stood 
in the way of an agreement 
these included whether to try to ban mobile intercontinental 
ballistic missiles and how to verify arsenals of cruise missiles 
aboard ships and warplanes

president bush today weighed options ranging 
from military intervention to economic actions toward panama in 
reaction to an election us officials say was riddled with fraud 
his spokesman said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater would not elaborate 
on the possible options but hinted that provisions of the 1977 
panama canal treaties might be used to intensify pressures against 
panamas defacto ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
the bottom line us posistion remains that noriega must go 
fitzwater said 
we are convinced that the oppossition candidates had the 
support and the votes to fairly win this election and we are just 
as convinced that the noriega regime made every effort took every 
opportunity and had every intention of stealing this election 
regardless of the actual vote fitzwater said of sundays 
ballotting 
in a formal statement read to white house reporters the 
spokesman said the united states has been considering options 
that range from the use of military force to varoius economic and 
commerical moves related to united states pressure in that 
country 
he said us officials are in contact with democratic allies in 
the region seeking to enlist their support for the antinoriega 
move 
there is no plan to abrogate the canal treaties under which 
the united states has agreed to turn the americanbuilt canal over 
to panamanian control on the last day of this century fitzwater 
said however we do have concerns about how they are carried 
out 
he mentioned provisions dealing with protection of us citizens 
in the isthmus and the seatosea strategic canal itself saying 
those could be very useful to the united states in its 
dealings with noriega 
fitzwater said us troops in panama are on a very high state 
of alert 
fitzwater made the comments after bush was briefed by members of 
an official observer team that he sent to monitor the election 
sunday 
he didnt leave anything out of the discussion every 
conceivable range of options was discussed said rep john 
murtha dpa who headed the delegation former president jimmy 
carter who led another observer group was to meet with the 
president tonight to give his report on the sunday elections 
the observers reported widespread fraud to favor carlos duque 
the presidential candidate of panamas de facto ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
theres a lot more support for that military option today 
than there was say six months or a year ago said sen connie 
mack rfla another member of the observer team 
sen john mccain rariz said the scenario of sending tanks 
in the streets of panama city is not one tht i could foresee under 
any circumstances but the option of the military is one that 
should not be totally ruled out but at the same time should not be 
embraced without totally exhausting every other option 
murtha said the president listened intently but gave no 
indication as to what he might do 
it seemed a sense of urgency in the room i felt that the 
president feels that this is something he cant let sit theres 
a real sense of urgency that something has to be done said 
murtha 
sen bob graham dfla said he was recommending a threepart 
course of action internationalize the issue by getting latin 
american allies to join in denunciations of noriega develop a 
bipartisan consensus on us action and prepare the stricter 
options the united states might take 
time is of the essence theres a very brief period in which 
world opinion will give us the environment in which we can take the 
kind of action necessary to remove noriega said graham 
mccain suggested beefing up the us bases in panama with more 
combatants and not ruling out any military action he said 
military dependents should be moved out of the area and us 
citizens there shoudl be warned there could be problems for them 
we are deeply concerned by evidence pouring in of electoral 
fraud on the part of the pronoriega forces the state department 
said monday night joining members of congress in criticizing the 
elections 
bush brushed aside reporters questions today as he sat down 
with his observer team to get a firsthand report on what they saw 
during and after sundays ballotting 
some 10000 us military personnel are based in panama at 
military installations which remain under us control despite the 
decadeold treaty that cedes control of the panama canal to that 
central american country at the end of the century 
the official state department statement issued 24 hours after 
the polls closed in panama appeared to lay the groundwork for an 
official announcement that the united states was not prepared to 
recognize the outcome of the election if the process was perceived 
to be rigged in duques favor 
president bush indicated last week he would pursue that policy 
rather than move toward a more normal relationship with the 
panamanian government 
us officials expected that panamanian authorities at some 
point will declare duque the winner but some wondered whether 
noriega will be able to survive what they regard as an obvious 
embarrassment for him 
in addition to the allegations of fraud the election day scenes 
indicated strong backing for the opposition slate 
observers said members of the noriegaled defense forces were 
allowed to vote multiple times because unlike other panamanians 
they were not assigned to a specific voting station 
people who were dead were all of a sudden reappearing on 
rolls when they had been dropped off said rep larry smith 
dfla so dead people could vote but live people couldnt 
sen richard lugar ranking minority member of the foreign 
relations committee said the opposition appeared to be winning a 
huge majority even though many of noriegas supporters voted more 
than once 
sen christopher dodd dconn said the united states should 
join with other hemispheric countries in applying diplomatic 
pressure on panama if the election outcome is based on fraud 
us officials saw the election as perhaps the best opportunity 
in almost a year to achieve its goal of removing noriega from 
panamas political life he was indicted by a us federal grand 
jury last year on drug trafficking charges 
officials had hoped that the elections would become an event 
around which noriegas opponents could rally

connecticuts supreme court reluctantly 
ruled that a mother who abandoned her 2yearold son is entitled to 
half the 300000 awarded his estate after the boys death 13 years 
later 
justice robert j callahan said in a unanimous decision that 
suzanne benson could collect 150000 because state inheritance 
laws do not distinguish between parents who abandon their children 
and those who raise them 
in a rare move however the supreme court recommended on monday 
that the legislature change the law currently a parent can be 
denied half the estate only if parental rights have been formally 
terminated after a court hearing 
it does create an unjust situation said attorney kerin m 
woods who represented kenneth hotarek of old lyme the boys 
father 
hotarek and benson divorced when their son paul hotarek was 2 
he died at age 15 in 1986 when his bicycle collided with a car the 
fathers insurance company paid a settlement to the boys estate 
because the motorist was underinsured 
benson who had moved to hurricane utah learned of her sons 
death 17 months later she filed for half of the estate as 
provided by state law in cases of children who die without a will 
hotarek testified that from 1973 until their sons death benson 
had no contact with their son and provided no financial or 
emotional support 
attorney edward b oconnell who represented benson noted that 
there was never a trial to determine whether benson had in fact 
abandoned her son

the cost of modernizing the nations strategic 
forces could result in internal budgeting cannibalism of 
conventional forces if the bush administration holds to current 
plans a private group said tuesday 
the defense budget project estimated that spending for 
development of such strategic weapons as the railgarrison mx 
nuclear missile the midgetman and the b2 stealth bomber will 
increase about 29 percent in addition to increases to keep up with 
inflation through fiscal year 1996 
meanwhile defense secretary dick cheney has proposed zero 
growth in the overall defense budget including cuts of 10 billion 
in fiscal 1990 to meet the compromise agreement reached by the 
white house and congress proposed growth in later years would 
match inflation 
given budgetary constraints on defense strategic forces must 
compete with conventional forces for scarce funds the report 
said if the defense budget as a whole is cut or grows only 
enough to keep pace with inflation the projected growth in funding 
for strategic forces would come at the expense of funding for 
conventional forces 
dr gordon adams director of the defense budget project called 
the possible results internal budgeting cannibalism and said 
conventional forces and military readiness would pay the price 
it would mirror what we did in the 1980s adams said in a 
telephone interview 
the defense budget project is a nonprofit research organization 
that takes a critical look at pentagon spending the organization 
was founded in 1983 
in its 66page report strategic forces funding in the 1990s 
a renewed buildup the group said money for strategic forces can 
be controlled by either eliminating weapons programs or slowing 
production 
the report recommends that the bush administration and congress 
revise strategic modernization plans the administration is 
currently conducting a strategy review with a final report expected 
later this month 
specifically the report said a reduced reliance on 
intercontinental ballistic missiles is the cheaper option while 
mobility of the icbms is the most expensive 
cheney has proposed moving the 50 multiplewarhead mx nuclear 
missiles from their silos to railroad cars while spending 100 
million on development of the singlewarhead midgetman missile 
the report also said that bombers are the most costly aspect of 
strategic forces and a decision must be made on whether to produce 
the b2 after acquiring the b1b 
under the current budget proposal production of the b2 will be 
pushed back a year to 1993 with almost 41 billion cut from the 
fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the radarevading plane 
the report also said that funding demands for star wars can be 
reduced by stressing longterm research rather than nearterm 
deployment cheney has proposed reducing funding for star wars by 
1 billion and shifting the focus from deployment sometime in the 
1990s to research on brilliant pebbles a more advanced system 
consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites 
in addition the report said that submarinelaunched ballistic 
missiles are the most costeffective for delivering nuclear 
warheads 
it said a possible armsreduction treaty if successfully 
negotiated will provide an opportunity to reconsider strategic 
policies and programs but it will not in itself save large 
amounts of money 
the report said such a treaty would allow current modernization 
to continue with only minor reductions in the number of 
submarines and missiles procured

oregon farmers have planted 18 percent 
less acres of strawberries this year because of fluctuations in the 
migrant work force and complications of the new federal immigration 
law 
the harvest may cover even less acreage if more migrant pickers 
dont arrive in the next few weeks for the june picking 
this is the first full year officials can measure the effects of 
the immigration reform and control act of 1986 which penalizes 
growers who hire undocumented aliens traditionally the largest 
source of harvest workers employers face fines of 500 to 10000 
for each illegal worker and can be imprisoned after three 
violations 
while the numbers of both documented and undocumented workers 
are increasing as the june strawberry harvest nears far fewer 
pickers have arrived than last year when there was a surplus of 
about 30000 who were stranded without jobs food or housing 
two years ago a shortage of workers left 20 percent of the 
strawberry crop to rot in the fields many migrant workers 
mistakenly believed then that they would lose their chance for 
legal residency if they were caught in the united states last 
year word of the previous years shortage led to the surplus 
what happens this year may largely determine the future of 
oregons strawberry crop the nations second largest after 
california 
the oregon agricultural statistical service estimates 6400 
acres have been planted in strawberries down from 7800 acres the 
past two years 
many farmers last year just decided it was not worth it to 
grow strawberries knowing that the labor situation was uncertain 
said dalton hobbs spokesman for the oregon department of 
agriculture 
oregons smaller production shouldnt have a significant impact 
on the national strawberry crop however in california the number 
of acres planted in strawberries has increased 12 percent since 
1987 to an estimated 19000 acres this year 
danny santos manager of the migrant program for the governors 
commission on agricultural labor estimated oregon will need 40000 
workers to harvest this years crop 
santos said better wages and living conditions must be provided 
to attract a stable and legal labor force 
we as a state must learn how to become more competitive in 
getting workers he said 
oregon has teamed with washington and idaho to form a regional 
recruitment task force that works to secure an adequate labor 
supply the group is working with texas officials on an exchange 
program to make use of that states large farm labor pool and give 
those workers more work santos said 
other actions include financing child care health and education 
programs and providing grants to agencies that work to secure 
better housing 
if you provide services you not only get a skilled labor 
force but a stable labor force santos said 
growers who in the past have failed to provide adequate wages 
and housing will have a tough time getting their crops harvested 
said the rev david ziegler of st alexanders roman catholic 
church in cornelius about 20 miles west of portland 
growers talk about the immigration law but they have to 
accept responsibility for workers he said 
there are going to be a lot of growers who wont get their 
crops picked said ron taylor overseer at lloydene farms near 
cornelius 
one worker eloy aguirre of mexico said he still is waiting to 
be paid for his work last year at tankersley farms in washington 
county owner ron tankersley is serving a jail sentence for using 
illegal contractors this year aguirre will work for lloydene 
david beebe district director of the us immigration and 
naturalization service office in portland said the agency will 
focus on growers who hire illegal workers not on deporting those 
without documentation 
its the difference between working hard and working smart

house speaker jim wright today attacked the 
ethics committees outside counsel accusing him of distorting 
testimony in an effort to implicate the speaker on house rules 
violations 
wright also charged that the ethics panel had permitted itself 
to be misled by counsel richard phelans selective use of evidence 
wright said his own lawyers had been profoundly shocked by the 
lack of professionalism and prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy 
contained in the phelan report and called the committees 
investigation one sided 
but committee chairman julian dixon dcalif defended the 
panels process and said its 12 members six democrats and six 
republicans had studied original transcripts and not relied solely 
on phelans report 
asked whether he was disturbed by wrights strategy of attacking 
phelan dixon said he was not but added im glad you recognize 
that that is the strategy 
at the same time wrights new legal defense team today prepared 
motions asking that the two primary charges against him be 
dismissed on grounds that the ethics committees special counsel 
has misread house rules 
a source familiar with the defense said wrights lawyers believe 
they have a good chance of thinning the 69 formal counts of alleged 
rules violations before wright faces a triallike disciplinary 
hearing before the ethics panel 
but the legal maneuvering appeared likely to further delay that 
hearing pushing it into june rather than late this month 
wright is charged with evading house limits on outside earned 
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and with improperly 
accepting some 145000 in gifts from fort worth real estate 
developer george mallick who has been deemed by the committee as 
having a direct interest in legislation before congress 
but wrights lawyers will argue that a strict reading of the 
rules permits unlimited book royalties to be collected by a house 
member they also will try to make the case that mallick helped 
wright not because of any interest in legislation but because of 
the longtime friendship between the two and that such 
relationships are protected by the rules 
they will argue that the special counsel richard j phelan 
misread the history behind the rules and brought charges when none 
were warranted phelans charges amount to a rewriting of the 
rules the defense lawyers contend 
in addition the attorneys will seek to formally isolate phelan 
from the ethics panel that employed him by arguing he now takes on 
the role of prosecutor and the committee should limit its private 
contact with him to maintain objectivity 
the hardline approach reflects the toughness of wrights new 
legal team which now includes houston trial lawyer stephen susman 
former defense secretary and democratic patriarch clark clifford 
rep robert torricelli dnj robert altman a washington 
attorney and associate of clifford and neal s manne a former 
counsel to the senate judiciary committee who is a member of 
susmans firm 
william c oldaker who has handled the case for wright thus 
far will continue to map out wrights overall legal strategy 
along with cocounsels lyn utrecht and eric kleinfeld 
wrights campaign funds are paying the legal teams bill a 
permitted practice said spokesman mark johnson 
while the legal wrangling in washington protracted reports of 
questionable financial dealings by wright proliferated 
the fort worth startelegram reported today that wrights wife 
betty did little or nothing to earn her 36000 yearly salary at 
the seattlebased pacific institute a firm which sells 
motivational programs primarily to corporate clients 
as far as im concerned betty wright during my tenure here 
did nothing said us tony french a retired army general 
who was the institutes chief operating officer from november 1987 
to may 1988 
i am not comfortable with anybody in pacific institute telling 
me they think she did a fair days work im not buying that 
an institute spokesman earlier had said mrs wright did 
followup work with corporate clients but was unable to offer 
specific examples of her work 
some of the ethics counts against wright are based on mrs 
wrights earlier receipt of an 18000ayear salary from mallick 
for which the special counsel could find little evidence that any 
work was done

the city today turned over a public housing 
project to its 3500 tenants to run themselves in the first such 
agreement in chicago 
management of the 615unit leclaire courts on the citys 
southwest side changed hands at a ceremony attended by us housing 
and urban development secretary jack kemp mayor richard m daley 
and city housing chief vincent lane 
no prolonged celebrating was planned after the signing of the 
threeyear contract the first such deal between the chicago 
housing authority and residents of a housing project 
we havent got much time theres too much work still 
ahead of us said community activist irene johnson its just 
that after six years of fighting the bureaucracy over this and 
that we cant wait to get started on our own 
in effect the residential management corporation that wrested 
control of leclaire courts from the government bureaucracy has 
inherited an entire neighborhood 
tenant management also has been undertaken in recent years in 
such cities as st louis cleveland washington and boston 
unlike many of chicagos publichousing projects leclaire 
courts is a complex of lowrise structures most of them twostory 
apartment buildings separated by wide lawns and residential streets 
tucked between huge industrial parcels leclaire and its 
residents have yet to share in the modest resurgence of jobs and 
businesses that increasing levels of airline traffic at nearby 
midway airport have brought other neighborhoods 
but tenant management could be the first step in that direction 
said lane 
empowerment is going to mean several important things to the 
people at leclaire he said 
its going to mean learning to live on a budget and headaches 
if they hire the wrong janitor the wrong accountant making the 
hard decision about throwing mrs jones son out because hes 
involved in drugs or a gang lane said 
the burden for the quality of their lives is going to fall 
squarely now on their shoulders if you see people out there 
planting grass and neighbors looking after one anothers kids 
making sure its safe kids going to job training and school 
you know plenty of good things will follow 
the push toward tenant management began in 1980 when mrs 
johnson and some other leclaire parents banded together to stop 
further deterioration of the residences but city and federal 
housing officials turned a deaf ear 
the first few times we dealt with the bureaucracy im sure 
they thought this group of poor black women from the projects 
will go away sooner or later said mrs johnson the latest in a 
long line of publichousing organizers that stretches nearly two 
decades to mildred haley in boston and through bertha gilkey in st 
louis and kimmy gray in washington 
but the longer we stood our ground the more respect we got 
and once we proved we could manage ourselves i think they started 
believing we could manage our own property 
now added mrs johnson who has lived in the 615unit 
project since it opened 22 years ago and sent three children to 
college this dream is something we can put our hands on 
with improving organizational skills the tenants began to find 
small grants from private foundations and businesses training a 
few members at a time 
by 1987 the group had applied enough pressure and impressed 
enough people to obtain city and federal approval for their plan 
during the past year they participated in joint management of the 
project receiving onthejob training as well 
its been a long long wait mrs johnson said but some 
people around here have been waiting a lifetime for some hope

the man who pioneered the use of 
electronic ankle bracelets to ease overcrowding at the county jail 
is wearing one himself these days for misuse of funds 
george gallaugher 40 brought the electronic devices to lake 
county a year ago as director of the countys department of court 
services 
the bracelets send out an electronic signal that enables 
authorities to know if a person leaves his assigned location they 
also allow jails to release nonviolent inmates and make room for 
people accused of serious crimes 
a grand jury accused gallaugher of profiting from the bracelet 
program but the charge was dropped when he pleaded guilty earlier 
this year to making personal use of about 15000 in other public 
funds 
he was sentenced to 30 days and had served 12 days on 
workrelease monday when his lawyer persuaded a judge to release 
him with a bracelet like any other prisoner

talks aimed at ending a strike at four 
copper mines broke off today just when a settlement appeared 
imminent and labor leaders blamed authorities for backing away 
from promised wage increases 
authorities had promised to grant a 50 percent wage increase 
demanded by the workers at the mines said solidarity spokeswoman 
barbara hrybacz the miners make between 118 and 176 monthly 
she said that when the union bargainers returned to negotiations 
to tell management that workers had accepted the offer 
authorities changed the offer to only a 30 percent increase 
the strike committee said it could not sign an agreement on 
behalf of the workers and talks broke off she said 
the walkout has virtually shut down polands production of 
copper a crucial export it is the biggest labor dispute since the 
solidarity trade union and the government signed a historic 
cooperative accord on april 5 
workers went on strike friday at the lubin polkowice rudna and 
sieroszowice mines near the city of lubin 200 miles southwest of 
warsaw the mines produce almost all of polands copper 
earlier the official pap news agency said a tentative accord 
was reached by negotiators during difficult allnight talks at 
the lubin mine 
a strike spokesman reached by telephone said strikers would be 
polled on the agreement and that an end to the strike was near 
the new solidarity union newspaper said 15000 miners were 
supporting the strike that has affected a total of 20000 workers 
the strike has been a test of the wideranging agreement between 
the communist government and solidarity the pact which followed 
two months of intense talks resulted in the legalization of the 
outlawed union and opposition participation in national elections 
in return solidarity is to cooperate with the government on 
economic reforms aimed at improving polands ailing economy more 
militant union splinter groups favor a more adversarial approach 
the miners strike committee included 10 members of the 
independent solidarity trade union seven from the communist 
partydominated opzz union and 13 unaffiliated miners solidarity 
said 
solidarity which was the east blocs first independent trade 
union during its brief initial legal existence was crushed during 
the martial law crackdown of december 1981 
poland exported 233 million in copper to the west in 1987

interior secretary manuel lujan promised today 
to try to help cool the controversy in wisconsin over indian 
spearfishing which has prompted emotional confrontations between 
members of the chippewa tribe and sport fishermen 
wisconsin gov tommy g thompson at a meeting with lujan asked 
that the federal government assist the state in trying to reach a 
negotiated settlement with the chippewas that might curtail the 
practice by the indians of spearfishing on land that once belonged 
to them 
the indians hold the right to spearfish on the land under 
treaties that date back more than a century but sport fishermen 
have loudly protested the practice saying the practice cuts into 
the number of fish they are allowed to catch 
protests in recent weeks resulted in scores of arrests 
lujan told the governor he will direct a senior department 
official to look into what help the federal government might 
provide he said pat ragsdale acting assistant secretary for 
indian affairs will work with the governor and the indians as to 
what specific steps might be taken spokesmen reported 
after the meeting with thompson and members of wisconsins 
congressional delegation the secretary issued a statement saying 
he will explore means by which the interior department could 
facilitate efforts to achieve an agreement with the tribes that 
would ease tensions over the spearfishing and avert future 
conflicts 
lujan provided no specific action that might lead to a 
settlement 
i dont think the tribes will want to give up spearfishing i 
really dont know what well be able to work out said one 
interior official speaking on condition that he not be identified 
further 
in addition to thompson those who attended the meeting with 
lujan were sens robert w kasten jr rwis and herbert kohl 
dwis democratic rep david obey and republican reps steve 
gunderson and toby roth 
most of this springs chippewa spearfishing had ended last 
weekend costs for protecting the chippewa may total as much as 1 
million twice as much as last year because of the larger groups 
of spearfishing opponents that gathered at boat landings used by 
the indians state officials say 
there were more than 170 arrests primarily of those who opposed 
the chippewa spearfishing that is permitted under 19th century 
treaties in some cases protesters crossed police lines en masse 
and were arrested in others they shouted obscenities or insults 
with racial overtones 
this has been a tough time in the state obey said monday 
what we need are a cooling down of tempers and a sobering up of a 
lot of people 
everyone recognizes that this is a problem that has to be a 
negotiated settlement 
he said the federal government can help the tribes focus 
themselves on what they want 
obey said indian disputes over land and fishing rights have been 
settled through negotiation in maine arizona and new york and he 
was confident the same could be done in wisconsin 
federal court decisions since 1983 upheld rights of the chippewa 
to hunt fish trap and harvest wild grain from offreservation 
lands covering about the northern third of wisconsin the treaties 
ceded that area to the united states 
opposition to tribal fishing grew this year when state officials 
decided the planned chippewa catch required cutbacks in daily catch 
limits on walleyes taken by sport fishermen from lakes where 
indians had speared 
resort owners and other business people joined spearfishing 
opponents in boatlanding demonstrations before the most active 
spearfishing band the lac du flambeau announced sunday it had 
ended the spring season 
the lac du flambeau does the most spearfishing of any of the six 
bands and accounted for more than half of the 15735 walleye that 
had been caught by the chippewa as of monday tribal spokesmen 
blamed cold spring weather for reducing the catch from the 25974 
taken last spring 
by comparison sport fishermen bagged an estimated 672000 
walleyes from the same area last year

mikhail s gorbachev accused him of being too 
ambitious and had him fired from the politburo but boris n 
yeltsin says he still talks to and believes in the kremlin 
chief 
their rocky relationship has made headlines largely because 
yeltsin one of the staunchest backers of gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness also became its victim his attacks on 
the slowness of reform and the officials he believes are 
responsible have put a dent in his political career he is only now 
recovering from 
looking fit and tan from tennis jogging and a vacation in the 
caucasus mountains the 58yearold yeltsin was as outspoken as 
ever in a recent interview 
he appeared buoyed by his landslide victory in the march 26 
parliamentary elections a win he scored despite a communist party 
reprimand a new party investigation into his views and recent 
publication of criticism of him by party officials including 
gorbachev 
yeltsin made clear his complaints about the slowness of reform 
were not directed at gorbachev but at those surrounding gorbachev 
asked about his relationship with gorbachev the silverhaired 
maverick from sverdlovsk paused 
our relations are not as close as they were when i worked the 
first year or so as first secretary of the moscow city party 
committee before that as a central committee secretary he 
finally said 
when we worked as first secretaries i of the sverdlovsk and 
he of the stavropol regional party committee we maintained normal 
human contact by phone and so forth i would not say we were 
friends but we had normal relations then he supported me and all 
but after that not without someones help a bit of a chill 
started to creep in 
now he said we meet say hello discuss things normally you 
cant say our relations are broken off no not at all 
yeltsin interviewed in his state construction committee office 
where he works as first deputy chairman said he speaks to 
gorbachev by phone and sees him at party meetings 
gorbachev has made mistakes he said declining to elaborate in 
other public statements yeltsin has said he believes the kremlin 
chief made a tactical error by not making increased supplies of 
food consumer goods and housing the top priority of 
perestroika or restructuring 
yeltsin said gorbachev is a true reformer who is unhappy that 
perestroika has not substantially improved peoples lives the 
reason yeltsin believes is that conservatives led by politburo 
member yegor k ligachev whom he refers to as my opponent 
are holding back reform 
yeltsin said some of the 10 others on the politburo are tainted 
by the legacy of the 18year rule of president leonid i brezhnev 
an era now branded the period of stagnation 
they will never say it aloud but they have been in the 
highest echelons in the stagnation zone safe from any criticism 
for so long that i doubt if half of them could restructure 
themselves and move perestroika energetically ahead yeltsin said 
gorbachev already has done some housecleaning on the ruling 
body dropping andrei a gromyko the man who ran foreign policy 
during brezhnevs rule and mikhail s solomentsev the premier of 
russia during much of the brezhnev period 
ligachev remains and yeltsin said a further shakeup is needed 
he declined to identify those he believes should be fired saying 
hed get into even more trouble with the party in march the 
policymaking central committee began investigating whether his 
views conflict with the party line 
yeltsin said the committees action in april to retire 110 
topranking party officials including many elderly holdovers from 
the brezhnev days was only a partial solution a fullscale 
central committee purge can be made only at the next communist 
party congress in 1991 and yeltsin suggested there be an 
extraordinary session to weed out more oldtimers 
yeltsin said the central committee is more conservative than the 
parliament to which he was just elected and it has made the party 
the rearguard instead of the vanguard of society the new 
parliament will include such reformers as human rights campaigner 
andrei d sakharov economist nikolai p shmelev and historian roy 
a medvedev 
in a 1987 speech that led to his ouster as moscow party boss and 
removal from the politburo yeltsin said consumers were concerned 
perestroika had given them nothing and he blasted ligachev for 
impeding reform he has railed against the privileges granted the 
soviet elite and demanded more radical economic reform 
gorbachev himself has pushed gradually for more radical reform 
and in an april 25 speech acknowledged that shortages of housing 
food and basic consumer goods are growing despite perestroika 
in a sense gorbachev is beginning to sound more and more like 
yeltsin 
asked whether he had simply aired his complaints too soon 
yeltsin responded i think he gorbachev is late moreover he is 
of the very same opinion as i am but something prevents him from 
showing himself more decisively to solve these problems 
he said later that he meant somebody was holding gorbachev 
back mentioning ligachev but declining to identify others 
last year gorbachev said he had brought yeltsin into the 
leadership in 1985 because he was an experienced energetic 
person with a critical approach but gorbachev said yeltsin 
resorted to shouting and command methods and went off into 
highflown talk statements and administrative fiat he also 
accused yeltsin of selfadmiration 
yeltsin said he was hurt by the criticism and wants the central 
committee to annul a resolution it passed in 1987 branding his 
speech politically erroneous 
it cant be called politically erroneous he said somberly 
the resolution hangs on me even now probably i will have to 
wait for 28th party congress to raise this question 
yeltsin also is angry about an investigation the central 
committee launched during his election campaign into charges he 
opposed party policies one charge was that he supported breaking 
the partys monopoly on political power yeltsin contends he has 
simply called for discussion of a multiparty system 
asked about the inquiry he snapped back that no commission 
representative has interviewed him or asked for copies of his 
speeches 
any criminal has a right to defense he said

an agriculture department official said 
tuesday that all federally inspected poultry and hog slaughtering 
plants in arkansas have been put under intensified suveillance 
for traces of the cancercausing pesticide heptachlor 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said the agency may expand testing 
into surrounding states over the next few weeks the intensified 
surveillance program for heptachlor in arkansas began on monday he 
said 
the usda agency has been monitoring arkansas slaughter plants 
since january for traces of heptachlor after finding contaminated 
poultry at townsends of arkansas in batesville he said 
we also began suveillance testing in other poultry and 
redmeat slaughtering plants in arkansas to determine if the 
heptachlor problem extended beyond townsends crawford said 
regrettably we found additional problems 
one hog tested positive for heptachlor at unacceptable levels 
and two others showed traces of the chemical meanwhile he said 
the food and drug administration reported unacceptable heptachlor 
levels in noncommerial egg samples 
contaminated feed is the suspected cause although the fda has 
not been able to determine the specific source at least four feed 
mills have been under investigation 
crawford said his agency will inform the fda whenever actual 
or potential violations are detected through our testing 
meanwhile the fda will attempt to determine who bought the 
contaminated feed after that crawford said his inspectors will 
test animals from those producers 
the problems occurring with heptachlor are disturbing he 
said heptachlor has been shown to induce tumors in mice in 
1978 the environmental protection agency banned heptachlor for all 
agricultural uses except as a seed treatment but it is apparent 
from the problems were finding now that residues from treated seed 
persist in food animals 
crawford said the problem will not be resolved until the 
practice of using chemically treated seed as animal feed is 
stopped we are very encouraged by the epa announcement that they 
will ban the future use of heptachlor on treated seed he added

the astronauts who rode the space 
shuttle atlantis on a fourday mission returned to work tuesday to 
begin reviewing their flight highlighted by the deployment of a 
planetary probe to venus 
their mission ended monday when the 97ton shuttle dropped out 
of orbit and glided to an afternoon landing at edwards air force 
base calif atlantis remained at edwards and initial inspections 
showed little damage to the thermal tiles that protect it from the 
heat of reentry 
while the astronauts returned to work the magellan probe they 
deployed in orbit where its own rocket engine was fired 
maintained a nearly perfect course for venus it will travel 806 
million miles and loop 1 times around the sun before reaching 
venus in august 1990 
nasa officials praised the five astronauts efforts in deploying 
magellan the nations first planetary probe in 11 years and the 
first ever to ride a shuttle into space 
obviously this mission was an outstanding success nasa 
science chief lennard fisk told reporters at edwards 
the astronauts commander david walker pilot ronald grabe and 
mission specialists mary cleave mark lee and norman thagard 
returned home to houston late monday and were welcomed at ellington 
field by about 200 people 
its really nice to have the mission finished and we couldnt 
have done it without you ms cleave told the crowd 
she said the astronauts had a great time and that it was good to 
know that a spacecraft was en route to venus and we were all a 
part of it 
the astronauts went to work tuesday at the johnson space center 
reviewing photographs taken during their 168millionmile journey 
on wednesday they will undergo physicals and begin discussing the 
mission in depth with nasa officials 
the only problem reported during the atlantis flight the fourth 
since shuttle flights resumed sept 29 1988 was sundays failure 
of one of four redundant computers that control the shuttles 
systems 
the crew was able to restart the computer but ground controllers 
decided not to trust it for reentry the crew abandoned other 
tasks and spent 4 hours replacing the faulty computer with a 
spare the first time that had been done in orbit 
the shuttle could land with just one computer operating 
according to nasa 
before the computer failure the astronauts worked on an 
experiment involving crystallizing a metal sample in a small 
furnace and photographed lightning and pollution on earth the 
weight of magellan and its booster rocket 45000 pounds had 
limited the number of experiments the orbiter could carry 
once magellan reaches venus it will use its high resolution 
radar to map up to 90 percent of the planets surface the 
550million mission should help scientists learn more about how 
venus evolved so differently from the earth 
images obtained by magellan are expected to show features as 
small as a football field that would be 10 times cleared than 
pictures acquired by earlier radar spacecraft

to build a chemical plant in iran that officials feared might be 
used to make poison gas authorities said tuesday

foreign ministry official said on condition of anonymity 
the swiss company krebs ag had been negotiating with iran to 
build a pesticides and fertilizer plant

agricultural chemicals using the factory for chemical weapons 
could not be ruled out the official said 
in march krebbs pulled out of a chemical plant project in egypt

the defense department said tuesday it wanted 
to see the v22 osprey aircraft project shut down in an orderly 
manner but had no intention of providing any more federal funds 
to the two contractors involved 
reiterating fridays announcement that no more money would be 
forthcoming for the project the department said the political 
outcry after defense secretary dick cheneys decision to terminate 
the program was not unexpected 
i think that if we were dealing with a real turkey here youd 
have a different situation dan howard the pentagons chief 
spokesman said tuesday but the secretary acknowledged the fact 
that this is a good program 
the decision to terminate was based on the secretarys 
judgment that the only way you can cut the budget is to cut the 
budget that means that something has to come out 
on friday the two contractors developing the plane for the 
marine corps announced they were temporarily suspending their 
threat to begin layoffs in order to pursue further negotiations 
with military officials 
the contractors bell helicopter textron inc and the boeing 
helicopter co have said they dont want to pour any more of 
their money into the v22 this year if the decision to cancel the 
program in the next fiscal year stands 
the issue of corporate money arises because the pentagon already 
has paid the two companies all the money theyre due in fiscal 1989 
and the contractors are facing overruns that total about 25 
million a month 
howard repeated tuesday that cheney intends to kill the program 
in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 but fully expects the 
contractors to complete work required under the fiscal 1989 
contract 
the pentagon spokesman said there had been some additional 
discussions with company executives but declined to elaborate 
terry arnold a bell spokesman declined comment except to say 
the contractors were still discussing the situation with pentagon 
officials 
in the meantime our status hasnt changed arnold said 
its a daybyday decision on continuing work and were still 
working right now 
the v22 osprey described by the marine corps as its most 
important weapons program is a revolutionary aircraft designed to 
take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane to do this it 
utilizes special propellers at the tip of each wing that can swivel 
upward and back 
the marine corps wants to use the planes to improve its ability 
to conduct surprise longrange amphibious assaults the first of 
the planes just recently began flight tests in texas 
cheney in fashioning a fiscal 1990 military budget to honor a 
white housecongress budget compromise two weeks ago announced 10 
billion in cuts to the original spending plan of the reagan 
administration 
in making those cuts cheney ordered the osprey program canceled 
outright saying that the pentagon simply couldnt afford the plane 
and that the marine corps could do just as well by ordering 
additional and cheaper helicopters 
the pentagon had planned to spend 259 billion on 663 ospreys 
including 13 billion in 1990 the department has already invested 
2 billion in the program over a nineyear period 
of all of cheneys budgetcutting decisions the cancelation of 
the osprey has attracted the most intense opposition on capitol 
hill the plane is built in the district of house speaker jim 
wright dtexas and enjoys widespread support among republicans 
howard said that if bell and boeing failed to complete the work 
required in the fiscal 1989 contract they could face government 
legal proceedings to recover 200 million to 300 million

an argument between a man and his wife 
apparently led to a shooting spree in which two policemen were 
killed before the suspect was killed by his son 
officers bill patterson and wayne henebry were killed by shotgun 
blasts monday night apparently when they tried to serve a warrant 
on exconvict howard polk sr of columbia authorities said 
polk 51 died later about three blocks away after his 
19yearold son used his car to pin the shotgunwielding older man 
against a pickup and then emptied a pistol at him said district 
attorney richard douglass no charges were filed against the son 
douglass said the rampage apparently resulted from an argument 
polk had with his wife 
evidently they had an altercation and she made out charges 
douglas said i assume it was some kind of assault when he found 
out about it he sent word through some means that he would get her 
and the law officers that had the warrant 
douglass said henebry and patterson had responded to a domestic 
disturbance call at the home of polks wife but polk had left by 
the time the officers arrived and they headed back to the 
courthouse 
the officers bodies were later found outside their patrol cars 
near the courthouse where they had encountered polk douglass said 
apparently both officers shot at polk when he got out of his 
truck firing his shotgun 
i believe they knew he was dangerous douglass said they 
werent trying to gun him down they were just trying to do their 
job 
he said henebry was shot in the back of his head and patterson 
was shot in the face and head 
while officers were rushing to the site of the shootings they 
received reports of a nearby disturbance he polk came back 
and went to the house where his wifes relatives live douglass 
said 
he said witnesses reported that polk stopped his truck and got 
out brandishing a shotgun at the time a member of the family 
rammed him with a car and pinned him against the truck he said 
douglass said the family member was polks son howard polk jr 
there were a number of bullet wounds in his elder polks 
body douglass said the boy said he fired all the bullets in 
his gun he said one bullet in the 9shot 22caliber pistol did 
not fire 
douglass said howard polk jr was questioned and released 
it does not look like there will be charges he said he 
made the statement to his son im going to go take care of these 
papers and then im going to take care of you 
polk had a record in marion county dating to the 1960s said 
marion county circuit clerk joe herring 
he served a prison sentence in the 1970s after pleading guilty 
to a charge of manslaughter reduced from murder in a 1971 killing 
in neighboring lamar county said chief lamar county deputy yancey

a judge today barred the city transit agency 
from raising fares on subways buses and trolleys until a higher 
court decides whether the poor got a fair chance to be heard 
common pleas judge samuel lehrer rejected a plea from the 
southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority that the agency 
would suffer irreparable financial harm if the increase didnt take 
effect thursday 
under the new fare schedule the cost of tokens which riders 
buy in bulk would go from 85 cents to 1 for the agencys 1 
million weekday rides the basic cash fare 125 since 1986 would 
not change 
septa had wanted to raise fares april 9 but community groups 
argued that the agency during public hearings did not adequately 
take into consideration the effect on the poor lehrer agreed at 
the time and blocked the increases 
today septa argued it had the right put the increases into 
effect pending a hearing june 7 in commonwealth court but lehrer 
disagreed 
septa attorney david bruton had argued that the system is losing 
60000 to 80000 a day without the increase

president bush visted a baptist day care 
center tuesday to dramatize his opposition to democraticsponsored 
legislation headed for senate action 
bush hinted that washingtons shiloh baptist church child 
development center might be denied federal help under a bill by 
sen christopher dodd dconn because of its religious 
affiliation 
a spokesman for dodd disputed the contention 
dodds measure due for senate debate later this week or next 
week would provide 25 billion to states to directly assist 
individuals and centers that provide child care 
bush has proposed a rival measure that would give assistance to 
working parents rather than to childcare providers his measure 
so far ignored by congress calls for 1000 tax credits for 
lowincome working parents for each child under age 4 
my thought is to help the parents with choice if they want to 
send a kid to this facility fine give them a little help those 
that need it the most if they want to go to some other kind of 
facility where theres no relgious reference fine let them do 
that too bush told officials of the child care center 
without mentioning it by name bush suggested the dodd bill was 
overly restrictive and leans over so far backwards on this 
separation of church and state that you just erode out the 
participation of one of the best forces in the community for 
teaching these kids values 
jason issacson a dodd spokesman insisted funds under dodds 
bill would still be available to churchaffiliated childcare 
centers which like the shiloh center did not stress religious 
education 
he said that a majority of the nations churchaffiliated day 
care centers probably fall into this category and would thus be 
eligible for the grants 
bush met briefly with a group of children attending the shiloh 
center and bantered with them 
one asked him who he was 
i am the president of the united states of america bush 
said the child looked dubious 
dont you believe that there see he said showing the 
youth his presidential tie clasp

czechoslovakia is striving for press freedom and 
does not deserve to be called an east bloc bad guy a 
czechoslovak diplomat said tuesday at a meeting to improve 
information between east and west 
ambassador dusan spacil who is based in west germany said 
western countries that criticize his countrys record on press 
rights are biased and speak from preprogrammed thinking 
canada and the united states have accused czechoslovakia and 
other east bloc participants of violating or ignoring an 
international agreement on press and other freedoms signed by 35 
nations in vienna in january 
the aim of the london forum which ends this week is to monitor 
compliance with the agreement 
whatever problems do exist dont exist only in socialist 
countries but also in western countries said spacil who is 
heading the czech delegation 
what we do consider unjust especially in the western 
information media and also during this conference were onesided 
biased views he said 
there is preprogrammed thinking this includes the fiction 
that there are good and bad socialist states according to how they 
apply perestroika and glasnost and if they dont apply it 
according to the preprogrammed thinking then they are the bad 
guys he said referring to the soviet policies of economic and 
political reforms and openness applied in varying degrees in the 
east bloc 
however spacil a former ambassador to the united states said 
he believed most delegates were cooperative and understanding 
earlier at the forum canadian ambassador william bauer compared 
the propaganda techniques and statecontrolled media of romania 
czechoslovakia bulgaria and east germany to nazi germany 
chief us delegate leonard h marks singled out the same four 
nations for criticism saying they had yet to fulfill the vienna 
agreement 
spacil said glasnost has permeated his countrys media 
newspapers carry articles criticizing official speeches they 
reprint foreign articles without commentary and are more widely 
available he said 
but he said his government could not immediately hurry into 
place all the changes needed to comply with the accord which he 
said maintains that national laws have to be respected 
we are in this process adjusting our national laws to the 
requirements of vienna spacil said 
he cited as an example that czechoslovakia is changing its rules 
to enable foreign journalists to obtain visas immediately 
beginning in the next two months

senate republican leader bob dole said tuesday 
the united states should resume significant military aid to 
contra rebels in nicaragua if the government there fails to hold 
and abide by free elections 
dole in comments to the commission on free and fair elections 
in nicaragua said he is not optimistic about balloting in 
nicaragua particularly in light of the sham of a new election 
law he said had been adopted by that nations leaders 
the commission is a privately financed group made up of three 
democrats and three republicans and established by the world 
freedom foundation headed by prominent conservative l brent 
bozell iii 
former sen gaylord nelson dwis cochairman of the 
commission said the panel hopes to establish guidelines and 
encourage the holding of free elections 
it will then be up to daniel ortega nicaraguas president 
he said if he is sincere about his commitment to holding 
elections in nicaragua early next year he can accept our work and 
use it as a guide in implementing the reforms he has promised since 
he took office in 1979 
the other cochairman curtin winsor jr ambassador to costa 
rica in the reagan administration also said the choice will 
ultimately be made by nicaraguas sandinista government i hope to 
join with my colleagues in offering them a clear blueprint for 
democratic commitment theirs will be the right to use it or 
to give their people less than they have offered them 
ortega has signed an accord with four other central american 
nations in which he promised electoral and other legal reforms to 
ensure fair general elections which are to be held in february 
last week his government rejected an opposition demand to 
negotiate further reforms 
the nicaraguan leader has been on a tour of european capitals to 
seek additional economic aid for his countrys troubled economy 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher in response 
to questions tuesday indicated the administration has been 
encouraging the europeans to hold off on such aid 
our position on assistance to the nicaraguans is well known 
we believe that economic assistance should be closely linked to 
sandinista compliance with their promises to hold free fair and 
honest elections boucher said 
dole told the commission he hopes for free elections but 
candidly i am not very optimistic 
the record so far as manifest for example in the sham of a 
new election law recently promulgated by the comandantes is 
hardly encouraging the kansas republican said 
what if next february comes and goes and there is no free 
election perhaps not even any election dole asked what if 
the sandinistas win the election through fraud or lose the 
elelction but refuse to yield power 
in that event he said i hope that we will articulate and 
implement a policy that will apply direct and effective pressure on 
the sandinistas including through the resumption of significant 
military aid to a revitalized democratic resistance 
president bush in the face of congressional resistance to 
continuing the reagan policy of military aid to the contras 
recently reached a bipartisan agreement providing for nonmilitary 
assistance subject to review by congressional committees the bush 
administration has abandoned plans to seek immediate military aid 
john silber president of boston university told the 
commission i do not see anything in the upcoming elections but 
an opportunity to delude ourselves i believe we are in a corner 
waiting for the paint to dry 
however allen weinstein president of the center for democracy 
said the nicaraguan government recognizes it is under intense 
international pressure to achieve acceptable ground rules for the 
february balloting 
the center is a washingtonbased policy institute that has been 
invited by both the nicaraguan govermnent and its opposition to 
send observers to monitor preparations for the election

government officials insist west 
germanys aggressiveness in a nato missile feud signals its hopes 
for a unified europe not an indication it plans to leave the 
western alliance 
bonn sparked major infighting with its demand for negotiations 
on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons saying nato should take up 
every opportunity for talks on disarmament 
the united states and britain say such talks can be dangerous 
because of the warsaw pacts superiority in conventional forces 
natos shortrange nuclear weapons most of which are in west 
germany act as a deterrent against possible attacks on alliance 
forces they say 
washington officials say the united states probably would be 
forced to withdraw its troops from west germany if the bonn 
government went so far as to ban shortrange nuclear weapons from 
its soil 
the feud has led some american observers to wonder whether west 
germanys insistence on pursuing a major internal battle shows a 
weakness in its commitment to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
but bonn government officials insist they remain committed to 
the western alliance and that disarmament negotiations help reduce 
tensions between east and west and present no threat to nato 
alfred dregger parliamentary leader of chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democratic union said reducing armaments in europe to 
the lowest levels would help make it possible for east and west 
to lose the fear they have of one another 
this is the grand goal that guides us unity and freedom for 
all of germany in a united free europe from poland to portugal a 
europe that would serve as a peace bridge between the united states 
and the soviet union dregger told parliament tuesday 
another christian democrat who asked not to be further 
identified said fears that west germany plans to abandon the 
alliance stem at least partially from a sharp lack of understanding 
in the united states of the situation in europe 
we have to do a lot to have a better understanding of whats 
going on in europe and in germany said the official 
it is very clear that we germans are working for common 
security in the western alliance and on the basis of common 
security we are looking for dialogue and better relations with the 
east 
nevertheless even some west german political analysts say kohl 
made a colossal error by insisting on a fight with the united 
states and britain over shortrange nuclear weapons 
thomas ender a specialist at bonns german institute for 
foreign affairs think tank said he fears bonns eagerness to 
please voters could seriously damage the alliance 
chancellor kohl is tempted to confront the united states 
because that may please the voters since it makes him look 
strong ender said in an interview but i am worried this could 
lead to a major break within nato 
there is a strong antimilitary mood in west germany a factor 
which apparently prompted kohl to target shortrange nuclear 
missiles in the face of predictions he could lose next years 
election 
this is a very narrowminded and dangerous game to be playing 
the utmost west german national interest is to keep a strong 
alliance with the united states ender said 
the conservative newspaper die welt on tuesday echoed enders 
worry saying it is a serious mistake for west germany to 
attempt to pit other continental european allies against the united 
states and britain in the missiles dispute 
kohls government often claims the support of six continental 
european nato allies in its attempt to persuade washington and 
whitehall of the need for disarmament talks 
die welt said only time will tell whether the nato feud is 
the start of a distancing between north america and western 
europe between britain and the continent

the government paid the first monthly 
benefit tuesday to the heirs of more than 2000 adults who died in 
the 1984 bhopal gas disaster as ordered by the supreme court 
government funds are being used pending resolution of legal 
challenges to a 470 million settlement by union carbide corp of 
danbury conn an indian subsidiary of union carbide operated the 
bhopal plant 
bank accounts opened in the names of the heirs were credited 
with the first monthly payments of 750 rupees 50 each 
members of the bhopal gas affected womens organization held a 
silent demonstration outside a building where officials presented 
the heirs with bank documents 
protesters carried placards and banners accusing the government 
of trying to take credit for the compensation program 
abdul jabbar khan organizer of the group said we want to 
tell the victims that it is because of the supreme court and not 
the munificence of the government that they are getting the money 
there was no need to hold such a function this only shows the 
government wants to use the occasion for electoral purposes 
at least 3400 people were killed and more than 20000 injured 
when toxic gas leaked from the bhopal pesticide plant on dec 2 
1984 
union carbide was ordered in february to pay 470 million under 
a settlement supervised by the supreme court during the hearing of 
a 3 billion damage suit filed by the government 
payment was delayed after several petitions challenged the 
governments right to represent the victims 
another bench of the court ordered monthly payment of interim 
relief pending a decision on the legal petitions the amount paid 
is to be deducted from the final compensation award

the us electronics industry on tuesday 
released a plan proposing more than 13 billion in government aid 
to help america catch up in the global race to develop 
highdefinition television technology 
but commerce secretary robert mosbacher said us manufacturers 
shouldnt depend on uncle sam to be their uncle sugar in 
bankrolling the effort 
highdefinition television which offers the promise of sharper 
brighter and wider pictures is expected to be in full operation in 
japan by the mid1990s the us telecommunications industry has 
barely begun testing the technology 
pat hill hubbard vice president of the american electronics 
association told a senate committee that if the united states 
fails to catch up the effects on our economy may be drastic 
and would adversely affect a range of industries including 
semiconductors software and automated manufacturing equipment 
we must gain an industry to retain many industries she said 
the association released a proposal developed by the boston 
consulting group that calls for 1 billion in loans and loan 
guarantees for us companies that join together to manufacture and 
market the television technology 
the plan also proposes 300 million over three years to promote 
highdefinition tv research at the pentagon and 50 million more 
for related work at the commerce department the proposal calls for 
matching investments and initiatives from interested businesses 
mosbacher testifying earlier said the bush administration had 
not yet decided on its role in fostering the new technology but 
said he had serious doubts about throwing money at the problem 
i think frankly the problem is that they are hoping 
uncle sugar will fund it and i dont think they should depend on 
that mosbacher said its got to be that the private sector 
will still take the lead 
mosbacher reiterated his previous statements that the 
administration hopes to promote americas industrial 
competitiveness by extending research and development tax credits 
and reducing the capital gains tax rate 
he also said the administration is considering easing antitrust 
restrictions to allow us companies to work together to develop 
new technologies 
ibm corp vice chairman jd kuehler said the core question 
related to development of highdefinition television is whether 
or not this country wants to get into the development and the 
manufacturing of consumer electronics now largely the territory 
of japanese companies 
hdtv has become the symbol of or the last bastion of or the 
best opportunity to put this country into the role of a 
provider of consumer electronics kuehler said 
the committee chairman sen ernest f hollings dsc said he 
was embarrassed for mosbacher because of his lack of specific 
recommendations for advancing hdtv and us industrial 
competitiveness 
hollings praised the hdtv proposal released by the electronics 
association and said the suggested amounts of government assistance 
included in the plan were in the ballpark given the head start 
that the japanese have in hdtv technology

a report alleging that two private animal 
welfare groups used the oregon humane societys shelter to kill 
thousands of trapped stray dogs and cats has shocked the societys 
board and angered pet owners 
the report was made public saturday the day before national 
be kind to animals week began 
the report also contended animals were neglected and abused at 
the shelter that poor records were kept and that large amounts of 
sodium pentabarbital the lethal compound used to euthanize 
animals were missing 
the societys board had no idea humane society president 
dolorosa margulis said it was an absolutely outrageous shock 
the humane societys executive director patrick e sweeney and 
general manager alan thomas were fired after consultant brad 
quinn post submitted the report 
sweeney has declined to comment thomas has not returned phone 
calls 
the practice of trapping and killing strays became so widespread 
that forms designed for detailed information from one pet owner 
often listed as many as 44 unspecified animals or said simply 21 
collies or 12 labradors according to the report 
there is no basis for knowing retrospectively how many if 
any of these animals were in fact missing with owners perhaps 
frantically looking for their pets post wrote 
humane society board members said the two animal welfare groups 
animal aid inc and citizens for humane education had trapped 
and killed as many as 32000 animals 80 percent of them cats at 
the shelter since 1981 
not any member of the board knew this was going on margulis 
said 
however she discounted that pets could easily have been among 
the trapped animals 
you very easily can distinguish a wild cat that is 
malnourished from a cat thats a pet and just lost margulis 
said a feral cat is a very mean cat 
we have a cat crisis in the county said mike oswald head 
of multnomah county animal control he said the blame for the high 
number of animals killed rests with pet owners who fail to spay or 
neuter their cats 
he said the county has about 125000 cats and 561000 people 
only 3 percent of the cats are licensed and the rest are the 
property of casual owners who let them run loose oswald said 
oswald said he didnt know why so many animals were killed at 
the humane society and not taken to the county shelter most 
probably would have been put to death at the county shelter as 
well but the county also has strict regulations on proof of 
ownership before an animal is killed 
animal aid and citizens for humane education issued a statement 
saying they had worked openly with the humane society and that they 
trapped only stray animals that never had a home 
margulis denied that the two groups had worked openly together 
but she did praise animal aid for its local lostandfound hotline 
which reunites pets with their owners 
posts report also pointed out that the humane society manager 
had created no written procedures for shelter operations post laid 
partial blame on the board of trustees which he said had also 
failed to develop clearcut directives or mandates that management 
could meaningfully employ 
although they had no veterinary training post said staffers 
appeared confident about their ability to diagnose illnesses 
animals are routinely euthanized because of slight coughs or 
occasional sneezing without any other overt indications of 
disease he said and also charged that animals were killed 
simply for having ear mites

boucher said winners will be chosen by a computer which will 
make the selections on a random basis 
citizens from 162 countries were eligible to apply during march 
and all applicants have an equal chance of winning an immigrant 
visa 
rep howard berman dcalif author of the legislation that 
made the new program possible will open the first few 
application envelopes selected by the computer and announce the 
nationalities of the applicants at a ceremony monday boucher 
said 
he will be the first person to match the computer numbers with 
the application envelopes said frances jones an official with 
the departments counsular affairs office 
only the nationalities and not the names will be announced at 
the ceremony as a courtesy to the privacy of the applicants 
ms jones said 
those who do win a visa and come to the united states could 
apply for citizenship later if they meet the strict criteria for 
that status ms jones added 
under the program 10000 visas will be granted each year for 
1991 and 1992 
berman said the program would bring diversity to the immigrant 
population 
under the normal rules for obtaining an immigrant visa the 
applicant has to have a close relative in the united states or work 
in a scarce profession 
the program touched off a neartempest at posts around the 
world primarily because it opened the way for nearly anyone to 
come the united states 
since the program was announced in february us embassies and 
diplomatic posts overseas were besieged with queries 
telephones rang constantly and embassy entry ways were snarled 
at posts ranging from cairo egypt to bucharest romania as 
people lined up for information 
but winning the lottery doesnt automatically gain applicants 
entry they must also meet the basic requirements for entry such 
as good health and no criminal contacts 
the last lottery for visas was held in 1986 it was more 
restrictive than the current program and allowed only 10000 visas 
with some 14 million applicants losing out 
the countries excluded from the program were those that used 
more than 5000 immigrant slots in fiscal 1988 
they were china colombia dominican republic el salvador 
guyana haiti india jamaica south korea mexico the philippines 
and the united kingdom 
also excluded were natives of taiwan anguilla bermuda british 
virgin islands cayman islands falkland islands gibraltar hong 
kong monteserrat pitcairn st helena and the turks and caicos 
islands

lech walesa went to a steel mill where his 
agreements with communist authorities were criticized and told 400 
workers in a packed hall tuesday we have a chance to make the 
poland of our dreams 
the solidarity leader said unity is needed if opposition 
candidates are to win national assembly seats in next months 
elections which will be partially free 
also on wednesday talks to settle a 5dayold strike at four 
copper mines broke down and miners accused management of backing 
down from pay promises the solidarity information service reported 
barbara hrybacz a solidarity spokeswoman said the strike had 
appeared near an end tuesday morning when a management offer of a 
50 percent increase after 11 hours of talks satisfied strikers 
original demands 
government ministers told the miners later that authorities 
could not favor one sector by granting their pay demands and 
appealed for an end to the strike state tv reported 
workers in the hall at the huta warszawa steel plant grilled 
walesa for over an hour about the elections union policy and the 
copper strikes 
a solidarity splinter group led seweryn jaworski of huta 
warszawa has urged a boycott of the elections on grounds they are 
not completely free 
on tuesday however jaworski sat on the speakers platform with 
walesa advisers jacek kuron and bronislaw geremek and zbigniew 
bujak solidarity leader of the warsaw region 
we have a chance to make the poland of our dreams walesa 
declared today we have all the opportunities there is a 
terrible struggle ahead of us so we have to get to work 
i would like to hear the problems that hurt you i came 
here to be wiser i would like to be directed by you he said in 
brief introductory remarks 
the first questioner shouted at walesa how can you be sure 
that we will have completely free elections in four years 
he replied we cant be sure where is our certainty it is 
written at the round table my question is whether we will take 
advantage of it our purpose is to get full democratic elections in 
the next term 
his reference was to the round table agreements concluded 
with the government april 5 that legalized solidarity after a 
sevenyar ban and provide for the elections in june

solidarity congress for guidance in negotiations with the 
government and he responded there was no time for democracy i

the environmental group greenpeace accused the 
agriculture department on tuesday of failing to ensure that milk 
provided in its school lunch program is free of the cancercausing 
chemical dioxin 
the group has asked for a meeting as soon as possible with 
officials of the departments food and nutrition service which 
turned down an earlier greenpeace petition to require that milk 
cartons used in the school lunch programs be made of material that 
wont put dioxin in the milk 
gene vincent an agriculture department spokesman said 
officials scheduled a department meeting on the subject later in 
the day 
greenpeace contends a canadian government study shows paper milk 
cartons made of paper bleached with chlorine can contain trace 
amounts of dioxin the most powerful cause of cancer ever tested in 
laboratory animals 
they have basically disparaged scientific findings janet 
hieber of greenpeace told a news conference she signed the groups 
letter to geroge a braley deputy administrator for special 
nutrition programs asking for a meeting 
newly available scientific information shows that milk 
packaged in chlorinebleached cartons poses a clear health threat 
to children because these bleached cartons are contaminated with 
dioxin that migrates into the childrens milk she wrote 
on feb 13 greenpeace petitioned the department to start a 
formal rulemaking proceeding to forbid bleached cartons for the 
nearly 5 billion halfpoints of milk that usda pays for each year 
under five programs it also asked temporary regulations to require 
milk be provided in unbleached cartons returnable glass bottles or 
the like 
in response braley said further study of the canadian tests is 
necessary and studies are being conducted by both the environmental 
protection agency and the food and drug administration 
braley said that to take greenpeaces action without further 
studies would be extremely disruptive and alternative halfpint 
containers for milk in glass or containers bleached without using 
chlorine were not available 
ms hieber was asked how much milk a child would have to drink 
from the current packaging to be harmed 
from what we have seen in animal testing even drinking a 
carton a day is unhealthy she said 
we have not found any amount that is not toxic most of the 
effects are latent you wont see the effects for 10 to 20 
years maybe 30 years 
she said alternative bleaching methods are available that wont 
leach dioxin into milk 
asked what parents might do she replied write to legislators 
the secretary of agriculture in essence you have no choice as 
parents i think parents should definitely be talking to their 
school boards about this

the communist party central committee 
accused ousted leader janos kadar of making wrong decisions that 
hampered the nations political and economic progress official 
media reported tuesday 
the official mti news agency on tuesday released the message 
sent to kadar by the central committee which stripped him of his 
last official posts on monday 
the message said history would be the best judge of kadars 32 
years as party leader 
kadar 76 was removed as hungarian leader last year and 
replaced by karoly grosz who has allowed more personal freedoms 
and political reforms 
today we cannot undertake to assess your 50year historic 
career which is inseparably linked with the advancement not free 
of contradictions of the hungarian nation mti quoted the 
message to kadar as saying 
in the final anaysis only posterity can complete a balance 
sheet of an era which is linked to the name of janos kadar 
informing kadar that he was being removed from the powerful 
central committee and the honorary post of party president the 
party leadership said the objective difficulties of the past 15 
years and our economic and political woes have been aggravated by 
erroneous decisions which were taken on more than one occasion 
in a clear break with the former leader the central committee 
stated we cannot underestimate our achievements but we cannot 
keep silent about our errors either 
foreign ministerdesignate gyula horn also criticized kadar who 
became party leader as soviet troops and tanks crushed an 
antisoviet revolt in 1956 
we must not gloss over the fact that grave errors were also 
committed during that period the impact of which are felt today 
horn said on staterun tv the socalled years of stagnation are 
also linked to kadars name 
kadar has come under increasing criticism in official media for 
his role in postwar purges and allegedly in the arrest and 
execution in 1958 of revolutionary premier imre nagy and several of 
his associates 
kadar has also been indirectly blamed for the downward slide in 
recent years of the national economy once a model of prosperity in 
the socialist world 
hungary is saddled with a 17 billion foreign debt inflation 
expected to top 16 percent this year and sharply declining living 
standards 
a party official who addressed a news conference said kadar was 
sent into retirement for health reasons 
party secretary gyoergy fejti told reporters the central 
committee noted with sadness that the health of chairman kadar does 
not allow him to fulfill his functions and therefore decided to 
release him 
fejti said the central committee letter expressed respect and 
esteem for kadars contributions 
we are sure that both history and public opinion will see this 
period as a progressive one despite the shortcomings said fejti 
he would not divulge details about kadars health 
budapests kossuth radio reported in a noon broadcast that kadar 
spoke incoherently during the last central committee meeting two 
weeks ago 
fejti also discussed the ruling partys efforts to set up a 
national round table to negotiate with newly formed opposition 
groups on the transition to a multiparty system and methods of 
reversing the economic crisis

president bush remains committed to convening 
an international environmental conference his spokesman said 
tuesday while administration officials disagree on whether to hold 
a meeting geared toward a treaty on global warming 
bush discussed his desire for a global environmental conference 
which would focus on global warming and other issues during a 
meeting with dutch prime minister ruud lubbers said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
that conference would be different than a socalled framework 
convention that some in the administration are pushing as a way to 
get an accord in the works the accord would seek agreement by 
nations on curbing practices leading to the worlds climactic 
warming trend 
the environmental conference bush wants would be more general 
and could focus on discussing various issues said nancy maloley 
associate director of the office of policy development she said 
the global warming framework convention has not been ruled out 
however some presidential advisers including environmental 
protection agency administrator william reilly wanted the united 
states to make a formal diplomatic overture this week at an 
internatinal meeting in geneva to get the ball rolling on a global 
warming convention 
the idea was dropped by the white house as being premature 
because the administration has not yet decided its policy on global 
warming in which emissions from burning of fossil fuels is said to 
be increasing the worlds temperature 
developing that position involves taking into account the impact 
on many sectors of the country including the agricultural and oil 
industries and the cost to the government of measures to deal with 
the problems 
fitzwater said bush who promised during his presidential 
campaign to convene an environmental conference does not have a 
time for that conference 
his environmental advisers are currently looking at various 
formulations for such a meeting and he will discuss it with allied 
leaders later in the year fitzwater said 
bush said the conference would be at the expert level and 
would be designed to utilize the considerable environmental talent 
in the united states fitzwater 
officials say the government is not ready to begin moving toward 
a controversial convention on global warming because it would 
involve so many segments of the administration in addition to the 
scientific advisers 
earlier this week nasa scientist james e hansen complained 
that the office of management and budget had altered his 
conclusions on global warming to soften his predictions of dire 
consequences from the trend the white house said the changes were 
to reflect that not all scientists and analysts within the 
administration agree that the results will be so dramatic

north korea called tuesday for the 
united states to remove nuclear weapons from the korean peninsula 
saying they pose a threat of nuclear war 
the united states dismissed the call as repetitious 
propaganda 
maj gen choe ui ung a north korean spokesman urged the 
creation of a nuclearfree zone at a meeting of the military 
armistice commission overseeing the ceasefire that ended the 
bitter 195053 korean war 
in light of the international trend to remove the danger of 
nuclear war we have presented the issue of removing the nuclear 
weapons at this meeting he said 
us navy rear adm larry g vogt welcomed north koreas call 
for the meeting but said the nuclear charges were repetitious 
propaganda to weaken south korea and its allies he was speaking 
for the 16 nations that aided seoul in the korean war 
vogt did not respond directly to choes charges that the united 
states is storing nuclear weapons in south korea as part of war 
preparations 
instead the american suggested the commission discuss steps to 
ease tension such as the restoration of joint observer teams to 
investigate alleged armistice violations and the return of remains 
of soldiers killed in the war 
the creation of a nuclearfree zone was a political issue 
out of the purview of the command vogt said 
the united states declines to confirm or deny if it has nuclear 
weapons in south korea past reports indicate us forces are 
equipped with some tactical nuclear weapons 
choe said us nuclear arms in south korea include artillery 
shells warheads for missiles mines bombs and said two nuclear 
airfields are under construction 
it is not only a hypocrisy but also a deception of the public 
opinion that you talk about the nuclear disarmament while keeping 
nuclear weapons in south korea the most dangerous hotbed of 
nuclear war in the world he said 
south korean officials said the meeting marked the first time in 
recent memory that the pyongyang government offered an agenda in 
advance they said it also was the first time north korea focused 
on one topic 
north korea which invaded south korea in 1950 repeatedly uses 
the commission to call for the removal of us forces from the 
peninsula south korea says the 42000 us troops are vital to 
prevent another communist attack

greater demand not job burnout is the major 
cause of the nationwide nursing shortage according to a twoyear 
study released tuesday 
despite widespread beliefs to the contrary it is simply not 
true that large numbers of nurses are being driven out of nursing 
by their working conditions by a lack of respect from doctors or 
indeed by anything else said the commonwealth fund a foundation 
whose goal is improving health care 
the study said only 6 percent of the people holding nursing 
licenses are working outside the profession 
instead a key explanation for the shortage is the steady 
growth in demand for nurses by hospitals which employ about 
twothirds of all working nurses 
demand has jumped because doctors now aggressively treat or 
operate upon very ill patients whom a few years ago they would not 
have subjected to such extensive intervention it said 
forty percent of all hospital nurses work in intensive care 
units which need four to six times more nurses per bed than other 
medical and surgical units 
the number of working nurses jumped from 750000 in 1970 to 162 
million in 1988 still an average of 154 percent of all budgeted 
nursing positions in hospitals are now vacant 
medicine today is not what medicine was 20 years ago thats 
the crucial point said eli ginzberg a columbia university 
economics professor and health policy specialist who participated 
in the study 
while hospitals historically have shown a reluctance to 
innovate these surveyors sensed people believing that business 
as usual wasnt going to do it any more said marc roberts a 
professor at the harvard school of public health 
the survey questioned 15000 nurses and 400 hospitals in new 
york boston pittsburgh chicago houston and los angeles 
entrylevel nurse salaries ranged from 20000 to 28000 and 
peaked between 30000 and 40000 
todays hospital nurses primarily are married women in their 30s 
and 40s with schoolaged children 
asked what were very important among their concerns 51 percent 
of fulltime nurses listed scheduling 48 percent salary and 40 
percent benefits 
nursing school enrollments have declined partly due to a 
shrinking workage force and partly due to increased career options 
for women while some men are being recruited 97 percent of all 
nurses still are women 
the study said state governments should help nursing schools 
recruit recent college graduates displaced workers lowincome 
people and members of minority groups scholarships loans and 
workstudy programs also were recommended

a un survey says people around the world no 
matter their economic standing or education are acutely worried 
about environmental problems and believe pollution will get worse 
before it gets better 
the survey was conducted by louis harris and associates for the 
united nations environment program the organizations lead agency 
for dealing with environmental matters it was released tuesday in 
washington and in nairobi kenya where the agency has its 
headquarters 
at a news conference louis harris said the findings are 
nothing less than an alarm about the state of the environment 
and indicate environmental concerns will play an increasingly 
important political role in the next decade 
i think in the next five years governments will topple because 
of the environmental issues he said 
according to the polls more than 75 percent of the people in 
each of the countries surveyed believed that stronger government 
action was needed to protect against pollution governments 
generally were given poor to mediocre grades on dealing with 
environmental matters 
in all but one of the countries saudi arabia most people 
rated their environment as only fair or poor and in all of the 
countries surveyed a majority said they would be willing to pay 
higher taxes if they knew the money would be spent on environmental 
protection 
the survey in 14 countries was conducted last year and a shorter 
version was conducted in the united states in april between 400 
and 1253 people were interviewed in each of the nations on 
subjects ranging from their view of the environment to whether they 
thought the government was doing enough to protect it 
the foreign countries were argentina china hungary india 
jamaica japan kenya mexico nigeria norway saudi arabia 
senegal west germany and zimbabwe 
large majorities in each of the countries said they perceive a 
direct link between environmental quality and public health 
the surveys revealed broad concern about the quality of drinking 
water chemical pollution of the air as well as lakes and rivers 
loss of agricultural lands and forests and disposal of toxic 
wastes 
only tiny minorities in any nation surveyed believed their 
environmental laws were too strict said the united nations 
agency 
in the united states 64 percent of those interviewed gave the 
environment a fair or poor rating that was mild however compared 
to the responses to a similar question posed in seven other 
countries more than 80 percent of the respondents in hungary 
senegal mexico china west germany india and japan gave a 
similar assessment 
water and air pollution most often were cited as posing the most 
concern 
people in countries that are still moving toward 
industrialization often expressed the greatest concern about air 
pollution while only 23 percent of the japanese surveyed held such 
concerns despite that nations enormous industrial concentration 
the survey said 
in all of the countries there was fear that environmental 
problems will likely become worse 
even in saudi arabia the only country where todays environment 
received a positive mark 61 percent of those surveyed said the 
environment will get worse nine out of 10 people in argentina said 
the environment will deteriorate the most pessimistic view in all 
of the nations in the survey

the house put itself on record on tuesday as 
favoring added muscle for the nations antidrug efforts and 
opposing an increase in the tax on gasoline to help cut the federal 
deficit 
lawmakers voted 39710 to call on housesenate negotiators to 
alter the proposed fiscal 1990 budget by transfering 100 million 
from the account that pays for congressional mailings to law 
enforcement initiatives 
bargaining between the two chambers over a 12 trillion 
spending plan for next year is set to begin wednesday 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the house 
budget committee proposed the nonbinding measure saying that 
fears that more money needed to be diverted to antidrug programs 
seemed to plague many lawmakers 
the section of the budget containing money for law enforcement 
and the portion covering general government expenses such as 
congressional mailings each contain about 10 billion for next 
year 
the housepassed measure also included language urging the 
chambers negotiators to oppose a boost in the 91centpergallon 
federal tax on gasoline 
on a voice vote the senate put itself on record last week as 
being against such an increase administration officials have 
reportedly considered consenting to such an increase for fiscal 
1991 which begins oct 1 1990 in exchange for a cut in the 
capital gains tax 
house and senate budget writers are hoping their efforts to 
agree to a compromise budget will last only a few days the two 
spending plans differ little mainly because of a pact between 
congressional leaders and the bush administration that set overall 
spending and taxing figures and laid out 28 billion in claimed 
deficit reduction 
on another front leaders of the house appropriations committee 
are still trying to rework the 47 billion domestic spending bill 
for this year that the house defeated two weeks ago 
efforts to pare the bill down in size have run into objections 
from rep neal smith diowa chairman of the appropriations 
justice subcommittee he has continued to insist that much of the 
750 million for antidrug initiatives in the original measure 
should remain intact 
republicans and some democrats have said the measure is too 
expensive the portion of the bill that members say is most 
urgently needed is 340 million for veterans health programs an 
account that could run out of money by memorial day

the lesson of the runaway exxon valdez oil spill 
is that getting people and equipment to the scene quickly is 
crucial an alaska environmental official told colleagues from the 
pacific northwest on tuesday 
one thing we learned if the right equipment isnt brought to 
bear quickly to contain the pill youre going to be chasing it 
forever said jeff mach a cleanup coordinator with alaskas 
environmental conservation department 
mach addressed the first meeting of the oil spill task force 
since the exxon valdez ran aground march 24 in alaskas prince 
william sound spilling 101 million gallons of crude and fouling 
more than 600 miles of wildliferich coast 
washington and british columbia created the task force after a 
barge spilled 270000 gallons of fuel oil in the pacific in 
december fouling the coast oregon and alaska were invited to join 
after the exxon accident 
members of the group tuesday set about the task of working more 
closely to prevent spills and clean them up more effectively they 
outlined four areas 
taking stock of what cleanup equipment is available and 
developing a plan for dispatching it to the site of a spill 
sharing information on procedures laws and mechanisms to 
recover costs from polluters 
sharing technology 
improving spill prevention the adequacy of coast guard radar 
coverage of shipping lanes and guidelines for crew training 
this is a case of forgetting about jurisdiction and dealing 
with whos got what kind of capabilities british columbias 
resources are at risk and wed like to have a looksee at how well 
prepared everybody is said rick wilson of the provinces 
ministry of environment 
christine gregoire head of washingtons department of ecology 
said the time was right for such an effort 
the congressional delegation is interested the legislature is 
interested and has oilspill bills to deal with theres even a 
citizens initiative in the works she said 
gregoire said a variety of changes are needed to enhance the 
safety of shipping products like oil foremost was increasing the 
liability of shippers she said 
one of the immediate concerns of the task force is exxons plan 
to move the crippled tanker to portland ore for repairs 
richard dalon deputy minister of british columbias ministry of 
environment said a consultant for the province concluded the 
tanker was structurally sound to make the trip if seas are 
relatively calm however the consultant olaf hatlen reported 
holes as large as 20 feet across in the bottom of the hull and a 
crack that extends nearly halfway across the hull

house speaker jim wright on tuesday accused 
the ethics committees special outside counsel of distorting 
testimony in an effort to implicate him in house rules violations 
but committee members dismissed the charge as a defense gambit 
at the same time the ethics panel faced a possible expansion of 
its investigation of the speaker requesting court records from a 
texas fraud trial where wrights name has surfaced and scheduling a 
meeting for wednesday to decide whether to pursue a gas drilling 
venture that proved lucrative to wright 
wrights new eightmember legal defense team filed a series of 
motions with the ethic committee asking for access to committee 
documents and witnesses and seeking to bar private contact between 
the panel and its outside counsel chicago lawyer richard j phelan 
other motions were being prepared asking that the most serious 
charges against wright be dismissed because they are based on 
faulty reading of house rules 
i think mr wright will be totally cleared in any fair trial 
before his peers said stephen d susman a houston lawyer 
brought in to bolster the speakers defense team 
in a blunt attack on phelan wright said his attorneys have 
been profoundly shocked by the lack of professionalism and 
prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy contained in the phelan 
report and called the committees investigation onesided 
he also said the 12 ethics committee members attended few 
interviews of witnesses it has rendered them totally dependent 
on mr phelans interpretation and his summary of the 
investigation wright said 
and on one issue whether his wife betty earned the 
18000ayear salary she was paid by fort worth developer george 
mallick from 1979 through 1984 phelan ignored testimony of 
another mallick employee and concluded mrs wright worked only 12 
days in four years wright said 
thats a lie a falsehood a distortion and a 
misrepresentation of the testimony that was given he charged 
but committee chairman julian dixon dcalif and other panel 
members said wright was wrong in contending phelan had misled the 
committee 
im very proud of the way they the panel have conducted 
themselves and thoroughly digested everything made available to 
them dixon said 
asked whether he was disturbed by wrights strategy of attacking 
phelan dixon said he was not but added im glad you recognize 
that that is the strategy 
panel member rep larry craig ridaho said he had personally 
sat in on more than 50 hours of depositions and said most committee 
members had read all or nearly of the interview transcripts 
compiled during the investigation 
to charge that mr phelan has distorted this is to assume the 
committee hasnt done its homework craig said i think the 
committee has done its homework very well 
the panel scheduled a meeting for wednesday to discuss whether 
to pursue a flurry of additional charges surrounding wright 
including whether the speaker improperly benefited last year from a 
gasdrilling venture in sabine lake that yielded him a quick 
170000 in profits 
a source familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition 
of anonymity also said the committee has asked for transcripts and 
exhibits from a criminal fraud trial in dallas in which wrights 
name showed up in the corner of a 1000 check given as a 
contribution in 1985 to a political action committee by the wife of 
a savings and loan executive 
although wright is not directly involved in the trial it raises 
again the issue of whether he tried to exert improper influence on 
behalf of the sampl industry the ethics committee already has looked 
at similar questions but did not bring charges 
we just cant get our platter cleared off before more is piled 
onto it said rep john t myers of indiana the panels senior 
republican 
wrights defense team meanwhile was seeking to reduce the 69 
formal counts of alleged rules violations before the speaker goes 
to a triallike disciplinary hearing before the ethics panel 
probably next month 
wright is charged with evading house limits on outside earned 
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and with improperly 
accepting some 145000 in gifts from mallick who has been deemed 
by the committee as having a direct interest in legislation before 
congress 
but wrights attorneys argued that a strict reading of the rules 
permits unlimited book royalties to be collected by a house member 
they also sought to make the case that mallick had no direct 
interest in legislation as defined by the rules and that therefore 
any gifts from him to the wrights would be acceptable 
they contended phelan misread the history behind the rules and 
brought charges when none were warranted phelans charges amount 
to a rewriting of the rules the defense lawyers said 
tuesdays motions included an effort to formally isolate phelan 
from the ethics panel by arguing he now takes on the role of 
prosecutor and the committee should therefore limit its private 
contact with him to maintain objectivity 
the motions all must be ruled on by the ethics committee

the national housing conference said tuesday 
that the nation faces the loss of hundreds of thousands of 
federally assisted housing units and urged a 10 billionayear 
program to preserve and produce housing for low and 
moderateincome families 
the conference a nonprofit organization of civic leaders and 
leaders of the housing industry said the inventory of federally 
assisted housing units is declining because of several factors and 
that no federal program is in place to replace lost housing 
john simon president of the group said at a news conference 
that the nation faces the imminent and longterm loss of between 
200000 and 12 million units of subsidized housing 
in calling for new federal spending he said congress and the 
administration have shown a willingness to spend massive amounts to 
bail out the savings and loan industry and provide agricultural 
subsidies and should do the same for affordable housing 
we think money can also be found and must be found to house 
our people he said 
if the loss in housing occurs simon said there would be 
massive displacement of poor and lowincome tenants and the 
working poor and a dramatic increase in the number of homeless 
families 
simon and other conference leaders said the problem is being 
created by the termination or expiration of federal subsidy 
contracts for housing projects the loss of assisted housing and 
public housing due to deterioration and inadequate maintenance and 
the prepayment of mortgages on privately owned subsidized housing 
the end of mortgages and subsidy contracts permit private owners 
of federally assisted housing to convert the housing to marketrate 
rental units or condominiums he said 
he said housing officials have stated such a wide estimate of 
potential housing losses because they do not know how private 
owners and developers will react when their subsidy contracts 
expire 
simon said the organization was asking for 10 billion yearly 
increases for several years in spending on housing programs 
he said the money should be used to provide new incentives 
including tax benefits and subsidies to induce owners to keep 
projects in the assisted housing inventory he said money should 
also be spent to create new subsidized housing and to create a 
trust fund to aid firsttime home buyers 
the national housing conference which concluded a twoday 
meeting was created in 1931 and is the oldest national housing 
organization

the labor party battling to broaden its appeal 
after a decade in opposition on tuesday dumped its votelosing 
doctrine of unilateral nuclear disarmament 
urged on by party leader neil kinnock labors national 
executive voted 178 for a new policy of multilateralism under 
which a laborled government would scrap britains independent 
nuclear arsenal only in a negotiated arms control deal 
a 169 vote defeated a motion by the hardline left to set a 
deadline for scrapping britains submarinebased nuclear missiles 
unilaterally 
the national executive adopted an unopposed amendment whereby a 
labor government would negotiate nuclear disarmament with the 
soviet union if ussoviet negotiations stalled 
but the executive also adopted unopposed a resolution saying 
nuclear weapons are not a deterrent and of no practical use 
the governing conservative party contended this is tantamount to 
saying a labor government would never use nuclear arms 
labor leftwingers accused their party of betraying its 
principles and vowed to fight to reverse the new policy at the 
partys annual convention in october which must approve the policy 
changes 
the shift is part of a wideranging policy review designed to 
draw labor back to the political center and kill the public 
perception of a party in thrall to doctrinaire leftwingers 
arguing passionately against unilateralism kinnock told his 
colleagues he had tried out the doctrine on us french and even 
soviet leaders and won no understanding for it 
unilateralism is not even comprehended by those who share our 
objectives in other countries he said 
they were totally uncomprehending that we should want to get 
rid of a nuclear system without getting elimination of nuclear 
weapons on other sides too without getting anything for it in 
return he said 
the 47yearold welshman once an ardent unilateralist 
reiterated a theme that has resonated throughout the twoday 
national executive meeting that only by breaking with the past 
can labor win power 
out of power we do not have the opportunities of unilateral 
or any other sort of disarmament he said we only have the 
chance to talk about it in power we can act and make dramatic 
progress 
unilateralism was adopted by labor in 1981 and has been cited as 
a key reason for labors two subsequent defeats by the 
conservatives under prime minister margaret thatcher who believes 
nuclear deterrence alone can keep the world at peace 
answering questions in parliament mrs thatcher said the new 
policy was unilateralism in a different wrapping 
her defense secretary george younger said to arm yourself 
with a deterrent which you then say you will not use would be 
about as effective as a feather duster 
labors foreign affairs chief gerald kaufman insisted the new 
policy was in line with most of britains nato partners 
on monday the national executive voted 234 to jettison 
commitments to renationalize all stateowned industries sold to 
private investors by the thatcher government 
on tuesday it dealt the hard left more defeats it threw out a 
proposal to abolish the unelected house of lords voting instead to 
establish an elected upper chamber calls to quit nato and the 
european economic community and withdraw british troops from 
northern ireland all were heavily defeated

states directly affected by the extensive soil 
and groundwater pollution at federal nuclear weapons factories 
should be given a bigger role in shaping a longterm cleanup plan 
state officials told congress on tuesday 
health and environmental regulators from idaho south carolina 
colorado and washington state said the energy department which 
owns 16 major nuclear arms facilities in 12 states must show a 
clearer commitment to working with the states 
we should have been involved six months ago in the energy 
departments cleanup planning for the savannah river nuclear 
weapons site in south carolina said lewis shaw of the south 
carolina department of health and environmental control 
shaw said it was very difficult for his state to judge 
whether the energy departments proposed spending for cleanup is 
adequate in part because no one yet knows the full extent of soil 
and groundwater contamination at savannah river the site contains 
three active nuclear reactors and several processing plants 
there are almost certainly problems as yet undiscovered 
shaw told a special panel of house members from states that host 
or are adjacent to the nuclear facilities all of this suggests 
that currently projected cleanup costs may be short of what will 
actually be needed to properly restore the site in timely manner 
the bush administration has proposed spending 400 million on 
cleanup in the coming budget year 
estimates of the cost of cleaning up the energy department 
facilities over the next three decades range from about 80 billion 
to about 150 billion although energy secretary james d watkins 
said last week the cost could be far less 
watkins top advisor on the nuclear cleanup problem leo duffy 
told the house panel watkins opposes a house bill that would create 
a special commission to assess cleanup priorities and recommend 
ways of carrying them out 
we believe enactment of legislation at this time would prove 
counterproductive and would complicate efforts now underway 
within doe to address environmental concerns duffy said 
the bill passed the house energy and commerce committee last 
month 
last week the governors of 10 states sent watkins a letter 
expressing concern frustration and anger at the contamination 
and years of environmental neglect at the nuclear facilities which 
have been operating since the early 1950s 
the governors called for increased federal spending and a 
clarification of the role of the states in ensuring environmental 
compliance and overseeing the cleanup 
the state officials testifying tuesday complained that while the 
energy department in recent years had begun paying closer attention 
to the waste problem it still was unclear whether the department 
was committed to a longterm cleanup 
we are in a period of uncertainty in colorado as to how doe 
intends to assure that its annual budget requests are consistent 
with the time frames for cleanup said tim holeman an advisor on 
environmental issues to colorado gov roy romer 
holeman said his state thinks more federal money should be made 
available in the next budget year to assess and begin correcting 
waste problems at the rocky flats nuclear facility near denver 
which processes plutonium and makes weapons components 
terry husseman assistant director for waste management in the 
washington state department of ecology told the panel his state 
was satisfied with the 80 million that the bush administration 
planned to spend in the coming budget year to restore the 
environment at the hanford reservation weapons plant near richland 
wash 
we are however very concerned over future funding 
prospects husseman said he said washington gov booth gardner 
favors creating a federal trust fund to ensure that enough money is 
available to finish the cleanup at hanford and elsewhere

the environmental protection agency ordered 
tighter safeguards tuesday to protect workers handling the 
pesticide bromoxynil saying that direct exposure could cause birth 
defects 
the epa said that there are only negligible health risks to 
consumers of food products on which the pesticide is used but that 
the risks are substantially greater to workers who come into direct 
contact with the chemical 
bromoxynil sold under the trade name buctril is used to 
control broadleaf weeds in the growing of field corn wheat 
onions garlic mint and flax 
under the epa directive mixers and other handlers of the 
chemical must wear protective clothing including 
chemicalresistant shoes or boots the manufacturer also must 
provide protective labels warning that exposure to a worker during 
pregnancy could cause birth defects 
epa believes that compliance with the new label directions and 
restrictions will provide adequate protection from the risk of

president bush will undergo a routine physical 
examination at nearby bethesda naval hospital on wednesday the 
white house announced tuesday 
the examination bushs first as president will include a chest 
xray hearing tests an eye examination an electrocardiagram 
allegery tests a urinalysis and a dermatology examination said a 
white house statement 
the statement by presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said that the examination would be under the direction of bushs 
personal physician dr burton lee 
lee will conduct a complete history and personal 
examination the statement said it said that lee had taken 
several blood samples earlier this week and that they will be 
analyzed as part of the examination 
bush 64 was expected to fly by helicopter from the white house 
to the hospital in bethesda md for the morning examination 
which is expected to take about four hours 
never felt better in my life bush said tuesday when asked 
about his health in an interview in the oval office with a group of 
reporters 
although he suffered from ulcers 20 years ago bush has said he 
is in excellent physical shape 
he suffers from several physical ailments however including a 
stronconductivity 
the study said efforts by other countries to create alliances of 
business government and academia have the potential to weaken 
the united states economically and militarily observers have 
suggested that the sematech model federally sponsored 
precompetitive industry cooperation may be one answer to this 
problem 
sematechs aim is to achieve global leadership in semiconductor 
manufacturing technology by 1993 
the consortium was created because of fears a decline in the 
us semiconductor industry may undermine the competitive and 
technological leadership of us computer and communications 
equipment makers also there is the immediate issue of a growing 
us dependence on foreign sources for stateoftheart weapons 
components the report said 
it cautioned however that even if sematech were a complete 
success in its own terms major issues now affecting the 
competitiveness of us chipmakers would remain limited marketing 
opportunities and a range of tax antitrust and trade policy 
issues 
the study also said the united states would still trail the 
japanese and europeans in developing technologies necessary for 
leadership in semiconductors in the late 1990s particularly in the 
area of xray lithography 
if the public investment in sematech is not followed by an 
increase in the competitive strength of us chipmakers and their 
suppliers sematech as a public policy will not have been 
successful the study said 
even as sematech was gaining momentum in 1988 us chipmakers 
continued to lose ground commercially us semiconductor 
manufacturers say their share of world market sales fall to 37 
percent 3 percentage points below 1987 levels the study said 
sen lloyd bentsen the chairman of the senate finance 
committee said tuesday he never doubted sematech would succeed 
but keeping up with the technology and successfully competing 
for worldwide chip sales are two different things said the texas 
democrat its not just the technology 
the studys author jeffrey l mayer deputy director of the 
office of economic policy at commerce said sematech now in its 
second year has done a very good job of getting to the starting 
line 
they are now in a position to begin achieving their explicit 
rampd objectives it remains to be seen how well they do that and 
no 2 what the longrange impact of that will be mayer said 
the study a report by the advisory council on federal 
participation in sematech recommends the pentagon spend 100 
million on sematech in fiscal 1990 which would be matched by the 
member corporations withdrawal of federal support now would 
seriously limit sematechs operations and prospects for success

a reformminded veteran chosen by the governing 
party to restore public trust after a major scandal says he will 
become prime minister only if all party officials linked to 
corruption resign sources said tuesday 
in the absence of other candidates with widespread support in 
the liberal democratic party persuading former foreign minister 
masayoshi ito appears to be the only solution for the time 
being party sources said on condition of anonymity 
he is among a few senior party officials not connected to the 
recruit scandal 
prime minister noboru takeshita and most other party leaders 
have been linked to the influencepeddling affair either through

studies of hearths and discarded seashells 
at old indian sites suggest huge earthquakes struck the northwest 
in the last 300 to 400 years far more recently than previously 
believed geologists said tuesday 
rick minor and wendy grant geologists working along the oregon 
coast presented papers to a geological society of america 
convention correlating sudden dramatic changes in land levels to 
disruptions in indian communities 
the evidence suggests the last major quake was 300 to 400 years 
ago said minor who is with a consulting company in eugene ore 
and grant a us geological survey scientist affiliated with the 
university of washington 
a lot of people think these happened very long ago said ms 
grant but people were living here and were affected by these 
erthquakes 
previous evidence suggested the last major quake was 3000 or 
more years ago the seismic events are believed to be caused by one 
of the earths plates diving under another at fault line beneath 
the pacific ocean 
chuck steele of the federal emergency management administration 
office in bothell said the discovery of a quake so recent could 
affect a geological survey study of the likelihood of an quake in 
the region and how to deal with it 
the sense of urgency is there he said 
the new information is significant because oregon has been 
regarded as one of the most seismically benign states in the 
country said brian atwater of the geological survey atwater 
studied land levels in washington and two years ago theorized that 
the last major quake was 3000 years ago 
grant said the research is the first to study the possible 
effects of severe land movement on human populations 
she said carbon dating of hearth sites and layers of shellfish 
eaten by people living near the ocean show periods where habitation 
abruptly ended 
these periods can be correlated to evidence of dramatic drops in 
land levels followed by a tsunami a giant wave associated with 
large earthquakes grant said 
scientists cautioned that carbon dating is imprecise and that 
the evidence while intriguing is circumstantial 
clearly much more work needs to be done on why people would 
be forced to move or change their subsistence patterns 
cautioned minor 
the only explanation is that it was a large earthquake said 
atwater but to really nail it down more research is needed 
he noted indian folklore contains no such reference to what 
would have been a significant event but minor speculated that 
diseases introduced by european and american settlers may have 
decimated the tribes wiping out ancient oral traditions by the 
time ethnographers began studying the tribes in the early 1900s 
as many as 2000 geologists from throughout the west are 
expected to attend the convention which runs through thursday

a hospitalized child is less likely to get 
depressed than his parents but their reactions can affect his 
level of distress says a study released tuesday 
researchers also were surprised to find children showed less 
distress if they had more exposure to sometimes discomforting 
medical procedures said p alex mabe of the medical college of 
georgia 
children may be able to become rapidly accustomed to such 
experiences mabe said at a news conference at the annual meeting 
of the american psychiatric association 
doctors have assumed for years that hospitalization caused 
depression in children but recent studies have questioned that 
mabe said 
his work done with colleagues at his school focused on 75 
children ages 6 to 15 who were admitted for treatment of a 
variety of disorders the children were assessed two to 10 days 
after admission 
researchers found that seven of the children reported symptoms 
that implied significant distress but the measurements suggested 
the hospitalized children experienced no greater distress than 
children in the general population 
in contrast 24 percent of the parents reported moderate to 
severe levels of depression 
the reason for the difference was not clear mabe said parents 
may be torn by competing responsibilities to the child and their 
family at home or parents may be interpreting their feelings as an 
emotional reaction while the child simply considers his reactions 
part of being physically sick he said 
children who had depressive symptoms were more likely to have 
mothers who were experiencing emotional distress mabe said 
perhaps the children use parents as an indicator to see how 
depressing they should consider the hospitalization he suggested 
alternatively a depressed parent may be less available to provide 
support 
in any case the apparent link means helping the parents out of 
depression may benefit both them and the child he said 
mabe cautioned that the study results may be affected by the 
fact that the work was done at a specialized hospital rather than a 
primarycare institution and that the children studied had 
generally been hospitalized several times 
asked how parents can minimize the trauma of hospitalization for 
a child mabe recommended taking an active role in the childs care 
in another presentation at the news conference elizabeth weller 
of ohio state university said many physicians do not know how to 
diagnose depression in children and are giving antidepressive 
drugs when they may not be needed 
a suspected case of child depression should be referred to an 
expert for diagnosis she said 
barbara geller of the university of south carolina said 
antidepressants have not yet been proven generally effective in 
children 
some depressed children will probably turn out to be helped by 
the drugs she said but at this point we cant select them out 
as well as we would like to 
but a child who has not responded to psychological treatment may 
still be a candidate for trying an antidepressant she said

a federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by 42 
congressmen and three states seeking to block the counting of 
illegal aliens in the 1990 census in part because they could not 
prove they will lose seats in congress by reapportionment 
the plaintiffs said they feared states with more illegal aliens 
would get a disproportionate number of house seats and electoral 
votes thus diminishing the political power of states with fewer 
illegal aliens 
the census bureau argued it is constitutionally obligated to 
count everyone including illegal aliens for congressional 
apportionment and has done so since the first census in 1790 house 
seats are redistributed every 10 years to reflect population 
changes 
us district judge william l standish said in a ruling filed 
late monday that the plaintiffs cannot show they would be hurt by 
the 1990 census because they are unable to establish how many 
illegal aliens will be present in which states these illegal 
aliens will reside or to what extent the illegal population will 
come forward to be counted 
the lawsuit was filed last year by the congressmen led by 
pennsylvania republican tom ridge and the states of pennsylvania 
kansas and alabama 
ridge said tuesday that standish dismissed the lawsuit on 
technical legal grounds and not on the merits of the census 
bureaus plans 
ridge recently named vice chairman of a house subcommittee that 
oversees the census bureau said he may appeal standishs decision 
and will introduce legislation in congress to change the method of 
the 1990 count 
standishs opinion noted that the congressmens demographer 
offered estimates that up to 56 million illegal aliens will be 
counted in 1990 the demographer predicted a gain of up to four 
congressional seats for california and one seat for texas and the 
possible loss of one seat each for georgia wisconsin north 
carolina minnesota and michigan 
the judge noted another congressional analyst had predicted 
gains for california texas new york illinois and florida at the 
expense of pennsylvania kansas west virginia and alabama 
but the judge said based on the evidence offered it is 
sheer speculation as to the identities of the states that will be 
affected by the inclusion of illegal aliens 
standish also said the state governments of pennsylvania kansas 
and alabama cannot show they would be damaged by reduced power or 
prestige with the loss of congressional representation he said 
only the residents of the states might suffer and they did not file 
the lawsuit 
standish noted that the nonprofit federation of american 
immigration reform a coplaintiff in the lawsuit filed a similar 
legal action in 1980 that was dismissed by a threejudge federal 
panel in the district of columbia 
ridge was joined by 19 colleagues from pennsylvania and others 
from kansas west virginia connecticut illinois indiana 
michigan missouri north carolina oregon virginia wisconsin 
alabama california and maryland

former postmaster general paul n carlin has 
charged in a civil suit that his successor albert v casey 
participated in a scheme to unseat him at the behest of a texas 
company seeking a 400 million contract 
carlins 5 million suit charges that casey who was postmaster 
general for seven months in 1986 lent his name and prestige to an 
effort by recognition equipment inc to obtain a solesource 
contract to produce electronic zip code scanning equipment 
the dallasbased company and two of its executives william g 
moore jr and robert w reedy are awaiting trial here on 
conspiracy charges stemming from an alleged scheme to influence the 
contract award in which 19000 was paid to postal service governor 
peter voss 
casey is not charged in the criminal case but the indictment 
maintains that the alleged contractrigging scheme included an 
effort to replace carlin with someone rei considered more 
sympathetic to its effort to sell the postal service 400 million 
worth of opticalscanning equipment 
caseys washington attorney hamilton p fox said tuesday that 
his client had no knowledge of reis interest in a contract before 
he became postmaster general 
the grand jury has investigated this thing there is just no 
evidence at all to support that allegation fox said 
there was no answer at caseys office in dallas 
carlins lawsuit filed monday in us district court here is 
the latest in a series of civil actions in the wake of the 
threeyear investigation that so far has yielded three convictions 
voss is among three people who have pleaded guilty in connection 
with the investigation and is cooperating with prosecutors 
carlin claims that casey is liable for civil damages under the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act but does not 
charge that he participated in the bribery scheme 
carlins suit recites bribery allegations contained in other 
criminal cases against rei moore reedy and others 
the suit charges that casey was aware of reis difficulties in 
obtaining a solesource postal service contract because of his 
friendship with robert crandall a former american airlines 
president who was a director of rei 
by taking the job casey was lending himself and his prestige 
to the conspiracy to obtain a contract for rei and thus to further 
the interests of the conspirators by doing their bidding after hjs 
appointment 
the suit also alleges that at vosss behest casey removed james 
v jellison as deputy postmaster general jellison was viewed by 
rei as another obstacle to the companys contract proposal 
jellison who retired rather than accept another job in the 
postal service has filed a separate lawsuit that among other 
things charges casey with infliction of emotional distress 
carlin claimed in the lawsuit that his abrupt replacement by 
casey damaged his reputation the stopgap nature of caseys 
tenure left the inference that he was taking the job because of 
some situation involving carlin personally when in fact there was 
no such situation or emergency 
last week the justice department filed a civil suit against 
rei claiming damages arising from the alleged contractrigging 
scheme the company has also been sued by several shareholders 
groups

officials said tuesday the government has asked 
washington to explain the loss of a nuclear bomb 200 miles from 
okinawa in 1965 which has inspired anger among okinawans and 
charges of a us coverup 
an a4 skyhawk jet carrying the bomb fell off the us aircraft 
carrier ticonderoga about 80 miles from a small island that is part 
of the okinawa prefecture an american military spokesman in japan 
said the ship was bound from vietnam to yokosuka japan 
newsweek magazine initially reported the story saying the bomb 
disappeared 70 miles from an inhabited japanese island on monday 
japan made an informal request for information from the united 
states 
the case added an irritant to us military relations with 
okinawa a japanese island where one of the bloodiest battles of 
world war ii was fought the continued presence of 35000 american 
soldiers on okinawa has led to tension and protests about such 
problems as accidents on target ranges 
asahi a national newspaper said in an editorial wednsday the 
incident is of such a nature that we simply cannot let it pass 
however long ago it occurred 
a foreign ministry spokesman said privately on tuesday this 
happened in international waters so we have no right to make a loud 
demand we are just asking the united states to give us an 
explanation we are interested and concerned about the details 
other officials said the government did not know the location or 
condition of the b43 bomb and there had been no discussions with 
the united states of what to do about it 
newsweek quoted nuclear expert william arkin of the institute 
for policy studies in washington as saying the us navy kept the 
incident secret until a 1981 pentagon report listed accidents 
involving nuclear weapons 
washington did not bring it to our attention at the time of 
the report the foreign office official said 
japan is the only country attacked with nuclear weapons and bans 
them from its territory the lost onemegaton bomb was about 70 
times as powerful as the one dropped on hiroshima in august 1945 
kyodo news service reported 
arkin was quoted as saying there was little danger of 
detonation but the 33 pounds of plutonium in the bomb could 
threaten the environment as it deteriorated 
the ticonderoga an attack carrier was on a mission that 
included readiness to launch a nuclear strike said a declassified 
us navy document released by arkin and the environmental group 
greenpeace 
that raised the possibility of the carrier entering yokosuka 
south of tokyo with nuclear arms despite the japanese ban 
in washingon on monday arkin said there is no doubt in my 
mind that us ships still transit japan with nuclear weapons 
aboard 
in washington pentagon spokesman dan howard denied any attempt 
to conceal what had happened 
it was way out to sea in international waters he said 
tuesday the weapon went down in 16000 feet of water there was 
no danger to anyone other than the unfortunate pilot of the 
aircraft in this incident there was not then and there is not 
now 
asked whether he would deny that navy ships entered japanese 
waters carrying nuclear weapons howard replied we are aware of 
the special sentiments of the japanese people with regard to 
nuclear weapons we have faithfully honored our obligations under 
the usjapanese treaty of mutual security and its related 
arrangements and well continue to do so 
he would not say whether the united states considered that a 
port call by a warship constituted introducing nuclear weapons to 
japan 
japanese opposition parties and citizens organizations have 
claimed us navy ships routinely visit japanese ports carrying 
nuclear weapons with the governments tacit agreement 
government officials said the united states is not allowed to 
bring in such weapons without prior consultation and there have 
been no such consultations 
the asahi editorial said if the aircraft carrier had docked 
at yokosuka without the accident having taken place the united 
states would have been censured as violating the usjapan 
security treaty requiring consultation 
besides it is hardly conceivable that the skyhawk in question 
was alone armed with a nuke the paper said which japanese 
port did the carrier eventually visit after the hydrogen bomb was 
lost 
asking what has become of the bomb the asahi editorial said 
wednesday has it not been crushed by the water pressure has 
radioactive material not leaked from it bit by bit

instead of being a boon to us employment 
the surge of foreign investment in the united states during the 
mid1980s cost america more jobs than it created two researchers 
said tuesday 
the tripling of foreign investment during the 1980s came largely 
from takeovers of existing companies rather than construction of 
new plants and offices said norman glickman director of the 
center for urban policy research and state of new jersey professor 
of planning at rutgers university 
its primarily a shift in ownership from an american owner to 
a foreign owner glickman said this does not necessarily 
create jobs and often it can in fact destroy jobs 
in a new book the new competitors glickman and douglas 
woodward assistant professor of economics at the university of 
south carolina said they found that foreign investment rose to 
262 billion in 1987 triple the amount of direct investment at the 
start of the decade 
they discussed their findings at a news conference sponsored by 
the economic policy institute a laborbacked think tank based in 
washington 
the authors found that while foreign firms or their affiliates 
employ about 3 million workers most of those employees represent 
the transfer of old jobs from an american to a foreign boss 
from 1982 to 1986 foreign investors cut 56000 more jobs 
through layoffs than they created through new plants and expansion 
the researchers said 
even excluding the 198283 recession years only about 15000 to 
20000 jobs a year were created by foreign investment a very 
small number in a 100 millionjob economy glickman said 
glickman said the japanese have been the most likely to invest 
in new plants and create jobs in the united states but have been 
the greatest recipients of xenophobia in this country 
he said that even as foreign companies have created few new 
jobs they exert little control over the us economy while 
foreign companies employ 3 percent of american workers and own 8 
percent of the nations assets those are still relatively small 
numbers he said 
they are growing fast and they are of considerable concern 
glickman said but at present thats an issue which we need to 
watch but not be as fearful of 
glickman said foreign investment in the united states has 
worsened the nations trade deficit because the companies exports 
are overshadowed by imports of intermediate goods used in 
production 
foreign investors had a net trade deficit of about 8 billion in 
1986 and the rate has increased since then glickman said 
the authors called for the creation of a government agency to 
analyze the economic impact of major foreign investments 
woodward said that because the addition of a new foreignowned 
plant can be a big boon to a particular region local officials 
have engaged in counterproductive global smokestack chasing 
offering huge incentives to lure plants their way 
our mayors and governors are falling all over themselves 
woodward said theyre frequent fliers at the governments 
expense as if theyve discovered this holy grail for economic 
development 
woodward said the incentives being offered in some cases cost 
tens of thousands of dollars for each job created without holding 
companies accountable for a specific contribution to the local 
economy

delegates to the world health organizations 
annual assembly worked nervously tuesday to head off a showdown 
with the united states over a plo request for full membership in 
the un body 
diplomatic sources said a proposal to put off the decision in 
exchange for greater medical aid to palestinians was gaining 
support 
in a move aggravating tensions the palestine liberation 
organization submitted a separate request tuesday to be recognized 
as a full member by another un agency parisbased unesco 
since the palestine national council which acts as a 
parliamentinexile proclaimed the state of palestine last 
november the plo has been seeking full membership as a state in 
all un agencies it now holds nonvoting observer status 
the united states and its western allies have not recognized the 
new state which controls no territory washington which pays 25 
percent of whos regular budget of 625 million for 198889 has 
threatened to withdraw its money if palestine is recognized as the 
167th member of who 
diplomats at the who assembly which began monday worked 
tensely tuesday in search of a compromise a senior west european 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was a 
general desire to reach a compromise but it is like walking on 
eggs 
another source who also spoke on condition of anonymity said 
there was growing support for a proposal to combine a postponement 
of a decision on plo membership with increased medical assistance 
to palestinian residents of the israelioccupied territories 
a report by a who committee published tuesday said health 
services there have remained the same or even deteriorated over the 
past four years 
the authors of the compromise proposal in a bid to gain plo 
support suggested that it also express the hope that the 
people of palestine would be fully represented in who at some 
later time the source said 
he said most western countries the soviet bloc and some third 
world countries have indicated support for such language 
however sources at the assembly said the united states has 
opposed that wording arguing it implies recognition of palestinian 
statehood 
addressing the who session dr louis w sullivan us 
secretary of health and human services made no reference to 
washingtons threat to withdraw funding but he called on the more 
than 1000 delegates not to let themselves be diverted by 
political issues 
who directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima in a reference to the 
us warning urged the meeting earlier to come to a decision 
that will not jeopardize the survival of our organization 
in paris the plo presented a letter to federico mayor director 
general of the un educational scientific and cultural 
organization to ask for recognition as a member state 
the plos unesco representative omar massalha said the request 
would be put on the agenda of unescos executive board the body 
begins a fiveweek meeting may 17 
final approval however must be given by a twothirds majority 
of the 158nation unesco general conference which meets in 
november 
massalha said a nations vote in favor of the plo request would 
not amount to diplomatic recognization by that country 
the united states withdrew from unesco in 1984 charging it was 
too political and mismanaged

president bush will soon propoose legislation 
to transfer federal family planning programs which generate 
continual controversy over abortion to state control the 
administrations top family planning official told a senate panel 
tuesday 
making the states the sole family planning grantees will 
enable them to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring services 
to best meet their citizens needs said nabers chambers deputy 
assistant secretary for population affairs at the department of 
health and human services 
in advocating the transfer she did not specifically mention 
differences over how far federally funded family planning clinics 
can go in telling pregnant women about the availablity of abortion 
a matter now being fought over in three separate federal court 
suits 
but ms chambers said giving states authority over how to parcel 
out the federal money allocated to them for family planning would 
allow them flexibility to operate clinics through county 
agencies private agencies or hospitals as is most appropriate for 
each particular state 
congress consistently rejected similar efforts by president 
reagan to transfer the program to state control 
ms chambers a holdover from the reagan administration headed 
the departments office of population affairs last year when 
regulations were put in place designed to bar counselors in 
federally funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion 
with their clients 
two of three federal district judges who considered the case 
quickly found the regulations in violation of the public health 
service act and an appeals court in boston recently upheld one of 
those two rulings 
prior to the appeals court decision the administration sought 
to apply the regulations in parts of the nation not covered by a 
court order against them ms chambers told the senate committee it 
is too soon to say if the administration will pursue that policy in 
light of the appeals court decision 
faye wattleton president of planned parenthood federation of 
america complained the program has been subjected to both 
political harassment and administration confusion since 1981 
when reagan took office 
thanks to the efforts of the programs congressional 
supporters and to the basic strength of the program itself title 
x has largely withstood this array of assaults she said but 
they have taken their toll and the open attacks on title x that 
have been ongoing since 1981 must end 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the committee chairman opened 
the hearing by stating his intention to have the panel approve a 
threeyear reauthorization of the family planning legislation on 
friday observing that the issues are already well known to 
committee members 
although the program has not been formally reauthorized since 
1981 it has continued to operate with annual appropriations based 
on the underlying 1981 law 
ms chambers said 1383 million is being spent in federal money 
this year to provide family planning services through 88 grant 
receipients at 4000 clinics to an estimated 43 million women 
about a third of them adolescents

government troops have launched a 
major offensive against anticommunist rebels besieging the eastern 
city of jalalabad a foreign ministry spokesman said tuesday 
we are now in the offensive position said mohammad nabi 
amani in the last three days we have started concentrating on 
the enemy positions we would like to vanish the enemy from the 
city and then start moving out 
the report could not be confirmed independently 
amani gave few details but said there was fighting north and 
east of the city and 37 guerrillas have been killed and 27 wounded 
since monday night 
despite the counterattacks the usbacked moslem rebels fired 
rockets into jalalabad late monday and tuesday that killed four 
civilians and a government soldier and destroyed 11 houses and a 
mosque according to amani he did not mention other casualties 
among the government forces at jalalabad 75 miles east of the 
capital of kabul 
amani also reported a battle at sarobin about half way between 
jalalabad and kabul and 15 rebels trying to block the main supply 
highway were slain 
he said three rockets struck kabul early tuesday but reported no 
casualties 
amanis report indicated the marxist government of president 
najib was making a major effort to lift the siege of jalalabad that 
began march 6 when guerrillas captured the nearby garrison town of 
samarkel 
amani said samarkel was retaken by government forces but he had 
no reports about the surrounding districts 
the rebels siege of jalalabad has been their most concentrated 
and sustained effort since the soviet union withdrew its remaining 
troops from afghanistan in midfebruary the soviets sent troops 
into afghanistan in december 1979 and for years had more than 
100000 military personnel in the country in an unsuccessful effort 
to crush the revolt 
government sources said tuesday that troops were preparing for a 
rebel assault on the southern city of kandahar and repeated the 
claim that pakistan would provide support for the guerrillas 
kandahar about 300 miles southwest of kabul is considered more 
vulnerable than jalalabad 
najib has claimed pakistan is deploying about 15000 soldiers 
across the border near quetta to help in an attack on kandahar 60 
miles west of the frontier quetta is 50 miles east of the border 
the sources speaking on the condition they not be identified 
said the rebels were expected to launch the attack this week to 
mark the end of a threeday feast following the islamic holy month 
of ramadan 
the rebels have been trying to capture an afghan city for a base 
for their governmentinexile they established in february in 
pakistan 
pakistan and the united states have provided supplies to the 
rebels but pakistan has denied repeated claims by the afghan 
government that it is sending troops into afghanistan to suport the 
rebels 
the soviet union continues to supply weapons and ammunition to 
najibs troops 
before the civil war began more than 10 years ago kandahar was 
afghanistans secondlargest city after kabul but tens of 
thousands of people fled the city because of the fighting and 
government officials say they dont know how many remain

failures by the iowa interstate railroad and 
the federal railroad administration to enforce train operating 
rules and a tired train crews error caused the fiery collision of 
two freight trains in altoona iowa last summer federal safety 
officials concluded tuesday 
the july 30 headon crash killed two crewmen on a westbound 
train en route from newton iowa to des moines when it collided 
with a train bound from council bluffs iowa to chicago the two 
employees on the eastbound train jumped to safety 
more than 2000 people were evacuated from their homes in and 
around altoona as two tank cars containing 20000 gallons of 
denatured alcohol burned for more than two days 
the national transportation safety board said the eastbound 
train with 78 cars departed altoona before its permitted time 
its crew had been on duty for nearly 10 hours after having only 
four or five hours of sleep the night before the board said 
contributing to the train crews failure to comply with the 
wait provisions was a combination of fatigue induced by irregular 
workrest schedules preoccupation with completing their asisgnment 
prior to exceeding duty time limits inexperience mental set or 
expectations based on previously issued train orders the work 
activities which intervened since they recieved the train order 
and the failure of the railroad to properly train its crews 
the board said in its finding of a probable cause 
the board said iowa interstate which operated both trains had 
no way of knowing that the westbound train had departed its initial 
terminal because it did not maintain a record of train movements as 
required by federal regulations 
it said however the westbound train was being operated 
properly and would have had time to clear the area if the eastbound 
train had not pulled onto the track early 
the board cited several deficiencies in the railroads training 
programs and proficiency testing of its employees 
the federal railroad administration the board said failed to 
take action against the railroad for not complying with federal 
rules it recommended that the agency conduct a safety audit of 
iowa interstate 
the board also recommended that several steps be taken to 
decrease the likelihood of tanker cars catching fire including 
improved design to ensure that closure fittings stay closed in 
accidents that do not rupture the tank itself the report said that 
release of the alcohol from pressure release valves contributed to 
the length of the emergency 
the board said there was no evidence that any mechanical problem 
with either train or track conditions contributed to the crash or 
that alcohol or drug use was a factor

customs authorities on tuesday challenged a court 
ruling preventing them from handing over to us drug enforcement 
agencies documents belonging to panamas de facto ruler gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
customs agents seeking evidence in a drugsrelated 
moneylaundering case said they found noriega family accounts by 
chance after raiding a bank in london last october 
customs lawyer andrew collins said the investigation was not 
aimed at noriega who was indicted in florida last year on us 
drug trafficking charges noriega denied the charges 
commissioners of the customs and excise department argued that a 
judges ban on us authorities seeing details of the noriega 
family accounts was unreasonable and interfered with the battle 
against global drug dealing 
collins told the court of appeal the earlymorning bank raid 
coincided with swoops by drug trade investigators in the united 
states 
individuals in 10 us cities and paris and london were accused 
of taking part in a ring that laundered profits from the colombian 
cocaine trade through the luxembourgbased bank of credit and 
commerce international or bcci holdings 
bcci two subsidiaries and nine bank officials were charged with 
laundering 14 million in drug profits collected from seven us 
cities 
collins said agents obtained a warrant to enter the banks 
london office and then discovered the office of one suspect was in 
an adjoining building 
he said agents quickly obtained an additional warrant to enter 
that building and found a locked cabinet containing files and 
accounts belonging to noriega his wife felicidad daughters lorena 
and sandra and soninlaw jean rene de beauchamp 
collins said the customs officer believed the files would be 
important in investigating noriegas alleged involvement in drug 
trafficking and possibly would help in the bcci investigation 
the officer could not remove the documents under the warrant so 
he applied to southwark crown court judge valerie pearlman for an 
order requiring the bank to produce the documents for inspection 
and the judge so ordered collins said 
the bank challenged the order the judge upheld the order but 
only on condition that us drug enforcement agencies were not 
given the documents 
collins said the judge was concerned about an alleged risk to 
the bank and its employees in panama if material was passed on to 
the us 
he asked the court of appeal to quash the ruling saying the law 
makes it perfectly clear that what should concern the court 
is not only drug trafficking in this country but drug trafficking 
in any other country in the world 
the hearing is expected to take at least two days

the united states could lose nuclear power as 
an energy source unless public confidence in its safety is 
restored a senior energy department official said tuesday 
without restoration of public understanding of the efficacy 
and safety of nuclear power there may never well be another 
nuclear power plant ordered in the united states john c tuck 
the undersecretary of energy told a nuclear industry group 
tuck in his first major public address since being confirmed 
last month as the no 3 official in the energy department said the 
department strongly supported nuclear power and would do everything 
possible to help the industry expand 
rest assured that the department of energy will at every 
opportunity advocate vigorously on behalf of nuclear energy tuck 
told the nuclear power assembly the industrys annual meeting 
we will make the case for nuclear power before the american 
people and we will be forceful advocates tuck said he 
reiterated the departments recent vow to try to prevent new york 
gov mario cuomo from tearing down the shoreham nuclear plant on 
long island 
shoreham got its operating license from the nuclear regulatory 
commission last month but cuomo and the plants owner have agreed 
to dismantle it state and local officials say long island could 
not be evacuated in the event of a severe accident 
lando w zech jr chairman of the nuclear regulatory 
commission told the nuclear assembly he was concerned by the fact 
that no nuclear plant had been ordered since 1978 and that none 
currently was planned he said the commissions recent decision to 
streamline the licensing process could help the industry rebound 
zech called the licensing decision perhaps the most important 
change ever made to the nrcs power reactor licensing process 
and said it would lead to safer reactor designs 
in another development sen john breaux dla introduced a 
bill tuesday to abolish the nrc and replace it with a nuclear 
safety agency headed by a single administrator he said the 
fivemember commission and its staff had undermined public 
confidence in nuclear power by becoming too cozy with the industry 
a similar bill passed the senate last year but died in the house

rudolph w giuliani prepared tuesday to dive 
into the race for mayor counting on his appeal as a crimefighting 
prosecutor to overcome his republican affiliation in this 
overwhelmingly democratic city 
giuliani who gained fame with a string of highprofile 
prosecutions as us attorney in manhattan hopes to fashion a 
fusion candidacy in the mold of john v lindsay in 1965 the last 
republican to win city hall 
giulianis formal announcement was scheduled wednesday ending a 
year and a half of speculation about his political future that 
continued even as he was putting mobsters wall street cheats and 
corrupt politicians in jail 
the city is in very very bad shape and the mayor is 
responsible for it giuliani 44 said in february while still 
considering his prospects the city is in a grave crisis and i 
think its time for new leadership 
his decision to offer himself for mayor was bolstered by polls 
that have consistently shown him defeating incumbent mayor edward 
i koch or any other likely democratic nominee in a hypothetical 
matchup 
giuliani has said for months that he would run only if he 
appeared to have enough support to win but in a city where 
democrats outnumber republicans 51 his victory is by no means 
assured 
he started with a bold potentially risky stroke last month 
winning the endorsement of the citys tiny liberal party and 
assuring himself a place on the november ballot lindsay did the 
same thing 
giulianis next must tackle the republican primary he faces a 
wellfinanced challenge from cosmetics heir ronald lauder whos 
running as a conservative more in tune with new yorks gop 
stalwarts 
the republican party has an obligation to choose a candidate 
that represents its principles said nelson warfield lauders 
spokesman we think that ronald lauder is that candidate rudy 
giuliani with the liberal party endorsement cant ride two horses 
at one time 
giuliani has not ruled out tax increases warfield said lauder 
has 
next on the giulianibashing line was koch who has been 
charging recently that giuliani cant be counted on to continue 
city support of abortions for poor women because giuliani 
personally opposes abortion 
giuliani campaign spokesman charles perkins said tuesday that as 
mayor giuliani would continue to fund abortions at current levels 
perkins added that giuliani preferred to focus on the issues 
the mayor has some ability to confront and resolve like crime and 
drugs and the health care system and the infrastructure 
giuliani also promised to make an issue of integrity corruption 
scandals have rocked city government but not touched koch since 
1986 giuliani prosecuted the most prominent of those cases 
winning a racketeering conviction of bronx democratic boss stanley 
friedman 
following that case giuliani was mentioned last year as a 
challenger to democratic us sen daniel patrick moynihan 
giuliani flirted with the notion dropped it then left the 
prosecutors office in january after 5 years to explore the 
mayoral race 
koch his popularity lagging could lose the democratic 
nomination challenger david dinkins the manhattan borough 
president leads in polls and giuliani leads in polls pitting him 
against dinkins 
but it is four months before the primaries six months before 
the general election and giuliani who never has held elective 
office is untried as a campaigner in new yorks barefisted 
political ring 
asked for comment about giulianis candidacy koch spokesman lee 
jones said we just think in november hell regret it

sen connie mack rfla introduced 
legislation tuesday calling on the bush administration to nullify 
the panama canal treaties in light of reports of election fraud in 
panamas presidential elections 
mack said the move is justified because it is clear the 
countrys military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega is 
stealing the presidential election from the panamanian people 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the 
president has no plan to abrogate the canal treaties 
mack acted after examining the conduct of sundays election in 
panama as a member of a white house observer team 
the panama canal treaties ratified in 1977 provide for panama 
to take control of the canal at the end of 1999 
if we were facing this same situation in 1999 rather than 
1989 congress would be falling all over itself looking for a way 
to keep control of the canal mack said lets work now to 
address our concerns with the canal so were not forced to confront 
the issue later mack said 
it was not clear whether mack would be able to muster majority 
support for his legislation 
but apparent fraud in the elections in panama stirred widespread 
condemnation on capitol hill 
rep john murtha dpa said members of the observer delegation 
had told the president that we saw such widespread irregularities 
and actual fraud that we didnt see any way that it could be a free 
and fair election 
friends of freedom everywhere share a growing sense of outrage 
over the flagrant fraud being committed by gen noriega in his 
desperate effort to steal the election and stay in power said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass 
gen noriega is a disgrace to democracy kennedy said no 
amount of fraud can conceal his overwhelming repudiation by the 
citizens of his country 
sen bob graham dfla another member of the observer team 
urged bush to withdraw us military dependents and us civilians 
from panama while increasing the number of combatants among the 
10000 us troops stationed there to protect the canal 
but rep larry smith dfla said the actual use of military 
force was the last option you would consider 
i dont believe the first thing we are going to see is some 
sort of warroom exercise of people deciding when they are going to 
the mat with noriega militarily smith said its just not 
happening

president bush in his first public comment on 
the oliver north verdict said tuesday he had wanted all along to 
see him exonerated 
asked if he thought north who was found guilty last thursday on 
three of 12 felony counts was innocent the president said im 
not going to argue with the courts the process is being appealed 
hes entitled to the right of appeal without a lot of editorial 
comment from me although ive already given you some 
bush was asked about north at the end of an interview with a 
group of reporters in the oval office 
on another subject bush brushed aside a dispute with west 
germany over shortrange nuclear missiles an issue which threatens 
the harmony of a nato summit may 2930 
i have a good feeling that theres been a lot of smoke out 
there and well have a smooth summit bush said asked if that 
meant he was willing to compromise bush replied it might mean 
people are willing to do it our way with the united states 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has called for eastwest 
negotiations soon to reduce shortrange weapons in europe but the 
bush administration has argued that they are needed to compensate 
for an overwhelming superiority in conventional forces by the 
sovietled warsaw pact 
bush also discussed the issue in private with a dutch delegation 
led by prime minister ruud lubbers 
the president summoned reporters to his office to declare that 
panamas presidential election on sunday was marred by fraud and to 
call on manuel antonio noriega to heed the call of the people 
and relinquish power 
and i call on all foreign leaders to urge general noriega to 
honor the clear results of the election bush said 
on a personal matter bush will undergo a routine physical 
examination his first as president at bethesda naval hospital on 
wednesday 
bush 64 told reporters never felt better in my life 
as for north the former white house aide is awaiting sentencing 
on his convictions of illegally destroying and altering government 
documents accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting in 
obstruction of congress investigation of the irancontra affair 
white house officials have said bush has not discussed the 
possibility of a pardon for north 
bush when asked his reaction to the verdict said as you 
know i wanted all along to see him exonerated the matter is now 
under appeal and thus ill have nothing more to say about it while 
it is 
as the interview broke up he was asked you dont believe in 
shredding documents do you 
i believe in taking them with me he joked 
bush said several times during the 1988 presidential campaign 
that he believed north would be aquitted of charges stemming from 
his role in the reagan administrations efforts to help the 
nicaraguan rebels 
he has also called north a hero saying he was referring to the 
retired marine lieutenant colonels record in vietnam 
a governmentapproved document introduced during norths trial 
said bush met early in 1985 in honduras with thenpresident roberto 
suazo it said bush informed suazo of thenpresident reagans 
decision to speed us military and economic aid to the country 
expedited aid that the document said had been approved as part of a 
deal to gain honduran support for the contras 
the document did not say bush was part of any such deal and he 
said emphatically last week that despite what the document said 
there was no deal no quid pro quo

the nations big three automakers said tuesday 
theyre working as fast as they can to eliminate from car air 
conditioners a chemical that attacks the earths ozone layer but 
it may not be fast enough 
the vermont legislature has passed and the governor is expected 
to sign a bill that after 1993 would outlaw the registration of 
vehicles whose air conditioners contain cfc12 
cfc12 is a type of chlorofluorocarbon or cfc a class of 
chemicals best known under the trade name freon most other cfc 
applications such as refrigerators use different types of cfc 
chlorofluorocarbons that rise into the upper atmosphere attack 
the protective ozone layer scientists say that lets in extra 
ultraviolet radiation that increases the number of cases of skin 
cancer and eye disease and that damages plants and animals crucial 
to the food chain 
researchers at general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp and their suppliers have been looking for ways to eliminate 
cfc12 from their cars air conditioning systems 
most of the research is going into a substance called 134a 
which contains no chlorofluorocarbons 
work is continuing as if it is the substance of choice said 
douglas mark an emission engineer for gm 
but there are problems 
there is no compatible lubricant and the toxicological 
testing is not finished said norm nielsen supervisor of 
government regulatory programs at chrysler officially it will 
take three or four years to finish 
mark noted that longterm health tests of 134a are expected to 
go through 1992 when the 1993 modelyear vehicles mentioned in the 
vermont law will be in production 
the automobile industry has learned to live with california 
regulations governing exhaust emissions that are stiffer than other 
states cars made for sale in california have different exhaust 
emission control systems than for general sale 
but officials of the big three automakers say there are more 
problems switching from cfc12 to something else than in switching 
equipment to meet california air quality standards 
the whole system has to be changed mark said theres got 
to be compressor and evaporator changes materials have to be 
reevaluated for seals and hoses

into panamas vote tabulation center with an open mind but stormed

believed that duque his handpicked candidate would win in a fair 
election

dutch leaders met twice with president bush on 
tuesday in an effort to find a solution to nato differences over 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
bush told reporters he set aside an additional hour to discuss 
the issue with the delegation led by prime minister ruud lubbers 
and that he expected the differences with the west german 
government to be cleared up by the time of the nato summit in three 
weeks 
i have a good feeling that theres been a lot of smoke out 
there and that well have a smooth summit bush said 
but he added i dont believe in deadlines 
bush was asked whether he had had any more telephone 
conversations with west german chancellor helmut kohl on the 
problem kohl opposes modernizing us shortrange missiles 
stationed in europe and wants to negotiate with the soviet union 
for elimination of the weapons 
oh i never discuss these all these talks ive had bush 
said 
kohl was reported to have been irritated that the white house 
disclosed that he and bush discussed their differences in a phone 
call on friday 
the bush administration has argued that shortrange missiles are 
needed in europe to compensate for an overwhelming superiority in 
conventional forces by the sovietled warsaw pact 
bush said lubbers was a friend of long standing and that 
they would be able to discuss the issue very very frankly 
but this alliance is not going to fall apart said bush 
it is going to stay together and be strong and well work it 
out 
asked whether the united states was willing to compromise bush 
said it might mean people are willing to do it our way were 
the united states 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said his country had 
presented a compromise solution at meetings going on in brussels at 
the headquarters of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization but he declined to say what the dutch text contained 
van den broek said a possible solution to the rift which 
threatens to disrupt a nato summit scheduled for may 29 would be 
for the allies to ask for unilateral cuts in the soviet shortrange 
missile arsenal 
a west german official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said however that bonn has grave reservations about unilateral 
cutbacks because they might not be verifiable and that an agreement 
including verification procedures would be preferable

a charge of armed robbery against 
diffrent strokes star todd bridges was dropped tuesday after 
prosecutors said they had new information on the case which they 
declined to describe 
bridges 23 still faces attempted murder charges for a feb 2 
shooting at a reputed drug den in southcentral los angeles in 
which the victim survived and later identified his attackers 
another man also is charged in that case 
bridges for eight years played the character willis jackson on 
diffrent strokes opposite costars gary coleman and conrad bain 
in the armed robbery charge investigators said bridges took his 
bmw from a repair shop at gunpoint jan 23 instead of paying a 500 
repair bill the shooting also stemmed from a dispute over the same 
car investigators have said 
but when bridges preliminary hearing was about to begin 
tuesday deputy district attorney robert gosney moved to dismiss 
the charges 
some new information came in that cast a serious doubt on 
whether we had the right man gosney said 
he declined to describe the information and said the robbery 
charge may be refiled against bridges if the new evidence fails to 
stand 
authorities have said bridges was one of two men who had taken 
the car in for repairs

president bush said tuesday that panamas 
presidential election was marred by fraud and irregularities and 
called on military ruler manuel antonio noriega to heed the call 
of the people and relinquish power 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush was 
considering options ranging from military force to economic 
sanctions against panama 
but the president said he would not talk about us alternatives 
until panama announces the official results of sundays election 
us officials privately said that an armed invasion was highly 
unlikely and that the more probable options would be to strengthen 
military forces impose tougher sanctions or withdraw military 
dependents and civilians 
i call on all foreign leaders to urge gen noriega to honor 
the clear results of the election bush said in a hurriedly 
called questionandanswer session with reporters in the oval 
office 
i would like to think that he noriega will heed the call of 
the people and that he would listen to the international outcry 
that is building and that he would step down from office in which 
case the relations with the united states would improve 
dramatically and instantly bush said 
bush hopes that pressure from other central american nations and 
the apparent success of noriegas opposition will persuade him to 
abandon power said an administration official speaking on 
condition of anonymity were going to proceed slowly were 
going to take our time the official said 
the president commented after meeting with a delegation of 
official us observers in late afternoon bush met in the oval 
office with former president carter who led another observer 
delegation 
afterward carter accused noriega of thievery and said 
election tabulations he examined were patently counterfeit he 
called noriega amoral 
standing in a light rain in the white house driveway carter 
cautioned against the use of us military force and said the 
united states should not abrogate the panama canal treaties which 
were negotiated and signed during his administration 
any sort of military involvement down there would immediately 
alienate the panamanian people who respect their nations 
sovereignty as do we carter said and obviously unilateral 
action is much weaker than action in concert with other democratic 
countries i think these are more fruitful 
as for abrogating the treaties carter said that would play 
right into the hands of noriega its the kind of thing he would 
like to see it would alienate every other nation in this 
hemisphere 
carter who was accompanied by other members of his team told 
bush that a scientific poll conducted by the roman catholic church 
with a maximum margin of error of eight or nine percent said 
noriega had won in only two polling places 
bush said the observers reports demonstrate clearly that 
despite massive irregularities at the polls the opposition has won 
a clearcut overwhelming victory 
the panamanian people have spoken and i call on gen noriega 
to respect the voice of the people and i call on all foreign 
leaders to urge gen noriega to honor the clear results of the 
election bush said 
asked why noriega might leave power now after ignoring us 
demands for a year bush said because there has been a massive 
voice of the people heard 
there has been a statement for democracy so loud and so clear 
that perhaps even gen noriega will listen to it 
bush praised president alan garcia of peru who has spoken out 
against the fraud and said that venezuelan president carlos 
andres perez was encouraging neighboring countries to issue a joint 
statement against the fraud that is taking place and calling on 
noriega to honor the results of this election 
hinting at recent us contacts with noriega bush said the 
panamanian leader knows my position he knows about it 
through recent contacts 
fitzwater told reporters earlier in the day 
our policy remains that noriega must go 
fitzwater said that bush and his national security advisers 
have been considering options that range from the use of military 
force to various economic and commercial moves related to a us 
presence in that country 
the united states has waged a yearlong campaign of economic and 
diplomatic sanctions to dislodge noriega but has not been 
successful 
there were these other developments 
the official us delegation reported to bush that in the 
words of its chairman we didnt see any way that it could be a 
free and fair election 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said the defense department had 
alerted american servicemen stationed in panama and their 
dependents to avoid travel around the country 
we have a very uneasy situation in panama howard said 
fitzwater told reporters that us military personnel in panama had 
been harassed and were on a very high state of alert 
the state department contradicted a panamanian government 
assessment that based on returns from four of 40 election 
districts noriegas handpicked presidential candidate carlos 
duque was leading opposition candidate guillermo endara by 80646 
votes to 54437 
rather said state department spokesman richard boucher the 
administration believes panamanians voted by margins of two or 
three to one to replace noriegas regime 
fitzwater said american officials were convinced that the 
opposition candidate had the support and the votes to fairly win 
this election and we are just as convinced that the noriega regime 
made every effort took every opportunity had every intention of 
stealing this election regardless of the actual vote 
members of the official delegation sent by bush met with him at 
the white house and later called the voting a sham 
we told the president that we saw such widespread 
irregularities and actual fraud that we didnt see any way that it 
could be a free and fair election said rep john murtha dpa 
the delegations head 
he said there was a sense of urgency about the need for 
action 
another member of the delegation sen bob graham dfla 
urged bush to withdraw us military dependents and citizens from 
panama while beefing up the number of combatants among the 10000 
us troops there 
one of the worst things we could do would be to give the 
appearance of a forceful action and then collapse when the pressure 
got too great graham said 
fitzwater said he did not think an evacuation of dependents was 
under way but added thats not to say there isnt planning 
underway that would accommodate a number of movements of one kind 
or another 
rep larry smith dfla who was also in the official us 
delegation said military force was the last option youd 
consider 
i dont believe that the first thing were going to see is 
some kind of warroom exercise of people deciding when theyre 
going to go to the mat with noriega militarily smith said 
its just not happening 
fitzwater hinted that provisions of the 1977 panama canal 
treaties might be used to intensify pressures against noriega 
there is no plan to abrogate the canal treaties under which 
the united states has agreed to turn the americanbuilt canal over 
to panamanian control on the last day of this century fitzwater 
said however we do have concerns about how they are carried 
out 
after noriega engineered the ouster of president eric arturo 
delvalle in february 1988 thenpresident reagan froze about 50 
million in panamanian assets in us banks

reformer stipe suvar will step aside 
as communist party chief next week but he will join the 
governments influential ninemember presidency news reports said 
tuesday 
he would have been forced to give up his party post next month 
anyway because the party leadership rotates annually beginning in 
june the leadership transfers to a party official from the 
republic of macedonia 
suvar recently was elected to represent the republic of croatia 
in the nineman state presidency news reports said he will be 
inaugurated as a member of the presidency on may 15 and resign as 
party chief on may 17 
the seat on the presidency assures suvar a continued role on the 
national political stage where he is battling his serbian 
political rival slobodan milosevic 
he is a more authoritarian orthodox communist than suvar 
although both men have backed marketoriented reforms 
milosevic was proclaimed monday as president of the republic of 
serbia which gives him largely a figurehead role in the largest of 
yugoslavias six republics in addition milosevic will have to 
give up his seat on the national partys ruling politburo 
the dispute between suvar and milosevic reflects ethnic divides 
between the serbs the dominant ethnic group in yugoslavias 
patchwork of nationalities and the rival croats and other northern 
people 
milosevic has bolstered serbian authority in the province of 
kosovo where the ethnic albanian majority rioted over his policies 
in march the clashes in the province on the albanian border left 
at least 24 dead 
media reports on tuesday quoted suvar as saying that because 
of the political quarrels within the party tomorrow we could have 
brutal clashes because of mounting economic and political strife 
yugoslavia suffers an annual inflation rate of about 500 
percent which has helped fuel ethnic tensions 
serbias security chief dragutin mitrovic told yugoslav 
journalists tuesday that police have stepped up security in kosovo 
after intercepting reports that ethnic albanians plan sabotage and 
assassination attempts on senior communist officials there and in 
neighboring serbia 
mitrovic said there exists a latent danger of further unrest 
by ethnic albanians in kosovo primarily in the form of acts of 
sabotage and assassinations 
he said targets of hostile albanian emigres include 
leading personalities in serbia and kosovo but gave no details 
he also did not elaborate on the new security measures 
many security forces have already been deployed in kosovo and a 
state of emergency imposed during the unrest remains in place 
in a related development the state tanjug news agency said 12 
people including eight policeman were arrested in the republic of 
montenegro and accused of selling stolen firearms to albanians in 
kosovo 
the eight policeman reportedly had served in kosovo 
the weapons included pistols semiautomatic rifles and a 
machine gun tanjug said

capital citiesabc and wjlatv the networks 
local station aired unfair portrayals of blacks while reporting on 
washingtons drug problem nadine winter a member of the city 
council said tuesday 
she said in a letter to capital citiesabc president thomas 
murphy that coverage of the citys drugrelated crime wave by the 
network and the station represents a vicious pattern of seemingly 
calculated malicious maligning of the districts black community in 
general and young black males in particular 
the citys population is 67 percent black according to police 
statistics 350 of the record 372 people slain in the city in 1988 
were black and through may 2 of this year 149 of the 170 killed 
were black 
winter who is black said repeated broadcasts portraying blacks 
as drug dealers and users has hurt employment and jobtraining 
prospects for local blacks 
basically were surprised and disappointed that she would 
reach this conclusion said wjla president mike moore 
certainly well take the matter seriously and discuss it 
internally and with the network 
copies of the letter were sent to attorney general dick 
thornburgh and federal communications commission chairman dennis 
patrick murphy thornburgh and patrick could not be immediately 
reached for comment 
abcs nightline recently aired a program on city crime 
titled dc divided city it included film footage of black 
homicide victims black teenagers being arrested on drug charges 
and black youths allegedly selling drugs 
the show also included a film prepared by three black high 
school students that showed whites in the georgetown section 
reacting with fear when asked for change or directions by the 
students 
a segment of the program included statements by crime experts 
who said whites make up a majority of the nations drug users

teachers all over china grumble about their 
miserable pay but those in henan province also are subjected to 
physical violence 
the guangming daily the national newspaper for intellectuals 
reported about the violence against in a frontpage article tuesday 
with the headline the disgrace of the cradle of civilization 
a section of cadres and the masses look down on learning and 
their concept of despising education has not fundamentally 
changed it said 
intellectuals once considered the elite in china have had low 
social status since the communists came to power 40 years ago 
during the cultural revolution of 196676 they were called the 
stinking ninth class 
from the beginning of 1988 through april 1989 there were 156 
incidents of teachers being beaten or otherwise injured or 
humiliated in henan the paper reported it said three of the 
teachers died and 13 suffered serious injuries 
among those attacked was zhang xipei a high school principal 
who tried in february 1988 to expel a girl who insisted on carrying 
a dagger to school it said 
her uncle went to zhangs house with a group of men and egged 
them on with with shouts of ruthlessly attack 500 yuan for 
breaking a leg 1000 yuan for gouging out an eye the guangming 
daily reported the top reward of 1000 yuan is about 270 
zhang and his daughter were seriously injured 
although the government says it is committed to improving the 
living standard of teachers their pay typically is only half that 
of factory workers 
violence is nothing new to teachers in henan in 1987 the china 
education newspaper reported more than 200 cases of teachers being 
beaten

a government report delivered to congress on 
tuesday confirms earlier projections the prescription drug program 
under the new medicare catastrophic care program will run about 3 
billion short by 1993 
the report by the department of health and human services 
projects that over the first four years of the program benefit 
payments will exceed premium revenues by nearly 1 billion or 3 
billion including administrative costs 
new benefits under the program will expand coverage of 
prescription drugs received outside of the hospital beginning jan 
1 1991 the program includes a schedule of copayments by 
beneficiaries 
the drug benefits will be financed partly by an increase in the 
monthly flatrate premium paid by those eligible for medicare 
which rose to 4 this year and is scheduled to go up to 490 in 
1990 and 740 in 1991 
money for the benefits also come from a surtax on income taxes 
of on medicare beneficiaries the maximum surtax on any person is 
800 this year or 1600 for a couple if both spouses are eligible 
a congressional budget office report recently estimated that 
these revenues would bring 49 billion more than is needed to fund 
the catastrophic illness benefits and build up a reserve 
the report prompted sen lloyd bentsen dtexas to suggest that 
premiums for the new program could be cut president bush however 
opposed the idea saying the surplus might be needed because of 
projections that the expanded drug benefits are underfunded

a new study tuesday by a securities and 
exchange commission economist found that computerized trading 
strategies influenced stock prices in the days leading up to the 
oct 19 1987 crash but not on the day of the crash 
the study prepared by sec economist dean furbush and by custom 
not adopted as a formal position by the commission is the latest 
contribution to what has been a hotly debated point 
those who advocate combining the regulation of stock and stock 
index futures markets under one agency have maintained that 
lighteningfast trading of huge quantities of stocks and futures 
contracts contributed to the record 508point plunge in the dow 
jones average of industrial stocks 
although separate federal agencies continue to regulate stock 
and futures markets the exchanges have agreed among themselves to 
suspend trading across markets when prices plunge in one of the 
markets 
a presidential task force headed by nicholas f brady now 
treasury secretary found last year that just a few institutional 
investors using a computertrading strategy known as portfolio 
insurance played a dominant role during the stock crash 
the sec in an earlier study said program trading while not 
causing the crash made it faster and worse than it would have been 
however the commodity futures trading commission which fought 
a successful turf war to maintain its power over the trading of 
stock futures contracts found in its study that program trading 
does not appear to have played a major role in the crash 
furbush who examined the relationship of stock and futures 
trading at fiveminute intervals from oct 14 to oct 20 partly 
backs that view finding greater price declines were not found to 
occur systematically during times of more intensive program 
trading on oct 19 
however he said the volume of program trading was 
related to stock price changes on oct 14 15 and 16 
furbush said by oct 19 the relationship between the stock and 
futures markets was breaking down and on oct 20 when the new york 
stock exchange had suspended use of its computerized trading 
system the volume of program trading declined dramatically

vietnamese troops have not withdrawn 
from areas near the cambodianthai border and are still shelling 
refugee camps there according to the khmer rouge guerrillas 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach during a recent 
visit to bangkok said vietnam had pulled its troops back to points 
at least 19 miles from the border vietnam has said it began the 
withdrawal from the border zone in late 1987 as a peace gesture to 
thailand 
the khmer rouge the largest cambodian guerrilla force said in 
a broadcast that the vietnamese statements were false 
a text of sundays broadcast was obtained in bangkok on tuesday 
it said 
when nguyen co thach released that statement the cambodian 
resistance forces and the vietnamese aggressor troops were fighting 
vigorously and fiercely along the border 
the hanoi troops stationed along the border fired thousands of 
artillery shells into cambodian refugee camps in thailand killing 
and wounding a number of residents 
at times vietnamese soldiers even intruded into thai 
territory such as in the pailin area there was no independent 
confirmation of the khmer rouge claims 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted the radical 
khmer rouge that had ruled the country since the spring of 1975 and 
set up another communist government 
the khmer rouge came to power by defeating the usbacked 
cambodian government during its brief rule up to 2 million 
cambodians were killed in purges or died of starvation 
after the vietnamese action the khmer rouge reverted to 
guerrilla warfare and subsequently formed a fractious resistance 
coalition with supporters of prince norodom sihanounk and 
anticommunist forces of former premier son sann 
another khmer rouge broadcast sunday repeated the rejection of 
recent peace proposals and a ceasefire 
the broadcast said what the vietnamese have done is only to 
change their appearance with the aim of fooling international 
opinion but their administrative and military networks remain the 
same from top to bottom in cambodia 
at a meeting last week in indonesia sihanouk and cambodian 
premier hun sen agreed to a thai proposal that the cambodian 
factions observe a ceasefire before the complete withdrawal of the 
vietnamese from cambodia 
vietnam with up to 70000 soldiers in cambodia has pledged to 
remove all of its military forces by sept 30 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan said monday a ceasefire could 
only be part of an overall solution 
we cannot accept a ceasefire that keeps in place a puppet 
regime he said of the hun sen government 
hun sen has ruled out khmer rouge participation in any 
provisional government

the air force agreed tuesday to maintain its 
fleet of hurricane hunters for the next two years reversing 
defense secretary dick cheneys plans to scrap weather 
reconnaissance flights in the midst of the hurricane season 
lawmakers said 
its a good resolution of the problem sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas said late tuesday after a group of coastal states 
lawmakers met with acting air force secretary jack welch and other 
officials of the pentagon and national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
noaa and the air force will attempt to work out an agreement 
over the next two years on which agency would eventually man the 
planes that fly into the eye of a hurricane lawmakers said 
it has been suggested the hurricane hunters become the 
responsibility of noaa but bentsen and others contend the agency 
would be unable to take over the program on such quick notice 
cheney said the flights used to predict the intensity and 
position of an approaching hurricane were not a defense mission 
and sought to save at least 14 million annually by slashing the 
program 
but lawmakers complained that phasing it out this summer would 
leave hurricaneprone regions dangerously exposed 
rep greg laughlin dtexas said keeping the hurricane hunters 
is to the american citizens benefit so they know whether the 
hurricane has the intensity to require an evacuation 
the pentagon officials told the group the air force decided to 
eliminate the program because they thought they had an agreement 
with noaa for it to assume responsibility for the hurricane 
hunters and there was no agreement laughlin said after the 
closeddoor session 
rep tom lewis rfla said we feel theres no way peacetime 
dollars can be better spent 
cheney had recommended the air force halt the reconnaissance 
flights by oct 1 when the new fiscal year begins 
in testimony before a house committee last week national 
hurricane center director robert c sheets said the aircraft are 
the only means of making direct measurements of location strength 
and windfield distributions critical to the hurricane forecast and 
warning process

two chemists went before 1800 colleagues to 
bolster their claim of achieving nuclear fusion at room 
temperature but failed to sway doubters and admitted problems 
plague some of their measurements 
i think theyre clearly on the ropes at this point 
physicist steven koonin of the california institute of technology 
in pasadena said tuesday after the presentation by martin 
fleischmann and b stanley pons 
however koonin said the possible achievement of 
roomtemperature fusion in an experiment by pons and fleischmanns 
scientific rival steven jones of brigham young university is 
looking pretty good and there may be some real physics there 
there is growing evidence indicating that experiments conducted 
by jones may have created roomtemperature fusion but not enough 
to heat anything koonin said 
pons of the university of utah and fleischmann of englands 
southampton university announced march 23 that they had created 
nuclear fusion in a flask 
such an accomplishment if confirmed could lead to a cheap 
virtually inexhaustible source of energy 
however pons and fleischmann are facing a growing number of 
critics who have attacked their experimental measurements and 
conclusions 
their appearance monday night at the electrochemical society 
incs meeting at the westin bonaventure hotel had been billed as 
the pairs opportunity to present new evidence to substantiate 
their claims 
instead pons and fleischmann acknowledged they may have made 
errors in their measurements of neutrons and gamma radiation during 
their experiments at the university of utah 
we are well aware those measurements are deficient 
fleischmann said 
he and pons also said their most recent experiments yielded 10 
to 50 times more energy than was consumed to operate their fusion 
device in their march announcement they said they had produced 
four times more energy 
unlike fission which generates energy by splitting the atom 
fusion generates tremendous energy by fusing two atoms together it 
is the process occurring in the sun and hydrogen bombs 
most efforts to achieve fusion have focused on forcing atoms 
together by brute force using multimilliondollar machines 
operating at extremely high temperature and pressure 
but pons and fleischmann claimed they created fusion by finesse 
using relatively simple laboratory equipment to coax hydrogen atoms 
to fuse in a lowlevel electric field 
their apparatus sent an electrical current through an electrode 
made of palladium and wrapped with platinum while immersed in heavy 
water which is made with a form of hydrogen called deuterium 
koonin said that while jones experiments measured atoms fusing 
at a rate of about one per second the heat described by pons and 
fleischmann would require a fusion rate of about onehundred 
trillion fusions per second 
experimental findings presented at the meeting particularly by 
researchers at texas aampm university tend to confirm jones but 
they wouldnt confirm pons and fleischmann koonin said 
something real is happening here said robert huggins of 
stanford university noting that he got 40 percent more heat from 
his experiment than he put into it 
several other scientists at the meeting said they successfully 
produced excess heat or other signs of fusion such as neutrons 
but stopped short of saying their studies proved fusion had 
happened 
many major laboratories have been unable to duplicate pons and 
fleischmanns results 
there is no fusion one of their most vocal critics caltech 
chemist nathan lewis said at mondays meeting 
he disputed claims by pons and fleischmann that their device 
produced excess heat or that it yielded byproducts of fusion 
including helium tritium neutrons and gamma rays 
fleischmann and pons disputed lewis and other critics who 
accused them of sloppiness in their measurements and pons said 
scientists unable to duplicate their experiments failed to use 
large enough palladium electrodes 
but fleischmann added i have always been ready to 
acknowledge the fact our experiments could be faulty if we turn 
out to be wrong ill be the first to admit it 
he acknowledged that evidence of gamma radiation was the least 
satisfactory part of their research we are doing a complete 
new set of measurements with improved techniques he said 
nevertheless they maintained their experiments generated excess 
heat

the us governments spokesman in havana smuggled 
cuban art into this country in a scheme partly intended to benefit 
members of the caribbean nations government a federal 
prosecutors spokeswoman said tuesday 
no arrests have been made and the investigation is continuing 
but cuban paintings and records have been seized from an art dealer 
here said diane cossin spokeswoman for us attorney dexter 
lehtinen 
a us customs service affidavit said jerry w scott the 
spokesman for the us interests section in havana brought the 
paintings into this country in violation of the cuban trade embargo 
we have a lot of documents records and other evidence to go 
over ms cossin said its not over yet by any means 
the us information agency for which scott worked in havana as 
the sections media spokesman praised scotts job performance 
hes got a good record said spokesman william reinckens 
reinckens said no disciplinary action was planned he said he 
could not discuss the merits of the case against scott who now 
works in washington 
in washington the state department refused to comment and 
referred calls back to customs 
the paintings were seized friday from ramon cernuda owner of 
the editorial cernuda art gallery in miami after an affidavit 
sworn by customs agent peter d liston was submitted to a federal 
magistrate 
cernuda has said the investigation is prompted by his opposition 
to the powerful cuban american national foundation a powerful 
militantly anticastro lobbying group 
customs began its investigation following publicity about an 
april 1988 auction at the cuban museum of art and culture in miami 
which allegedly involved cernudaowned cuban paintings liston said 
in the affidavit 
cuban art is being smuggled into the united states for 
personal gain and allegedly to profit members of the cuban 
government liston said 
liston said that by bidding prices up at art auctions and 
private sales cubas government which holds the largest amount of 
cuban artwork realizes the greater economic benefits 
the affidavit did not distinguish between members of the cuban 
government or the government officials would not comment tuesday 
on that saying the investigation is continuing 
the probe determined that some paintings had made their way to 
cernuda from scott 
the united states has no formal relations with cuba but 
maintains the interests section to handle such things as visas and 
routine legal transactions 
liston said that in february 1988 scott brought 40 paintings 
into miami international airport and failed to declare to customs 
inspectors that he was bringing cuban art into this country in 
violation of regulations 
the cuban provision of the trading with the enemy act prohibits 
virtually all commerce with cuba after 1963 the agent said 
scott acknowledged to liston last april 28 that he had handed 
the paintings over to cernuda the agent said scott then called 
cernuda who confirmed he still had the artworks 
cernuda also bought paintings from guido adriaenssens who 
smuggled about 100 paintings into the united states the affidavit 
alleged 
this is absurd said cernudas attorney ted klein the 
us attorney should hang his head in shame for attempting to seize 
artwork which is basically intellectual property that is no 
different than books or records or motion pictures or magazines 
anyone convicted of trading with the enemy could be sentenced to 
up to 10 years in prison and fined 250000 for each violation the 
us attorneys office said

soldiers loyal to the 3yearold civilian 
government on tuesday snuffed out the second attempted military 
coup in a year without firing a shot 
president vinicio cerezo asked guatemalans to remain calm 
saying the situation is under the control of the government and 
the army of guatemala 
the capital was calm by midafternoon with tanks and soldiers off 
the streets and business back to normal 
defense minister alejandro gramajo said rebel air force troops 
backed by two helicopter gunships and an a37 warplane blocked two 
major highways on the south and northeast edges of the capital 
gramajo said rebel troops also tried to march on his home 
he said the rebels turned back when they encountered a superior 
force of loyalist troops 
the defense chief said at least 300 rebel soldiers were 
involved he gave no other troop figures 
the rebellion was crushed without a shot being fired cerezo 
told a news conference hours after the uprising 
cerezo and gramajo said the attempt was staged by an air force 
tactical unit based at the international airort south of guatemala 
city it was led by at least 10 current retired or cashiered 
military officers including several who took part in a failed 
uprising on may 11 1988 they reported 
in that attempt two columns of troops marched on guatemala city 
but were turned back without gunfire six officers were arrested 
gramajo said two colonels a captain and a major cashiered for 
taking part in last years attempt were involved in tuesdays 
rebellion 
the officers came up with this way of celebrating last 
years coup attempt and keeping the movement alive he said 
cerezo and gramajo said all but two highranking officers 
involved in tuesdays plot were in custody an unspecified number 
of soldiers were also arrested 
the president said civilians apparently were not involved as 
they were last year 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
voiced strong continued us support for the government 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he received reports the real target may have been gramajo or 
another minister gramajo repeatedly has said the time has come for 
real civilian government in guatemala 
guatemala never has sustained a modern democratic govenment it 
is widely agreed civilian authority now exists only with military 
consent and supervision 
gramajo said loyalist troops tanks and artillery took up 
defensive positions at strategic sites after the plot surfaced at 
about 5 am 
loyalist troops identified themselves by wearing blue kerchiefs 
at their necks most of them returned to barracks by 830 am 
after the rebel aircraft returned to base 
cerezo said rebels tried to seize radio and tv to broadcast a 
communique he refused to divulge the contents saying it would be 
used as evidence in military tribunal proceedings 
gramajo told the associated press in august the army is doing 
everything possible so that the era of coups pertains to the past 
nonetheless the traditional forces are doing everything possible 
so that it does not as of now im winning 
the traditional forces are rightist landowners and business 
people who forged strong alliances with the military during years 
of military rule 
cerezo 46 a christian democrat took office in january 1986 
heading the first elected civilian administration in 16 years his 
term ends in 1991 
the right wing attacked him for his economic policy 
particularly on tax reform and for trying to open talks with 
leftists who have waged guerrilla war for 30 years 
on april 16 cerezo blamed rightist paramilitary groups for a 
growing wave of violence 
the international community widely shunned guatemala because of 
human rights abuses during military rule here 
the armed forces and death squads linked to the military were 
blamed for killing tens of thousands of people many of them 
indians who make up more than half of guatemalas 85 million 
people the army denies it 
the central american nation about the size of tennessee is 
bounded on the north and west by mexico the south by the pacific 
ocean and the east by el salvador honduras and belize 
guatemala refuses to say how big its standing army is but the 
international institute for strategic studies estimated total 
combined security and defense forces at 52000 at the end of 1987

office identified the suspect only as enrique calzada he was 
picked up by police monday evening in mexico city campos said 
campos said calzada was the boyfriend of one of the women ring 
members nicknamed carla 
carla is the nickname of maria del rocio cuevas guerra 43 
who along with four other people was arrested at a mexico city 
apartment saturday after a gun battle with police 
police refused to disclose the identities of two other women 
arrested late monday saying they were being questioned and that 
their depositions had not been completed

anonymity said police sought several more suspects for 
questioning in connection with the satanic cult slayings at a ranch 
outside matamoros mexico

who authorities described as the cults godmother omar 
francisco orea 23 a journalism student at the national 
university dr maria de lourdes guero lopez 29 a physician and 
alvaro de leon valdez 22 
the cults godfather adolfo de jesus constanzo and a

british embassies 
the eight suspects being held have been booked on charges of 
homicide criminal association wounding a police agent during the 
arrest and property damage campos said their arraingment was to 
take place late tuesday and had been delayed because of paperwork

authorities told a tale of bizarre rituals human and animal 
sacrifices and the boiling of brains and other organs by the cult 
they said constanzo 26 and ms aldrete a former honor student 
at texas southmost college in brownsville texas directed the 
sacrifices but ms aldrete denied involvement in the killings 
during two appearences before reporters this week 
cult members said they were convinced the rituals would protect 
them from police while they smuggled marijuana into the united 
states 
hundreds of us and mexican law enforcement agents had searched 
for the couple since april 11 when mexican police discovered the 
buried bodies of the 15 victims at the remote ranch near matamoros 
the arrested cult members told officials that constanzo 
convinced police were closing in on him began throwing handfuls of 
50 and 100 bills out of the apartment window and took potshots at 
passersby who stopped to pick them up 
constanzo then ordered de leon valdez to kill him and his 
henchman martin quintana rodriguez de leon valdez said constanzo 
slapped him when he hesitated at first he killed them both with a 
burst of automatic weapon fire and stuffed their bodies in a closet

in need of voters 
the three selectmen the town moderator the town clerk and the

sufficient number of registered voters

the house voted easy approval tuesday of a 
bill bankrolling vocational education programs but only after 
adding an amendment permitting voluntary prayer in the schools 
the bill passed 4023 provides 14 billion for combined 
academic and vocational education 
it provides money to states and to local school districts based 
on a complicated formula which gives advantages to disadvantaged 
and handicapped students 
before passing the bill the house voted 269135 approval of an 
amendment by rep william e dannemeyer rcalif denying any 
money to programs which have a policy of denying or which 
effectively prevents participation in prayer in public schools by 
individuals on a voluntary basis would be denied funds that 
amendment passed by a 269135 vote with 31 members not voting 
it was just an opportunity it was a lastminute thing it 
caught everybody by surprise said paul mero a spokesman for 
dannemeyer 
mero said the amendment is a prelude to a proposed 
constitutional amendment for voluntary school prayer which he said 
dannemeyer will soon offer 
the bill makes some changes in the way the money would be 
administered for example it eliminates most of the specific 
categories known as setasides 
a compromise hold harmless amendment addressed concerns 
expressed by some members that no school district be drastically 
cut or get an unexpected windfall in the new funding formula 
that formula provides an increase from the current 32 percent to 
80 percent of federal money is passed through from the state level 
to local school districts community colleges and area schools 
the amendment offered by rep william goodling rpa would 
phase in the new formula over three years with no school district 
being allocated less than 80 percent of what it received in the 
preceding fiscal year 
the senate also has passed legislation reauthorizing federal 
funding for vocational education 
both measures now go to a conference committee where one 
education committee staffer predicted the voluntary prayer 
provision would be dropped

a gunman who went on a rampage at an 
elementary school last fall killing two children and wounding nine 
other people was sentenced tuesday to the electric chair 
james w wilson 20 showed no emotion during the sentencing by 
circuit judge james moore asked earlier if he had a statement to 
make wilson replied i have nothing to say 
wilson pleaded guilty but mentally ill last month to two counts 
of murder and other charges stemming from the sept 26 shooting at 
the oakland elementary school 
wilson walked into the northwestern south carolina school and 
sprayed the cafeteria and a classroom with gunfire killing 
classmates shequila bradley and tequila thomas both 8 and 
wounding seven students and two teachers 
the sentence brought sighs of relief from relatives of the 
victims 
im happy im satisfied said a tearful linda davis whose 
8yearold son joseph was among the wounded 
wilsons father james said he was disappointed in the 
sentence noting that his son has suffered from mental illness 
since he was 14 
psychiatrists who examined wilson testified during his 
competency hearing last month that he had a borderline personality 
disorder an illness bordering on schizophrenia 
defense attorneys had asked for a life sentence with psychiatric 
treatment for their client prosecutors sought the death penalty 
state chief deputy attorney general donald zelenka said the 
judge clearly found that wilson knew what he was doing at the time 
of the rampage 
moore also sentenced wilson to 175 years in prison on nine 
counts of assault and battery and one count of carrying a gun into 
a school 
all death penalty cases in south carolina are automatically

eleemosynary means charitable but its 
also the pretentious title of a not quite successful 
threecharacter drama by lee blessing author of a walk in the 
woods 
the play which opened offbroadway on tuesday at manhattan 
theater clubs stage ii is about uneasy relationships something 
blessing also focused on in a walk in the woods instead of 
dealing with sovietamerican arms control negotiators 
eleemosynary looks at three generations of women all of them 
desperate overachievers 
the most interesting and most eccentric is the grandmother 
dorothea played by eileen heckart an actress too long absent from 
the new york stage 
dorothea compensates for her unfulfilled marriage by 
relentlessly celebrating the bizarre fortunetellers outofbody 
experiences trying to teach her infant granddaughter latin and 
greek or telling her daughter she can really fly if shell only 
jump off a water tower while she films the flight miss heckart 
revels in the characters strangeness 
dorotheas forcefulness smothers daughter artie joanna gleason 
who eventually distances herself from her mother as well as her own 
daughter echo jennie moreau artie eventually flees from both of 
them finding refuge in a research job abroad 
she can only communicate with her daughter by phone and then 
its only to quiz her in spelling rather than talk about anything 
personal 
all of this background is told by blessing in what amounts to 
crosscut monologues there is minimal interaction between the 
three women with most of their speeches directed to the audience 
the play compressed into one long act is episodic and not 
necessarily chronological or even dramatically compelling 
eleemosynary hinges on a national spelling bee which the 
teenage echo enters with a vengeance both mother and grandmother 
are alarmed at the girls vicious competitiveness as she battles 
her way to the championship the championship match is the plays 
best scene and miss moreau projects the scary singlemindedness of 
a true believer 
miss gleason has the dramas most unappealing role a mother 
always running from her family or any kind of emotional commitment 
she manages to make arties plight sympathetic even if the 
character isnt 
the women are constantly at war with each other and their 
battles eventually grow tiresome especially when presented in 
snippets of scenes that dont allow the action to build director 
lynn meadow has almost choreographed the drama with the ladies 
running in and out of the nearly bare playing area all the time 
the playwright resists sentimentality until the end of the 
evening when he stretches for a hopeful if not a happy ending 
eleemosynary is graced by three exceptional actresses who do 
their best to find the drama and humor in blessings uneven play

a 2yearold boy born without ribs on his 
right side is the first person to be given expandable titanium ribs 
designed by a texas doctor that will help him live a normal life 
doctors said tuesday 
christopher cardenas was on a respirator for his first seven 
months until pins and a plastic sheath were implanted to keep his 
organs in place the specially designed ribs were implanted last 
month 
dr robert campbell a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at santa 
rosa childrens hospital who developed the expandable rib led a 
threemember team during the sixhour operation april 13 
two expandable ribs were inserted vertically and can be expanded 
with minor surgery when the boy begins to grow campbell said he 
said two were sufficient 
we hope he will be absolutely normal he is running playing 
and falling down with the rest of the children campbell said at 
a news conference 
doctors waited nearly a month to make the announcement so they 
could monitor the childs progress said hospital spokeswoman 
terrie carter 
christopher was born with virtually no ribs or muscles on his 
right side and part of his spine also was missing there were small 
ribs at the neck and the waist but seven ribs in the middle of his 
chest were missing 
for his first seven months christopher was on a respirator his 
parents gus and monica cardenas went to doctors at santa rosa 
childrens hospital in august 1987 
the babys organs were shifting and causing the spine to curve 
so campbell and dr melvin smith a pediatric surgeon implanted 
two 3inchlong vertical pins and a plastic sheath to hold 
christophers organs in place 
campbell said he knew a replacement would have to be inserted 
so he began designing a new implant 
it cost about 20000 to develop the ribs said dave martinez 
an engineer with techmedica inc a camarillo califbased 
artificial joint firm that worked with campbell 
campbell said the couples insurance would pay for the device 
the expandable ribs were attached to the small ribs at the neck 
and waist said campbell 
resembling expandable wrist watch bands the ribs can be 
extended when needed as christopher grows and then locked in 
position 
campbell said titanium is stronger than steel and the ribs will 
be totally safe 
the primary design factor was safety he said i have five 
kids myself and i knew they fall so i designed this for maximum 
safety and combat conditions 
christopher who attended the news conference with his mother 
appeared shy at first but was running around the room by the end of 
the session 
mrs cardenas said she and her husband had gone to doctors in 
san antonio austin and houston and were told that a respirator 
would be part of her sons life 
then they talked to the santa rosa physicians when we ran 
into these guys we were very grateful because all hope was about 
gone mrs cardenas said 
she said her son is a pretty typical 2yearold hes afraid 
of doctors and hospitals 
campbell said he has been contacted by other physicians who have 
patients with similar rib difficulties but did not know when he 
would perform more implants

the mother of an infant whose death was 
linked to cocaine abuse during pregnancy has been charged with 
involuntary manslaughter and the prosecutor defended his action 
tuesday against growing criticism 
the actions of this office reflect the concern sometimes the 
outrage of this community that children are born at risk both 
at birth and for many years said winnebago county states 
attorney paul logli 
but medical and social services officials said the charge could 
backfire and prevent cocaineabusing motherstobe from seeking 
help 
its the incorrect approach you want to develop an atmosphere 
where they know they can come into the healthcare system and not 
be penalized a punitive approach is not going to benefit the 
children said dr ira j chasnoff at northwestern university 
medical school who has directed studies on the effects of prenatal 
cocaine use 
if the procedure becomes common enough it could very well 
drive these cocaineabusing mothers underground said spokesman 
dave schneidman of the state department of children and family 
services he noted that the state had 1233 cocaine babies in 1988 
90 percent of of them in cook county which includes chicago 
logli said there had been 27 cocaineexposed infants since last 
summer in rockford illinois secondlargest city with about 
150000 people that is up from nine the previous year 
he filed the involuntary manslaughter charge monday against 
melanie green 24 later released on 3500 bond an autopsy found 
that her baby bianca died two days after birth feb 2 of oxygen 
deprivation linked to cocaine exposure late in the pregnancy 
ms green who does not yet have an attorney also was charged 
with delivery of a controlled substance to a minor logli said 
involuntary manslaughter is a felony punishible by two to five 
years in prison the prosecutor said ms green could face a 14year 
maximum penalty if she is convicted of the drug charge arraignment 
is scheduled may 31 logli said 
laws that threaten or actually punish women for actions 
during their pregnancy are contrary both to the constitution and 
common sense said lynn paltrow with the american civil liberties 
unions division of reproductive rights in new york 
if our society is really concerned about prenatal health care 
the last thing they want to do is terrify women away from 
proper care 
but logli defended his action 
my job as a prosecutor is simply to charge those events where 
violation of the law works toward the harm of others logli said 
if it spurs some debate in society that leads to improving 
prenatal care then it will come to good effect 
its the second time this month that a woman in this city has 
been taken to court for exposing her fetus to cocaine which can 
cause numerous health problems including low birth weight impaired 
motor ability irritability that can hinder learning strokes and 
seizures 
on may 1 a judge convicted a juvenile mother of child abuse and 
neglect for such exposure the child who shows no ill effects at 3 
months was temporarily removed from its mothers custody 
those charges were filed not to punish the mother but to 
protect the child logli said 
but when a child dies after events that occurred while the 
child was still in the womb the law provides protection for that 
child and allows for prosecution of the person who causes those 
events he said 
in december a florida woman was charged with child abuse and 
delivery of drug after her child was born addicted to cocaine the 
child survived prosecutors said it was the first such felony drug 
case there 
in 1987 a judge in california dismissed a charge of failure to 
provide medical care to a child lodged against a woman whose son 
was born brain damaged and later died prosecutors had accused her 
of ignoring a doctors advice not to abuse drugs

residents of this burgeoning 
golfandtennis resort refused tuesday to clamp down on growth by 
tying construction to how long motorists have to wait at lights 
the referendum for limited development received 9364 negative 
votes or 68 percent to 2995 or 32 percent in favor said town 
clerk tommy malone 
as far as we know this kills this particular issue ms 
malone said we were really surprised at the outcome we expected 
it to be very close 
however the measures author former town councilman don hook 
said he had not ruled out the possibility of future referendums 
ms malone said earlier that she expected a turnout of 50 
percent to 60 percent of the islands 14500 registered voters 
the measure would have frozen building permits if traffic as 
measured at any of several specified locations slowed such that 
drivers must wait more than two turns of a traffic light during the 
peak of the tourist season in june 
the moratorium would have been lifted once steps to alleviate 
the congestion were undertaken 
proponents said it would put some teeth into a planning 
ordinance approved by residents three years ago opponents say the 
ordinance already is strong and that a moratorium would cost jobs 
and hurt the local economy 
the population on this 12 by 5mile seaside resort has grown 
from 6500 yearround residents in 1975 to an estimated 20000 
today about 11 million tourists visit the island each year 
according to the chamber of commerce 
the state attorney generals office indicated the measure was 
probably unconstitutional because it could deprive property owners 
of the use of their property without compensation 
the measure was placed on the ballot after author hook and 11 
other islanders mounted a petition drive to take the issue to the 
voters 
last month the council approved 61 a resolution urging 
islanders to reject the measure 
a telephone survey by the island packet newspaper in february 
indicated that some 38 percent of those polled were undecided about 
the issue

a coalition of civil rights organizations 
voiced its opposition tuesday to the appointment of william lucas 
to head the justice departments civil rights division 
the leadership conference on civil rights said lucas doesnt 
have the experience or litigation skills needed in the position 
which is the federal governments top civil rights job 
the conference is an umbrella group of 180 organizations and the 
opposition was adopted by consensus at a meeting of the 
conference according to ralph neas executive director of the 
organization 
neas and benjamin hooks chairman of the conference said in a 
statement that lucas may well be qualified for other important 
positions in the federal government but he does not have the 
experience the substantive knowledge of the increasingly technical 
field of civil rights or the litigation skills to carry out the 
duties effectively 
the opposition was the latest round in the controversy swirling 
around lucas a black detroit lawyer lucas 61 also has been an 
fbi agent sheriff of wayne county mich and the chief executive 
of that county 
lucas is being backed for the post by attorney general dick 
thornburgh civil rights activist jesse jackson some members of 
the congressional black caucus and the rev joseph lowery 
president of the southern christian leadership conference 
but the nomination of lucas a democratturnedrepublican who 
lost a race for the michigan governors post in 1986 has been 
opposed by the national association for the advancement of colored 
people the nations oldest and largest civil rights group 
the leadership conference position said the organization would 
work to persuade the us senate to withhold confirmation of the 
nomination once it is proposed by president bush 
rep john conyers a black democrat from detroit recently said 
a senate fight by civil rights groups opposed to lucas would be 
counterproductive

the space shuttle atlantis 
returned from orbit in excellent shape with only about 100 nicks 
in its thermal tiles and scuffed tires from a crosswind landing a 
nasa official said tuesday 
gusty winds up to 25 mph blew sand across rogers dry lake as 
technicians worked on atlantis a day after landing but work was on 
or ahead of schedule and the shuttle was expected to be flown back 
to florida on saturday 
the spaceship looks really good said conrad nagel of the 
national aeronautics and space administration who is in charge of 
processing the shuttle 
only 12 of the shuttles protective thermal tiles were likely to 
need replacement nagel said 
in comparison after atlantis previous mission in december 
1988 there were 1000 nicks and 162 tiles needed to be replaced 
we feel like were in very very good shape nagel said 
one window was found to have a nick measuring 08 inch in 
diameter it was being studied to determine if it could be polished 
out or would require more extensive repair 
atlantis blasted off thursday from kennedy space center in 
florida and delivered the magellan probe into orbit the probe was 
then fired onto an 800 millionmile trajectory to venus 
the crew also performed a metal crystalization experiment and 
photographed lightning and pollution on earth until one of its four 
operating computers malfunctioned on sunday 
the crew replaced the computer with a spare and landed safely 
monday 
the broken computer was being removed from the orbiter and would 
be sent to the manufacturer for inspection nagel said 
atlantis landed in a crosswind of 8 knots or 92 mph giving 
nasa the data it has long sought on how shuttles handle in 
crosswinds the information is needed before nasa can resume 
landings in florida and thus eliminate the need to ferry shuttles 
back from california piggyback on a boeing 747 
senior nasa officials have said however that they do not 
intend to soon abandon edwards enormous and forgiving lakebed with 
its choice of numerous runways 
the crosswind landing did cause scuffing of the tires 
particularly the left outboard tire nagel said 
the brakes also apparently came through in good condition they 
had yet to be removed but no telltale noises were heard during the 
snailpace twohour tow of the 122footlong 97ton shuttle from 
the runway to the nasa facility on the edge of the lakebed 
a valve in a helium system could not be closed after landing 
the helium will be purged before the ferry flight nagel said 
atlantis will be hoisted onto the back of nasas boeing 747 and 
is scheduled to take off at 7 am saturday for what is hoped to be 
a oneday flight back to florida 
a delayed start would mean a stopover en route 
we really have no major issues or concerns with the orbiter 
nagel said 
atlantis may have come through with fewer problems than any of 
the shuttle flights since the hiatus caused by the jan 28 1986 
explosion of the challenger 
i would say that right now we probably plan on doing less with 
atlantis this time than we have done with any of the three previous 
flights that weve had since weve returned to flight nagel said

after 10 dynamite explosions in as many 
days a grain elevator has finally yielded a large section to 
demolition crews 
attempts began more than a week ago to topple the 110foot 
concrete elevator built around the turn of the century but when 
the dust settled each time it still stood until monday when 
five of the 19 silos fell on tuesday five more silos came down 
after still more blasting 
now blasters are confident that days are numbered for the rest 
of the building too 
its going like clockwork now said teri odonoghue a 
spokeswoman for the land developer that owns the property 
we were hoping it would fall today but we werent positive 
jerry vann who is heading the demolition project said monday 
vann is president of blasting specialists inc a chicagobased 
company 
as the first silos collapsed nearby buildings shook and clouds 
of white dust puffed over the remaining concrete towers 
this is a beautiful sight said vann 
he had planned to spend only 10 days on the job instead vann 
has spent 30 days drilling and placing dynamite in the silos and 
nine days blasting at the elevators base 
he said he expects to topple the remaining columns by this 
weekend unless we get thunderstorms or bad weather 
the mccurdy peanut elevator is built of concrete up to two feet 
thick reinforced with heavy steel rods to withstand the force of 
a grain dust explosion officials said the peanut company bought 
the elevator from a grain company 
vann said he could have destroyed the silos sooner but city 
safety officials limited the amount of dynamite he could detonate 
at any one time 
we are working at this slow and steady so we dont endanger 
anything around here he said i would rather shoot four or 
five times just to make sure no one gets hurt 
a land developer intends to transform the grain elevators 
28acre site into a hotel and office development

london school of economics because of the uproar over his election 
winston silcott who is serving a 30year minimum prison 
sentence for the killing said in a statement released by his 
attorney that he was giving up the honor to spare his student 
supporters grief 
he thanked them but added i have no wish for them to be made 
scapegoats as i have been 
administrators at the famous college members of the governing 
conservative party and government officials had attacked the 
students election of silcott education secretary kenneth baker 
described it as a shameful and despicable action of the loony 
left 
however school officials said they did not have the authority 
to reverse it 
the campus chapter of the national union of students accepted 
silcotts resignation 
indraprasad patel college director said there would be a 
review of the relationship between the college and the student 
union to ensure such a thing never happens again he said the 
college had been gravely embarrassed by a small minority of 
students who gathered april 27 to pick silcott for the oneyear 
ceremonial term 
the students voted for him to express sympathy for his claims 
that he is innocent 
the 29yearold black and two other people were convicted of 
murdering a white police officer with machetes during a riot at a 
predominantly black housing project in north london in 1985

the government under gen manuel 
antonio noriega denounced international observers who said he stole 
the presidential election and it declared tuesday that its own 
candidate was ahead by almost two to one 
in washington president bush demanded that noriega heed the 
call of the people and abandon power bush said reports by us 
observers demonstrate clearly that despite massive irregularities 
at the polls the opposition has won a clearcut overwhelming 
victory in sundays election 
the opposition claims a 31 victory it said it was paying no 
attention to official results and offered to negotiate 
we are ready to enter a dialogue between civilians and the 
military to find a solution to the nations crisis ricardo arias 
calderon the opposition candidate for first vice president told a 
news conference monday 
government foes staged no further demonstrations and truckloads 
of troops coursed through the streets 
police broke up a brief confrontation between pro and 
antigovernment supporters at the home of archbishop marcos 
mcgrath the countrys roman catholic leader who was meeting with 
the opposition leadership 
walls telephone poles and palm trees still bore campaign 
posters but stores that were boarded up in anticipation of 
violence were reopening 
the government said noriegas candidate carlos duque was 
leading opposition candidate guillermo endara by 51752 to 26878 
with 12 of 40 districts reported 
the opposition released figures from its own pollwatchers saying 
it was leading by 236097 to 79260 with 358 percent of the vote 
counted 
retiree carlos halphen summed up an opinion expressed by many 
when asked what would happen next 
we want the united states to do something the us got us 
into this mess it should get us out he said 
us observers discussed with bush in washington options for 
putting more pressure on noriega to step down 
the united states has imposed damaging economic sanctions on the 
government but has been unable to oust noriega as commander of the 
15000strong defense forces and as de facto ruler 
this election was a terrible fraud on the panamanian people 
said rep larry smith rfla a member of an uninvited observer 
delegation sent by bush polls opened late peoples names were 
not on lists dead peoples names were on lists after years of not 
appearing on lists 
duque denounced obvious american intervention in affairs that 
concern only panama and said claims of stolen tallies were the 
stuff of a soap opera plot 
venezuelan government spokesman pastor heydra said in caracas 
that latin american foreign ministers will meet in lima peru 
possibly on wednesday to consider ousting panama from the 
regional group of eight organization because of the electoral fraud 
allegations the organization suspended panama after noriega 
engineered eric delvalles ouster as panamanian president in 
february 1988 
venezuela colombia argentina brazil uruguay peru and 
mexico belong to the group of eight which promotes political and 
economic integration in latin america 
panamas foreign minister jorge ritter accused washington late 
monday of creating a climate for military intervention his 
comments were broadcast on news reports tuesday 
the government frequently has accused the united states of 
plotting with the opposition to abrogate treaties under which 
panama would gain control of the panama canal at the end of the 
century 
former president jimmy carter who signed the treaties said 
monday that noriegas soldiers seized legitimate election returns 
and that the results being tallied were counterfeit 
he said he believed an exit poll conducted by the catholic 
church which had the opposition leading 31 was an accurate 
reflection of the true count 
carter left panama on tuesday morning after denouncing noriega 
as a dictator who was stealing the election from the panamanian 
people 
election tribunal spokesman boris moreno said tabulation board 
president diomedes rosas had told carter he was an invited guest 
and could not pass judgment give advice or issue conclusions 
carter stalked out moreno said 
noriega thought he was going to legitimize his regime 
instead it has been delegitimized said a us embassy official 
noriega himself kept silent on the results and met with 
government officials and acting president manuel solis palma who 
is to step down sept 1 
the vote counting center was surrounded tuesday by a large 
detachment of troops and truckmounted machine guns 
moreno said troops were brought in because the government feared 
rioting when more official results are announced 
on monday a protest march by more than 15000 people was broken 
up with gunfire and three people were wounded one seriously 
tuesday afternoon arias calderon endara and second vice 
presidential candidate guillermo ford visited mcgrath 
a few dozen armed paramilitary noriega supporters surrounded the 
house and dozens of endara supporters gathered but police 
scattered the crowd by firing shots in the air 
endara said the candidates told mcgrath of their desire for a 
peaceful solution 
ritter said the international press was painting a distorted 
picture of panama and complained about us southern command 
television station broadcasts 
the southern command station the only uncensored station left 
in panama was watched eagerly by many panamanians although it 
broadcasts only in english 
uspanama relations have been hostile since noriega 
orchestrated delvalles ouster last year the cia reportedly 
contributed 10 million to the opposition campaign 
delvalle tried to fire the general after he was indicted in 
florida on drugsmuggling and moneylaundering charges noriega 
claims the us charges are a smokescreen to keep the canal

roe vs wade is bound to start a lot of 
livingroom debates but one fact is inarguable this is as good 
as television drama gets 
nbcs story of the legalization of abortion airing monday is 
graced by emmyworthy performances down to the smallest supporting 
role and a courageous script that takes a stand without talking 
down to the other side 
holly hunter broadcast news stars as ellen russell a 
penniless drifter who has left an abusive husband and been forced 
to give her daughter to her mother to raise unmarried and pregnant 
again she faces the prospect of having to give up another baby for 
adoption 
hardly the most sympathetic case imaginable you have the 
morals of a cat snipes her mother she is nevertheless the only 
woman willing to allow two young female lawyers to use her case as 
a test of texas stringent antiabortion law 
the character of ellen is based on norma mccorvey the 
reallife thenanonymous jane roe who sued dallas district 
attorney henry wade for enforcing the law her case led to the 1973 
us supreme court decision legalizing abortion the supreme court 
recently heard arguments on a missouri case and the justices 
ruling this summer could effect the 1973 decision 
producers used pseudonyms for mccorvey her relatives and 
friends to protect their privacy since work on the script began 
three years ago however mccorvey has become a public critic of 
efforts to overturn the abortion decision 
other characters real names are used amy madigan field of 
dreams is excellent as sarah weddington the neophyte lawyer who 
successfully argues the case first before a panel of federal 
judges in texas they find the antiabortion law unconstitutionally 
vague but refuse to grant an injunction leaving the law on the 
books until the decision can be appealed and forcing ellen to 
continue with the pregnancy 
you might explain to me how it is you won and i lost says a 
distraught ellen when weddington calls to explain the decision to 
her 
the movie follows the dual struggles of russell as she is 
refused job after job because she is pregnant and weddington who 
finds plenty of support but scant actual help preparing the complex 
case for the high court her partner linda coffey annabella 
price has to virtually drop out because of the demands of other 
legal work 
by the time weddington argues the case before the supreme court 
in 1973 ellen has long since had her baby and given it up for 
adoption the only solution the state offers in the movies most 
powerful scene ellen vainly tugs at the delivery table restraints 
trying to get a glimpse of the baby as it is carried away she 
doesnt even know if its a boy or a girl 
ultimately because the movie tells the story of the women who 
won the case it cannot avoid being prochoice if you cant take 
care of a baby or arent ready to it shouldnt matter what the 
reasons are weddington argues at one point you shouldnt have 
to bear a child and give it up for adoption just because the state 
of texas says so 
but the other side is treated sympathetically through terry 
oquinns eloquently understated portrayal of jay floyd the 
assistant attorney general assigned the task of defending the texas 
law floyd like weddington has never argued before the supreme 
court the bachelor begins receiving mail from womens groups on 
weddingtons side one letter suggests he might understand the 
issue better if he had a uterus transplant 
i thought id write back that i may not have a uterus but i 
was definitely a baby floyd tells a colleague 
when the two lawyers go before the high court weddington has 
the force of conviction on her side floyd is still struggling with 
the issue he argues for the sanctity of human life pinpointing it 
as beginning a vague few days after conception 
thats really when the soul comes into the body if one 
believes in a soul i dont know he stammers afterward he is 
convinced that the court had already made up its mind has anyone 
ever presented so dazzling an argument that it brought them 
around he wonders 
no madefortv movie can be so dazzling as to change minds on an 
issue that touches people so deeply but producer michael manheim 
producerdirector gregory hoblit and producerwriter alison cross 
have run an emotional and political obstacle course and emerged 
with an exceptionally fine film whatever their point of view they 
should be congratulated for humanizing the issue and taking a stand 
where sticking to the middle ground just wouldnt do

a man who has seen them all television 
situation comedies that is says there was nobody like lucy 
comedian lucille ball who died april 26 of a ruptured aorta at 
the age of 77 became a legend because of tvs i love lucy 
which defined the sitcom genre when it first aired in 1951 and was 
the model for a host of shows that followed 
i love lucy was so successful three years as the no 1 
show that virtually every sitcom that came after it was an 
actcom until 1957 said richard taflinger a professor of 
communications at washington state university 
he said 90 percent of sitcoms are action comedies or 
actcoms they start with a disruption of the status quo and 
then follow the central characters actions as he or she tries to 
restore things to normal the character invariably causes further 
more humorous disruptions 
characters in actcoms are onedimensional unchanging and 
unthinking but the special ones such as lucy ricardo are 
hilariously entertaining taflinger said 
the penultimate actcom is of course i love lucy he said 
the redheaded actress and her first husband the late desi 
arnaz not only set the standard for comedy taflinger said they 
revolutionized television production by using three cameras in 
their california studio to film the show in sequence before a live 
audience 
they totally changed television forever he said 
sitcom episodes fill a sizable chunk of taflingers memory 
banks since he spent two years watching them seven hours a day 
few couch potatoes could match such viewing habits but taflinger 
was doing research for his book sitcom what it is and how it 
works 
ive watched at least one episode of every sitcom thats been 
on the air since 1950 about 500 or so he said 
taflinger has watched all 140 i love lucy episodes all 160 
of the dick van dyke show and all 200 of mash hes also 
analyzed obscure shortlived programs that few television viewers 
ever saw such as shirleys world which starred shirley 
maclaine for all of three episodes 
but taflinger said the series that had the briefest run was a 
tim conway vehicle called time out cloned from the popular 
laughin time out drew such a flood of complaints during 
its first 10 minutes on the air that the plug was pulled on the 
program halfway through its hourlong premiere 
sitcoms like jokes must meet specific criteria to be funny 
taflinger explained the formula says effective humor must 
appeal to the intellect rather than the emotions 
be inherently human 
have its basis in a familiar set of societal norms 
involve actions or dialogue inconsistent with those norms or 
unsuitable to the surroundings 
be perceived as harmless or painless to the participants 
the second type of sitcom was the domestic comedy which 
taflinger said began exploring character development with children 
becoming central to the plots father knows best was the first 
in 1957 and later successes included my three sons the 
brady bunch the courtship of eddies father family 
affair and family ties 
the toprated show of recent seasons has been the cosby 
show but taflinger said it isnt really a domestic comedy 
anymore 
im not entirely sure what it is he said its great fun 
to watch bill cosby do standup comedy but nothing happens they 
have no problems 
they simply live which is why its starting to slip in the 
ratings i think 
a number of sitcoms in between i love lucy and cosby 
that were built around other established stars have not enjoyed the 
huge popularity of those two series taflinger said the flops 
including shirley maclaines show the jimmy stewart show and 
the smith family starring henry fonda lacked good scripts and 
other necessary elements for a successful sitcom 
the same principle applied to recent illfated attempts at 
resurrecting tv veterans dick van dyke and mary tyler moore whose 
longrunning original series concluded with final episodes 
the very popular mork and mindy a spinoff of happy 
days faded quickly after it began relying too much on robin 
williams antics to carry the show taflinger said 
not even lucille ball whose return to series television in 1962 
with the lucy show later changed to heres lucy lasted 13 
years was immune from a flop her 1986 life with lucy sitcom 
drew low ratings and was canceled within two months 
her last sitcom really wasnt a very good show it depended 
more on the fact that it was lucy than on good writing and 
producing a good quality show taflinger said he also noted 
that at 75 she was unable to do the physical slapstick comedy 
with which lucy ricardo delighted audiences in the 50s 
plus in todays network market a show must succeed almost 
instantly or its canceled he said noting that the original van 
dyke show was nearly canceled after a few episodes but built an 
audience by the end of its first 13week season 
the rarest variety of sitcom is the dramatic comedy which must 
have wellrounded characters who are humorous but also think cry 
lose and sometimes die taflinger said there have only been a 
handful of dramedies all in the family mash 
barney miller maude but all enjoyed successful runs and 
also ended with a final episode rather than cancellation 
taflinger expects the only dramacomedy dramedy currently 
airing night court to last until its producers decide to end 
it with a final episode 
taflingers sitcom research began in 1972 and his two years of 
sevenhoursaday viewing spanned 197880 when he was writing his 
dissertation at washington state he continued his research and 
expanded it into his sitcom manuscript he has about 3000 sitcom 
soundtracks recorded on cassette tapes he listens to them while 
driving watching reruns of favorite episodes in his minds eye 
he remains an avid television viewer and said cheers 
night court and the wonder years are shows that can still 
evoke laughs from him but he doesnt see any of the current crop 
of sitcoms with any staying power

the roman catholic church is taking a harder line toward 
cohabiting couples seeking traditional church weddings but is 
making it easier than ever before for catholics to wed people of 
other faiths 
a new handbook on marriage preparationdrawn up by a committee of 
us bishops states priests are taking an increasingly 
confrontational approach toward cohabiting couples who create an 
occasion of scandal for others by weakening the sanctity of 
marriage itself 
you have to face the issue we cant ignore it said bishop 
phillip f straling of san bernardino calif chairman of an 
adhoc committee that drafted the handbook titled faithful to 
each other forever marriage is not just a convenience but a 
sacred gift 
while the document published may 8 strives to take what its 
authors call a countercultural approach toward sexual ethics 
the bishops take an ecumenical approach toward another social trend 
interreligious marriages 
the handbook establishes guidelines encouraging cooperative 
relations with noncatholic clergy involved with the wedding and 
mandating religious freedom for both spouses stating the wedding 
should never be the cause of any conversion 
valerie dillon president of the national association of 
catholic diocesan family life ministers and a consultant to the 
report said interreligious marriages are really serving as 
models of ecumenical growth and they are the wave of the future 
the 400page handbook was drawn up by the bishops committee for 
pastoral research and practices in response to a 1983 vatican 
directive for national episcopal conferences to issue norms for 
priests and others involved in marriage preparation in the 53 
millionmember denomination 
the handbook also was approved by the administrative committee 
of the national conference of catholic bishops 
the denver city council last week abolished a livinginsin 
law as outmoded but with the number of americans living together 
before marriage tripling to 2 million in the period from 197084 
priests have been losing their inhibitions about confronting 
cohabiting catholics with traditional church teaching monsignor 
joseph m champlin the chief author of the marriage handbook said 
in an interview 
twenty to 25 years ago priests generally tended to overlook 
the fact they were living together champlin said its like 
parents sometimes its better not to know what the kids are 
doing 
the new handbook states that while priests remain concerned 
about alienating catholics seeking the sacrament of marriage 
church leaders and clergy have increasingly adopted a more 
challenging confrontational approach to cohabiting couples 
the negative statistics and harmful effects of cohabitation 
certainly contributed to that new development as well as the 
question of scandal to others and the potential injury to the 
sanctity of marriage 
since 1984 the dioceses of st cloud minn and cleveland have 
established policies encouraging cohabiting couples to separate and 
generally allowing only small nuptial masses for couples who 
refuse to live apart 
champlin said such dioceses have decided that to have a big 
ceremony with a great dramatization is like making a mockery of 
marriage itself 
while the handbook emphasizes traditional church teaching 
forbidding premarital sex the decision for handling individual 
couples is left to priests 
we dont condone what they have been doing but we try to 
straighten things out straling said 
mrs dillon said the church needs to confront couples living 
together not to be punitive but to ensure theyre marrying for 
sacramental reasons as opposed to pressure from their families or 
other reasons 
the church says marriage for any reason other than a free 
desire to commit to each other for life is not an acceptable reason 
for marriage within the church she said 
in the area of interreligious marriages the church has moved 
from confrontation to conciliation in the last generation 
theres just been a tremendous growth in the kind of 
collaborative approach said monsignor champlin also the author 
of together for life a book of prayers for the wedding liturgy 
that has been used by twothirds of the couples married by catholic 
priests over the last 20 years 
in his own family he recalled his mother was married to a 
noncatholic in a rectory and his brother was married outside of 
the communion railing today he said catholics are able to get 
married with the churchs blessing at a protestant church even if a 
priest is not present 
with 40 percent of american catholics entering into 
interreligious marriages the bishops state in the marriage 
handbook that the trend is a reality to which we must respond in 
as positive a way as possible 
the handbook encourages the catholic and noncatholic spouse to 
become familiar with the teachings of each others religion and 
mandates that both spouses enjoy total freedom with regard to 
their own beliefs 
an interreligious marriage may be the occasion but must never 
be the cause of any conversion the handbook said 
while samefaith marriages have some advantages straling said 
the bishops wanted to stress in the document interreligious 
marriages can work and do work

marilyn adams sees hidden killers in 
peaceful farm country theyre around the barns the tractors and 
even the golden grain that proved deadly to her youngest child 
swallowing the boy like quicksand 
keith algreen was 11 years old when he died in a farm accident 
his mother aches for him she is also determined her loss be a 
lesson so other families will not face such tragedy or suffer such 
sadness 
mrs adams has formed an organization to preach the gospel of 
farm safety its an allconsuming cause taking her from 
classrooms to capitol hill talking with children homemakers 
lawmakers and anyone else wholl listen 
ive let this become my entire life she said quietly i 
guess this is my replacement for keiths life 
farm safety for just kids is essentially a onewoman 
campaign with a commonsense message beware of everyday dangers 
tractors that roll over and crush pesticides that poison flowing 
grain that can suffocate 
often these things are overlooked because of the 
familiarity mrs adams said a lot of people accept farm 
accidents as way of life 
children are particularly vulnerable she said because they 
work sidebyside with their parents 
we give children an adult responsibility and theyre 
just not old enough to handle it she said an 8yearold or a 
10yearold is not qualified to be a heavy equipment operator but 
yet we have 8 and 10yearold tractor drivers out there there is 
a definite attitude change that needs to come about that has to 
start at home 
tragedy struck at her home in this tiny central iowa town at 
harvest time in 1986 
keith had stayed home from school that october day to help his 
stepfather unload corn he was supposed to turn the tractor power 
off when the corn emptied from a gravity wagon that holds 250 
bushels about three tons of grain the grain falls through a 
funnelshaped chute into an auger that carries it into a bin 
mrs adams isnt sure how it happened but keith fell into the 
wagon and was sucked down into the flowing grain he was found near 
the chute about 20 minutes later by his stepfather who had been 
working in the field 
at the hospital corn and corn chaff were found in keiths 
lungs he was declared brain dead 
i could tell when it was finally over his mother said it 
was 3 oclock in the morning his little body just shook the whole 
time and then he stopped trembling 
keith died of suffocation his eyes heart valves and a kidney 
were donated to five people 
his death devastated a family that was so safety conscious that 
keith wore a lifejacket when he went fishing and frogging in the 
pond on their farm 
mrs adams 38 who has two surviving daughters and three 
stepchildren saw painful reminders everywhere she quit a 
bookkeeping job because the fire departmentrescue squad was 
outside her window she left a bank tellers position because it 
hurt so much when children keiths age came in to make little 
deposits 
after about six months the mothers anguish turned to activism 
she started calling manufacturers gathering information to figure 
out what happened 
mrs adams then decided to design safety decals for gravity 
wagons and with financing from her employer at the time firestone 
tire amp rubber co distributed 50000 of them two companies now 
use her decals on their wagons or augers two others have their own 
mrs adams also began testifying before congressional committees 
and addressing farm groups she now seeks a sponsor to pay for 
educational materials for schools and hopes to have chapters of 
farm safety for just kids set up around the country within six 
months 
mrs adams has memorized the sobering statistics 
the national safety council estimates about 1600 people died 
and 160000 suffered disabling injuries in 1987 in 
agriculturerelated incidents 
as for children a 1987 mayo clinic study said 300 die and 
23500 are injured annually in farmrelated accidents 
the mayo study which reviewed accidents involving 87 farm 
children also found the greatest number of injuries occur at age 3 
and age 13 about twothirds of the accidents surveyed were caused 
by grain augers and tractors 
still the problem didnt receive much attention until mrs 
adams grabbed on to the issue like a bulldog said kelley 
donham a university of iowa professor and chairman of the national 
coalition for agricultural safety and health 
he said mrs adams provides a special perspective as a victims 
mother 
her experience has put a lightning rod on the whole 
issue he said 
her friend fredi juri president of the iowa organization of 
women for agriculture agrees when mrs adams talks all of a 
sudden the statistics have a name and a face she said 
its very easy to sit back and say i cant make a 
difference she added she has the gumption to at least try 
it isnt always easy 
mrs adams a slender bespectacled woman still grieves for the 
little boy with the earnest grin who wanted to become a minister 
keiths drawings of spaceships and helicopters are in a brass 
chest the calf he fed and tended was never sent to market his red 
bicycle gathers cobwebs in the barn ten ounces of fools gold 
he found are stored in a pouch except one nugget his mother wears 
around her neck 
birthdays and family dinners thats when i miss him the 
most mrs adams said i still have a lot of tearful nights 
church and community activities are trying too youre 
watching all of his friends grow up and its just difficult because 
thats when i have to address the real side of it when you go to 
these things and hes not there as long as i address the business 
side of it and can save lives my emotions are pretty much ok 
keith would have been 14 last month mrs adams visited his 
grave on his birthday one side of his tombstone has an etching of 
a treehouse like the one he built at his grandmas house months 
before he died the other side has a drawing of a pot of gold with 
nuggets dropping in and the words our little prospector 
he probably is guiding this whole thing somehow mrs adams 
said her voice quavering he would be very proud

frances sandovals enemy is mean and tough and 
lives in a world where life is cheap and death is common she 
already knows this foe can kill her son was a victim 
gang violence killed arthur sandoval he was 15 his mother 
mourned then rose to face the gangs and say enough is enough 
she formed mothers against gangs a call to action for those 
like her whove seen so many young lives destroyed so much blood 
shed and so many dreams snuffed out 
gangs represent death pain and suffering said the 
35yearold ms sandoval this is not one familys problem its 
all the families in the community only together can we send 
the message were not going to accept you or tolerate you its 
reinforcing the fact we have some control over the destiny of our 
children 
mothers against gangs monitors court cases lobbies 
lawmakers accompanies victims families to trials and leads 
campaigns to clean up the graffiti gangs use to mark their 
territory 
arthur died in january 1985 he and a buddy had gone to look for 
the friends sister and found her talking to five gang members 
a fight broke out and as arthur and his friend were leaving a 
sixth gang member appeared he stuck a knife into arthurs heart 
pulled it out and stabbed him again 
ms sandoval later tracked down the woman who had cradled her 
dying son she told me she held my son and covered him with a 
coat she said all he said was he was cold 
three gang members identified arthurs killer ms sandoval 
said but he had no job or family to keep him in the area and 
police werent optimistic about capturing him 
so a determined ms sandoval appealed for help on english and 
spanishspeaking television and radio she offered a 1000 reward 
in less than two weeks an anonymous caller phoned police and 
the man was picked up 
the familys pain had just begun that year ms sandovals 
younger son vincent failed in school her daughter lydia 
attempted suicide with an overdose of epilepsy medication 
all she knew was her brother was dead and the person who 
killed him was alive ms sandoval said she completely 
disassociated herself from the legal system 
in the fall of 1985 the accused who said he mistook arthurs 
fatigue jacket for one from a rival gang was convicted of murder 
before the judge imposed a 35yearsentence ms sandoval turned to 
arthurs killer juan lopez rojo 
i said you did not know my son and my son did not know you 
animals kill for survival but you killed for the sake of killing 
you pursued him to kill him you should receive the same sentence 
as you gave to arthur 
this was a future that was murdered not just a person she 
now says her eyes welling with tears arthur was an honors student 
who dreamed of becoming a marine she said 
publicity about ms sandovals plight prompted other victims 
mothers to call most of them seeking help or just a sympathetic 
ear 
one woman whose son was killed she recalled told her she could 
not face the murderer alone ms sandoval went to court and saw the 
mother sitting alone with her two daughters while the other side 
was crowded with friends and family of the two accused i began 
to feel there definitely is something wrong she said 
in the spring of 1986 ms sandoval and a few other mothers 
formed the group initially it was for victims families then ms 
sandoval started hearing from gang members mothers 
one she said called and said my son is one of them she 
was crying please help me do you know what its like to go to 
the railroad tracks and pick up your son half beaten to death i 
know hes going to die im just waiting for the call or the 
knock on the door 
these mothers are now part of the organization which claims 
more than 700 members in three illinois chapters plans have been 
made to expand outside the state and spinoffs already have formed 
funding comes from private donations 
mothers seeks to organize neighborhoods wracked by gang 
violence its necessary they realize they have some control 
she said the communities have to stop passively accepting that 
this is the way it is 
cleaning up gang symbols for example she said gives them 
the sense they dont have to sit back and fold their hands 
police estimate about 125 gangs with 12000 members operate in 
chicago 
those who know ms sandoval a petite bluntspoken woman whos 
an administrative assistant to an alderman think she can make a 
difference 
what she offers people is a sign of hope and courage said 
timothy mccormick an expriest who once worked with ms sandoval 
she speaks out a lot of times when a lot of people wont 
gangs live off others fears and she challenges them many times 
people want to hide in the shadows frances calls you to stand out 
in the light 
she has that extra credibility and that urgency said the 
rev larry craig who counseled ms sandoval and whose church is 
across the street from where arthur was stabbed 
no one can deny a bunch of mothers whove had their sons 
or their daughters killed he said you cant make them wait in 
the lobby you cant push them away 
ms sandoval whose story will be told in a tv movie said 
arthurs death has changed her 
before my son was murdered i never hated anybody in my life 
she said now i hate lopez rojo for making him hate me that is 
an emotion no one should have to feel an emotion i have no control 
over 
but she also said she understands he wanted to belong he 
too was a victim of gangs 
now sometimes when she sees a smiling young man she thinks of 
arthur and she said when im overwhelmed and surrounded with 
so much pain from other mothers i say arthur pray for me 
arthur lifted her spirits when times got tough 
he would always tell me you can do it you can make it he had 
a lot of faith in everybody 
if he could see her now she said he would probably say 
mommy youve come a long way you are one gutsy lady

mary gall had a letter of recommendation from 
george bush the fbis stamp of approval to work as a white house 
adviser and 20 years experience volunteering with specialneeds 
kids 
but when gall applied to adopt a handicapped child six years 
ago 20 us adoption agencies turned her down simply because she 
was single 
tenacity she soon discovered is a requirement for anyone 
joining the growing ranks of single women who want to adopt her 
persistence paid off she eventually adopted two children from 
guatemala 
im thrilled those 20 agencies said no to me because i got 
the most wonderful kids said gall 39 now assistant secretary 
of human development services in the federal department of health 
and human services when you have beautiful children who love you 
dearly its like sitting in the sun all the time 
while there were few single adoptive parents 10 years ago 
experts estimate they comprise 10 percent of those adopting today 
local chapters of the national committee for single adoptive 
parents based in maryland are proliferating 
ninety percent of singles who adopt are women those familiar 
with the type say it takes a special kind of woman to spend 
thousands of dollars in adoption fees sacrifice her social life 
and put up with one rejection after another in the search for a 
child to call her own 
these are women who have a strong maternal instinct who want 
to be called mommy for whom marriage is not immediately in the 
cards and they are facing the proverbial biological clock said 
jeffrey rosenberg of the national committee for adoption 
generally theyre between 35 and 45 professional women who 
have established themselves theyre pretty comfortable with what 
they want out of life and are pretty stubborn to make this whole 
decision said lea wait 45 of bernardsville nj an atampt 
manager who adopted four children and runs a support group for 
singles who adopt 
or as lindsay gambini put it i knew i wanted to be a mother 
i wasnt sure i wanted to be a wife 
gambini 39 manager of a manhattan performing arts center 
adopted two children but not without a struggle first an adoption 
in the philippines fell through she turned to the new york city 
fostercare system but was turned down because she planned to hire 
a babysitter during working hours she was offered older children 
but thanks to a shortage of foster homes for infants and her own 
persistence she prevailed and got two baby boys now 28 months and 
15 months old 
both boys were abandoned by their birth mothers victims of 
grinding poverty and the drug epidemic that has nearly doubled the 
citys foster care load since 1986 
the elder one is a bit developmentally delayed and the younger 
one had some drugs in his system she said adding a mothers 
proud ps theyre cute as buttons 
like other single women who adopt boys gambini says male 
friends and relatives are happy to fill in as role models 
otherwise they improvise as mary gall did when her sons soccer 
team needed a coach she bought a book about the game and committed 
it to memory 
does adopting children dash all hopes of matrimony for the 
single woman joy duva 41 who works in washington dc for the 
child welfare league echoed most single moms when she said that if 
she ever does find the right man that person would love me and 
the baby 
duva recently adopted a girl from paraguay forced as was gall 
to adopt overseas because domestic agencies favor couples much of 
the difficulty single women face here stems from the fact that many 
of them want healthy babies and theres a lot of competition from 
infertile couples a lot of agencies as gall discovered are even 
reluctant to place older specialneeds children with singles 
traditionally the thinking was that families with a husband 
and a wife were the best place for a child to be particularly for 
kids who never had that said phil coltoff who heads the 
childrens aid society in new york city 
but he noted theres been a rethinking of what single women 
can offer an independent career woman is a powerful role model 
for any child he said adding that at least 10 percent of the 
childrens aid societys foster mothers are single 
some agencies say certain children with special needs are 
actually better off with single parents 
if a kid has been in a group home and has learned to not 
attach to people it might be easier for him to bond with one 
person than two said bob diamond head of aid to adoption of 
special kids in oakland calif which makes 15 percent to 20 
percent of its placements with single parents 
betsy burch who runs a national information and referral 
organization called space for single parents for the adoption of 
children everywhere from her home in natick mass says single 
parents today can even adopt young healthy american children as 
long as they are open to interracial adoption 
i was teaching in boston burch recalled i had my 
masters degree in urban education and found out there were many 
black kids who needed placement i decided to go ahead and do it 
burch who is white has adopted four black children 
coltoff of the childrens aid society also stressed the need for 
flexibility in interracial adoptions 
at any one time we have close to 500 kids in foster care if 
we have one or two white kids its accidental he said most 
of the children in agencies like ours are black and hispanic or 
interracial 
would legislation make it any easier for single adoptive 
parents gall thinks not 
you cant change public opinions through law she said if 
you want to reach people and say single parent homes are good 
homes its a matter of educating them to realize that families 
dont all look alike

a japanese editorial writer says some of his 
countrys farmers complain too much while others are more energetic 
and have a positive attitude about their way of life 
yasuhiko kishi of the nihon keizai shimbum newspaper says 
farmers meetings are usually preceded with a comment that the 
operating environment surrounding the agricultural sector is 
difficult or severe 
in other words japanese farmers apparently agree with many 
others in the world its too dry or too wet prices too low 
expenses too high not to mention the government politicians 
television radio newspapers and assorted columnists 
now while this is certainly true the situation is not going 
to change by moaning about how bad things are kishi wrote it 
must seem to those outside agriculture that farmers wallow in the 
word difficult 
but kishi is not exactly a latterday hl mencken the acerbic 
baltimore writer who more than 60 years ago characterized the 
american farmer as grasping selfish and dishonest 
when the going is good for him he robs the rest of us up to 
the extreme limit of our endurance mencken wrote when the 
going is bad he comes bawling for help out of the public till 
kishi offers some suggestions for japanese farmers beginning 
with a proposal to eliminate the word difficult from their 
vocabulary 
perhaps it is best if those farmers who truly believe that 
their future is bleak and that nothing can be done about it should 
pack up and quit farming kishi said i would like to see land 
that is no longer used leased to those who would really like to 
farm it 
kishi told of one farmer a mr u who has used his regions 
supposedly poor mountainous conditions to his best advantage by 
leasing land at various altitudes and then rotating his vegetable 
crops to exploit the different climates and weather that 
prevail at the different levels 
it is precisely this kind of bold response to adversity that 
is required of farmers today he said 
turning to another problem kishi said the biggest mistake in 
japans basic agricultural law may possibly be its attempt to try 
to foster independent management of farms he said 
farmers who are serious about farming do not want to be 
fostered kishi said those who do are not worth being fostered 
in the first place the role of an agricultural administration is 
to create an environment in which enthusiastic and capable farmers 
can perform to their fullest 
kishi said more diversification is needed in japanese 
agriculture no longer should there be one village one specialty 
product in japan 
this is an age when diversification is required of both 
agricultural products and the farmers that grow them he said 
to meet consumers changing tastes supplies and suppliers must 
also diversify take vegetables as an example some customers feel 
that vegetables are not fresh unless they still have the soil on 
them others are so busy that they want their produce readycut 
agriculture must respond according to consumers needs 
in kishis view one of the disadvantages of japans food system 
is that it has created large numbers of farmers who are unaware the 
difficulties of marketing 
all that farmers have to do is take their rice to the 
agricultural cooperatives he said after that they dont have 
to do a thing the rice is sold to the government for them at a set 
price and the money is deposited into their accounts 
kishi said its only natural therefore that farmers quickly 
forget about the concept of selling commodities he said mr u 
belives that management translates into sales 
why is it that ideas that sound like common sense in other 
industries sound so radically new in the agricultural sector i 
would also like to add at the risk of being misunderstood that it 
is a virtue for farmers to be shrewd and money conscious he said 
another problem involves the entry of young people into farming 
kishi said that in most of japan there is a lament that farm 
households have no one to take over no youthful succesors 
this is an age when those few that do choose farming do so 
because they truly want to kishi said isnt it the case that 
what has been lacking in japans agriculture is precisely the pride 
that is shown by those who choose farming of their own accord 
kishis remarks were reprinted in the may issue of japan agrinfo 
newsletter which is published by the japan international 
agricultural council tokyo

on the untouched expanse of the arctic icecap it seemed a mirage 
preposterous incredible ski tracks 
will steger leading the first unsupported dogsled trek to the 
north pole since adm robert pearys saw the unmistakable evidence 
of crosscountry skis he knew they could only be those of 
jeanlouis etienne a frenchman who was about to become the first 
man to ski alone to the pole 
it was in april 1986 in a tent on the monotonous frozen 
landscape that the two adventurers sipped tea and dreamed of their 
next quest a multinational trek across antarctica after reaching 
their destination they began planning the transantarctica 
expedition which is to begin aug 1 
their previous exploits were for the sheer joy of pitting man 
against nature this one would do that and more draw attention to 
threats against nature and to the need for international 
cooperation in protecting antarctica 
steger and etienne enlisted scientists and explorers from the 
soviet union china japan and great britain for a sevenmonth 
4000mile trip others have crossed antarctica on snowmobiles and 
giant snow tractors but this will be the first unmechanized 
attempt 
victor boyarsky of the soviet arctic and antarctic research 
institute a popular explorer and veteran of polar travel is a 
coleader the other members of the team are glaciologist qin dahe 
of china geoff somers who has spent 42 months in antarctica with 
the british antarctic survey and keizo funatsu of japan a former 
economist who turned to dogsledding and adventure 
somers will plot the treks course funatsu is in charge of the 
dogs 
steger who in the past has picked his own teams says he is 
honored that the soviet union and china will be sending official 
representatives the four members from western nations are not 
formally backed by their governments 
steger recalled that when he asked if boyarsky spoke english a 
soviet official replied in one year he will speak english very 
well 
a real interesting diplomatic challenge steger called it 
other international support includes the use of chinas great 
wall station on king george island as a staging point new 
zealanders stationed at the scott mcardle base donated 12 dogs 
whose lineage can be traced to dogs owned by polar explorer richard 
byrd the soviet union provided an icebreaker to transport 15 tons 
of food for the men and 36 dogs the provisions were cached on the 
route in november the ussr also plans to send a military cargo 
plane to pick up the team from its rendezvous at stegers minnesota 
camp the us state department while not officially sanctioning 
the trek is expected to let the plane land 
after refueling in cuba the team will fly to the great wall 
base about 600 miles south of the tip of south america the 
expedition which will set out in the middle of the austral winter 
will at first follow known landmarks 
well have maps for the first 1500 miles the last 2500 
miles there is virtually nothing its flat theres nothing to 
map steger said 
theyll cross the ellsworth mountains and skirt mt vinson the 
continents highest spot at 16860 feet theyll visit three 
american bases palmer siple and amundsenscott at the south 
pole where they plan to celebrate christmas 
the next dot of civilization theyll aim for is the soviet base 
at vostok near the magnetic south pole vostok the coldest place 
on earth will serve as a base for a french documentary film crew 
that will travel with the expedition for three weeks and for the 
teams pilot 
by march the trekkers should reach the soviet base of mirnyy on 
the east coast also known as queen mary coast ending the longest 
possible traverse 
theyll be picked up by the expedition ship built in france 
with a special aluminum hull designed to pop up and settle intact 
on top of the ice rather than be trapped and crushed 
so far about 45 nations have signed television contracts with 
the expedition abc has bought exclusive us tv rights we want 
the world to know much much more about antarctica after our 
expedition than it did before we set out steger said 
the continent is roughly the shape of a bottle cap it rises 
sharply at the perimeter then flattens out in a vast high plateau 
at an average elevation of 9500 feet antarcticas 54 million 
square miles is more than china and india combined it has no 
indigenous people and wildlife is confined to the coast 
a treaty signed in 1959 by a dozen nations with additional 
signatories in subsequent years put all territorial claims on 
antarctica on hold banned military activity and established 
freedom of scientific inquiry 
but many countries now have designs on the land for strategic 
political and even economic reasons some expect to find oil coal 
and mineral deposits under the ice some want to see the continent 
cut into pieshaped wedges but steger wants the people of the 
world to demand that it be protected intact 
it sounds like a very lofty goal but antarctica is a going to 
play a very important role in the future of the planet he said 
planetary warming of just a few degrees could melt the polar ice 
caps raising sea level and flooding coastal areas but steger said 
its simplistic to worry about submerged cities with 85 percent of 
the planets fresh water stored in the snow and ice of antarctica 
a thaw would reduce the salinity of the oceans change ocean 
currents and wreak havoc with weather patterns 
the other environmental nightmare awakening interest in 
antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer 
directly over the continent ozone screens the planet from excess 
ultraviolet radiation 
scientists predict continued ozone depletion will increase skin 
cancer but such thinking is myopic steger said most 
significantly increased solar radiation could disrupt the 
reproduction cycles of plankton the microscopic oceanic plants and 
animals that are the basis of the global food chain 
these ominous changes are most apparent in antarctica making it 
like a canary in a mine steger said 
the team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500 
miles as they cross a 13000foot high plateau known as the area of 
inaccessibility its the worst possible place on earth for 
ultraviolet exposure 
the team will carry a monitor and boyarsky will record ozone 
levels at regular intervals the first crosssection of ozone 
across the continent 
qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across 
antarctica recording temperatures and oxygen content for a 
geological history of the icecap 
etienne a physician will monitor cholesterol levels of the 
team members who will rely on the highfat diet typical of 
cultures in cold regions 
but the experiments that can be done along the way are limited 
by time and weight the trekkers plan to travel 30 miles a day on 
crosscountry skis and the three dogsleds can carry no more than 
900 pounds of gear 
steger admits they wont attempt pure science but he hopes 
the findings will contribute to the knowledge of this frontier 
we need international cooperation solutions to environmental 
problems must be global

the only piece of the planet that has never been divided or 
conquered is antarctica a vast wilderness kept neutral by a unique 
treaty 
it has no boundaries other than its own ragged coastline 
the antarctic treaty grew out of the 195758 international 
geophysical year as an agreement to demilitarize denuclearize 
and basically depoliticize the continent said ray arnaudo of the 
state department office of oceans and polar affairs 
of the 12 original signers seven nations had territorial claims 
on parts of antarctica the treaty solved that problem by putting 
the claims on ice so to speak arnaudo said its an agreement 
to disagree 
the treaty which came into force in 1961 reserves antarctica 
for peaceful purposes and guarantees freedom of research below 
latitude 60 degrees south it was written so that it could not be 
changed for 30 years and thereafter remains in force unless a 
signer calls for a conference to review a particular item 
the earliest a signer could call for renegotiation is 1991 but 
so far no nation was indicated a desire to do so arnaudo said 
we are quite happy with the treaty its not perfect but it 
works 
cynics could say its successful because theres nothing to 
fight about but ice but i think anyplace where there is 
interaction between countries and the action is peaceful it 
deserves note 
there have been no military exercises no nuclear weapons and no 
conventional weapons on antarctica for 30 years the treaty also 
prohibits nations from using the continent as a dump for 
radioactive wastes 
the original signers the united states soviet union japan 
south africa belgium argentina australia chile france new 
zealand norway and great britain the last six with territorial 
claims have been joined by 27 other nations the 39 nations 
represent twothirds of the world population 
to deal with new issues the treaty also calls for meetings 
every other year participants include the dozen original signers 
and 10 other signatory nations that conduct substantial scientific 
research in antarctica the other 17 nations attend as observers 
during the falklands war the british and the argentines sat at 
the same table and agreed not to talk about the maldive islands 
similarly both north and south korea are signers arnaudo said 
at the 14 meetings since 1961 a number of measures have been 
adopted to facilitate scientific research and protect the antarctic 
environment 
talks are under way regarding mineral resources all parties to 
the treaty have agreed to refrain from mining until an agreement is 
reached 
its a remarkable place arnaudo said its a place where 
people really do cooperate

here are some facts about antarctica the coldest place on 
earth 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
antarctica is so remote that the great explorers missed it 
altogether during the age of discovery neither the russian 
thaddeus von bellinhausen who discovered two coastal islands in 
181920 nor american nathaniel palmer who discovered what is now 
called palmer peninsula in 1820 realized they were on the verge of 
a new continent in 1840 american charles wilkes sailed along 
1500 miles of coast and realized that he had found the seventh 
continent 
in 1911 norwegian roald amundsen was the first to reach the 
south pole eighteen years later aviator richard byrd was the 
first fly over it british scientists led by sir vivian ernest 
fuchs made the first land traverse of the continent in 195758 in 
huge snow tractors 
six thousand meteorites have been discovered on antarctica 
more than those discovered in all the rest of the world 
the continents human population averages 2000 in the summer 
dwindling to about 800 in the winter only one other warmblooded 
animal remains during the winter the emperor penguin the female 
emperor penguin lays one egg and returns to the warm sea for the 
winter the male fined space schneiderman said not only is the office 
or 
house a pain in the neck but the outdoors is beckoning 
hormones also play a role he said the increase in sunlight 
triggers the pineal gland at the base of the brain to release 
hormones similar hormones in other animals and birds signal the 
onset of mating season the increased hours of sunlight also 
stimulate migration in birds 
in a sense schneiderman said people have an urge to fly from 
their responsibilities i think most people can deal with it 
most people wont come to the doctor for it if they wound up 
coming to the doctor for it i would think they had some other 
problem 
staying indoors for some time also has been known to cause 
physical problems headaches cronic fatigue and irritability have 
been linked to lower oxygen levels and indoor pollutants like molds 
and formaldehyde odors 
the cure to spring fever is to enjoy life to stop and smell the 
blooming roses schneiderman said getting out is good for 
physical health and getting out is good for mental health 
running to and from the car doesnt count as getting outside 
of course he warned everyone must be sure to fulfill their 
obligations and lane said spring may even be the time for an 
increase in labor 
spring is the time for an increase in labor a time for 
planning a time to spend seed he said adding that spring also 
can be a reawakening 
climb to the top of a large hill or a mountain with a good 
view and think about the meaning of life

a 65yearold stockbroker had his coronary 
arteries unblocked on a wednesday and was playing golf three days 
later after doctors used a cool laser to vaporize fatty deposits 
keeping blood from his heart 
albert berkow is one of three patients who have had plaque 
removed with the excimer laser at philadelphia heart institute 
one of three hospitals performing clinical trials for the us food 
and drug administration 
the laser zaps the plaque said institute director dr 
bernard l segal the procedure is done through a catheter without 
open heart surgery 
i felt only the anesthetic needle said berkow who 
underwent the experimental treatment wednesday april 26 and 
played golf that weekend 
the first phase of the clinical trial will establish the safety 
and effectiveness of the procedure to permanantly open arteries in 
the heart that are clogged by accumulate fatty deposits south 
miami hospital and cedarssinai of los angeles where the procedure 
was invented also are testing the laser 
an excimer laser was first used to clear coronary arteries in 
1987 at the university of ottawa heart institute but that involved 
open heart surgery 
the laser transmits energy in pulses that last a billionth of a 
second much too fast for the body to feel heat said dr michael 
s feldman director of cardiology here unlike other lasers which 
cut or seal with heat the cool laser vaporizes plaque without 
damaging the arteries or leaving debris that could cause clotting 
or a heart attack 
the excimer laser is more controlled than the hot laser because 
the energy is released in pulses and not a steady flow said 
cardiologist george abela of the university of florida school of 
medicine in gainesville who helped pioneer lasers in blocked 
arteries 10 years ago cardiologists will welcome the excimer laser 
as a method of treating clogged coronary arteries he said 
dr timothy sanborn of mount sinais school of medicine said 
researchers there will soon begin treatment with a similar laser 
that will involve balloon angioplasty in which a tiny inflated 
balloon is used to force open the blood vessels i think youre 
going to see the cool laser as adding to the cardiologists box 
of tools sanborn said 
for the 2hour procedure a flexible catheter containing a 
bundle of thin glass fibers is inserted into a blood vessel in the 
groin and up the descending aorta until it reaches a blockage in 
the heart once positioned a laser beam vaporizes plaque and opens 
the artery if needed balloon angioplasty can be used as a 
followup procedure 
excimer laser angioplasty has the potential for becoming a 
safer faster less traumatic and less expensive alternative to 
open heart bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty which are now 
used on about 200000 patients a year feldman said 
if the fda approves the laser for general use segal said the 
treatment will cost about 1500 about the same as balloon 
angioplasty researchers hope the excimer laser procedure will 
overcome the reccurrence of blockage which happens in about 30 
percent of patients treated with balloon angioplasty 
the researchers began their study by first using cool laser 
techniques to remove plaque from the larger arteries in the leg 
the excimer laser was designed by james laudenslager a chemical 
physicist at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif for 
nasa to measure ozone in the atmosphere doctors at cedarssinai 
began testing it on blocked arteries in september 1988 and have 
been successful in about 75 percent of the 20 patients treated 
saod dr juan grundfest of cedarssinai 
its a major revolution grundfest said not only in the 
treatment of blocked arteries but in the fiber optics technology 
like any new device its not 100 percent successful he 
cautioned researchers are working on smaller catheters to reach 
the smaller arteries and to improve the lasers ability to vaporize 
larger deposits in the vessels he expects the fda to consider the 
procedure for general use in late 1990 
the philadelphia institute part of presbyterian medical center 
will test the procedure on about 50 patients in the next four 
months 
among other new methods being used to cut through clogged 
arteries are a shaver catheter which works like a razor a 
rotablator similar to a dentists drill and hottipped lasers in 
which the metal point is heated by the laser to burn away the fatty 
deposits

a new slowacting pesticide 
approved for indoor use against cockroaches and ants also may stop 
the formasan super termite that is spreading throughout the 
south a researcher says 
the formosan termite is so aggressive that its pushing out 
our native subterranean termites said entomologist nanyao su 
with the university of florida institute of food and agricultural 
sciences if we dont stop this pest its possible the formosan 
termite could eventually replace our native species in the southern 
part of the united states 
the pest has been found in florida alabama louisiana 
mississippi south carolina tennessee and texas one colony may 
contain 7 million termites and weigh 60 pounds su said you 
could say one of these termite colonies is like a 60pound animal 
eating about three pounds of wood every day 
when you consider how aggressively this pest searches for 
wood cardboard and paper its easy to see why its so 
destructive 
with the beginning of swarming season as many as 68000 winged 
termites may emerge from one nest at night in search of places 
where they can mate and begin new colonies flights range as far as 
1500 feet from the nest 
worse yet su said the pests are attracted by lights 
especially fluorescent lights warm moist cracks or crevices in 
buildings are ideal entry points and the formosan termite can 
infest buildings from the top floor downward without the ground 
connection needed by domestic termites 
the key to controlling the pest is to destroy the underground 
colonies he said large quantities of pesticide beneath buildings 
may keep the pest out but wont destroy nests that could be as far 
as 600 feet away 
termites are very sensitive to chemicals and seal off their 
colonies to avoid them the new chemical sulfluramid is effective 
at concentrations so low termites dont detect it su said a few 
grams of the compound produced by griffin corp of valdosta ga 
should be enough to destroy an entire colony 
field tests are set for this summer he said

fx 33 may sound like a new jet fighter 
but its use is strictly on the ground its a type of grass that 
needs so little water that a plot last sprinkled in january is 
still lush and green 
it offers a significant advantage in drought resistance 
said phil busey a university of florida researcher but were 
still not sure how it will do with very cold weather shade and 
some types of disease 
fx 33 looks much like floratam developed by the university 14 
years ago busey said weve had both of them in fort lauderdale 
test plots for 14 months now without irrigation and the floratam 
has all but died out 
its not that fx 33 doesnt need water its the ability to use 
water efficiently that counts fx 33 has roots extending up to five 
feet into the soil enough to tap into the shallow aquifer beneath 
much of central florida 
spring droughts have forced bans on water usage during most of 
the daylight hours in central and southern florida 
however busey suspects fx 33 has no tolerance for temperatures 
much below 20 degrees and might be susceptible to a disease called 
gray leaf spot its also still unclear how the grass does in 
prolonged shade 
homeowners need not line up at the garden store just yet since 
more tests will preclude commercial production until perhaps the 
summer of 1991

takeover speculators are betting that wpp group 
plcs new 50ashare purchase offer for ogilvy group inc will not 
be enough to capture the american advertising company 
the wpp offer puts a value of roughly 750 million on ogilvy 
the worlds fifthlargest advertising concern based on 1988 
billings wpp owner of the us agency j walter thompson ranks 
third 
together the companies would roughly tie britains saatchi amp 
saatchi for honors as the worlds biggest advertising group 
wpp said monday it was stepping up from its initial offer of 45 
a share in order to avoid unnecessary and potentially unsettling 
delay in the negotiation of a friendly transaction 
arbitragers bid ogilvys stock up 212 a share in 
overthecounter trading on monday to 52 a share higher than the 
offer made public by britains wpp 
the speculators apparently believed wpp would raise its offer 
again or that a debtfinanced group possibly led by management 
would buy the company from shareholders at more than 50 a share 
analysts said 
it is less likely that another advertising company will emerge 
as a bidder because the price already is more than 50 percent 
above what the market considered ogilvy worth before the bidding 
began said james d dougherty an analyst at county natwest usa 
ogilvy traded as low as 24 a share late last year it rose to 
the low 30s partly on takeover speculation before the initial 
wpp offer which was confirmed may 1 
i frankly have a lot of problem finding economic sense at this 
price at 45 maybe dougherty said 
ogilvy says it can serve its clients better by remaining 
independent 
a spokeswoman joelle frank said monday ogilvy had received 
many other expressions of interest but would not say if it had 
negotiated with anyone 
she also declined to confirm a report in the sunday times of 
london that two american investment firms kohlberg kravis roberts 
amp co and wesray capital corp had approached ogilvy with offers 
higher than wpps initial bid 
a spokesman for kohlberg declined to comment on the report 
while a spokesman for wesray did not immediately return a phone 
call 
although wpp wants a friendly deal the londonbased company has 
not ruled out taking its offer directly to ogilvy shareholders with 
a hostile tender offer or proxy fight 
a hostile takeover would not necessarily cripple ogilvy by 
prompting mass defections as has happened in certain other 
takeovers dougherty said 
my suspicion is that there would be a few defections at the 
very top but the worker bees who actually would get the work out 
for the clients would stay he said 
in addition to j walter thompson wpp owns the hill amp knowlton 
public relations agency other ogilvys properties include ogilvy amp 
mather worldwide advertising and scali mccable sloves advertising 
based on ogilvys 147 million shares outstanding a 50ashare 
buyout would total 735 million another 13 million shares could 
be issued through the exercise of stock options but those would 
cost less than 50 apiece for an acquirer because the owner would 
have to put up the exercise price 
ogilvy also has about 40 million in longterm debt that a buyer 
would have to assume

two central figures in criminal and civil 
investigations of new yorks commodity markets paid 135000 in 
1985 to settle charges of collaborating in illegal trades 
officials said 
meanwhile federal officials declined to comment monday on 
published reports that criminal subpoenas had been issued to 
traders in connection with a raid last week on the markets 
the investigations are said to focus on preston h semel who 
runs a brokerage trading in gold silver and other commodities and 
mark b fisher an independent trader who runs an oil futures trade 
processing firm 
federal agents last thursday executed criminal search warrants 
at fishers exchange offices while officials from the commodity 
futures trading commission subpoenaed four exchanges and about 26 
individual traders for information 
the investigations reportedly focus on allegations of a variety 
of trading practices violations including prearranged trades 
using advanced knowledge of customer trades to trade for personal 
accounts and conducting trades in order to skirt tax obligations 
fisher and semel were linked in a 1985 settlement of charges 
brought by the commodity exchange or comex of alleged trading 
abuses committed in 1983 comex spokesman robert mcgrath said 
the two were charged with scheming along with a third trader to 
conduct prearranged trading and improper dual trading in which 
trades are made for both customer and personal accounts 
without admitting or denying guilt fisher paid the exchange a 
60000 fine semel paid 75000 and was suspended two months and 
sergio cardello a partner of semels paid 125000 and lost his 
comex membership seat according to exchange records 
a market source said monday that semel 39 currently is the 
subject of an internal comex investigation for irregular trading 
that involves other individuals 
semel in 1985 also paid a 5000 civil penalty to settle charges 
of conducting socalled wash sales in which contracts are 
bought in identical amounts to create bogus losses for tax purposes 
or to affect the price of a commodity a cftc spokeswoman said 
that violation was included in charges against several other 
firms and traders and involved gold and silver futures on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
a person answering the phone at semel amp co said neither semel 
nor his attorney would be available for comment 
an attorney for fisher said the trader had not received a 
criminal subpoena or been notified by the government that he is a 
target us postal service inspectors executing criminal search 
warrants seized documents from fishers world trade center offices 
thursday 
fisher has received a civil subpoena as part of the cftc probe 
sources said 
a subpoena is a formal request for information it does not 
carry any charge or imply guilt 
fisher and two other traders who have been subpoenaed in the 
civil case attended the university of pennsylvania in the early 
1980s and were known to be personally acquainted 
mark b dickstein a 1980 penn graduate who has his own trading 
firm issued a statement monday that he had received a cftc 
subpoena seeking documents dealing with two months of transactions 
but was not under investigation and neither i nor my counsel 
believe that i am a target of any cftc investigation 
a spokesman for dickstein said the trader had not received a 
criminal subpoena 
craig w effron a 1981 penn graduate and gold trader who also 
has received a civil subpoena declined to comment monday 
dickstein and effron both have been disciplined by comex in the 
past dickstein paid 40000 to settle charges of a variety of 
trading abuses in november 1986 effron paid 7000 in september 
1986 and 9000 in august 1988 to settle trading misconduct charges 
in addition to comex subpoenaed exchanges were the new york 
mercantile exchange the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange and the 
cotton exchange 
a separate justice department investigation of chicagos 
commodities markets the nations largest came to light in january 
but is not connected to the new york probe

the government said tuesday it would grant south 
africancontrolled minorco sa a limited extension in its hostile 
58 billion bid for consolidated gold fields plc 
the panel on takeovers and mergers also ordered gold fields to 
discontinue its court proceedings against minorco unless its 
shareholders approve such actions at a may 30 meeting 
the acquisition of the british gold mining group would be 
britains largest takeover ever 
the takeover panel said it favored extending the timetable for 
the bid because of ongoing litigation in the united states 
under the panels ruling the 2530ashare offer is to expire 
june 7 it would have technically expired april 26 
minorco which already held a 299 percent stake in gold fields 
announced april 26 that enough shareholders had accepted its offer 
to give it a stake of nearly 55 percent in gold fields but us 
litigation arising from antitrust claims has prevented minorco from 
actually taking its stake in gold fields above 30 percent 
usbased newmont mining corp is 49 percent owned by gold 
fields and is a party to the litigation against minorco 
graham williams a spokesman for gold fields said the company 
had no immediate comment on the panels ruling tuesday 
luxembourgbased minorco is 60 percent controlled by anglo 
american corp and de beers consolidated mines ltd the gold and 
diamond mining interests of the south african oppenheimer family 
minorcos bid was unveiled in september and twice sweetened it 
currently includes half a minorco share and 1962 in cash for each

varity corp which has tried to buy fruehauf 
corp three times since last fall finally succeeded with an offer 
worth an estimated 650 million in cash stock and notes 
fruehauf and torontobased varity said monday they signed an 
agreement under which varity will pay 66 million in cash and 430 
million in notes and issue new stock for the kelseyhayes 
automotive products division of fruehauf 
kelseyhayes supplies wheels and antilock brakes and is the 
last of fruehaufs 75yearold corporate empire fruehauf put 
itself up for sale last autumn and has since sold off its 
tractortrailer and marine operations 
varity formerly masseyferguson has pursued the profitable 
kelseyhayes unit for the last eight months if the sale goes 
through fruehauf said it would liquidate its assets although the 
nameplate will continue to appear on its trailers 
under terms of the deal each share of fruehauf common stock 
would be converted into one share of newly issued varity stock at 
mondays prices the new stock would be worth about 145 million 
the 6700 kelseyhayes workers worldwide would not be affected 
immediately varity spokesman jack nowling said he said varity 
will delay any moves until the sale is completed in four or five 
months pending approval of fruehauf shareholders and bondholders 
wilbur ross a spokesman for the creditors said even though 
creditors will be paid only 89 cents for each dollar the deal is 
good because fruehaufs shaky status had meant the debt was worth 
only 70 cents per dollar on the open market 
financial problems at fruehauf builder of half of all trailers 
on the highways in the 1950s date to the 1970s when deregulation 
forced truckers to slash their rates 
the companys financial difficulties were compounded in 1986 
when its managers borrowed 15 billion to buy the company and fend 
off a takeover despite costcutting measures it never recovered 
from the debt burden and began putting divisions up for sale 
in march fruehauf sold its unprofitable truck division for 232 
million to terex corp based in green bay wis

editors note like diapers razors and even wristwatches 
contact lenses have joined the growing ranks of throwaway items 
cheaper lenses now can be worn for a week or two and tossed in the 
trash if they hurt your eye just take them out and put in a new 
pair no more expensive cleaning solutions no more tenderloving 
care

soft contact lenses those floppy pieces 
of plastic that help people see without wearing eyeglasses have 
reached a popular american culture benchmark theyve become 
disposable 
that could mean a lot of changes involving the way people view 
the little lenses that make things clearer for 23 million americans 
hundreds of thousands of people are already wearing disposable 
lenses even though up to now theyve been available only on a 
limited basis eye doctors are flocking to lectures about them and 
consumers are wondering whats going on 
theyve really captured the interest of the american public 
says dr scott macrae an ophthalmologist from portland ore who 
is also a consultant to the food and drug administration for 
ophthalmic devices 
he speaks from experience he wears a disposable lens in his 
right eye 
i dont think weve ever seen anything in my experience that 
gained this kind of acceptance says hal johnson president of 
professional products at bausch amp lomb the nations leading seller 
of contact lenses were in high gear and i mean high gear 
it hasnt been too long ago that basketball games were stopped 
while players scoured the floor for a missing contact lens most 
people still coddle and clean their lenses treating them like tiny 
treasures 
they even buy insurance policies to protect them from loss or 
damage 
now along come some lenses that can be worn for a week or two 
and tossed in the trash if they hurt your eye just take them out 
and put in a new pair no more expensive cleaning solutions no 
more tenderloving care 
is wear em and toss em the wave of the future 
probably not say officials at bausch amp lomb and other eye care 
experts 
the main reason is that most of the most of the lenses available 
can only be worn by patients who are nearsighted another negative 
factor is the cost between 300 and 500 per year 
disposable contacts were introduced in the united states in july 
1987 by vistakon inc a subsidiary of johnson amp johnson which up 
until march was the only maker of a disposable lens with national 
distribution vistakons throwaway lenses are called accuvue 
bausch amp lomb started selling disposable contacts nationally in 
march and ciba vision the secondleading maker has started 
selling disposable contacts in california that can be worn by both 
nearsighted and farsighted people 
cibas kim little says lenses called newvues should be 
available nationally later this year 
johnson says bausch amp lomb expects that between 10 percent and 
20 percent of all contact lens wearers in the country will switch 
to disposable lenses 
but even that small percentage will have astounding business 
implications for the contact lens industry 
consider that a patient who normally would have walked into an 
optometrists office and left with a new pair of lenses could now 
walk away with u to 52 pairs of lenses 
the average disposable customer using either a oneweek or a 
twoweek replacement schedule will use 39 pairs of lenses a year 
that means that instead of selling four million lenses a year to 
the roughly 2 million disposable customers eye doctors will sell 
156 million lenses a year 
bausch amp lomb is expanding its three largest contact lens 
manufacturing plants including the renovation of an area in 
rochester roughly the size of two football fields that will be 
devoted to the companys seequence line of disposable lenses 
this flurry of activity is all possible because bausch amp lomb 
and vistakon have been able to dramatically lower the cost of 
making a contact lens 
irving aarons a stock analyst for arthur d little in 
cambridge mass estimates that bausch amp lomb can make a 
disposable lens for less than 1 maybe as low as 75 cents it 
sells two lenses for 5 to practitioners who turn around and sell 
them for 7 to 10

<TEXT>
the companys standard lens costs about 130 to make and is 
sold for between 15 to 30 aarons says practitioners will sell 
each of those lenses for 40 to 50 
theyre selling a smaller number of lenses for a wider margin 
now but with disposables theyll be selling a huge number of 
lenses for a smaller margin aarons says 
more important than the business implications disposable 
contact lenses are going to play a key role in ushering in a whole 
new era in eye care among the many wearers of contact lenses in the 
united states 
one of the things that were seeing is that with the 
introduction of disposable lenses people are understanding that 
frequent lens replacement is a viable option says david archer 
director of marketing for bausch amp lombs professional products 
division 
the average contact lens wearer replaces one lens a year archer 
says and usually suffers some discomfort or some difficulty with a 
lens before deciding to replace it 
if people begin to think that contact lenses are expendable he 
says they will be more likely to replace them as often as every 
week or at least once a year 
the only real difference between a dailywear soft contact lens 
and a disposable lens is the recommended wearing time both are 
made of flexible plastic 
disposable lenses and extendedwear lenses are slightly thinner 
than dailywear lenses making them slightly more comfortable but 
slightly less durable 
the label on the disposable lens container notes the lenses are 
only fda approved for a maximum of two weeks at a time doctors 
were concerned that people wouldnt comply with the recommended 
wearing time but so far studies are indicating that the compliance 
rate is very high 
as far as cost bausch amp lomb has streamlined the technique used 
to make a contact lens and can now manufacture lenses 70 percent 
faster than several years ago the increased volume has allowed the 
price to fall 
bausch amp lomb also offers a frequent lens replacement program 
that allows patients to get new lenses at different intervals such 
as once a month or once every three months and requires them to 
stick the discarded lenses on a card and mail them back to the 
company to insure compliance 
archer likens it to the dental care industrys effort that 
started three decades ago to promote the benefits of regular 
checkups and teeth cleaning to prevent tooth decay 
dr augustus falcone a rochester optometrist who specializes in 
contact lenses agrees with archer 
if you tell a patient about being able to change lenses every 
week it starts the negotiation falcone says ok you dont 
want to change your lenses every week how about every month how 
about every three months whatever they pick is better than what 
they have now 
studies have shown that frequent replacement of lenses at 
intervals suggested by eye doctors can greatly reduce the risk of 
getting a severe eye injury from a contact lens macrae says 
if disposable lenses get people to change their lenses more 
often then theyve probably done a good thing he says 
but macrae and many other eye doctors still are not convinced 
that extendedwear contact lenses like disposable contacts are 
completely safe no matter how often you replace them 
he said a new study of 22000 extendedwear contact lens wearers 
indicates that they are three to five times more likely to suffer a 
serious eye injury than someone who takes his lenses out at night 
we dont know why this is but my hunch is that an 
extendedwear user doesnt get enough oxygen to the cornea and this 
can cause problems macrae says 
falcone learned about the disposability of contact lenses nine 
years ago when professional golfer calvin peete came to him in the 
middle of a golf tournament in rochester because he had torn a 
contact lens 
he could have won 24000 and he had to withdraw because of a 
little piece of plastic falcone says i mean holy mackerel 
whats a lens so i started sending him fistfuls of lenses

a group of black employees is suing the 
pillsbury co accusing the food conglomerate of routinely engaging 
in race discrimination in hiring promoting compensating and 
disciplining black workers 
the complaint was filed monday in us district court in 
minneapolis on behalf of eight pillsbury employees and one person 
who applied for but failed to get a job with the company a judge 
will rule in about six months whether to certify the suit a class 
action representing present and former black employees 
paul sprenger the attorney representing the nine plaintiffs 
said their experiences at the company indicate widespread racist 
employment practices 
blacks are routinely put in the slow track as opposed to the 
fast track and reach the level beyond which they cant go and 
become frustrated sprenger said 
the complaint says one of the nine plaintiffs freida hodges of 
minneapolis applied for a job at pillsbury but was rejected 
because of her race the other eight all employees experienced 
discrimination in promotions unfair performance evaluations and 
harassment the suit says 
pillsbury which was acquired in january by grand metropolitan 
plc of london said monday that it has carefully reviewed the 
allegations in the complaint and concluded that they have no basis 
in fact 
most of the allegations involve alleged incidents which took 
place before grand metropolitan acquired pillsbury the company 
said pillsbury and grand met are strongly committed to the 
principle of equal employment opportunities for all employees and 
prospective employees 
sprenger said he began investigating the case two years ago he 
said that during that time he talked to the company in an effort to 
reach a settlement before filing a complaint but was unsuccessful 
part of the problem was getting a management decision because 
of the recent takeover he said 
sprenger is nationally known for his successful litigation in 
employment discrimination he has participated in many of the major 
classaction employment cases in minnesota rajender vs the 
university of minnesota national organization for women vs the 3m 
co and holden et al vs burlington northern 
it is an easy case to resolve if a serious commitment to 
future hiring and promotion practices can be addressed he said 
the complaint included a copy of a list of racist jokes that was 
freely circulated and condoned by pillsbury management 
employees sprenger said one of the plaintiffs diana sanders a 
secretary who was terminated in march in companywide layoffs 
obtained the list from upperlevel managers 
the complaint filed monday is the second class action 
racediscrimination complaint leveled at the company in 1974 a 
black woman charged race and sex discrimination after she was fired 
from her managementlevel job the case wound its way up to the 
eighth us circuit court of appeals before it was settled in 1984 
out of court 
sprenger said that because the settlement did not require 
pillsbury to change its employment and promotion practices it has 
perpetuated race discrimination

does anyone know the price anymore of an 
automobile a fastfood meal an airplane ticket a bag of lawn 
fertilizer or a dozen other products that might come to mind 
pricing no longer is simple and straightforward it is tricky 
confusing surprising exasperating and inexplicable to mention a 
few characteristics someone with imagination could make a list 
that would gird the globe 
retailer discounts manufacturer discounts discountoption 
packages sales rebates belowcost financing fees specials 
exceptions and exemptions produce a challenge to which few buyers 
are equal 
the time of day on which you make your phone calls can mean full 
price or a 65 percent discount but that isnt the only thing that 
complicates your phone bill do you own your phone or do you rent 
do you own or rent the jacks 
the day of the week on which you travel by air can mean paying 
halfprice or regular price but the discount might be available 
only if you fly through a certain city on the way to your 
destinationif there is room on the flight 
do you know how interest is assessed on your credit card or 
whether you pay an annual service fee do you know the rate or 
how much it has changed in the past few months bluntly speaking 
do you know what your card costs 
the difficulty in pricing was illustrated in recent weeks when 
general motors and ford raised prices on options but not the basic 
prices of all cars the effect is to further complicate attempts to 
assess prices 
gm for example increased by 10 each the prices of power 
windows power door locks and cruise control it raised air 
conditioning 20 and automatic transmissions 25 the result 
higher car costs no matter what they say 
ford increased prices of power door locks power windows power 
mirrors and cruise control by 8 but it retained discountoption 
packages in which option items have a lower total price when 
purchased together rather than separately 
partly as a consequence of such complicated pricing it becomes 
nearly impossible to estimate the price of an automobile from the 
prices advertised which often are for barebones vehicles price 
tags become comeons 
it happens in fastfood restaurants too the big sign advertises 
a juicy hamburger with lettuce and tomato for 199 but when the 
bill comes it adds up to more than 4 the cheese costs 75 cents 
the side salad about the same the small cola tea or coffee costs 
70 cents and sometimes more than 1 
over at the local lending institution meanwhile theyre 
pushing lowcost mortgages but are points included at the real 
estate office they offer help in getting a mortgage but do they 
mention they might take a fee for doing so 
so you buy the house and get to work on the lawn at the garden 
store theyre having their spring sale and that means fertilizer 
rebates lets see theres the regular price the retailer 
discount and the manufacturers rebate which you claim by mail 
with proof of purchase and a sales ticket many forget to do so 
you dont go overboard on landscaping because you know that real 
estate taxes soon will be due you thought you knew the exact tax 
down to the penny until they reassessed the town they raised 
assessments 93 percent but lowered the mill rate 62 percent so 
that leaves you owing an indeterminate sum

pan am corp announced today it is considering 
making an offer for nwa inc the parent of northwest airlines 
which is the target of several takeover suitors 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett made the surprise announcement 
to shareholders at the financially troubled airlines annual 
meeting in washington 
he said pan ams move is in response to nwas general request 
for such proposals nwa already has received a 27 billion 
takeover offer from investor marvin davis and the airlines unions 
have said they also are interested in possibly buying the carrier 
a marriage of pan am and northwest would create one of the most 
farreaching airlines with routes worldwide and further 
consolidate the landscape of the deregulated us airline industry 
nwa didnt specifically approach pan am to make an offer pan am 
spokeswoman pamela hanlon said 
plaskett said pan am has retained prudentialbache securities 
inc and airlie group lp as financial advisers but did not disclose 
any possible details of a bid for nwa 
prudentialbache is considering providing very significant 
new equity for pan am to acquire nwa and anticipates arranging the 
remaining financing if pan am actually makes a bid he said 
plaskett told airline analysts several months ago that pan am 
probably would have difficulty ensuring its financial survival 
without merging with another carrier 
the linkage of two airlines with virtually no overlapping 
routes into a single global carrier would create a formidable us 
challenger to the rapidly expanding foreign megacarriers 
plaskett told the shareholders 
the combination would be especially significant given the 
heritage and reservoir of international experience which the 
employees of the two carriers contribute 
the recent developments at nwa have created a unique 
opportunity to pursue an idea that makes good business sense and 
one that will position pan am and northwest to grow together into a 
world leader in international aviation 
pan am and its financial advisors believe that the business 
economics of the combined entities could easily support a fully 
financed cash offer at an attractive price there are still a 
number of complex issues to examine including transitional labor 
agreements and the specific terms of an offer before we will 
proceed with a bid 
northwests pacific routes to the orient and europe would 
dovetail with pan ams large international operations that are 
strong in atlantic routes and to latin america 
trading in shares of both companies was halted shortly before 
the announcement after it resumed pan am rose 25 cents a share to 
500 on the new york stock exchange and nwa rose 62 cents a 
share to 10512 
northwest the nations fourthlargest airline generally is 
considered one of the most profitable pan am on the other hand 
has been racked by losses for several years and has asked its 
unions to take pay cuts 
pan am the eighthlargest recently reported that its 
firstquarter loss widened to 1511 million from 833 million a 
year earlier due in part to a decline in business after the 
bombing of its flight 103 over lockerbie scotland in december 
pan am reported 7335 million in revenue for the first three 
months of 1989 down from 7639 million a year earlier 
nwa by contrast reported its largest firstquarter profit of 
the decade 
firstquarter earnings were 126 million or 43 cents a share 
compared with a net loss of 435 million in the first quarter of 
1988 
nwas revenue in the quarter jumped 193 percent to 148 
billion from 124 billion a year earlier 
kurt rivard an airline analyst for dain bosworth inc in 
minneapolis said a merger of the two carriers is plausible 
they do make a very interesting fit he said there is not 
much overlap in the domestic routes and while northwest is strong 
in the pacific pan am is fairly significant elsewhere in the world 
an acquisition or a merger for northwest from a company point 
of view makes a lot of sense he said theyre very 
compatible 
rivard said there may be some accounting benefits in pan am the 
smaller of the two acquiring northwest he said there could be tax 
losses at pan am that could be carried forward

texaco inc stockholders meeting for the first 
time since the oil giant began a postbankruptcy restructuring 
were told today the company has bounced back with a vengeance 
since last year we have gone from a period of promise to a 
period of heightened performance said james w kinnear texacos 
president and chief executive officer 
kinnear and texaco chairman alfred c decrane jr told the 
annual meeting the company is ready to reclaim its place as an 
industry leader because of the restructuring 
texaco the nations thirdlargest oil company asked a federal 
bankruptcy court in 1987 to protect it from creditors the move 
followed a 103 billion judgment won against texaco by pennzoil 
co which charged texaco with blocking pennzoils plans to acquire 
getty oil co 
texaco based in white plains ny emerged from chapter 11 
last year and launched a restructuring program that included the 
projected sale of more than 5 billion in operating assets 
texacos first quarter 1989 net income was 14 million 
there are clear signs that were on the right path decrane 
said 
shareholders today voted in favor of a number of items 
including the election of five board members two special dividends 
totaling about 2 billion and a new poison pill plan designed 
to thwart unwanted takeover attempts 
the shareholders defeated two separate proposals aimed at 
getting the company to curtail operations in south africa and also 
rejected a proposal to make proxy voting confidential 
company officials were still counting late votes on the 
proposals today keeping final tallies from being made available 
immediately

a mammoth soviet vessel helping clean up 
the alaskan oil spill cant handle the hardened taffylike crude 
and is being sent home authorities said today 
the hightech 425foot vaydaghubsky which has been under a 
15000aday monthlong exxon contract to skim the oil spilled 
march 24 did not have its contract renewed 
exxon and state officials said the ship had difficulty 
processing the mousse the hardened oil that develops after 
crude has spent days in the chilly alaskan waters buffeted by 
winds and currents 
we shouldnt blame the russians said bill rainey exxon 
operations manager it was just not the type of oil she was good 
in 
on monday exxon said it has spent more than 95 million to 
clean up the spill and could have contained much of the crude if 
authorities hadnt blocked early use of chemical dispersants but a 
top state official accused exxon of spreading a fabrication and 
said the oil giant had not sought to employ dispersants 
also monday gov steve cowper signed a bill raising taxes on 
the nations two largest oil fields both on alaskas north slope 
he said the spill helped make the increase possible 
exxon executives disclosed their cleanup costs at the end of a 
stormy twoday congressional subcommittee hearing in valdez the 
95 million figure doesnt include the cost of government 
operations or fishermens losses 
the executives told the fivemember subcommittee of the house 
interior committee that they could have contained perhaps half of 
the spill had they been allowed to use powerful chemical 
dispersants soon after the accident 
they said the coast guard and the state department of 
environmental conservation rejected their requests to use the 
chemicals widely 
we came to alaska to use dispersants exxon shipping co 
president frank iarossi said i was pleading on my part to begin 
dispersal use we were very aggressive 
were confident that had we obtained prompt permission to use 
the dispersant the environmental damage would have been 
mitigated exxon usa president bill stevens said 
dennis kelso commissioner of the department of environmental 
conservation called exxons account a fabrication he said the 
state had preapproved the use of dispersants in parts of prince 
william sound before the march 24 spill 
dispersants were not used extensively in the three days 
following the tanker accident because the winds and seas were too 
calm to provide the turbulence necessary to mix them with oil 
kelso said in a statement 
the day before kelso told the subcommittee that exxon and 
alyeska which operates the transalaska pipeline spread 
disinformation by contending they sought to use dispersants 
kelso testified that exxon did not request permission to use the 
chemicals 
vice adm clyde robbins the coast guards no 2 man in the 
spill zone said exxon and alyeska did not urge the use of 
dispersants smallscale tests of the chemicals proved inconclusive 
neither of them had the equipment on site to deal with it 
either through mechanical means or chemical means he added 
he also said a contingency plan at alyeska was inadequate to 
deal with a major spill but stevens said the state earlier had 
endorsed the plan 
the former captain of the vessel joseph hazelwood 42 is 
accused of operating the ship while intoxicated and faces trial 
june 20 in valdez 
cowper signed the new tax bill after the senate approved it by 
119 the bill will bring in 235 million in revenue next year and 
more than 2 billion during the next two decades based on current 
oil prices 
oil industry officials had argued that changing the tax formula 
ultimately will cost the state jobs and oil revenue 
theres no doubt about the fact that the spill made the 
political atmosphere different from what it was before cowper 
said it became a matter of competing credibility the 
credibility of the state versus the credibility of the industry 
the cleanup continued in prince william sound where the exxon 
valdez ran aground and spilled more than 10 million gallons of 
crude

general motors corp said today it planned to 
shut down some of its assembly plants for a month or longer during 
the summer to help reduce inventories and provide time for plant 
retooling 
there has been speculation that gm ford motor co and chyrsler 
corp would have longerthannormal changeover times because of 
slow sales and ambitious production during the first three months 
of the year 
that combination boosted inventories and prompted automakers to 
expand incentive programs as the second quarter of the year got 
under way 
automakers typically shut down production in the late summer to 
accommodate vacation periods and retool assembly lines for the 
coming model year 
the shutdown time varies depending on the extent of the 
changeover but is usually at least two weeks 
gm spokeswoman marcia mcgee said today the companys carmaking 
plant in flint would be closed between july 13 and aug 7 and 
plants in wentzville mo and orion township in oakland county 
would be closed for about a month each during june and july 
she called the shutdown time normal 
we do a lot of retooling line rearrangement she said 
even though there is not a significant new product there are a 
lot of manufacturing changes for future product that is not 
apparent 
she said production at the companys plant in ypsilanti would be 
shut down from may 19 until early next year for changes linked to a 
new fullsize rearwheeldrive model 
wards automotive reports said gm planned to stop production at 
assembly plants in doraville ga fairfax kan and wilmington 
del and hamtramck mich from a month to six weeks during the 
summer 
gm corporate spokesmen had no comment on general shutdown plans 
calls to gms major carmaking groups were referred to each of gms 
five carmaking divisions 
there are no plans for extended shutdowns at ford assembly 
plants this summer spokesman joel pitcoff said 
however he said there are discussions going on about whether to 
tack one week on to the normal twoweek summer vactationretooling 
period at plants in chicago atlanta st thomas ontario and 
wixom mich as the company installs driverside air bags in 
models that lacked them previously 
chrysler spokesman doug nicoll said plant closing schedules for 
model changeover time have not been announced traditionally he 
said the company staggers the closings in june july and august 
im not aware of any longerthannormal times for 
changeovers he said

investigators told a special senate committee 
today that a wichita kan company has been stealing oil from 
indian lands for at least the last three years 
documents subpoenaed from koch industries show that the company 
consistently ended the year with hundreds of thousands more barrels 
of oil than it pays for investigators told a special panel of the 
senate select committee on indian affairs 
a woman at kochs public relations office in wichita said nobody 
was available immediately to comment on the testimony 
although measurement difficulties make it normal for oil 
companies to pay for less oil than they actually take even up to 
12000 barrels a year koch documents showed the firm ended 1986 
with 803874 excess barrels 1987 with 671144 excess barrels and 
1988 with 474281 more barrels than it paid for witnesses said 
chris tucker an independent oil and gas expert said normal 
procedure is for oil companies to compensate for overages by 
shorting themselves in future purchases 
the volumes for the three years shown in the koch documents were 
worth about 121 million 119 million and 71 million 
respectively 
many of the koch oil purchases were made on indian lands with 
royalties from the oil due to indian tribes or individual indians 
chuck norman an accountant for the special committee said it 
is easy to steal from the indians because nobody watches the 
purchasers like koch take oil from the tanks at the well 
furthermore witnesses said substantial confusion exists among 
federal agencies about who is supposed to police the taking of oil 
from indian lands 
tucker said koch used various means to mismeasure oil he showed 
a videotape he secretly made of a koch employee taking oil at a 
northern ute indian oil field in utah he said it showed that the 
employee did not follow all the procedures necessary to accurately 
measure the oil 
under questioning norman said evidence was being gathered on 
other companies as well and would be turned over to authorities 
we are not a grand jury said sen dennis deconcini 
dariz the panels chairman we are attempting to zero in on 
the problem and how it happens 
in an interview before the hearings began deconcini and sen 
john mccain rariz said the committees findings will be turned 
over to the justice department which could seek indictments 
this thing is a mammoth problem said deconcini if wed 
had another year we may have found more 
he said investigators hid behind bushes in the oil fields and 
saw companies mismeasure the amount of oil they took from wells 
many of the areas are so remote that no one supervises the 
action he said 
the senators said none of the top seven oil corporations is 
involved though the ones that are involved are multimilliondollar 
operations they are mostly independent middlelevel 
companies they said 
earl ross spokesman for the american petroleum institute said 
none of the companies is a member of his organization which is the 
largest oil trade association in the country 
but he said the institute supplied the committee with technical 
information on how to measure oil 
the hearings on oil companies this week and the indian health 
service next week are the second segment of a series being 
conducted by the special panel 
in february the panel investigated contracting fraud organized 
crime and child abuse on indian reservations and among those doing 
business with them 
the hearings on the health service are expected to reveal 
gross mismanagement said the senators 
its a tragedy of all tragedies said deconcini saying the 
health service provided care at less than the norm for the 
nation 
mccain said the goal of the committee is to determine how well 
the federal government is fulfilling its responsibility to the 
indians 
our job is to review policies programs and management so we 
can recommend changes so problems wont happen again he said 
deconcini said he expected to have a report on all the 
committees findings by october

in a bid to generate excitement for cbs fall 
television programs and gain publicity for k mart corp the tv 
network and the retailer plan a big national promotion tied to the 
september premiere of cbs shows 
the promotion will be built around a viewer involvement game and 
will be plugged on the cbs tv network on cbs radio and in national 
magazines newspapers and in special k mart sunday newspaper 
circulars 
game cards and instructions will be distributed nationwide in k 
mart sunday circulars for three weeks k mart and cbs will alert 
viewers in print and via electronic media how to play and which 
shows to watch 
more than 6 million prizes will be offered including 12 grand 
prizes that include minivans and family vacations to hollywood 
most of the prizes can be redeemed at the 2200 k mart stores 
nationwide 
the promotion described in a news release as the largest ever 
in tv history and one of the biggest general mass merchandise 
pitches in retail history has a twofold purpose 
for cbs it apparently is intended to encourage viewers to 
switch on the networks new schedule and hopefully get hooked while 
playing the game 
well involve huge numbers of viewers in an exciting way to 
generate tremendous awareness and attention for our new programs 
and our new schedule said george f schweitzer a cbs senior 
vice president who oversees the networks advertising promotion 
and publicity nothing on this scale has been attempted before 
jerry k habeck k marts director of advertising said the 
retailer is hoping to win new customers through the promotional 
link with cbs 
when our agency suggested we use our stores as media 
outlets to develop a major promotion with a network we saw it 
as an opportunity to further enhance our image and gain recognition 
as the place where america shops for everyday low prices on quality 
items habeck said 
k mart the second largest retailer in the country has been 
facing stiffer competition since industry leader sears roebuck and 
co introduced a new lowpricing policy earlier this year 
the troy michbased retailer which has conducted promotions 
with celebrities including actress jaclyn smith and golfer fuzzy 
zoeller will display advertisements for cbs programs in its 
stores 
special cbs videos about its new programs will be aired in k 
marts and all tv monitors in k marts electronics departments will 
be tuned to local cbs affiliates celebrity appearances and other 
instore activities are planned 
k mart apparently isnt concerned about possible negative 
consequences if new cbs shows lag in ratings 
a k mart official who asked not to be identified by name said no 
one can predict how the new shows will fare and the retailer is 
just intending to capitalize on the excitement at the beginning of 
the season 
schweitzer of cbs said k mart has not been granted an option to 
preview the fall lineup and the network doesnt anticipate that its 
shows will be objectionable to anyone this network doesnt have 
those kind of problems to any large degree he said 
numerous advertisers recently have yanked their commercial 
support from programs after special interest groups complained 
about the contents 
the amount of money cbs and k mart will spend on the promotion 
was not disclosed

wheat futures prices fell moderately tuesday on 
the chicago board of trade on perceptions that growing conditions 
are gradually improving 
i think you saw some profittaking and i think some people 
looked at the weather forecast said katharina zimmer 
grainmarket analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc in new 
york 
soybean futures ended mostly higher on persistent rumors of 
soviet buying interest while corn futures ended narrowly mixed 
mondays sixto10day forecast from the national weather 
service predicted normal rainfall and normal temperatures early 
next week in most major us crop areas 
rain would bring little relief to winterwheat farmers in 
kansas because its too late to revive the sizable portion of that 
crop damaged by lack of moisture and extreme temperatures 
but showers would improve the prospects for getting the spring 
wheat crop off to a good start in the northern plains analysts 
said 
the contract for may delivery of wheat plunged 10 cents a 
bushel but analysts attributed the drop to factors surrounding the 
contracts upcoming expiration rather than supplyanddemand 
fundamentals 
at the close wheat settled 3 cents to 10 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 426 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
lower to cent higher with may at 277 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 4 cents lower with may at 188 a bushel soybeans were

uncertainty set in

enthusiastic response from foreign investors to the treasurys 
975 billion sale of threeyear notes 
apparently the auction didnt go so well said michael metz 
vice president of oppenheimer amp co 
before the sale observers had predicted that stock prices would 
follow the bond markets reaction 
analysts said the stock market also remained cautious in 
anticipation of fridays government report on producer prices 
which will provide additional information about the economys 
growth 
the producer price index has particular significance for the 
market after last weeks unemployment report which provided mixed 
signals traders said 
the report showed unemployment rose 03 percentage point to 53 
percent in april indicating a slowdown in economic growth but the 
market focused on the part of the report showing hourly earnings 
rose seven cents suggesting inflation might still be a problem 
so the concern is shifting to stagflation said alfred e 
goldman vice president of the investment firm ag edwards amp sons 
inc stagflation refers to a condition of stagnant economic growth 
coupled with inflation

federal prosecutors have brought more 
moneylaundering charges against a luxembourg banking group adding 
two employees as defendants and implicating the banks colombian 
branch office 
the charges were contained in a new indictment against the bank 
of credit and commerce international holdings sa which us 
senate testimony has linked to money laundering by panamas 
military leader gen manuel antonio noreiga 
the new indictment was returned by a grand jury in tampa last 
week and made public monday 
in what was called a landmark case against an international 
financial institution the bank was charged in october with 
laundering 14 million in cocaine profits collected in seven us 
cities 
some of the new charges apparently were based on testimony from 
convicted smugglerturnedinformant steven michael kalish kalish 
won a sentence reduction from 14 to 10 years last week because of 
his cooperation with federal authorities 
the new indictment also combines the bank case and a related 
moneylaundering indictment against gonzalo mora jr a colombian 
businessman 
larry barcella one of the banks washington attorneys said the 
government was merely trying to shore up its case the revised 
charges are a simple transparent attempt by prosecutors to 
resolve challenges the bank has raised in court filings seeking to 
dismiss the indictment he said 
moras attorney george tragos said his client was being 
penalized by having his case merged with the banks case 
mr mora cant possibly defend himself in a case that is so 
large said tragos he doesnt have the resources to match an 
international bank or the government 
the bank indictment was one of three formal charges returned 
here after a twoyear us customs service sting in which agents 
laundered 32 million in drug proceeds for colombian cocaine 
cartels the sting led to the indictment of 82 people in six cities 
the new indictment includes allegations that kalish laundered 
millions of his smuggling rings profits through the banks 
panamanian and colombian branches 
kalish linked the bank and noriega to his tampabased smuggling 
ring during us senate testimony in january 1988 
prosecutors have said that his testimony was the key to 
noriegas indictment in february 1988 on drug charges here and in 
miami 
kalish was sentenced in february 1988 as the marshal of a ring 
that smuggled 500000 pounds of marijuana and 2000 pounds of 
cocaine from colombia

will strive toward price stability and review its petroleum 
production at a summer meeting 
subroto secretary general of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries made the remarks upon arriving on a flight 
from frankfurt to dallasfort worth international airport 
subroto accompanied by his personal secretary said he would 
meet wednesday morning with texas railroad commissioner kent hance 
at a breakfast session hances commission regulates the texas oil 
industry and he has been an active observer of opec meetinggs in 
the past 
the message is that the member countries are striving toward 
price stability at about 18 per barrel subroto said 
it was subrotos first american appearance since taking the opec 
job last july he was scheduled to address a thursday luncheon 
sponsored by southern methodist universitys institute for the 
study of earth and man in his only planned us talk this year 
subrotos presentation longterm prospects for oil 
stability at the fairmont hotel in dallas was expected to 
attract an estimated 1000 oil and gas industry representatives and 
others from the southwest 
formerly indonesias minister of mines and energy subroto was 
credited with developing a production agreement signed by opec 
members the pact has prompted an increase in oil prices since last 
november 
subroto said he believed the performance of opec member 
countries based on that agreement was pretty satisfactory 
based in vienna austria opecs 13 member countries have been 
instrumental in setting and maintaining worldwide oil prices 
the organization has been watched closely by other petroleum 
producing countries in anticipation of opecs june 5 meeting in 
vienna oil analysts have expressed concern following a 50 percent 
price increase in past months and production levels that appear to 
be rising 
strong demand has caused oil price rallies with the latest 
coming last week after reports of a delay in repairing the north 
seas cormorant alpha platform hit by an april 18 explosion

the late bid monday 
ross taylor a senior vice president at kemper currency inc 
said us market participants became leery of having their currency 
portfolios heavily weighted in favor of the dollar despite comments 
from west german and swiss authorities indicating that they were 
not worried by current dollar levels 
some participants may be unwilling to add to their dollar 
positions ahead of inflation statistics due later this week he 
said the labor department is to issue the april producer price 
index on friday 
also discouraging buyers was a feeling in the us market that 
the dollar had gone up far enough after hitting a ninemonth high 
against the west german mark monday 
earlier the dollar advanced on european markets to its highest 
level against the mark since last august lifted by perceptions 
that the us economy continues to grow strongly enough to keep 
interest rates aloft 
foreign exchange dealers in europe said there had been no sign 
of concerted intervention by central banks to sell dollars in order 
to hold down the exchange rate although the bank of japan and bank 
of england apparently did so on their own us dealers didnt 
detect any interventions during us trading 
central bank dollar sales in the past few weeks has not diluted 
the currencys value and has been considered a largely symbolic 
attempt to remind the markets that authorities are monitoring 
exchange rates 
in europe the dollar reached 19158 west german marks up from 
18975 on monday and its highest level since aug 22 last year 
when it stood at 19190 dealers said they expect the dollar to 
test the 192 marks level this week

from 19097 on monday the highest point since august 1988 
in london one british pound cost 16605 late tuesday cheaper

international business machines corp tuesday 
announced two new personal computers one that is slightly cheaper 
than before and another that is slightly lighter 
neither machine broke new ground but ibm the world leader in 
personal computer market share is hoping the models will attract 
more customers to its 2yearold personal system2 line 
in another step ibm is expected to tie its pcs more closely to 
its bigger computers next week by announcing programs that have the 
same look and feel across the product spectrum 
one of the machines announced tuesday the model 55 sx uses a 
simplified version of intel corps 80386 chip which several other 
personal computer makers including compaq computer corp have 
already adopted 
ibm said the model would be its cheapest 80386based personal 
computer yet with versions listed at 3895 and 4295 
the other new machine the p70 386 is the first portable model 
at the high end of ibms line it is bigger and heavier than a 
laptop and cannot run on batteries it weighs 20 pounds and 
measures 12 inches by 18 inches by 5 inches versions are listed at 
7695 and 8295 
ibm also announced rebates ranging up to 800 on the baselayer 
software operating system2 which runs on many ps2 computers and 
other makes of highpowered personal computers 
the rebates are to offset the expense of buying the extra 
internal memory that the complex baselayer software requires 
ibm plans to announce next tuesday a collection of programs 
under the officevision family label that should make computing 
simpler by standardizing the appearance and format of the software 
the new york times reported tuesday 
ibm executives declined to comment on the report but the idea 
fits in with the companys stated strategy 
for example ibm is working to make it possible for someone at a 
networked personal computer to issue commands at the keyboard 
without knowing what computer is doing the work or where the 
information is coming from executives said 
by reducing complexity from the users point of view it 
levels the playing field so to speak robert carberry vice 
president of systems in ibms entry systems division said in an 
interview

airline industry officials hope plans to 
extensively repair and modify 1300 older boeing jets will help 
answer demands to ensure the safety of older passenger aircraft 
but some congressional staff members say it wont be enough 
in the 13 months since the top ripped off an aloha airlines 737 
over hawaii killing a flight attendant boeing co airlines and 
the federal aviation administration have hustled to reassure the 
public that older commercial jetliners are safe 
the national transportation safety board is expected to issue 
its report on the accident this month 
also expected soon are proposed faa rules ordering 161 
structural repairs and modifications for 1300 older boeing 727s 
737s and 747s the estimated 600000 worth of repairs per plane 
will include replacing skin rivets and other parts that get worn 
as a plane ages 
after the orders dealing with boeing planes are issued 
agingjet task forces will deal with planes made by mcdonnell 
douglas corp lockheed corp europes airbus industrie convair 
fokker and british aircraft corp 
according to aviation consultant avmark inc 832 or almost 29 
percent of the nations commercial jetliners were at least 20 
years old as of last july more than 15 percent or 422 of the 
jets were between 15 and 19 years old 
bill becker a seattle aviation consultant said the rules 
should subdue what he calls the congressional dragon 
hell continue to snort and vibrate but he will be 
appeased becker said 
maybe not james berard a spokesman for minnesota democratic 
rep james oberstar who heads the house subcomittee on aviation 
said the modifications dont go far enough 
these fixes are still far short of what congressman oberstar 
had in mind berard said there will be further investigation 
into the question to determine if additional legislation is 
needed 
faa spokesman david duff in seattle declined to discuss the 
rules until they are formally released but the seattle 
postintelligencer on monday cited industry sources as saying they 
are expected to involve the following 
seventyfour repairs to about 800 boeing 727s with 60000 or 
more takeoff and landing cycles or 60000 hours of flight

straight day tuesday reflecting worries about the tight 
availability of highquality arabica coffee beans 
on other markets pork futures were up strongly while cattle 
prices were mixed energy futures rose precious metals were 
higher and grains and soybeans were mixed 
coffee settled 81 cent lower to 275 cents higher on new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in 
may up 275 cents at 14125 a pound 
the sharp runup in the may delivery price followed an exchange 
report showing the amount of warehoused coffee available for 
delivery against the may contract at a 5year low of less than 
160000 bags each bag contains 132 pounds of green unroasted 
coffee beans 
with so little coffee available for delivery against the may 
contract which expires on may 19 fear of a socalled squeeze 
is building in the market in which the physical availability of a 
commodity is less than the amount required to satisfy all contracts 
there just isnt enough product around said bert ruiz a 
vice president with balfour maclaine corp in new york one reason 
for the supply tightness he said was an 18day dockworkers strike 
earlier this month in the brazilian port of santos the worlds 
busiest coffee port 
frozen porkbelly futures soared the permitted 2centsapound 
limit on the chicago mercantile exchange analysts said the rally 
was supported by strong cash markets but was mainly due to 
technical factors

strong cash markets offset by expectations of seasonal price 
weakness in the coming weeks 
live cattle settled 05 cent lower to 27 cent higher with june 
at 7242 cents a pound feeder cattle were 03 cent to 18 cent

ounce silver was 78 cents to 9 cents higher with july at 5755 a

combination of weakening chart signals and perceptions that growing 
conditions are gradually improving

soviet buying interest while corn futures finished mostly lower

texaco inc officials faced the companys 
stockholders tuesday for the first time since its postbankruptcy 
restructuring saying the problems that jolted the oil giant during 
this decade are over 
after several years of some very special challenges a new 
texaco has emerged a company with its own vision for greatness a 
company with its sights set firmly on the future texaco chairman 
alfred c decrane said at the companys annual stockholders meeting 
in atlanta 
decrane and james w kinnear texacos president and chief 
executive officer presented an optimistic portrayal to the 
attentive gathering 
the officials said the white plains nybased company is in 
good financial health and ready to reclaim its position as an 
industry leader noting the recent exxon valdez oil spill in 
alaska kinnear also stressed that texaco is committed to 
preventing another environmental disaster 
the shareholders voted the company line on proxy matters 
overwhelmingly approving two special dividends worth about 2 
billion a proposal to strengthen the companys defense against 
unsolicited takeover offers an employee compensation plan tied to 
performance the hiring of a new auditor and the election of five 
directors 
the stockholders rejected two separate proposals urging the 
company to curtail its operations in south africa and an item aimed 
at making proxy ballots secret 
texaco the nations thirdlargest oil company asked a federal 
bankruptcy court in 1987 to protect it from creditors the move 
followed a 103 billion judgment won against texaco by pennzoil 
co which charged texaco with blocking pennzoils plans to acquire 
getty oil co 
the company also faced an attempt last year by new york investor 
carl ichan to take over texaco 
texaco emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year 
and launched a restructuring program that included the projected 
sale of more than 5 billion in operating assets in february the 
company completed the sale of texaco canada inc to imperial oil 
ltd for 324 billion 
texaco also reached a standstill agreement with ichan who 
owns 422 million shares or 176 percent of the companys common 
stock under which he would cast his votes in accordance with the 
expressed will of other shareholders 
texacos first quarter 1989 net income was 14 million 
there are clear signs that were on the right path decrane 
said 
true we are trimmer he said but we still provide fully 
5 percent of the free worlds energy needs 
kinnear said texaco is becoming more selective in its 
investments including upgrading its refining capabilities 
exploration efforts and laboratories the company also plans to 
repurchase 500 million worth of texaco stock by august 1990 he 
said 
kinnear also discussed the valdez spill calling it 
regrettable 
he defended texacos environmental record saying its policy is 
to ensure the most stringent training and prevention to ensure 
the safe operation not only of our tanker fleet and fleets but of 
all our operations from rigs to pipelines to refineries and to 
distribution and marketing

one of the nations largest mailorder 
companies spiegel inc has agreed to begin collecting the texas 
sales tax on items shipped into the state comptroller bob bullock 
announced tuesday 
the development is important because many mailorder retailers 
have been fighting legislative proposals that would make them 
collect sales taxes which would raise the prices they charge to 
consumers and eliminate one of the lures of mailorder buying 
bullock who argues that mail order sales deprive the state of 
tax revenue it would collect on identical sales in the state has 
been urging federal approval of legislation to require mail order 
firms to collect sales taxes from states where they do business 
bullock said that spiegel headquartered in oak brook ill 
volunteered to collect the states 6 percent tax 
spiegel inc executives told us that we could expect several 
million dollars a year in state sales taxes thats a lot of 
revenue and its from just one of many mail order companies that 
send their goods to texas bullock said 
officials in the comptrollers tax information division said 
spiegel is the first outofstate company to volunteer to collect 
the texas tax 
mail order firms which are based in texas must collect the tax 
on items sold to texans officials said 
spiegel will begin collecting and reporting the tax beginning 
july 1 bullock said adding that he hopes other companies will 
follow suit 
he said 1987 estimates showed that texans spent nearly 52 
billion on mail order merchandise that would be taxed if sold 
inside the states borders 
i hope that other outofstate mail order firms will follow 
spiegels good publicspirited example not having to collect our 
sales tax gives them an unfair advantage over our local 
businesses he said 
if the federal law is changed to require such collections by 
outofstate companies bullock said texas could expect to take in 
about 130 million more in sales tax revenue annually

gov steve cowper signed into law a bill 
raising oil taxes by 235 million after the oilindustrydominated 
state senate reversed itself in the wake of constituents anger 
over the exxon valdez spill 
cowper saying big oil does not run alaska signed the bill 
three hours after mondays 119 vote thwarting a lastditch move 
in the senate to rescind the vote 
theres no doubt about the fact that the spill made the 
political atmosphere different from what it was before the 
governor said it became a matter of competing credibility the 
credibility of the state vs the credibility of the industry 
oil industry officials argued that changing the tax formula 
ultimately will cost the state jobs and oil revenue 
the bill which eliminates a tax break for the nations two 
largest oil fields will add 235 million to the state treasury 
next year and more than 2 billion over the next two decades based 
on current oil prices already about 85 percent of the states 
22 billion budget comes from oil and gas revenues 
on sunday the state senate which had never before let the bill 
even reach the floor rejected the bill in a 911 vote 
but democratic sen mike szymanski whose district includes 
oilstained prince william sound and republican johne binkley 
reversed their initial no votes providing the needed support 
monday for passage 
the march 24 oil spill polluted the sound with more than 10 
million gallons of north slope crude binkley and szymanski said 
they did not change their vote to punish the industry but both 
said calls from constituents had influenced them 
i think the oil companies by and large have been good 
corporate citizens in the state of alaska binkley said 
but he said he received dozens of phone calls in the hours 
following the first vote most urging him to change his mind a 
brief private talk with cowper who had lobbied heavily for the 
tax also helped change his vote he said 
szymanski who said sunday night that he could not approve a tax 
increase said monday that he concluded the increase was needed to 
ensure that alaska gets its fair share of oil revenue 
i would certainly hope that some of the additional money that 
is made available by the tax would be made available to support 
the local communities that were directly impacted by the oil 
spill he said 
szymanski said his phone rang constantly monday i had a lot 
of pressure on me from the constituency he said 
the new law revises an oiltax break known as the economic limit 
factor or elf cowper and other proponents of the bill said the 
tax break should not apply to the productive prudhoe bay and 
kuparuk oil fields on alaskas north slope 
it took three years for an elf bill to make it to a vote on the 
floor of the republicanled senate long a stronghold of oil 
industry support the democratcontrolled house approved an elf 
bill twice in 1987 and this year 
exxon which has a relatively small share of those two oil 
fields will pay only about 15 percent of the tax increase at 15 
percent the companys share for the first year of the tax increase 
would amount to about 45 million 
bp exploration alaska inc a subsidiary of british petroleum 
will pay about half of the additional taxes 
were disappointed company spokesman paul a laird said 
we think its not in the best interests of the state in the long 
term economicially 
state officials said 150 million of the first years revenue 
from the tax hike will go into the states oilwealth savings 
account which was created to ensure that the state benefits from 
the oil after it is gone 
nearly half of each years earnings from the account are 
distributed to residents last year each qualified resident got 
826 from the fund

investigators implicated a kansasbased oil 
company tuesday in testimony before a senate panel that is checking 
allegations of millions of dollars in oil and royalties being 
stolen from indians 
the investigators told a special unit of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs that koch industries which does a 
large amount of business on indian oilfields over the past three 
years consistently took hundreds of thousands more barrels of crude 
oil than it paid for 
but donald l cordes koch industries vice president for legal 
and corporate affairs said the senate panel didnt reveal that the 
socalled overages were a very small percentage of the total oil 
the company buys and resells he said the committee also has 
information that koch crude oil purchases were measured short the 
first two months of 1989 
for 1988 the koch industries overage was 0023 of the total 
volume of crude oil handled and measured by the company he said 
this percentage is well within the range of overage 
percentages reflected in the reports of the states which compile 
that data cordes said 
there isnt any basis for concluding koch engages in illicit 
measuring practices he said 
a spokesman for the senate panel said that depositions were 
taken with officials of koch though the officials were not called 
to testify tuesday 
a certain amount of mismeasuring is normal in the industry but 
not to the degree shown in documents subpoenaed from koch said 
witnesses 
the documents indicated that koch ended 1986 with 803874 more 
barrels of oil than it paid for 1987 with 671144 more barrels and 
1988 with 474281 more barrels the value of the extra oil for the 
three years was estimated at 122 million 119 million and 71 
million 
most companies try to be as accurate as possible testified 
chris tucker an independent oil expert who investigated koch if 
there are large overages the company should figure out why this is 
happening 
tucker had been hired to investigate the company by a brother of 
the owner charles koch said a senate panel spokesman who 
indicated the two brothers had quarreled 
tucker said that companies normally compensate for overages by 
shorting themselves later and that the figures from koch indicate 
an intent by the company to take more than it pays for 
its very easy to steal from indian lands said tucker 
there are no checks and balances 
he and other witnesses said the fields are in remote areas and 
are not generally watched 
tucker showed the committee a videotape he said he secretly made 
of a koch employee taking oil from a tank on northern ute indian 
land in utah the employee failed to perform all of the measuring 
functions required under american petroleum institute standards 
tucker testified 
chuck norman an investigator for the committee said other oil 
firms also were being probed he said information about them would 
be turned over to authorities 
before the hearings began sen dennis deconcini dariz said 
findings would be given to the justice department which could seek 
indictments 
we are not a grand jury deconcini who chairs the special 
committee said during the hearing we are attempting to zero in 
on the problem and how it happens 
sen john mccain rariz said the purpose of the investigation 
was to determine whether there was mismanagement by the federal 
government and if so what steps congress should take 
norman said there was confusion among the three federal agencies 
that are charged with protecting indian oil rights the bureau of 
land management the bureau of indian affairs and the minerals 
management service about who should be policing the fields 
usually nothing is done about theft he said 
the special committee will be investigating oil and oil royalty 
theft on indian land throughout the week 
the hearings make up the second series since the panel began its 
probe testimony in february alleged corruption in contracting and 
gaming operations on indian reservations and child sex abuse in 
bureau of indian affairs schools 
deconcini said he hopes to have a report by october that will 
lead to changes in the governments approach to the indians

bills were introduced tuesday that would 
require oil companies to be able to handle oil spills within five 
hours and which also would impose a pennyabarrel tax on refined 
oil to finance a 500 million oil spill research and cleanup fund 
a bill by rep jim saxton rnj would require 
industryfinanced emergency response teams certified by the coast 
guard and subject to unannounced drills to be located regionally 
and customdesigned for the environment they are assigned to 
protect 
teams would have to be in place by jan 1 1991 punishment for 
violations would include fines of up to 1 million and oil 
companies chief executive officers would be directly responsible 
for violations 
saxton said this legislation addresses the basic questions 
that everyone has asked all along about the alaskan oil spill in 
march when an exxon tanker struck a reef and more than 10 million 
gallons of crude oil leaked into water in prince william sound 
sen ted stevens ralaska also introduced a legislative 
package that would create a 500 million oil spill research and 
restoration fund administered by the environmental protection 
agency and financed through a pennyabarrel tax on refined 
domestic and imported oil 
at a news conference that also included sen bennett johnston 
dla stevens said the coast guard authority to assume immediate 
control of large or lifethreatening oil spills in prince william 
sound and use industry funds in response to a major spill 
another bill in stevens package would require tankers crossing 
the sound to have equipment and vessels in place in the event of a 
spill and conduct practice drills at least twice yearly the 
stevens bills would allow oil companies to be sued in federal court 
if cleanup promises were not met 
according to capt richard larrabee chief of the environmental 
response division of the coast guard current federal policy holds 
a spiller responsible for timely and effective cleanup of his own 
spill 
in effect if the federal onscene coordinator determines that 
spiller is not acting effectively then he steps in using federal 
resources and cleans it up 
in addition the coast guard has contingency plans in place for 
each of its approximately 48 ports including valdez alaska site 
of the exxon spill 
states also may regulate the industry larrabee said the 
eightmember oil consortium in alaska was required by the state as 
a condition of its operating permit to develop a contingency plan 
that plan indicated the industry could respond within five hours 
although the consortium was not prepared for a spill of the 
magnitude it faced in prince william sound he said

a soviet ship helping clean up the alaskan 
oil spill is being sent home wednesday because the hightech 
skimmer had trouble siphoning thick goo frustrated us officials 
said tuesday 
we shouldnt blame the russians said bill rainey exxons 
operations manager it was just not the type of oil she was good 
in 
the 425foot vaidogubskys pumps and machinery jammed often 
while siphoning mousse the thick goo that hardens as its 
tossed by winds and chilly currents off the water said officials 
directing the cleanup 
but they said the ship was unmatched in skimming the softer 
liquid crude that was in the water immediately after the spill 
nearly seven weeks ago in prince william sound 
if that ship had been available to us in the sound when the 
spill first occurred it would have made a helluva difference 
said vice adm clyde robbins who supervises cleanup work in the 
spill zone 
to this point she hasnt collected a lot of oil he added 
robbins said officials decided late monday night to send the ship 
which has been operating out of seward home on wednesday 
the vessel has been skimming mostly outside the sound where the 
tanker exxon valdez slammed into bligh reef on march 24 and spewed 
more than 10 million gallons of oil into the water 
the oil has killed hundreds of birds and fish and has fouled 
beaches about 450 miles southwest of the spill site including the 
coast of katmai national park 
robbins inspected big smith little smith applegate and seal 
islands in prince william sound on tuesday 
im encouraged with the progress on this island he said on 
applegate as spots of oil glistened in the afternoon sun its a 
heck of a lot better than when i last visited 
the cleanup crew has been on applegate for 13 days hampered by 
lack of equipment and frustrated by seeing the rocks reoiled on 
nearly every high tide 
authorities also extended by five days the deadline for having 
the worst of the oil spill damage cleaned off several islands in 
prince william sound the original deadline of wednesday timed to 
allow seals to use the beaches when giving birth was pushed back 
until may 15 
they dont really start pupping until may 20 but with all the 
activity we thought wed give them a chance to reinhabit the area 
and settle down said alaska department of fish and game 
spokesman bill pilcher 
pilcher said cleanup crews planned to sop up oil on the rocky 
beaches with peat moss stuffing it into oily cracks when the tide 
is low then collecting it from the water when the rising tide 
washes it into the sound 
an oilspill task force of several boats planned to head out 
from kodiak across the shelikof strait to katmai national park a 
wildlife refuge hard hit by the spill but reports of wind gusts 
and 12foot seas kept the vessels in port 
the 11400ton vaidogubsky arrived with great fanfare last 
month but robbins said that by the time the soviet ship reached 
alaskan waters the oil either was too dispersed or too emulsified 
for the ship to work effectively 
the ships arrival marked the second time in six months that the 
soviets had sent a vessel to alaska to provide assistance last 
year a soviet icebreaker worked near barrow to help free two 
trapped california gray whales 
the vaidogubsky worked the southern edge of the kenai peninsula 
chasing the rapidly moving oil slick that seeped out of prince 
william sound and headed southwest toward kodiak island and katmai 
national park on the alaska peninsula 
but the leading edge of the slick broke up before the 
vaidogubsky could do much work we were never able to find oil in 
places it could work robbins said 
exxon officials said they didnt know exactly how much oil the 
ship had collected because it still was being pumped off tuesday

vermont is becoming the first state to 
ban car air conditioners that use a chemical linked to destruction 
of the atmospheres ozone layer which protects the earth from 
harmful ultraviolet radiation 
car air conditioners are the single largest source of the us 
contribution to ozone depletion according to scientists and 
testimony before legislative committees 
gov madeleine kunin has hailed the bill passed may 2 and which 
she is expected to sign within the next two weeks as landmark 
legislation 
we are a role model and we may be a role model for the us 
congress she said 
starting with the 1993 model year the legislation would ban the 
sale or registration of cars equipped with air conditioners that 
use chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs for coolant car air conditioners 
were singled out partly because they use cfc12 considered the 
most damaging type of cfc to the ozone layer home refrigerators 
use a different type of cfc 
when cfc molecules rise in the atmosphere they damage the ozone 
layer 15 to 20 miles up scientists say that lets in extra 
radiation that increases incidences of skin cancer and eye disease 
and damages plants and animals crucial to the food chain 
lobbyist joan mulhern of the vermont public interest research 
group which supported the bill said car air conditioners are the 
single largest source of cfcs producing 266 percent of the amount 
released into the environment 
mulhern based her testimony on studies by the us environmental 
protection agency published in 1987 
the connection between cfcs and the ozone layer is not being 
debated anymore said state rep curt mccormack the bills major 
sponsor the argument is when can you have air conditioners 
without cfcs 
cfcs developed as a refrigerant in 1930 by a general motors 
chemist were considered ideal chemicals because they are nontoxic 
and noncombustible 
the chemicals are widely used as coolants and as propellants 
such as in spray cans under vermonts bill the sale of 
cfcpropelled noisemakers and plastic party streamers as well as 
noncommercial or nonindustrial uses of cfcs for cleaning 
photographic or electronic equipment would be banned next year 
supporters of vermonts legislation say it is the most 
farreaching of any of the two dozen ozoneprotection bills 
introduced in state legislatures this year only legislatures in 
vermont and hawaii have passed ozone protection measures 
hawaiis governor is expected to sign a bill that would ban the 
sale of cfc cartridges for recharging car air conditioners it also 
would raise standards for car air conditioning repair shops 
virtually the only opposition to vermonts bill was from a 
representative of general motors mccormack said legislators were 
told that alternative coolants being developed by dupont were not 
as efficient as the those now available and that new coolants will 
require development of compatible lubricants and seals 
car dealers didnt oppose it our stand was really pretty 
neutral said charles ffolliott the vermont representative of 
the national automotive dealers association 
he estimated that more than half of the new cars sold in vermont 
are equipped with air conditioning nationally roughly 90 percent 
of all new cars have airconditioning 
mccormack acknowleged that relatively low temperatures in 
vermont make the prospects of a summer without an airconditioned 
car more palatable than in some states vermonts average high 
temperature in july is only 70 degrees farenheit 
he also said detroit lobbyists never specifically said they 
couldnt produce cfcfree air conditioners by 1993 
the bill won widespread support from vermonts legislators 
vermont legislators who support this legislation were very 
sincere when they said we were willing to do without air 
conditioning in our cars said mulhern 
the international montreal protocol signed in 1987 called for 
halving cfc emissions by 1999 
but at a meeting in finland last week attended by delegates 
from 81 countries scientists said ozone depletion is proceeding 
more rapidly than was previously believed 
the amount of cfcs produced by vermont is minuscule but to 
the extent this helps to light the way this could be a very 
important breakthrough said state sen stephen reynes

8208 million in the same period of 1988 
earnings for the fourth quarter of 1988 included an

86 cents a share down 38 percent from 1281 million or 138 a 
share for the fiscal year ended march 31 1988 the statement said

because of a onetime charge involving the pending 440 million 
acquisition of scherer by shearson lehman hutton holdings inc 
sales for the 1989 fiscal year totaled 35059 million up 21 
percent from 29074 million in the same period a year earlier

cnw corp and its suitor japonica partners lp 
sparred tuesday over japonicas request that the transportation 
company postpone its annual meeting scheduled for next week 
meanwhile representatives from both sides testified in 
washington before the interstate commerce commission which wants 
to know more about japonicas financing and plans for chicagobased 
cnw a railroad holding company 
japonica a new york investment group headed by paul kazarian 
released a statement tuesday saying it was evaluating its options 
after cnw rejected a proposal to postpone its scheduled may 16 
annual meeting and board election for 30 days 
japonica said it sought the delay to give cnw shareholders more 
time to fully assess the companys progress toward increasing the 
value of its stock 
japonica said its proposal included an offer to lock in for 
30 days its takeover bid of 44 a share or 658 million for all 
the cnw stock that japonica doesnt already own the partnership is 
cnws largest shareholder with an 88 percent stake in the firm 
cnw said in a statement issued later tuesday it would not 
postpone its annual meeting becase japonicas ability to purchase 
the company is not affected by the timing of the annual meeting 
at that meeting shareholders will vote by proxy on whether to 
replace the companys board of directors with a slate of japonica 
nominees 
cnw which owns the chicago and north western railroad a major 
freight hauler in the midwest is seeking friendly buyout offers 
from other companies in an effort to defeat japonicas hostile bid 
chairman robert schmiege said tuesday in washington the company 
was examining one such bid and that more than two other companies 
had also expressed interest in cnw 
icc chairwoman heather j gradison gave japonica until the close 
of business wednesday to provide information about how it plans to 
finance a takeover of cnw or face a subpoena 
japonica representative howard hardesty told the commission his 
company would consider the icc order but he said japonica doesnt 
want to aid and abet other companies working on competing bids to 
take over the railroad 
cnw provides freight service from chicago to south dakota iowa 
minnesota wisconsin nebraska wyoming and missouri it also has a 
profitable franchise to carry coal from wyoming to montana which 
company officials say is one of the operations that has made it 
attractive to takeover bids
