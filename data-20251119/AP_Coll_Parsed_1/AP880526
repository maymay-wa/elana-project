striking tv and movie scriptwriters claimed 
they had split management ranks thursday after 64 producers 
including the makers of the cosby show and johnny carsons talk 
show signed independent contracts with the writers union 
several of the firms that signed with the writers guild of 
america produce successful television programs for nbc 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
representing the industrys biggest producers downplayed the 
signings which represent a significant break in the 12week strike 
the walkout has forced delays in the start of the fall 
television season and reruns of such shows as late night with 
david letterman and the tonight show starring johnny carson 
the 9000member writers guild of america was scheduled to vote 
thursday night in new york and los angeles on contracts with 
smaller socalled independent producers 
voting results wouldnt be known until friday said union 
spokeswoman cheryl rhoden in los angeles 
were anticipating ratification ms rhoden said we see 
it strategically as a good move at this time to break the logjam 
with the alliance 
ms rhoden released the names of the independent producers and 
the terms of their threeyear contract with the wga before members 
gathered to vote on the proposal the contract includes increases 
in foreign residual payments and provides writers with greater 
creative input 
the list of 64 production companies includes the carseywerner 
company which produces two of the most popular shows on 
television the cosby show and a different world 
the makers of tonight signed a contract and the producers of 
late night have agreed to a contract but havent signed said 
union president george kirgo others signing were producers of 
alf and the muppets 
also on the list are michael landon productions which makes 
highway to heaven and you and me kid productions the maker of 
the nowcancelled the days and nights of molly dodd 
most of the producers appear to be film companies such as the 
gaby film group inc and some such as paul keyes productions 
produce tv specials 
none of the 217 big producers who belong to the alliance have 
signed independent contracts management spokesman herb steinberg 
said thursday 
the large producers whose ranks include such bigtime 
moviemakers as columbia pictures and such tv giants as mtm and 
lorimar employ 80 percent of the industrys writers and supply 84 
percent of primetime tv he noted 
the alliance producers are holding strong steinberg said 
this is all very very interesting but it has no impact on 
the new season or on the contract negotiations steinberg said 
what theyre talking about makes no change in the point of 
conflict which are the deficits for productions of onehour 
primetime tv shows and the depressed market for those shows in 
syndication 
nearly 180 producers had discussed independent agreements which 
meet the writers demands on residual payments they receive when 
shows are rerun and for consultation on script changes made during 
filming she said 
those are the main points of contention in the strike which 
began march 7 
on monday both sides sat down with a federal mediator for the 
first time since april 8 the talks at alliance headquarters in the 
los angeles suburb of sherman oaks failed to produce agreement on 
any issue 
negotiators agreed to meet in small groups saturday and set 
another full bargaining session tuesday

gen manuel antonio noriega said 
thursday that talks with the united states about his future broke 
down when the us envoy presented him with an ultimatum that the 
us terms be accepted immediately 
noriega speaking to a cheering crowd that packed the 500seat 
national assembly accused the united states of political 
economic and military aggression against panama 
the world must know that the conversation sustained with the 
envoy of president reagan broke down when he presented us with an 
ultimatum in which panama had to immediately accept his last 
offer said noriega who as head of the 15000member military is 
the de facto leader of the country 
i know it and i say so because i was there us secretary of 
state george shultz wasnt there he told the crowd hundreds 
more listened outside near a loudspeaker 
the general did not elaborate he said panama had accepted 
several us proposals but added even this wasnt sufficient 
the united states desired an ultimatum 
in guatemala city president vinicio cerezo arevalo offered 
thursday to act as mediator between the two countries he told 
reporters panama was experiencing a radicalization against the 
united states that is dangerous for the region and that moreover is 
causing grave damage to the panamanian nation 
the guatemalan chief executive said he had spoken with us and 
panamanian officials on the issue he did not identify them 
cerezo met thursday with james michel the us ambassador to 
guatemala 
noriega appeared in the national assembly to answer questions 
about what the government insists were conversations not 
negotiations on a possible arrangement under which he would leave 
power 
the speech was attended by 39 of the assemblys 67 members 
those absent included the 20 representatives of opposition parties 
noriega said panama had become a pawn for candidates in the us 
political campaign 
they are using the flag of panama in whatever way is 
convenient for them and some candidates want to bury files that 
weigh on their shoulders said noriega who commands panamas 
military and police he did not identify them 
noriega repeated his conditions for leaving power extra troops 
sent to us bases in panama must be withdrawn and the position of 
manuel solis palma whom he installed as president must be 
guaranteed 
he said the united states must respect panama 
i refer the north american people and their candidates who are 
using the flag of panama to win votes to the words of one of their 
philosophers thomas jefferson when he said the politician thinks 
of the next elections the statesman of the next generations the 
general said 
referring to the panama canal treaties of 1977 noriega said 
the united states has mocked what has been signed it has mocked 
the signing of the torrijoscarter treaties gen omar torrijos 
noriegas predecessor and mentor reached the accord with president 
jimmy carter 
washington wants noriega who is under us indictment on drug 
charges to leave the country and eric arturo delvalle to return as 
president in exchange for lifting economic sanctions and possibly 
dropping the drug charges 
noriega dismissed delvalle on feb 26 the day after delvalle 
had tried to fire the general as commander of the panama defense 
forces 
solis palma told a womens organization earlier thursday that 
american negotiators told noriega in march to be out of the country 
within 48 hours or face the consequences after noriega refused he 
said the americans softened their manner 
he said talks failed because the united states would not promise 
to keep him on as president or to help with panamas economic 
crisis which stems partly from the us sanctions 
the final deal would have dropped the drug charges in return for 
noriega giving up command of the armed forces aug 12 and leaving 
the country in september solis palma said but added 
when we talked to them about the need for them to give 
guarantees and proofs that they would look for ways to recover in 
part the economic damage caused to the republic of panama they came 
back with promises but never followed through 
according to solis palma the united states would promise to 
release 50 million in panamanian assets frozen in american banks 
only if he chose a national unity cabinet that in turn would pick a 
president who could not be solis palma 
ricardo arias calderon president of the opposition christian 
democrats said thursday the negotiations failed because of a 
growing division in the military and the united states should have 
been aware of it 
errors by the united states were not the only factor although 
they were a factor he said

vice president george bush lashed out wednesday at political 
liberals accusing them of destroying a bipartisan consensus toward 
the soviet union while democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis said bushs advocacy of the death penalty for drug 
dealers was the height of hypocrisy 
during a onehour debate in san francisco jesse jackson pressed 
his democratic rival for specific budget details as well as on his 
policy toward south africa but the two democrats saved their 
strongest comments for criticism of the reagan administration for 
its dealings with panamanian military leader manuel antonio noriega 
after the debate jackson and dukakis met privately 
with president reagan en route to a moscow summit the two 
democrats said they hoped the superpowers would move toward less 
reliance on military solutions to world problems 
dukakis said the superpowers were wandering around the world 
like lonesome cowboys intervening militarily 
jackson said he wished reagan godspeed and a good astrologist 
as he believes in both and added he hoped the superpowers would 
look beyond the arms race 
the debate their first in more than a month took place only 
hours after secretary of state george p shultz announced the 
failure of negotiations aimed at getting noriega to relinquish 
power in panama shultz said no new talks were scheduled 
bush said the fact the negotiations had broken down doesnt 
depress me 
im convinced noriega will be out of power bush told 
reporters in lakehurst nj well have to go back and figure it 
out 
bush has advocated the death penalty for drug kingpins 
when jackson was asked if he supported that position he 
replied i do not i do not think we have the moral authority to 
execute in that sense we have the obligation to take them off the 
streets and above all do not deal with them and give them 
sanctuary and put them on the cia payroll 
dukakis then interjected its the height of hypocrisy for 
people in the administration to be advocating the death penalty for 
drug pushers while they are doing business with noriega and 
funneling aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers 
i dont know of anything phonier than that kind of policy 
questioned about his opposition to the death penalty dukakis 
said you dont have to be for the death penalty to be tough on 
crime 
he said views on the death penalty would not be a standard for 
judges he would appoint as president 
i dont apply ideological litmus tests he said 
dukakis said trying to forumlate a detailed budget plan so far 
in advance would be a serious mistake 
jackson kept pressing him however saying that the governor 
is laying out a budget of prommises but not a budget of numbers 
when jackson asked dukakis if he would use military force 
against south africa the massachusetts governor replied that he 
would press for more effective sanctions 
when jackson kept pressing him dukakis said yes one aspect 
of a tough antiterrorist policy is the use of military force 
against terrorist base camps but there are many ways to attack 
terrorism 
the massachusetts governor expects to lock up the democratic 
presidential nomination on june 7 when california new jersey 
montana and new mexico hold primaries the last major contests of 
the long preconvention campaign 
during a stop at the us capitol before he flew west dukakis 
picked up endorsements from 18 members of congress who will be 
super delegates to the democratic national convention in july 
bush at west point ny told cadets at the us military 
academy commencement ceremony that the liberal elite had 
abandoned what he called the bipartisan consensus for maintaining a 
strong national defense aides billed the bush speech as 
nonpolitical 
standing under a small canopy in the pouring rain bush never 
mentioned dukakis or jackson but left no doubt of his targets 
im sure theyd claim it isnt so and theyre all in favor of 
a strong defense bush said they look the part sober and 
measured in their gray suits moving their hands on the sunday talk 
shows with just the right amount of gravity and earnestness 
but what are we to think when they say theyre for a strong 
defense but they oppose every new weapons system that would 
preserve that strength bush asked 
bush spoke only hours after president reagan departed for europe 
and a superpower summit in moscow 
he cautioned against allowing summit meetings to lead toward 
complacency toward the soviets 
we must be confident that those who will lead our country 
understand what it means to stand up to a challenge and meet our 
commitments bush said we must be confident that they will 
pursue negotiations with the soviets realistically 
he said that under democratic presidents harry truman and john 
f kennedy and then under republican president dwight d eisenhower 
there was bipartisan agreement on the need to deal with the soviets 
from a position of strength 
there are some today who have abandoned those principles he 
said the liberal elite do not understand they never understood 
the common sense behind the consensus 
later the vice president called for the naming of an 
independent counsel to study recent alleged financial irregularties 
surrounding house speaker jim wright 
if they want to talk about attorney general edwin ed meese 
how about talking about the speaker he said meeses legal 
problems have been frequently raised by the democrats 
while in washington dukakis met with a former rival democratic 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee a private meeting he later 
described as very cordial 
they met in dukakis hotel room and gore still withheld any 
endorsement of the apparent nominee the senator wrote to his 
delegates last week and urged them to stay loyal for the time 
being gore has nearly 400 delegates 
the 18 congressional delegates dukakis picked up moved his total 
to nearly 1700 he needs 2081 for a convention majority 
jackson has less than 1000 in the latest associated press 
survey 
during meetings at the capitol dukakis said we are not going 
to concede one single state to the republicans in the fall 
one of his sessions was with western members of congress and he 
said the strategy is to win the west he said it was one of 
the great political paradoxes that while democrats run well in 
the region in contests for congress governor and other offices 
the partys candidates have been virtually shut out there in recent 
presidential elections the last democratic presidential candidate 
to carry the west was lyndon b johnson in 1964

after a boldly existential ending st 
elsewhere exists no more 
the show which won a dozen emmy awards concluded wednesday 
night with a surprise conclusion revealing the entire six years of 
the critically acclaimed series as the fantasy of an autistic child 
weve had the ending for a number of years said bruce 
paltrow one of the shows executive producers 
we were looking for the metaphor for all of us to have created 
this fiction to place the entire six years into the imagination of 
boy who could not communicate with the outside world but had this 
staggeringly exciting inner life was we thought an excitingly 
existential end to the series 
when it made its debut six season ago st elsewhere was 
part of a wave of creativity from mtm productions that 
revolutionized stodgy network programming in the 1980s st 
elsewhere followed hill street blues onto nbc and was 
inevitably compared to the earlier shows groundbreaking style 
overlapping dialogue and handheld cameras 
but st elsewhere went beyond hill street in social 
satire at times serious at times hilarious it took on politics 
religion aids heterosexual and homosexual rape cancer drug 
abuse the afterlife corporate indifference its own network and 
previous shows from mtm one entire episode revolved around a male 
patients insistence that he was mary richards from the mary 
tyler moore show 
the st elsewhere writers had wanted to go all out in the 
final episode but prohibitive costs kept their script a 
futuristic view of st eligius at the edge of apocalypse from 
being filmed 
in the end prohibitive costs knocked down not only the intended 
final episode but the show itself st elsewhere was produced 
at a loss by mtm at a time when hourlong series are not selling 
well in syndication 
the show will be seen in reruns but mtm will not release 
details of its syndication sales 
in an apparently personal inside joke in the dialogue of the 
final script dr wayne fiscus howie mandel says of his years at 
st eligius grueling hours bad food egomania death and moral 
confusion itll be hard to leave 
the producers of the show have long since left and are busy on a 
new series for nbc tattingers an offbeat romantic comedy set 
in a popular new york restaurant it is being shot on location here 
and stars stephen collins blythe danner and jerry stiller the 
show is on nbcs fall schedule in the time period that st

massachusetts senate republicans locked themselves 
in a room in protest wednesday night as democratic senators adopted 
two tax increase measures totaling more than 100 million 
the senate quickly approved a 70 million income tax loophole 
closing measure and a 5 percent sales tax on cigarettes designed to 
raise nearly 40 million and sent the measures to the house as the 
vote took place six senate republicans sat in a locked room with 
the telephones either in use or off the hook 
the republicans said they were caucusing and were hoping to 
delay action on the tax increase proposals while at the same time 
drawing media attention to the tax bills the senate with many 
democrats also absent from the chamber approved the bills on a 
voice vote 
for a 100 million bill to go through the massachusetts senate 
without a roll call is outrageous said sen david locke who led 
the republican caucus 
locke and fellow sen paul cellucci are top officials in vice 
president george bushs massachusetts presidential campaign 
gov michael s dukakis the likely democratic presidential 
nominee has called for additional revenue and spending cuts to 
balance the 118 billion state budget but has maintained it can 
be done without raising cigarette taxes 
he has campaigned for president in part on his ability to 
balance the states budget and on his success in reducing taxes 
over the past six years 
senate president william bulger derided the republicans move as 
a publicity stunt 
the minority party was well aware of whats been going on 
bulger said he said that after several attempts to call the 
republicans failed a court officer knocked on the door and 
informed the republicans that a vote was taking place 
two of the eight republicans in the 40member massachusetts 
senate were absent

the greatest show on earth will venture 
across the pacific for the first time as ringling bros and barnum 
amp bailey circus goes on tour in japan circus officials announced 
wednesday 
the 175 artists with the circus will be performing under a tent 
for the first time in three decades for practical reasons said 
kenneth feldman owner president and producer of the circus 
you could never fit an elephant in the doors of most 
japanese arenas built mainly for sumo wrestling he said 
since 1956 the circus has performed in indoor arenas on its 
us tours 
i would never go if i couldnt keep the same standards i have 
in this country feld said 
those standards include the star attraction an animal billed as 
a living unicorn animal rights organizations say the circus 
animal is a goat with a bull horn surgically implanted in its head 
the 16week engagement will start july 3 in sapporo and include 
a sevenweek run in downtown tokyo with performances in osaka the 
tour is the first far east engagement in the 118year history of 
the circus

a supercharged motorcycle the carrillo brothers highwire artists

ninetyfive trucks will carry the circus from city to city 
feld was to announce details of the tour thursday in washington 
where the circus has its corporate headquarters winter 
headquarters are in venice 
feld said the japanese people have more leisure time since 
switching from a sixday work week to a fiveday work week 
i expect receptions like we get in every city in the united 
states where children of all ages are thrilled he said 
organizing the massive transportation project with contingents 
of elephants horses and camels was an undertaking twice the size 
of what feld had anticipated but was worth the effort 
i wouldnt have done it if i didnt love it he said 
the domestic tour of 85 us cities by two other circus units 
will be unaffected by the japanese engagements

ten years after atlantic city started 
its gamble with legalized gaming it has won a giant new industry 
but lost its innocence 
even skeptics wont deny the resort has seen a dramatic economic 
turnaround since the first casino opened may 26 1978 and turned 
the island into the most visited tourist destination in the united 
states 
the casinos provide yearround jobs tax benefits for the 
states elderly and disabled and a percentage of gaming revenues 
for rebuilding atlantic city neighborhoods 
but even the most optimistic observer can find flaws in how the 
experiment turned out particularly in the deteriorated 
neighborhoods and shuttered shop windows just steps from the casino 
hotel lobbies 
before 1978 the saying was the last one to cross the bridge 
turns out the lights recalls atlantic city police chief joseph 
pasquale the city was dying 
then in a honkytonk burst of flashing lights and ringing 
bells atlantic city was reborn hundreds of buses and cars now 
squeeze down narrow streets each day bigname entertainers are 
returning to the showrooms and convention hall throbs with trade 
shows heavyweight fights and other extravaganzas 
h steven norton executive vice president of resorts 
international casino hotel recalls the exhilarating rush when 
his casino opened as the citys first legal gaming hall thousands 
of people lined up outside waiting for a chance to drop quarters 
into slot machines and slap bills onto green felt 
last year atlantic city reported more than 28 billion in 
gaming revenues and more than 30 million visitors 
twelve casino hotels tower over the citys boardwalk and the 
oncebarren marina section the new jersey gaming industry is the 
focus of highstakes wall street business deals and with more than 
40000 casino employees unemployment in the region has declined to 
record lows 
yet many tourists cluck in dismay at the decaying houses that 
still line the citys streets thoroughfares made famous by the 
monopoly game board 
the crime rate also causes concern in 1976 the committee to 
rebuild atlantic city promised that casino gaming would reduce 
violent crime in the resort 
murders rapes assaults and armed robberies actually increased 
from 103 per 1000 residents in 1977 to a high of 32 in 1981 but 
when adjusted to account for the millions of visitors and thousands 
of nonresident employees the figures settle down to an overall 
reduced rate 
state gaming regulators beam with pride at having kept the 
casinos relatively free of organized crimes corruption although 
some critics feel they wield too much control over the city others 
suggest atlantic city needs more control specifically a regional 
or state authority to run city government the current power 
struggle among state county and local officials has delayed two 
important projects a proposed new convention center and a larger 
airport 
the city itself has not redeveloped as quickly as everyone 
hoped said casino control commissioner valerie armstrong 
there was a great deal of optimism in 1976 when the referendum 
passed that things would move quickly but its disappointing to 
see what is potentially a beautiful city not go anywhere 
atlantic city was languishing the victim of broadening travel 
horizons made possible by cheaper airfares when the notion of 
legalized gaming surfaced as a way to rebuild a referendum to 
legalize gambling statewide failed in 1974 a second ballot 
question limiting gaming to atlantic city was approved by new 
jersey voters nov 2 1976 
the casinos have generally found new jersey profitable but the 
city never revitalized enough to improve its appearance beyond the 
casinos 
while the suburbs are booming with shopping centers and housing 
developments atlantic city still has no movie theater that isnt 
pornographic and only one wellworn supermarket houses on prime 
waterfront lots are dilapidated owned mostly by speculators who 
hoped a decade ago and still hope to reap huge profits 
and what development has taken place has not pleased everyone 
the rev dudley sarfaty an original member of the casinos no 
dice antigambling group still believes that a lot of the 
local people gambling was supposed to save were driven away 
others want to preserve the old atlantic city of grand seaside 
hotels the miss america pageant boardwalk rolling chairs and 
ocean breezes 
the worst thing to happen to atlantic city was perhaps the 
failure to properly plan and protect the boardwalk frontage 
architecturally so there would have been something other than solid 
masonry walls said atlantic county historian adrian phillips 
in a similar vein former gov brendan byrne who ushered in 
casino gambling said atlantic city needs to focus more attention 
on becoming an overall resort instead of just a casino town 
atlantic city has contributed to the new exciting image of 
new jersey as a state thats not just a turnpike between new york 
and washington he said but atlantic city needs to become a 
fun place to visit even if youre not going to a casino 
ten years ago local business owners believed they would profit 
from the casinos next door most did not primarily because the 
casinos became selfcontained cities 
competitors in the wagering business argued that it wasnt 
safe for people to visit atlantic city said norton of resorts 
but we found that as long as you could provide a safe indoor 
environment we could create whatever atmosphere we wanted inside 
despite the competition some local businesses survived arnold 
orsatti a restaurateur said he discovered theres room for 
everybody 
there are too many people who think negatively he said 
were doing very well a lot of the big spenders would rather go 
outside of the casino than wait in line 
cora boggs president of the congress of community 
organizations recalled that too many people in atlantic city 
including myself were resentful for a long while of the casinos 
because we couldnt see anything else happening 
but now that funds from the casino reinvestment development

actress priscilla presley says shes incensed 
over reports that her exhusband elvis presley is alive and in 
seclusion 
such claims by supposedly reputable journalists she said 
are nonsense and harmful to herself and 20yearold daughter lisa 
marie elvis only child 
miss presley who was married to elvis from 1967 to 1972 said 
wednesday she was referring to kabctvs fourpart series called 
is elvis alive 
the report mentioned atlanta author gail giorgio whose book 
the most incredible elvis presley story ever told purports the 
king of rock n roll may still be swinging ms giorgio claims she 
has an audio tape of elvis speaking in 1980 
presley died in 1977 four years after priscilla presley 
divorced him 
it infuriates me that certain journalists have decided to 
exploit elvis presleys death merely for the sake of newspaper 
sales and higher ratings miss presley said 
the los angeles stations news director terry crofoot said 
it isnt kabcs claim that elvis is alive it would be ludicrous

the first mcdonalds to open in a 
communist country has run into an unexpected problem trained 
employees are quitting because they find they have to work like 
westerners and get paid like east europeans 
since the american fast food chain opened its outlet in belgrade 
in march 40 employees about onethird of its workers have 
voluntarily left their jobs despite a high unemployment rate in 
yugoslavia 
predrag dostanic managing director of the restaurant blames 
illusions about the west gleaned from american movies shown on 
yugoslav tv for the dropout rate 
that is all a result of a drastically incorrect concept about 
international businesses implanted in peoples minds by such 
american tv series as dynasty dostanic said 
those who have left us thought they would earn high wages only 
by virtue of working for an american enterprise said vesna 
milosevic an official of genex the yugoslav state enterprise that 
entered into a joint venture agreement with mcdonalds 
those young people who quit probably also expected they could 
do their jobs the yugoslav way relax at work but still receive 
wages dostanic added 
according to a recent domestic survey average yugoslavs work 
efficiently for only half of their eighthour workday the rest of 
the time is spent reading newspapers conducting private business 
or having interminable private chats with collegues over coffee 
the fastfood outlet located on a downtown square has drawn 
huge crowds since it opened march 23 to post a european record for 
mcdonalds restaurants by selling an average 6000 meals daily for 
the first month of operation 
the only other european branch matching the belgrade record is 
the mcdonalds in budapest hungary which opened a month after the 
yugoslav outlet 
with demand growing fast it is serving about 6000 people a 
day employees are so overworked that store manager agnes rapalics 
decided the only way to cope was to close at 8 pm three hours 
early 
her decision swiftly prompted moans from hungarians including a 
sour reader who wrote to the magyar hirlap newspaper asking does 
every wonder only last three days 
when the mcdonalds restaurant opened in belgrade police were 
called in to keep watch on the lines of customers snaking around 
the bloc and to limit the number of people entering the premises to 
avoid overcrowding 
the work was so hard that i could not stand it any more 
said a former employee who asked not to be identified if my 
salary was adequate to the work i might have stayed 
the restaurant employees mostly young people trained to work on 
counters and in the kitchen receive about 170 a month which is 
slightly above the yugoslav average 
we have no problem replacing those who have quit with new 
staff except that the newcomers have to get their training while 
doing their work said milosevic 
about 11 million people or about 15 percent of the work force 
are registered as unemployed in yugoslavia in belgrade alone 
about 80000 are looking for jobs 
maybe there is something good in all these unexpected staff 
problems said milosevic only the best workers will survive 
she added 
mcdonalds and genex contributed 1 million each for the 
flagship restaurant they also share the profits equally even 
though it is managed by yugoslavs 
the american corporation plans to open five more restaurants in 
yugoslavia in the next five years

images of michael jackson dancing to rock music in 
a pepsi commercial flicker across the soviet television screen and 
levis jeans hug the hips of young russians in a crowded subway car 
amerika as the soviets call it has arrived 
far behind the iron curtain we were able to develop a 
prowestern mentality and what tell me could be more western 
than america emigre author vasily aksyonov wrote about his youth 
in the soviet union of the 1950s 
even the cyrillic alphabet hasnt prevented what the russians 
call amerikanizatsia jeansi stop break dance ok 
and one of the latest signs of the times stress are now 
part of the russian lexicon 
soviet communist party general secretary mikhail gorbachev has 
encouraged his people to learn more about america to demonstrate 
his sincerity he has allowed more travel to the united states 
ended the jamming of voice of america broadcasts and removed 
barriers to joint business deals 
in april a record 1200 soviets most of them jews were 
allowed to visit relatives in the united states an additional 
1000 soviets traveled there on official business before 
gorbachev only a handful of soviets visited the united states 
monthly 
the 1985 geneva summit gave an official stamp of approval to 
cultural agreements and peopletopeople exchanges under the 
agreements soviet and american lawyers doctors students 
musicians scientists and teachers have visited each other 
in some instances the exchanges reflect a soviet desire for 
american help in tackling social problems such as alcoholism and 
drug addiction problems the government previously denied existed 
at the grassroots level soviets need little encouragement to 
talk about things american 
when introduced to an american many soviets immediately start 
with the questions on everything from war and peace to the 
availability of hamburgers 
a taxi drivers reaction when a passenger introduced himself as 
an american was to run down the american authors she loved ernest 
hemingway mark twain ray bradbury collections of these authors 
in translation occupy prominent places on the bookshelves in some 
soviet apartments more contemporary american authors are lesser 
known because their works still arent available in the soviet 
union 
levis jeans are required attire in certain circles and some of 
those who manage to get an american candy bar soft drink or pack 
of cigarettes proudly display the empty packaging in their living 
rooms 
many soviets are turning to videotapes for a glimpse of america 
tapes of movies such as police academy and rambo dubbed in 
russian are passed among friends in a thriving black market where 
blank cassettes cost at least 50 rubles 80 or one quarter of an 
average monthly salary 
the black market also feeds on young soviets thirst for 
american rock music records of madonna and michael jackson fetch 
exorbitant sums jacksons music videos have appeared on soviet 
television and his pepsi commercials hit the airwaves in midmay 
during broadcast of a fivepart series on the united states 
officially sponsored concerts by american musicians such as 
billy joel dave brubeck and the doobie brothers have become major 
happenings 
at the same time some soviet rock stars are traveling to the 
united states boris grebenshchikov the hippylike leader of the 
leningrad rock band aquarium is scheduled to record an album in 
the united states this summer 
the end of soviet jamming of voice of america broadcasts in may 
1987 opened a new source of information about life in the united 
states 
satellite television discussions with american studio audiences 
also have given soviets a chance to learn firsthand about life in 
the united states soviet televisions widely watched evening news 
program vremya has shown features on child care automobiles 
and sports in america and in midmay soviet television broadcast a 
series moderated by former us resident vladimir posner 
but even though soviet media coverage about the united states 
has become more balanced under gorbachev reports about crime 
unemployment racism and the poor are still common 
in politics americans and soviets still have sharp differences 
but for many of the soviets who viewed reagan as a warmonger a few 
years ago the rhetoric has eased since he signed an agreement with 
gorbachev last december to eliminate all mediumrange nuclear 
missiles 
we have no propaganda of hatred toward americans no 
disrespect of americans gorbachev told a group of us teachers 
of russian who met with him at the kremlin last august one 
cannot find them here either in politics or in teaching

its been more than 300 years since this 
town saw so much struggle over restraint but plimoth plantation 
visitors could soon be drinking beer and wine after a brief spell 
of temperance at the tourist spot 
for a while it looked like the prudish reputation of those 
early settlers had come back to haunt the village which offers a 
glimpse of 17th century life after plymouth rock but tuesday 
night after several gorounds the board of selectmen approved a 
limited liquor license for the plantation 
the board twice rejected requests for a license to serve all 
types of liquor yearround or for oneday licenses 
the license approved tuesday applies only from april to 
november when the plantation visitor center is open it still 
requires state approval 
the 41yearold private nonprofit tourist spot first served 
alcohol four years ago at a snack bar but that license was 
discontinued when the snack bar was torn down 
with the opening of a new visitors center and 200seat 
restaurant the plantation management hoped to draw more business 
by opening in the offhours for business conferences during which 
guests would expect alcohol on the menu 
in the past some residents objected that alcohol was not in 
keeping with the pilgrim spirit 
but in fact the pilgrims cooked with wine and regarded beer as 
more healthful than water plantation officials said 
however plantation spokeswoman sarah mann said most of the 
arguments against a comprehensive liquor license came from nearby 
restaurants and bars

the state senate agreed with the saying 
you cant take it with you and approved a bill that would 
allow elderly lottery winners to receive their jackpots sooner than 
younger winners 
the bill approved wednesday and sent to the assembly would allow 
jackpot winners older than age 65 to take their earnings in one 
lump sum or in periodic payments during their expected lifetime 
the usual 20year payoff on a lottery prize will not always 
result in a total benefit to the winner who is over 65 as he may 
not live to receive the full benefit said a memo on the bill 
the fact that the unpaid balance would be paid to his estate 
is of little consolation to many elderly winners who may wish to 
fully enjoy the fruits of their good fortune it said 
but john quinn director of the state lottery division said he 
opposes the bill because it would substantially reduce jackpots 
for example he said the jackpot up for grabs wednesday was 3 
million but i dont have 3 million to give them i have 14 
million the difference is interest money 
a winner currently would receive 21 annual payments of 114000 
after taxes said quinn if someone opted to take the prize in a 
14 million lump sum they would owe about 580000 in taxes he 
said 
quinn said he didnt believe any state lotteries offer the 
lumpsum option 
the average milliondollar lottery winner in new york is 49 
years old said quinn

if the white satellite dishes pointing west from 
the rossiya hotel past the kremlins ancient church domes didnt 
indicate something unusual was going on the new paint and pavement 
along vorovsky street might 
moscow is being inundated with american officials and western 
correspondents bringing the latest technology to cover president 
reagans fiveday visit beginning sunday 
and in ageold tradition officials are painting paving and 
otherwise sprucing up to ensure that reagan and those accompanying 
him get the best possible view of the soviet capital 
reagan left washington on wednesday for a threenight stopover 
in helsinki finland before flying to the soviet union for his 
summit with kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
he comes to moscow at a time when the city traditionally is 
trying to right itself after another long cold winter the truck 
traffic that roars along the garden ring road slows to a crawl as 
workers fill another spring crop of potholes and scaffolding goes 
up on buildings everywhere 
red tulips planted in squares and along boulevards are in bloom 
as are the lilacs bordering sidewalks and apartment buildings 
around the city stately chestnut trees are in bloom on the kremlin 
lawns the sun rises about 5 am and doesnt set until almost 10 
pm leaving a purple glow in the sky until almost midnight 
but this year the spring cleaning has taken on a particularly 
urgent air around several of the places reagan will visit 
the short street leading from the garden ring road to spaso 
house the us ambassadors residence where reagan will stay has 
been repaired for the first time in years pavement torn out months 
ago has been replaced and almost all the barricades that narrowed 
traffic for two blocks have been removed 
vorovsky street also is undergoing a major facelift nearly 
every building along the street from the writers union which 
reagan is scheduled to visit to the soviet supreme court building 
several blocks away appears to have been given a new coat of paint 
the foreign ministry press center where moscows most important 
press conferences are held has been undergoing repairs for weeks 
to improve the seats and the acoustics 
officials promised last week that it would be finished in time 
for the summit and a presummit news conference was held there 
this week when a reporter asked one of the speakers for a specific 
example of changes wrought by gorbachevs reforms however the 
microphones and armchair earphones installed for simultaneous 
translation suddenly failed forcing a premature end to the session 
the tass news agency said newspapers and magazines from around 
the world will be available at the press center next week not just 
the usual selection of papers from the soviet bloc 
at the us embassy some lastminute painting was going on and 
workers cleared out the courtyard in front of the empty chancery in 
the new redbrick compound the building has been the source of 
dispute between the united states and soviet union since us 
officials discovered that it was honeycombed with soviet listening 
devices it never has been put into use 
at stores soviet citizens said they had noticed no increases in 
supplies to cut down on the lines that gather in the streets one 
young woman joked that closer to reagans arrival maybe theyll 
even bring out sugar which has been in short supply in the 
capital and rationed elsewhere in the country because of 
moonshining hoarding and price increase 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said in an 
interview with the newspaper vechernaya moskva that about 3000 
foreign journalists are expected for the summit half from print 
media and half from radio and television 
gerasimov said the ministry of communications could not handle 
the demands of the western television companies so they wre 
permitted to bring in satellite dishes and other sophisticated 
equipment normally under strict government control 
the american television networks have crammed room after room of 
the mammoth rossiya hotel with shiny silver equipment cases 
preparing to broadcast their evening news programs from the soviet 
capital 
with some 5000 soviet and foreign journalists accredited to 
cover the event the summit press corps is the largest to gather 
here since the 1980 olympics soviet officials say 
moscow dissidents say they have noticed another similarity 
between the two events many deemed undesirable by the 
authorities were forced to leave town eight years ago they 
included prostitutes speculators and other criminals as well as 
dissidents 
father valery lapkovsky a russian orthodox priest from the 
crimean city of kerch arrived in moscow last friday and was told 
by authorities the next day to leave said russian orthodox 
activist alexander ogorodnikov 
lapkovsky was put into a mental hospital and diagnosed as 
schizophrenic in 1966 after approaching the us embassy with an 
appeal to thenpresident lyndon b johnson to help him leave the 
soviet union 
soviet officials also have set up roadblocks at the edge of the 
city to inspect automobiles the aim is to keep down the number of 
brokendown cars on the streets of moscow during the reagan visit

the president nearing the end of his eight 
years in office hoped to leave an arms accord as his final legacy 
after a summit meeting with the leader of the soviet union 
the soviet leader under attack by conservatives in his own 
country for reforms he was attempting responded sharply to what he 
described as confrontational statements from washington 
the year was 1960 the president was dwight d eisenhower the 
soviet leader was nikita s khrushchev 
the summit ended in failure 
there are some obvious differences between that summit and next 
weeks meeting between president reagan and kremlin leader mikhail 
s gorbachev in moscow 
what wrecked the 1960 summit or at least contributed to its 
collapse was the furor that arose after an american u2 spy plane 
was forced down in the soviet union and its pilot was captured 
there is nothing like that on the horizon now although the 
soviets are as adamant against reagans star wars missile defense 
system as they were against eisenhowers open skies plan to 
give the superpowers access to each others air space 
still the resemblances are haunting 
eisenhower hoping for a comprehensive ban on all nuclear 
testing told french president charles de gaulle what a splendid 
exit it would be for me to end up with an agreement between 
east and west reagan hopes for a pact by the end of his term to 
curb the intercontinental ballistic missiles that have flourished 
since eisenhowers day 
khrushchev who had unmasked the excesses of joseph stalin in 
his landmark secret speech was making modest economic and 
political reforms in the soviet union and urging dialogue with the 
united states similarly gorbachev has pushed his policies of 
glasnost or openness and perestroika or reconstruction 
my father was the first to shake the soviet bureaucratic 
society khrushchevs son sergei told the yugoslav daily 
vjesnik in an interview published this month i hope mikhail 
gorbachev succeeds where my father did not 
like khrushchevs the reforms initiated by gorbachev appear to 
have encountered resistance from the old guard in the kremlin 
both soviet leaders reacted sharply to statements by their us 
counterparts 
after eisenhower acknowledged the u2 flights khrushchev said 
the us president appeared to be boasting arrogantly about what 
the united states could do and would do and demonstrating that 
the americans didnt give a damn about anyone else that they 
would pursue only their selfish goals 
and when reagan accused the soviets of continued expansionism 
abroad and repression at home in a speech in springfield mass 
last month gorbachev responded we have so far been showing 
restraint but if we reciprocate and we can do so over a wide 
range of issues the atmosphere in sovietamerican relations can 
become such that it will make it no longer possible to solve any 
further issues 
some observers have interpreted gorbachevs remarks as a 
deliberate display of toughness designed for soviet as well as 
american audiences 
quite possibly there are people around him in moscow who dont 
like the many concessions he has made to the united states said 
vladimir petrov professor emeritus of international affairs at 
george washington university 
in 1960 too some suspected the soviet leaders blustering was 
an attempt to bolster his strength at home 
retired gen andrew goodpaster a top aide to eisenhower said 
i do recall that we thought at the time that he might just be 
vulnerable because of meeting with eisenhower and the favorable 
attitude he had toward eisenhower and this might have put him in 
some danger and put him under some pressure in the soviet union 
the arms control issue as well as the status of berlin had 
been on the agenda for a fourpower summit meeting the united 
states the soviet union britain and france in paris on may 16 
it broke up in disaster khrushchev pounding a table so hard he 
upset a bottle of mineral water denounced the u2 flights and 
the lackeys of imperialism 
he also withdrew his invitation to eisenhower to visit the 
soviet union the following month 
eisenhower disappointed in his hopes for an eastwest 
agreement later said he might have been lulled into 
overconfidence

investigators are trying to determine why two 
jetliners flying in opposite directions with 286 people on board 
were assigned the same altitude bringing them within 300 feet of 
colliding headon over the ocean north of puerto rico 
the federal aviation administration confirmed the monday evening 
incident which involved a pan american world airways airbus300 
and an american airlines boeing 727 
both pilots said in nearcollision reports that they had no time 
to take evasive action as the two aircraft passed wing tip to wing 
tip in clear weather about 550 miles north of puerto rico in the 
socalled bermuda triangle 
the triangle is a region in the atlantic ocean where ships and 
aircraft are reputed to have disappeared since the 1940s 
the jets both were believed to be cruising at better than 500 
miles an hour with a closing speed of more than 1000 miles an 
hour neither pilot reported seeing the aircraft until they were 
about to pass each other 
it is being investigated as a possible operational error by 
air traffic controllers faa spokesman fred farrar said wednesday 
when the incident was revealed he said he did not know whether the 
controllers involved have been removed from directing aircraft 
normally the case in such an incident 
in addition to the faa investigation the national 
transportation safety board has sent a team of investigators to 
puerto rico to talk to the controllers involved 
farrar confirmed that both of the jetliners were assigned to 
29000 feet and were under the control of the san juan air traffic 
control center at the time of the incident 
that section of airspace is beyond faa radar so separation is 
maintained by assigning specific altitudes normal separation would 
be at least 1000 feet vertically between aircraft and possibly 
more in some areas according to farrar 
he said that in oceanic airspace where there is no radar 
tracking planes there also is supposed to be substantial 
horizontal separation well beyond the fivemile minimum in 
radarcontrolled airspace 
these planes should not both have been at 29000 feet 
farrar said 
he said the two jetliners had about 300 feet horizontal 
separation and that both aircraft observed each other as they 
passed 
the incident involved pan am flight 217 which was southbound 
from new york to caracas venezuela with a later stop at trinidad 
the plane carried 131 passengers and 10 crew members according to 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
the other plane was american flight 902 which was northbound 
from san juan on a flight to philadelphia the boeing 727 carried 
138 passengers and seven crewmembers said john hotard a spokesman 
for american airlines 
we understand its an operational error by air traffic 
control its our understanding that both airplanes were assigned 
to 29000 feet said hotard in a telephone interview 
farrar said the faa is investigating who gave the planes their 
altitude both planes were under san juan air traffic controls 
direction he said 
another source who asked not to be identified by name said 
that the incident occurred near where control of planes switches 
from the faa center in new york to the san juan center and the 
handoff may have resulted in an altitude mixup 
the faas farrar said he could not confirm that 
investigators for the ntsb flew to san juan on wednesday to 
interview the controllers and may also speak later to the pilots 
involved said spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
we are investigating the incident were looking into it 
lopatkiewicz said

in the end it seemed almost everybody 
ranging from gen manuel antonio noriega to his severest us 
critics was saying the same thing about the administrations 
proposed deal for panama just say no 
vice president george bush opposed it along with 86 members of 
the senate ambassador juan b sosa a leader of the antinoriega 
forces here said the plan would enable the criminal empire 
noriega created to survive the temporary exile planned for him 
a disgruntled administration official was embittered by the 
terms the administration was offering for noriegas departure 
his mother could have written it he said 
noriega disagreed just when an agreement appeared to be within 
reach wednesday he could not bring himself to approve it 
critics of the plan are delighted but wednesdays drama 
bringing an end to almost a month of intense negotiations puts the 
united states and panama back to square one 
justice department officials who all along opposed the lifting 
of drug smuggling indictments against noriega are pleased with the 
outcome but there is virtually no prospect that noriega will ever 
be prosecuted 
the administration has withdrawn all its proposals from the 
bargaining table and is left with few ideas on what to do next 
beyond sounding out latin american democracies on their thoughts 
the negotiations ended almost three months to the hour after 
panamas crisis began with the failed attempt by president eric 
arturo delvalle to fire noriega 
delvalle who was fired himself the next day remains in hiding 
portraying himself as panamas legitimate president but without the 
means to exercise power and with little hope of being able to do so 
in 1903 when us power in the hemisphere was unquestioned 
president theodore roosevelt arranged for the secession of panama 
from colombia and for perpetual us control over 10mile wide 
canal zone those feats took all of two weeks 
while the united states was once able to get panama to leave 
colombia it now is unable to perform a task seemingly much 
simpler getting noriega to leave panama 
privately us officials describe the administrations central 
america policy as in a shambles coupled with the collapse of the 
panama negotiations is the prospect of disintegration of the 
nicaraguan contras and the consolidation of sandinista rule 
initially delvalles attempt to fire noriega seemed to offer 
the administration a rare opportunity panamas public opinion had 
galvanized against noriega a general strike against his rule was 
surprisingly successful and it seemed logical that a judicious 
display of us pressure would be enough to topple him 
to many the administration was in a position to strike a blow 
for democracy in panama and against an indicted drug dealer and to 
achieve a badly needed victory in central america after 
congressional rejection of more contra aid 
noriegas base of support seemed limited to a small coterie of 
allies in panamas defense forces and isolated segments of panamas 
peasantry 
but noriega proved to be extraordinarily resilient sensing 
correctly that as long as the defense forces remained loyal he 
stayed 
he was not about to give up nor about to repeat the humiliating 
surrender of his countryman roberto duran who scandalized 
panamanians in the seventh round of a 1980 fight with sugar ray 
leonard when he walked head down to his corner and said no 
mas 
shultz echoed the spirit of durans famous remark on wednesday 
although in a far different context when he discussed the collapse 
of the talks with noriega 
no further negotiations are contemplated shultz said all 
proposals addressed during these negotiations have been withdrawn 
no offers remain on the table

david letterman could get back on the air and 
johnny carson would have his writers back under agreements both 
have reached with the striking writers guild of america the 
unions president said wednesday as talks resumed in the 
12weekold strike 
carson whose tonight show resumed production this month 
when he began writing his own monologue has signed an independent 
contract and letterman whose late night is still in reruns 
has agreed to sign said guild president george kirgo 
kirgo said he was confident that the union membership would 
approve the threeyear pacts with the producers of the two shows 
guild members were scheduled to vote thursday night on the 
independent contracts which executive director brian walton said 
involved 39 companies as of wednesday afternoon 
the start of the fall television season could hang in the 
balance as the striking scriptwriters and producers conduct 
lastchance talks the strike began march 7 
walton and the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers said the producers presented several proposals wednesday 
and while the union left some open for discussion it immediately 
rejected a new payment structure for onehour primetime television 
shows sold into syndication 
the formula would drop a fixed payment schedule and reward 
writers based on a shows success in syndication 
earlier wednesday letterman issued a tongueincheek statement 
through nbc saying his manager and lawyer and us attorney 
general ed meese were negotiating with the guild apparently 
seriously though he said he hoped to be back on the air with his 
writers back at their jobs as early as june 8 in the meantime 
i am keeping busy with my gardening and phoning my favorite 
talkradio programs he joked in the statement last month i 
splurged and treated myself to muchneeded liposuction surgery on 
my hips and thighs 
i talked to david last week said kirgo hes waiting he 
will not go back to work without his writers we had a long and 
terrific talk 
nearly 100 negotiators attorneys and onlookers for the striking 
writers guild of america and the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers were on hand at the alliances sherman oaks 
headquarters for the second mediated session in three days 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg said there had been some new 
thinking as a result of mondays meeting with a mediator asked 
what areas the new thinking included steinberg replied the key 
issues 
kirgo did not share steinbergs enthusiasm over a possible break 
in the deadlock we were here eight hours monday and nothing 
happened he said 
producers are preparing to begin important talks june 15 with 
the hollywood craft unions and teamsters whose contracts expire 
july 31 
if writers are still negotiating by then talks would have to be 
scheduled around the other unions talks 
both sides have suffered from the walkout over creative control 
on the set and residual payments for both onehour syndicated 
television show reruns and works distributed in foreign countries

six radical leftists complained in lengthy 
speeches about tight security and harsh jail conditions as they 
were arraigned on charges of setting off a bomb in the the us 
capitol five years ago 
the security concerns have totally subordinated our legal 
rights and our human rights defendant alan berkman said 
wednesday 
berkman a physician who already is serving 12 years for illegal 
possession of explosives and weapons then referred to the wall of 
bulletproof plastic that separated the court from spectators and 
said there is no legitimate security concern to account for that 
plexiglas screen in the courtoom 
lead defense counsel susan tipograph complained that the 
defendants had been unable to meet privately with lawyers to confer 
about the case she also said that the defendants were forced to 
wear handcuffs and leg irons while meeting with lawyers 
she refused to discuss a schedule for pretrial motions until the 
defendants had a chance to meet and discuss hiring permanent 
lawyers for the case 
us district judge harold h greene said that he would make 
sure the defendants were allowed to meet together and confer 
without being overheard by jail guards 
but greene said he would not interfere with other security 
precautions taken against the defendants who were already in 
custody on other charges before the indictment was unsealed on may 
11 
the judge who gave the defendants 30 days to hire lawyers 
expressed frustration with the lengthy speeches 
were not going to have a mass meeting greene said if 
you want to give vent to your exasperation i cant help that 
at one point greene said im getting sick of this 
each of the six defendants pleaded innocent to the charges 
identifying themselves as antiimperialist political prisoners 
marilyn buck linda sue evans and laura whitehorn are charged 
with conspiring to set off bombs in the capitol and seven other 
locations in new york city and washington as part of a campaign of 
armed propaganda against us foreign policy 
they are charged along with berkman timothy blunk susan 
rosenberg and elizabeth duke a fugitive with malicious 
destruction of property in connection with the bombings at the 
capitol and three military buildings in washington in 1983 and 1984 
none of the blasts caused any injuries 
the nov 7 1983 explosion outside the senate chamber blew the 
doors off hinges outside the offices of senate democratic leader 
robert byrd of west virginia damaged five paintings and knocked 
down a wall 
i am a political prisoner not a terrorist said buck 40 
who faces a life sentence following her conviction in new york 
earlier this month of participating in two 1981 brinks armored car 
robberies that left four people dead 
the indictment charges that the defendants are members of a 
secret communist organization that plotted to oppose obstruct or 
change the foreign and domestic policies of the us government 
through violent and illegal means 
five of the six defendants in court wednesday already are 
serving sentences for various federal weapons charges whitehorn 
recently completed a twoyear term for making a false statement on 
a passport application she is in custody awaiting trial in 
baltimore on federal weapons charges 
greene ordered her held without bail after assistant us 
attorney margaret ellen described how whitehorn hit an fbi agent 
while resisting arrest in baltimore in 1985 
outside the us courthouse relatives of the defendants issued 
a statement accusing the goverment of trying to silence dissent 
the justice department and the fbi are making a spectacle of this 
case to show what the government will do if you dare to oppose 
it the group said in a statement 
dr barbara zeller berkmans wife said the courtroom security 
was an enormous show of power of the us government they are 
trying to intimidate serious dissent they are trying to intimidate 
the defendants 
bella rosenberg said that she was shocked to learn that her 
daughter was being held in a psychiatric observation unit at the 
district of columbia jail 
there has never been any question about her mental or 
emotional stability mrs rosenberg said she has always been a 
model prisoner 
susan rosenberg 32 and blunk 30 are serving 58year 
sentences for possession of 600 pounds of explosives found when 
they were arrested in cherry hill nj nearly three years ago 
the indictment charged that after each bombing the defendants 
claimed credit for the blasts under the names of various groups 
such as the armed resistance unit the revolutionary fighting group 
and the red guerrilla resistance 
the groups also claimed responsibility for bombs set off at four 
locations in new york city between 1983 and 1985 the indictment 
charged 
the blasts were set to protest various us foreign policies 
toward the middle east and central america

a catastrophic health insurance bill providing 
the largest expansion of medicare in the programs 23year history 
has cleared a major legislative hurdle 
the compromise agreed to late wednesday by a housesenate 
conference committee must win final approval from both chambers 
but that is a foregone conclusion given the broad support that the 
basic measure received last year when it cleared the two houses in 
different versions 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen told 
conference committee members that he will recommend that president 
reagan sign the legislation even though it is considerably more 
ambitious than the measure proposed by the administration more than 
a year ago 
the basic framework of the legislation has been in place for 
months providing protection for americas 31 million medicare 
recipients against runaway hospital and prescription drug bills 
accumulated during acute illnesses but house and senate 
negotiators have worked since february to iron out the details 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas whose finance committee shaped the 
senate bill called the compromise a landmark piece of 
legislation that will bring peace of mind to millions 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee as well as the conference committee praised bowen 
for his protracted role in overcoming some objections within the 
administration to win presidential support for the medicare 
expansion 
you are the linchpin who launched us on this crusade 
rostenkowski told bowen a physician and former twoterm governor 
of indiana whose first wife died after a long battle against cancer 
bowen made catastrophic health legislation his top priority when 
he was appointed to head the health and human services department a 
little more than two years ago and was there when the final 
compromise was struck 
in fact it was a surprise bowen maneuver dropping his 
opposition to a respite care provision for homebound beneficaries 
that removed the last stumbling block to compromise 
bentsen couldnt believe his ears when bowen offered the 
compromise 
thats a hell of a deal the texan exclaimed later he told 
bowen youre timing was excellent you are a great negotiator 
the big knot that had kept the legislation tied up was loosened 
last week when a conference committee task force agreed on 
provisions of a historic outpatient prescription drug benefit 
the compromise legislation provides for medicare coverage for 
hospital stays lasting up to 364 days a firstday deductible still 
will be charged medicare now pays full hospital bills for only 59 
days a year 
regarding doctor bills medicare now pays no more than 80 
percent of approved charges no matter how high they run under the 
catastrophic health provision medicare will pay 100 percent of 
allowable fees after an individual has incurred 1320 to 1400 in 
outofpocket expenses 
the exact level of that deductible has yet to be determined 
along with several other details such as the precise additional 
premiums that will be assessed to pay for the new program 
as for prescription drugs medicare now covers just a handful of 
particularly expensive drugs such as antirejection medication for 
organ transplant patients 
under the expansion medicare will pay half of drug costs in 
1991 after a 600 deductible is met with the government share 
rising to 60 percent in 1992 and 80 percent in 1993 however the 
deductible is expected to rise each year to keep pace with rising 
drug costs 
the drug benefit and all other additional benefits are to be 
paid for by additional charges to medicare enrollees the charges 
will be a blend of flat monthly premium increases deducted from 
social security checks and an additional slidingscale 
supplemental premium that will be charged to the estimated 40 
percent of the elderly with enough income to make them subject to 
federal income taxes 
while the exact premiums have not yet been determined the 
additional flat premium will start at about 4 a month in 1989 
climbing to 1020 in 1993 
the socalled supplemental premium is expected to total an 
additional 22 a year for each 150 of income tax owed in 1989 
climbing to an additional 42 a year on each 150 of tax liability 
by 1993 
in addition to the main provisions the bill would add medicare 
benefits to hospice care and skilled nursing care it also makes 
changes in medicaid to prevent the impoverishment of a spouse when 
his or her mate must go into a nursing home it also will require 
state medicaid programs to pay all medicare premiums and 
deductibles for elderly and disabled people with incomes below the 
poverty line

charles scott has been through two wars several 
jobs and a lot of ups and downsnow he said im 57 and i feel 
like im 27 
scott is about to graduate from the vietnam veterans leadership 
program which was started by the kind of veterans rarely heard 
from welladjusted welloff and relatively untroubled by their 
war experience 
its successful vets helping vets who havent quite made it in 
the mainstream said the programs 44yearold president and 
cofounder gene gitelson who led an infantry platoon in vietnam 
in 1966 and 1967 as an army first lieutenant 
among its founders board members and staffers are lawyers 
investment bankers and executives of every pinstripe the chairman 
of the board doug greenlaw earned a silver star in vietnam and is 
an executive with mtv 
gitelson a former banker and management consultant started the 
program six years ago in his apartment 
we kept each other alive in vietnam with this enormous buddy 
network and now 20 years later were rebuilding a network and 
helping each other in an economic war to get into the 
mainstream he said 
today in a ceremony at vietnam veterans plaza here the 
nonprofit group is celebrating its move to a 10000squarefoot 
office courtesy of drexel burnham lambert inc and the donation 
of 100000 worth of computer equipment from ibm 
about 750 veterans have been placed in jobs through the program 
which is a pilot for similiar efforts in other cities gitelson 
said 
gitelson heads a staff of 24 most of them vietnam vets and many 
who have gone through the program a placement director for 
instance used to be homeless living behind an elevator shaft in 
the south bronx 
we believe the experience of serving in combat gave people 
skills abilities and values that are transferable to the 
mainstream life gitelson said 
the 57yearold scott of brooklyn was in the air force during 
the korean war and an army platoon sergeant in vietnam in 1968 and 
1969 after 12 years with the new york army national guard he 
started his own business a parking garage but was forced to give 
it up when the rent went too high 
welfare and parttime work came next and then he saw a 
television ad for the program 
it was one of the best things i ever did he said they 
dont give you a job but they prepare you for a job 
the first stage called basic training involves tests of 
skills intellect and personality that determine what kind of job 
the vet is best suited for 
psychological and medical testing gitelson said have uncovered 
brain injuries no one ever treated before group discussions 
classroom work and counseling lead to instruction in how to prepare 
resumes and handle job interviews 
gitelson said 60 percent of the participants had been unemployed 
for six to nine months when they entered the program 50 percent 
were transients 
were not talking about the easy guys he said but 
theyre wonderful guys with talent who have somehow fallen on 
deaf ears 
the jobs they find are split 5050 blue collar and white collar 
he said averaging 18000 annual starting pay mostly with small 
and mediumsized businesses and public agencies 
the program started as simply a job placement service when an 
effort began to build a memorial in new york to vietnam vets 
gitelsons group supported it at public hearings 
we wore suits everyone else was in jungle fatigues he 
said we said we also have to do something about those who are 
living 
fifty cents of every dollar contributed to the memorial was 
earmarked for a jobs program and vvlp was selected as that program 
with 500000 to start it is also supported by state and federal 
funds

house members last year took trips to such 
faraway places as cyprus and ireland and as near as the oprah 
winfrey show in chicago they made speeches toured defense plants 
and wrote magazine articles they got gifts of golf sweaters and 
boxes of chocolates 
these and thousands of other details were listed in the latest 
round of financial disclosure forms filed by more than 400 members 
of the house of representatives and released on wednesday 
in general members incomes towered over the average 
americans most representatives incomes topped the 100000 mark 
last year with fees from speechmaking and articlewriting adding 
substantially to their 89500 annual salary a handful reported 
making under 100000 while more than a dozen reported assets and 
income over 1 million 
the median family income in the united states is 31526 
the forms also offered a glimpse into the workings of congress 
for example 
rep charles wilson dtexas a member of the appropriations 
defense subcommittee reported receiving money for speeches from 
several defense companies including lockheed boeing rockwell 
northrop trw aerojet general electric ltv singer and mcdonnell 
douglas 
pennsylvania rep bud shuster the secondranking republican on 
the house public works and transportation committee and the senior 
gop member of the surface transportation subcommittee reported 
receiving air fare from the outdoor advertising association for a 
trip to los angeles the association also paid him a 2000 
honorarium for a speech 
in 1986 shuster led a fight on the house floor against taking 
down billboards on the nations highways without just 
compensation to the owner the administrative aide to shuster 
ann eppard said wednesday that shuster was not so much defending 
the outdoor advertising industry as the right to compensation if 
ones property is seized 
rep e kika de la garza chairman of the house agriculture 
committee received honoraria from a number of food and textile 
groups including the national milk producers chicago mercantile 
exchange amstar sugar corp grocery manufacturers western cotton 
shippers monsanto national cotton council and the american farm 
bureau federation his reimbursed travel included a limousine ride 
to white sulphur springs wva to attend a grocery manufacturers 
meeting 
house speaker jim wright dtexas reported earnings of at least 
168000 although that did not include royalties from his book 
published reports have said that wright was paid royalties of 55 
percent from his book reflections of a public man far above 
the 10 percent to 15 percent authors normally receive 
the royalties are crucial to a demand for an ethics committee 
investigation of the democratic leader 
rep newt gingrich promised to sign the documents formally 
triggering such an investigation today for his part the georgia 
republican reported income of 122284 to 133283 
wright promised on wednesday to cooperate in any investigation 
although i know my actions have been in full accordance with 
house rules i am concerned that the matters raised have led to 
increased public discussion which i believe is unwarranted 
he said in a letter tuesday to the ethics committee 
the texas democrat also said that publication of the book had 
been halted at his orders 
while the politicians are required to reveal their finances the 
forms give only broad ranges for members income assets and debts 
for example one of the wealthier members of the house rep 
bill green reported income of at least 15 million and probably 
more than 33 million the new york republican listed assets of at 
least 39 million and probably more than 92 million 
other wealthy house members and their minimum assets included 
norman sisisky dva 827 million amory houghton jr rny

2265 million sidney yates dill 1565 million fortney 
stark dcalif 32 million e clay shaw rfla 116 million 
and mel levine dcalif 1065 million 
many of these members reported liabilities but all of them 
appeared to have net worths of at least 1 million 
while millions of dollars were revealed in the reports so were 
minuscule details 
among the exceptions to 100000plus incomes were david 
bonior dmich tim penny dminn william natcher dky 
clarence miller rohio bob dornan rcalif julian dixon 
dcalif and sherwood boehlert rny 
alex mcmillan rnc reported a long list of gifts ranging

several house members apparently are avid golfers they reported 
receiving travel reimbursements for attending golf tournaments and 
gifts of golf clothing and equipment among them was rep fernand 
st germain dri chairman of the house banking committee who 
got more than 1200 in golf shoes sweaters and accessories from 
four charity golf tournaments 
the trips by house members ranged from the appearance in chicago 
on the oprah winfrey show by rep pat schroeder dcolo mrs

the reagan administration should be wary of 
approving any deal with the soviet union that makes deep reductions 
in the two superpowers arsenals of longrange nuclear weapons a 
house armed services committee report said 
the soviets would have a greater ability than the united states 
either to break out of any such treaty or to illegally hide 
weapons according to the study by the panels defense policy 
subcommittee 
the report was released wednesday shortly after president 
reagan left for moscow for his fourth summit meeting with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
one of the agenda items at the summit is the proposed strategic 
arms reduction treaty which tentatively provides for reductions of 
up to 50 percent in each nations arsenal of longrange atomic 
weapons 
us officials say they are aiming for a start treaty that would 
leave each side with 6000 longrange nuclear weapons but many 
differences remain to be resolved 
the treaty would be a successor to a separate pact eliminating 
mediumrange nuclear weapons the senate is currently considering 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
no start agreement will come out of the summit next week and 
thats good said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed 
services committee there is a great deal to be done before arms 
control policy and weapons system decisions are harmonized 
the report called the 6000 figure an illusion because of 
the proposed methods for counting nuclear weapons for example a 
bomber would be counted as a single weapon even though each 
airplane could carry numerous nuclear bombs and missiles 
almost 3400 more soviet weapons could be legal under the 
prospective agreement the report said thus a force of nearly 
9400 soviet weapons could be legally available under start 
however it noted the same rules would apply to the united 
states in fact because the united states has more bombers it 
would probably end up with more legal weapons thus the actual 
ceiling on weapons under start is more like 900010000 on each 
side rather than 6000 the study said 
in addition the study said the treaty would be extremely 
difficult to verify opening up possibilities for cheating 
the report also noted a key difference between the proposed 
start pact and the mediumrange treaty the mediumrange missile 
pact bars flight testing of missiles such as the ss20s supporters 
of mediumrange treaty say the ban means that if the soviets are 
hiding some ss20s the missiles would quickly degrade and be of 
little military value 
but no such ban is proposed by the start deal so the military 
capability of any concealed forces will not decline over time 
the study said that would give the soviets incentive to cheat 
the report also said that for political reasons the soviets 
could find it easier to break out of start reductions 
given the history of us strategic arms development it seems 
unlikely that the president would propose such a course a 
breakout or the congress approve it a us planner however 
could not rely upon internal checks and balances in the soviet 
union 
given those uncertainties us military planners should worry 
about a soviet force not of 6000 weapons but of many many 
more the study said 
it concluded that maintaining the current doctrine of deterring 
nuclear war with the threat of overwhelming retaliation will 
require building the right type of us nuclear force even under 
start restrictions 
that force should include a number of relatively low value 
targets such as singlewarhead landbased missiles which are 
widely dispersed such weapons are harder to hit and thus increase 
deterrence when compared with high value weapons like the 
10warhead mx and the huge trident missilefiring submarines the 
study said 
but the report said the administration continues to deploy 
fewer and bigger weapons platforms even as it pursues a start 
agreement that favors smaller and more delivery systems

they may be smarter than horses and 
cuter than goats but if you want to adopt a burro you cant be as 
stubborn as a mule youll have to put your name on a waiting list 
since the federal government started its adoptaburro 
program in 1976 to alleviate serious overcrowding in western 
states thousands of the animals have been given out around the 
country 
while people were apprehensive about adopting the pets at first 
burro fever has soared now there arent enough around to meet the 
demand especially in the east and midwest 
weve got a waiting list of over 200 people who want them 
said deedee king of the american mustang and burro association in 
liberty hill texas theyre kind of the pet rock of the 80s 
king said burros which grow to the size of small ponies make 
great pets 
theyre really mellow and dont panic and get as flighty as 
horses she said in a telephone interview theyre really 
social animals and very affectionate everybody says they turn into 
great big puppy dogs 
but the animals most of which are from arizona and california 
also come in handy they can pull carts and often are used for 
predator control around smaller animals such as sheep and goats 
the 10000member association which has placed about 700 burros 
in three years is working on a breeding program for the animals 
just six years ago federal authorities rounded up thousands of 
wild burros in california saying their growing numbers threatened 
the environment 
king who also is a contractor of wild burros and horse adoption 
for the us interior departments bureau of land management said 
the government has placed more than 70000 wild horses and burros 
since 1976 but private organizations have placed thousands more 
one of those groups friends of burros inc based in marcellus 
in southwest michigan has placed about 160 burros in the state in 
the last five years said allene bell president of the 40member 
group 
were basically a support group for the people here whove 
adopted already said bell a farmer who has adopted five burros 
what were involved in now is a burro rescue program and in cases 
where we see abuse we look to buy the animal and place it 
she decided to adopt the animals after hearing about the 
roundups in the china lake area of california in the early 80s 
animal rights activists said the animals were being mistreated 
during the governments roundup 
before congress passed a law in 1971 to protect wild burros and 
horses the bureau of land management usually got rid of the 
animals by shooting them however the only animals protected are 
those on land administered by the interior department king said 
a relatively small number of wild burros and horses remain 
unprotected on military grounds and land owned by the us parks 
services she said

the senate is one step away from 
passing a bill that would ban nuclear weapons on philippine 
territory but allow port calls by nuclearpowered ships 
the bill tentatively approved on wednesday is aimed at us 
bases in the philippines and some officials view it as a slap in 
the face of the americans 
in another development the military charged that six new 
zealanders have been linked to communist rebels who staged an 
ambush in february in which a generals son and 10 other soldiers 
were killed 
the announcement followed military claims that foreign 
journalists may have paid communist new peoples army guerrillas to 
stage the ambush in albay province in which lt felix brawner iii 
and 10 of his men were killed 
brawner was the only son of brig gen felix brawner jr who 
retired last month as the military commander for northern luzon 
regarding the senate orlando mercado majority floor leader 
said the body is expected to pass the nuclear weapons bill next 
week on its third reading a formality where legislators officialy 
register their votes 
the bill prohibits manufacture or storage of nuclear weapons in 
the country but was amended to allow nuclearpowered vessels to 
make port calls after they are inspected by philippine authorities 
the chief sponsor of the measure sen wigberto tanada is an 
antinuclear activist who opposes us bases in the philippines 
most senators backed the bill and said it would give president 
corazon aquinos administration a stronger hand in negotiating with 
us officials on the future of clark air base subic naval base 
and four smaller us military facilities in the philippines 
government sources however said mrs aquino expressed 
misgivings about the bill because of the negative affect it could 
have on usphilippine ties 
sen mamintal tamano who earlier expressed concern about the 
bills implications said 
this is a backdoor way of repudiating the existing treaty 
between the us and the philippines and the termination of the 
bases agreement the americans will be very uncomfortable with such 
a law which will render the bases ineffective 
us military policy forbids the military from disclosing which 
vessels are carrying nuclear weapons 
similar legislation in denmark led to a parliamentary election 
and raised questions about that countrys committment to the nato 
alliance 
american aircraft carriers and other warships believed to carry 
nuclear weapons call frequently at subic many of them are either 
in transit to the persian gulf or are returning from duty there 
the claim linking foreign journalists to communist guerrillas 
was made by an alleged former rebel who said she was a member of a 
guerrilla unit which staged the ambush in february the military 
said 
she reportedly said the foreigners were journalists and that 
they provided money and weapons to the guerrillas to stage the 
attack 
military officials said captured rebel documents indicated the 
six new zealanders included five women and one man 
in wellington the new zealand journalists union and the public 
service association which represents journalists employed by 
stateowned media said they had no records indicating the six are 
journalists 
in the documents all six were identified as members of various 
leftwing and womens organizations in new zealand 
one of the women identified herself as a member of the new 
zealand conference for filipino concerns she also reportedly 
said she was a member of the workers communist league

panamanian nationalism and suspicions 
about us intentions regarding the panama canal stiffened resolve 
against the reagan administrations efforts to dislodge gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
indeed the breakdown of negotiations with the united states to 
ease the de facto leader out of power was partially attributed in 
panama to the threat that such a deal could pose to treaties giving 
panama control of the canal 
us secretary of state george shultz on wednesday announced in 
washington the collapse of talks and said no further negotiations 
are planned 
panama and the united states have been linked since this isthmus 
achieved independence in 1903 in fact it was us backing that 
secured panamas break from colombia and its declaring itself a 
sovereign nation 
the united states recognized the new nation immediately and 
began an association that led to the construction of the panama 
canal the creation of the canal zone and the establishment of 
military bases 
recovery of the canal zone the area around the waterway and of 
the canal itself have long been a panamanian goal 
panamanians still quote noriegas predecessor the late gen 
omar torrijos who negotiated the 1977 canal treaties with 
thenpresident jimmy carter 
torrijos who died in a 1981 plane crash and is a national idol 
once said i do not want to enter history i want to enter the 
canal zone 
washingtons antipathy for noriega began in 1987 after years of 
overt and tacit support for the man who like torrijos heads the 
15000strong panamanian defense forces and is the power behind the 
civilian government 
noriega and his supporters say the reasons for that change are 
panamanians unwillingness to bend to the giant of the north 
noriegas inclination to make friends on the left and what was 
perceived as his presidential ambitions 
noriega also says washington wants him out because he opposes 
continued american military presence in panama beyond dec 31 
1999 when the canal reverts to panamanian control 
it is believed in panama that the reagan administrations 
failure to oust noriega stems from its inability to realize the 
support he enjoys among the military and the working class as well 
the united states illfounded confidence that the political 
opposition could muster the necessary momentum 
the resiliency of panamanians to face economic hardships brought 
on by tough us sanctions also was unexpected 
washington has imposed increasingly severe economic sanctions 
since noriega was indicted in florida in february on federal 
drugtrafficking charges 
but even opposition politicians say americas sudden dislike for 
noriega responds more to us strategic interests than to concern 
for the people of panama as christian democratic leader ricardo 
arias calderon put it 
many panamanians have little use for noriega or the defense 
forces a military and police organization that controls nearly 
every aspect of life in panama yet there is deepseated suspicion 
that the united states is unwilling to cede just 11 years from 
now its extensive military installations 
the us southern command established to defend the canal has 
evolved into an intelligence gathering center and coordinator of 
us military activities for all of latin america 
already the united states has given up the canal zone a bit of 
suburban america with manicured lawns and neatly painted houses 
and transferred partial control of the canal to panama 
then the united states created the panama canal commission made 
up of five americans and four panamanians to administer the 
waterway that links the atlantic and pacific oceans 
tenthousand us military personnel are now stationed at 10 
facilities 
the united states aims to sustain and improve this system of 
military installations beyond the year 2000 to establish a much 
larger force in panama said maj daniel delgado diamante 
executive director for panama for canal treaty affairs 
according to a military source in panama the defense forces 
considers the southern command a watchtower for the united states 
and a center of espionage the information it provided the english 
during the falklands war was vital for them 
the possibility of renegotiating the us military presence was 
one of the panamanian concessions in the canal treaties 
most important among the concessions was that the united states 
in accordance with its constitutional procedures will always 
have the right to take action to defend the canal and maintain its 
neutrality 
some panamanians say this amounts to giving the united states 
the permanent right to intervene in panama

during a speech several months ago the 
us ambassador to the soviet union used a water glass to describe 
soviet progress on human rights 
holding the glass aloft ambassador jack matlock said that it 
would be inaccurate to view such a glass as half empty or half full 
its more like a glass that was dry and now has a little bit 
of moisture in it he said 
the issue of human rights is one of the touchiest subjects on 
the ussoviet agenda evidenced by a sternly worded defense of 
soviet policies by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev during the 
december summit in washington 
what moral right does america have to assume the pose of the 
teacher the general secretary asked he said that he told 
president reagan you are not the prosecutor and i am not the 
accused i am not on trial 
in an apparent attempt to soothe such touchiness reagan used 
one of his presummit speeches earlier this month to laud gorbachev 
for taking steps to loosen the stringent restrictions on the 
practice of religion freedom of speech press and emigration 
in fact the national conference on soviet jewry reported last 
week that 1086 jews departed the soviet union in april the 
highest monthly total in nearly seven years even though the figure 
has been rising for about a year it falls far short of the 1979 
levels when the monthly average was about 4000 departures 
as us officials prepare to face their soviet counterparts at 
the moscow summit the 10th session on human rights in 15 months 
they point to such signs of progress even as they warn that the 
basic system of repression has not changed 
a few years ago the entire process would have been simply 
unthinkable richard schifter the assistant secretary of state 
for human rights and humanitarian affairs said recently 
he called such discussions a good first step but only the 
beginning of an effort to see that the soviet union abides by the 
human rights provisions of the helsinki final act which it signed 
along with the united states in 1975 
besides pressing for movement in the traditional cases of 
divided families divided spouses and blocked marriages the 
administration also has on its human rights agenda the problems of 
political prisoners emigration and religious freedom 
you cannot speak of freedom of speech freedom of assembly 
freedom of association freedom of the press being recognized in 
the soviet union that is not the case but sledgehammer 
tactics are no longer being used schifter said 
freedoms are still severely limited but people are not being 
punished as harshly for alleged transgressions while 
demonstrations are still broken up he said the demonstrators 
might be arrested for a while and released rather than being sent 
to siberia for several years 
shifter said it also appears that the soviet leadership has 
basically given up on the deep commitment to conducting 
atheistic propaganda that doesnt mean they have more respect for 
religion than they had previously but they simply have decided 
that this just isnt working and they might as well tackle the 
situation differently 
he described the human rights situation as coming up to a 
better level from very very far below but nevertheless theres a 
trend there and all we can say is we wish it would continue and 
perhaps accelerate 
other experts have suggested that whatever change is taking 
place is partially due to the soviet leaderships domestic concerns 
rather than reaction to outside presssures 
one administration expert speaking on condition he not be 
identified pointed to gorbachevs overtures to the religious 
communities in particular his meeting with a group of russian 
orthodox archbishops the session apparently was held to show that 
his glasnost policy of increased openness included religion 
that could very well be seen as an effort of the soviet 
authorities to mobilize a very large portion of the population 
which has been practically excluded from civil life for decades 
the official said 
he said that gorbachev was impressive in recognizing that 
believers are soviet patriots and soviet citizens who can 
contribute 
seen in this light reagans planned visit to the danilov 
monastery and his discussions with soviet dissidents and refuseniks 
are not expected to overly concern soviet officialdom said another 
administration expert on the soviet union 
theyll act like it wont bother them they know its going to 
occur and they know the president wont do anything gratuitously 
embarrassing he said 
secretary of state george p shultz has met with dissident 
andrei sakharov and gorbachev had sessions with american citizens 
during the washington summit last december so it is fully 
anticipated that reagan will hold such sessions the expert said 
they clearly know they have to do something on human rights to 
improve relations with the united states but they wont admit 
it he said they want it to appear to be their initiative and 
if thats the case thats just fine

the hospitalization of ferdinand 
marcos in hawaii has added a new twist to the bizarre drama in 
which marcos supporters are trying to use his mothers unburied 
body to help their hero return home 
marcos was admitted on wednesday to st francis medical center 
in honolulu suffering from chest pains 
the philippine consul in honolulu tomas gomez accused the 
70yearold marcos of faking his illness to win sympathy in the 
philippines 
marcos wife imelda said in a radio interview today that her 
husband was suffering because president corazon aquino has refused 
to allow him to return to bury his 95yearold mother josefa 
edralinmarcos who died may 4 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno reiterated on wednesday 
that mrs aquino would never waver from the ban imposed in 1986 
after marcos was forced into exile following a civilianmilitary 
uprising 
meanwhile the remains of marcos mother a former 
schoolteacher continue to lie in state in a suburban church where 
dozens of marcos followers have maintained a roundtheclock vigil 
since her death three weeks ago 
indeed the body of dona josefa has become the focus of 
renewed protests by marcos dwindling followers to demand their 
leader be allowed to come home 
they have pledged that the body will stay in the church until 
marcos returns to bury it mortician frank malabed said he embalmed 
the body twice and it could remain unburied for up to three months 
to press their point marcos loyalists have organized street 
marches some drawing up to 10000 people where speakers rail 
against the government for denying marcos the human right to 
bid farewell to his mother 
the use of corpses as political instruments is not without 
precedence in philippine politics the 1983 assassination of mrs 
aquinos husband benigno was exploited by marcos opponents to 
mount street protests against the government 
more than 1 million filipinos turned out for aquinos funeral 10 
days after his assassination benigno aquinos mother aurora 
refused to have the body which lay in state in an open casket 
cleaned by morticians saying she wanted the whole world to see 
what they have done to my son 
marcos sister elizabeth keon was buried two weeks after her 
death in december 1986 as the family lobbied unsuccessfully with 
the aquino government to allow the former president to return for 
the funeral 
but even by philippine standards the saga of dona josefa 
has dragged on to bizarre lengths 
mrs edralinmarcos is expected to be buried in the family plot 
in batac in the northern philippine province of ilocos norte but 
an employee of the suburban church who refused to give her name 
said the family has still not informed the parish staff when the 
body will be moved 
the family has not yet set any particular date for the 
funeral marcos sister fortuna barba told reporters on 
wednesday when we do decide it will be properly announced and 
disseminated by us and nobody else 
uncertainty about the funeral date appears to reflect divisions 
within the promarcos camp among various groups seeking to 
demonstrate that they speak for the apo or grand old man 
as marcos is known to his followers 
one group has called for a huge caravan to accompany the body 
from manila north to batac a distance of 240 miles they have 
suggested stopping at cities along the way for public viewings in a 
bid to stir up support in marcos northern strongholds 
on tuesday rumors spread that marcos supporters would hold a 
predawn mass wednesday morning and then spirit the body secretly 
to batac reporters rushed to the church sanctuario de san jose 
only to find the coffin still there 
the unseemly performance prompted mrs barba to issue a 
statement warning against conjectures speculations canards or 
disinformation to mislead and confuse the people 
meanwhile residents of the swank greenhills neighborhood where 
the church is located have threatened to launch a petition drive 
to demand that archbishop cardinal jaime sin intervene and order 
the body removed

despite the gay and lesbian protesters who 
picket campaign appearances by democratic frontrunner michael 
dukakis the massachusetts governor is virtually certain to get 
their votes in the fall 
the choice is pretty obvious lesbians and gay men will vote 
for mike dukakis in the fall when presented with a choice between 
dukakis and republican george bush said sue hyde who was sharply 
critical of dukakis over his position on foster care by homosexuals 
for children 
vin mccarthy a boston lawyer in charge of the dukakis 
campaigns efforts to reach out to the gay community said there 
is no question in my mind that he will receive the lions share of 
the gay and lesbian vote in november 
it is dukakis support for giving heterosexual couples 
preference in placement of children in foster homes that draws gay 
protestors to his appearances but many political strategists say 
the massachusetts governor comes out ahead politically on that 
confrontation 
the vast majority of the american people agree with dukakis 
said robert beckel who managed walter f mondales 1984 
presidential campaign from a political standpoint thats a 
nowin issue for the gay community 
in fact many republicans working to elect bush chafe at the 
fact that dukakis is being perceived as a moderate because of his 
primary battles with jesse jackson and because he is being picketed 
by homosexual groups 
a democratic party strategist speaking only with assurance of 
anonymity said that a candidate such as dukakis on the verge of 
winning the partys presidential nomination is not looking to 
create fights 
but to the degree that you have to have somebody picket you 
you certainly would not mind the gays picketing you over the issue 
not of civil rights or civil liberties but over foster care for 
children saying your law is too profamily or too 
proheterosexual the democrat said 
still foster care is a highly charged issue in the gay 
community 
for dukakis to have gone out of his way to limit or restrict 
the parenting options for lesbians and gay men was a kick in the 
gut said hyde director of the privacy project for the national 
gay and lesbian task force 
hyde said she believes dukakis considers lesbians and gay men 
sexual criminals 
while campaigning in california prior to that states june 7 
presidential primary dukakis repeatedly has encountered gay 
demonstrators 
bush dukakis more aids deaths read signs carried by 
demonstrators at a recent dukakis appearance in los angeles 
we need a president whos not afraid to talk about aids 
shouted a demonstrator 
a disproportionate number of victims of aids acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome are homosexuals 
dukakis responded that massachusetts spends more per case for 
aids than any state in america he repeatedly referred to aids as 
the most serious public health problem weve had in our 
lifetime 
hyde said that in 1985 there was no funding for aids in the 
state budget and money was later included only after pressure from 
dukakis state health director 
people were pretty upset about it she said since that 
time i think that dukakis administration has been fairly 
responsive it was only after this pretty major outcry in the 
boston area around the zerofunding that they responded 
when the massachusetts governor appeared before a group of 
homosexual activists in los angeles he was asked repeatedly about 
the foster care policy 
because i think its best all things being equal for a child 
to grow up in a household with a mother and father and other 
children he said 
bigot shouted one man youre antigay why dont you 
admit it yelled another 
the massachusetts policy on placing of foster children gives 
preference to heterosexual couples with childraising experience 
and to relatives of the child in need of care 
dukakis vetoed legislation that would have prohibited homosexual 
couples from providing foster care 
mccarthy said theres a perception in the gay community that 
the governor did damage to the gay and lesbian community when he 
adopted the foster care policy attitudinal issues are always the 
toughest things to work through 
but he said notwithstanding the anger much of which was 
legitimate i certainly felt it as a gay supporter of mike dukakis 
he has stayed stable in terms of his commitment to gay and 
lesbian civil rights and in terms of a sound and balanced aids 
policy

state and long island lighting co 
negotiators early thursday reached a tentative agreement that would 
see the utility abandon the 53 billion shoreham nuclear power 
plant the governors office said 
should the agreement be finalized it would mark the first time 
a completed us nuclear power plant was abandoned before it opened 
the agreement announced by gary fryer a spokesman for gov 
mario cuomo would allow financially troubled lilco to continue to 
operate as a privately owned utility the state had been proceeding 
with a possible takeover of the entire company 
the agreement in principle was announced 95 minutes after 
cuomos midnight deadline for an agreement on wednesday cuomo had 
threatened to call off negotiations if lilco failed to agree to a 
deal and then resume the states court suit to keep shoreham closed 
at one point early thursday fryer told reporters that the deal 
had been called off shortly before midnight but then quickly 
retracted the statement after apparently receiving further 
information 
details of the agreement werent immediately available but 
cuomo had demanded that lilco restructure its management and cease 
its efforts to win a license to operate at 25 percent capacity 
those conditions have been met as part of the deal fryer said 
as part of the agreement the state would buy shoreham for 1 
and have it decontaminated and decommissioned at lilcos expense 
fryer said new generating plants would then be built on long 
island to ensure that residents have a sufficient supply of 
electricity 
the next step would be to reduce all these intricacies to 
written copy fryer said 
if approved the deal will end years of attempts by 
environmentalists local activists and others to close shoreham on 
long islands north shore 
the plant completed in 1984 has never been opened because of 
the refusal of state and local officials to approve an emergency 
evacuation plan the officials had argued that long island because 
of its geography could not be safely evacuation during a nuclear 
accident and without such approval the federal nuclear regulatory 
commission had refused to issue an operating license 
but state efforts to close shoreham accelerated after the nrc in 
october eliminated the rule requiring state and local government 
participation in an evacuation plan 
the future of the plant has been in limbo for years and the 
delays in construction and the licensing effort along with massive 
cost overruns drove lilco to near bankruptcy 
the plant conceived in 1965 was completed 10 years late and 
more than 80 times over its original budget of 65 million 
in addition to fears over the shoreham plants safety 
negotiations have been driven by the fact that lilcos nearly 1 
million customers pay the second highest electricity rates in the 
country second only to neighboring consolidated edison 
the utilitys problems were highlighted after hurricane gloria 
in september 1985 knocked out power to more than 80 percent of 
lilcos customers during the storm lilco chairman william 
catacosinos refused to return home from an italy vacation 
safety fears were heightened after the nuclear disaster at the 
chernobyl plant in the soviet union

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis trying to establish a bond with voters 3000 miles 
from home says california has great similiarities to his home 
state of massachusetts 
dukakis was in california today campaigning in advance of the 
june 7 primary but californias 47 electoral votes make it the 
biggest prize in the general election and dukakis tentatively has 
made plans to return shortly after the primary for additional 
campaigning 
both massachusetts and california have a very strong 
commitment to education he said wednesday night during a debate 
with rival jesse jackson brushing aside a comment from a panelist 
that there also were notable differences 
we are both hightech states he went on were both 
states that value our environment were both states and regions 
that are coastal states and regions that understand how important 
these ocean resources and coastline happen to be and how important 
it is to preserve them 
dukakis a methodical man campaigning in a state known for 
flamboyance made his pitch to the california voters as he set out 
on a quick campaign swing through the state on wednesday 
and as befits the almostcertain democratic nominee he made it 
clear that he is looking beyond the primary to the november 
election 
in his fiveminute closing statement during the debate he not 
only appealed for support in the primary less than two weeks away 
but also pointed out that voters will face a choice between two 
very different candidates in the fall 
public opinion polls show him leading jackson in california and 
ahead of vice president george bush the certain republican 
nominee in a fall matchup 
dukakis took care not to offend his democratic rival during 
their hourlong debate but he also held his ground when jackson 
tried to pressure him into proposing a detailed budget plan and 
into declaring south africa a terrorist state for its support of 
rebels fighting neighboring black governments 
dukakis says it is too early to make a detailed spending plan 
and wants to pursue other measures against south africa including 
stronger economic sanctions before considering tougher measures 
the two men met privately after the debate although the 
governor declined to say what they discussed beyond a lot of 
things family campaign debates issues 
dukakis used his time during the debate to repeat criticisms of 
president reagans policies but he also issued a statement wishing 
the president a successful summit with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
today we have the best opportunity in our lifetimes to reduce 
the risk of nuclear war he said 
during the debate he said the superpowers should stop 
wandering around the world like lonesome cowboys intervening

to his followers gen manuel antonio 
noriega is a symbol of panamanian nationalism a brave david 
standing firm against the imperialist goliath of washington 
detractors see panamas military leader as an unscrupulous 
despot who threatens to drag the country down with him 
the general is a shrewd tough child of poverty schooled in 
intrigue 
as far as the white house is concerned noriega is criminal a 
man who enriched himself by selling his country to colombian drug 
traffickers 
on wednesday secretary of state george p shultz announced that 
talks with noriegas people on the generals exit from power had 
broken down 
noriega managed to become head of the defense forces chief of 
panamas military and police through his loyalty to his 
predecessor and mentor gen omar torrijos 
noriega whose official biography says he is 50 has little 
faith in the ability of civilians to rule 
our young officers are much better prepared to govern when 
panama takes over the panama canal operations in the year 2000 
he once said in an interview 
the handsome charismatic torrijos changed the defense forces 
from an organization led by the social elite into a tightly 
disciplined force of 15000 with absolute police military and 
political power 
he opened the upper ranks to the lower economic classes and 
created a base of power from a new generation of officers noriega 
a poor boy who went to military school in peru on a scholarship 
was among them 
less than a year after taking power in a coup in 1968 torrijos 
made noriega an obscure provincial lieutenant with only four years 
of military service his chief of intelligence 
noriega quickly began collecting dossiers on everyone who 
counted in panama friends and enemies alike he developed close 
ties with us intelligence agencies interested in any potential 
threat to the security of the panama canal a vital shipping link 
between the atlantic and pacific oceans 
torrijos also gave noriega jurisdiction over customs and 
immigration long a source of funds for the military 
after torrijos died in an unexplained plane crash in 1981 it 
took noriega about two years to shoulder his way to the top 
command once there noriega boldly exercised his power and 
tolerated little opposition 
he closed the private news media for months at a time for 
alleged offenses ranging from personal insults to incitment to 
disobedience unhappy with the outcome of the first popular 
election in 16 years noriega installed his own president in 1984 
noriega a short jowly pockmarked man his detractors call 
pineapple face never possessed the charisma of his populist 
mentor but he was backed by the democratic republican party which 
torrijos founded 
as demands for noriegas ouster have grown during the past year 
the party vowed to stick by him to the end and portrayed him as 
the defender of panamanian sovereignty and dignity in the face 
of us aggression 
noriega has worked hard to develop the image of a man of the 
people his private life is that of a rich man but publicly he has 
stressed his humble origins and spent weekends courting the 
residents of rural towns and villages 
with the deepening of his political crisis noriega has tried to 
use his popular image to build support in this nation of 22 
million people many of them black and mulatto 
the humble the poor the blacks they are the utmost 
authority of this people he said in one speech 
his official salary is 60000 a year but he is said to have his 
finger in a wide range of enterprises among them dutyfree liquor 
stores maritime services banks gambling casinos newspapers a 
television station and 12 radio stations

the house has sent to the senate a 143 
billion foreign aid bill that includes a ban on aid to any foreign 
government or military force involved in drug trafficking bribery 
tax evasion graft or price fixing 
rep david obey dwis offered the amendment banning aid to 
those nations involved in drugs or other crimes after rep robert 
walker rpa offered one limited to drugs 
if were against the baddies of this world we might as well 
be against them all obey said 
obeys amendment was approved on a voice vote 
the foreign aid bill passed by the house on a 32890 vote was 
the first separate foreign aid package the the house has approved 
since 1981 lawmakers generally are reluctant to support spending 
overseas when domestic needs go unfulfilled and in recent years 
the legislation has been buried in large catchall spending bills 
but last falls deficit reduction agreement set the overall 
foreign aid spending level for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 a 
bipartisan compromise with administration support was reached in 
the house appropriations committee on how to divide up that pie 
about 58 billion of the total would be earmarked for military 
aid 33 billion in economic grants and most of the remainder for 
the united nations and international organizations and financial 
institutions 
overall the bill would continue current programs and authorize 
about 2 percent more spending than last year reversing the trend 
of the past few years to cut foreign aid 
israel and egypt would receive about a third of the money in the 
bill israel again would receive more than any other country 18 
billion in military aid and 12 billion in economic assistance 
egypt would get 13 billion in military assistance and 815 
million in economic aid 
pakistan would receive 220 million in economic aid and 240 
million dollars in forgiven loans for purchase of military goods 
the philippines would receive about 250 million half in 
military assistance about 700 million in economic assistance 
would go to african countries 
in central america honduras would get 85 million in economic 
aid costa rica 90 million el salvador 185 million and guatemala 
80 million military aid for those and other countries was not 
earmarked but would come out of separate military aid and credit 
accounts aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua was not part of the 
legislation 
about 100 countries receive us aid directly 
besides obeys amendment another voice vote removed the 
earmarking of money for specific countries cooperating with us 
drug eradication efforts allowing the individual totals to be set 
later based on the performance of the countries

the senate has joined the house in taking aim 
against plastic guns whether they be handguns designed to pass 
through metal detectors or just toys 
by a voice vote the senate on wednesday approved legislation to 
outlaw the manufacture sale or possession of handguns made from 
plastic or other undetectable parts that could evade metal 
detectors 
the measure primarily is directed at terrorists and airplane 
hijackers but was amended to include a requirement that all toy 
guns have orange plugs in their barrels to clearly identify them as 
toys 
this bill is designed to prevent a nightmare from becoming 
reality said sen howard metzenbaum dohio who cosponsored 
the legislation with sen strom thurmond rsc 
its aim is to keep terrorists from getting powerful 
undetectable firearms which could be smuggled past security devices 
at airports courtrooms and even the white house metzenbaum said 
the plastic gun ban is similar to legislation approved by the 
house 4134 earlier this month differences between the two bills 
will have to be ironed out before the gun ban is sent to president 
reagan for his signature 
the nations major law enforcement groups lobbied heavily for 
the legislation and worked out the compromise language with 
attorney general edwin meese iii the national rifle association 
after initial reluctance went along with the approach 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas a sponsor of the 
amendment to clearly identify toy guns said realistic plastic guns 
have been used in the commission of crimes such as bank robbery 
hostage takings and street crime 
dole also recalled that in one case a police officer in 
california accidentally shot a youth playing with a toy laser gun 
after mistaking the toy for a firearm 
an amendment by metzenbaum added provisions that would make it a 
crime to possess a firearm in a federal courtroom increase 
penalties for possession of explosives in airports and boost 
penalties for use or possession of explosives in commission of a 
federal felony 
the senate legislation would require that all firearms be as 
detectable as a 37ounce stainless steel handgun all guns 
currently manufactured or imported into the united states would 
have to meet the test 
while the senate bill sets a detectability standard the 
housepassed measure requires that the gun itself contain 37 
ounces of metal 
the senate measure also would require that new stateoftheart 
metal detectors be used at airports federal courthouses and other 
federal security checkpoints the house bill does not include the 
metal detector provision

budget problems will force beachgoers to swim 
at their own risk this summer in this town which has its own 
lifesaving museum 
its not funded selectman claudette fitzsimmons said of the 
lifeguard allotment its not going to be funded 
the town 10 miles southeast of boston has allocated less than 
24000 to pay eight fulltime and four parttime summer police 
officers about equal to the payroll for 10 lifeguards and a 
supervisor 
when the budget was being considered it came down to a 
judgment call whether it was seasonal lifeguards or seasonal police 
officers said exeuctive administrator christopher j mccabe 
so four beaches normally supervised by hull lifeguards will not 
be staffed this year 
police chief donald f brooker contended that summer police are 
badly needed to deal with overflows on hot days hulls population 
of 10000 swells to 100000 on the hottest days 
hull is in the middle of a prolonged fiscal crisis a referendum 
is scheduled for june 27 to seek approval for an additional 15 
million in taxes on top of the already approved 15 million 
operating budget none of the additional money is slated for 
lifeguards 
local hero joshua jamess rescue of shipwreck victims more than 
100 years ago gave rise to hulls claim to lifesaving fame 
judith wiers director of the hull lifesaving museum said its 
ironic that a town with hulls history would have to cut its 
lifeguards 
we have a really strong fire department that wears a badge of 
joshua james on their sleeves some are descendants of the original 
lifesavers she said theres a commitment to lives here

a teenager who left her infant sons alone 
for three hot days was ordered to practice birth control for the 
rest of her childbearing years by a judge who rebuked her as a 
child having children 
other terms of a lifetime probation given to debra ann forster 
prohibit her from seeing the two boys as well as a daughter she 
later bore she must also provide weekly reports to the probation 
office on her birth control use 
ms forster 18 pleaded guilty in april to two counts of felony 
child abuse for leaving her two sons alone in an apartment without 
food or water for three days last may she could have received 30 
years in prison 
the boys william and scott respectively 18 months and 6 
monthsold at the time were hospitalized eight days for 
malnutrition lesions caused by a rash and dehydration scott was 
close to death from dehydration when he was found the police said 
both have since recovered 
temperatures for the threeday period ranged from 100 during the 
day and 73 at night the average was 87 degrees the national 
weather service says 
the children were found by ms forsters estranged husband 
bill who called police authorities removed the children from the 
house and ms forster was arrested hours later when she showed up 
at the mesa police department 
judge lindsay ellis budzyn said the sentence was the only way 
she could make sure the woman would not hurt other children since 
society offers little or no support for potential abusers 
we dont have a lot of help out there for people the 
maricopa county superior court judge said in an interview 
wednesday a day after issuing the sentence 
but alice bendheim an american civil liberties union attorney 
called it an incredible sentence and doubted it would hold up 
under constitutional pressures 
im sure judge budzyn thought it was a sentence that fit the 
crime but we have a system that doesnt allow such an intrusion 
into private life said ms bendheim who is on the aclus 
national board 
as the judge pronounced the sentence she told ms forster 
your case represents the epitome of whats wrong with our 
society a child having children 
i know i did something wrong and i have to pay for it ms 
forster replied im sorry 
on wednesday the judge characterized ms forster as a young 
woman of average intelligence who is emotionally immature 
ms forster gave birth to a daughter while in jail awaiting the 
childabuse trial according to court records a family friend 
adopted the daughter and the sons were being placed through an 
adoption agency 
ms forster was released from custody tuesday and will live in a 
treatment center court officials have refused to release the name 
of the center saying ms forster has received death threats 
although the order requires the woman to submit written proof to 
her probation officer that she is using some form of birth control 
she will not be required to undergo any physical testing budzyn 
said 
there would be no way with an order like this that she would 
be subject to physical tests the judge said 
bruce griffen a defense attorney in a 1986 childabuse case in 
which the defendant was initially sentenced to undergo 
sterilization said he believed the judge had gone too far 
i think the court has acted outside its role and 
limitations griffen said 
the arizona supreme court later vacated the sterilization 
sentence in the case in which the abused child died 
griffen said that ruling could apply to an appeal of the 
sentence by ms forsters attorney assistant public defender 
robert billar 
billar was said by his office to be in court wednesday and not 
available for comment

a house panel is calling for a tax on some of 
the activities of colleges hospitals and other nonprofit 
organizations that often compete directly with taxpaying businesses 
under a proposal that won tentative approval of the house ways 
and means oversight subcommittee wednesday college bookstores 
might have to pay tax on some of their computer sales and a museum 
might be taxed on food sales if an eating facilities caters 
primarily to the general public 
although aides said the package of proposals was given a 
preliminary endorsement by most subcommittee members it is a long 
way from becoming law in this election year no similar legislation 
is pending in the senate 
neither rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the subcommittee 
nor don chapoton assistant secretary of the treasury for tax 
policy who assisted in drafting the proposals would comment on 
their content the legislation was put together behind closed doors 
however a subcommittee staff member who would not be quoted by 
name offered reporters a general outline of the package and said 
the treasury department agrees with most of the provisions she 
said the subcommittee would take a final look at the package early 
next month 
the proposals would strengthen the unrelatedbusinessincome 
tax which was enacted in 1950 to protect small businesses 
against unfair competition from taxexempt organizations the 
subcommittee began drafting the new legislation after months of 
complaints from businesses that they are still finding it hard to 
compete 
chapoton testifying before the subcommittee earlier this month 
cautioned against any broad overhaul of the tax but he endorsed an 
effort to apply the tax specifically to certain activities of 
taxexempt organizations it was that approach that won preliminary 
endorsement of pickles subcommittee 
in general income from gift shops and bookstores operated by 
taxexempt organizations would be taxed with exceptions for 
lowcost mementos the tax would be applied to most catalog and 
mailorder sales 
a college bookstore could continue to avoid tax on income from 
items that are in furtherance of educational programs 
textbooks for example and on a portion of computer sales to 
students one subcommittee member said the bookstore could avoid 
tax on sales of computers to up to half the student body per year 
so long as a professor signed a statement that a computer was a 
necessity for a course 
the tax also would be applied to income from some sales or 
rental of medical equipment including hearing aids and oxygen 
tanks travel and tour services offered by schools museums and 
other nonprofit organizations would fall under the tax as would 
their adjunct offpremise food services the tax would apply to 
most hotel facilities that are patronized by the general public 
authorities have not estimated how much tax would be collected 
under the proposal however aides emphasize the package is aimed 
at improving fairness not raising revenue 
at the ways and means hearing earlier this month frank s 
swain chief advocacy counsel for the small business 
administration said present law has allowed nonprofits to earn 
nontaxable income from activities never contemplated by congress 
the distinction between the two sections has become blurred 
in some instances beyond recognition

a spokesman for gen manuel antonio 
noriega said washington staged a vulgar ambush by hinting the 
uspanama crisis was ending then blaming the military leader for 
the collapse of negotiations 
some noriega associates said the talks were not over yet 
panamas 67member legislative assembly has summoned noriega for 
a status report on the negotiations opposition parties said they 
would not attend noriega is scheduled to appear before the 
assembly this afternoon 
us secretary of state george p shultz said on wednesday that 
a us negotiating effort to induce noriega the power behind the 
civilian government to go into exile this summer broke down and no 
further talks were planned 
at the final moment in negotiations noriega would not carry 
through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated 
shultz said no offers remain on the table 
a progovernment newspaper la republica said the military was 
nervous about some of the tentative agreements 
maj edgardo lopez noriegas spokesman called the situation a 
vulgar ambush mounted by the state department and shultz aimed 
at throwing noriega off balance and regaining the lost american 
initiative 
lopez noted that noriega had said publicly there could be no 
agreement as long as american aggression against panama 
continued and that the talks were conversations not 
negotiations 
a panamanian government spokesman boris moreno said the united 
states failed in an attempt to impose its demands then tried to 
put out false versions of the events 
moreno contended that panamanian negotiators never agreed to 
discuss dismissal of us drug smuggling charges against noriega 
he added that the sole panamanian aim was to cease economic 
aggression and military threats against the panamanian people 
key provisions of the proposed agreement called for noriegas 
resignation in august as commander of the panamanian defense 
forces his departure from panama and in exchange the dismissal 
of the drug smuggling indictments 
the goal was to remove noriega from the panamanian political 
scene as the country moved toward civilianled rule with 
presidential elections in may 1989 
the united states has been seeking noriegas removal since he 
was indicted in february by a federal grand jury in miami on 
charges of taking at least 46 million in payoffs from colombias 
socalled medellin cartel to protect cocaine shipments launder 
money and hide drug smugglers from law enforcement officials 
miami attorney neal sonnett who represents noriega on the drug 
indictments said in miami that he doubts the talks have ended 
i have heard that only from the secretary of state and i 
remember hearing the secretary of state say that last march 
sonnett said on wednesday 
la republica said the critical issue was the presidency of 
manuel solis palma who took over after noriega engineered the 
dismissal of president eric arturo delvalle in february 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as the nations 
legitimate president delvalle has been in hiding since his ouster 
and there is an arrest warrant out for him 
la republica said the military rejected the points of 
conversation because they found no guarantee for the continuity of 
the constitutional mandate of solis palma 
military officials also feared the agreement as proposed would 
cause political confrontations among panamanians the newspaper 
said 
for us solis palma is president but the united states insists 
on recognizing delvalle said luis gomez a legislator from the 
governing revolutionary democratic party and a close ally of 
noriega 
he contended the talks are only in recess after an inability 
to smooth out a few final problems 
both delvalle and solis palma were put in office by the 
military come from relative political obscurity and are part of a 
long line of similar presidents

a jury has ruled that warner bros records 
must pay more than 32 million in damages to a rival recordmaker 
for breaching an agreement with grammy awardwinning jazz guitarist 
george benson 
the suit filed by creed taylor inc alleged that warner bros 
earned more than 20 million in net profits from three albums that 
the guitarist made while he was obliged to make three records for 
cti 
cti alleged it was forced into bankruptcy proceedings because it 
lost benson who was the top recording artist on the cti label when 
the agreement was made in 1975 
the 11member los angeles county superior court jury agreed 
wednesday that the agreement had been breached but jurors appeared 
to be deadlocked in trying to determine whether warner had acted 
with malice or fraud 
judge dion g morrow said he would declare a mistrial on that 
portion of the lawsuit if the jury was unable to reach a decision 
today 
benson won three grammy awards in 1976 including two for songs 
from his warner album breezin one of the biggest selling 
jazz albums of all time he followed that with two other albums on 
the warner label in flight and weekend in la 
attorneys for warner argued that the companys net profits from 
the three albums amounted to only 108 million and that even if 
ctis allegations were true its profits would have been far less 
than that

attorney general edwin meese iii is waging an 
aggressive campaign to offset the political damage his legal 
troubles have caused the republican party says a congressman 
in two meetings wednesday which he initiated meese made clear 
he has no intention of resigning and intends to advance the 
conservative agenda in the waning months of the reagan 
administration said participants in the discussions 
he said the justice department will aggressively prosecute child 
pornography cases work to break a logjam on judicial nominations 
and help lead the administrations attack on drugs 
meese offered an 18page rebuttal to criticism of his assistance 
to scandalplagued wedtech corp and told another group of 
conservatives the free congress research and education foundation 
his conduct has been entirely proper 
at a meeting with 16 conservative congressmen a couple of 
members said the yearold criminal investigation of meese is 
resulting in political damage being done said robert walker 
rpa head of a group of conservative house members called the 
conservative opportunity society walker said the context of 
political damage was to the republican party and the 
presidential campaign of vice president george bush the likely gop 
nominee 
walker said meese was told that if he is going to take an 
aggressive stance in response to criticism it is going to have 
to be a very good offense 
meese acknowledged he would have to take that kind of 
aggressive position to stem the political damage said walker 
he felt he had a duty in terms of himself and the law and 
politics to clear the air 
he made it quite clear that he has no intention of 
resigning said walker 
meese also met at his own urging with senior editors of the 
washington times a conservative newspaper that recently called on 
the attorney general to resign 
in a report on the interview today meese said he recently 
discussed his legal problems with bush 
im not going to do anything to hurt the vice president he 
said adding that the only negative impact on bushs presidential 
campaign is that a lot of people ask him questions about this 
which takes up time to answer which ought to be reserved for 
answers on the issues 
meese said he stays in pretty close touch with the people 
who advise president reagan on public opinion polls and would 
take into account poll data on whether i am damaging the 
president 
meese told the congressmen a report in the next few weeks by an 
independent counsel who has been investigating meese since may 11 
1987 will clear him completely said rep cass ballenger 
rnc who attended the meeting the report is expected to raise 
questions about meeses ethical behavior but participants said 
that issue didnt come up in the discussion

jesse jackson took michael dukakis to task 
over budget matters and south africa but he emerged from a meeting 
with his democratic presidential rival saying that the two are 
keenly aware of our joint responsibility to our party 
the two aired a few disagreements during a debate wednesday 
night but spent far more time talking about matters they agreed on 
jackson was campaigning in california today in recent days he 
has been stumping hard in the state which holds its primary june 7 
jackson also had stops planned later today in new mexico which 
holds its primary the same day as californias 
during the onehour debate in san francisco jackson pressed 
dukakis for details about his budget plan in response dukakis 
said trying to formulate a detailed budget plan so far in advance 
would be a serious mistake 
jackson kept pressing him however saying that the governor 
is laying out a budget of promises but not a budget of numbers 
when jackson asked dukakis if he would use military force 
against south africa the massachusetts governor replied that he 
would press for more effective sanctions 
dukakis later added yes one aspect of a tough antiterrorist 
policy is the use of military force against terrorist base camps 
but there are many ways to attack terrorism 
but jackson reserved his toughest comments for criticism of the 
reagan administrations dealings with panamanian leader manuel 
antonio noriega the debate came hours after secretary of state 
george p shultz announced that talks aimed at getting noriega to 
step down had collapsed 
jackson mocked the administrations efforts to negotiate with 
the military leader 
all we really know is there was this courtship of noriega by 
the administration there was marriage to noriega putting him 
on the payroll there was a divorce and then there was the 
bargain to patch up the marriage jackson said now were being 
discredited in a failed policy 
earlier wednesday he made a speech criticizing administration 
policy in central america 
the 10 billion spent chasing 3 million sandinistas that 
money should have been spent chasing poverty illiteracy and 
disease and building houses in central america jackson said 
it was immoral and illegal and a misappropriation of funds 
the democratic contender helped load food and medical supplies 
onto a truck bound for central america 
after the debate jackson met privately with dukakis and spoke 
of the need to keep expanding our coalition he also joked they 
had talked about trying to balance my ticket with a 
conservative 
jackson said the two also discussed party unity 
we are keenly aware of our joint responsibility to keep 
expanding our party and build a strong coalition

a few years ago an ofttold story goes a city 
traffic cop had somehow obtained a handheld radar gun and decided 
to test it by clocking the speeding motorcade of thensoviet leader 
leonid i brezhnev 
as the communist party chiefs shiny black zil limousine two 
others bearing bodyguards and a pair of volga sedans flashed onto 
the horizon of kutuzovsky prospekt the officer aimed the detector 
at the fastapproaching motorcade 
the radar gun broke as it crashed to the ground dropped by the 
policeman who had been shot between the eyes by sharpshooting 
secret police agents who guard the soviet leader 
the story cannot be verified and may well be apochryphal as 
radar traps are still rare in the soviet capital but the armed 
guards who ride in the leaders motorcade with their gun barrels 
poised low in the open car windows are reputed to be expert 
riflemen 
and the tale of the hapless policeman surfaces whenever talk 
turns to security around the kremlin leader 
protection of the current ruler or visiting dignitaries is more 
effectively ensured in a police state where the untold legions of 
secret agents keep a close eye on known troublemakers and are less 
encumbered than their western counterparts by rules protecting 
citizens civil rights 
the risk of a terrorist strike against soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev or president reagan during their may 29june 2 meetings 
here is probably lower than in just about any other country of the 
world but the measures taken to protect them will be no less 
visible than in the most dangerous spots on the globe 
soviet founder vladimir i lenin was wounded in a 1918 
assassination attempt inspiring development of a security force 
around the leader that strengthened during the nearly three decades 
that dictator jos ef v stalin was in power 
no other attempts on the life of the leader have been 
documented although there have been rumors about several 
including against gorbachev 
gun ownership has been forbidden here since the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution that brought the soviets to power and illegal 
possession of firearms carries a fiveyear prison term soviets are 
even prohibited from carrying hunting knives without special 
permits attesting that the potential weapons are part of a national 
costume or for actual use while hunting 
secrecy surrounds most of the movements of the soviet leader and 
his guests with exact departure and arrival times for trips 
outside the capital kept secret from all but the uppermost echelon 
of power when the official tass news agency announces that 
gorbachev will visit a western nation it usually specifies only in 
which half of the month the trip will take place 
the first indication that the soviet leader has left the capital 
for his summer vacation is often the arrival of paving crews on 
kutuzovsky prospekt the route regularly traveled by the leader to 
and from the kremlin 
traffic in both directions of kutuzovsky is forced to the outer 
lanes when top officials or state guests travel the broad 
thoroughfare while the privileged center lane is left clear for 
the vips as the leader approaches traffic lights along the route 
are switched to green by policemen who man the controls in 
miniature glassenclosed control towers overlooking the central 
streets 
most of the meetings between reagan and gorbachev will take 
place within the heavily fortified kremlin vehicles can enter only 
through two archways with dozens of armed kgb guards in sight and 
others likely at the ready behind the historic fortress crenelated 
russet walls 
if reagan chooses to make an impromptu stop among the crowds of 
soviets lined up along the streets to greet him as gorbachev did 
during his washington stay the presidents own secret service 
agents will keep a wary eye on the flock of flagwaving welcomers 
one of reagans secret service agents was asked during the 
washington summit whether the superpowers two squads of bodyguards 
are able to work well together 
he replied that their work styles were so similar its like 
theyre working out of our manual 
gorbachevs bodyguards often resemble reagans in appearance as 
well as demeanor the tall welldressed men with their trim 
haircuts and tiny earphones connected to twoway radios are 
quickly identifiable during the leaders televised talks with 
soviet citizens they encircle gorbachev and face away from him 
silently scanning the crowd for suspicious movement 
security has always been tight around the soviet leader but the 
net has pulled in even closer over the past two years 
rumors of an assassination attempt spread through the capital 
after gorbachev and his wife raisa visited the southern russian 
city of krasnodar in september 1986 both appeared on television a 
few days after their return looking tan and fit but the number of 
bodyguards more than doubled at that time and screenings of 
reporters and onlookers at public events intensified 
metal detectors are rarely used in the soviet union but have 
been appearing recently as security for gorbachev appearances and 
uniformed police at the entrances to virtually all public buildings 
closely check visitors credentials and search purses and camera 
bags before permitting entry 
when reporters are allowed into the kremlin for photo sessions 
or political meetings they must clear a dozen security checkpoints 
before entering the room in which the session is to take place 
during reagans visit to moscow the routine will likely 
intensify as the soviet hosts seek to preserve their image as a 
country rarely touched by terrorism

a flight mechanic who stole a private jet and 
killed himself after a 1600mile joyride was upbeat until the 
moment his radio went silent says the pilot who talked him through 
a safe landing 
i was shocked said bob cunningham who helped his former 
coworker mike christiansen 24 land the plane at stapleton 
international airport on wednesday the thing that stays in my 
mind is that he did take his life after all that 
within minutes of the relatively routine landing police fbi 
agents and emergency crew members who approached the twinengine 
learjet 36a found christiansen dead at the controls of a gunshot 
wound 
as the crash crew and law enforcement personnel approached he 
was ordered to lock his brakes said stapleton spokesman richard 
boulware they heard a noise and when they looked in the cockpit 
they found him dead things happened really fast 
the fbi and the federal aviation administration have begun 
investigations to find out why christiansen stole the 10seat jet 
from patrick henry international airport in newport news va why 
he killed himself and where he obtained the gun 
the indication was that he just wanted to fly around for 
awhile boulware said 
christiansen who did not have pilots license worked as a 
flight mechanic at the virginia airport for the atlantabased 
flight international which owned the plane he stole officials 
said the company operates the worlds largest fleet of learjets 
pete daikos spokesman for patrick henry airport said 
christiansen took off early wednesday clipping a security guards 
van on a runway and shearing off part of a wingtip fuel tank the 
guard escaped injury 
cunningham 42 who worked with christiansen at international 
jet aviation services in denver last year said he was preparing 
for a flight from denver to his hometown of albuquerque nm when 
air traffic control officials asked for his help in landing the jet 
he was upbeat on the radio and responded readily i asked him 
several times how he was doing and he came back and said he was 
doing fine said cunningham at one point he asked christiansen 
how he was and christiansen replied feeling great 
after christiansen landed cunningham asked are you ok mike 
mike are you ok have you got that thing shut down yet there 
was no reply and boulware said christiansen was found dead 
moments later 
christiansen apparently grew up in colorado and attended 
colorado aerotech in broomfield last year he was certified by the 
faa to work on aircraft in june 
international jet officials said he worked as aircraft cleaner 
and helper for about 10 months resigning in august to take a job 
with continental airlines in march he moved to virginia 
cunningham recalled christiansen as a very personable man 
who sometimes acted as his chauffeur during his stops at stapleton 
i believe he was in school at the time training to be a 
flight mechanic and that was on his mind of course cunningham 
said he did the job well to my knowledge 
cunningham said he did not know why christiansen stole the 
plane we didnt have time to go into too much background he 
said we wanted to get the plane down safely 
attempts to reach christiansens family members by telephone at 
the lakewood address christiansen gave the faa were unsuccessful 
the associated press made 30 calls to the apartment complex where 
he lived in virginia and found only one resident at home she said 
she never had heard of him

let the rest of the country attack the 
stubborn weed with trowels and poisons adrian r wells prefers to 
grow his dandelions by the acre then put them in cans so people 
can eat them 
wells who owns a canning company that has been in the family 
for four generations plans to ship 1000 cases of dandelion greens 
this year from his little cannery in the western maine foothills 
wells who hates to see a thriving dandelion go to waste talks 
about the plant with fondness respect and knowledge the roots he 
explains can be made into herbal tea the bright yellow blossoms 
can be pickled or made into wine and jelly the leaves are 
excellent cooked or served fresh in salads 
and the stem you use that to siphon gas out of someones 
car wells deadpans he admits he has grown weary of offers of 
dandelions from homeowners plagued by the hearty prolific weeds 
wells sees dandelions tendency to grow back after being 
snipped a trait that frustrates gardeners as another plus five 
days after the last batch of foothigh dandelions was harvested 
new shoots appeared 
wells ws wells and son cannery was founded 102 years ago by 
his grandfather walter scott wells the barnsize factory also 
packages beans and cans beet greens and a vegetative delicacy known 
as fiddleheads 
fiddleheads named for their deepgreen stems that are 
gracefully curled a couple of inches from the ground before they 
sprout into ostrich ferns in swampy northern woodlands in late 
spring make up the bulk of the products bearing wells belle of 
maine label his only competition comes from canners in canada 
where fiddleheads also are popular 
while fiddleheads are best known to new englanders who gather 
them with ritualistic zeal in late spring they have a few 
scattered devotees as far away as california wells 52 also ships 
fiddleheads to fashionable restaurants in new york and 
philadelphia and i do a whale of a business in boston 
the four seasons restaurant in new york serves 300 pounds of 
fresh fiddleheads a week in the spring and features a soft shell 
crab and fiddlehead combination as one of its signature dishes 
said purchaser bob menge 
its a unique type of vegetable i dont even know if you 
call it a vegetable said menge its got a wonderful flavor to 
me sort of between a string bean and asparagus 
wells loves to eat fiddleheads even though he cant quite pin 
down what gives them appeal 
there isnt that much flavor to a fiddlehead said wells 
who likes them salted and slathered with butter or served in one of 
his wifes fiddlehead quiches to me it tastes like a 
fiddlehead 
wells company also pickles fiddleheads and dandelions 
the harvest is now in full swing while wells cultivates and 
harvests the monstrous dandelions that grow in neat rows on his 
land he hires up to 200 pickers from children to a woman in her 
70s to gather the young ferns from secret patches all over maine 
and in parts of vermont and new york 
wells compared fiddlehead pickers to sport fishermen when 
they find a good spot they keep it a secret 
this season wells expects to can at least 1200 cases plus ship 
15 tons of fresh fiddleheads to market as the canning season 
peaked in late may some cannery workers had been on the job for 
nearly 20 straight days 
pat stanley who trims the stems and cleans a brown flaky skin 
from fiddleheads before they are washed blanched and canned said 
she has been working pretty near seven days a week 
adrian r wells jr the 22yearold manager of the plant and 
the fourth generation of the family of canners said he had just 
finished working 22 straight 14hour days when his wife gave birth 
to their first son 
im tired as hell he said as he loaded armfuls of 
fiddleheads into a bin for cleaning

france today detonated its 
biggest nuclear test since 1985 in the south pacific exploding a 
bomb equivalent to 80000 tons of dynamite scientists said 
the underground test on mururoa atoll was the second this year 
and the 97th in a series started in 1975 when france abandoned 
atmospheric testing in the south pacific said warwick smith 
director of the seismological observatory in wellington 
scientists at new zealands monitoring station in raratonga 
cooks islands recorded the blast at 501 am 1101 am edt 
wednesday saying it was an 80kiloton bomb 
it was the largest french test on mururoa since may 1985 when 
france detonated a 90kiloton bomb france set off a 20kiloton 
blast on mururoa on may 12 six more tests are expected this year 
france as a matter of policy does not comment on reports of its 
testing 
foreign minister russell marshall condemned the latest test 
noting the program is continuing against strong opposition from 
countries in the region 
i am seriously concerned about continued french nuclear 
testing in the south pacific said marshall who is also minister 
for disarmament there can be no doubt that continued french 
nuclear testing in the south pacific is disquieting to the 
region he said in a statement 
marshall said it was ironic that french testing had brought 
south pacific countries closer together culminating in a decision 
to declare the region a nuclearfree zone 
he said it would be a profound relief to countries of the 
south pacific if france signed protocols to the treaty and ceased 
testing

security was light for the more than 30 heads of government and

midway through the 15day strike wave that 
ended this month tentative agreement was at hand for the communist 
leaderships architect of economic reform to meet with solidarity 
chief lech walesa 
but the promise of the first direct contact in six years between 
prominent opposition leaders and authorities went unfulfilled when 
walesa joined a strike at the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
now there are signs such talks may actually be in the offing 
the thread of dialogue may actually have a better chance 
because of the strikes ryszard wojna a leading communist deputy 
in parliament was quoted as saying in this weeks issue of the 
official newspaper odrodzenie rebirth 
senior communist leaders are encouraging talk of an 
anticrisis pact by which the opposing camps would agree on and 
unite behind a program to breathe life into a lethargic economy 
the idea was raised by historian bronislaw geremek a close 
adviser to walesa in an interview published in february by the 
official press publication of an interview with such a prominent 
opposition figure was in itself an unusual event 
spurring the renewed search for dialogue is the sense that the 
impasse that has prevailed since a 1981 military crackdown on the 
solidarity independent labor federation cannot continue forever 
polands economic crisis is especially acute and the 
governments attempt to institute reforms has won scant public 
support 
authorities have raised prices 45 percent this year and say they 
plan to reduce central management of the economy and encourage more 
free enterprise but according to one recent public opinion poll 
just 7 percent of the public believes the program will succeed 
a pact on reform with the opposition which demands a voice in 
shaping it could improve its chances and encourage the assistance 
of western lenders 
although it is not clear who would speak to whom the idea for 
an anticrisis pact appears to be gaining advocates within 
official circles and walesa said on tuesday that the idea is being 
considered by solidarity 
earlier this month politburo member alfred miodowicz leader of 
the official unions created after solidarity was outlawed in 1982 
said he would not rule out meeting walesa if it would improve the 
public mood 
walesa last met with a senior government official during his 
postmartial law internment in march 1982 
wojna said in the odrodzenie interview that he envisioned that 
deputy prime minister zdzislaw sadowski the governments architect 
of reform and a team of party economic experts would meet with a 
dozen or so opposition representatives 
wojna said such a meeting could be successful if all 
propaganda demagogy and mutual prejudices were left in the 
cloakroom 
he said the canceled meeting of sadowski and walesa had 
represented a thin thread of dialogue but still it indicated 
the direction of thinking 
sadowskis spokesman jerzy malkowski said on wednesday that 
sadowskis attitude toward such a meeting is still the same 
open 
and chief government spokesman jerzy urban told his weekly news 
conference on tuesday that one certainly can expect further 
active striving for talks and cooperation with the opposition 
asked specifically about a meeting between sadowski and walesa 
he said it was not possible at present but the future will show 
how it will go 
from his home in gdansk walesa responded i have said that 
they would come to us on their knees and they will sooner or 
later my problem now is whether i should wait until they do or 
not 
reinstatement of independent solidarity locals was a key demand 
by participants in most of the five major strikes that began april 
25 and ended may 10 it was championed with the greatest vigor by 
strikers at the gdansk shipyard who ended their stoppage 
peacefully but without resolution and the lenin steelworks outside 
krakow whose strike security forces crushed 
poland is afflicted with a 39 billion foreign debt climbing 
inflation low wages and lack of capital to overhaul its outmoded 
industrial plant 
the governments economic reform progam aims to decrease 
bureaucracy encourage private and managerial enterprise reduce 
central planning and make the economy more marketoriented but 
implementation has been slow 
solidarity supports the programs direction but says it is 
doomed to fail unless the government enters a dialogue with 
opposition groups 
three times in postwar poland price increases have led to labor 
unrest that has toppled governments

evan mechams defense attorney says hes 
surprised that lawyers were able to find enough acceptable jurors 
for the ousted governors criminal trial 
a 24member panel was made final wednesday after two days of 
juror questioning in maricopa county superior court this 
afternoon prosecution and defense lawyers were to eliminate six 
members each to assemble the final eightmember jury with four 
alternates 
opening statements were scheduled for june 2 in the trial of the 
former governor and his brother willard on charges of concealing 
a 350000 campaign loan 
mecham defense lawyer michael scott said he was surprised that 
enough acceptable panelists were found because of the extensive 
publicity surrounding the case 
i really didnt know what to expect scott said 
the jurors and alternates are to be sworn in friday superior 
court judge michael dann ruled 
mecham could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted of all 
six felony counts of perjury willful concealment and filing false 
documents willard mecham who was his brothers 1986 campaign 
treasurer faces three similar counts and up to 9 years in prison 
if convicted 
the former republican governor was removed from office april 4 
when the senate convicted him on two unrelated impeachment counts 
he also had been impeached in connection with the 350000 loan 
but the senate did not hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his 
criminal trial 
thirteen of 37 possible jurors questioned during two days were 
eliminated for showing signs of bias or personal conflicts 
mecham asked whether he was pleased with the jury pool joked 
that he would have liked to include several of those who were 
eliminated but he declined to comment further 
mecham and his brother have denied all wrongdoing in their 
failure to list the 350000 loan from a tempe developer on 
financial reports required by the state they contended it was 
properly reported as part of a 465000 lump sum listed as a 
contribution from mecham 
on june 1 the arizona supreme court is to hear oral arguments 
on a defense motion to return the charges to the state grand jury 
for a new determination of probable causee 
among the jurors struck from the pool by the prosecutor was a 
woman who said tuesday she thought mechams personality was one of 
arrogance of sureness of himself and that he had an inability 
to admit error 
one woman accepted for the panel said she believed mecham was 
honest adding i like the man i had nothing against him as 
governor

proposed deep cuts in nasas budget 
could kill americas space station reducing the nation to a 
second or thirdrate space power the space agencys head warns 
without the space station the us manned space flight 
program would be deadended and americas leadership in space 
would be put on hold indefinitely james c fletcher said 
wednesday as he spoke to a group of reporters attending briefings 
on us space goals 
the reagan administration has asked congress to give nasa 115 
billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 an increase of 27 
percent over the current budget 
however key lawmakers have said the agency can expect no more 
than 107 billion a house budget resolution would slash that to 
102 billion 
the administration has asked for 967 million to continue space 
station development earlier cuts already have delayed the program 
three years current plans call for putting people in the orbiting 
laboratory in late 1995 
fletcher speaking from washington said that if the budget were 
reduced to 102 billion nasa would have to recommend killing 
the space station 
the result he said could be reduction of the united states 
to a secondrate or even a thirdrate power in space 
fletcher said the station is needed to support space research 
and to prepare humans for deeper excursions into space perhaps to 
build a moon base or to mount an expedition to mars 
asked how much money it would take to continue the space station 
next year the administrator replied the house has reported out 
900 million unless we get close to that figure i wonder if it 
would be worth going ahead with the space station 
fletcher said most members of congress favor a strong space 
program but when it comes to balancing the space station with 
their favorite programs in the present budget climate it is a hard 
choice to make 
he said cancellation of the space station would have a 
devastating effect on the space programs of the europeans and 
the canadians who have invested 1 billion and are planning to 
double that to develop modules and other equipment for the us 
facility 
fletcher said a steep budget reduction would also lead to a drop 
in the number of space shuttle flights after launches resume now 
scheduled for late august nasa plans seven launches next year 
building up to 14 a year by 1994 
he said the soviets have been gathering valuable flight 
experience over several years with their salyut space station and 
with the new mir station 
there is no doubt the russians are far ahead of us in moving 
out into space fletcher said

a 24yearold computer whiz and his 
mother apparently tried to commit suicide after authorities closed 
the budding millionaires company and seized its assets police say 
tex zachary hildreth and his 50yearold mother rose were in 
serious condition today at elliot hospital said nursing supervisor 
laurie king 
hildreth left the braintree mass area just before his 
5yearold computer services company massdata corp was closed by 
authorities and its assets were seized tuesday he left behind 
about 30 angry employees and irked investors 
hildreth was arrested as a fugitive here tuesday after a holiday 
inn employee called police to report a bloodied man wandering in 
the lobby police found hildreths mother lying injured in the room 
the two shared 
police lt william bovaird said it appeared hildreth may have 
slashed his wrists a bottle of nonprescription pills was found in 
the hotel room along with what appeared to be suicide notes 
bovaird said 
both hildreths were incoherent the lieutenant said 
massdata was closed monday when the rockland trust co which 
was owed more than 400000 tried to seize its assets said senior 
vice president john oconnor 
norfolk county mass authorities and state police secured 
massdatas offices tuesday night 
the county district attorneys office began investigating 
hildreth on tuesday after receiving complaints from several people 
who said they did business with him said spokesman mike mcgorty 
police in the boston suburb of weymouth charged hildreth with 
larceny of more than 250 on the same day after receiving another 
complaint mcgorty said hildreth collapsed in his office on his 
24th birthday may 18 suffering what was described as an aneurysm 
a dangerous weakening of a blood vessel his father died of an 
aneurysm when hildreth was 7 
employees became suspicious last friday when massdatas 
president told them their paychecks were being withheld because 
hildreth had not signed them mcgorty said the investigation into 
hildreths business dealings was expected to be lengthy 
but there were signs of unusual behavior before this week the 
boston herald reported wednesday that hildreth often tried to trick 
employees into believing that new york real estate tycoon donald 
trump called to chat 
employees said hildreth would disguise his voice and call 
himself pretending to be trump then would leave the office door 
open as he conducted an imaginary conversation 
hildreth transformed himself from an overweight unhappy 
teenager into a budding millionaire just a few years out of high 
school according to a profile last month in the boston globe 
after buying his first computer at age 16 he began writing 
computer programs the confidence he gained prompted him to lose 
115 pounds in less than two years 
with the help of a mentor in the braintree area hildreth rented 
office space at the age of 20 and went into business as a computer 
consultant he gradually built up his business hiring young 
computer experts from other companies 
hildreth rapidly acquired symbols of success a 220000 
weymouth condominium a 32000 bmw and a 50inch 4000 color tv 
his mother who once lived with him in subsidized housing and 
worked as a lunch matron at his school was made clerk of the 
company 
the company had more than 300 clients an employee told the 
herald 
massdata turned profitable in 1987 and predicted sales of about 
4 million this year the globe said 
last november hildreth accompanied by a beautiful woman 
arrived in a limousine for the fifth reunion of his braintree high 
school class 
this was my revenge for four years of hell he said at the 
time

transportation officials in this 
trafficclogged region have approved a 20mile railway they say 
would be the nations first fully automated driverless trolley 
line 
the los angeles county transportation commission unanimously 
adopted the proposal wednesday despite a critics contention that 
the system would be bureaucratfriendly technologyfriendly but 
not userfriendly 
what turned me around was other successful automated 
systems that have worked astoundingly well said commissioner 
jacki bacharach who heads the commissions rail construction 
committee and has studied such lines in london vancouver british 
columbia and lille france 
commission chairman pete schabarum said the automated system is 
a technology whose time has come and he called for a 
commitment for automation throughout the system from now on 
the project requires a 50 million investment above the 344 
million that was originally estimated for the 20mile line along 
the century freeway between el segundo and norwalk which is about 
10 miles southeast of downtown los angeles 
until recently the commission had intended to use manually 
controlled trolleys which would be powered by overhead wires 
commissioner ray grabinski said the new system will be the first 
fully automated driverless trolley line in the country 
proponents say the driverless system would prove more efficient 
by running smaller trains more often and save money by replacing 
highly paid operators with lowerpaid attendants who would roam the 
cars 
more frequent service all day long builds ridership and 
farebox revenue ms bacharach said 
critics however said the automated trolleys would be the third 
type of rail car to become part of the countys multibillion dollar 
mass transit system along with cars to be used for the metro rail 
subway now under construction and a manned light rail system 
proposed between los angeles and long beach 
none of the cars would be compatible and riders would be forced 
to transfer for example a commuter going from the san fernando 
valley to los angeles international airport would have to ride four 
lines and transfer three times 
as long as they design it so you have to get on and get off 
its never going to be userfriendly said state assemblyman 
richard katz this is a system that is bureacratfriendly 
technologyfriendly but not userfriendly 
however the compatibility of the trolley with other transit 
systems was not viewed as a problem by the commission said erica 
goebel a commission spokeswoman 
passenger studies show that passengers who have to transfer 
from one line to another dont consider that as any kind of a 
barrier ms goebel said its all part of the ride

an unfortunate mixup in the growth of the brain 
before birth may be responsible for autism according to research 
published today 
researchers who made scans of victims brains found that one 
structure buried deep within the head is often poorly developed 
while this may not be the sole cause of autism it could help 
explain many of the weird and stubborn symptoms of this illness 
dr eric courchesne and colleagues from childrens hospital 
research center in san diego pinpointed the abnormality in a region 
of the cerebellum which lies at the base of the skull this 
structure helps control movement learning and some kinds of 
behavior 
it supports the idea that this is something that happens early 
in development said dr margaret bauman of harvard medical 
school 
autism usually becomes apparent early in childhood victims are 
withdrawn and often mute frequently they move and walk oddly 
become obsessed with mechanical objects and are overly sensitive to 
sounds and other distractions the disorder occurs in about five of 
every 10000 people 
courchesne whose study was published in the new england journal 
of medicine that in some people with autism a part of the 
cerebellum known as the vermis is undersized he studied 18 people 
and in 14 of them the vermis was 25 percent smaller than usual 
he said he believes that the defect exists in a majority of 
autistic people and probably occurs before birth as the brain takes 
shape inside the womb 
until this study it was unknown whether or not autism had an 
anatomical or chemical basis courchesne said this kind of 
evidence makes it clear that at least in a substantial subset of 
autism the disorder is in fact anatomical 
if the newly found abnormality turns out to be a cause of 
autism the discovery could open new approaches for treating the 
disorder which is incurable 
however many experts believe that autism is actually a group of 
similarlooking diseases so no single problem is likely to explain 
all cases of the disorder 
this is potentially a very important finding because it would 
represent a way to assist the diagnosis and also has implications 
as to what might be the cause and the timing of the insult to the 
brain said dr edward r ritvo of the university of california 
los angeles 
courchesne said the defect he discovered could be just one of 
many injuries suffered by the brains of autistic people before 
birth if so it might not be the key injury that underlies autism 
however he said it is possible that this damage is 
responsible for some of the symptoms of autism the cerebellum is 
in a position to disrupt or affect mechanisms involved in attention 
and various kinds of learning and to alter the activity of several 
major neurotransmitter systems of brain chemicals 
the researchers used magnetic resonance scanning which produces 
crosssection pictures of the head to pinpoint the difference 
between autistic brains and those of normal people 
bauman said the defect that courchesne found is too subtle for 
scanning to be used routinely to diagnose autism 
she and ritvo also have found abnormalities in specific cells 
called purkinje cells in the brains of autism victims after death 
i think the cerebellum is playing a role she said but i 
think there are other parts of the brain that are also involved 
such as the limbic system which has something to do with memory i 
hope people will not say that the problem is now solved 
in an accompanying editorial drs fred r volkmar and donald j 
cohen of yale called the report particularly interesting but 
they cautioned that the number of patients tested was small and 
their brain defect might not be typical of autism victims

the soviet navy operates close to home in part 
because the kremlin does not trust its sailors and fears defections 
by naval personnel according to the editor of the new janes 
fighting ships 
richard sharpe also said the us navy is so much stronger than 
western europes forces that washington is finding it harder and 
harder to work with its allies at sea 
the new edition of the prestigious reference book was released 
wednesday 
sharpe a recently retired royal navy captain recalled passing 
a soviet cruiser in the english channel he said that while almost 
the entire crew of the british warship lined its decks on the 
soviet vessel just one young sailor was visible above deck 
i dont think the politburo trusts its navy and that is one of 
the reasons why we see so few ships of the soviet fleet ranging the 
waters of the world sharpe said 
he also said the soviet union keeps its navy bottled up because 
moscow sees its fleet as fulfilling an essentially defensive role 
indeed this hypothesis is now so widely accepted that the 
latest us naval policy envisages entering soviet home waters 
during a war said sharpe 
but despite such a visibly wimpish soviet policy at sea the 
soviet fleet is capable of a swift breakout into the vulnerable 
sea lanes of the western world he said 
pointing to the recent buildup of us naval forces sharpe 
called the us navy rejuvenated and formidable 
but he said such improvements have made coordination with 
americas weaker allies more difficult 
the united states is more and more operating on its own and is 
going to find it harder and harder to ally with the nato forces on 
this side of the atlantic sharpe told a news conference on 
tuesday 
in times of trouble sharpe said the us navy would probably 
not wait to consult with nato and subordinate itself to a 
polyglot talking shop of the brussels variety brussels is the 
headquarters of the 16nation north american treaty organization 
sharpe noted us navy commanders publicly deny a goitalone 
policy but he maintained this policy is what has developed because 
of us naval superiority and slow decisionmaking by nato 
every navy now operates in the shadow of the huge fleets of 
the superpowers he said 
but despite soviet naval advances including development of 
quieter submarines sharpe said the us navy still has the edge 
because of its bettertrained personnel

the protein deficiency that triggers a rare form 
of muscular dystrophy has been pinpointed according to a study 
that an expert called a key victory in finding the causes of 
the crippling disease of children 
the research was conducted by dr louis m kunkel and colleagues 
at childrens hospital in boston and reported in todays new 
england journal of medicine 
they found that the disorder is caused by problems with the 
muscle protein called dystrophin becker muscular dystrophy results 
if the body produces too little of the protein or makes an abnormal 
form of it 
weve scored another key victory in uncovering the causes of 
muscular dystrophy learning what must be set right to cure these 
devastating diseases said dr s mouchly small president of the 
muscular dystrophy association in new york 
in december kunkel and his colleagues reported that a more 
common form of the disease called duchennes musclar dystrophy 
occurs when the protein is absent two years ago kunkels team 
reported the discovery of the gene responsible for duchennes and 
becker muscular dystrophy 
duchennes muscular dystrophy occurs in one in 3300 births 
while becker muscular dystrophy strikes one in 30000 births 
both forms strike males almost exclusively and result in 
progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles 
the protein abnormalities in both forms result from an inborn 
genetic defect genes contain the code that instruct the body to 
make all the proteins necessary for life

an accident of history made him mayor for a 
week but now david orr is facing the reality of politics 
just a day after his photograph was unveiled on city halls 
wall of mayors orr was dumped wednesday as vice mayor by the 
city council on a 3115 vote 
the action was apparently a retaliation for his demands for 
better accounting among council members 
orr 43 a democrat known as a strong proponent of ethics 
legislation was thrust into the spotlight as acting mayor when 
harold washington died of a heart attack nov 25 orr held the 
mayors job just seven days before the council in a raucous 
allnight session elected eugene sawyer to succeed washington orr 
had not sought the post 
but in presiding over that council meeting orr angered some 
sawyer supporters who thought he delayed calling for a vote his 
support in the council continued to erode as council members 
objected to his persistent call for more controls over the way they 
spend their money 
in mondays chicago tribune orr repeated his view that council 
members should be more accountable for their 18000 continency 
funds and for their travel and office expenses currently they are 
not required to disclose how that money is spent 
everything he has done has been done to demean us to make 
us out to be thieves ignoramuses and lowlifes fumed alderwoman 
anna langford he has to tell us how to run the council 
orr however said he will continue to push for accountability 
despite his ouster 
this is only going to invigorate me he said im 
absolutely convinced that the majority of the people of chicago 
support me in some ways im honored to be dumped by some of 
these folks 
orr said he didnt know whether sawyer also a democrat 
actively supported his ouster but added that he believes the 
current administration is weak 
alderman terry gabinski was named to succeed orr as vice mayor 
a post considered mainly ceremonial 
orr taught history and urban affairs at mundelein college before 
he defeated three challengers to win election to the city council 
in 1979 his support for ethics legislation matched the agenda of 
washington who made him vice mayor in 1986 as washington began 
building his council base 
being mayor orr said was kind of an accident of history and 
im really proud of what i did 
i fought for religious and racial tolerance and city council 
accountability he said 
orrs ouster came a day after his photograph was unveiled on the 
wall of mayors outside sawyers fifthfloor office 
he still was mayor sawyer told reporters when asked why 
orrs picture should join the honored group it is extremely 
welldeserved whats fair is fair

a promotional firm in decatur ill 
thought it had finished its research when it asked 11 other 
decaturs around the country to compete in a contest to raise food 
for the needy 
but it missed decatur ny 
however the 312 citizens of the central new york village say 
they arent insulted since theyre used to being overlooked 
im not surprised said town supervisor gary hughes we 
dont show in the rand mcnally atlas 
a group called decatur advantage came up with the idea of 
challenging the countrys decaturs to see which one could collect 
the most cans of food for the poor based on percentage of 
population 
after poring through atlases the illinois group found decaturs 
in alabama arkansas georgia indiana michigan mississippi 
nebraska tennessee and texas they also found decatur counties in 
iowa and kansas said jan cook a spokeswoman for decatur advantage 
but they didnt spot decatur ny 
its nice to know theres another one out there cook said 
we didnt mean to forget you 
the nebraska decatur with 723 people was thought to be the 
smallest of the communities but the central new york villages 
population is less than half that the largest decatur ill has 
more than 94000 people 
hughes said hes not surprised his town was overlooked after 
all he said it doesnt even have a zip code its downtown 
consists of 10 houses and the only way to find it is look at a 
townbytown map of the state 
the official competition between decaturs starts friday and runs 
through aug 3 cook said hughes said hed like to see more 
information before committing the otsego county village to the 
contest

a judge ordered a convicted sex offender to 
submit to a test for the aids virus over the objections of the 
mans attorney who called it an invasion of privacy 
attorney robert gombiner said he would advise client steven g 
farmer not to comply with the order by king county superior court 
judge charles johnson and said he would appeal 
johnson ruled tuesday that farmer 34 should receive the test 
before sentencing june 7 
the former flight attendant was convicted last month of two 
counts of patronizing a teenage male prostitute and two counts of 
sexual exploitation of a minor 
deputy prosecutor rebecca roe said that if the test is positive 
she would seek a 10year sentence for farmer the normal maximum 
sentence for the crime is three years and seven months 
ms roe contended farmer knew he had tested positive for the 
virus that can cause aids when he had contact with young male 
prostitutes 
she said that if farmer resists the order she will seek a 
warrant to take the blood by force in the county jail 
johnson said the test results would be supplied only to the 
court and to lawyers 
it is a patently illegal order said gombiner if your 
honor wants to hold us in contempt you can but i am telling mr 
farmer he is not to comply with this order 
he said the ruling violated farmers right to privacy 
especially in light of a state law enacted this year that restricts 
such examinations 
there is no godgiven right for the state to go around 
sticking needles in people and taking out little vials of blood 
gombiner said 
he said he would ask the state court of appeals to stay 
johnsons order and review the ruling 
aids which damages the bodys immune system and leaves victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer is spread through sexual 
contact it is also spread through needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring

an exhibition of works by 34 soviet artists that 
is touring europe shows russian painters are doing work as lively 
innovative and often as strange as anything done in the west 
the 35 paintings which will be sold in july at the first 
international art auction in moscow since the 1917 russian 
revolution are being shown in europe to attract bidders 
the tour and the sale introduce the excellence of modern 
soviet painting to western collectors as well as offering more 
familiar works of the avantgarde period that followed the 
revolution said simon de pury managing director of the 23 
european offices of sothebys auction house 
the works were shown in new york earlier this month and have 
just been displayed at sothebys in london for three days they 
will be seen in paris today and friday in cologne may 31june 3 
and in zurich june 915 before returning to moscow 
in one painting by ilya glazunov a glowing scene depicts an 
old russian city with monks and onionshaped church domes 
surmounted by modern buildings and a redflag procession 
another by svetlana kopystianskaya is comprised of a blue 
crumpled cloth in a box mysteriously titled dialogue n2 
ilya kabakov paints words on his canvases one of his works 
titled where are you consists of 36 sheets of paper with words 
on them each page signed and dated and contained in a box 
from 1928 when dictator josef stalin achieved supreme power 
there were two kinds of soviet art the official one that glorified 
the state and the unofficial one which didnt and was practised 
behind the scenes 
under the new policy the distinction between official 
and unofficial art is no longer being made by the ministry of 
culture de pury said 
he helped select the works for auction after getting to know the 
artists during moscow visits to arrange loans of pictures when he 
was curator of baron heinrich thyssenbornemiszas famous picture 
collection in lugano switzerland 
the auction was negotiated with the soviet culture ministry by 
lord gowrie sothebys chairman in britain and a former arts 
minister and art dealer most of the sale works are in the 3700 
to 9300 price range a few run up to 22000 to 28000 
there is a strong emphasis on abstraction and fractured images 
in the pictures but there are also portraits and dreamy views of 
the land and cities 
the london showing drew a large number of viewers 
some of our visitors asked if we had been taken over by the 
russians said a sothebys receptionist as a banner with the 
firms name in cyrillic letters was taken down from the building

new laws to combat discrimination of roman 
catholics in northern irelands job market will force companies to 
report annually on how many catholics and protestants they employ 
but the measures the government proposed on wednesday stop short 
of imposing hiring quotas from among the 40 percent catholic 
minority northern ireland secretary tom king said that would be 
inflammatory 
the laws expected to be enacted by parliament and take effect 
in mid1989 mark the toughest attempt to end job discrimination in 
britishrun northern ireland where catholic unemployment runs at 
2 times the protestant rate 
the measures were spurred partly by threats of disinvestment 
from the united states an antidiscrimination tactic the british 
government calls misguided 
seven american states have endorsed fair employment principles 
put forward in 1984 by the late irish statesman sean macbride that 
call for disinvestment measures against companies in northern 
ireland accused of religious bias 
several more states are expected to follow suit american 
investment accounts for nearly 14 percent of the jobs in northern 
ireland 
under the new laws companies with more than 25 employees and 
later with 10 or more will have to submit annual reports on the 
religious composition of the workforce to a new body the fair 
employment commission failure to do so will be a criminal offense 
punishable by a fine of up to 3720 
the laws would also ban indirect discrimination in hiring 
practices such as taking recruits from a single school catholics 
and protestant children are educated separately or getting 
current employees to find new workers 
the commission replacing a watchdog body set up in 1976 will 
have powers to order companies to recruit from a wider area such 
as advertising in catholic publications 
companies that ignore commission directives could be charged 
with contempt of court and denied government contracts 
northern ireland is among the most economically depressed 
regions of the united kingdom the provinces unemployment rate of 
174 percent is double the national average 
the social democratic labor party the provinces main moderate 
catholic party criticized the moves as not being tough enough 
alasdair maclaughlin director of the confederation of british 
industry in northern ireland said the employers organization was 
concerned about the way in which targets and timetables are to be 
used 
it will be essential that both government and the fair 
employment commission on a continuing basis make it crystal clear 
that the object of the legislation is not to create or impose 
quotas he said 
in london the opposition labor partys spokesman on northern 
ireland kevin mcnamara said the lack of any targets to judge the 
success of the proposed legislation was a government copout

the jail terms given two princeton 
university students for their role in initiation parties that 
prompted 46 students to seek medical attention for overdrinking 
were excessive the schools president says 
kenneth simpler 20 of rehoboth beach del and lisa 
napolitano 21 of geneva ny were each sentenced to 30 days in 
jail and a 500 fine wednesday 
simpler a junior who is president of the charter club and ms 
napolitano a junior who is the university eating clubs former 
social chairman were convicted may 18 of serving alcoholic 
beverages to minors in february 
municipal court judge russell annich said wednesday he did not 
consider the incident a college prank that got out of hand 
im not aware of a similar event that has produced as many 
casualties said annich it is a violation of the law 
he delayed the start of the sentences so attorneys could appeal 
princeton president harold shapiro said he was shocked to hear 
the students will have to serve jail sentences 
while the incidents in question are certainly serious in 
nature the penalty seems to me clearly disproportionate and 
excessive shapiro said 
the initiation parties feb 6 by the charter club and the 
cloister inn two of 13 fraternitylike eating clubs on campus 
resulted in 39 students going to the universitys mccosh infirmary 
and seven requiring treatment at the medical center at princeton 
many of the students were underage new jerseys legal drinking 
age is 21 
simpler and ms napolitano were convicted after a oneday trial 
in which witnesses testified that students seeking to join the club 
were blindfolded and led from room to room as club members poured 
drinks down their throats 
james martin 20 the social chairman of the cloister inn 
previously agreed to plead guilty to a disorderly persons offense 
charges against two other cloister inn officers were dismissed for 
lack of evidence 
defense attorney kim otis called the jail penalty totally 
inappropriate 
we argued that there was selective prosecution and this is 
selective sentencing this is scapegoating otis said 
but prosecutor michael barrett said if we had information that 
pointed a finger at other people we would have pursued it 
the case was one of two major drinking incidents at new jersey 
universities 
aggravated hazing charges stemming from the drinkingrelated 
death of an 18yearold fraternity pledge have been filed against 
15 rutgers university students including seven officers of the 
nowclosed lambda chi alpha fraternity

south africa and mozambique have 
revived a nonaggression pact that lapsed three years ago agreeing 
not to support guerrilla movements operating in each others 
territory 
the agreement reached wednesday between ranking diplomats and 
military officials of the two neighbors was the latest in a series 
of recent developments signaling an easing of hostilities 
the two sides said in a statement that they would reactivate 
meetings of a joint security commission at the earliest possible 
date 
the commission was established under the 1984 nkomati accord a 
nonaggression treaty in which each country pledged to halt support 
for guerrillas fighting against the other government 
although technically still in effect the treaty has been 
ignored since 1985 when mozambique found documents indicating 
south africa was violating the agreement through continued aid to 
the mozambican rebels 
since then the main source of friction between the countries 
has been mozambiques persistent charge that south africa has 
continued covert assistance to the mozambique national resistance 
rebel movement 
south africa denies the charge 
the war has devastated mozambiques economy and is the main 
cause of a nationwide famine that has left nearly 6 million of the 
countrys 145 million people in need of food aid 
wednesdays statement said the two delegations affirmed the 
commitments of their respective governments not to support the 
commission of violence against the peoples of their respective 
countries 
no date was announced for the security commission to meet but 
both sides have appeared eager in recent weeks to improve relations 
south africa has offered logistical aid to help protect a 
mozambican hydroelectric project from rebel saboteurs and the 
chairman of south africas largest conglomerate visited maputo to 
discuss possible investment 
in addition officials of both countries say a summit meeting 
may be arranged between their presidents south africas pw botha 
and mozambiques joaquim chissano 
mozambiques delegation at wednesdays talks was headed by the 
army commander lt gen tobais dai south africas delegation was 
led by the directorgeneral of the foreign affairs department niel 
van heerden and included the army chief lt gen aj liebenberg

possibility of a heart attack trindidad said 
more tests were ordered for today to determine if a lung ailment 
caused the chest pains that led marcos to enter the hospital 
tuesday night he said 
marcos staff stationed guards in the intensive care unit and at 
every entrance to the hospital 
marcos wife imelda said in a radio interview aired in manila 
that the former president is suffering because he has not been 
allowed to return home 
tomas gomez philippine consul general to hawaii dismissed the 
pains as an attempt on the part of marcos to return to his homeland 
for the funeral of his mother josefa edralinmarcos who died may 
4 at the age of 95 
i think these are charades these chest pains are not 
substantiated medically gomez said the problem i have with 
mr marcos is you never know when hes telling the truth 
president corazon aquino saying marcos continues to pose a 
threat the national security of the philippines has refused to 
lift the ban on his return which she imposed in 1986 after he fled 
into exile here 
marcos quest to return home drew support from several 
philippine politicians 
this is going to create another problem if marcos comes home 
in a box said sen ernesto maceda now is the time for the 
government to act to allow him to return

vietnam will withdraw 50000 troops 
from cambodia by the end of the year and will pull out all its 
forces by 1990 the official cambodian spk news agency said today 
the soviet news agency tass reporting from hanoi also reported 
the pullout announcement 
spk quoted a communique from the ministry of national defense as 
saying the soldiers would be returning home from june to december 
remaining troops will be placed under the command of the 
provietnamese cambodian government spk said 
a 50000troop pullout would be by far the largest of six 
partial withdrawals vietnam claims to have made since 1982 
about 20000 troops returned home in the most recent and largest 
withdrawal last november the united states says that was the only 
genuine withdrawal and it estimates that 120000125000 
vietnamese troops remain in the country battling about 50000 
guerrillas 
spk monitored in bangkok said that over the past nine years 
the cambodian government has gradually undertaken the defense 
work by itself thus creating the conditions for six annual 
withdrawals of vietnamese volunteer troops from kampuchea 
cambodia 
this time the command of the vietnamese volunteer army in 
kampuchea will also be pulled out from kampuchea and the remaining 
vietnamese troops in kampuchea are to be placed under the command 
of the peoples republic of kampuchea until their complete 
withdrawal in 1990 
the announcement followed word on the vietnamese pullout by a 
senior vietnamese foreign ministry official wednesday to a group of 
foreign diplomats in hanoi a western diplomat in bangkok said 
today 
the diplomat quoting a cable from his countrys embassy in 
hanoi said he had no other details he gave the information on 
condition of anonymity 
the development came before sundays start of the moscow summit 
at which president reagan has said he will ask soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev to encourage the vietnamese to resolve the 
cambodian conflict 
the sovietarmed vietnamese invaded cambodia in late 1978 and 
are fighting guerrillas backed militarily or diplomatically by 
china noncommunist southeast asian countries and the united 
states 
hanoi had warned it will take unspecified action if the 
guerrillas take advantage of the pullout to try to return to power 
the strategy of the khmer rouge the largest of the guerrilla 
groups has been to gain control of villages and wait for the 
vietnamese to withdraw in 1990 
the western diplomat said the vietnamese were moving into the 
interior of the country leaving the phnom penh forces to guard the 
thai border area the traditional area of fighting 
earlier this week reagan said in response to written questions 
from reporters from southeast asian countries that he would raise 
the cambodian issue in moscow 
foreign minister siddhi savetsila of thailand quoted soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze as telling him last week in 
moscow that the kremlin would talk to the vietnamese about ending 
their occupation of cambodia 
that could represent a significant change of position the 
soviets previously stated they have no direct role to play in the 
conflict and that vietnam is a sovereign country whose policies the 
kremlin cannot influence 
in exchange for rights at vietnams numerous military bases the 
soviet union gives vietnam several billion dollars a year in aid

immediately close two dumps has been reached in a legal battle over 
the regulation and disposal of hazardous waste from the savannah 
river nuclear weapons plant 
under the agreement the federal energy department must close 
two major hazardous waste dumps at the government plant and begin 
developing detailed plans for closing and monitoring three others 
the department also agreed the south carolina department of 
health and environmental control should have an active role in 
regulating hazardous waste facilities at the savannah river plant 
a concession the state had sought for years 
the agreement submitted for approval this week to us district 
judge charles e simons jr was signed by the federal and state 
agency and a coalition of environmental groups that had sued in 
1985 over the handling of hazardous waste at the plant 
james chandler a lawyer for the environmental groups said the 
agreement will lead to a cleaner environment at the facility and 
make the savannah river plant more accountable to state and federal 
laws 
the savannah river plant produces plutonium and tritium for 
nuclear weapons

striking scriptwriters again failed to come 
to terms with producers on residual payments from reruns but agreed 
to another bargaining session this weekend in the 12weekold 
walkout 
negotiators for the writers guild of america also rejected a 
proposal by the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
to extend the proposed contract from three years to four said wga 
executive director brian walton 
however wednesdays fivehour bargaining session conducted by 
a federal mediator ended with agreement to meet again saturday 
the 9000 tv and film writers went on strike march 7 over 
creative control and residuals 
the walkout cut the tv season short for many shows and is 
expected to delay the start of the fall season it has also delayed 
countless movie projects 
the guild also announced it would take a membership vote tonight 
to approve several independent contracts with tv production 
companies 
as of wednesday afternoon walton said 39 companies had signed 
contracts with the union 
among the companies he said were those producing its garry 
shandlings show the tonight show starring johnny carson 
alien productions which makes alf kenny rogers productions 
henson amp associations which makes the muppets and the 
production company for days and nights of molly dodd 
late night with david letterman agreed to an asyetunsigned 
contract this week union president george kirgo said 
producers spokesman herb steinberg said the contracts represent 
less than 10 percent of all film production and less than 15 
percent of tv production 
wed rather put 4000 writers back to work than 400 he said 
during wednesdays negotiations producers proposed a formula 
for onehour primetime shows sold into syndication based on the 
premise that such shows are selling poorly 
they rejected the numbers but not the concept steinberg 
said 
under the formula which the producers have offered twice and 
the writers have rejected twice the producers proposed to drop a 
fixed residual schedule and pay writers based on a shows success 
in syndication 
producers said writers could earn as much as 150 percent more 
than under their present pay schedule 
the producers alliance said in a statement that the offer would 
meet the fixed residual requirement of the wga while satisfying 
amptp objectives of having a market price sensitive formula the 
release didnt detail the offer

an arab assailant sneaked up behind a jewish 
seminary student in a perfume market today and stabbed him in the 
back police said 
the victim was hospitalized and identified as the son of an 
israeli government lawyer who handled land confiscation cases in 
the occupied territories but authorities said they believed the 
attack was random 
police said another jewish man was stabbed to death later today 
in the predominantly jewish neighborhood of katamon which borders 
an arab village israel radio quoted police as saying they believed 
it was a criminal act not motivated by ethnic politics the 
neighborhood is a poor area with a high crime rate 
the army lifted curfews imposed in parts of the occupied 
territories after palestinians defied the restrictions and called a 
general strike to commemorate slain plo leader khalil wazir 
curfews remained in effect in a village and a refugee camp in 
the occupied west bank 
foreign minister shimon peres meanwhile said the 24weekold 
arab uprising has made peace more elusive but reiterated that 
israel must vigorously pursue negotiations with its arab neighbors 
since the dec 8 start of the uprising 195 palestinians have 
been killed and hundreds wounded two israelis have died 
witnesses identified the first stabbing victim as chanoch 
albeck justice ministry officials said he was the son of plea 
albeck who has handled land confiscation cases in the occupied 
territories for the government 
jerusalem police spokesmen said the 16yearold victim was 
attacked from behind by a single arab assailant as he walked 
through the perfume market a narrow lane in the moslem quarter 
apparently on his way to a seminary in the adjacent jewish quarter 
of the city 
several arabs were immediately detained for questioning and 
police launched wide searches in the area said spokesman alex 
lapidot 
a police source said it appeared unlikely that albeck was 
targeted and that investigators believed the attack was random 
in a statement jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said he was 
shocked and disgusted the arab public in jerusalem must 
understand that such actions in the end will only hurt the arabs 
albeck who wore a black yarmulka was rushed by ambulance to 
nearby hadassah hospital with the knife sticking out of his back 
after two other seminary students helped him to the jewish quarter 
police and witnesses said 
he had a knife in the upper part of his back the entire knife 
was inside merchant alex yosipo told israel radio he said he 
was alone when it happened that he was stabbed and didnt know by 
whom there was apparently no scuffle he was simply stabbed 
the radio said a witness to the attack identified as rami 
shebach said he tried in vain to chase down the arab assailant 
a hospital official reached by telephone said the youth was 
being treated in the intensive care unit and declined to give 
further details 
the last attack on an israeli in the old city was last october 
when a 24year old man was fatally shot in the head 
on wednesday a plomandated general strike shut down 
transportation and commerce in the west bank gaza and arab east 
jerusalem an army curfew confined 200000 arabs to their homes in 
the gaza strip and the west bank 
the strike was called to mark the end of mourning for wazir the 
plo military commander assassinated april 16 at his home outside 
tunis tunisia 
wazir whose code name was abu jihad spent his boyhood in gaza 
city israeli sources said israel security forces were responsible 
for his death the israeli government has not commented on the case 
by early today all curfews were lifted in gaza but two 
remained in effect in the west banks dheishe refugee camp and the 
village of shuweika army officials said 
on wednesday despite the curfews scattered antiisraeli 
protests occurred leaving at least six arabs hurt 
peres remarks were aimed at his political rival prime minister 
yitzhak shamir who has said israel should not enter peace talks 
until calm has returned to the occupied territories 
i think its more difficult today peres leader of the 
leftist labor party told israel television wednesday night the 
road to peace is full of obstacles full of disappointments but 
what is the alternative to let the situation deteriorate 
peres responding to a question told israel television he was 
concerned about possible human rights violations in the occupied 
territories but did not elaborate

taxicabs public restrooms polling places and public meeting 
halls bars hotels and private meeting rooms are exempt 
figueroa said the ordinance carries fines ranging from 25 to

the offspring of the baby boomers are 
continuing their sharp increase of recent years the census bureau 
reported today 
the number of americans aged 5 and under totaled 183 million as 
of 1987 up from 182 million in 1986 and just over 18 million the 
year before that 
still the total is well short of the 205 million preschoolers 
recorded in 1961 near the end of the post world war ii baby boom 
population experts stress that the current surge in tots does 
not constitute another boom but rather is an echo of that 
earlier one since the great mass of people born in the two decades 
following that war are now producing their own families 
this increase has been underway for several years with the 
number of americans under age 5 up by 19 million from 1980 to 1987 
meanwhile the number aged 5 to 17 has declined in this decade 
slipping from 474 million in 1980 to 453 million in the 1987 
estimates 
in the same period those aged 18 to 24 declined from 300 
million to 271 million while all other age groups increased 
other findings of the study included 
alaska and louisiana both registered population losses for the 
first time in this decade as the continuing slowdown in the energy 
industry affected growth rates in several states declines 
continued in west virginia oklahoma and wyoming 
population loss also affected agricultural states with 
declines reported for iowa north dakota and nebraska

a syrian official said syria and a 
proiranian militia reached an agreement to stop fighting today in 
the southern suburbs of beirut 
but gunners from the proiranian hezbollah or party of god and 
the syrianaided amal continued fighting sporadically with mortars 
howitzers and tank cannons on the 21st day of struggle for the 
slums where 18 foreign hostages are believed held 
another report in the leftist beirut daily assafir said a 
solution to the conflict has been delayed because secret 
negotiations on the fate of the american hostages in particular 
have not reached a definite result 
nine of the foreign hostages are americans 
the syrian official speaking on condition of anonymity in 
damuscus said ending the fighting will create new hope for the 
hostages and syria will spare no effort to secure their release 
regardless of their nationality 
the official did not give details of the agreement but said it 
had been agreed to by all parties including iran and amal after a 
meeting between president hafez assad of syria and hezbollah 
leaders late wednesday 
hezbollah is a group of moslem shiite fundamentalists in lebanon 
believed to be an umbrella for smaller organizations holding the 
foreign hostages

has about 7500 troops 100 tanks and 400 armored units ringing the 
16squaremile warren of narrow alleyways and cement shanties 
where nearly 300 persons have been killed in the fighting 
syrian officials also have been negotiating with hezbollah and 
iranian officials including two deputy foreign ministers to work 
out a plan for syrian troop deployment to bring security to the 
southern suburbs 
syrian sources have said that they were willing to use force if 
necessary but it was only a last option 
threats to kill hostages if the syrians used force have been 
reported the syrians have said any action against the hostages 
would be considered an act against syria 
the battle between amal and hezbollah over control of the 
southern suburbs has created tension between iran and syria which 
is irans only major arab ally in its 7yearold war with iraq 
israeli planes today attacked amal and hezbollah positions in 
south lebanon today it followed ground attacks by israeliallied 
militiamen on two villages wednesday

unidentified diplomatic sources as saying serious negotiations 
are being held between washington and tehran and some 
iranianallied groups on the nine american hostages

leading soviet officials today called for burying 
the corpse of the cold war and lauded president reagan for his 
pledge to come to next weeks summit in search of peace 
they said the meetings could produce important advances in 
negotiations toward a treaty to cut us and soviet longrange 
nuclear arsenals by 50 percent 
one official asserted ussoviet relations had warmed because 
reagan had adopted the kremlins way of thinking on disarmament and 
international relations 
some of the nations top advisers on foreign policy met with 
reporters to discuss the summit and its significance for relations 
between the superpowers they generally forecast improving 
relations 
the staterun press also said superpower ties were improving 
the labor newspaper trud pressed for a successful summit and said 
that the vast majority of americans want a better relationship with 
soviets the newspaper socialist industry declared that the two 
nations have entered a political thaw 
reagan was to arrive sunday for five days of meetings with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the fourth summit between the 
two leaders in less than three years 
previously our goals were more limited said us affairs 
expert georgy a arbatov observing that reagan and gorbachev in 
the past focused on easing tensions built up since world war ii 
now we have the possibility to move toward demilitarization 
of sovietamerican relations said arbatov head of the 
usacanada institute in moscow 
he compared the cold war to a dying patient kept alive by 
artificial means the task at hand for reagan and gorbachev is to 
bury this corpse of the cold war which with the help of 
artificial means political adrenalin and the political machinery 
of an artificial heart has been maintained in a semiliving 
state 
asked about reagans comment wednesday that he viewed his 
journey to the soviet capital as a mission of peace arbatov smiled 
and replied i think there is something symbolic in this that 
reagan is now coming with an olive branch to moscow 
he said he was happy to concede that his view of reagan had 
changed from that of a cold warrior to a statesman with whom the 
kremlin can work but arbatov said the president himself brought 
about the improvement by coming around to the soviets way of 
thinking on disarmament and international relations 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev military chief of staff and first 
deputy defense minister restated kremlin positions that there is 
no soviet superiority in conventional weapons in europe or 
excessive military spending but asked for details akhromeyev made 
the rare acknowledgement that the reported defense budget does not 
reflect spending on research development and production of weapons 
akhromeyev declined to say how much of the soviet unions gross 
national product is invested in defense saying he was privy only 
to the budget approved by the supreme soviet the nominal 
parliament which amounts to about 5 percent of government spending 
western estimates have put soviet defense spending as high as 19 
percent of the gross national product which represents the total 
value of all goods and services producted 
arbatov dismissed foreign assessments as speculation but 
conceded that soviet military spending is proportionately higher 
than in the united states because the soviet gross national product 
is lower while the demands of security are equal 
poking fun at the united states arbatov said the soviet 
military cannot do as the united states does and sell toilet 
seats for 700 or a hammer for 150 he was apparently referring 
to reports of excessive costs charged the us government under 
some private contracts with the defense department 
deputy foreign minister vladimir f petrovsky told reporters 
that the soviets view the upcoming summit as an important step in 
continuing improvement of relations rather than as a farewell to 
reagan whose term ends in january

kidnapping 
there was no dereliction of duty absence from post or failure 
to respond bouza said wednesday i dont discipline people who 
are trying to do their jobs and make a mistake in good faith 
he also dismissed the suggestion that prompter police action 
could have prevented the rape or at least shortened the victims

we could not have prevented the rape of that im sure he 
said by the time the police were able to do anything the rape 
had occurred she had been missing for hours by the time police 
were called

the officer the senior patrolman at the scene indicated in his 
report that the woman had probably cut her finger in the office 
the officer notified a homicide detective working the 
aftermidnight shift but neither he nor the detective investigated

the incident was treated as a missing person case meaning that 
it would not be assigned to a detective until the start of the next 
business day police said

vice president george bush today called 
for creation of an international drug strike force that would 
destroy drug crops wherever they are grown 
our military forces have already made a substantial 
contribution to our interdiction effort and today theyre being 
called upon to do more their primary target should be the 
production of drugs abroad he said 
bush in a campaign speech to a chamber of commerce audience 
also said he opposes any effort to weaken the justice departments 
zero tolerance policy for seizing vehicles on which drugs are 
found 
some call this policy controversial especially among those 
big yacht owners out there the vice president said i think it 
makes great sense if people can lose their cars for parking 
violations surely they should lose them for carrying drugs zero 
tolerance should be the policy of every state in the union 
the republican presidential nomineetobe planned to stress drug 
themes all day in campaign appearances including a visit in newark 
to a drug rehabilitation center 
bush said that if elected he would urge other nations to join 
in establishing an international strike force to hit back quick 
and hard and often at foreign drug operations 
he said it would be far simpler and less expensive to eradicate 
drugs at their source than to try to find and get rid of them 
later we need to wipe out crops wherever they are grown and take 
out labs wherever they exist bush said 
the vice president also said he would make adoption of drugfree 
programs a condition for companies to receive federal contracts 
and i will ask the states to do the same 
in jersey city on wednesday night bush said that even though he 
and president reagan may have some differences on dealing with gen 
manuel antonio noriega both want the panamanian leader out of 
power 
bush said that he isnt discouraged that the administrations 
efforts to negotiate an agreement with noriega collapsed on 
wednesday 
the vice president who aides have described as opposed to the 
talks said public opinion may be more on the side of the united 
states as a result of the impasse 
although bush said that he and reagan have had some 
differences on the subject the vice president said they share a 
common goal 
we have a policy objective of still getting noriega out of 
power he told reporters on wednesday 
the fact that we havent solved the problem at this instance 
doesnt depress me because i dont want a bad deal i want a good 
deal he said 
addressing a republican rally in jersey city on wednesday night 
the presumed gop presidential candidate said that if elected he 
would put his vice president in charge of antidrug programs in a 
drug czarlike posture 
bush has called for the death penalty for drug kingpins but 
has dodged questions on whether this should also apply to noriega 
who is under indictment in the united states on drugtrafficking 
charges 
earlier in the day bush told reporters in lakehurst nj that 
he was spending two days campaigning in new jersey even though he 
has the gop nomination clinched because he was concerned about 
polls showing him trailing the frontrunner in the democratic 
presidential race michael dukakis 
were behind im the underdog youve seen that in the 
polls bush said 
however he later voiced confidence that he would close the gap 
asking why should i worry about polls in may when the election 
is held in november 
he suggested that the race on the democratic side between 
dukakis and jesse jackson was giving dukakis a false image as a 
conservative because he comes across as less liberal than jackson 
its a blur out there bush said 
meanwhile bush campaign officials said that peter teeley a 
longtime bush adviser was stepping down from his job as campaign 
communications director 
campaign manager lee atwater said teeley would remain with the 
campaign but be a more creative type guy and work specifically on 
the surrogate teams 
no further reason was given for the switch but teeley was known 
to have been at odds recently with bush chief of staff craig fuller 
teeley will continue on as a senior political adviser said 
bush spokesman stephen hart 
as we head into the fall campaign roles and responsibilities 
are going to shift and change its the right time for such shifts 
to occur hart said 
i wouldnt characterize it as a shakeup hart said 
after a full day of campaigning in the newark area today bush 
planned to fly to his vacation retreat in kennebunkport maine 
where he will spend a week in strategy sessions and in meetings on 
issues with republican governors and other gop leaders 
in other developments on wednesday bush 
called for naming of an independent counsel to study recent 
allegations of financial irregularities surrounding house speaker 
jim wright dtexas were going to go after congress hard and 
talk about ethics if they want to talk about attorney general ed 
meese how about talking about the speaker 
the allegations concern royalties on a wright book and his 
intervention with federal regulators on behalf of troubled texas 
savings and loan associations 
told a west point commencement ceremony that a liberal 
elite was jeopardizing the nations security by failing to 
support weapons programs he said were needed although he didnt 
mention them by name bushs comments were apparently aimed at both 
dukakis and jackson

republican presidential nomineetobe george bush called today 
for an international strike force to hit quick and hard and 
often at foreign drug operations democrats jesse jackson and 
michael dukakis criticized the reagan administration for its 
dealings with panamas manuel noriega 
bush sought to recoup from the breakdown of talks aimed at 
dislodging noriega who faces drug trafficking charges in this 
country with tough talk on drugs during campaign stops in new 
jersey 
our military forces have already made a substantial 
contribution to our interdiction effort and today theyre being 
called upon to do more their primary target should be the 
production of drugs abroad bush said 
he called for an international strike force to hit back quick 
and hard and often at foreign drug operations to stop narcotics 
production at the source 
bushs comments came during campaign appearances in new jersey 
one of four states with primaries on june 7 dukakis and jackson 
concentrated on california the big prize on that final primary day 
as the two democrats debated in san francisco wednesday night 
jackson who released a fiveyear budget blueprint this week urged 
dukakis to spell out his spending plans 
the governor is laying out a budget of promises but not a 
budget of numbers jackson said 
dukakis replied that his experience as governor of massachusetts 
has taught him that it was a serious mistake to lay out a 
detailed budget plan so far in advance because the revenue picture 
can change drastically 
jackson also pressed his rival on policy toward south africa 
dukakis advocates putting pressure on the apartheid regime through 
economic sanctions jackson wants south africa declared a terrorist 
state 
but the two found little to differ about when it came to 
noriega and they made certain to bring bush into it 
dukakis attacked bushs call for the death penalty for drug 
kingpins in light of the noriega affair he said i dont know 
of anything phonier than that kind of policy 
its the height of hypocrisy for people in the administration 
to be advocating the death penalty for drug pushers while they are 
doing business with noriega and funneling aid to the contras 
through convicted drug dealers said dukakis who opposes the 
death penalty 
george bush must answer how much did he know about noriega 
and drugs and when jackson said as for drug traffickers he 
said do not deal with them and give them sanctuary and put them 
on the cia payroll 
bush has been treading a fine line on the noriega affair he has 
acknowledged that the controversy was probably partly to blame for 
his slide in the polls against dukakis his likely november 
opponent 
were behind im the underdog youve seen that in the 
polls bush said at a campaign stop in lakehurst nj on 
wednesday 
the vice president signalled last week that he disagreed with 
president reagans handling of the matter but he did it 
discreetly refusing to even mention noriegas name 
when secretary of state george p shultz announced wednesday 
that talks aimed at getting noriega out had collapsed and no new 
ones were planned bush responded the fact that we havent 
solved this doesnt depress me 
i dont want a bad deal he said coming as close as he has 
yet to publicly criticizing the administrations apparent readiness 
to drop drug charges as part of a deal to get noriega out 
i want a good deal well have to go back and figure it 
out he said expressing optimism that the military leader would 
eventually go 
aides said last week that bush had urged that the negotiations 
with noriega be suspended but on wednesday he stressed his unity 
with reagan rather than his differences saying he and the 
president share the policy objective of getting noriega out of 
power 
bush was taking the offensive on another controversy calling 
for an independent counsel to investigate possible ethics breaches 
by democratic house speaker jim wright the democrats have made 
attorney general edwin meese iii and his legal woes a campaign 
issue 
if theyre going to talk about ed meese how about talking 
about the speaker said bush wright has denied he violated 
ethics rules 
in another development bushs campaign communications director 
peter teeley announced he was quitting his post but would stay on 
with the campaign in some capacity teeley said he had not been 
given sufficient access to be an effective spokesman for the 
campaign 
meanwhile dukakis and his aides have been sounding more and 
more confident that the june 7 contests will give the massachusetts 
governor the number of delegates needed to nominate 
i think weve got a very good chance of wrapping up this 
nomination the first week or two of june he said at a refueling 
stop in des moines iowa as he flew to california on wednesday 
we want to wrap up this nomination if i can as soon as 
possible 
dukakis is far ahead of jackson in the delegate race according 
to the latest ap count he has 1687 to jacksons 983 of the 2081 
needed to nominate 
dukakis and jackson met privately after their debate and 
jackson said the two were keenly aware of our joint 
responsibility to our party but he also joked that the two 
talked about trying to balance my ticket with a conservative

a group of white south africans 
met today with four members of the outlawed african national 
congress to seek common ground in the struggle against apartheid 
in bonn meanwhile south african church leaders demanded in 
talks with chancellor helmut kohl that the common market adopt 
tough measures to pressure the pretoria government to dismantle its 
race laws 
delegation leader wynand malan said the eight white delegates 
were meeting confidentially with the anc guerrilla movement to seek 
common ground and strategies malan is a member of parliament 
and head of the national democratic movement 
the anc is waging a bombing and sabotage campaign against the 
white minority government of south africa it is based in lusaka 
zambia 
anc members at the frankfurt meeting were thabo mbeki head of 
information and publicity tony seedat the ancs chief 
representative in west germany and aziz pahad and jacob zuma all 
four belong to the ancs national executive committee 
malan told the associated press in an interview at a frankfurt 
hotel that the two groups would meet throughout the day 
this is a normal further discussion with the anc seeking a 
common ground and strategies out of the impasse in south africa 
malan said its the national democratic movements policy to 
meet with all political groupings 
west germany was chosen as a meeting site malan said because 
it was easy for both sides to get to quickly malan said he would 
return to south africa this evening 
the anc belongs to the essential political forces in south 
africa and is therefore an important dialogue partner malan told 
reporters 
among those meeting with kohl were the rev allan boesak 
president of the world alliance of reformed churches dr christian 
beyersnaude former head of the south african council of churches 
and denis hurley the roman catholic archbishop of durban 
the church leaders complained of a lack of engagement in 
europe toward real attempts to pressure the pretoria government 
for change according to a statement issued by the group 
they demanded that european economic community nations reduce 
the number of their diplomatic personnel in south africa place 
increased economic pressure on pretoria institute stricter visa 
requirements for south africans wishing to visit western europe 
and take other measures 
the group made its demands in bonn because west germany holds 
the rotating common market presidency the church group was 
visiting west germany separately from the apartheid opponents 
tha talks with the anc were expected to focus on a political 
program for antiapartheid groups that do not participate in south 
africas tricameral parliament it has separate chambers for 
whites asians and people of mixed race but there is no 
representation for the nations 26 million black majority 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the blacks have no vote in south african national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

natos chief military adviser said 
today the ussoviet treaty to remove groundlaunched 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles means natos conventional 
forces must be improved 
west german gen wolfgang altenburg chairman of natos panel of 
chiefs of staff said he has found no evidence the soviet union 
will cut back its military 
they the soviets are not able to define in which way their 
strategy has changed from an admittedly offensive to a presently 
defensive strategy he said 
altenburg spoke after giving nato defense ministers at their 
regular spring conference a routine briefing on soviet military 
capabilities 
he also predicted the nato allies will formally ask italy to 
accept the transfer of 72 us f16 jetfighters that are to be 
removed from spain within three years 
sources said the ministers discussed how the transfer estimated 
to cost 500 million should be funded altenburg said this would 
likely be done through natos joint infrastructure program 
i am quite sure that all members of the alliance agree that we 
do this economically 
the 72 jetfighters comprising the us air forces 401st 
tactical fighter wing are to be removed from the torrejon air base 
near madrid under a january agreement between spain and the united 
states 
altenburg said the soviet union still views nato as an offensive 
alliance and that it shows no signs of reducing its military 
outlays there is no evidence whatsoever in that respect that 
things have really changed 
he added that unabated growth in soviet military outlays were 
linked to the treaty under which hundreds of intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles will be removed from europe 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev signed the 
treaty dec 8 in washington 
we think that after the inf treaty the need to maintain our 
conventional posture is more important than ever he said 
us defense secretary frank c carlucci and his nato colleagues 
were meeting to review how the allies must share their common 
defense costs and ways they can make better use of available funds 
on wednesday the alliances european defense chiefs complained 
that some of the recent us criticism about their contributions to 
the alliance was unjustified 
in a report the ministers detailed their contributions to nato 
countering us congressional criticism that europe fails to pull 
its weight in the alliance 
europe is taking a fair share of the burdens in the 
alliance dutch defense minister wim van eekelen chairman of the 
meeting of the european ministers said later 
the debate over who pays what in nato stems from congressional 
efforts to curb us defense spending 
the europeans report said that of natos standing forces 
europe provides 90 percent of the troops and artillery 80 percent 
of the tanks and combat planes and 65 percent of nato warships 
it said 35 million european men and women are on active duty 
and 35 million are in reserve by comparison the united states 
has 23 million active duty troops and 15 million reservists the 
report said 
in their report natos european members agreed all allies must 
do more for nato in part by better managing their budgets 
the united states spent 67 percent of its gross national 
product on defense in 1987 against an average of 33 percent for 
the european allies 
the europeans argue the spending comparisons ignore 
unquantifiable burdens for them such as environmental damage from 
allied maneuvers and loss of income from real estate dedicated to 
military bases and other defense facilities

antonio light reported today 
the light said an unidentified source provided documents 
detailing the sale of hundreds of bones since 1983 by bexar county 
chief medical examiner dr vincent dimaios 
the bones obtained from bodies taken to the county morgue went 
to the nonprofit bone bank foundation of san antonio where they 
were cleaned chopped into pieces and freezedried for 
transplantation mostly for back dental or reconstructive surgery 
the newspaper reported 
survivors of the dead gave their consent thinking the bones 
were gifts of life to the foundation but dimaio charged up to 
200 for each bone removed the light reported 
a secretary in dimaios office today said he would be out of the 
office until next week 
the alleged sideline business is under investigation by the 
district attorneys office the newspaper said 
the investigation focuses on whether dimaio legally could charge 
the fees if he was extracting the bones on county time and using 
county facilities and employees a source outside the district 
attorneys office told the light 
the newspaper said invoices it obtained indicate the foundation 
paid dimaio up to 10000 per month for bones but none of those 
payments went to the county 
the county has a formal agreement with the bone bank foundation 
to be paid 25 for every donor to cover basic organharvesting 
costs

ashland oil inc today said the jan 2 fuel 
tank collapse that fouled two major rivers and contaminated 
drinking water in three states resulted from a dimesize flaw in 
the tanks nearly 50yearold steel 
a crack emanated from the flaw as workers were filling the 
4milliongallon tank at ashlands floreffe terminal south of here 
in freezing temperatures ashland said citing a report it 
commissioned from the battelle memorial institute of columbus ohio 
steel plate of that era lacked the toughness of modern steel and 
was made more brittle by the cold weather ashland said at a news 
conference 
the wall gave way under the pressure of 38 million gallons of 
diesel fuel and an estimated 713000 gallons entered the 
monongahela river 
the spill forced communities downstream along the monongahela 
and ohio rivers in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia to close 
their drinking water intakes 
about 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents were without tap 
water for most of the week because their water system lacked 
adequate reserves 
the steel was flawed before the plates were welded to make a 
tank at an ashland terminal near cleveland around 1940 ray mesloh 
head of the battelle investigators said in a report 
the original welding and welds made when the tank was cut apart 
and reassembled near pittsburgh in 1986 made the steel more brittle 
around the flaw in the bottom row of plates in the tanks circular 
wall he said 
these factors combined with cold temperatures and the stress 
placed on the tank as it was being filled near capacity created the 
conditions required for brittle fracture mesloh said in the 
report 
xrays of the welds made during the reconstruction showed some 
of the joints did not meet construction standards but tests 
performed by battelle indicated the welds were nonetheless stronger 
than the steel plate ashland said 
battelle also found that the steel had not deteriorated over 
time

georgia rep newt gingrich filed a formal 
complaint with the house ethics committee today asking for an 
investigation to determine if house speaker jim wright violated 
house ethics rules 
gingrichs complaint which was accompanied by a supporting 
letter signed by 71 house republicans asked for an investigation 
in four areas including published reports that wright received 
unusually high royalities of 55 percent from his book 
reflections of a public man 
common cause which calls itself a citizens lobby urged the 
ethics committee last week to launch an investigation of wright 
while the panel was not required legally to respond to that 
request gingrichs complaint will require a formal vote on whether 
to launch an investigation 
wrights book was published by a printing company that received 
nearly 300000 in business from his campaign committee in 198586 
the complaint said in asking for an investigation into whether 
wright converted campaign funds from the sale of his book to his 
personal gain 
the complaint also cited reports of wrights 1979 intervention 
with egyptian president anwar sadat in behalf of a businessman who 
earlier had allowed wright to invest in a proven oil well and 1980 
reports that wright intervened with the department of interior to 
influence a gas lease decision involving a company in which wright 
owned 15000 worth of stock 
the volume of published evidence clearly calls for 
investigation said gingrich a leader of republican 
conservatives in the house who before today had waged a solitary 
yearlong ethics campaign against wright 
wright was asked what he thought of gingrich and said his views 
of the conservative georgia congressman are similar to those of a 
fire hydrant toward dogs 
wright sent a letter to rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of 
the ethics committee on wednesday promising his full cooperation 
if the panel made up of six democrats and six republicans decided 
to investigate him 
i feel certain i have not violated any house rules wright 
said today i most certainly have never intended to do so 
wright said he hopes the ethics panel will resolve the matter 
promptly and if they find that i have violated some rule just 
say so and have it done so it doesnt become an encumbrance 
an embarassment to the democrats 
wright accused gingrich of timing his complaint so that the 
ethics investigation would coincide with the democratic national 
convention which wright is scheduled to chair 
gingrich who has been calling for an investigation of wright 
since last december denied that the complaint was timed to detract 
attention from democratic efforts to use the ethics issue against 
vice president george bush in the presidential campaign 
gingrich said however that bush aides have been meeting with 
his staff over the past seven to eight weeks to discuss gingrichs 
ethics campaign against wright he also said he has been getting 
supportive comments privately from the white house for the past 
three months 
on wednesday bush called for the naming of an independent 
counsel to study allegations of financial irregularities 
surrounding wright

the judge in the irancontra case said today 
that the congressional immunity granted oliver l north and two 
codefendands could make trying the three on conspiracy charges a 
practical impossibility 
us district judge gerhard a gesell raised the problem at a 
hearing on the difficulty resulting from immunized testimony given 
to congress by north a former national security council staff 
member former presidential national security adviser john m 
poindexter and businessman albert hakim 
gesell made no ruling on the question of proceeding with trial 
and is not expected to for some time 
but the judge told attorneys in the case that under normal trial 
procedures a defendant could take the stand and be questioned by a 
codefendant about testimony given earlier to congress 
inthis case gesell said none of the statements given congress 
under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution can be used at 
trial 
as i see it it is a practical impossibility to try the 
conspiracy counts gesell said if you try them the 
defendants together you violate the immunities 
gesell said separate trials also would raise a problem because 
the defendants might not be able to call each other as witnesses to 
defend their own positions for instance poindexter could refuse 
to testify that he authorized norths activities in the irancontra 
affair if subpoenaed by norths lawyers 
north poindexter hakim and businessman richard v secord are 
charged with conspiring to turn a lawful presidential directive to 
sell arms to iran into an illegal enterprise which included 
profiting from the weapons sales and assistance to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels during a ban on such aid secord did not testify 
under an immunity grant 
barry simon attorney for north argued at the hearing that the 
case should not go forward because the prosecution staff of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh and grand jury witnesses were 
exposed to the immunized testimony 
their testimony is being used against them simon said 
theres no way of unscrambling that problem it is a problem that 
absolutely prevades the case 
you cant unscramble what witnesses now know after what they 
had seen and heard from immunized testimony and what they knew 
before 
while the conspiracy counts are the main charges other charges 
against the three include theft of government property acceptance 
of an illegal gratuity obstruction of a congressional 
investigation false statements to congress and obstruction of a 
presidential inquiry 
at an earlier hearing gesell said it also could be difficult to 
proceed to trial unless the government made available to the 
defense thousands of classified documents in the case 
federal officials have been sending those documents on a regular 
basis to a secure facility rented by the federal government for the 
use of the defendants 
gesell did not say at todays hearing whether he remains as 
concerned about the classified document problem as he had been

prisoner who was given permission by the castro government to set

catholic educators still facing a retreat 
in parochial school enrollment are looking toward a future in 
which religious education programs outside school loom even larger 
indeed at a weeklong symposium on the future of catholic 
education that ends today most of the discussion centered on 
programs that reach out to children and adults outside the 
traditional school structure 
there was virtually no debate at the catholic education futures 
project sessions about how to stem the erosion of parochial 
schools which lost 110 more schools and 103000 students last year 
alone there are now 26 million students in 8992 catholic 
schools down from a peak of 56 million in more than 13000 
schools in 1964 
even before adjourning the nearly 300 educators at the 
conference had decided against trying to finish writing a vision 
statement on their churchs educational mission for the next 
century 
but asked to identify the most important elements of catholic 
education they gave strongest support to the declaration 
catholic education exists to proclaim the gospel to promote 
lifelong personal growth and faith formation of all peoples and to 
support the mission of the church 
other priority items included promoting respect for all 
cultures which make up our pluralistic society eliminating 
sexism and racism paying particular concern to education of the 
poor and making better use of our changing resources 
the actual writing of the final document was to done later by 
representatives of the 22 church groups at the meeting held at the 
university of dayton 
only a quarter of the educators at the symposium are involved in 
parochial schools others work with young adults converts college 
students and catholic children from public school 
historically the public school child who attended weekly 
religion classes was considered a second class citizen said 
bishop james malone of youngstown 
but now archdioceses around the country are installing paid 
fulltime directors of religious education like janet kayser a 
laywoman who runs the programs for st thomas parish in crystal 
lake ill 
when the topic of catholic education comes up theres too 
much emphasis in thinking it means only schools said kayser who 
has 650 students in her programs 
in some places she said there has been a real injustice in 
balancing between the needs of the school and the religious 
education program 
the rev thomas lynch pastor of st james church in bridgeport 
conn said only 280 of the 2900 families in his parish send 
children to the parochial school but the school with a 530000 
budget consumes half the parish revenues 
lynch is trying to rename the school the st james center for 
religious formation to stress some of his parishs prayer classes 
scripture study and other educational activities but he admits his 
parishioners get nervous about such a change 
lynch said catholic schools must emphasize the teaching of faith 
just as much as geography math or anything else there is no 
reason to operate a parochial school that smells like and looks 
like the public school except for maybe a course in religion and an 
amorphous catholic environment he said 
bishop francis schulte of west virginia who heads the bishops 
committee on education said in an interview i believe theres 
no adequate substitute for the full curriculum catholic school 
but he acknowledged that there are very substantial areas where 
catholic parents simply dont have a parochial school available 
to those who would like to see the church shift more resources 
into other religion education efforts schulte said theres a 
fallacy that if the catholic school was not present in a 
parish then all or most of that money would then go into other 
educational programs most of the money is in the form of tuition 
that would disappear with the school he said 
parochial schools flourished in big cities with immigrants from 
catholic lands like ireland italy and poland when catholics 
became more affluent and moved to the suburbs churches followed 
but schools did not 
we have buildings in places where we dont have catholic 
children and we have catholic children in places where we dont 
have schools said sister lourdes sheehan of the national 
catholic educational association a sponsor of the symposium 
malone said the genius of the meeting has to be to affirm the 
continued importance and place of the catholic school but then 
acknowledge generously and fully that these other activities and 
ministries are a part of catholic education 
ideally the catholic school is the best vehicle weve had for 
helping parents teach values in the catholic tradition said 
malone 
but weve never had more than 50 percent of our kids in 
catholic schools he added what happens if you cant have a 
cadillac you certainly find out you can fix up the volkswagen 
pretty well and get along with that

services office down the hall from sen edward m kennedys and

wall street reacted skeptically today to 
financier carl c icahns offer to buy texaco inc pushing the oil 
companys stock higher but still well below the 60 a share hes 
touting 
the stock rose 4 to 5087 on the new york stock exchange one 
day after texacos largest investor disclosed the cash offer that 
values the company at 146 billion texaco called the proposal a 
phony bear hug pressure ploy 
icahn who bought trans world airlines and has chased other big 
companies such as usx corp publicized the offer shortly after 
texaco management scrapped talks with him over how to restructure 
following its emergence from bankruptcy court reorganization in 
april 
he disclosed the offer late wednesday in a letter to texaco 
management 
icahn has amassed a 148 percent stake in the nations 
thirdlargest oil company and has been seeking the most profitable 
way to exploit it 
earlier this month icahn who has said texaco would be worth 
more broken up and sold threatened a shareholder proxy fight to 
install five allies on its board the company responded by suing 
him for alleged securities fraud 
they began peace talks about three weeks ago texaco president 
james kinnear said the company terminated the discussions wednesday 
because of what he called icahns unreasonable demands for special 
treatment in a restructuring 
texaco will not be bullied or cajoled into recommending to its 
shareholders a transaction that is not in their best interest or 
the best interest of the company kinnear said 
icahn spokesman daniel h burch said texaco made a totally 
inaccurate characterization of the negotiations 
he at all times sought a restructuring that would treat all 
stockholders equally burch said weve now proposed a 60 cash 
merger that does treat all shareholders equally 
of 243 texaco shares outstanding icahn owns about 36 million 
for which he paid an average 34 each or about 122 billion 
combined with the 1242 billion he offered to pay for the rest 
the total offer is worth about 1364 billion 
if completed such an offer would be the biggest in corporate 
history the previous record was the 1984 134 billion acquisition 
of gulf corp by standard oil co of california now chevron corp 
icahn said in his letter that he would drop the proxy contest if 
management would allow other stockholders to consider the offer he 
gave management until 5 pm friday to think it over 
he provided few other details but said part of his financing 
plan would include the sale of texaco canada inc and caltex two 
of texacos most prized assets 
however we intend to maintain texacos core business and 
return it to its rightful place as a leader in its industry just 
as we have done with twa icahn said 
texaco spokeswoman anita larsen called icahns proposal an 
illusory offer which so far as texaco has seen provides absolutely 
no details regarding financing disappears in less than 48 hours 
and is put forward as an alternative to allow him to avoid the 
proxy contest with which he has been threatening the company 
just a few hours ago he was demanding that texaco help him 
unload the shares he already owns she said 
company sources speaking on condition of anonymity said icahn 
had been hinting at such a move since talks began and that kinnear 
regarded it as a desperate ploy 
hes been threatening that kind of bear hug said one source 
nevertheless icahn said in his letter that he was so sure he 
could obtain financing that he would place 100 million in escrow 
and forfeit it to texaco if he failed to get commitments by the 
annual shareholders meeting 
texaco said that in accordance with an agreement with icahn it 
would delay that meeting from june 7 to june 17 unless the 
financier withdrew his board slate 
icahns offer came after the close of trading on the new york 
stock exchange where texaco shares rose 1 to 4687 the stock 
had been falling steadily since the negotiations began 
analysts have estimated the company would be worth between 60 
and 80 a share if it was broken up and sold 
icahns offer was the latest chapter in a troubled texaco saga 
that began when smaller rival pennzoil co won a 105 billion 
judgment against it in 1985 eventually driving texaco into 
bankruptcy court 13 months ago as part of a strategy to save itself 
texaco emerged from bankruptcy in april after settling with 
pennzoil by paying it 3 billion and announcing a drastic 
restructuring plan that includes the sale of about 5 billion in 
assets

us diplomats began a round of consultations 
with latin american governments today in a search for new options 
on bringing about the departure of gen manuel antonio noriega from 
panama a state department official said 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said us 
ambassadors were instructed to seek advice from the presidents and 
the foreign ministers of their respective countries 
abrams spoke to reporters after a closeddoor meeting of the 
senate foreign relations committee to discuss the failed 
administration attempt to negotiate noriegas resignation as 
defense chief and his departure from panama 
we begin today a round of consultations with democracies 
throughout latin america abrams said cables went out last 
night instructing our ambassadors to see the presidents of their 
host countries today and the foreign ministers and to tell them 
what happened in detail and to ask for their advice in helping us 
move forward 
republican and democratic senators hailed the collapse of us 
efforts to negotiate noriegas departure and the countrys 
antinoriega ambassador said today the united states should let 
latin americans solve the problem 
a lot of people are not upset that it fell apart said sen 
john kerry dmass the morning after secretary of state george 
shultz told a hastily arranged news conference that noreiga had 
rejected us proposals for his resignation as defense chief and 
his temporary departure from panama 
but kerry said in an interview on abctvs good morning 
america that the negotiations to oust noriega hurt us foreign 
policy and also sent a terrible message with respect to our 
ability to do something about the narcotics traffic 
sen christopher dodd dconn on cbs this morning urged 
the administration to start working with latin american leaders on 
the matter and said no options for dealing with noriega should be 
ruled out 
dodd urged panamanians to keep pressure on general noriega to 
realize that hes not safe when he leaves his country and not 
secure at home either 
ambassador juan sosa said on cbs the united states should 
hold back and let other initiatives go forward 
sosa said the reagan administration negotiated in good faith but 
should not have dealt with a terrorist the problem is noriega is 
not an honorable person he said 
in another appearance on nbctvs today sosa said i 
suggest that other initiatives diplomatic initiatives political 
initiatives that are on the drawing boards and are initiatives that 
panamanians are putting together with other latin american 
countries be given a chance although i still doubt that noriega 
has any intention whatsoever of relinquishing power 
reaction to the collapse of the negotiations came as no suprise 
since criticism of the administrations stand had been widespread 
well before shultzs announcement the critics included vice 
president george bush justice department officials panamanian 
opposition leaders and 86 senators 
perhaps the most biting comment was made by sen alan cranston 
dcalif who expressed no regret at all for the administrations 
negotiations failure 
this administration negotiates with the darndest people 
iranian terrorists and panamanian drug dealers cranston said 
i think we should have an administration which doesnt negotiate 
with people like that 
this administration has handled the noriega situation so badly 
that it is an embarrassment to the united states 
after the negotiations broke down president reagan ordered the 
return of state department envoy michael kozak to washington 
shultz said that the negotiating package worked out laboriously 
between kozak and panamanian officials in the last few weeks has 
been scrapped 
no further negotiations are contemplated shultz said all 
proposals addressed during these negotiations have been withdrawn 
no offers remain on the table 
shultz refused comment when asked if military solutions are 
being contemplated but at the pentagon officials insisted there 
were no plans afoot for direct military intervention in panama 
for much of the day wednesday a deal seemed to be within reach 
but kozak telephoned the state department at 4 pm edt to pass 
along the news of noriegas decision 
at the final moment in negotiations noriega would not carry 
through with the arrangements his representatives had negotiated 
shultz told reporters 
under secretary of state michael armacost said noriega had 
indicated that majors and captains within panamas defense 
forces might take strong action against him if he agreed to the 
deal 
bush who has expressed some misgivings at the reagan 
administrations negotiations with noriega on wednesday said that 
he still was optimistic that noriega could be persuaded to step 
down 
im convinced noriega will be out of power bush told 
reporters in lakehurst nj the fact that we havent solved this 
doesnt depress me 
i dont want a bad deal i want a good deal well have to go 
back and figure it out 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said that he 
welcomed shultzs announcement noriega must go if we are to 
achieve our goals in panama but sending noriega off into 
retirement with a legal golden parachute would have been the 
wrong step at the wrong time 
this was a reference to the most controversial aspect of the 
administrations proposal dismissing federal drug smuggling 
indictments against noriega 
in february two federal grand juries in florida indicted 
noriega on charges of taking at least 46 million in payoffs from 
a drug ring based in medellin colombia to protect cocaine 
shipments launder money and hide drug smugglers from law 
enforcement officials 
in return for the withdrawal of the indictments noriega was to 
step down as commander of the defense forces in august and go into 
exile until after elections for a civilianled government were held 
in may 1989 
the state departments view throughout the negotiations was that 
dismissal of the indictments against noriega was a small price to 
pay for his departure from panama and the restoration of democratic 
rule

two bombs exploded in downtown 
pretoria today and injured four whites as the national party marked 
40 years in power a cabinet minster blamed the outlawed african 
national congress guerrilla movement 
the attacks in the south african capital coincided with 
anniversary celebrations by president pw bothas party 
responsible for the countrys apartheid legislation the national 
party has led the government since the whitesonly election of may 
26 1948 
four white women all librarians in their 30s were returning 
from lunch when a bomb exploded in a flowerpot at a busy street 
corner 
one woman lost an arm a second suffered back injuries and the 
other two had extensive facial burns according to a statement from 
hf verwoerd hospital 
about five minutes earlier a bomb placed under a parked car 
exploded several blocks away the car was completely destroyed but 
there were no injuries 
witnesses said earlier that at least five people were injured in 
one blast and that one or two may have been killed but there was 
no confirmation of fatalities 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility law and order 
minister adriaan vlok blamed the african national congress which 
wages a bombing and sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the 
whiteled government 
the anc based in lusaka zambia generally does not confirm or 
deny any role in the attacks 
vlok also condemned a trip by white south african antiapartheid 
politicians who are meeting today and friday with anc leaders in 
frankfurt west germany the group is led by wynand malan a member 
of parliament and leader of the national democratic movement 
vlok said it was ironic that bombings were taking place at 
the same time people such as wynand malan are busy holding 
talks with this unscrupulous terror organization 
the government opposes all contact with the anc and says it will 
not negotiate with the organization until it disavows violence 
there have been more than 70 bomb blasts in south africa since a 
nationwide state of emergency was declared in june 1986 although 
the number of explosions has fallen sharply in the past year 
the police have blamed virtually all the blasts on the anc 
the anc did claim responsibility for deadliest bombing in south 
african history the may 20 1983 blast in pretoria killed 19 and 
injured about 200 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

authorities dont suspect foul play in the death 
of a 79yearold woman but will exhume her remains more than a 
month after the funeral on a technicality she was buried without 
a signed death certificate 
cook county circuit judge kenneth gillis ordered the exhumation 
and an autopsy because the burial of marie r drake was illegal and 
her estate cant be closed without a death certificate officials 
said wednesday 
imagine putting yourself in the childrens position having 
buried their mother a month ago and then suddenly finding out the 
death certificate was never signed said elliott robbins an 
attorney for mrs drakes children ronald drake and marion sottile 
they thought they had laid their mother to rest and now she 
has to be dragged up again he said wednesday its a very 
very gutwrenching experience i dont know how this could have 
happened 
mrs drake was found dead apparently of natural causes in her 
home in suburban elmwood park on april 14 a thursday said sean 
fitzgerald an assistant cook county states attorney 
the county medical examiners office was not called because 
police didnt suspect foul play and the family doctor was expected 
to sign the death certificate said roy dames administrator in the 
examiners office 
but the funeral home couldnt get in touch with the doctor over 
the weekend and a funeral was planned for monday morning said 
funeral director steven lewis 
lewis said that he knew that burying a body without a death 
certificate is a violation of the law but that the funeral home 
decided to proceed with the funeral anyway believing the doctor 
would sign the document after the fact 
however dr charles shallat refused to sign apparently because 
he hadnt seen mrs drake as a patient in four years said 
fitzgerald shallat did not return a message left with his 
answering service wednesday 
the family didnt discover the problem until they began trying 
to settle her estate in county probate court said robbins 
like the doctor the medical examiners office refused to sign 
the certificate without inspecting the body 
we cant tell what the cause of death is without looking at 
the body she might have a gunshot wound to the head for all i 
know said dames 
fitzgerald said he didnt know whether charges would be filed 
against the funeral home

bitter division to this old english channel port under the famed 
white cliffs 
a vast majority of the dover seamen of p and o european ferries 
the largest english channel ferry operator voted feb 2 to strike 
over new work practices the company wanted to impose 
nearly four months later the walkout remains unresolved and the 
2220 workers are bitterly divided 
one side decided in late april to defy the national union of 
seamen and accept a revised p and o proposal to return to work 
the men and women who chose to stay out lost their jobs 
some of those who returned to work have found the word scab 
scrawled in red paint on their homes others have reported 
receiving threatening anonymous telephone calls 
brian young mayor of the city of about 40000 people fears 
dover will feel the pain longer after the strike is settled 
youre going to get splits in the community he said 
people are having to make hard decisions 
people rely on each other in an emergency out there when there 
is a 10force gale he added people will remember who didnt 
back them up in a strike 
p and o which is refusing further negotiations with the union 
says 1100 former strikers are back on the job the union says its 
only 250 
violence broke out on the picket lines april 29 when p and o 
operated two of its 11 ferries with strikebreaking crews 
the company says it now is operating five vessels two carrying 
passengers and three carrying freight and has brought its work 
force back to 65 percent of its previous level by hiring from a 
pool of 8000 outsiders 
what has happened here is a tragedy said striker steve 
bartlett i wont speak to them the strikebreakers ever again 
they betrayed us they are traitors 
the strikers say they wont accept the new work rules namely 
more shifts on grounds that they jeopardize ferry safety 
the loss of 193 lives including ferry crewmen in last years 
sinking of the p and os herald of free enterprise off zeebrugge 
belgium had a profound effect on dover whose principal industry 
is its port which goes back to roman times 
but p and o insists nothing in its work proposals is unsafe and 
that safety is a paramount issue with the company 
p and o maintains it needs the new work practices to make it 
more competitive with the new english channel rail tunnel which 
will offer speedier travel between england and france when it opens 
in 1993 
the strikers however believe p and o is trying to destroy 
their union with the backing of prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government 
dover residents who support the opposition labor party feel 
intensely that the chairman of the parent p and o steam navigation 
co sir jeffrey sterling has benefitted from mrs thatchers 
capitalist policies 
although dovers economy has been hurt by the walkout large 
segments of the community appear to back the strikers 
its always been a seafaring town so these seamen have a lot 
of support said james moore a taxi driver 
mayor young said shopkeepers donate food to the strikers who 
have set up soup kitchens to guarantee that the seamen and their 
families get at least one hot meal a day 
the seamen who made the equivalent of 20500 to 31600 a 
year are having to make do now with a total of about 372 in 
strike payments from their union 
crewmen who have gone back to work avoid talking about it to 
reporters 
there are too many reprisals said the wife of one 
shrinking away from her front door 
the first crews to go back to work issued a statement saying 
their decision was based on a desire to save the company from being 
sold to foreigners that they didnt want outsiders to get their 
jobs and that the strike was undemocratic 
hundreds of picketers still wait at the entrance of the docks 
every morning for company buses ferrying strikebreakers 
shouting with fists raised they have persuaded a handful of 
workers a few of them in tears to get off and join them on the 
picket line

indian troops backed by helicopter 
gunships attacked tamil rebel camps in northern sri lanka on 
thursday in an offensive that has killed 30 rebels and 10 soldiers 
an indian official said 
the united news of india news agency said 6000 indian troops 
were involved in the offensive which began tuesday near the 
fishing village of mullaitivu 170 miles northeast of colombo 
an official at the indian high commission said at least 30 tamil 
fighters were killed and 39 injured since tuesday the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said 10 indian troops were 
killed and 21 wounded in the operation 
in a radio broadcast tamils put the rebel death toll at eight 
one rebel spokesman whose uses the nom de guerre dinesh said that 
25 indian soldiers had been killed 
the figures could not be independently verified because 
communications with the town have been cut 
the operation is still on the indian official said 
the rebels who are fighting for an independent tamil homeland 
have used the village as a smuggling base indian officials said 
the offensive was the largest india has launched since oct 10 
when indian troops fought two weeks to capture the northern jaffna 
peninsula from the rebels 
india has sent more than 50000 troops to the island to enforce 
an indiansponsored peace accord signed july 29 the pact signed by 
india and sri lanka was aimed at ending a nearly fiveyear 
insurgency by tamil rebels 
tamils who are mostly hindus and make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million population claim they are discriminated against 
by the majority sinhalese buddhists who control the government and 
the military 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest rebel group 
has rejected the peace accord and vowed to continue its guerrilla 
struggle for an independent homeland in the north and east of the 
island where most tamils live 
the tigers have been operating from jungle bases since the 
jaffna offensive and still conduct hitandrun raids on the indian 
forces 
india is involved because its own 60 million ethnic tamils are 
sympathetic to their sri lankan brethren 
before the latest offensive more than 435 indian soldiers had 
died since the troops were sent to the island july 30

vice president george bush is likely to 
benefit only indirectly from president reagans summit next week 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev scholars and political 
observers say 
whereas bush had a role in the washington summit last december 
the vice president will be far from the moscow drama meeting 
privately with republican party leaders at his home in 
kennebunkport maine 
bush as many may remember stood at gorbachevs side during an 
improptu stop the soviet leader made at a washington street corner 
the moscow summit may present for bush another in the series of 
catch22type problems that have followed his quest for the white 
house the thinking is that if something goes wrong in moscow bush 
will be held as accountable as reagan but if there is some 
surprising positive development the american people will give 
reagan credit 
the truth is he probably should gain something from the 
summit and he probably wont said larry sabato a presidential 
scholar at the university of virginia 
i just dont think its going to make any difference for him 
because hes not going there sabato said besides he seems to 
be having all the good things in the reagan record roll off and 
all the bad things stick these days 
but bushs campaign aides hope the vice presient gets some 
advantage from the reagangorbachev summit 
communications director peter teeley said that whatever you 
get out of the thing is going to depend on the accomplishments the 
mood and the tone 
sabato teeley and others said bush will almost surely benefit 
to a certain degree if the summit proceeds without incident or 
problems they said that he would be credited with being a part of 
an administration that is advancing the prospects of peace and 
easing tensions with the soviets 
much of the american public believes that relations between 
these two countries are getting better so the bush experience 
factor is important teeley said 
bush in fact met with gorbachev before gorbachev ascended to 
the top kremlin position and the vice president attended the 
funerals of fallen kremlin leaders leonid brezhnev yuri andropov 
and konstantin chernenko 
on the campaign trail hes fond of telling how he observed 
brezhnevs wife doing the sign of the cross as she hovered over his 
dead body 
during the december summit bush made a big play over his 
oneonone meeting with gorbachev at the soviet embassy pictures 
were taken as the pair sat smiling on a sofa and the bush campaign 
depicted the vice president as a person who would provide 
continuity in us dealings with the soviets 
stephen wayne a presidential scholar at george washington 
university said the chief advantage the summit presents to bush is 
that it basically takes a critical issue from the democrats the 
fear of war with the soviet union it takes a scary world and makes 
it less scary 
but wayne said bush would gain a much greater advantage if he 
were to attend the summit and said modern communications and other 
precautions could remove the obstacles to both the president and 
vice president being together on foreign soil 
but he said i dont see the people around the president being 
willing to share the glory with bush if there is some stunning 
accomplishment there 
we know that the vice president is in the worst of all 
possible situations wayne said he cannot take credit for the 
administrations successes and he has to share the blame for its 
failures 
rep jim leach riowa a former aide when bush was us 
ambassador to the united nations claimed it was bush who talked 
the west german government into accepting pershing ii missiles 
even though there was a burgeoning antinuclear movement in that 
country and chancellor helmut kohl was under tremendous political 
pressure 
us officials have said they believe the soviets would never 
have come to the table to negotiate an intermediaterange missile 
treaty had it not been for the willingness of west germany and 
other north atlantic allies to have us missiles placed on their 
soil 
leach said that because the personal dimensions of summits are 
almost always presidential it would be difficult for bush to get 
close enough to center stage to get a big political bounce at home 
sabato said if politics were fair i think he ought to get 
some credit just because the summit is happening but he wont

was overturned 
us district judge dudley h bowen acted on the basis of an 
argument frequently posed by ross attorneys over the years that 
blacks were improperly excluded from the grand jury and his trial 
jury 
ross was convicted by a colquitt county jury of 12 white men for 
the slaying of a white officer moultrie lt tommie meredith 
the evidence bowen ruled tuesday does not support the 
contention that the lack of blacks and women was due to neutral 
selection criteria and procedures 
bowen directed officials to release ross now 48 from custody 
if he is not reindicted and reconvicted with constitutionally 
selected juries within one year 
southern judicial circuit district attorney lamar cole was out 
of town his staff said and could not be reached for comment 
georgia attorney general michael bowers said he had not received 
the ruling and could not comment 
ross a native of jacksonville fla was one of the first three 
men scheduled for execution after georgias new capital punishment

the superpower summit in moscow next week is 
expected to include a us appeal to soviet leaders to promote a 
peaceful settlement in southern africa by encouraging the 
withdrawal of cuban forces in angola 
following an unsually intense period of diplomatic exchanges 
us officials say they see the southern africa issue as the third 
world conflict that offers the best hope for a settlement 
it is not clear how much personal attention president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will pay to the issue but other 
officials said that at a mimimum it will be discussed at lower 
levels 
under secretary of state michael armacost said last week that 
the united states has been seeking from the soviets use of their 
influence with angola and cuba to encourage a realistic and 
prompt timetable for the withdrawal of cuban forces 
according to us estimates cuba has increased by at least 
6000 its troop strength in angola to between 43000 and 45000 
over the past several months it also has deployed its forces to 
within a few miles of the border with south africancontrolled 
southwest africa also known as namibia for the first time 
aside from the cuban troop issue the administration also has 
been asking the soviets to promote a process of national 
reconciliation between the marxist government in angola and the 
usbacked rebel group unita the two sides have been at war for 
almost 13 years 
south africa sent up to 3000 troops into angola last year in 
support of unita although angolan estimates of pretorias 
involvement have been much higher 
with assistant secretary of state chester crocker playing the 
key role the administration has for years been attempting to 
promote the withdrawal of all foreign forces from southern africa 
cubans from angola and south africans from namibia and angola 
as the us sees it this would free the area of both superpower 
competition and colonialism enabling the region to concentrate on 
development after years of warfare namibia is africas last colony 
the administration has been calling for parallel movement on 
both the angolan and namibian issues the stumbling block thus far 
is that while the south africans have agreed to turn namibia over 
to an independent government under a oneyear timetable outlined in 
a un security council resolution angola has proposed a cuban 
departure from angola over a fouryear time frame 
the united states believes the angolan timetable is excessive 
with us support south africa has said it will not relinquish 
control over namibia unless there is an early timetable for a full 
cuban withdrawal from angola 
as described by us officials the principal soviet advantage 
in encouraging a peaceful settlement is that the kremlin would be 
spared continued largescale losses of military equipment 
the south african military has said that during a 1987 angolan 
offensive against unita and south african forces sovietmade 
equipment losses included eight mig 23s four mig 21s eight 
helicopters and 94 tanks among other items 
but the cuban military has said that in recent fighting a south 
african escalation was given a firm decisive and crushing 
response cuba has defended its presence in angola as an effort 
to protect that country against racist aggression by south 
africa 
lately the pace of diplomacy has increased earlier this month 
officials from the united states south africa angola and cuba met 
in london to explore the possibilities for a settlement the 
parties expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the 
unprecedented encounter and agreed to meet again

senior kremlin advisers urged superpower leaders 
thursday to bury remaining cold war differences and praised 
president reagans comment that he heads to moscow on a mission of 
peace 
the task at next weeks summit is to bury this corpse of the 
cold war which with the help of artificial means has been 
maintained in a semiliving state said us affairs expert 
georgy a arbatov one of several foreign affairs advisers who 
predicted improved ussoviet relations in a meeting with 
reporters 
the staterun press also painted a rosy picture of superpower 
ties the labor newspaper trud invoked us public opinion in 
pressing for a successful summit claiming most americans want 
better relations with the soviets and socialist industry declared 
that the two nations have entered a political thaw 
reagan arrives sunday for five days of meetings with mikhail s 
gorbachev it will be the fourth summit between the two leaders 
previously our goals were more limited said arbatov 
observing that reagan and gorbachev in the past focused on easing 
tensions built up since world war ii 
now we have the possibility to move toward demilitarization of 
sovietamerican relations he said 
asked about reagans comment wednesday that he viewed his 
journey to the soviet capital as a mission of peace arbatov smiled 
and replied i think there is something symbolic in this that 
reagan is now coming with an olive branch to moscow 
he said his view of reagan had changed from that of a cold 
warrior to a statesman but arbatov said reagan had brought about 
the improvement by coming around to the soviet way of thinking on 
disarmament and international relations 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev military chief of staff and first 
deputy defense minister joined in the spirit of new thinking 
as the kremlin refers to the force behind its foreign policy shifts 
over the three years since gorbachev came to power 
akhromeyev declared himself a completely different person as 
a result of gorbachevs reforms and said many other officials are 
experiencing the same feeling 
but he clung to standard kremlin positions alleging that there 
is no soviet superiority in conventional weapons in europe or 
excessive spending on arms but asked for details on soviet defense 
spending akhromeyev made the rare acknowledgement that the 
reported defense budget does not reflect spending on research 
development and production of weapons 
akhromeyev declined to say how much of the soviet unions gross 
national product is invested in defense claiming he was privy only 
to the budget approved by the supreme soviet which amounts to 
about 5 percent of government spending that would put it at about 
339 billion 
western estimates have put soviet defense spending as high as 19 
percent of the gross national product which measures the value of 
all goods and services produced in a nation 
arbatov dismissed foreign assessments as speculation but 
said soviet spending on the military is proportionally higher than 
in the united states because the soviet gross national product is 
lower while the demands of security are equal 
deputy foreign minister vladimir f petrovsky told reporters 
that the talks would help in overcoming the heritage of the cold 
war 
all of the advisers contended that the reagangorbachev meetings 
could produce important advances in negotiations toward a treaty 
that would halve us and soviet strategic nuclear arsenals

of 12 white men in the shooting death of moultrie police lt tommie

a man shot a woman he apparently 
mistook for his wife offered to take her to a hospital then 
killed himself with a shot to the head authorities said 
were going on the assumption that it was a case of mistaken 
identity marshall county sheriffs capt randy amos said after 
the shootings wednesday 
officials said ernest michael bowman 32 shot marsha lynn 
atchley 26 at lake guntersville she was in fair condition 
thursday at carraway methodist medical center 
i think he realized just what a mistake he had made and he 
couldnt handle that police lt carl fulmer said 
ms atchley of arab told witnesses she had never before seen 
the man who shot her once in the chest with a 32caliber pistol 
witnesses said the woman was in a bathing suit and lying on a 
chaise lounge at a lake when bowman drove up walked over to her 
and knelt beside her 
one witness said he heard the woman scream and then heard a 
gunshot amos said she begged bowman not to shoot her again 
and he told her it was all a mistake and then asked her if he could 
take her to the hospital 
ms atchley refused and walked to her car and got in amos said 
while bowman walked back to his truck 
fulmer said bowman traveled about onethird of a mile then 
pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head while the truck was 
moving he said the truck traveled about 300 more yards before 
stopping in a ditch 
bowman apparently was upset that a warrant charging him with 
parole violation was issued wednesday if convicted he would have 
faced serving the remaining three years of a 10year sentence for 
the aug 23 1980 robbery of a package store 
he was paroled about a year ago and had fulfilled all the 
requirements of his parole until this month parole officer bobby 
roberts said on may 3 roberts said he was arrested and charged 
with public intoxication assault and harassment of his wife 
he was found guilty on may 9 roberts said that was sufficient 
cause to revoke his parole and issue a warrant for his arrest

senate negotiators worked today to clear away 
the remaining obstacles to a ussoviet treaty banning 
mediumrange nuclear missiles and headed toward almost certain 
approval of the first armscontrol treaty to be ratified in 16 
years 
meetings on the remaining issues resumed today between the 
senates leaders and senior members of the foreign relations armed 
services and intelligence committees 
im very optimistic about finishing this matter said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan who noted that the areas of 
disagreement had been whittled down to two or three im 
confident that everybody is going in the same direction he said 
the senate on a vote of 960 today approved an amendment 
incorporating into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago in 
geneva by secretary of state george shultz and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze dealing with warheads using 
futuristic technology and clarifying onsite verification rules 
leaders had conferred late into wednesday night in an effort to 
settle what appeared to be the thorniest dispute one between the 
administration and the senate over possible future reinterpretation 
of the treaty 
were not there yet but weve made a good deal of progress 
said majority leader robert byrd dwva 
a key to progress on the treaty was the decision on wednesday by 
the leading opponent of the pact sen jesse helms rnc to drop 
his delaying tactics helms said he did so in the face of a 
probable vote by the senate to shut off debate 
that was the end of it helms conceded in a floor speech 
ive had no illusions about defeating this treaty the american 
people are beginning to understand that this is a dangerous 
treaty 
helms concession ended more than a week of delay and raised 
hopes that the accord could be approved in time to be shipped to 
moscow so that president reagan could formally exchange 
ratification documents with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at 
the summit meeting that begins sunday 
the primary remaining issue did not affect the treaty itself 
but the modified conditions under which the senate would grant its 
consent 
democrats sought to attach a condition stipulating that any 
attempt by a future president to reinterpret the treaty would have 
to be approved by the senate in order to become effective 
backers of the change have said it is an attempt to preserve the 
senates constitutional power of advise and consent on treaties 
the debate stems from a dispute with the reagan administration over 
its attempt to reinterpret the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to 
permit more latitude in developing reagans star wars missile 
defense 
that treaty with the soviet union was the last armscontrol pact 
to win senate approval 
the treaty on intermediaterange nuclear forces which reagan 
and gorbachev signed in washington on dec 8 requires elimination 
within three years of us and soviet nuclear missiles with a range 
of 300 miles to 3400 miles it would result in the elimination of 
867 us missiles in europe and elimination of 1752 soviet 
missiles 
while the treaty is regarded as militarily insignificant because 
it leaves most of both sides nuclear arsenals intact it holds 
potentially great political significance as a model for a followup 
treaty to provide for deep cuts in longrange nuclear missiles 
as leaders wrangled throughout the day wednesday in an effort to 
clear remaining procedural hurdles the senate approved a pair of 
relatively mild amendments to the accord and overwhelmingly 
defeated two others 
on a voice vote the lawmakers approved a nonbinding provision 
urging negotiators in future talks on reductions in longrange 
missile arsenals not to give up the us right to maintain stocks 
of conventionally armed air and sealaunched cruise missiles 
and the senate urged the president to keep human rights in the 
forefront of ussoviet relations and insist on sustained and 
demonstrable human rights progress that language was added on a 
voice vote 
helms was rebuffed in an attempt to add a provision stipulating 
that if either side provided materially misleading or false 
data the other side would be free to withdraw from the treaty 
the amendment failed on a vote of 899 
and sen ernest hollings dsc failed on a 6928 vote to win 
an exemption from the ban for conventionally armed cruise missiles 
hollings argued that keeping such missiles in the allied arsenal 
would help offset warsaw pact superiority in conventional forces 
but opponents pointed out it would be impossible to verify that the 
missiles were not nucleartipped

seismic technology is sensitive enough to 
confidently monitor all but the smallest soviet underground nuclear 
tests a congressional scientific study said thursday 
the conclusions could help to reach a ban on all underground 
testing one of the unresolved issues between the two superpowers 
said rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee 
fascell called the study an important contribution to the 
effort to develop a test ban 
the study carried out by the office of technology assessment 
an arm of congress was released as president reagan rested in 
helsinki finland while en route to the soviet union 
reagan will travel to moscow this weekend for his fourth summit 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and one of the issues on 
the agenda is underground nuclear testing 
the two leaders are expected to sign a pair of protocols 
designed to improve monitoring procedures 
openair tests are banned by a 1963 treaty while two separate 
treaties signed in 1974 and 1976 limit underground tests to 150 
kilotons both sides claim to adhere to the 1970s accords although 
neither treaty has been formally ratified by the us senate 
reagan has promised to submit the pacts to the senate if 
adequate verification procedures can be worked out the two 
protocols will set the ground rules for joint experiments this 
summer in nevada and semipalatinsk to measure the force of 
detonations 
the soviets want to use seismic monitoring systems similar to 
the kind used to watch for earthquakes the united states prefers a 
system known as corrtex which involves inserting a cable in a 
shaft about 30 feet from the test hole and taking measuresment from 
it 
the ota study said seismology now provides a means to monitor 
underground nuclear explosions down to low yields even when 
strenuous attempts are made to evade the monitoring systems by 
doing so seismology plays a central role in verifying arms control 
agreements that limit the testing of nuclear weapons 
seismic monitoring systems even if none of the stations are in 
the soviet union can readily monitor tests down to the 10kiloton 
level with high confidence the study said 
in fact expert opinion about the lowest yields that could 
reliably be monitored ranges from 1 kiloton to 10 kilotons the 
study said 
one kiloton has the explosive force of 1000 tons of tnt the 
us atomic bomb dropped aug 6 1945 on hiroshima japan had an 
explosive force of about 20 kilotons 
once a seismic signal is detected by the underground monitoring 
stations ota said its source could be reliably tracked down 
over 90 percent of all seismic events in the ussr can be 
classified as earthquakes simply becuase they are either toop dee 
or not in a plausible location for a nuclear explosion the study 
said the combination of all methods when applied in a 
comprehensive approach can differentiate between with explosions 
down to low yields and earthquakes 
the report also looked at a comprehensive test ban saying it 
could be considered adequately verifiable if it were determined 
that the advantage of such a treaty would outweigh the significance 
of any undetected clandestine testing belo the monitoring 
threshold 
a total test ban has long been a goal of us arms control 
advocates and the soviets have recently backed such a restriction 
for 18 months ending in february 1987 the soviets unilaterally 
suspended all testing but the reagan administration declined to 
join the moratorium 
in each of the past two years the house has voted to ban atomic 
tests above the onekilton level but the senate rejected such a 
ban and the white house has strongly opposed the limitation 
ota suggested that a phased approach could be adopted setting 
the first step at 10 kilotons 
this is a level that can currently be well monitored 
seismically the study said

leaders started a new round of talks today aimed at ending their 
6year war and the rebels said they were proposing a peace plan 
focusing on democratic reforms 
the rebels who have been supported by the us government said 
they would lay down their arms and rejoin the political life of the 
country if the sandinistas guarantee democratization 
at the center of the proposal is the demand that the sandinistas 
ease their control over the army and government the rebels also 
known as contras also ask for constitional reforms freedom of 
expression and freedom of the press 
we are not optimistic however said alfredo cesar leader 
of the nicaraguan resistance rebel delegation 
gen humberto ortega the nations defense minister led the 
government delegation to the third round of toplevel peace talks 
held in managua 
tight security was in effect at the camino real hotel where the 
negotiators met the witnesses are roman catholic cardinal miguel 
obando y bravo and joao baena soares secretary general of the 
organization of american states 
the rebel plan sets a flexible timetable that eventually would 
have contra fighters lay down their arms before christmas 
the government said it was ready to offer political reforms to 
guarantee clean elections it offered to give congressional 
representation to parties not in the national assembly to set a 
timetable for municipal and other elections and to change the 
makeup of the electoral council to assure pluralistic 
representation 
cesar told reporters late wednesday we have come here to 
present a comprehensive proposal to the government for a global 
solution to the war 
the rebels he said were prepared to make a special effort to 
achieve a definitive ceasefire 
but he said he was not optimistic because the government has not 
complied with a preliminary peace plan worked out march 23 in 
sapoa a small village on the costa rican border 
the rebel delegation arrived wednesday evening ending a dispute 
over where the talks would be held 
the rebels had refused to return to managua the site of two 
previous sessions they complained the government restricted their 
access to opposition political leaders 
the government insisted the talks be held in the capital and 
agreed to let the rebels meet with the opposition nicaraguan 
democratic coordinate and visit the roman catholic bishops 
conference the opposition newspaper la prensa and relatives 
col enrique bermudez the rebel military leader arrived from 
tegucigalpa honduras to take part in the negotiations marking 
his first trip to managua since the war started in late 1981 
my presence here is due to the fact that im a nicaraguan and 
that im opposed to the state of affairs in nicaragua he told a 
news conference 
i have come here to try to see sapoa fulfilled to discuss a 
ceasefire and an end to the war because this is my country he 
said 
in washington wilson morris an aide to house speaker jim 
wright dtexas said on tuesday the rebels planned to offer to 
disarm themselves by sept 1 
the two sides earlier agreed to a 60day ceasefire to give them 
time to arrange a permanent truce the ceasefire was to expire on 
may 30 but president daniel ortega announced earlier in the week 
that he would extend it for an additional 30 days 
cesar told reporters the rebels do not want repeated extensions 
of the ceasefire but rather a permanent halt to the fighting 
if the ceasefire ends on may 30 he said the rebels will take 
up defensive positions but will not break the truce 
ortega says the war has killed 26500 people and caused 3 
billion in damage to the economy 
a major obstacle to agreement has been the question of how 
nonlethal aid will be delivered to rebels gathered in ceasefire 
zones inside nicaragua 
under the sapoa agreement the aid was to come through a neutral 
international organization contras insisted in the talks that they 
had the right to choose the organization 
contra leaders were quoted as saying they would accept a 
proposal for delivery of humanitarian aid to their forces inside 
nicaragua by an agency with ties to the organization of american 
states

a small southern baptist college has won a 
reprieve from liquidation but will have to come up with a plan by 
june 3 to repay its 20 million debt a federal judge has ordered 
bankruptcy judge robert mcguire acted in response to a motion 
from bishop colleges attorneys to quash his march order that would 
have changed the colleges status from chapter 11 reorganization to 
chapter 7 liquidation as of wednesday that would have closed the 
107yearold predominantly black school 
mcguire said wednesday he would set a hearing on the 
reorganization plan for creditors for the week of june 27 with a 
confirmation hearing the week of july 25 
the plan would take effect aug 15 and school officials promised 
they would raise enough money to pay for the entire 198889 school 
year officials said without that money in hand bishop would not 
open in the fall 
in order for the community to regain confidence we need to 
show we are fiscally responsible said trip finley a bishop 
attorney but we not only have to convince our creditors but 
also the southern baptist association he said bishop will be 
reevaluated by the association this fall for its accreditation 
in march mcguire ruled the 300student college could remain 
open on the condition officials raised at least 50000 every two 
weeks the ruling further stipulated that without a substantial 
change in the colleges finances bishop would be ordered to 
liquidate its assets to repay 20 million owed 400 creditors 
school officials say bishop has raised more than 617000 in two 
months and has pledges for 158000 more 
finley said it will take seven to 10 years to repay all the 
schools debts 
the college has failed to meet chapter 11 obligations to keep 
all bills current said george mcelreath the us trustee 
overseeing the case but he conceded the school had complied with 
the 50000 bimonthly payments since march and officials seemed 
willing to work out the remaining debt 
judith swift who represents the faculty and staff committee 
said she was concerned that faculty members had not been paid about 
500000 in back salary and wages 
but finley said a 125000 payment to the salaries was made 
wednesday and that school officials hoped to pay 122000 more 
the usual payroll from the next funds received

an feb agent told a congressional hearing 
today the government did not entrap us district judge alcee l 
hastings when it was investigating allegations of bribery involving 
him and a washington lawyer 
william j murphy jr who headed the fbis investigation in the 
case said the federal government attempted to determine the truth 
of the allegations made by an informant who said washington lawyer 
william a borders had bragged that he could bribe several judges 
including hastings 
we were only trying to prove or disprove what the informant 
said murphy told a house judiciary subcommittee holding 
impeachment hearings on hastings 
rep patrick l swindall rga said the fbi had no evidence 
against hastings only the informants statement about borders 
isnt this a classic textbook entrapment he asked 
borders was arrested after an undercover agent allegedly gave 
him 120000 in 100 bills in washington to bribe hastings into 
giving a lenient sentence to two men on trial before him in miami 
would there have been a crime had the federal government not 
given borders the money swindall asked 
murphy said borders approached the informant and he laid out 
to him what he would be able to do 
murphy said the undercover meeting with borders when the money 
was exchanged was a tool to respond to the informants 
allegations if borders didnt show up at the meeting and didnt 
say the things he did the case would have stopped 
the information we were trying to prove or disprove was that 
borders and judge hastings were going to do a crime he said 
we didnt decide one day in the office to get judge hastings 
borders refused to testify wednesday at a house judiciary 
subcommittees televised impeachment proceedings against hastings 
citing his fifth amendment guarantee against selfincrimination 
after serving 33 months of a fiveyear sentence in federal 
prison paying a 35000 fine and being disbarred by the district 
of columbia court of appeals borders said i believe that my 
legal debt to society expired on may 22 1988 after my release 
from parole 
rep john conyers jr dmich the chairman of the inquiry 
said the subcommittee will decide later whether to grant borders 
immunity from prosecution and compel his testimony 
hastings was acquitted five years ago of conspiring with borders 
to solicit a bribe from two convicted racketeers frank and tom 
romano in exchange for the promise of a lenient sentence 
but a special fivejudge investigative panel of the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals concluded in september 1986 there was 
clear and convincing evidence that hastings committed the crime 
and tried to conceal his role by lying under oath and manufacturing 
evidence at his trial 
hastings insists that he knew nothing of the bribery plot and 
accuses borders of using his name in an attempt to shake down the 
romano brothers 
hastings was allowed wednesday to crossexamine the two fellow 
judges who filed misconduct charges against him six weeks after his 
acquittal 
one of them us district judge william terrell hodges of 
tampa fla said it was a gutwrenching decision to file the 
complaint and us district judge anthony a alaimo of brunswick 
ga said hodges was on the verge of tears 
retorted hastings ive cried a lot tony 
hastings who is floridas first black federal judge has 
charged repeatedly that his prosecution was racially and 
politically motivated but hodges told the subcommittee that 
hastings race had absolutely not any bearing on his decision 
to file a complaint 
conyers laying the groundwork for murphys testimony said it 
was amazing that fbi agents arrested borders and seized 
125000 in bribe money before borders had a chance to pass it 
along to anyone else 
hastings was staying at a hotel a couple of miles away when 
borders was arrested oct 9 1981 inside a car with the payoff 
money supplied by an fbi undercover agent posing as frank romano 
the judicial panel said that when hastings learned of borders 
arrest he hurriedly flew back to miami from a baltimore airport 
because he wanted to avoid questioning by fbi agents 
john doar chief counsel to the judicial panel said there was 
sufficient circumstantial evidence to implicate hastings in a 
conspiracy but he agreed with rep don edwards dcalif that the 
case against hastings would have been almost impregnable if he 
had actually received bribe money from borders 
a few hours after borders arrest hastings was to have appeared 
at a boating party given by lawyer friends in borders honor

a potent cancerfighting can safely relieve 
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in patients unresponsive to other 
medication a doctor reported today 
the drug methotrexate has been used to treat arthritis in the 
past but daily use is thought to cause cirhosis of the liver 
dr james e brick assistant professor of medicine at west 
virginia university school of medicine said in a report at a 
meeting of the american rheumatism association that weekly doses of 
the drug were found to be safe in a 198087 study of 96 patients 
mild and moderate amounts of fat and inflammation were found to 
be common in the livers of patients with rheumatoid arthritis even 
before they were treated with methotrexate brick said 
after treatment these abnormalities increased in some 
patients but seemed to decrease in others brick said none of 
the patients developed cirrhosis as a result of methotrexate 
therapy 
we believe our data indicates that methotrexate can be safely 
given from an hepatic standpoint to selected patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis for a period of several years he said 
treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis ordinarily 
involves a combination of medication physical therapy education 
and surgery 
patients that are unresponsive or intolerant to the simplest 
drugs progressively receive more potent medications such as 
methotrexate

the soviet union today abruptly 
canceled one of president reagans meetings with general secretary 
mikhail s gorbachev and questioned the composition of a religious 
group scheduled to meet with reagan in moscow 
but a white house spokesman said the session at the danilov 
monastery was going to proceed as scheduled the spokesman 
roman popadiuk said the decision to scrub one of reagans meetings 
with gorbachev was mutual 
however on the presidents flight wednesday from washington 
chief spokesman marlin fitzwater put the cancellation differently 
he said the soviets had suggested dropping a meeting and the us 
side was trying to clarify the reason 
despite the white houses efforts to smooth over any 
differences the schedule change and rumors that the soviets were 
attempting to restrict access to reagan contributed a measure of 
uncertainty to his fourth summit meeting with the general secretary 
reagan meanwhile passed the day relaxing and keeping his 
distance from the hundreds of reporters following in his footsteps 
a brief press notice said reagan and his wife nancy strolled 
along a lake near their guest house during the 30minute walk the 
president skipped stones along the water the press release said 
the session called off because of what the soviets cited as 
some internal function was one of five that reagan had 
scheduled over four days with his gorbachev 
overall the president still will spend six hours with the 
soviet leader because the remaining sessions will be expanded said 
fitzwater 
i regard it as routine fitzwater said as reagan spent the 
day in seclusion at a government guesthouse making preparations for 
his talks in moscow 
the summit encountered another glitch when word reached the 
presidential party taking a rest stop in finland that the soviets 
had questioned the participation of one of the religious groups due 
to meet with reagan at a monestary on monday 
the meeting itself is still on as far as i know fitzwater 
said he said he did not know which religious group might be 
excluded 
reagan also plans to meet separately with a group of jewish 
refuseniks who had been unable to obtain exit permits for 
israel fitzwater said he was unable to verify a report that two of 
them had been intercepted by soviet authorities on their way to 
moscow from leningrad 
on the official level the soviets have shown no concern over 
the meeting planned between reagan and soviet refuseniks at a 
press conference to discuss the forthcoming summit us affairs 
expert georgy a arbatov and communist party central committee 
official nikolai shishlin both stated that they considered reagans 
meeting partners his own business 
reagans first visit to the country he once denounced as the 
evil empire was already clouded by failure of a us effort to 
oust gen manuel antonio noriega the military ruler of panama 
after the summit gorbachev will preside at the first 
fullfledged communist party conference since 1941 but there was 
no immediate word on whether the cancellation of the second of 
reagangorbachev sessions on monday had any connection with the 
party meetings 
for the soviets the party conference has tended to overshadow 
reagans fourth summit meeting with gorbachev since it will serve 
as a test of the soviet leaders economic reform policies and his 
three years at the kremlin helm 
at the same time the summit itself has lost any expectation of 
major results with the failure of us and soviet negotiators to 
complete a treaty to sharply reduce longrange nuclear weapons 
reagan and gorbachev had hoped to make such an accord the 
centerpiece of the 77yearold presidents first trip to moscow 
in an interview tuesday with a group of west european 
jouralists reagan left open the possibility of a fifth summit with 
gorbachev before he leaves office in january if negotiators can 
complete the treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons 
i wont rule it out reagan said in a text released here 
today i wont say its impossible i would hope that we can 
iron out the still undecided points before i leave 
secretary of state george p shultz joined reagan on his summit 
trip early today carrying a full report on the collapse of 
negotiations to remove noriega from power 
shultz was greeted briefly and without ceremony by finnish 
foreign minister kalevi sorsa before climbing into a black 
limousine for the 15minute ride to the guest house where reagan 
was staying 
i dont feel weakened reagan had assured reporters after 
his postmidnight landing but he seemed disappointed and at a 
loss on what he might try next to force out noriega 
shultz had stayed behind to supervise the negotiations held in 
panama between michael g kozak of the state department and noriega 
apparently the generals aides had given the impression the 
deal would go through but noriega turned kozak down and the 
emissary was ordered home 
it seemed for a time as if he had some plan reagan said 
of noriega his voice trailing off but evidently he changed his 
mind about this 
asked what he might do next reagan said thats going to take 
some studying and consultation 
evidently any serious planning will have to take a back seat to 
the moscow summit and reagans first visit to the soviet union 
beginning on sunday 
in any event fitzwater said no other negotiations are 
planned no agreement has been left on the table 
fitzwater said us economic sanctions against panama would 
remain in place 
earlier fitzwater seemed to expect a positive outcome in the 
negotiations we can hear something at any time he told 
reporters aboard air force one 
under the proposed deal noriega would have left panama this 
summer and not returned until after elections were held in may 1989 
the president also was hoping for word from capitol hill that 
the senate had ratified his treaty to abolish us and soviet 
nuclear missiles in the range of 300 miles to 3400 miles 
another key aide howard h baker jr the white house chief of 
staff stayed behind to oversee maneuvering by senate democratic 
and republican leaders to choke off debate and bring reagans only 
nuclear arms control agreement to a vote before the president opens 
talks with general secretary mikhail s gorbachev on sunday 
if the administrations strategy is successful baker will fly 
the ratified pact to moscow on saturday so reagan and gorbachev can 
have a formal exchange of the documents 
the supreme soviet the nominal parliament endorsed the treaty 
on monday and sent it to the presidium the highest executive body 
for ratification viktor p karpov head of the foreign ministrys 
arms control office said the soviets should not ratify the treaty 
before the united states 
in a predeparture interview with a group of foreign reporters 
reagan said he still believed a treaty to cut strategic nuclear 
weapons could be completed during the eight months that remain in 
his term 
but he said that would require hard work and constructive 
negotiating by both sides 
he said his overarching goal was to bequeath to my successor 
next january the firm basis for a stable sustainable relationship 
with the soviet union

suspects

allahu akhbar god is great as he plunged in the knife 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip where a palestinian 
rebellion began dec 8 the army lifted curfews on eight villages 
and refugee camps curfews remained in effect on idna village and 
the dheishe refugee camp in the west bank

aid and taken to a hospital with the knife still in his back

leaders of the senate commerce committee on 
thursday introduced a bill to provide 75 million annually for a 
threeyear radio and television advertising campaign aimed at 
reducing demand for illegal drugs 
the broadcasting industry branded some provisions of the 
legislation unconstitutional 
the media blitz would have the intensity of a presidential 
advertising campaign said sen john danforth of missouri 
ranking republican on the panel who introduced the bill with sen 
ernest hollings dsc committee chairman 
when people turn on their tv in the evening we want them to 
see at least once during the evening a commercial that is very 
hardhitting about the drug issue danforth said at a news 
conference 
under the measure the national telecommunications and 
information administration in the commerce department would oversee 
production of the ads and buy time to air them on commercial radio 
and tv stations nationwide 
the bill would authorize 75 million a year over three years for 
the program broadcasters would be required to provide the 
government reasonable access to all time periods to air the spots 
and to charge their lowest rates 
the national association of broadcasters said the bill is 
unconstitutional because it mandates government access to broadcast 
facilities 
broadcasters support antidrug efforts and already contribute 
more than 1 billion a year in air time and facilities to the 
antidrug campaign said nab president edward o fritts 
hollings cited precedents for the federal government advertising 
on radio and tv including the armed forces recruiting ads and 
promotions for amtrak but the nab said that in none of those cases 
is a broadcast station required by law to accept an ad 
danforth said an antidrug ad campaign should be at least as 
successful as antismoking campaigns which have had to compete 
against counteradvertising by the tobacco industry and relied 
mostly on public service announcements 
despite the obstacles antismoking campaigns produced a 25 
percent decline in cigarette smoking among americans over the past 
two decades he said

iranian gunboats today attacked a 
norwegianoperated oil tanker in the strait of hormuz and set it 
ablaze 
persian gulfbased shipping executives identified the stricken 
tanker as the 15530ton liquefied petroleum gas carrier mundogas 
rio and said it was fully laden and sailing out of the hormuz when 
attacked 
it was the third attack by the iranians on neutral shipping 
since washington broadened the duties of the us navy in the gulf 
allowing warships to intervene in attacks on commercial vessels 
even if they were sailing under flags other than the stars and 
stripes 
the executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
were not aware of any us warships in the area at the time of the 
attack 
they said the captain of the vessel which flies the liberian 
flag reported a small fire aboard the vessel but no casualties 
among the crew 
two salvage tugboats in the vicinity rushed out to the help the 
tanker they said 
the attacks are an offshoot of the 7yearold iraniraq war

separation benefits paid 4500 employees who 
lost their jobs with the conrail railroad are fully taxable the 
us tax court ruled thursday 
the court held in a test case involving two of the laidoff 
workers that the benefits are not unemployment compensation which 
would have exempted part of them from tax have not been granted a 
specific exemption by congress and must be fully included in income 
subject to tax 
the benefits were authorized by congress as part of a 1982 law 
aimed at cutting the expenses of conrail which took over seven 
bankrupt railroads in the northeast and midwest 
the ruling came in the cases of john roberts martin of girard 
ohio and bernard j spanski of hudson ohio both of whom were 
laid off by conrail in 1982 and filed claims for subsistence 
allowances 
spanski chose an option under which he gave up all seniority 
rights in exchange for a lumpsum payment of 20000 martin 
elected a second option under which he retained his seniority was 
listed as furloughed and received a daily subsistence allowance 
reimbursement for moving expenses and other benefits with the 
package limited to 20000 
no money was withheld from either allowance and neither martin 
nor spansky received a w2 form at yearend listing income received 
during the year in may 1984 the two laidoff workers received a 
notice from the railroad retirement board announcing that the 
internal revenue service had ruled that such benefits except for 
health and welfare premiums were fully taxable 
after the irs billed martin and spansky for back taxes on the 
payments they challenged the action in tax court the parties 
agreed that the outcome of their cases would determine those of 
other laidoff conrail employees

faye dunaway says her performance as an icy 
manipulative joan crawford in mommie dearest was too believable 
for her own good but her portrayal of an alcoholic in barfly 
may have helped save her career 
i was too good as crawford she said in an interview 
published in the june 13 issue of us magazine i think that 
changed the notion of who i was it created a kind of monstrous 
element which i dont think had been part of my life before 
in barfly she said she was able to show the results of 
analysis in which she learned to relax as a person 
im more accepting of my vulnerability now she said ive 
always had enormous insecurity but i was always frightened of 
showing that before so i sort of hid behind whatever kind of 
facade i could 
in her newest film midnight cruising ms dunaway plays an 
ophthalmologist blinded by glaucoma which required her to learn 
what sightlessness is like 
hearing became very important she said she her 
character was always seeing with her ears it makes you 
realize how lucky you are

two white policemen were 
sentenced thursday to hang for the murder of a young black man who 
was beaten and then shot through the head after drunken officers 
went on a blackbashing expedition 
they are the first white policemen in south africa to face 
execution for crimes committed while on duty in a black township 
only six whites ever have been hanged here for killing blacks 
the pivotal testimony against warrant officer leon de villiers 
37 and constable david goosen 27 came from other members of 
their 10man riot unit who abandoned a coverup attempt after being 
pressured by investigators 
several officers testified that de villiers the unit leader 
ordered goosen to take out mlungisi stuurman because the youth 
had been beaten too severely to be set free stuurman 18 was led 
to a river bank and shot in the back of the head on july 26 1986 
in the black section of cradock in eastern cape province 
the nonjury trial took place in the supreme court at 
grahamstown near cradock 
goosen and de villiers stood impassively as the sentence was 
read their wives and some court employees broke into tears their 
lawyer expressed his clients regret for stuurmans death and the 
officers were embraced by relatives and fellow policemen before 
being led away 
there was no date set for the execution 
justice nw zietsman convicted the two men wednesday agreeing 
with prosecutors that de villiers had led his unit on a 
blackbashing expedition in which residents were assaulted 
indiscriminately 
on thursday zietsman rejected the mitigation arguments 
presented by the defense and also refused to grant permission for 
the defendants to appeal the sentence 
de villiers lawyer chris jansen had said his client was of 
below average intelligence and was drunk at the time of the 
shooting jansen said the defendants deserved sympathy because they 
had been living with a sword over their heads for two years 
goosen testified that he suffered from posttraumatic stress 
disorder because of repeated exposure to violence in black 
townships he also said he had an unhappy childhood during which he 
was taunted because of his dark complexion 
according to testimony during the trial members of de villiers 
squad drank heavily conducted a bloodoath ceremony swearing 
themselves to secrecy then entered the township at about 3 am 
and assaulted several blacks 
following another bout of drinking at their base the squad 
returned to the township after daybreak 
stuurman who was wearing a tshirt bearing the slogan forward 
to peoples power was chased and grabbed by officers when he 
tried to walk away from them then was assaulted several officers 
testified 
the officers said de villiers ordered that stuurman should be 
taken out because of the severity of his injuries 
the defendants contended that the shooting was an accident de 
villiers said he did not report the incident immediately because he 
was still under the influence of alcohol 
stuurmans father jimmy and his 21yearold brother dan said 
in interviews last week in cradock that they could not forgive the 
policemen they were not in court this week 
dan stuurman who was present in 1986 when the officers grabbed 
his brother from their yard and forced him into a van recalled 
testifying against de villiers and goosen 
i can still remember their faces very clearly and when i had 
to give evidence in court and i saw them again i felt dizzy and 
had to be taken outside 
mlungisi was a good boy said jimmy stuurman 63 even 
while i am sitting here i can see his face

japan must quickly reach agreement on lowering 
import barriers to us beef or face retaliatory action a montana 
senator said thursday 
japan has been saying for weeks that theyll come up with an 
agreement but it has not come home with the bacon sen max 
baucus dmont told a news conference also attended by us trade 
representative clayton k yeutter 
unless japan moves swiftly to drop barriers to beef imports the 
united states is likely to begin steps that could lead to 
retaliation baucus said 
an agreement under which the united states accepted japanese 
quotas on its exports of beef expired march 31 since then the 
countries have been deadlocked on us demands for an end to the 
curbs and no increase in tariffs 
japan already represents the largest export market for american 
beef in 1986 us beef exporters sold 500 million worth of the 
product to the japanese 
the agriculture department estimates however that sales could 
be expanded dramatically if japan would eliminate its quota system 
that limits imports of restaurant grade beef for example to 
58400 tons usda says exports might increase to 2 billion without 
the restrictions 
yeutter said it was just imperative that the government of 
japan and the people of japan commit themselves to true market 
liberalization he said the system of restrictions was not 
mildly protectionist it is blatantly protectionist 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo who like baucus is a member of the 
senate finance subcommittee on international trade reiterated that 
the united states was not asking for a guaranteed market 
weve never asked for a guaranteed market wallop said 
were asking for guaranteed access to that market 
he emphasized that japanese beef prices are far above those in 
the united states because of the restrictions 
they are cheating their own consumers wallop said they 
are actually stealing from their own consumers 
the massive trade bill that congress recently passed contains a 
nonbinding provision expressing the sense of the senate that the 
japanese should drop their barriers to us beef and citrus imports

recovered by the workers from the complex on wednesday 
in new delhi president ramaswamy venkataraman promulgated an 
ordinance to prevent religious institutions from being used by 
radicals and political parties 
the ordinance bans the use of religious places for campaigns 
against the state and calls for five years of hard labor for 
violators government officials said 
the golden temple is the sikhs holiest shrine militant sikhs 
have been fighting for a separate state in the northern punjab 
region where they form a majority 
the workers in amritsar on thursday were joined by relatives of

a former university of minnesota official 
indicted in the disappearance of some 186000 is believed to have 
fled the country authorities say 
county attorney tom johnson announced wednesday that a grand 
jury had returned indictments against luther darville who was 
fired last month by the universitys office of minority and special 
student affairs 
johnson said authorities believe he is in the bahamas 
we will immediately begin pursuing a federal warrant for 
unlawful flight johnson said he is from the bahamas he has 
family there 
if darville is found in the bahamas extradition could be a 
lengthy process johnson said 
darville was fired after a university audit showed 186000 
missing from the office of minority and special student affairs 
since 1983 darville told auditors he had given money to 17 
minority students including nine football players 
evidence shows darville used some of the money himself johnson 
said he said he didnt know how much of the money was spent on 
athletes or other students 
one former student athlete valdez earl baylor told the star 
tribune that darville gave him about 5000 in cash over a sixyear 
period he said the money was handed to him in envelopes 
baylor 24 who played football for the university from 1982 to 
1985 said he received money on several occasions and used it 
to fly home to harrisburg pa to pay rent and to buy food 
asked if he thought the arrangement might be illegal baylor 
said at that time it didnt even matter to me as long as it 
was understood that i didnt have to pay any of the money back 
if they keep pursuing it theres going to be a lot more 
information about the athletic department baylor went on some 
of the fellows might be willing to speak out later on if they get 
angry and tell the real story it stems deeper than darville 
giving out money 
he declined to elaborate 
the national collegiate athletic association rules prohibit 
the award of financial aid to a studentathlete that exceeds 
commonly accepted educational expenses ie tuition and fees 
room and board and required courserelated books other than 
legitimate loans based upon a regular repayment schedule 
available to all students and administered on the same basis for 
all students 
james lawton darvilles attorney has said darville broke no 
laws and said he had never denied that darville had assisted 
athletes 
university attorney bill donohue said the school was uncertain 
whether ncaa rules had been violated donohue said the county 
attorney had requested that the university hold off investigating 
possible violations 
ncaa officials said they had no comment on the case the 
schools athletic director paul giel also had no comment

appealing for an increase in foreign aid 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead told senators thursday 
that other countries increasingly see us military bases as a 
liability rather than an asset 
this is a disturbing situation he said 
whitehead mentioned greece portugal turkey and the 
philippines in all of which the united states is negotiating on 
the future of its bases 
the house on wednesday approved a bill to provide 143 billion 
in aid for the fiscal year beginning sept 30 the final amount 
will depend on agreement between the house and senate 
the administration is asking for a 37 percent increase in 
military aid with all equipment being transferred for the first 
time as grants rather than loans 
loans only add to our allies burden of debt which may not be 
repaid anyway whitehead said 
he was testifying before the foreign operations subcommittee of 
the senate appropriations committee 
whitehead said an overall aid increase of 2 percent over this 
years level is needed to restore funds for key programs in 
portugal south america the caribbean and africa which either got 
no money this year or were drastically cut 
we cannot expect others to be dependable friends if we cannot 
be one ourselves he said 
edward j derwinski undersecretary of state for security 
assistance said there is no debate about the need of the 
philippines for aid 
as a newly restored democracy an ally and a country facing a 
dangerous communist insurgency the philippines is looking for 
significantly higher assistance levels from the united states its 
principal security partner he said 
lt gen charles w brown in charge of foreign aid at the 
pentagon called the request of 110 million for the philippines a 
reasonable amount saying that it was 15 million less than 
congress earmarked for this year 
in addition the amount of assistance that the philippine 
armed forces can optimally absorb this year is limited he said 
the philippines requires a great deal of assistance to resolve 
its security problems but it should be applied in the context of 
an efficient and reliable longterm program 
whitehead questioned whether 45 million asked for afghanistan 
will be enough as five million afghan refugees in pakistan and iran 
seek to return to their homes following the withdrawal of soviet 
troops

black south african guerrilla 
leaders and white opponents of apartheid sharply disagreed thursday 
over the use of violence to attain their common goal but they 
pledged to hold further talks 
four representatives of the african national congress met in 
frankfurt with eight members of south africas national democratic 
movement 
the meeting occurred the same day as two bomb blasts in pretoria 
four people were injured in the blasts which south africas 
justice minister blamed on the anc the anc is the largest 
guerrilla group fighting south africas whiteled government 
wynand malan a member of south africas parliament and the 
leader of the national democratic movement delegation was asked if 
the two sides had discussed violence carried out by the guerrillas 
to promote their goals 
we voiced not only our position but our difference to that 
strategy malan told reporters after the meeting 
we also got an explanation from them again as to the origin of 
the armed struggle we can understand from their perspective 
exactly what they are saying but from our position we are still 
fundamentally in disagreement to it malan said 
the guerrilla group based in lusaka zambia wages a bombing 
and sabotage campaign in its bid to oust south africas government 
by law and custom south african apartheid establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services 
in a joint statement after thursdays meeting the two groups 
said common ground was found in relation to the kind of south 
africa we would like to see however there were important 
differences with respect to some aspects of the strategy through 
which this could be achieved 
also attending the press conference was thabo mbeki spokesman 
for the guerrilla group in west germany 
he defended use of force by the group which was outlawed by 
south africa in 1960 
that left us no choice but to take up arms if those 
conditions were to change then of course the issue of whether to 
continue or not continue the armed struggle would be 
reconsidered mbeki said 
malan earlier defended the decision to meet the four executive 
committee members of the guerrilla organization this is a normal 
further discussion with the anc seeking a common ground and 
strategies out of the impasse in south africa he told the 
associated press at an interview in a frankfurt hotel 
its the national democratic movements policy to meet with 
all political groupings said malan 
he said the goal of the meeting was to seek common ground 
with the black resistance movement 
malan said west germany was chosen as the meeting site because 
it was the quickest access to a mutually convenient venue 
the two sides at the frankfurt meeting agreed to hold more 
talks though no date was given

us district judge alcee l hastings of miami 
was a target of an fbi bribery conspiracy investigation from its 
very beginning a congressional panel conducting impeachment 
proceedings against the jurist was told thursday 
fbi agent william j murphy jr who directed the investigation 
said an informant william dredge told the agency that william a 
borders a washington lawyer and close friend of hastings had 
bragged that he could bribe several judges including hastings 
murphy said the fbi had an undercover agent meet with borders in 
the fall of 1981 to discuss the possibility of bribing hastings 
who was then hearing a case involving two convicted racketeers 
frank and tom romano in miami 
we were only trying to prove or disprove what dredge said 
murphy told the house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice 
later he said the undercover agent met with borders and gave 
him 120000 as a partial payment to hastings in return for a 
lenient sentence to the romanos and a return of a major portion of 
seized assets 
borders was arrested after the money changed hands he was 
convicted in 1982 of arranging a 150000 bribe for hastings was 
sentenced to five years in prison and was fined 35000 he served 
33 months in the allenwood pa federal prison and 27 months on 
parole and was subsequently disbarred by the district of columbia 
court of appeals 
hastings was acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges 
murphy said hastings was a target from the outset his name 
was mentioned by borders we tried to prove or disprove the 
allegation and it turned out to be true 
rep patrick l swindall rga asked what predisposition 
did the fbi have that judge hastings would accept a bribe 
none that i am aware of replied murphy 
swindall asked if the fbis undercover operation wasnt a 
classic textbook entrapment 
murphy denied the allegation again saying that the fbi merely 
investigated dredges charges to learn whether they were true or 
false 
he said borders made the approach to the informant and he laid 
out to dredge what he would be able to do 
murphy said the undercover operation was a tool to respond to 
dredges allegations if borders didnt show up at the meeting 
and didnt say the things he did the case would have stopped 
the information we were trying to prove or disprove was that 
borders and judge hastings were going to do a crime he said 
we didnt decide one day in the office to get judge hastings 
murphy said that after arresting borders the fbi sought his 
cooperation in getting evidence on hastings borders refused to 
wear a a hidden microphone and confront the judge 
based on the information we had we believed he hastings was 
involved in the conspiracy murphy said in answer to a question 
by rep hamilton fish jr rny had borders cooperated it 
would have strengthened our case 
borders refused to testify at both his own and hastings trials 
or before the house subcommittee on wednesday he also refused to 
appear before a fivejudge investigative panel of the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals that was appointed shortly after hastings 
was acquitted 
the judicial panel concluded that there was convincing evidence 
that hastings actually took part in a bribery scheme and then 
attempted a coverup by lying under oath and manufacturing evidence 
at his trial 
the panels findings were endorsed unanimously by the judicial 
conference of the united states the chief policymaking body of the 
federal judiciary and forwarded to house leaders in march 1987 with 
the advice that consideration of impeachment may be warranted 
hastings who continues to sit on the bench in miami insists he 
knew nothing of the bribery scheme and accuses borders of using his 
name to shake down the romano brothers

a nursery owner has been awarded 26 
million for 510000 citrus trees the state destroyed in 1985 in a 
program to control what was thought to be an incurable 
fastspreading citrus canker 
a judge and sixmember jury decided wednesday the state 
department of agriculture had to pay richard o polk for burning 
his stock as part of a statewide program that destroyed millions of 
trees 
polk had asked for 3 milllion in his suit 
in a precedentsetting case in january circuit judge tim 
strickland ruled the agriculture department unnecessarily destroyed 
polks stock after scientists testified that canker had been 
misdiagnosed and there was never a real threat to the industry 
its a relief said polk thats all an american citizen 
can ask for is a fair day in court 
attorney j davis connor cocounsel for polk said he hoped the

a house panel on thursday approved a bill to 
limit the amount of advertising that may be shown during childrens 
television programs 
the house commerce and energy committee voted 393 to send the 
measure to the house floor where it is expected to win approval 
the measure is a bipartisan compromise stripped of earlier 
proposals to prohibit programs built around toy manufacturers 
products critics of these programs call them programlength 
commercials 
senate legislation on childrens tv would bar these programs 
the bill passed by the house committee would limit tv stations 
to no more than 10 minutes of commercials per hour during 
childrens shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during these 
programs on weekdays 
it also would require the federal communications commission to 
consider when deciding whether to renew a stations license 
whether the station complied with the advertising limits and served 
the educational needs of children in its overall programming 
the national association of broadcasters which has said it will 
not oppose the house measure says no stations would have 
difficulty meeting the limits in the legislation

corporations aftertax profits edged up 05 
percent in the first three months of the year a much smaller 
increase than in the last quarter of 1987 the government said 
thursday 
the commerce department said aftertax profits rose to an annual 
rate of 1464 billion following a gain of 26 percent in the 
previous quarter 
manufacturing profits were up in the first quarter with the 
chemical industry enjoying the largest increases profits in the 
transportation and utilities industries were down while those in 
financial industries showed a tiny gain 
analysts said the slowdown in profits showed that companies were 
beginning to see some pressures from rising wages and higher costs 
for component parts especially if those parts are imported 
bruce steinberg senior economist with merrill lynch in new 
york said that faced with rising demand companies are likely to 
begin boosting their prices in order to regain lost profit margins 
because of the squeeze on profits there will be an incentive 
on firms to raise their prices he said and these increases will 
add to growing inflationary pressures 
among the details in the profits report 
beforetax profits fell 18 percent in the first quarter to an 
annual level of 2806 billion after rising 02 percent in the 
fourth quarter 
corporate profits after adjusting for depreciation and 
inventories fell 1 percent to 3099 billion the second 
consecutive quarterly decline 
corporate cash flows a measurement intended to show the funds 
corporations have for investment rose 12 percent to an annual 
rate of 381 billion after a 05 percent rise in the fourth quarter

religious education will mean more than 
having a parochial school building in the parish as catholic 
educators are charting a future that emphasizes adult education and 
teaching children outside the traditional setting 
faced with continued enrollment declines educators moved toward 
a broader definition of roman catholic education during a weeklong 
symposium on their future course 
the concerns of those working with adults and with catholic 
children attending public schools dominated discussions while 
little talk was devoted to stopping the enrollment erosion at 
parochial schools 
the 300 participants in the catholic education futures project 
left unfinished the work of writing a vision statement but 
they developed a list of priorities 
sister suzanne hall an organizer said the list reflected a 
strong belief that catholic education must embrace radical 
aspects of the gospel including education for peace and justice 
respect for all cultures and elimination of racism and sexism 
twentytwo organizations sent representatives to the symposium 
at the university of dayton organized by the us catholic 
conference and the national catholic educational association 
roman catholic dioceses have lost 3 million students and 4200 
schools since 1965 last year 110 more schools closed their doors 
and enrollment fell by 103000 to 26 million in the 8992 
remaining schools 
in the united states the roman catholic church has more than 48 
million members making it the largest single body of christians in 
the nation 
by the new broader definition catholic education is not 
getting smaller its getting larger said the rev thomas 
gallagher secretary of education for the us catholic conference 
were not going out of business 
sister georgette zalewska director of adult and religious 
education for the brooklyn ny diocese said the church needs to 
move beyond that school mentality and find new ways to educate 
senior citizens adolescents and adults 
but sister patricia bauch an education professor at the 
catholic university of america who has studied largely black 
parochial schools in inner cities said the conference ignored the 
needs of parents and other catholic school consumers 
the church has come to see it is very expensive to operate 
schools and therefore is looking for other ways to educate 
people bauch said 
historically the public school child who attended weekly 
religion classes was considered a secondclass citizen said 
bishop james malone of youngstown 
but archdioceses around the country are hiring paid fulltime 
directors of religious education like janet kayser a laywoman who 
runs the programs for st thomas parish in crystal lake ill 
when the topic of catholic education comes up theres too 
much emphasis in thinking it means only schools said kayser who 
has 650 students in her programs 
the rev thomas lynch pastor of st james church in bridgeport 
conn said he is trying to rename the parish school the st james 
center for religious formation to stress prayer classes scripture 
study and other educational activities but he said his 
parishioners get nervous about such a change 
catholic schools must emphasize the teaching of faith just as 
much as geography math or anything else said lynch he said he 
sees no reason to operate a parochial school that smells like and 
looks like the public school except for maybe a course in religion 
and an amorphous catholic environment 
bishop francis schulte of west virginia who heads the bishops 
committee on education said theres no adequate substitute for 
the fullcurriculum catholic school but he acknowledged that 
very substantial areas exist where catholic parents simply 
dont have a parochial school available 
parochial schools flourished in big cities with immigrants from 
catholic lands like ireland italy and poland 
in early times we saw ourselves in kind of a fortress 
mentality to the white protestant culture that was here said 
brother raymond fitz president of the university of dayton 
when catholics became more affluent and moved to the suburbs 
churches followed but schools did not

vice president george bush proposed on 
thursday that companies lacking drugfree programs be denied 
government contracts he also called for creation of an 
international strike force to find and destroy drug crops 
a bush spokesman said the first proposal might include some form 
of mandatory drug testing 
bush in what aides described as a major antidrug initiative 
said i will make adoption of drugfree programs a condition of 
obtaining federal contracts and i will ask the states to do the 
same 
bush outlined his drug plan an expansion of previous antidrug 
proposals at a chamber of commerce breakfast in nearby secaucus 
then underscored his proposals with a visit to a drug 
rehabilitation center here where he talked with patients who had 
been drug addicts 
later he was flying to his vacation retreat in kennebunkport 
maine where he will spend a week on strategy and meetings with 
republican leaders and advisers 
on the drug issue bush said that an international strike force 
possibly under the auspices of the united nations could wipe out 
crops wherever they are grown and take out drug labs wherever they 
exist us involement would be coordinated by a military officer 
reporting to bushs vice president 
our military forces have already made a substantial 
contribution to our interdiction effort and today theyre being 
called upon to do more their primary target should be the 
production of drugs abroad he said 
bush also reiterated an earlier call for a western hemisphere 
drug summit and said he would put his vice president in charge of 
antidrug efforts 
on another topic bush also renewed his call for a federal 
special prosecutor to investigate the finances of democratic house 
speaker jim wright 
speaking to an italianamerican group at lunch bush said we 
hear a lot of flak from the democrats on current ethical problems 
in the administration an apparent reference to the legal 
investigation of attorney general edwin meese iii 
i wonder if mike dukakis and jesse jackson will join me in 
calling for the house of representatives to appoint a special 
prosecutor to look into its own troubles starting with the 
speaker he said 
the private lobbying group common cause had earlier called for 
an investigation and rep newt gingrich rga filed a formal 
complaint about wright with the house ethics committee thursday 
gingrichs complaint accompanied by a supporting letter signed 
by 71 house republicans asked for an investigation in four areas 
including published reports that wright received unusually high 
book royalities from a printing company that did business with his 
campaign committee 
in newark bush also told the italianamerican audience that 
while dukakis should be proud of his greekamerican ancestry 
hes not going to be the champion of ethnic america im going to 
be the champion of ethnic america 
bushs comments on private companies and drugs marked the first 
time he had sought to tie the war against drugs to government 
contracts 
his chief of staff craig fuller told reporters that the thrust 
of the proposal was the vice presidents notion that employers 
should do everything possible to get drugs out of the workplace 
we didnt come today to write the regulations fuller said 
however he said it was conceivable that testing of some kind 
could be part of it 
fuller said that the vice president saw a lot of merit to 
random drug testing for government contractors bush has already 
proposed mandatory testing for airline pilots prison guards and 
others who hold safetyrelated jobs 
on still another subject fuller denied that the decision of 
peter teeley to step down as bushs campaign communications 
director reflected dissension 
campaign aides said on wednesday that teeley a longtime adviser 
to bush would be reassigned to work on political issues no reason 
was given for the change 
teeley has been known to be at odds recently with fuller 
however fuller said i dont think there was a rift there 
wasnt a resignation

a court official said thursday 
that six americans who were aboard a twa jet commandeered in 1985 
and relatives of a us navy diver killed in the ordeal will help 
prosecute one of the suspected hijackers 
mohammed ali hamadi goes on trial july 5 in a speciallybuilt 
75 million courtroom on charges of air piracy and murder in the 
hijacking the americans legal intervention allows their attorneys 
to ask questions during court sessions 
during a tour to show reporters the courtroom inside frankfurts 
preungesheim prison court spokesman falk thomas said eight 
americans including six people who were on the hijacked jetliner 
had formally intervened in the prosecution 
six are former hostages the other two are relatives of 
stethem i believe the parents thomas told reporters he 
declined to provide the names 
navy diver robert stethem was shot to death during the 
hijacking his parents who live in waldorf md could not be 
immediately reached for comment 
the practice of legal intervention common in the german system 
is sometimes called acting as a private prosecutor it is 
designed to ensure that victims interests are properly represented 
in criminal trials 
it also gives the intervenors the right of appeal to a higher 
court 
they are not required to be present in the courtroom however 
thomas indicated that at least some of the americans would be here 
during to tour the court spokesman said some of those people 
who are coming as witnesses or intervenors in the prosecution could 
feel threatened and we dont want that to happen 
four armed men hijacked the plane on june 14 1985 on a flight 
from athens to rome and forced it to land in beirut thirtynine 
americans were held captive for 17 days 
us government officials have indicted hamadi but west germany 
refused to extradite him 
hamadi is in a frankfurt prison awaiting trial 
thomas the frankfurt judge acting as spokesman for the hamadi 
trial said that the construction costs of the courtroom came to 
75 million 
seats for 100 journalists and 80 members of the public are 
separated from the judges witnesses and defendant by huge plates 
of bulletproof glass the spectators will listen through a 
loudspeaker system 
thomas said the trial will start july 5 with reading of the 
indictment and a chance for hamadi to make a statement 
a juvenile court then will decide whether hamadi was under 21 
years old when the hijacking preparations started if it rules he 
was 21 or younger then hamadi would be subject to a maximum of 15 
years in prison 
if the court tries him as an adult hamadi could receive life in 
prison 
hamadi has told west german authorities he was born on june 13 
1964 but he later said he was younger 
west german and us officials believe he is 23 years old 
hamadis 29yearold brother abbas ali hamadi was sentenced by 
a duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two west 
germans in beirut in a failed attempt to gain freedom for his 
younger brother

authorities allowed an unusually large 
demonstration thursday by soviet jews who have been denied 
permission to emigrate and who urged president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev to take up their cause at the 
superpower summit 
despite the tolerance of the protest a leningrad refusenik the 
term for jews refused permission to leave the country said the kgb 
secret police has warned him against accepting an invitation to 
meet reagan on monday 
reagan plans to meet monday afternoon at spaso house the us 
ambassadors residence with the activists and refuseniks to 
underscore his concern for human rights problems the soviet 
government has not objected to the meeting 
on thursday soviet officials holding a news conference on the 
summit said who the president meets with is his business 
the us president who will be our guest in moscow is 
certainly free to decide who of soviet citizens he finds 
interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the 
official events said deputy foreign minister vladimir f 
petrovsky said 
but he added this american move is hardly aimed at improving 
mutual understanding between the usa and ussr 
dozens of uniformed and plainclothes policemen shouted at the 
demonstrators to disperse and ripped down some of the protesters 
posters during the 1hour protest within sight of the kremlin 
where reagan and gorbachev will meet starting sunday 
but unlike past protests the officers did not arrest or detain 
any of the demonstrators gathered outside the lenin library as 
western journalists watched 
one uniformed militiaman asked why the demonstrators were not 
hauled away responded in one word perestroika that is 
gorbachevs policy of restructuring soviet society including some 
greater tolerance of dissent and somewhat freer emigration 
a world without missiles or refuseniks proclaimed one large 
banner made of wallpaper we welcome the summit read another 
poster which plainclothes kgb officers ripped from the hands of 
30yearold marina durnovo 
roald alec zelichonok who has been refused permission to 
emigrate for more than 10 years said he received a letter and 
telephone call tuesday from the us embassy inviting him to take 
part in mondays meeting with reagan shortly after the embassy 
phone call he said a kgb officer telephoned 
this officer called and said in light of security measures 
around moscow my departure for moscow will not be permitted 
zelichonok said by telephone from his leningrad home 
zelichonok 51 said the officer warned him that if he traveled 
to moscow administrative measures carrying possible penalties 
of detention house arrest or up to 15 days in jail would be taken 
against him he said he thought the warning may have been prompted 
by his plan to present reagan a book he and another refusenik wrote 
about 18 wouldbe emigres who died awaiting permission to leave the 
country 
zelichonok said he intends to attend the meeting with his wife 
despite the warning 
soviet authorities have cleared the capital of undesirables 
during previous international events such as the 1980 summer 
olympics 
the demonstrators said they want human rights to figure 
prominently in the reagangorbachev meetings 
we very much hope that the summit brings success in the area 
of freedom of emigration said ms durnovo america is our 
hope our support the only country the opposes our country 
asked why she wanted to leave the soviet union and settle in the 
united states ms durnovo replied its impossible to live in 
this country i wont be alive by the time there are results of 
perestroika said ms durnovo a 30yearold moscow jew who 
applied to emigrate about six months ago she said she had not been 
denied permission to leave yet but that theres never a 
guarantee 
many of the protesters were from leningrad although 
demonstrators said about 15 of them who tried to travel to moscow 
were taken off a train bound for the capital by kgb officers other 
protesters came from the ukraine lithuania and moldavia 
the usbased national conference on soviet jewry reported last 
week that 1086 jews were allowed to leave the soviet union in 
april the highest monthly total in nearly seven years 
the figure has been rising for about a year but it falls far 
short of the 1979 levels when the monthly average was about 4000 
departures

the shoreham nuclear power plant long a 
burden to long island lighting co will be taken over by the state 
and torn down under an agreement reached thursday by state 
officials and the utility 
if the agreement which is subject to many conditions goes 
through it would be the first time a completed nuclear power plant 
was abandoned before it opened 
the deal calling for lilco to sell the 53 billion plant to the 
state for 1 was a victory for opponents of the facility 55 miles 
east of manhattan on the north shore of long island 
at a news conference thursday gov mario cuomo said the plant 
should be torn down rather than mothballed to prevent its 
resurrection 
that would be very much like taking a loaded rifle and storing 
it in the closet said cuomo maybe someday that nra national 
rifle association will take over and then we can use it 
us rep george hochbrueckner whose district includes the 
plant agreed weve shown shoreham the cross but we have to put 
a stake through its heart he said 
while cuomo said a few details remain to be worked out he 
insisted we have gotten everything we wanted 
shoreham has to die shoreham will die he said 
the shoreham project begun in 1965 ended up 10 years behind 
schedule and more than 80 times as expensive as originally 
predicted driving lilco to the edge of bankruptcy 
completed in 1984 it never went into service because of the 
refusal by state and local officials to participate in emergency 
evacuation planning they argued that long island because of its 
geography could not be safely evacuated during a nuclear accident 
the densely populated narrow island with about 25 million 
residents outside of new york city extends eastward about 120 
miles from manhattan in the event of an evacuation residents 
would have to leave either by boat or head westward 
without such a plan the nuclear regulatory commission refused 
to issue anything more than a lowpower testing license for 
shoreham 
state efforts to close shoreham accelerated after the nrc in 
october eliminated the rule requiring state and local government 
participation in an evacuation plan the state had been proceeding 
with a possible takeover of the company and cuomo had set a 
midnight wednesday deadline for the conclusion of negotiations 
the announcement of a tentative agreement between the state and 
lilco came about 1 hours after that deadline 
for lilco the settlement would allow it to continue to operate 
as a privately owned utility 
the entire agreement must be approved by the state public 
service commission and some parts of it need the legislatures 
approval new generating plants would then be built on long island 
to ensure an adequate supply of electricity 
the deal also is subject to lilco being able to obtain an 
investment rating that will allow it to refinance 2 billion of its 
debt at lower interest rates 
and any decommissioning plan would be subject to nrc approval 
said agency spokesman frank ingram while that could give the nrc 
the ability to block the dismantling cuomo spokesman gary fryer 
said he felt the nrc would consider only safety issues in ruling on 
plans to raze the plant 
under the tentative agreement lilco would pay for 
decommissioning which could cost 500 million said cuomo aides 
but the utility would be allowed to raise its electric rates by 5 
percent annually for the next three years and rate increases of 5 
percent annually would be the target for the following seven years 
lilcos nearly 1 million customers pay the secondhighest 
electric rates in the country second only to neighboring 
consolidated edison in the new york city area 
the governor said the agreement if finalized would have no 
negative impact on rates for customers of other utilities in the 
state 
the settlement calls for action by the public service commission 
on the rate structure issue within 90 days of the proposals filing 
with it expected in a few days during the 90day period lilco 
agreed not to turn up the power at shoreham even in the unlikely 
event that it obtained the 25 percent power operating license it 
had been seeking from the nrc 
cuomo has called lilcos management arrogant and cynical 
and insisted on company reforms but he said thursday that lilco 
and the state had yet to work out exactly what they would be he 
said it might be good if lilco chairman william catacosinos 
remained for the time being 
in addition to the tentative settlement with the state lilco is 
also trying to negotiate an end to a 87 billion racketeering case 
filed against the utility by suffolk county officials and 
individual homeowners

two flight instructors successfully 
ejected from a ta4j skyhawk navy training jet that crashed and 
burned thursday in a forest authorities said

safely to base said lt jg mary chamberlin spokeswoman for the 
meridian naval air station in mississippi 
they were identified as marine capt thomas henry renken and 
navy lt jg timothy john roorda who was being examined for a 
possible broken leg 
chamberlin said the jet based at meridian miss was on a 
routine training mission and crashed 1145 am in the scotch 
wildlife management area in southwest alabama 13 miles west of

authorities filed charges of passport violations 
thursday against a man they suspect is one of nine japanese red 
army terrorists who hijacked a japanese airliner to north korea in 
1970 when he was only 16 
hideo marutani of the district prosecutors office in kobe 
western japan said yasuhiro shibata 34 would be turned over to 
tokyo police in the next couple of days for investigation on 
possible hijacking and related charges 
investigators from kobe who arrested shibata in tokyo on may 6 
said he obtained the passport in yokohama in july 1986 using the 
name of a kobe man with dual japanese and north korean citizenship 
the man had returned to north korea in 1972 without disclaiming 
japanese citizenship they said 
marutani interviewed by telephone gave no further details he 
said shibata could be sentenced to three years in prison if 
convicted on the passport charges 
a convicted hijacker not charged with murder in japan is subject 
to a maximum term of life in prison the prosecutor said 
hijackers seized the japan air lines boeing 727 which had 138 
people aboard on a domestic flight they went first to south 
korea where they traded some passengers for a japanese vice 
minister of transportation then to pyongyang capital of communist 
north korea where the rest of the hostages were freed 
police said shibata returned to japan in april 1985 by an 
unknown route held parttime jobs and traveled several times to 
europe on the false passport 
shibata is the only one of the nine alleged hijackers arrested 
and police say he is the only one known to have returned to japan 
one of the others is said to have died in north korea recently of 
an undisclosed illness 
a spokesman for the national police said recently on condition 
of anonymity that he was certain north korean officials knew of 
shibatas return to japan he couldnt have left north korea 
without the permission of the north korean government the 
spokesman said 
north koreas official korean central news agency called 
japanese allegations of north korean complicity groundless 
slanders and said of the hijackers we did not mind where they 
went regarding it as their right proceeding from their free will 
japanese officials said police had questioned shibata about his 
activities in europe but said it still was too early to say whether 
europe was being used as a red army base 
osamu maruoka the red armys reputed no 2 man and yu 
kikumura an alleged red army member arrested in the united states 
in april for possessing explosives are believed to have traveled 
in europe before their arrests 
maruoka was arrested in japan in november 
two more red army suspects junzo okudaira and fusako shigenobu 
are being sought by police in italy for suspected involvement in a 
car bomb attack at a us military club in naples also in april 
the arrests and bombing have caused speculation that the 
longdormant terrorist group is planning a comeback possibly on 
the occasion of the toronto summit of seven industrialized 
countries june 1921 or the 1988 olympics in seoul south korea 
beginning in september 
the red army was formed in 1968 and had no more than 300 members 
at its peak police say following police crackdowns in the late 
1960s about 30 members slipped out of japan to operate abroad

a conservative georgia congressman supported 
by 71 house republican colleagues asked the house ethics committee 
thursday to investigate allegations that speaker jim wright has 
violated house ethics rules 
the request from rep newt gingrich a leader of the republican 
right in the house came one week after a similar call from the 
government watchdog group common cause for an ethics committee 
investigation of wright 
under house rules gingrichs complaint will require the panel 
formally known as the committee on standards of official conduct 
to vote on whether to investigate wright dtexas the committee is 
made up of six democrats and six republicans 
rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the committee declined 
comment on gingrichs complaint but wright told reporters he hoped 
the committee will resolve the issue quickly 
i feel certain i have not violated house rules wright said 
i most certainly have never intended to do so 
as for gingrich who has been calling publicly for such an 
investigation since december wright said my views toward him 
are similar to those of a fire hydrant toward dogs 
gingrichs complaint asked the ethics committee to investigate 
published allegations about wright in four areas two of which 
involved his book reflections of a public man 
the complaint cited reports that wright received unusually high 
royalties of 55 percent on the book which was published by a 
printing company that received nearly 300000 worth of business 
from wrights campaign committee in 198586 
the complaint asked the committee to determine if the royalty 
arrangement violated house rules and if wrights relationship with 
the company was used by the speaker as a way to convert campaign 
funds to personal use 
the complaint also asked for an investigation into published 
reports of wrights 1979 intervention with egyptian president anwar 
sadat in behalf of a businessman who earlier had allowed wright to 
invest in a proven oil well and his 1979 intervention with the 
department of interior to influence a gas lease decision involving 
a company in which wright owned 15000 worth of stock 
he said the incidents provide direct examples of the use of 
public office for personal enrichment 
common cause cited wrights book and his financial dealings with 
its publisher in its call for an investigation last week but not 
the two 1979 incidents 
the selfstyled citizens lobby also asked for an investigation 
into allegations that wright violated federal ethics rules while 
seeking special treatment from the federal home loan bank board for 
texas constituents and democratic contributors 
the 71 house republicans who signed a letter to the ethics 
committee supporting gingrichs complaint included the entire house 
gop leadership except rep robert h michel of illinos 
as gingrich was announcing his complaint against wright the 
democratic congressional campaign committee issued a statement 
charging that gingrich received 13000 from wealthy friends in 
1977 to write a novel he never produced 
rep beryl anthony jr dark chairman of the dccc said the 
objective of the partnership arrangment that provided the 13000 
to gingrich apparently was to allow gingrich a means for 
financial gain not available to the average american 
gingrich said in response that he was paid the 13000 for a 
summers work researching the novel but an agent who reviewed the 
initial chapters told him he was far better at shaking hands than 
writing fiction 
gingrich noted he was not a member of congress in 1977 and 
said no one was trying to gain influence over an assistant 
college professor

an intense propane fire ran out of gas 
thursday ending a twoday ordeal that forced 500 families from 
their homes and shut down a commuter railroad line to new york city 
the fire in a 2500gallon tanker overturned on the 
seafordoyster bay expressway burned itself out at 630 am 
the tank was empty inspector nelson finkelman of the county 
fire marshals office it literally ran out of gas 
it was the equivalent of a small bomb nassau county 
executive thomas gulotta said if this tank had exploded it would 
have devastated everything within a 1000foot radius 
finkelman said the fire burned out sooner than expected 
probably because the tanker was not full when it overturned 
tuesday it also burned faster after firefighters opened a vent on 
the tanker wednesday to increase consumption of the liquid 
within three hours after the fire was out long island rail road 
began operating trains again on the babylon line the truck 
overturned just 2000 feet south of the lirr track the sunrise 
highway and the seafordoyster bay expressway also were reopened 
lirr said 30000 rail commuters were affected and 70000 
motorists were forced to find alternate routes about 500 families 
were urged to evacuate and many slept in cots in school gymnasiums 
the accident occurred when defective springs in the truck broke 
shifting the trucks weight which in turn caused the drive shaft 
to separate and the rear portion to dig into the ground 
the broken shaft acted as a catapult overturning the truck 
said ken cynar a spokesman for gulotta 
the driver and a passenger escaped with minor cuts and bruises 
the driver was charged with driving with a suspended license 
gulotta said the county may sue conservative gas of wyandanch 
which owned the tanker and serves 40000 residential and commercial 
customers 
nassau county comptroller peter king said the emergency cost the 
county more than 300000 in overtime salaries and equipment

rival afghan guerrilla groups will race to seize 
kabul from the communist government when soviet troops are gone 
and the result could be chaos the international institute for 
strategic studies said thursday 
it also predicted in its annual survey that the ussoviet 
summit starting sunday in moscow will produce a reasonable chance 
of agreement before president reagan leaves office on cutting 
stocks of longrange nuclear weapons in half 
i dont expect a deal to be cut at the moscow summit but i 
think we can forsee progress hans binnendijk told a news 
conference wednesday before the strategic survey 198788 was 
released he is director of studies for the londonbased research 
group 
there is a reasonable prospect that this can be settled before 
the end of the reagan administration in january he said 
the survey said the kremlin may try to retain influence in 
afghanistan by exploiting ethnic rivalries and would prefer 
lebanonstyle chaos to the total collapse of the government it 
leaves behind the soviets have agreed to withdraw their estimated 
soldiers within nine months 
if and when the soviet union withdraws from afghanistan 
there will be a race to kabul by guerrilla groups according to 
the 240page report 
it said the sevenparty alliance of moslem guerrillas probably 
will collapse and the remnants of president najibs administration 
could seek out local alliances with parts of the warring 
factions 
there could be a power vacuum in kabul and isolated fronts 
fighting each other on the basis of ethnic and political rivalries 
allowing the soviet union to retain a foothold the survey said 
chaos and the lebanonization are better outcomes for moscow 
than signing the death warrant of najibs regime 
a tribally fragmented afghanistan would suit pakistan as a 
buffer zone with the soviet union and also iran which wants to 
retain supremacy with the shiite moslem minorities the study 
found pakistan and iran are afghanistans neighbors on the east 
and west 
binnendijks organization sees the possibility of the red army 
retaining bases in northern afghanistan and direct influence over 
the area 
were this to turn out to be the eventual solution it would 
at best produce a stabilization of the warring kingdoms under a 
weak central government at worst it would result in complete 
chaos leading sooner or later to yet another afghan crisis the 
report said 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and the soviet union sent military forces to afghanistan in 
december 1979 the soviet withdrawal began may 15 and half its 
soldiers are to be out by aug 15 
the international institute for strategic studies is an 
international nongovernmental center for research on security and 
arms control funded largely by private foundations its members and 
staff come from 70 countries 
on eastwest relations the survey said the superpower agreement 
to eliminate mediumrange nuclear missiles and other developments 
during 1987 created the sense that significant and perhaps 
fundamental changes were under way was almost palpable 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms coincided with 
reagans vision of a nonnuclear world and his apparent wish 
to leave his stamp on history the report said 
it was the confluence of both superpowers views that each 
could gain from a change in their security relationship and their 
respective adjustments to economic difficulties that produced the 
sense that 1987 might be a watershed year the researchers 
concluded 
they reached these conclusions in two other areas 
middle east there is a shift of focus among key arab 
governments to the view that the iraniraq war nearly eight 
years old is a greater threat to their security than israel 
latin america drug dealers emerged as a preeminent national 
security concern in colombia and in panama narcotics traffickers 
led by gen manuel antonio noriega have become the government 
in its ability to subvert societies and seize control of 
governments narcoterrorism may already be on a par with 
communism as a threat to western interests in latin america

blood tests on air force veterans who were 
assigned to spray defoliants like agent orange in vietnam show 
unusually heavy levels of exposure to dioxin the us centers 
for disease control said thurdsay 
the cdc reported results of blood testing among 147 air force 
men who served in the operation ranch hand defoliation 
activities but the report drew no conclusion about how if at all 
the mens dioxin exposure might affect their health 
at least 1200 men participated in operation ranch hand the 
code name for the continuing aerial spraying conducted by the air 
force during the vietnam war 
the high levels exposure to the toxic chemical among the ranch 
hand personnel didnt necessarily come as a surprise said dr 
larry l needham a cdc researcher 
sixtytwo percent or 91 of the 147 ranch hand veterans who 
were tested showed blooddioxin levels of more than 20 parts per 
trillion commonly regarded as the upper threshold for dioxin 
exposure in the general population cdc researchers said 
the average blooddioxin level among the men was 49 parts per 
trillion three ranch hand airmen had exposure levels over 200 
parts per trillion and two had levels over 300 parts per trillion 
the cdc said 
in a control group of 49 veterans tested for comparison 
purposes only one man had a blooddioxin level over 20 parts per 
trillion and he had been exposed to industrial chemicals since 
1980 at an indiana steel foundry the cdc said 
the blood tests indicate that some ranch hand personnel had 
unusually heavy tcdd dioxin exposure the atlantabased agency 
said however the agency noted no threshold level has been 
determined as yet for the health effects of tcdd in humans 
earlier the cdc reported on blooddioxin levels among army 
ground troops potentially exposed to agent orange needham noted 
the one big difference we are seeing he said is the 
army ground troops did not seem to have elevated exposures 
only two out of 646 such soldiers had blooddioxin levels over 
20 parts per trillion needham said 
dioxin is a toxic chemical to which virtually all people have 
been exposed somewhat through the environment however dioxin 
contamination of agent orange and other herbicides used to clear 
the jungles in vietnam war operations has prompted concern about 
the health of military personnel exposed to such agents 
a study released in march showed no unusual health problems to 
date among more than 1000 vietnam veterans who were involved in 
the spraying of agent orange 
that study drew criticism because it used estimated exposure 
levels 
new techniques make it possible for scientists to detect dioxin 
levels in human blood even years after exposure the test results 
announced thursday part of a 198788 air force investigation are 
from the first appreciable number of those tests performed on 
ranch hand personnel needham said 
a report on the 198788 air force health study will be published 
after blooddioxin tests have been completed on all participants 
and the report passes executive branch review the cdc said

a decomposed body found thursday in a 
morticians bag may be that of reputed mobster john digilio who 
disappeared three weeks ago state and federal officials said 
theres every reason to believe it is john digilio said 
col clinton l pagano superintendent of state police 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said credit cards with 
digilios name on them were found on the body if the body is not 
too decomposed fingerprints could be taken for identification he 
said 
we want to get the dental records said bayonne police capt 
tom lavin thats how badly decomposed it was 
authorities identify digilio a 55yearold former boxer as a 
soldier in the genovese organized crime family after his 
disappearance was reported may 7 law enforcement officials 
speculated he was killed in an organized crime dispute 
digilio was a colorful figure acting as his own attorney in a 
federal waterfront racketeering trial that ended with his acquittal 
last month often inviting boxing celebrities to court and filing a 
harassment suit against federal officials 
that flamboyance authorities say may have led to his death 
intelligence indicated that other genovese family members were 
dissatisfied with digilios high profile and that reputed family 
boss vincent chin gigante sanctioned the hit officials said 
digilio was to be sentenced on a state loansharking charge may 
19 and authorities had also speculated his disappearance was a 
ploy connected with sentencing he has won frequent delays in 
trials through claims of mental problems 
but at the sentencing hearing digilios lawyer said the only 
likely reason for his clients absence was foul play at the court 
proceeding the judge issued a warrant for digilios arrest

constitutional grounds probably exist to 
appeal the sentence of an 18yearold woman convicted of child 
abuse and ordered to practice birth control for the remainder of 
her childbearing years her defense attorney said thursday 
also thursday debra ann forsters mother said she understood 
the judges decision to an extent but hoped the birthcontrol 
requirement could be dropped eventually 
robert billar a maricopa county deputy public defender said he 
will recommend that his office appeal the ms forsters sentence 
including obviously the provisions for mandatory birth control 
possible grounds include constitutional rights to privacy 
religion and so forth he said ms forster is roman catholic 
the church opposes artificial birth control 
on tuesday a maricopa county superior court judge sentenced ms 
forster to lifetime probation with the provisions that she remain 
on birth control during her childbearing years and not see any of 
her three children one of whom was born in jail 
she had pleaded guilty in april to two counts of felony child 
abuse for leaving her two young sons alone in an apartment during a 
hotweather spell without food or water for three days last may 
she could have received 30 years in prison 
ms forsters two boys 18monthold william and 6monthold 
scott were hospitalized eight days for malnutrition lesions 
caused by a rash and dehydration scott was close to death from 
dehydration when he was found by ms forsters estranged husband 
police said 
ms forster told judge lindsay ellis budzyn she left the 
children because she could not cope with the pressures of taking 
care of them alone 
budzyn said wednesday the birthcontrol requirement was the only 
way she could make sure the woman would not abuse other children 
society offers little or no support to help those who are under 
stress so that they do not abuse their children the judge said 
we dont have a lot of help out there for people she said 
budzyn indicated that ms forsters probation terms like those 
of all cases could be modified in the future if requested by ms 
forster or her probation officer 
mary jane golotte ms forsters mother said thursday from 
amelia la she understood the sentence to an extent and that 
the birthcontrol requirement is reasonable for the next several 
years while the daughter gets life back together 
however ms golotte also said she hoped the requirement could 
be dropped eventually 
later down the road people do change and what if she 
decides to get married and start her life all over again what is 
there for her to look forward to the mother asked 
ms golotte also said she disagreed with budzyns statement that 
ms forsters case was an example of children having children 
i think a lot of it has to do with drugs she said i 
dont think it was because debra ann was not mature enough to have 
children 
ms golotte 33 said that she was 15 when her daughter was born 
and that her own mother gave birth to her also at age 15 
a catholic church official joined civil liberties advocates in 
criticizing the sentence 
the rev timothy davern phoenix diocese vice chancellor said 
that he objected to the sentence on the grounds of religious 
liberty and what he called its contradictory message 
ms forster has been sentenced to a lifetime of probation 
counseling he said but the judge seems to be saying that no 
amount of counseling could help this person grow to be a whole 
person 
im not trying to minimize what she did but how much does the 
average person change between the ages of 20 and 30 davern said 
ms forster gave birth to a daughter while in jail awaiting 
trial on the child abuse charges according to court records a 
family friend adopted the daughter and the sons were being placed 
through an adoption agency

the soviet parliament approved legislation 
thursday making it easier for private cooperatives to compete with 
staterun businesses and giving local authorities power to promote 
certain goods and services with tax breaks 
the supreme soviet the countrys nominal parliament made some 
rare amendments to the law and held back the tax structure for 
further changes the moves came in a threeday session that ended 
thursday after much debate 
the supreme soviet normally only approves laws put forward by 
the ruling communist party debate over the cooperative law which 
delayed the vote for a day underscored a greater willingness and 
ability to speak out under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
policy of greater openness 
officials said that in three months of public debate about the 
law before it reached the supreme soviet 42 of its 50 articles had 
been amended 
the amended law which passed unanimously thursday as is 
traditional goes into effect july 1 
local soviets governing councils and other state bodies can 
set a preferential tax system on cooperatives and members 
said alexei ponomarev the head of a supreme soviet commission that 
reported on the cooperative law to the parliament thursday 
the law as initially presented had given only national 
officials the right to give tax breaks 
the adopted law also guarantees that cooperatives cannot be run 
out of business by staterun enterprises it allows them to conduct 
business with foreign companies and receive hard currency as 
payment to own buildings and other property and to appeal 
decisions by authorities not to license a cooperative 
cooperatives are owned by the people who work in them and 
represent a small sector of the soviet economy which is dominated 
by staterun ventures 
the arrangement is permissible under marxist theory which 
teaches that workers are exploited if they work for anyone other 
than the state or themselves 
a law permitting formation of cooperatives has been adopted 
under gorbachev soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov said tuesday 
that 14000 cooperatives were formed in the first 18 months of the 
law and another 6000 in the past three months 
gorbachev has said he is depending on their development to 
provide consumer goods and services that the inefficient staterun 
economy cannot provide 
restaurants are one of the most popular forms of cooperatives 
that have opened others have formed to make clothing pump gas 
make home repairs and provide other services 
in debate wednesday in the soviet of nationalities one of the 
two chambers of parliament deputy georgy tarazevich of minsk 
byelorussia said local authorities should be given the right to 
give tax breaks to encourage production of goods and services they 
think are necessary 
in my view its necessary to transfer to local soviets the 
tax policy regarding cooperatives he said in remarks reprinted 
by the government newspaper izvestia 
ponomarev said the overall tax structure also would be reworked 
allowing flexibility depending on market conditions as well as 
the activity of cooperatives 
but he did not say whether the specific tax rates in the law 
would be reconsidered 
under the law as presented on tuesday personal income taxes 
would be 27 percent on a monthly income of 1600 and 535 percent 
on an income of 3200 the tax rate eventually reaches 90 percent 
the average industrial worker in the soviet union makes about 
320 a month 
officials have said the aim of the progressive tax system is to 
encourage the cooperatives to invest in expanding business rather 
than paying high salaries to workers

the nations mayors complained to a house 
panel on thursday that local governments face continued delays in 
receiving federal monies for antidrug programs 
kansas city mo mayor richard berkley speaking on behalf of 
the us conference of mayors blamed the delays on administrative 
problems of state governments as well as the federal government 
frankly we are frustrated with the bureaucracy and we are 
disheartened by the lack of support from the federal government 
berkley said in prepared testimony the drug problem is in the 
streets the schools the playgrounds of our cities the 
handtohand combat is in the cities 
berkley president of the mayors group asked the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse to change the law so federal aid could 
be sent directly to cities state agencies now distribute most of 
the money after receiving it from the federal government 
state and local governments are to receive about 456 million 
for drug programs in the current budget year of which 70 million 
is for enforcement 230 million for education and 156 million for 
treatment according to the mayors 
a justice department official acknowledged to the committee that 
there had been some delay by states in preparing and submitting 
applications for antidrug monies in 1987 but he maintained all 
of those are understandable because of the time required to 
collect needed data and prepare spending plans 
there is no delay on the part of the federal government 
said richard abell assistant attorney general in the dpartments 
office of justice programs 
he said the justice department took an average of 37 days to 
release monies to a state after it submitted its drug program plan 
berkleys remarks reiterated criticisms made last year by the 
mayors that federal and state government were not quickly 
distributing monies to cities for programs established after a 
highly publicized 1986 antidrug crusade by congress and the reagan 
administration 
berkley also objected to the administrations proposed 
elimination of federal aid for drug law enforcement in fiscal year 
1989 which starts oct 1 
this is not the way to wage a war on anything berkley said 
berkley welcomed reagans proposed 1989 increases of 10 million 
for treatment and 20 million for drug education

a 78yearold retired farmer will serve 
at least 28 months in prison for the shooting death of his wife 
who suffered from alzheimers disease a judge ruled thursday 
oscar carlson who has said he shot his 71yearold wife agnes 
in february to end her suffering from the disease will begin 
serving his time at the stillwater state prison immediately 
douglas county district court judge paul ballard gave carlson a 
43month sentence with good behavior carlson would be eligible 
for parole in 28 months 
ballard recommended that carlson later be placed in one of the 
states least restrictive facilities that decision would be made 
by the state commissioner of corrections 
with good behavior carlson would be eligible for parole in 28 
months 
before the sentencing carlson told ballard that he was so 
sorry for what happened to his wife of 45 years 
speaking in a faltering voice and sometimes breaking into tears 
carlson asked ballard to place him in a nursing home instead of 
sending him to prison 
i hope you will put me in a home someplace where i can be of 
some good to somebody carlson said 
carlsons attorneys had hoped that carlson who they said had 
never even received a traffic ticket would not have to serve time 
in prison 
carlson pleaded guilty several weeks ago to seconddegree murder 
after ballard said he would consider a maximum 43month sentence 
that agreement departs from state sentencing guidelines which call 
for an 18year sentence for seconddegree murder 
carlson said in court thursday during a presentence hearing 
that he snapped when he received the news feb 28 that his wife had 
broken her hip and would have to be hospitalized the next day he 
took an old pistol to the crestview manor nursing home in 
evansville where she lived and shot her four times 
i just cracked up i just couldnt take no more carlson 
said 
douglas county attorney ann carrott had opposed the 43month 
sentence she said that she feels compassion toward carlson but 
believes sentencing guidelines should be followed 
she also presented a witness wednesday who suggested that 
carlson had abused his wife and another who said he had complained 
about the high cost of his wifes care prior to her death however 
the nursing director of the home testified under crossexamination 
that an investigation had shown no abuse of mrs carlson 
carlson testified last month that his wife asked to be shot 
carlson said he shot her four times with a 22caliber pistol and 
then sat down to pray and watch her die 
all three of carlsons daughters testified last month that they 
hoped their father would be shown leniency because of the strain he 
was under and his age

out of the persian gulf shipping executives said no casualties 
were reported 
iraq said its antiaircraft gunners shot down an iranian f5 
fighter over the battlefield in the salamcheh sector near iraqs 
southern port of basra 
iran said it sent thousands of volunteers thursday to the 
battlefront after their positions east of basra fell in a lightning 
assault wednesday 
iranians hit the 15530ton liquefied petroleum gas carrier 
mundogas rio at 745 pm as it sailed out of the strait of hormuz 
and tried to jam its radio communications said the shipping 
executives speaking on condition of anonymity 
but the signal for help by the liberianflagged tanker which 
carried a shipment of saudi arabian oil products was picked up by 
another unidentified commercial ship in the vicinity the 
executives said 
it was the third attack by the iranians on neutral shipping 
since washington broadened the duties of the us navy in the gulf 
allowing warships to interevene in attacks on commercial vessels 
even if they are not sailing under the stars and stripes 
the executives said they were not aware of any us navy 
warships in the area at the time of the attack

fire aboard the ship but no casualties among the crew 
the fire was quickly extinguished and the vessel sailed at full 
speed toward the omani port of fujairah outside the strait of 
hormuz said the sources

fishers threatened thursday to end a 
weeklong truce in the great anglers strike after they spotted 
government inspectors checking for fishing licenses 
fishers and boatmen said they would renew a boycott of irish 
lakes and rivers friday to protest the new law requiring anglers to 
buy licenses for the first time 
after the law was announced in april angling clubs declared 
their waters offlimits to fishing hotels told guests to stay 
away and fishing stores refused to sell licenses 
the roman catholic archbishop of tuam joseph cassidy announced 
he had negotiated a deal with the government that prevented the law 
from being implemented until further talks 
fishers said the appearance of the two inspectors in western 
ireland betrayed the terms of the deal 
michael ryan secretary of the federation of boatmen which 
represents lake fishing boats said the boycott would resume friday 
the only talking we will do is through archbishop cassidy 
directly to the government ryan said 
the licenses cost from 1560 to 2650 depending on the type 
of fish sought 
charles sinnott chairman of irelands western regional tourism 
organization said more protests could harm western irelands 60 
million dollar tourism industry

the us auto and textile industries would be 
losers in barrierfree trade between the united states and canada 
while industrial machinery electronics and energyintensive 
businesses would be winners a private study concluded thursday 
the study by the northeastmidwest institute issued as 
congressional committees considered whether to recommend approval 
of a freetrade treaty between the two countries said the 
agreement broke new ground in easing trade barriers but failed to 
eliminate some longstanding trade problems 
if approved the agreement probably will increase bilateral 
trade particularly between canada and the northeastmidwest 
region the study said however the impact of the proposed 
agreement likely would be uneven with some industries gaining and 
others losing 
while the agreement would provide freer trade its overall 
impact on the balance of trade remains uncertain said the 
institute which is a nonpartisan research group established at the 
behest of members of congress to serve senators and representatives 
of 18 northeastern and midwestern states 
the us automotive industry would suffer because the agreement 
would retain through 1996 canadian programs giving breaks on duties 
to thirdcountry manufacturers 
that provision would enable canadian parts suppliers to build 
longterm ties with foreignowned auto manufacturers and the 
programs distortive trade and investment effects would remain in 
effect long after these duty remissions schemes were terminated 
the study said 
the treatys requirement that at least half the content of any 
auto crossing the border dutyfree be north american is not 
stringent enough to prevent the purchase of engines drive trains 
and vehicle electronics from third countries the study said 
the proposed 10year phaseout of canadas 92 percent tariff on 
automotive goods would discriminate against us makers while 
giving their canadian counterparts dutyfree access to us 
markets the study said 
canadian tariffs on textiles which range from 175 percent to 
255 percent would remain higher than us duties throughout a 
10year phaseout period maintaining a more restrictive barrier 
for us producers selling in the canadian market the study said 
the agreement would give canadian textile makers a 56 million 
yard quota for dutyfree treatment of apparel made from imported 
fabric double last years shipments to the united states while 
us manufacturers could ship only 115 million yards the amount 
of last years exports to canada the study said 
that lower level for the united states would limit 
opportunities for us producers to penetrate the canadian 
market the study said 
the freetrade agreement by eliminating over five years tariffs 
on most industrial machinery produced for shipment to canada would 
allow exports of such products to become a leading growth sector in 
the region the report said 
canada is the largest market for us electronics exports 
immediate removal of tariffs on data processing equipment and 
telephone sets and gradual elimination of tariffs on 
telecommunications equipment would increase us electronics 
exports further the study said 
chemical processors fertilizer manufacturers food processors 
metal casting plants and pulp paper and lumber mills would gain 
greater reliability in their supply of lowcost canadian 
hydroelectric power and natural gas through provisions of the 
agreement preventing new quotas taxes or price requirements the 
study said

vietnam announced thursday it will 
withdraw 50000 soldiers from cambodia beginning next month and 
will complete the pullout from its southeast asian neighbor in 1990 
the development came in advance of sundays start of the moscow 
summit at which president reagan said he would ask soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev to encourage the vietnamese to resolve the 
cambodian conflict 
from hanoi kyodo news service quoted vietnams defense and 
foreign affairs ministries as saying the pullout would cut the 
number of troops in half or to about 50000 
according to american estimates the move would leave 70000 to 
75000 of hanois forces battling guerrillas in cambodia 
the withdrawal by land and sea routes is to take place between 
june and december 
communiques from the defense ministries of vietnam and cambodia 
said the two governments had agreed the remaining vietnamese troops 
would be placed under the command of the phnom penh government 
the announcements monitored in bangkok were carried by radio 
hanoi and the official cambodian news agency spk 
the sovietarmed vietnamese invaded cambodia in late 1978 
overthrowing the regime of the khmer rouge and setting up a 
prohanoi government in phnom penh they are fighting guerrillas 
backed by china noncommunist southeast asian countries and the 
united states 
the 50000 or more guerrillas including the khmer rouge are 
grouped in a coalition led by prince norodom sihanouk the former 
head of state 
in moscow deputy foreign minister igor a rogachev said 
vietnams planned withdrawal could improve relations between the 
soviet union and china and indicates a political decision can be 
reached in the conflict 
we think this opens a direct avenue for the speedy solution to 
the problems around kampuchea cambodia and for turning it into a 
zone of peace rogachev said at a press conference 
he noted the withdrawal will eliminate two of the three issues 
considered obstacles by the chinese in normalizing relations 
between the soviet union and china 
the chinese have said relations will improve only when the 
soviets withdraw from afghanistan a process begun may 15 the 
vietnamese end their occupation of cambodia and the soviets agree 
to reduce troops along the sinosoviet border 
the cambodian news agency said that over the past nine years 
the phnom penh government has gradually undertaken the defense 
work by itself thus creating the conditions for six annual 
withdrawals of vietnamese volunteer troops from kampuchea 
cambodia 
this time the command of the vietnamese volunteer army in 
kampuchea will also be pulled out and the remaining vietnamese 
troops in kampuchea are to be placed under the command of the 
peoples republic of kampuchea until their complete withdrawal in 
1990 
in tokyo the official radio hanoi monitored by radio press 
quoted vietnams foreign ministry as announcing that outsiders 
would be allowed to watch the pullout 
this years partial withdrawal would be by far the largest of 
the six that vietnam claims to have made since 1982 the united 
states says the only genuine withdrawal occurred last november 
when 20000 troops went home 
although pledging to completely withdraw by 1990 vietnam has 
warned it will take action if khmer rouge guerrillas try to retake 
power 
in bangkok a spokesman for sihanouk roland eng said he 
welcomed the announced withdrawal but said vietnam should accept 
sihanouks proposal for an international peacekeeping force to 
verify the pullout and to prevent the vietnamese and the khmer 
rouge from returning 
a senior western embassy official said vietnam was able to 
withdraw forces last november because of the low level of military 
activity in cambodia in the past year 
the strategy of the khmer rouge the most powerful of the 
guerrilla groups has been to gain control of the villages and 
avoid direct clashes with the vietnamese apparently to preserve 
its forces for the 1990 withdrawal he said 
he said the vietnamese were moving into the interior leaving 
the phnom penh forces to guard the thai border area the 
traditional zone of fighting

kevin tucker an exsecret service agent who 
once guarded president kennedys family quit thursday as head of 
the police department after a 2year tenure that restored morale 
to a force laced with corruption and reeling from the move 
catastrophe 
it was a high honor and privilege to serve this city 
tucker 47 said at a news conference his resignation takes effect 
june 10 
mayor w wilson goode praised tucker for bringing integrity 
and pride to a department in crisis 
tucker said he wants to spend more time with his wife and 
children living in nearby medford lakes nj he has been living in 
philadelphia as is required under home rule charter 
i dont want to go into the specifics of my personal reasons 
but i have a lease that is expiring and i have been wanting to 
spend more time with my kids tucker said one of my 
disappointments was being away from my family 
tucker indicated that he will take a little time before taking 
on an undisclosed job in philadelphias private sector 
i leave with a very good feeling for this city and i look 
forward to being part of this city as a citizen he said before 
the news conference 
tucker took over a moraleshattered department reeling from 
extortion convictions of 34 people including a deputy 
commissioner in january 1986 seven months earlier was the 
confrontation with the radical group move in which police dropped 
a bomb that killed 11 people and destroyed 61 houses 
the police commissioners job was vacated by gregore sambor who 
was in charge during the move siege and the federal investigations 
that led to extortion charges against members of the force 
when tucker took over he was the first outsider to head the 
6700member force in more than 60 years he told goode then he 
didnt plan to make it a lifetime career and only wanted to instill 
pride in the police force in the nations fifthlargest city 
during his tenure he even earned the respect of the fraternal 
order of police who often opposed his cleanthehouse methods that 
included shakeups of personnel drug examinations and lie detector 
tests 
fop president robert hurst blamed the city council and mayor for 
tuckers resignation alleging that failure to provide money to 
hire more officers and pay for needed reforms had soured him 
theyve devastated and ruined the department and as a result 
the only shining star in the goode administration is walking out on 
them he is a visionary it is demoralizing to lose him hurst 
said 
tucker who was a police officer in rahway nj before joining 
the secret service in 1965 spent four years traveling around the 
world providing security for john f kennedys widow jacqueline 
and their two children he was agent in charge of the philadelphia 
office before resigning in may 1985 for a job in private business 
goode said he would appoint a successor from within the 
department hopefully by the time tucker leaves 
among the leading candidates were two deputy commissioners 
robert armstrong and willie williams who were with tucker when he 
announced his resignation 
armstrong the departments no 2 man declined to be drawn into 
a discussion of a successor except to say the choice is going to 
be competitive and i am proud to be part of the process 
all williams would say was there is a cadre of good men in the 
department who are capable of taking over the job 
if appointed williams 44 a member of the force since 1964 who 
was made a deputy commissioner by tucker would be philadelphias 
first black police commissioner 
the decision will be made by the mayor and i think he has a 
very difficult decision because of the good talent of people within 
this organization tucker said 
gerald caplan who headed a task force that studied the 
department for a year said tucker got worn down trying to 
improve the department 
none of it came easy caplan said he not only had to 
educate the department but develop a constituency within the city 
government something that cost him an enormous emount of energy

scholars a board spokesman announced thursday 
the spokesman george eager said the agreement was signed 
monday in new york by stanley katz head of the american council of 
learned societies which oversees irex and namsrain sodnom

inaccessible to american specialists except for brief visits to 
congresses on mongol culture and history

mongolists and specialists on inner asia to settle in for semester 
or yearlong stays in order to tap the unexplored riches of 
mongolian archive and manuscript collections he said 
the agreement will provide for the exchange of up to 10 scholars

the value of us agricultural exports is 
expected to reach a fouryear high of 335 billion this fiscal 
year up from 279 billion in 198687 the agriculture department 
said thursday 
actual quantities of shipments were forecast at 1455 million 
metric tons up from 1292 million tons last year 
export values dropped to a decade low of 263 billion two years 
ago but improved slightly to 279 billion in 198687 the tonnage 
of shipments dropped to 1095 million tons in 198586 before 
recovering in 198687 
despite this years gains the current estimates are still far 
below the record of 438 billion and 1623 million tons 
established in 198081 before world economic conditions high 
interest rates foreign competition a rising value of the us 
dollar and other factors triggered the slide 
the new forecast also was up by 1 billion and 3 million tons 
from usdas previous estimate on feb 25 
officials attributed the boost to a growth in animal and 
horticultural products and soybeans the boost in tonnage 
reflects improved prospects for wheat feed ingredients and 
soybeans the report said 
the value of animal products was boosted 600 million from the 
february forecast to a record of 56 billion this year due to 
strongerthanexpected demand for hides red meats and animal 
fats the report said 
most of the increase in volume stems from larger grain exports 
as the export enhancement program eep and tighter competitor 
supplies boost the us share of world markets the report said 
also higher prices are expected for grains oilseeds and 
cotton 
under the eep arrangement selected countries including the 
soviet union and china have been getting wheat and other 
designated commodities at prices subsidized by the us government 
imports of agricultural products this fiscal year were forecast 
at a record 21 billion up 500 million from the february 
estimate last years imports dropped slightly to 206 billion 
from 209 billion in 198586 the previous high mark 
but as a result of export values climbing more rapidly the us 
agricultural trade balance the difference between exports and 
imports is expected to rise sharply to 125 billion from 73 
billion last year 
however the 198788 balance would still be far less than the 
191 billion edge us farm exports had over imports in 198384

a decision by the agriculture department to 
loosen up acreage controls on 1989 wheat production indicates the 
united states intends to be a grain seller not a grain storer 
the head of the national association of wheat growers said thursday 
frank johannsen a wheat farmer from bayard neb referred to a 
usda announcement on wednesday that producers would be required to 
idle no more than 10 percent of their wheat base acreage to qualify 
for 1989 program benefits the acreage setaside was 275 percent 
for 1988 
johannsen said the smaller landidling requirement requires a 
continuing federal commitment to operate the export enchancement 
program or eep which has helped reduce surplus us wheat 
stockpiles 
under eep selected foreign countries including the soviet 
union and china have been able to buy huge quantities of wheat at 
subsidized prices 
we intend to work closely with usda and the congress to see 
that existing export assistance programs are used effectively and 
that the past oversupply of wheat not be allowed to reoccur he 
said in statement released by the associations washington office 
for 50 years and often to its detriment the united states 
has held virtually all the worlds surplus grain johannsen 
added with the 1989 wheat program we shift that burden to our 
competitors

a bipartisan group of 23 senators asked the 
reagan administration thursday to drop efforts to restrict 
counseling services at family planning clinics in light of three 
court injunctions against the policy 
we urge you to abandon efforts to implement these 
unconstitutional regulations sen john chafee rri and 22 
colleagues said in the letter to health and human services 
secretary otis r bowen 
the administration has said its regulations were designed to 
strengthen the wall between federally funded family planning 
services primarily aimed at lowincome women and abortion 
services which the government does not subsidize 
among other things doctors and counselors at clinics receiving 
federal grants would not be able to tell a pregnant woman that 
abortion was one of her options 
federal judges in massachusetts new york and the district of 
columbia issued injunctions against the regulations 
the senators said recent statements indicate the administration 
plans to determine which family planning grant recipients are not 
affected by the injunctions and proceed with implementation and 
enforcement for these few and unfortunate programs 
the nine republicans and 14 democrats said they were troubled by 
a policy that continues to press illegal unconstitutional and 
medically unethical rules onto providers of such an important 
service 
th net result of pursuing the policy will be costly litigation 
and reduced services for the poor they said 
we respectfully urge you to put an end to this dispute and 
formally withdraw the regulations in question the senators said

an aids testing and counseling bill in the 
works for more than a year cleared its first congressional panel 
thursday stripped of a controversial provision outlawing 
discrimination against victims of the fatal disease 
the bill approved on a voice vote by the house energy and 
commerce health subcommittee authorizes 400 million next year and 
each of the following two years for new and expanded testing 
programs run by states localities and private groups 
testing would have to be voluntary and accompanied by 
counseling anonymous testing and use of pseudonyms would have to 
be permitted to the extent possible under state laws health 
professionals or others who violated confidentiality standards 
outlined in the bill intentionally or negligently could be fined 
up to 10000 for each offense 
the measure is to be taken up by the full energy and commerce 
committee next month after which it goes to the house floor 
a similar bill is pending in a senate committee 
house members and their staffs haggled over the aids testing 
bill for six months before it was introduced last july and 
negotiations continued right up until thursdays vote the key 
compromise was dropping the antidiscrimination section before 
considering the bill in subcommittee 
unfortunately that policy is caught up in such controversy 
that we will not be able to pursue it at this time subcommittee 
chairman henry waxman dcalif said monday when the panel began 
work on the bill 
jeffrey levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force said the bill is worthwhile even without the 
discrimination ban because of the confidentiality provisions and 
because it mandates a minimum level of counseling including 
information on aids and how to avoid it 
waxman said federal laws and policies already make it clear that 
discrimination by government employers and contractors is 
unacceptable and he said many private employers already are 
acting responsibly 
but rep ron wyden dore said he would fight to restore the 
discrimination ban this year and if he has to in the next 
congress 
there is a real question about the private sector wyden 
said he also contended that many americans will be reluctant to 
come forward for voluntary testing if they are then open to blatant 
discrimination on the basis of the results 
the subcommittee considered dozens of amendments in the course 
of three days of work this week on the bill the panel approved 
mandatory testing of people convicted of intravenous drug use 
prostitution or a crime related to sexual assault and made it a 
crime for a person to contribute to a blood bank or have sexual 
relations if he knows he has aids or carries the aids virus 
amendments requiring testing of marriage license applicants and 
people admitted to hospitals were rejected the subcommittee also 
refused to require that public health authorities be given the 
names addresses and phone numbers of people who dont have aids 
but test positive for the virus that causes it 
in a final compromise thursday the subcommittee agreed to a 
section saying money under the bill cannot be used for counseling 
that promotes or encourages directly homosexual or unsafe 
heterosexual activity or intravenous substance abuse the 
amendment also says counselors must supply the most current 
scientific knowledge available provided that any informational 
materials used are not obscene 
the amendment arose from an educational comic book and videotape 
produced by the gay mens health crisis in new york which receives 
federal money rep william dannemeyer rcalif said the comic 
book depicts two males in every state of undress and sexual 
contact the mind can conjure 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their 
offspring there is no cure for the disease which damages the 
bodys immune system

sunflowerseed oil exports would be subsidized 
under proposed procedures to carry out a new program ordered by 
congress the agriculture department announced thursday

so they can charge less to foreign customers thereby boosting 
sunflowerseed oil exports

directed usda to buy 10 million worth of sunflowerseed oil to 
facilitate additional export sales of sunflowerseed oil

a 110 million tax increase is on its way to 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis desk a package that state 
republicans hope will embarrass dukakis as he campaigns for 
president on a reputation as a taxcutter 
hes projecting himself as a tough lawandorder governor as 
a handson manager and as a budgetbalancer hes none of those 
sen david locke a state cochairman for republican george bush 
said thursday 
the tax package includes 70 million to couple the state income 
tax with the federal code and 40 million from a tobacco sales tax 
dukakis approves the former but has sent mixed signals on the 
latter 
the cigarette tax passed the state senate on wednesday following 
a bizarre lockout protest by republican legislators it is 
expected to land on dukakis desk after a rubberstamp final vote 
by both houses 
the governors administration and finance secretary frank 
keefe supports the measure but dukakis aides hastily said that 
keefe was speaking for himself 
dukakis before leaving to campaign in california insisted that 
the state can balance its books without the tax proposal 
the governors position has been ill take a look at it im 
not supporting it dukakis chief secretary hale champion said 
thursday 
asked about the cigarette tax dukakis told reporters thursday 
theyll be working this out and when the budget gets to 
conference well sit down and decide if we need additional 
revenue 
in an unusual legislative tactic six senate republicans failed 
to return to the senate chamber wednesday evening they locked 
themselves in a senate office and either took the phones off the 
hook or ignored calls from senate leaders 
meanwhile senate democrats in a voice vote quickly passed the 
cigarette tax as well as the 70 million income tax coupling bill 
the republicans said they were hoping to delay action on the tax 
increase proposals while at the same time trying and succeeding 
to draw media attention to the tax bills 
i would not be surprised if it were almost a machiavellian 
plot by democrats to put tax bills on his desk and have him veto 
them locke said he is desperately trying to assume the mantle 
of a taxcutter 
fellow gop sen paul cellucci sees the cigarette tax as a 
relatively minor issue compared to the states budget woes 
lowerthanexpected state revenues have forced several downward 
revisions in the 12 billion budget plan dukakis filed in january 
why is the budget he filed at least half a billion dollars out 
of balance if not more cellucci said the answer is a simple 
one theres been no discipline in spending 
during floor debate locke called the proposal a premonition 
of what lies ahead for america 
when they elect the duke this is exactly what you are going 
to get when they run out of dough they raise taxes he said 
senate president william bulger a boston democrat who supports 
dukakis derided the republican lockout as a publicity stunt 
the minority party was well aware of whats been going on 
bulger said im not sure what constitutes childish behavior on 
the part of republicans theres no reason for them to have been 
gone for so long republicans know theyre not smart what they 
do is look for attention

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis pressed his demand thursday for a full 
explanation of cia links with panamas manuel noriega and 
ridiculed vice president george bushs comments on the subject 
dukakis campaigning in advance of californias june 7 primary 
also gave the back of his hand to several of the vice presidents 
recent drug proposals 
the question is why havent these been done the past seven 
years isnt the vice president in charge of this effort he 
asked 
the massachusetts governor also said it was proper and 
appropriate that house speaker jim wright pledged his cooperation 
with any ethics committee probe into allegations of financial 
irregularities 
beyond that dukakis offered no defense of the democratic 
speaker but he said bush should not try to exploit any 
difficulties wright might face 
this administration has very serious problems he said 
weve got a justice department thats a laughing stock and weve 
got this noriega mess on our hands 
at a news conference dukakis also said im going to continue 
to insist on a full explanation from the administration about 
whats going on concerning noriega 
the vice president was asked a few weeks ago whether we are 
paying noriega he said i cant confirm that or deny that hes 
not running for press spokesman of the cia hes supposed to be 
running for president of the united states dukakis said 
are there links with the cia who were the people that were 
involved in drugrunning and profitskimming and who was it in 
this administration who thought that that made sense 
dukakis made his comments as fresh poll results showed him 
leading jesse jackson in advance of californias democratic primary 
and running ahead of bush in the state as well 
the california poll said dukakis has the support of 53 percent 
of the states voters compared to 40 percent for the vice president 
among those making a choice 
the comment about bush and noriega came at a news conference 
during a day designed to depict the governor as a futureoriented 
leader 
he visited a companysponsored day care center and aides later 
distributed a prepared statement calling for improved day care 
around the country 
in a speech to syntex co employees dukakis also said the 
united states needs to redirect some research and development money 
away from the military and into civilian use 
responding to a question at the news conference dukakis 
repeated his stance that hes unable to guarantee he wont raise 
taxes if he reaches the white house although he said that would be 
his last resort 
he also declined to say whether he would sign a cigarette tax 
increase moving through the massachusetts legislature 
theyll be working this out and when the budget gets to 
conference well sit down and decide if we need additional 
revenue he said

office of aircraft operations circumvented budget processes to 
purchase the pair of bell 212s but now cannot identify a specific 
program to justify them 
oao got the rotors and the taxpayers got the shaft he said 
noaas office of public affairs said the agency had no immediate 
comment on the award 
proxmire who makes the monthly award for ridiculous ironic 
or wasteful spending said the aircraft office originally 
justified the choppers as a way of improving safety in noaas 
program in the arctic 
he said that the aircraft operations office which was 
established in 1983 to better manage noaa aircraft use neglected 
to mention to congress that the arctic programs funding was 
being phased down 
he quoted an unidentified noaa manager as saying it was highly 
uncertain that the program would even continue after 1988 
as a result of these cuts one of the helicopters logged only 
40 hours of flying time last year proxmire said i doubt that 
many of these hours were spent exploring the arctic continental 
shelf since the helicopter was kept at oao headquarters in miami 
for the last 20 months 
only one new noaa program a porpoise survey in the eastern 
tropical pacific will need helicopters but the bell 212s 
arent suited for this project according to the senator 
it would be easy to call this a flybynight scheme but even 
that would overstate these helicopters actual usefulness 
proxmire said for a purchase that should never have seen the 
light northern or otherwise oao deserves this months fleece

democratic presidential contender jesse 
jackson said thursday that the upcoming superpower summit is a step 
in the right direction but that other nations should be included 
in future meetings 
when reagan and gorbachev meet in the soviet union they 
represent 500 million people oneeighth of the human race 
seveneighths will be locked out of the meeting that has to 
change jackson said 
still he said holding the summit is the right thing to do 
to talk it out and not shoot it out our future is to choose 
negotiation over confrontation the human race over the arms race 
jackson made his remarks at a rally with about 1000 students at 
racially mixed independence high school in san jose 50 miles south 
of san francisco 
he was concluding a 10day campaign tour of california where 
polls suggest he is running far behind massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis for the june 7 primary 
in his campus rally jackson said he believed he was having an 
impact on dukakis views on south africa jackson has been urging 
that south africa be designated a terrorist state and has been 
trying to bring dukakis around to that view 
dukakis says he wouldnt rule it out but also says he believes 
economic sanctions would be a more effective first step 
he is adjusting to a new agenda jackson said he said 
dukakis is following his lead on the matter as well as on drug 
issues 
jackson again criticized the reagan administration for the 
disgraceful practice of negotiating with drug dealers which 
discredits our government and is beneath our dignity he repeated 
his familiar antidrug message to the students 
i challenge you today lets stop drugs crack heroin 
cocaine pcp drugs are dreambusters drugs destroy your mind 
your body your character your good judgment as president i 
can stop the supply of drugs you must stop the demand for drugs

the soviet union said thursday it had 100300 
soldiers in afghanistan when the withdrawal began may 15 it was 
the first count the kremlin had given in the eight years since it 
joined the afghan civil war 
the number provided by marshal sergei f akhromeyev chief of 
the general staff and a first deputy defense minister was nearly 
15000 below western intelligence estimates 
soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 
replaced one communist government with another and stayed to fight 
moslem guerrillas 
akhromeyev gave the figure at a news conference the day after 
gen alexei d lizichev another ranking defense ministry official 
provided the first soviet casualty count 13310 soldiers killed 
35478 wounded and 311 missing lizichev had refused to reveal the 
size of the soviet force 
western diplomats in islamabad pakistan said thursday large 
soviet convoys were moving at night in northern afghanistan in an 
effort to speed the withdrawal 
they said a major movement from kabul north through the salang 
pass began early wednesday and continued thursday but they did not 
have the number of soldiers involved 
night travel is unusual and risky particularly in the shomali 
area just north of kabul where reports indicated heavy fighting 
recently the diplomats said the reports said guerrillas had taken 
qarabagh and bagram towns about 30 miles north of the capital 
the diplomats in islamabad all of whom spoke on condition of 
anonymity said they had no indications from kabul that rebel 
pressure had impeded soviet withdrawal 
when journalists at the news conference asked gen akhromeyev 
for the number of soldiers he replied the contingent in 
afghanistan as of may 15 numbered 100300 he said 9500 soldiers 
had left since the withdrawal began 
reports have said about 20000 would be out by sunday when the 
ussoviet summit begins in moscow under the agreement signed 
april 14 in geneva half the force is to be withdrawn by aug 15 
and all soviet soldiers must be gone within nine months 
earlier this week reports from islamabad quoted diplomats as 
saying only two soviet units totaling about 3000 soldiers had left 
since may 15 
diego cordovez the un mediator who arranged the accord said 
thursday in geneva the agreement is slowly falling into place 
and we have a feeling that the implementation has started on the 
whole in an effective manner

the environmental protection agency on 
thursday designated scores of additional counties generally in 
fartherout suburban areas that must be considered part of urban 
areas failing to meet clean air standards 
if the counties eventually are included in new air pollution 
control plans the agency is requiring it could mean tighter 
controls on their industries and possibly auto pollution 
inspections if not already in force 
the designation was made in formal notices to 44 state governors 
and the mayor of the district of columbia the agency said it was 
disapproving air pollution control plans or revoking previous 
approval for cities and a handful of rural areas that do not meet 
air quality standards the notices said the additional counties 
must be considered in new plans 
states are being given 60 days to submit schedules on which they 
will draw up new plans which can take two years to fulfill 
promises in old plans to begin new assessments of actual pollution 
as opposed to computer estimates and to add monitors where epa 
says theyre needed 
the ozone noncompliance areas gained 125 counties and the 
carbon monoxide areas gained 115 
only hawaii north dakota south dakota wyoming iowa and 
vermont do not have noncomplying areas and thus are not getting 
thursdays letter 
epa announced on may 2 that 68 areas fail to meet ozone 
standards and 59 do not meet carbon monoxide standards based on 
19851987 data it had warned last november that it would enlarge 
planning areas but the decision just where the expansions would 
come was made during the last two months generally based on census 
and other economic data 
the failure of the nations cities to meet clean air goals has 
frustrated politicians and policymakers alike for at least a 
decade and there has been no agreement on what to do about it 
congress last december barred the agency from imposing sanctions 
until aug 31 for failure to draw up acceptable control plans thus 
it shelved epa plans to forbid the construction of major new 
sources of pollution in 14 areas where it considered control plans 
inadequate it also told epa to accelerate its annual designation 
of noncomplying areas this year 
in the meantime congress is considering a wide range of changes 
to the clean air act including provisions to deal with the failure 
of the 68 and 59 areas to meet the dec 31 1987 deadline for 
attaining the air quality standards most provisions would award 
more time and require new antipollution steps 
epa administrator lee m thomas told a news conference he was 
doing nothing that would preempt congressional action and 
clearly what im doing is not sufficient to deal with the 
problem 
if congress fails to act thomas said that in the fall he would 
begin to carry out a strategy he outlined last november to require 
new control measures against carbon monoxide and the precursors of 
ozone some measures are in the pipeline already such as draft 
regulations to control gasoline evaporation which helps form ozone

the soviet union canceled one of 
president reagans summit sessions next week with general secretary 
mikhail s gorbachev and objected to the makeup of a religious 
delegation scheduled to see reagan white house officials said 
thursday 
presidential spokesmen sought to minimize the lastminute 
glitches which developed as reagan and his wife nancy attempted to 
overcome jet lag and rest up for the start of the summit in moscow 
sunday 
in washington meanwhile the senate neared presummit approval 
of the historic treaty eliminating intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles that reagan and gorbachev signed at their washington 
summit in december the senate voted overwhelmingly to restrict a 
future presidents power to change the us interpretation of the 
treaty settling the last major issue before floor action on the 
document 
roman popadiuk a white house spokesman said the decision to 
scrub one of reagans five facetoface meetings with gorbachev was 
mutual however chief spokesman marlin fitzwater had said 
earlier that us officials were seeking an explanation 
fitzwater talking to reporters in this finnish capital 
thursday said i regard it as routine a second 
reagangorbachev meeting scheduled for next monday was canceled by 
the soviets for what the kremlin cited as some internal 
function 
fitzwater said the soviets had a scheduling problem with one 
of the reagangorbachev sessions in particular one set for monday 
afternoon 
they needed the time for some internal function he said 
and his office later issued a statement saying the meeting had been 
canceled by mutual decision 
there was no indication whether the cancellation was related in 
any way to a communist party conference the first of its kind 
since 1941 that is scheduled to open in moscow after the summit 
another problem developed when word reached the presidential 
party that the soviets had questioned the participation of one of 
the religious groups scheduled to meet with reagan at the danilov 
monastery on monday 
the meeting itself is still on as far as i know fitzwater 
said he said he did not know which religious group the soviets 
objected to 
reagan also plans to meet separately with a group of jewish 
refuseniks who had been unable to obtain exit permits for 
israel fitzwater said he was unable to verify a complaint that two 
persons had been intercepted by soviet authorities on their way to 
moscow from leningrad 
a white house official speaking on condition he not be 
identified by name said the administration had been assured that 
everyone thats been invited will attend the monday afternoon 
session 
on the official level the soviets have shown no concern over 
the meeting planned between reagan and soviet refuseniks at a 
press conference to discuss the forthcoming summit us affairs 
expert georgy a arbatov and communist party central committee 
official nikolai shishlin both stated that they considered reagans 
meeting partners his own business 
but deputy foreign minister vladimir f petrovsky said this 
american move is hardly aimed at improving mutual understanding 
between the usa and ussr 
as far as the planned reagan meeting with refuseniks and 
dissidents is concerned petrovsky said it looks in a 
different light since the point at issue is an obviously 
tendentious selection of the participants 
petrovsky said the us president who will be our guest in 
moscow is certainly free to decide who of soviet citizens he finds 
interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of the 
official events 
dozens of refuseniks demonstrating in moscow thursday said they 
want human rights to figure prominently in the reagangorbachev 
meetings 
a leningrad refusenik said in a telephone interview that kgb 
secret police has warned him against accepting an invitation to 
meet reagan on monday 
roald alec zelichonok who has been refused permission to 
emigrate for more than 10 years said he received a letter and 
telephone call tuesday from the us embassy inviting him to take 
part in the meeting with reagan shortly after the embassy phone 
call he said a kgb officer telephoned 
this officer called and said in light of security measures 
around moscow my departure for moscow will not be permitted 
zelichonok said by telephone from his leningrad home 
zelichonok 51 said the officer warned him that if he traveled 
to moscow administrative measures carrying possible penalties 
of detention house arrest or up to 15 days in jail would be taken 
against him 
despite the white houses efforts to smooth over any 
differences the schedule change and rumors that the soviets were 
attempting to restrict access to reagan contributed a measure of 
uncertainty to his fourth summit meeting with gorbachev 
the presummit jockeying came as the reagans remained in 
seclusion at an official finnish guesthouse here a plush retreat 
furnished with an indoor sauna and pool and located in a wooded 
residential area 
in a private waterside park near the guesthouse americas 
first couple took a 30minute stroll greeted local citizens 
and reagan threw stones across the water a white house statement 
said 
reagan delivers a presummit address on human rights here 
friday and rests again saturday before leaving sunday for the 
fiveday moscow summit 
as he awaited word from the senate on ratification of the treaty 
banning mediumrange missiles reagans top arms negotiator max 
kampelman expressed confidence that the superpowers would dispense 
with some knotty problems on a more farreaching pact aimed at 
halving their arsenals of strategic missiles 
reagan also met briefly with his senior advisers to go over the 
final details of the summit schedule omitting the second monday 
meeting and lengthening the times of other meetings the white 
house statement said 
overall the president still will spend six hours with 
gorbachev because the remaining sessions will be expanded 
fitzwater said 
fitzwater told reporters that reagan is going over a 3inch 
briefing book and six months after he started has finished 
gorbachevs book perestroika on his plans to revitalize his 
countrys troubled economy 
the advisers who huddled with reagan were not identified but it 
appeared most white house officials attempted to follow reagans 
laidback approach by enjoying finlands light breezes and bright 
northern sun 
fitzwater refused to hold a formal press briefing and tried to 
flee reporters who peppered him with questions as he exited his 
hotel 
secretary of state george shultz and the presidents top arms 
control advisers kampelman edward rowney and paul nitze were 
spotted taking a cruise about the citys harbor 
unless the senate acts in time to rush the inf treaty to reagan 
for the formal exchange of ratification documents in moscow the 
summit has no expectation of major results 
in an interview tuesday with a group of west european 
jouralists reagan left open the possibility of a fifth summit with 
gorbachev before he leaves office in january if negotiators can 
complete the treaty to reduce longrange nuclear missiles 
i wont rule it out reagan said in a text released on 
thursday i wont say its impossible i would hope that we 
can iron out the still undecided points before i leave

in a stopgap measure to deal with a domestic 
nursing shortage the federal government on thursday granted a 
blanket oneyear visa extension for thousands of foreign nurses 
working in the united states 
the immigration and naturalization service acted following an 
appeal last friday by 42 members of congress that it grant an 
extension 
in addition to granting a blanket extension coverting 
fiveyear visas to sixyear visas for foreign nurses ins 
commissioner alan c nelson said agency district director will 
have discretionary authority to grant additional time on a 
casebycase basis 
guidelines for exercising the discretionary authority are being 
developed nelson said in a statement 
meanwhile he urged hospitals to redouble their efforts to 
recruit and retain us nurses and congress to seek a longterm 
solution to a domestic nursing shortage that administrators say 
makes it essential for them to employ foreignborn nurses 
rep charles e schumer dny one of the lawmakers who urged 
the extension called the ins response an act of compassion 
there is a desperate shortage of nurses in many parts of the 
country schumer said even though we all agree that additional 
steps must be taken to expand training programs for more american 
nurses and improve their pay we cannot afford to wait at this 
point 
schumer pledged to work for legislation to attack the problem 
the extension doesnt solve the nations nursing shortage but it 
does buy time he said 
about 2000 foreign nurses 18 percent of the total recruited by 
american hospitals would have been sent home this year had the ins 
not extended their visas most work in new york or california 
an estimated 300000 nursing jobs are unfilled nationwide a 
vacancy rate that ranges from 10 percent to 20 percent in various 
cities 
the call for visa extensions was backed by nurses unions as a 
temporary measure while more american nurses can be recruited and 
trained union leaders say the profession demands more status and 
higher pay especially for nurses with longterm experience who 
tend to quit because of burnout and lack of incentives 
but they say it will take time to accomplish those changes and 
that foreign nurses are needed in the meantime 
kenneth raske head of the greater new york hospital 
association said the visa extension averted a potential public 
health crisis in new york city were an estimated 4000 foreign 
nurses work and about onefifth faced deportation this year 
officials in new jersey estimated about 200 of the 918 foreign 
nurses working there would have been subject to deportation this 
year without the extension

neighbors fed up with drug users and prostitutes 
using a nearby house followed up trashing the place by torching it 
police said 
about 25 residents on the citys southwest side stormed the 
house tuesday night and routed the occupants with baseball bats and 
pipes engaging some occupants in fist fights thursday morning 
the house was set on fire and authorities suspect the people 
simply finished the job they started 
get out now and move were spray painted on the front 
door when the house was ransacked 
sure it was a lynch mob one resident said but what are 
you going to do we have to be vigilantes 
police who learned of the row only after it ended said no 
arrests were made the fire in which no one was hurt likely will 
go unprosecuted too police said 
some neighbors said the incidents resulted from years of 
frustration that had built up in the once tidy ethnic neighborhood 
of mostly polish lithuanian and ukrainian families 
the neighborhood has changed gradually over the past 20 years 
but in the last five years it has accelerated said jack 
vassallo a senior social planner and developer for the detroit 
employment and training department who has lived in the 
neighborhood 55 years there are dope houses car thefts 
prostitutes you name it i really hate to see the neighborhood go 
down like this 
neighborhood residents said they had asked for police help 
numerous times but authorities said they had no record of 
requests except for a narcotics complaint late last year 
you cant take the law into your own hands 4th precinct

president pw botha said 
thursday his national party is the best hope for ending the 
nations deep racial divisions which critics say the party created 
in 40 years of unbroken rule 
two bombs exploded at lunchtime on busy streets of pretoria 
wounding four white women one of whom lost an arm law and order 
minister adriaan vlok blamed the african national congress the 
main guerrilla group fighting white domination 
in a speech marking the 40th anniversary of national party 
power botha said the party is pursuing gradual reforms that have 
broadened democracy while guarding against revolution 
his nationalists are best known for the apartheid policy which 
has formalized and strengthened racial segregation since they 
gained power in the election of may 26 1948 
botha has pursued limited reform since taking charge in 1978 but 
his partys objective remains the preservation of political and 
economic control for the 5 million whites south africas 26 
million blacks have no voice in national affairs 
on thursday botha said the national party will never allow 
militant antiapartheid groups to take power because we dont 
want a dictatorship that restricts the freedom of people 
he conceded some mistakes by the party during four decades in 
power but did not name them and said we did much more right 
than we did wrong 
we will succeed just as we succeeded in the past when we 
brought great things into being in this country he told his 
audience in parow just outside cape town 
the bombs exploded within five minutes and two blocks of each 
other on busy street corners of the capital the four women injured 
were librarians in their 30s returning to work from lunch police 
and witnesses said 
spokesmen at the hf verwoerd hospital said all the injuries 
were caused by the second bomb in addition to the woman whose arm 
was blown off they reported two had extensive facial burns and the 
fourth suffered back injuries 
about five minutes earlier a bomb destroyed a parked car but 
caused no injuries 
these cowardly and unscrupulous deeds are characteristic of 
the desperate attempts being waged by the anc to practice 
terrorism vlok said 
in addis ababa ethiopia the anc military commander joe 
modise said basically we do have men with bombs and no one 
else carries out this type of operation inside the country 
modise was in ethiopia for the organization of african unity 
summit 
more than 70 bombs have exploded in south africa since a state 
of emergency was declared june 12 1986 to thwart an uprising in 
black townships 
in a signed article recently in the sunday star of johannesburg 
botha reflected on how the national party has shaped south africa 
over four decades 
human resources are a countrys most valuable asset he 
wrote that is why since coming into power the national party 
has pursued a policy which offers all the republic of south 
africas inhabitants maximal quality of life and development 
opportunities 
progovernment papers praised the party this week and said it is 
best qualified to resolve racial problems 
the troubles we have had in the last two or three years are 
nothing compared with the troubles we would have if the government 
had not started to dismantle apartheid the citizen said in an 
editorial tuesday 
an editorial in the star held the national party largely 
responsible for the nations problems and said it had not offered 
solutions 
triumphant the government may feel yet it is threatened by a 
mounting white backlash on its right and a mighty tide of anger 
from black south africa and the outside world on its left the 
star said thursday 
at its founding in 1914 the party was intended as a vehicle for 
promoting the interests of afrikaners descendants of the dutch 
french and german settlers who arrived in south africa in the 17th 
century 
after losing to the british in the boer war of 18991902 many

us diplomats held highlevel consultations 
with latin american democracies thursday in search of new ways for 
encouraging military leader manuel antonio noriega to leave panama 
a state department official said 
hours after the collapse wednesday of the us negotiating 
effort assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said 
ambassadors in latin american capitals were ordered to meet with 
hostcountry presidents and foreign ministers on thursday to 
discuss the issue 
the envoys were asked to tell these governments what happened 
in detail and to ask for their advice in helping us move forward 
abrams told reporters after testifying before a closeddoor hearing 
of the senate foreign relations committee 
appearing on the macneillehrer newshour thursday night 
undersecretary of state michael armacost indicated that the central 
american democracies will play an increasingly active role in 
mediating a settlement in panama 
i think its an excellent idea armacost said noting that 
several central american countries have a tremendous storehouse 
of experience in the transition to civilian democratic rule 
secretary of state george p shultz announced wednesday the 
failure of the negotiation which was aimed at inducing noriega to 
resign as commander of the panamanian defense forces and go into 
exile as part of the proposed deal us drugsmuggling 
indictments against noriega would have been dropped 
noriega panamas de facto ruler rejected the proposal and 
shultz said no further negotiations were planned 
with abrams at his side sen christopher dodd dconn 
expressed regret over the setback but many others in congress 
seemed pleased at the outcome 
sen john kerry dmass said a lot of people are not upset 
that it fell apart 
kerry said the negotiations hurt us foreign policy and also 
sent a terrible message with respect to our ability to do something 
about the narcotics traffic 
panamanian ambassador juan sosa who is allied with forces 
opposed to noriega said the united states should hold back and 
let other initiatives go forward 
sosa said the reagan administration negotiated in good faith but 
should not have dealt with a terrorist the problem is noriega is 
not an honorable person he said 
later sosa conferred with state department officials on the 
possibility of a central american diplomatic effort to resolve the 
crisis 
he said diplomatic contacts have been made since wednesday with 
guatemalan president vinicio cerezo who is expected to play a lead 
role in any mediation effort by the four central american 
democracies the three others are costa rica el salvador and 
honduras 
the administration has resisted significant involvement in the 
panama issue by other hemispheric governments but has now shifted 
its strategy somewhat after calling a halt to its own initiative 
although noriega has little overt support in latin america 
hemispheric nations have indicated deep reservations about the 
administrations approach to the problem 
one example of this was a meeting of 26 latin american countries 
two months ago at which a resolution was passed criticizing the 
us economic sanctions against panama 
in the aftermath of the negotiating failure us officials said 
they attributed the setback to one or a combination of reasons 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said it was possible 
that noriega had no intention of a serious negotiation from the 
beginning and was stringing the united states along 
another possible explanation they said was that noriegas 
allies in the defense forces vetoed the proposed deal on the 
grounds that the arrangement offered them no guarantees that they 
would not be punished by a successor government for their 
association with noriega 
finally the officials said noriega may have been negotiating 
in good faith all along but when the moment came for a decision he 
was unable to agree to a package that would cost him his job and 
send him into temporary exile 
elsewhere on capitol hill assistant defense secretary richard 
armitage said under questioning by the senate defense 
appropriations subcommittee i dont think anyone has totally 
precluded use of force to force noriegas removal you always 
have that option open 
but if we can find a way that serves the interest of democracy 
in panama and the interests of the majority of the panamian people 
and our own national security interests without resorting to 
shedding of us and panamian blood that is the right direction 
armitage added 
sen alfonse damato rny a strong critic of dealings with 
noriega and the us militarys reluctance to get involved said 
the panamanian leader had successfully divided the doves in the 
pentagon from realists in the state department in the use of 
force 
damato criticized the use of a thirdstring secretary of 
state for negotiations with noriega and said the administration 
should have sent somebody like united nations ambassador vernon 
walters who is a retired general or some other three or 
fourstar general 
the main us envoy in the conflict with panama has been deputy 
assistant secretary of state michael kozak

convinced that another oil crisis lies down 
the road a group of environmentalists oil companies and state 
governors thursday announced a new attempt to forge solutions 
before problems crop up 
the denverbased group the american energy assurance council 
said its members hope to stage a 48hour simulated oil crisis in 
the third week of november with 100 participants and persuade one 
of the television networks to make an hourlong program out of it 
polls indicate that national leaders and the american public 
are convinced there will be another energy crisis said one of 
the organizers gov george a sinner of north dakota but he 
added energy policy has fallen off the national agenda 
especially since crude oil plunged from 28 a barrel to less than 
10 in 1986 
charles ebinger a staff member at the center for strategic and 
international studies and an energy consultant said the purpose 
of the game is to convince everyone that on the basis of the 
current impasse that no one is going to win their agenda 
environmentalists may see their interests run roughshod over 
in another crisis and oil and gas companies may have to accept 
price controls again which isnt in their interests either 
ebinger said 
the rules of the game have not been decided upon when it is 
over organizers of the group hope to get conflicting interests to 
start serious bargaining on a few unspecified topics where 
agreement might be possible 
crude prices have recovered to about 18 but are still 
considered low in the oil patch asked why an oil crisis was 
likely michael beatty senior vice president of coastal corp a 
houstonbased oil and gas producer said low prices are 
stimulating consumption and rapidly expanding demand for cheap 
overseas oil 
crude and product imports now account for 39 percent of us 
consumption up from 34 percent this time last year 
john jenkins president of the group said it will try to 
grapple with conflicting solutions such as the 
conservationatanyprice vision backed by some environmental 
organizations and the expandproductioneverywhere solution of some 
oil companies 
we are working together with people whose views we vehemently 
disagree with beatty said 
the group includes consevation advocate amory lovins and a 
consumingstate governor thomas kean of new jersey

a senator thursday accused the justice 
departments civil rights chief william bradford reynolds of 
lying to congress and of rejecting the advice of subordinates who 
called for an fbi probe of a republican party voter registration 
challenge in louisiana 
at a senate judiciary committee hearing sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio disclosed memos by civil rights division subordinates 
urging that the fbi investigate possible criminal violations of the 
voting rights act in connection with a gop voter registration 
challenge aimed at predominantly black precincts in louisiana in 
1986 
in march 1987 reynolds told the committee that it was the 
conclusion of everybody who looked at the matter from the 
divisions voting section that there was no violation of the 
voting rights act that would allow us to go in and prosecute 
you misstated the facts you lied to the committee 
metzenbaum told reynolds at a judiciary committee hearing thursday 
you state things in halftruths responded reynolds 
what kind of halftruths what kind of halftruths yelled 
metzenbaum 
reynolds said that another part of the justice department the 
criminal division was consulted on the matter and concluded that 
no criminal investigation was warranted 
reynolds and a deputy jim turner insisted that subordinates in 
the civil rights division ended up agreeing that no fbi probe was 
warranted 
since the case involved the republican party i wanted to be 
darn sure i wasnt going to do something they would question us 
about later said reynolds 
metzenbaum released an oct 7 1986 memo by rebecca wertz an 
attorney in the voting section urging the fbis entry into the 
matter the senator also released another oct 7 memo this one to 
reynolds from gerald jones chief of the voting section which 
called for discussions on the appropriateness of having the 
criminal section coordinate the investigation 
in addition civil rights division investigators wrote a 
threepage document that would have been sent by reynolds to the 
fbi director detailing the proposed scope of a criminal probe 
attached to the threepage document was a note from jones to turner 
saying as indicated in the earlier briefing papers we sent to 
brad re the louisiana voter challenge matter here is the fbi 
request we propose to send out 
but at the bottom of wertz memo reynolds said in a handwritten 
note 
there is under the circumstances no legitimate reason to 
initiate an fbi investigation of the la activities the note 
said that a state court injunction had brought the voter challenge 
activity to a halt that no voters were denied registration rights 
and that there was no real prospect they would be 
on the other hand there appears to be a concern of possible 
harassment fraud and intimidation of blacks in the upcoming 
election said reynolds note to the extent such behavior is 
found we may well want to initiate an fbi investigation after the 
nov 4 elections no such probe was ever launched 
after the hearing reynolds aides said they had provided 
metzenbaum with additional documents on the proposed fbi probe 
none of the additional documents however touched on any 
involvement by the criminal division in recommending against a 
probe said aides to metzenbaum 
reynolds is counselor to attorney general edwin meese iii as 
well as assistant attorney general in charge of the justice 
departments civil rights division

lebanon and a survivor of the ambush 
kenaan syrias military intelligence chief in lebanon told 
reporters in the lebanese capital upon his return from damascus

do its utmost to gain freedom for the captives including nine 
americans

500 when it was hit with dozens of bullets and the gas tank was 
holed forcing the generals to abandon the car and drive away in 
one of the others in the convoy 
the other officers were brig gens ali hammoud intelligence 
chief for the beirut area and zuheir musattati a deputy to

syria will spare no effort to secure their release regardless of 
their nationality said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he told ap correspondent nick ludington that the accord has been 
approved by all parties concerned including iran 
it was not clear if the hostages were part of the deal but 
irans acting foreign minister ali mohammed besharati predicted 
last week that the hostage problem would be solved after peace was 
restored in south beirut 
syria has had thousands of troops ringing the slums for days 
but a syrian source in damascus said syria never believed it was 
possible to obtain release of the hostages by force the source 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the first priority 
was to preserve the hostages lives then there can be hope for 
their release through negotiations

panama and cuba both targets of us 
economic sanctions were elected to the un human rights 
commission on thursday in what was seen as a slap at us policies 
in latin america 
colombia also was elected 
western diplomats said the election of cuba which has been 
accused by the united states of widespread human rights violations 
had been expected because of its strong standing in the nonaligned 
movement 
cuba replaces nicaragua and is expected to vote in generally the 
same way 
the secretballot vote for panama however appeared to be a 
strong sympathy vote for that government and a show of anger over 
us sanctions and failed efforts to oust its de facto leader gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
noriega is under indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges 
the losers were costa rica whose president oscar arias won 
the nobel peace prize last year for his central american peace 
plan and guatemala panama defeated costa rica in a runoff ballot 
ethiopia was elected unopposed as one of the african 
representatives in another regional vote ethiopian authorities 
have blocked food relief for faminestricken regions in an effort 
to prevent it from reaching rebels 
the three latin american nations were seated for threeyear 
terms on the major un human rights organization they were 
elected by the 54member economic and social council the parent 
body 
panamas ambassador leonardo a kamm said the vote was a 
victorious message from the people of panama to those conspiring 
to isolate our nation diplomatically the votes cast for us 
demonstrate the political role my country continues to play in the 
international arena 
cuban ambassador oscar oramas oliva said the vote showed that 
his country had international support despite efforts by us 
officials dedicated to a campaign of provocation and lies who 
sought to condemn cuba for purported human rights abuses 
this is a victory for truth reason and the people he said 
adding that cuba was committed to preserving human rights 
cuba was elected on the first ballot winning 38 votes 10 more 
than the required 28 colombia received 46 votes and panama 31 
the election was to fill three latin american seats on the 
43member commission which represents regional groups

thursday noted that it is widely rumored that robinson has aids 
and hes aware of that 
the curiosity has at times annoyed me robinson said im 
just not going to get into the subject of what i have 
robinson whose tv career took off when he became an anchorman 
in washington in 1969 moved to the abc network in 1978 when he 
frank reynolds and peter jennings were the three anchors on world 
news tonight

they operate in the shadow of world leaders 
these witnesses to history who work mostly in anonymity while 
greasing the skids of international diplomacy 
they are the interpreters at superpower summits and president 
reagan and soviet leader gorbachev could not converse without them 
for the summit in moscow next week harry obst head of the 
state departments language unit is sending eight interpreters 
who do oral translations and four translators for written work 
language support is the most crucial element of the whole 
operation says obst whose unit employs 50 interpreters and 
translators with another 1800 linguists on contract to supply the 
government with services in 60 to 70 languages 
turning russian into english and vice versa is not their only 
role as witnesses to the teteatetes between reagan and 
gorbachev the interpreters take notes that constitute the only 
record of conversations that could determine the fate of nations 
its not enough to know one or more foreign languages quick 
wits and a broad general knowledge are essential 
for instance the interpreter assigned to reagan czechborn 
dimitry zarechnak has one degree in mathematics another in 
russian literature zarechnak 44 became the state departments 
senior russian interpreter in 1982 and attended the three previous 
reagangorbachev summits 
interpreters must have great powers of concentration because 
they cant very well turn to a president and ask him to repeat his 
remarks 
and being in shape is important 
william krimer who until his retirement in 1982 was the 
countrys top russian interpreter recalls being stuck in a 
motorcade several cars away from his principal 
the motorcade stopped krimer ran up to offer his services and 
as he finished the cars began to move running back to his car 
krimer saw that he wouldnt make it i opened the door of the 
nearest car to me jumped in and landed in the lap of the joint 
chiefs he said in an interview last year 
that was not the only embarrassment krimer endured after just a 
few months on the job krimer was called to interpret at an arms 
control briefing he kept careful notes of the russian generals 
comments and then sprang into action reading his notes back in 
russian 
when he realized what he was doing and stoppd he said the 
director of the arms control and disarmament agency smiled and told 
the russians well gentlemen at least you see youre getting an 
accurate rendition of the speech 
not all mistakes are so benign an interpreter made president 
carter look a bit foolish in front of his hosts on a 1977 trip to 
poland 
when the president spoke about the poles desires for the 
future interpreter stephen seymours rendition in polish was 
your lusts for the future 
carters when i left the united states was translated into 
when i abandoned the united states 
when former chinese vice premier deng xiaoping visited the 
united states in 1979 he was presented with a 10gallon hat in 
texas 
the diminutive visitor realizing the hat was way too big for 
him handed the hat to his interpreter ji chaozhu who dwarfed deng 
by as much as a full foot 
ji was helpful in other ways when a questioner tried to ask the 
vice premier about the delicate issue of a possible chinese 
invasion of taiwan the interpreter jumped in saying deng had 
answered the question previously 
his action reflected the fact that both the chinese and soviet 
chief interpreters are more than wordsmiths oleg troyanovsky for 
example was the interpreter for the late soviet leader leonid 
brezhnev and later became soviet ambassador to the united nations 
viktor sukhodrev gorbachevs personal interpreter also has a 
top foreign ministry post in moscow 
sukhodrev is a virtual legend on the summit circuit former 
secretary of state henry kissinger describes sukhodrev in his book 
the white house years as splendid and unflappable 
kissinger recalls only one time when sukhodrev was stumped 
former president richard nixon suggested at the 1972 moscow summit 
that certain us and soviet actions in the middle east were 
preparatory to the nutcutting stage 
sukhodrev interpreted the phrase literally as cutting the 
fruit from a tree kissinger wrote to the obvious 
mystification of everyone 
sukhodrev will probably be aided at the moscow summit by pavel 
palazchenko and nikolai uspenskiy said obst zarechnak will be 
assisted by william hopkins and peter afanasenko

a navy officer who defeated fraternization 
charges brought against her because of her relationship with a 
marine enlisted man said thursday she loves the service and hopes 
her case will change military policy 
i love my husband i love the navy and i dont see why the 
two are not compatible lt kathleen a mazure 29 told 
reporters at a news conference a day after a marine corps general 
dropped the charges 
ms mazure a dentist assigned to the marine corps air ground 
combat center at twentynine palms calif was accompanied by her 
husband former lance cpl scott price and her parents jim and 
pat mazure 
i hope that from out of this the fraternization policy will 
become more defined so that people wont have to go through what i 
had to because it is very illdefined she said 
ms mazure formerly of mercer island wash was cleared of all 
charges after tuesdays 4hour hearing before maj gen gene 
deegan said mark rosenbaum an american civil liberties union 
lawyer 
im very proud of my wife for holding up so well said 
price 24 of eden texas who married her nov 28 and left the 
marines after the charges were brought 
the charges brought nov 25 marked the first time in the 
history of the united states that charges of fraternization 
have been brought against an officer for conduct with a member of 
another branch of the service rosenbaum said 
he emphasized that ms mazure and her husband were not in the 
same chain of command 
on jan 11 a hearing was held to determine whether she should 
be courtmartialed and on jan 19 the hearing officer recommended 
there should be no courtmartial rosenbaum said 
deegan overruled the recommendation and on feb 16 the case was 
referred to a courtmartial on monday the courtmartial charges 
were dropped and on tuesday deegan held a nonjudicial hearing that 
resulted in final dismissal of the allegation the attorney said 
a base spokesman chief warrant officer doug hauth said deegan 
was of the opinion that because of her background and training 
and short time assigned to this marine corps command that 
fundamental fairness required that she not be held criminally 
accountable for her relationship 
ms mazure said she does not believe the incident will affect 
her career i feel that the work i do and the way i am should be 
able to show for itself what kind of person i am that i do intend 
to make the navy my career she said 
ms mazure said she was stationed in jacksonville fla when 
she met price during an evening of dancing in july 1986 and that 
neither knew the other was in the service until after several dates 
they kept in touch through letters when price was transferred to 
the california desert base she said she was offered a post at 
twentynine palms and was transferred there on sept 27 1987 
rosenbaum said items presented at tuesdays hearing included a 
document from the office of the chief of naval operations that 
states that there is no formal policy regarding fraternization 
also presented was a 1985 study by the department of navy 
which found that fraternization within ones own chain of 
command was absolutely rampant and that the majority of 
individuals in the navy simply had no idea as to what constitutes 
wrongful fraternization he said

the house banking committees chairman 
introduced legislation thursday that would prevent healthy savings 
institutions from fleeing the ailing federal fund that insures 
their deposits 
sixteen democrats and seven republicans are backing a bill 
introduced by rep fernand j st germain dri it would bar sampls 
from leaving the federal savings and loan insurance corp until 
aug 10 1989 one year longer than a ban currently in effect 
congress last summer included the initial moratorium in 
legislation providing for a 108 billion industryfinanced 
infusion into fslic which insures sampl deposits up to 100000 
because the insurance premium charged by fslic is roughly 2 
times greater than the premium charged the federal deposit 
insurance corp legislators fear that thrifts eligible for 
admission to the fdic will leave fslic and become banks 
the general accounting office the auditing arm of congress 
warned last week that the sampl fund may not have enough money coming 
in to take care of the roughly 500 sampls listed as insolvent 
any flight of healthy institutions whose insurance premiums 
help pay the bills would be a further blow to an already weakened 
fund st germain said in a statement 
st germain introduced the legislation after receiving a letter 
wednesday from the top federal regulator of savings institutions 
federal home loan bank board chairman m danny wall who supports 
extending the moratorium 
wall said the bank board did not know how many sampls would leave 
the fund if they could but he said the most important value in 
this equation at the moment is perception the perception that 
without the moratorium there may be a major exodus from fslic 
mark clark senior vice president of the us league of savings 
institutions the largest trade group in the industry said 
extending the moratorium is unfair to savings institutions and 
breaks the agreement congress made with the industry last year 
we dont advocate mass exodus all were saying is there ought 
to be free choice clark said

the second anticastro terrorist bombing here this 
month forced a forum on uscuba relations out of a downtown hotel 
thursday and some cuban exile leaders say such incidents must end 
the 3 am blast thursday injured no one but demolished a 
garage door tore away part of a concrete wall and blew out the 
windows of a car at the home of maria christina herrera in coral 
gables 
ms herrera a miamidade community college professor who heads 
a group advocating more dialogue with castros cuba sponsored a 
forum on the future of uscuba relations on thursday afternoon 
the site of the forum was hastily moved after the bombing 
this is a cowardly attack she said in her damaged home 
this is an attack on freedom democracy and freedom of expression 
the right to do whatever you want in a civilized way 
the sheratonbrickell point hotel where the forum was to take 
place pulled out after the bombing but university of miami 
president edward t foote agreed to let the university serve as 
host for the event instead in the interests of academic 
freedom said a school spokeswoman conchita ruiztopinka 
the event went off without incident at the universitys faculty 
club where security guards screened everyone who attended 
the fbi and coral gables police were investigating the case no 
one claimed responsibility for the attack but authorities had few 
doubts about its motivation 
she feels that a new approach should be used toward cuba 
said fbi special agent george kiscynski she has probably made 
some enemies in the community and has become the victim of a 
terrorist attack 
the bombing was the second this month apparently aimed at 
protesting closer relations with cuba on may 3 a pipe bomb blew 
in the door of the cuban museum of arts and culture after a show 
featuring some painters still in cuba who critics said were too 
close to cuban leader fidel castro 
some of the same cuban radio talks shows and news programs that 
had called for opposition to the art show also bitterly attacked 
the forum sponsored by ms herreras group the institute of cuban 
studies and she blamed them for inflaming the situation 
all of these people in the community that are haranguing 
people on the radio against our debate today are somewhat 
responsible for this action morally at least she said 
xavier bray founder of the spanish american league against 
discrimination said the attacks undermine the freedoms cubans came 
to the united states to enjoy 
this isnt a question to be settled only by the force of arms 
but by the force of reason by being able to exchange ideas he 
said thursday 
the bombing came 2 hours after a meeting at ms herreras 
house at which conference organizers decided not to include a 
visiting representative of the unofficial cuban human rights 
commission elizardo sanchez santacruz 
he is a former political prisoner given permission by the castro 
government to set up his organization his trip to the united 
states and request to be included in the forum made anticommunists 
here suspicious and the organizers decided his participation would 
only further anger anticastro militants 
sanchez was allowed into the meeting at the university as an 
observer not a participant in the forum 
bill ripple general manager of the sheratonbrickell point 
hotel said the hotel canceled the conference based on the best 
interests of our employees and guests because of the recent 
incidents including the bombing

pregnant women should limit alcohol consumption to 
fewer than 10 drinks a week say researchers who found no evidence 
of physical harm to the fetuses of women who drank below that 
amount 
the study at a hospital coordinating europeanwide studies on 
the issue was reported thursday in the british medical journal 
it found that while most of the 846 women surveyed tended to 
drink little or no alcohol during pregnancy the few who had more 
than 10 drinks weekly had babies with smallerthannormal heads 
babies of mothers who drank more than 12 drinks scored low on a 
standard test of newborns indicating the babies were at 
considerable risk the study of mothers in dundee scotland 
found 
the study defined a standard drink as about 35 ounces of pure 
alcohol or about as much as in a glass of wine eight ounces of 
beer or 118 ounces of hard liquor 
although some previous studies reached similar findings for low 
levels of maternal drinking other studies linked even light 
drinking with increased risk of slight neurological and behavioral 
defects in the child 
medical authorities generally recommend that pregnant women 
avoid alcohol entirely no safe consumption level has been 
firmly established and some fetuses may be particularly 
susceptible they warn 
authors of the new study say their findings indicate that more 
attention should be paid to detecting and helping mothers whose 
drinking puts their fetuses at special risk 
according to our results we didnt think social drinking 
created any harm said dr nabeel sulaiman of the department of 
community medicine at ninewells hospital and medical school where 
the research was conducted he added the majority of mothers do 
abstain or drink very little after learning they were pregnant 
but 2 percent of our women drank more than 10 drinks per week 
that is the risky group if we want to do anything in terms of 
health education we should point it toward these he told the 
associated press 
the 19851986 study published in the may 28 issue of the 
journal was carried out at ninewells a hospital where almost 
every dundee woman has her baby 
sulaiman said the fact that women in the area have little choice 
but to go to ninewells to deliver helped provide a better 
crosssection of the population 
the report based on first children found that most women 
naturally tended to drink less or not at all during pregnancy 
before realizing they were pregnant 90 percent of the women 
drank but by the end of the first four months of pregnancy only 56 
percent drank and in later months only 2 percent 
it said a sample of 230 mothers said they drank less due to 
concern for their baby problems with nausea a lack of opportunity 
or because it smelled or tasted bad 
from the 92 percent of our sample who were either nondrinkers 
or consuming less than 50 grams 175 ounces absolute alcohol 
per week we conclude that social drinking at a low level is very 
unlikely to have a harmful effect on the fetus said the article 
as there was no detectable effect on pregnancy of alcohol 
consumption below 100 grams 350 ounces per week it is 
suggested that health education should be directed toward mothers 
who drink more than this amount 
in conclusion the article said we would advise women who are 
planning to become pregnant to limit their alcohol consumption 
to below 10 drinks per week 
mothers who consumed more than 10 drinks weekly had babies with 
smaller circumference heads which implies on average that the 
baby hasnt developed to the same degree as others said dr 
charles du v florey another of the four authors

the first soviet experts to visit a 
chemical weapons facility in western europe accused the united 
states thursday of blocking progress on a global treaty banning the 
weapons 
at a news conference the soviet and british envoys to the 
40nation treaty negotiations disagreed about the consequences of 
americas resumption of the production of binary chemical weapons 
last december 
yuri nazarkin chief soviet envoy to the talks in geneva said 
the us plans undoubtedly run counter to the aim of a chemical 
weapons convention and they undermine the confidencebuilding 
process 
but nazarkin said the threeday visit to britains chemical 
warfare defense center by a 13member group of soviet technical and 
military experts helped pave the way for a chemical weapons ban 
we firmly believe that this convention will be achievable 
soon he said 
he said british officials were forthcoming in talks and helpful 
in showing the soviets around the sprawling 7000acre facility at 
porton down where the soviets watched soldiers in gas masks react 
to a simulated nerve gas attack 
tessa solesby the british negotiator at the geneva talks said 
washington resumed making chemical weapons to counter the soviets 
production and to replace aging stockpiles 
miss solesby also rejected arguments by nazarkin that the geneva 
talks needed a push from the american soviet and british leaders 
and said the main problem was the difficulty of verifying any 
agreement 
it is not a matter of lack of political will its the 
technical difficulties that remain she said 
dr graham pearson director of the porton down center said the 
soviet visit was a significant first step toward building 
confidence between the soviet union and the united kingdom 
britain ceased making chemical weapons and destroyed its 
stockpile in the 1950s and says porton down is only for defensive 
measures such as the production of gas masks and monitoring 
equipment 
in july a british team will visit the chemical warfare facility 
at shikhany in eastern russia 
western experts visited shikhany briefly last year and soviet 
inspectors went to a us army chemical weapons disposal plant in 
toole utah 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev acknowledged last year for 
the first time that the soviet union has a chemical weapon 
stockpile which he put at 50000 tons but said production of more 
weapons had stopped 
western governments say the soviet stockpile totals 300000 
tons which would make it the largest in the world 
the soviets say the united states has a 50000ton stockpile 
20000 tons higher than western estimates 
the united states renewed production of binary weapons 
separate agents that are lethal only when combined ended an 
18year moratorium on making the arms

a woman who apparently set up 
housekeeping in david lettermans house while the tv talk show host 
was out of town was arrested in new jersey driving his sports car 
authorities said 
mary ray 36 of no known address was arrested sunday night 
when she stopped at the lincoln tunnel as she was driving into new 
york from new jesey 
she didnt have the 3 toll and told the toll collector she was 
lettermans wife said armando arrastia a spokesman for the port 
authority of new york and new jersey 
a 3yearold boy was a passenger in the car arrastia said 
ms ray gave authorities permission to go through the glove 
compartment of the blue 1988 porsche carrera where they found 
registration showing the car belongs to letterman he said 
authorities got in touch with letterman himself who said the 
woman is not his wife and didnt have permission to drive his 
car said arrastia he said he was unsure whether letterman knew 
the woman 
the host of nbcs late night with david letterman 
immediately reported the car stolen to the new canaan police 
department and ms ray was charged with receiving stolen property 
arrastia said 
she gave no indication as to where she was from or what she 
was doing in the area arrastia said 
ms ray was released into the custody of the hudson county 
prosecutors office in jersey city nj 
hudson county first assistant prosecutor frank destefano said 
thursday the woman was arraigned monday in superior court and bail 
was set at 5000 with a 500 cash option as far as i know its 
been posted he said 
there was no answer at the county jail thursday night and 
efforts to determine how the woman made bail were unsuccessful 
destefano said she is due to appear on the charge against her in 
weehawken municipal court on may 31 
arrastia said the woman intially told the police officer that 
her name was jane doe she said she is also known as mary ray 
she also indicated to our police that she is nondomiciled 
arrastia said i guess that means homeless in her context 
arrastia also did not know what relation if any she has to the 
child 
the boy was placed in the custody of the new jersey division of 
youth and family services arrastia said a spokeswoman for dyfs 
could not be reached for comment immediately there was no answer 
at her office or at her home 
new canaan police went to lettermans home and found that it had 
been entered said capt michael angelastro 
he said there appeared to be some validity to a report in 
thursdays editions of the new york daily news that the woman had 
moved into lettermans house with the child 
it appears that someone has been living in the house for the 
last couple of days he said adding the some plants and a rug 
appeared to have been moved 
but were not saying it was her angelastro said because 
letterman declined to press charges we are not pursuing it he 
said 
letterman did not immediately return a telephone call to his nbc 
offices seeking comment

nato formally asked italy thursday to 
be the host country for a us jet fighter wing that spain is 
expelling from its territory 
but the allies quarreled over how to pay for the move officials 
said 
italy was expected to accept the 72 nuclearcapable f16 jets if 
the allies paid to expand gioia del colle a small air base in 
southeastern italy that could be the planes new home 
a us official in brussels said a final decision on the italian 
site would be made later he also said details on financing the 
move would be put off 
in rome a senior italian official said italy agreed in 
principle to accept the f16s but the government and parliament 
must still examine the proposal 
the issue dominated the opening session of a twoday meeting of 
defense ministers from all north atlantic treaty organization 
members except france which is not part of natos joint military 
structure 
the defense chiefs also planned to issue on friday a joint 
statement of support for president reagan prior to his meetings 
next week in moscow with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said 
the officials 
all the officials spoke on condition they not be identified 
alliance officials portrayed the decision to ask italy to accept 
the jets as an important display of europes resolve to bear its 
share of the nato defense burden 
this is an important step toward preserving natos common 
defense and to sharing the burdens of doing so equitably among the 
alliance as a whole said lord carrington the nato 
secretarygeneral 
all agreed that this is an alliance matter and that the 
alliance should help finance it said gen wolfgang altenburg of 
west germany the alliances chief military adviser 
spain declared in january that the f16s would have to leave 
spanish territory within three years as part of a domestically 
popular drive to lessen the us military presence in spain 
the planes play an important role in natos strategy for 
carrying out a nuclear response to a possible attack by the 
sovietled warsaw pact 
altenburg told reporters that natos military committee the 
alliances highest military authority advised the defense 
ministers meeting that italy was the only suitable country to 
take the aircraft which are dedicated to the defense of southern 
europe 
italy has indicated it would be willing to have the f16s based 
on its soil as long as a formal nato request was made and the 
alliance paid for moving the planes and the 4000 us personnel 
and their dependents 
the nato defense ministers agreed in principle that the cost of 
relocating the us jet fighters should be met by natos 
infrastructure budget which is a common pool of money used to 
build military facilities 
there was disagreement however over whether the amount needed 
for the move estimated by us officials at roughly 500 million 
should be added to the infrastructure budget the american view 
was that 100 percent of the cost should be added to the budget 
others said no additional money should be made available according 
to several officials 
it appeared that the financing details would be left unresolved 
for the time being the planes arent scheduled to be moved until 
1991 
defense secretary frank c carlucci told his nato colleagues 
that a decision to keep the f16s in europe would help blunt us 
congressional complaints that the european allies are not pulling 
their weight in the alliance said an official who was present at 
the ministers meeting 
the ministers were expected on friday to publicly call for an 
alliance study of how common defense costs and responsibilities are 
shared

nicaraguan rebels on thursday offered 
a plan to lay down their arms but set conditions the government 
termed provoking preposterous and contrary to earlier accords 
the ussupported rebels known as contras tied their proposal 
to stop pursuing the 6yearold war to measures aimed at what they 
called democratization of nicaragua 
the rebels speaking at the opening of a new round of peace 
talks demanded within five days freedom of the press and broadcast 
media an end to the military draft and freedom to supply their 
forces in the field 
manuel espinoza the presidential spokesman quickly described 
the plan as preposterous and said the contra proposal is 
unrealistic and casts aside all that has been done and agreed upon 
until now and makes new proposals 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said with this 
proposal theyre acting as if they had won the war and the 
sandinistas had surrendered 
alfredo cesar chief of the rebel delegation said thursday the 
offer contains democratic changes the country should make at the 
end of the war 
tinoco said the leftist sandinista government was proposing 
discussion of guarantees in the electoral process dates for 
municipal elections reforms in the electoral law pluralistic 
representation in the electoral council and guarantees and norms 
for the functioning of a mixed economy 
rebel leaders said their plan deals with both military and 
political issues 
at the center of the contra proposal was a demand that the 
sandinistas ease their control over the army and government they 
also seek constitutional reforms and freedom of expression 
under what the rebels call a flexible timetable they would 
lay down their arms sometime before christmas 
we have come here to present a comprehensive proposal to the 
government for a global solution to the war cesar said late 
wednesday 
he leads delegates of the nicaraguan resistance umbrella 
organization for the rebels 
cesar said the rebels were prepared to make a special effort 
to achieve a definitive ceasefire 
the delegations met under tight security at the camino real 
hotel gen humberto ortega the defense minister and the brother 
of president daniel ortega heads the government delegation 
rebel representatives include their military leader col 
enrique bermudez who was making his first trip to managua since 
the war started in late 1981 
roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo and joao baena 
soares secretarygeneral of the organization of american states 
were witnesses 
cesar said rebels are not optimistic about the outcome of 
the meeting because they said the government has not complied with 
a preliminary peace plan agreed upon march 23 in sapoa a southern 
border town 
at sapoa the two sides agreed to a 60day ceasefire and on the 
basis for further talks to arrange a permanent truce 
the ceasefire expires may 30 but president ortega said he 
would extend it for an additional 30 days 
rebel leaders have said they want a permanent truce but will not 
break ortegas unilateral extension of the peace 
the meeting was the third between rebel and government 
representatives in managua since the sapoa accord 
ortega says the war has killed 26500 people and caused 3 
billion in damage to the economy

the head of the alabama naacp accused 
of taking 10000 to use his influence as a lawmaker to help a 
murderer get early parole appeared before a county grand jury 
thursday one day after he was indicted on federal extortion 
charges 
a federal grand jury is scheduled june 14 to hear the bribery 
charges against thomas reed the longtime state president of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 
federal investigators said their investigation is aimed solely 
at reed whos also a state representative montgomery county 
district attorney jimmy evans said the county grand jury is looking 
into the problem of preferential treatment of prisoners by state 
parole officials 
several officials of the state board of pardons and paroles also 
appeared before the grand jury thursday 
id say for the last four or five years weve had a nagging 
question in this state can you buy early release or early 
parole evans said were interested in knowing how widespread 
the practice is 
evans said the grand jury would probably return friday for a 
short session he did not say when he expected the investigation to 
finish 
reed cochairman of the legislatures joint prison committee 
is accused of taking 10000 from the uncle of anthony chesser and 
agreeing to use his influence as a legislator to try to get 
chessers early release from prison 
the fbis investigation surfaced last week with reed 
complaining it was in retaliation for his efforts to remove the 
confederate battle flag from the alabama capitol dome reed a 
businessman in 1970 became one of the first two blacks elected to 
the alabama legislature this century 
the fbi said reed got the state parole board to move up 
chessers parole consideration date from 1994 to 1989 chesser 
convicted of murdering his wife began serving a 40year sentence 
in august 1984 but then reeds efforts were reversed and the 
uncle demanded a refund 
reed repaid 8000 and promised to refund the rest the fbi said 
the meeting between the uncle and reed was taped with the 
uncles cooperation the fbi said you could hear the money being 
counted said us attorney jim wilson 
reeds central alabama district does not include anthony 
chessers hometown of phenix city and his uncle bobby gene 
chesser is from columbus ga the two legislators who represent 
phenix city rep charles adams and sen danny corbett said 
neither reed nor bobby gene chesser contacted them about getting an 
early parole for the convicted murderer 
the fbis investigation of reed 60 surfaced last week with 
reed complaining the probe was in retaliation for his efforts to 
remove the confederate flag from the alabama capitol dome 
reed drew widespread attention feb 2 when he made a symbolic 
bid to remove the flag from the capitol reed and 13 other black 
legislators were arrested and charged with misdemeanor trespassing 
in a case that is pending 
the fbi has denied any connection between the flag controversy 
and the case against reed

vice president george bush on thursday proposed an international 
strike force to hit quick and hard and often at foreign drug 
operations democrat michael dukakis campaigned in california while 
more than 100 million state tax increases neared his governors 
desk back in massachusetts 
bush the allbutsure republican presidential nominee also 
called for denying federal contracts to us companies lacking 
drugfree programs a proposal an aide said could involve 
mandatory drug testing 
dukakis however made fun of bushs recent drug proposals 
the question is why havent these been done the past seven 
years isnt the vice president in charge of this antidrug 
effort 
democrats dukakis and jesse jackson were concentrating on 
california the biggest delegate prize in the june 7 presidential 
primary finale while bush campaigned in new jersey on the way to 
his maine seacoast retreat 
for dukakis who has campaigned as a taxcutting governor the 
prospect of being saddled with an electionyear tax increase loomed 
as he sought votes 3000 miles away 
his state legislature gave approval to increases in cigarette 
and other taxes totaling more than 100 million as a remedy for 
newly found budget deficits a final vote was needed but the 
legislation cleared its major hurdle over republican objections 
dukakis declined to say whether he would sign the cigarette tax 
increase 
with dukakis leading bush in recent polls the vice presidents 
pollster robert teeter said the bush campaign is concerned but not 
panicstricken 
youd rather be ahead but surely there is no feeling of 
crisis or panic teeter said were a long way ahead of the 
election a lot of decisionmaking is yet to come 
an abcwashington post poll gave dukakis a 53 percent to 40 
percent lead over bush abc reported thursday night the survey 
based on telephone interviews with 1508 people between may 19 and 
monday had a margin of error of 3 percentage points 
bush plans to take a week off for meetings with party leaders 
and advisers in kennebunkport maine 
he launched a new antidrug initiative on thursday including 
the call for a drug strike force possibly under the auspices of 
the united nations to be created to hit back quick and hard and 
often at foreign drug operations us involvement would be 
coordinated by a military officer reporting to bushs vice 
president 
bush spoke in secaucus nj then visited a drug rehabilitation 
center in nearby newark where he talked with patients 
he said he opposed relaxing the justice departments zero 
tolerance policy for seizing yachts and other vehicles in which 
drugs are found i think it makes great sense he said 
with his own aides acknowledging the vice president has been 
hurt by the controversy over attorney general edwin meese iii bush 
sought to turn the attention to the democrats by renewing his call 
for a federal special prosecutor to investigate house speaker jim 
wrights finances 
i wonder if mike dukakis and jesse jackson will join me in 
calling for the house of representatives to appoint a special 
prosecutor to look into its own troubles starting with the 
speaker bush said 
dukakis visited a companysponsored day care center in palo 
alto calif where he called for more investment in schools and 
clear guidelines to limit corporate mergers 
today as in 1960 were fighting for the economic future of 
america dukakis said and now as then old ways simply will 
not do 
dukakis offered no defense of wright except to say it was 
proper and appropriate that the speaker had pledged cooperation 
with any ethics committee probe into his activities dukakis said 
bush should not try to exploit the wright issue and referred again 
to administration dealings with panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
im going to continue to insist on a full explanation from the 
administration about whats going on with noriega he said 
jackson also made california campaign appearances a day after 
he and dukakis debated in san francisco he said dukakis has 
followed his lead on south africa and in making drugs an issue 
he is adjusting to a new agenda jackson said in san jose 
the two men met privately after the debate an hourlong session 
in which they aimed their strongest words at the reagan 
administration for dealings with noriega 
jackson who released a fiveyear budget blueprint this week 
did urge dukakis to spell out his spending plans 
the governor is laying out a budget of promises but not a 
budget of numbers jackson said 
dukakis replied that his experience as governor taught him it 
was a serious mistake to lay out a detailed budget plan so far 
in advance because the revenue picture can change drastically 
the dukakis campaign meanwhile announced the appointment of 
dayton duncan as national press secretary he was deputy national 
press secretary in walter mondales 1984 campaign

us officials on thursday strongly defended 
restrictions against japan becoming a global military power as 
trade and foreign aid spending transform it into a political and 
economic superpower 
foreign aid is a natural area for japan to contribute to global 
stability given japans policy which we fully support not to 
play a global military role said deputy defense secretary 
william howard taft iv 
japan will surpass the united states as the worlds leading aid 
donor this year and it can still afford a further dramatic 
increase in aid taft added 
tafts statement was distributed to the senate defense 
appropriations subcommittee his position was echoed in testimony 
by other pentagon officials and the state department at a hearing 
on the defense burden shared by the united states and its northeast 
asian allies japan and south korea 
assistant defense secretary richard l armitage reminded 
senators that after the defeat of japan in world war ii the 
united states played a major and direct role in framing the 
constitution that continues to bar japan from maintaining offensive 
military force 
asian neighbors occupied by japan during the war and the 
japanese people themselves dont want to see rising sun flags on 
strategic bombers carrier battle groups or other power projection 
systems nor do we armitage added 
he said japan obviously could afford to spend more on 
selfdefense and will do so but in terms of military roles and 
missions japan is correctly oriented already 
meanwhile japan should substantially increase unrestricted aid 
grants to poorer countries in addition to boosting existing support 
for the upkeep of 55000 american military personnel in japan he 
said 
other countries in the region accept a defenseoriented military 
buildup by japan but they remain sensitive about any indication 
that japan might develop offensive capabilities or seek a regional 
security role said gaston sigur assistant secretary of state 
for east asian and pacific affairs 
japan has doubled its foreign aid several times since 1980 and 
in the coming year will pass the united states as the worlds 
leading aid donor taft said

the state law that bans exit polling within 
200 feet of the voting place is an unconstitutional infringement on 
the right to free speech a lawyer for the nbc television network 
argued thursday 
floyd abrams a new york city attorney specializing in 
mediarelated cases cited a 9th us circuit court of appeals 
decision striking down a similar law in washington state earlier 
this year 
nbc in arguments before us district judge charles lovell is 
trying to have the 1985 law lifted for the states june 7 primary 
election lovell took the arguments under advisement no decision 
is expected until next week 
exit polls ask people after theyve cast their ballots for whom 
they voted and are used by news organizations to project the 
winners of elections the state contends its ban protects voters 
privacy and voting decorum 
patricia schaeffer an assistant attorney general representing 
montana said the law was designed to balance the interests of the 
media in reporting on elections and the right of voters to order 
and dignity at the polls 
some legislators felt voters and been harassed and intimidated 
by people conducting exit polls in the past she said 
abrams contended that the law was enacted out of frustration 
over election night projections that declare winners before voting 
ends and maintains the statute denies the network its first 
amendment rights 
he said other state laws already protect the decorum of the 
voting place and can be used if troubles arise with pollsters he 
said 
asking people how they voted after they cast their ballots 
cannot be said to be an intrusion upon privacy abrams said 
a voter has the right to say i dont want to talk to you he 
said 
the 9th circuit ruled that exit polling is a form of speech 
protected by the first amendment it said the washington law which 
prohibited exit polling within 300 feet of a voting place violated 
the constitution and was not the least restrictive means of 
guaranteeing decorum at the polls

federal regulators want a photograph of a 
deformed infant on the warning label of accutane a powerful 
antiacne medicine that can damage the fetuses of pregnant women a 
pharmaceutical company said thursday 
that and other us food and drug administration requirements 
which are not written in concrete an fda spokesman said 
follow an fda panels recommendation last month that the drug 
remain on the market 
hoffmanla roche inc spokeswoman carolyn r glynn said the 
company is in agreement with the fdas order which does not 
stray much from the advisory panels recommendations on the 
prescription drug which was introduced in 1982 
the company agrees that female patients should be shown the 
infant deformities accutane can cause but the photo may be more 
appropriate to use on the patient consent materials signed in 
the doctors office she said 
those materials planned for issue early this summer would 
include a form to be signed by female patients stating they 
understand the risks associated with the drug she said 
ms glynn said company officials previously discussed using such 
a photograph but not with the fda or the advisory panel its 
not an issue of using the picture its where you use the 
picture she said 
the spokeswoman for the nutleybased company said 
hoffmanlaroche received the fdas requirements in a letter dated 
may 19 on wednesday she released the order thursday afternoon 
the fda left it to hoffmanla roche to release the order or keep 
it confidential she said 
but until we have the opportunity to review the letter were 
not in a position to say well yes we agree with this or no we 
dont agree with that she said 
fda spokesman william grigg said that theres still some 
negotiating room if the company wants to alter some of the 
requirements from the fda 
the agency and the company are trying to emphasize that these 
are not just minor birth defects that occur rarely but that if a 
woman does become pregnant the chances are very very high that 
she will have a very grossly debilitated infant that probably cant 
take care of itself as it grows up grigg said 
the advisory panel and the fda embraced a proposal by roche to 
sell accutane only in a socalled blister package in which explicit 
patient warnings including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a 
red x drawn through it would be sealed in at the factory to make 
sure the patient would see them 
everybody agrees that we have to minimize birth defects if the 
drug is going to remain on the market grigg said 
ms glynn said the company which must respond to the fdas 
letter within 15 days hopes to have the patient consent kit on the 
market by late june and have the new blister packaging in drug 
stores no later than september 
since its introduction in 1982 accutane has carried specific 
and explicit warnings that there is a high risk it will cause birth 
defects if taken during pregnancy 
those warnings have been strengthened in recent years but the 
fda grew concerned that too many women and perhaps doctors were 
ignoring them 
the advisory panel that convened in april concluded the benefits 
of the drug the only one on the market that can cure the severe 
scarring type of acne it is intended to treat outweighed the risk 
of misuse 
the fda has received reports of 66 birth defects associated with 
the drug since 1982 fortyfive of the defects were in the first 
two years of the drugs use when warnings were less severe there 
have been 21 reports since 1985 when labelling cautions were 
strengthened

the senate heading toward presummit approval 
of the historic treaty banning mediumrange nuclear missiles voted 
overwhelmingly thursday to restrict a future presidents power to 
change the treatys interpretation but delayed a final vote on the 
treaty until at least friday 
the 7227 decision settled the last major issue before floor 
action on the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the senate later killed 5345 a republicanbacked amendment 
which would essentially have reversed the earlier decision and 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva angered that the 
senate had spent time revisiting the same issue abandoned efforts 
to finish action on the pact thursday evening 
if were going to continue to have mickey mouse amendments 
like this the president is not going to have his treaty before he 
leaves the summit byrd told the senate shortly before it quit 
for the evening 
byrd was angry because he said he felt the treaty interpretation 
issue had been settled by the earlier amendment adopted by the 
7227 margin byrd and other democratic leaders had made victory on 
the issue one of their major goals in the debate over the treaty 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan agreed with byrd that 
work on the treaty is likely to be finished friday 
the inf treaty signed dec 8 by reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev at their washington summit requires 
elimination within three years of us and soviet nuclear missiles 
with a range of 300 miles to 3400 miles it would result in the 
elimination of 867 us missiles in europe and elimination of 1752 
soviet missiles 
ratification is assured because it only requires 67 votes and 90 
or more of the 100 senators are likely to vote for the pact 
according to byrd and other senators 
approval would mean the treaty could be rushed to moscow before 
reagan and gorbachev meet sunday at the summit white house chief 
of staff howard baker was standing by to carry the ratification 
papers to reagan 
the pact will be the first ratified by the senate since the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty also it will be the first treaty to 
actually require the destruction of weapons rather than simply 
slowing the buildup and its farreaching verification provisions 
include the first onsite inspections allowed by either superpower 
the senate voted 960 approval thursday of an amendment which 
incorporates into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago by 
secretary of state george shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze dealing with weapons using futuristic technology 
and clarifying onsite verification rules 
the senate has been working on the pact since last week and the 
last major hurdle was cleared wednesday when helms the chief 
critic dropped his opposition 
byrd had scheduled a vote thursday to halt the delaying tactics 
used by helms and other gop conservatives but that vote was set 
aside when offstage negotiations reached the agreement permitting 
the final vote 
the main unresolved issue didnt affect the inf treaty but it 
involved a longrunning fight between the white house and the 
democraticcontrolled congress over the issue involving the 
constitutional authority to interpret treaties 
the amendment approved thursday requires senate approval if any 
future president tries to reinterpret the treaty 
the fight arose from reagans assertion that he has the legal 
authority to unilaterally reinterpret the antiballistic missile 
treaty to permit expanded tests of his star wars antimissile 
defense 
congressional democrats have disputed that claim and argue that 
their amendment to the inf pact is an attempt to preserve the 
senates constitutional power to advise and consent on treaties 
but critics say the amendment would unfairly restrict a president 
byrd told his colleagues thursday that accepting the 
administrations claim to having unilateral power to reinterpret 
treaties would reduce the constitutional role of the senate to a 
mere nullity the consent of the senate would be reduced to a 
clerical function 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
agreed with byrd saying we would be illserved by that kind of 
process and our foreign policy would be damaged severely 
but sen arlen specter rpa said the amendment holds a 
switchblade knife at the united states because it imposed a 
standard on the united states not imposed on the soviet union 
sen pete wilson rcalif called the amendment palpably 
ridiculous a dereliction of duty and said it would put the 
senate on record as asserting authority he contended it did not 
possess under the constitution 
ratification would cap an 11year fight which began with the 
1977 deployment by the soviet union of ss20 missiles a 
triplewarhead weapon which was used to replace the soviets older 
ss4 and ss5 missiles 
the first major alarm was raised in october 1977 when helmut 
schmidt then chancellor of west germany warned in a london speech 
that the ss20s were a serious threat to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
in response nato began discussing deployment of new 
atomictipped weapons those discussions culminated in the dec 13 
1979 decision by nato to adopt what became known as the 
twotrack decision that involved the dual decision to both 
pursue arms negotiations at the same time new us atomic weapons 
were being installed 
nato decided that four years later beginning in late 1983 it 
would deploy 572 new us atomic weapons including 108 pershing 
iis which would be stationed in west germany and another 464 
groundlaunched cruise missiles for deployment in britain italy 
west germany belgium and the netherlands 
late in 1981 reagan announced that his administration was 
adopting the socalled zero option as its position in the inf 
talks the us plan which originated with west german 
politicians called for halting the planned us deployments if the 
soviets withdrew their ss20s administration critics said the us 
plan was unrealistic 
in 1982 paul nitze the top us negotiator and his soviet 
counterpart yuli kvitsinsky agreed privately on a formula for a 
proposed inf agreement it became known as the walk in the 
woods but it was rejected by both the us and soviet 
governments 
the nato deployments started in november 1983 in west germany 
and the soviets responded by walking out of the inf talks 
the negotiations resumed in the spring of 1985 after gorbachev 
took over power

president kenneth kaunda accused 
western governments thursday of not doing enough to fight apartheid 
as he opened the annual summit of the organization of african unity 
inside south africa the racist regime has made efforts to 
intensify its acts of oppression he told 30 african heads of 
state attending the summit which marked the organizations 25th 
anniversary many people are still being killed maimed or 
imprisoned 
how is it possible for major western countries to claim that 
they must deal with the racist regime because sanctions dont 
work he asked pausing to wipe tears from his eyes 
am i to conclude that the reason they acted against hitler is 
that those who died were white people said kaunda the outgoing 
oau chairman if so what conclusion am i going to make that they 
are not prepared to act against the new hitler president pw 
botha in south africa 
he said africas struggle had never been and will never be 
antiwhite it will always be antiapartheid 
us secretary of state george shultz said in a message to the 
oau that the united states abhors the ugly system of apartheid 
and is commited to helping south africa become a democratic society 
shultz said he would have attended the meeting but the date 
conflicted with this weeks superpower summit kenneth brown a 
deputy assistant secretary of state for african affairs went 
instead 
kaunda thanked the us congress for imposing limited sanctions 
on pretoria and expressed gratitude to american church leaders and 
students for supporting antiapartheid efforts 
he also thanked people in britain west germany and france who 
against their governments are supporting our cause and the 
nordic countries 
the oau has frequently denounced south africa and demanded that 
western governments impose mandatory sanctions against the 
whiteled government at the same time black africa does about 1 
billion a year in business with south africa much of it covertly 
malis president gen moussa traore was elected thursday to 
succeed kaunda in the chairman post which switches every year 
between representatives of northern and subsaharan africa 
traore urged the oau to further improve our methods of 
struggle so as to fully dismantle apartheid and increase moral and 
material support to the peoples of south africa namibia and the 
frontline states 
traore said oau efforts to end the libyachad dispute were 
clear evidence of the ability of africa to transcend its 
differences 
kaunda mediated a ceasefire between the north african nations 
in september on wednesday libyan leader moammar gadhafi told 
reporters in tripoli that he had declared an end to the 15yearold 
war in honor of the oaus 25th anniversary 
president hissene habre of chad attending the summit expressed 
cautious optimism about gadhafis overture 
traore also praised ethiopian leader mengistu haile mariam and 
somalias president mohamed siad barre for their resumption of 
diplomatic ties last month after an 11year break prompted by their 
desert war 
by law and custom in south africa apartheid establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the countrys 26 million 
blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million whites

south africa and mozambique agreed 
wednesday to resume security meetings that lapsed three years ago 
when relations between the two countries deteriorated 
a meeting between the two countries on wednesday included 
ranking diplomats and military officials and was the latest 
indication that hostilities were easing 
the two sides said in a statement that they would resume 
meetings of a joint security commission at the earliest possible 
date the commission was set up in line with the 1984 nkomati 
accord a mutual nonaggression treaty in which each country 
pledged to halt support for guerrillas fighting against the other 
government 
the commission has been defunct since 1985 when mozambique 
found documents indicating that south africa was still aiding 
mozambican rebels despite the treaty 
since then mozambique has persistently accused south africa of 
continued covert aid to the mozambique national resistance rebel 
movement south africa denies it 
the war has devastated mozambiques economy and is the main 
cause of a famine that has left almost 6 million of the countrys 
145 million people in need of food aid 
the two delegations affirmed the commitments of their 
respective governments not to support the commission of violence 
against the peoples of their respective countries the statement 
said 
the army commander lt gen tobais dai led mozambiques 
delegation at wednesdays talks south africas delegation was 
headed by the directorgeneral of the foreign affairs department

a british minister on wednesday said it 
was unlikely that a multinational un force would be created to 
escort commercial vessels through the persian gulf 
at a news conference ian stewart minister of state for the 
armed forces praised cooperation among western naval task forces 
in the waterway where iran and iraq are at war 
but when asked about the chances of implementing a soviet 
proposal for the creation of a unsponsored force to replace the 
individual contingents in the gulf he said we dont see it as 
an immediate possibility at all 
the united states the soviet union britain france italy 
belgium and the netherlands have forces in the gulf to protect 
ships bearing their national flags and to destroy mines 
it sounds attractive in theory but it would be very difficult 
to put together in practical terms stewart said there has 
never been a un naval task force of that kind and certainly not 
when two parties are still actively at war 
stewart met earlier wednesday with crown prince sheik hamad bin 
isa alkhalifa commander of the bahrain defense force 
the british minister said countries in the region have been 
very helpful in efforts to limit the effects of the 7yearold 
war on shipping lanes of the oilrich region 
stewart said there have been less hostilities and less 
activities at sea than would probably have been the case before 
the foreign navies sent forces to the gulf 
iran attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for iraqi raids on 
its shipping lanes iran also has been blamed for sowing mines in 
the waterway 
earlier this month washington expanded the duties of its naval 
task force allowing the warships to intervene in attacks on 
neutral vessels even if they were not flying american flags 
steward welcomed the us decision but would not say if britain 
will follow suit 
so far iran has not attacked vessels under any military escort 
one of the british warships the frigate hms beaver is on a 
port call in bahrain stewart was scheduled to inspect it and to 
visit other gulf countries

mathias rust the west german aviator who a year 
ago slipped across one of the worlds most secure borders and 
landed a plane at red square remains jailed at lefortovo prison 
with hopes fading for an early release 
the dramatic may 28 1987 flight shook the foundation of soviet 
security and oiled the way for the ouster of defense minister 
sergei l sokolov and air defense chief alexander koldunov but 
soviet citizens still grin at the audacity of the young pilot and 
his success in putting one over on the kremlin 
soviet jets scrambled when rust crossed into restricted airspace 
over the republic of estonia but the soviet air defense forces 
took no action to halt the flight the singleengine cessna buzzed 
such kremlin landmarks as lenins tomb and spassky tower before 
landing 
rust now 20 was sentenced sept 4 to four years at a 
generalregime labor camp on charges of malicious mischief he is 
serving his time at the infamous lefortovo prison in eastern 
moscow which in the past contained american journalist nicholas 
daniloff and u2 pilot francis gary powers

moscow ap raisa maximovna gorbachev who charms the western 
press on her trips abroad is given far less attention on her own 
turf by a soviet media that plays down the high profile of its 
first lady 
the poised tastefully dressed and alternately demure and 
gregarious wife of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has made 
several public appearances in the last few months 
she attended may day celebrations where she stood at the edge 
of red square chatting with her daughter irina a physician in her 
30s and with wives of other party and state dignitaries 
earlier this month she attended a moscow performance of the 
dance theater of harlem within the last few months she has been 
shown briefly on vremya the statecontrolled television stations 
evening newscast viewing western art exhibits 
but the auburnhaired mrs gorbachev is seldom seen in shouted 
exchanges similar to those between nancy reagan and the white house 
press corps 
although mrs gorbachev generally seems amenable to questions 
from the foreign press similar chats rarely occur with soviet 
reporters who have no tradition of reporting on their first lady 
in yugoslavia earlier this year when american reporters wanted 
to talk with her she sought out a yugoslavian journalist and told 
him to ask a question before she would respond to others 
like gorbachev himself the soviet first lady has become 
somewhat controversial 
the soviet people do not believe that wives should influence a 
leader politically said a 34yearold teacher they are not 
used to it and they ask why should she influence affairs of our 
country 
mrs gorbachev appears to serve as an unofficial adviser to her 
husband in a manner similar to former first lady rosalynn carter 
but the extent to which she discusses policy with her husband is 
unknown among the soviet people 
when soviet television broadcast gorbachevs interview with nbc 
anchorman tom brokaw in early december it censored the soviet 
leaders comment that he discusses everything including soviet 
affairs at the highest level with his wife 
the reference to mrs gorbachevs role as unofficial adviser to 
her husband was the only portion of the interview not broadcast to 
viewers indicating just how sensitive her high profile has become 
foreign dignitaries who have met the 56yearold mrs gorbachev 
describe her as wellinformed on international and domestic 
affairs but her knowledge of political affairs is not flawless as 
revealed during her washington visit in early december for the 
superpower summit 
when talking with a group of armenians who had emigrated to 
america mrs gorbachev told them the soviet union has always had a 
good relationship with armenia armenia is one of 15 soviet 
republics and therefore its people are soviet citizens 
mrs gorbachev is frequently seen at her husbands side when he 
travels around the soviet union and she has accompanied him on all 
of his trips abroad 
mrs gorbachev has been active in promoting an exchange of 
fashion and design ideas with western firms and holds an official 
position as a member of the soviet cultural fund 
her wardrobe is smart and varied and has been supplemented by 
gifts from paris couturiers during the couples official visit to 
france in 1985 she is seldom seen in the same outfit twice when 
the average soviet woman usually has no more than three or four 
changes of clothes to wear to work 
last year on a visit to prague she was shown leaving moscow 
wearing a fur hat and coat but soviet television also ran pictures 
of the gorbachevs arrival revealing that mrs gorbachev had 
changed in flight into a cloche cap and wool coat 
raisa maximovna titorenko was born on jan 5 1932 she and 
gorbachev met at the boarding house where both lived as students at 
moscow state university she studied sociology while he studied 
law they moved to gorbachevs home region of stavropol in southern 
russia when he graduated in 1955 
mrs gorbachev took a job as lecturer at her alma mater when her 
husband by then a rising party official returned to moscow she 
gave up her job when gorbachev became communist party chief 
the gorbachevs have one daughter and two granddaughters

in the climate of uncertainty that has prevailed 
since the stock market crash last fall many savers and investors 
have opted for the safe harbor of money market mutual funds 
it is easy to think of money funds as a kind of generic 
onesizefitsall product since all of them do pretty much the 
same thing investing in shortterm interestbearing securities 
for a respectable yield with safety and liquidity 
their net asset values are kept constant leaving no price 
performance comparisons to differentiate among them 
thus many people dont devote great amounts of time and energy 
to choosing a particular fund but rather go with whichever one is 
handiest commonly at a brokerage firm or mutual fund group with 
which they already have dealings 
convenience is indeed an important consideration in picking a 
money fund and most financial advisers agree that money funds as a 
group are very safe investments even though they lack the federal 
insurance that banks and savings institutions can offer on deposits 
still students of the subject say there can be significant 
differences between funds that are worth heeding in order to 
maximize both your financial return and your peace of mind 
in a midmay tabulation of 322 funds that invest in taxable 
securities donoghues money fund report put their average annual 
yield based on the results of the most recent seven days and 
including the effects of compounding at 647 percent 
among the individual funds the yields ranged from 57 percent 
to 72 percent 
such a variance doesnt mean much to someone investing just 
1000 or 2000 with more substantial sums however it starts to 
add up 
why would one fund yield a good deal more than the other one 
common explanation lies in differing investment philosophies 
an aggressive fund management might stretch its yield by 
concentrating on securities considered a little more risky than 
treasury bills for example commercial paper issued by 
corporations with credit ratings a shade or two below the top 
a large number of more conservative funds confine themselves 
exclusively to us government securities that are guaranteed by 
the government against default sacrificing a bit in yield for the 
sake of an extra measure of safety 
in addition a fund can seek an enhanced yield by lengthening 
the maturity of the securities it owns in theory at least longer 
maturities should carry at least slightly higher yields because of 
the increased risk they represent 
among the funds tracked by the donoghue organization average 
maturities recently ranged from one to 81 days 
while such considerations tend to justify yield differences 
between funds says norman fosback editor of the advisory letter 
income amp safety they by no means account for all of those 
differences 
the majority of the yield differential is due to varying 
expense ratios he says 
fosback cited a recent donoghue survey that found highyielding 
funds running expenses that effectively lowered their return to 
investors by half a percentage point the lowestyielding funds by 
contrast had expenses to the tune of 12 percentage points 
thats just the opposite of the way things should ideally work 
a fund that costs more to operate should earn its keep by producing 
superior results 
the message as summarized by sheldon jacobs in his handbook for 
noload fund investors avoid high expense ratio funds a high 
expense ratio almost always means a lower net yield to you

americas marketplace has become so marked by 
irrational ups and downs especially for financial products such as 
stock and bonds that it has been said in jest that it should be 
institutionalized 
that of course is one of the problems trading by 
institutions not of the mental sort as suggested by the jest but 
mutual funds pension funds and the like have come to dominate the 
marketplace 
not only are they large but often they think and act alike 
producing a combination that can change the markets direction on 
what might otherwise seem to be insignificant news in a sense the 
market can trip over a pebble 
however institutions are probably but one of several reasons 
for the frenzies fads flipflops and phobias that seem to grip the 
market technology financial journalism economic uncertainty and 
internationalization also are factors 
that is the contention of economist john tuccillo who though 
his specialty is real estate he is national association of 
realtors senior vice president has produced one of the most 
cogent explanations of current market behavior 
in the past he states panics occurred infrequently from 1907 
to 1929 for example there was almost nothing to rate the 
designation now we see big changes in stocks interest rates 
currency values and more on a weekly basis 
in explanation he cites five factors 
big block trading stock and bond price indexes are weighted 
averages of daily trades and they are watched closely by mutual 
and pension funds and other big institutional players 
since institutions as opposed to individuals now dominate the 
market even slight changes in indexes can causes a great deal of 
weight to be thrown around simply because of the size of the 
trades 
computerization has given even more weight to the activities of 
these large traders most of whom use computers to signal the 
proper time to buy and sell 
the problem says tuccillo is that all the programs give off 
the same signals when the market moves technology will give 
it a further momentum turning what might have been small swings 
into avalanches 
with the proliferation of financial television shows and 
newspapers there has been increasing competition for stories 
so just as tv news has made stars of tinhorn felons and 
obscure rebellions tv financial news has made stars out of 
statistics and even ugh economists 
should traders care about the monthly trade numbers no says 
tuccillo monthly numbers are unreliable and the true picture is 
shown only annually do they care probably a lot why the 
financial media tell them to 
the result is a jittery market that hangs on the arithmetic of 
obscure bureaucrats 
the crash of october 1987 so shattered confidence that most 
players dont know what to believe 
hence they soar on a good numbers and crash on a bad one 
and it doesnt help that the media produce reams of instant 
analysis 
internationalization financial markets now trade around the 
clock what happens in tokyo and london affects markets in the 
united states and on again around the globe until cause and effect 
are obscured 
as the players increase in number the risk of strong 
movement increases 
tuccillos conclusion and advice 
the economy in 1988 although weaker than last year is 
growing in an atmosphere of steady interest rates and low 
inflation so when rates run up hold tight and ride out the 
fourto sixweek frenzy

when michael dukakis was 17 he borrowed 
his mothers new convertible on a school night and smashed one of 
the lights trying to negotiate his way out of a gas station 
true to his superstraight image the teenager went home and 
waited for hours for his mother and father to return home to tell 
them of the mishap 
he couldnt go to sleep he couldnt go to bed without first 
telling me recalls his mother 84yearold euterpe boukis 
dukakis 
there are no negatives in her assessment of the politician whose 
first bid for office ended in the presidency of his thirdgrade 
class 
when asked what her strongest criticism of her son would be she 
scolded a reporter thats a terrible thing to ask a mother 
she even insists that he is not as humorless as many people seem 
to think 
campaigning is serious business and he cannot be a 
jokester said mrs dukakis when we are together in 
gatherings with family friends parties hes just jovial 
mrs dukakis dressed in a blue sweater buttoned to the neck and 
a neatly pressed bluegreen plaid skirt sat straight in her arm 
chair during an interview and grudgingly held a high school 
photograph of her son at the request of a photographer 
that would be too sentimental she said of the pose 
many photos of her late husband panos and her sons family can 
be found in almost every room of her home in the living room a 
small teddybear with a miniature dukakis for president tshirt 
is seated on a rocking chair mother and son remain very close 
despite his exhausting schedule 
he calls his mother every other day he called me this morning 
to tell me what the plans are for the week mrs dukakis said 
we dont see each other as much as we used to but he never 
forgets 
the likely democratic nominee for president rarely fails to 
mention his immigrant parents in his campaign speeches 
panos his father came to america speaking little english when 
he was just 15 and worked in the mills to put himself through bates 
college in maine 
after only eight years in the country he went to harvard 
medical school and became a successful obstetrician he died in 
1979 
the candidates mother emigrated from larissa greece at age 9 
and worked with her family in the textile factories in haverhill 
in 1921 she became the first girl of about 3000 greeks from her 
hometown to go to college she graduated phi beta kappa from bates 
and taught english and history in ashland nh and amesbury 
schools 
michael is so proud of that fact mrs dukakis said 
despite her age mrs dukakis has made many campaign appearances 
on her sons behalf 
last december for example when dukakis was tied up with 
gubernatorial duties she went to new hampshire to officially 
register her son for the states firstinthenation primary 
i love it its very interesting this has been a wonderful 
opportunity for me to get to know the country she said 
asked point blank why her son should be president euterpe said 
his strength of character he will always obey the law which our 
present administration hasnt done at all theyve been conniving 
theyve been underhanded and michael would never do that 
she also said her sons family would set a good role model for 
the nation 
because we grew in an ethnic family we kept the old values of 
discipline of respect for older people of family closeness she 
said 
what a wonderful role model michael and kitty and the family 
a close family a loving family would be in contrast to what we 
have now she said 
euterpe said that family tradition includes a sense of duty and 
discipline 
when michael and his older brother stelian who struggled with 
mental problems and died after being struck by a car while riding 
his bike in 1973 were growing up they never received allowances 
for household chores like the other children in the neighborhood 
we are all members of the family we dont pay each other for 
what we do for each other said the governors mother

its been 16 years since liza minnellis had a 
special on network television and it took an unusual idea to get 
her onto the small screen for liza minnelli triple play on abc 
next tuesday 
they abc ask me every year this year i think we shocked 
them because we said yes it took me since 1972 to think of 
something different minnelli said recently on a shooting break 
the last special that was my own was in 1972 i was in 
baryshnikov on broadway and goldie and liza together not my 
own 
i got tired of in concert liza with a z was the first 
inconcert special then everybody else did them 
the onehour special will air next tuesday minnellis costars 
are john rubinstein louis gossett jr and ryan oneal 
the best thing about it is not having to perform alone 
minnelli said not going out there singing your songs and going 
home you get to the point where the joy is working with other 
people thats where the real kick is and the challenge too im 
working with people i admire and hadnt had a chance to work with 
before 
songwriter fred ebb had the idea that made minnelli say yes 
this time the same fourline dialogue to begin a short play was 
given to three sets of writers lanford wilson terrence mcnally 
with wendy wasserstein and ebb and his partner john kander 
wilson wrote a drama mcnally and wasserstein a romantic fantasy 
and kander and ebb a musical 
minnelli has worked with kander and ebb a lot and was in the 
1984 broadway musical the rink with book by mcnally 
we got the writers we wanted first crack out of the box 
she said we were really thrilled 
we didnt know what they were writing we hired the best and 
trusted them 
minnelli got british director piers haggard whom she hadnt 
worked with before but admired martin scorsese one day showed me 
two episodes of the original british tv version of pennies from 
heaven that piers directed it was brilliant she said when i 
went to london in 1983 i looked him up calling strangers is 
something im not wont to do but i was in such admiration of this 
man 
ive kept looking for things to do with him this is just 
perfect he has understood the different styles and made this work 
within our budget 
the scenes shot the day of the interview take place in a parlor 
complete with tiffany lamps standins walked through while 
minions with tape measures and light meters announced measurements 
to adjusters of light reflectors 
then minnelli and rubinstein rehearsed moving from chair to 
settee haggard had them repeat it slower minnelli asked that her 
chair cushion be higher and two blankets were folded under it she 
thanked the woman who handed her the highheeled shoes that she 
donned for the scenes three takes 
minnelli wont be watching her triple play as soon as 
shooting ended she and her husband mark gero left for a european 
vacation she has accepted an invitation from frank sinatra and 
sammy davis to replace dean martin in six weeks of concerts next 
fall 
meanwhile she said she needed the vacation because of the 
grueling schedule of the tv special 
we work from 6 in the morning to 8 at night then go home and 
faint but im healthy and enjoying it a lot of it is making sure 
when im working i get plenty of sleep 
theres a basic tension in the air she said i think the 
writers have done some really gutsy stuff that hasnt been seen 
its not just nice safe sitcom stuff it is about interesting 
things well see how it goes over i think were taking some 
chances some risks anytime you try to do that its a little 
anxious a little nervous

the oil that made the persian gulf rich 
now is fouling it 
environmental experts say oil pollution has never been worse 
and while they regard it as an indirect result of the 7yearold 
war between iraq and iran the actual source remains unknown 
nobody can do anything until the war is stopped because it is 
too difficult to find the sources of the leakage said jassim 
ahmed alqaseer acting director of fisheries in this island state 
iran however has reported what it called an unprececented 
oil slick in the stait of hormuz in the southern gulf and said it 
resulted from an iraqi air raid on the larak offshore oil terminal 
in the area 
the islamic republic news agency quoted an official of irans 
environment protection organization as saying thousands of fish 
have died and that the livelihood of local fishermen is endangered 
walt vreeland an american adviser to the bahrainbased 
environmental protection committee said the war restricts scouting 
of the gulf for signs of oil pollution 
were very limited as to how far we can go out said 
vreeland a native of bucks county pa bahrains territorial 
waters are 12 miles and to be quite honest about it im not going 
to go 50 miles in a helicopter no way 
vreeland said in an interview that bahrain which is about 
halfway up the 600milelong gulf is among the hardesthit areas 
at a time when it is trying to attract tourists to its beaches 
the main thing youll find are aesthetic problems people just 
dont want to go to the beach because its a mess down there 
vreeland added the other indirect effects would be reduction of 
fish of sea grass beds these are not areas you would expect to 
see immediate effects 
cleanup efforts already are under way on bahrains beaches but 
the oil remains in the water 
i could see tar and tarballs all around and when i saw the 
windsurfing boards they had all turned black from the tar said

oil pollution is not new to the gulf where wells on shore and 
underwater produce nearly a fifth of the industrial worlds 
petroleum in the past however the gulf could handle the 
occasional oil spill 
extremely shallow along the coasts and about 300 feet at its 
deepest the gulf is fed from the north by the tigris and euphrates 
rivers 
naturally cycled every two years the water flows out through 
the strait of hormuz a passage so narrow as to prevent a large 
volume of water exchange between the gulf and the arabian sea 
you have to realize were dealing with an oil spill of unknown 
source of unknown size of unknown duration said vreeland we 
dont know where its coming from we dont know how much is coming 
in its very widespread 
observers say more clumps of oil are floating in the southern 
gulf than at any time in the past year gulfbased shipping 
executives believe some is from three iranian oil platforms wrecked 
by the us navy in recent reprisal attacks vreeland says it isnt 
known if they are leaking oil 
another suspected source is irans big kharg island oil terminal 
in the northern gulf it has been attacked by iraqi planes several 
times but iran has never reported on damage 
alqaseer says pollution threatens a commercial fishing 
industry already affected by the war southflowing currents help 
to keep northern waters clean but fishermen are afraid to go 
there because of the fighting he said 
vreeland said that even after the disappearance of light 
fractions of the oil which are most toxic to marine life the 
heavy residue collects dirt and debris and sinks to the seabed 
affecting some sea life 
as scientists analyze oil samples in a search for the source 
public concern is growing gulfarea newspapers give wide coverage 
to the prpblem and environmental groups meet regularly 
its going to destroy the shoreline destroy some of the 
beaches some of the rocky shores vreeland said 
nor is the threat shortterm he said 
i foresee this happening again and again and until the 
iraqiran war stops until we can get surveillance out and actually 
watch whats going on theres nothing we can do about it

of the three countries taken by the communists 
in the indochina war laos has been the one least heard from a 
nation drawn in upon itself but an associated press correspondent 
who had been to laos during the war years and afterward on rare 
visits was allowed back for a 10day stay recently and found the 
government is changing its ways to a degree 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the communist leaders of remote laos are 
loosening their grip on the country in a local version of the 
kremlins sweeping reforms 
under the banner of the new economic mechanism ownership 
and inheritance of private property have been newly sanctioned a 
code encouraging investment from the capitalist world has been 
passed and plans are under way to cut by onethird a bureaucracy 
that controlled the lives of laos 39 million citizens 
although still a oneparty state wary of political dissidents 
and run by some of the worlds most durable revolutionaries laos 
may go farther in liberalizing its economy than neighboring vietnam 
and a number of other communist countries according to western 
diplomats stationed here 
people are beginning to smile again said one european who 
has known the country for decades 
while state cooperatives do exist bonuses and other incentives 
have been introduced and several purportedly socialist enterprises 
visited appeared to have the loosest kind of structure 
go see what we have in the cooperative store then come back 
and buy from me said a friendly old woman trying to sell 
handwoven cloth to visiting western journalists 
although still quiet and slowpaced by most measurements 
striking changes are apparent in vientiane the capital city of 
250000 
the tailors and jewelers along samsenthai the citys main 
commercial street are back in business as are the dance halls 
where women in sarongs and their partners alternate between 
traditional ramwong music and semihard rock 
unthinkable a few years ago laotian women now dance with 
foreigners at some clubs teenagers wear longish hair and western 
fashions which in the early days of communist rule was enough to 
have them branded as decadent hippies and sent off to 
reeducation camps 
at the citys sprawling central market us dollars thai baht 
and the local kip currency are all legally used to buy japanese 
television sets thaimade designer clothes european liquor 
and a wide variety of local farm produce the newly remodeled 
market is on lease for 10 years to thai businessmen who share 
profits with the government 
economically booming thailand next door is the source of most 
consumer goods which are traded or smuggled across the mekong 
river frontier local purchasing power is fueled by some 3 million 
to 5 million yearly sent home to relatives by refugees in the 
united states france and elsewhere 
business is getting better every day said virachit 
philaphandeth one of a growing number of enterpreneurs whose 
monthly 300000 kip 850 in net profit is about 50 times the wage 
of a middleranked government official 
virachit whose ventures include a lumber mill said growing 
confidence in the new economic mechanism is leading to more 
domestic investment and a miniboom in private homebuilding which 
is evident in vientiane and other areas of laos 
the new policies the diplomats agree have been influenced by 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachevs reforms in the soviet 
union as well as by reforms in neighboring china and vietnam and 
by television programs avidly watched here from robustly 
capitalist prowestern thailand 
the reforms are also apparent reactions to the period between 
the communist victory in 1975 and about 1980 when the regime 
attempted to collectivize peasants flirted with inappropriate 
industrial projects and attempted lifestyle changes antithetical to 
the basic laotian character and traditions 
the economy stagnated an estimated 350000 people including a 
bulk of vientianes skilled middle class fled the country and 
adherents of the toppled usbacked government were sent to harsh 
reeducation camps an insurgency flickered 
although laos did not suffer the postwar traumas of its 
indochinese neighbors cambodia and vietnam neither was the 
transition a song and dance revolution as some observers 
claimed 
there is no philosophy which must be followed from here to 
eternity a key economic planner somphavanh inthavong said in 
an interview he explained that slowly evolving reforms were 
formally approved at the communist partys fourth congress in 
december 1986 and have gained steady momentum over the past year 
whatever changes the economic loosening may bring to the 
political arena the lao peoples revolutionary party as the 
communist party is called currently shows few signs of relaxing 
its grip on power or dismantling a watchdog apparatus which 
penetrates to the grassroots 
the countrys first national elections since 1975 are scheduled 
for midnovember following balloting at district levels officials 
say there will be more candidates than the 79 seats in the supreme 
peoples assembly but all will be screened before being allowed to 
run 
the major tasks of this and next year will be to finish the 
draft of a constitution the first under comunist rule and to 
substitute a legal system for the decrees under which the country 
has been run since the end of the indochina war in 1975 
widely seen as the architect of change is kaysone phomvihan the 
68yearold leader who is one of the longest powerholders in the 
communist world he has headed the party since 1955 
although long regarded as a conservative kaysone has sharply 
criticized the systems shortcomings and opened some doors 
western diplomats say the bulk of reeducation camp inmates have 
been released laotians are being permitted to visit refugee 
relatives abroad and buddhism appears to be well tolerated 
although entry into laos is still difficult more western 
journalists have been allowed to visit the country in recent months 
laos is closely bound to vietnam and the soviet union but 
united nations statistics show that unlike a few years ago about 60 
percent of the 100 million that laos annually receives in economic 
aid is now coming from the noncommunist world notably japan 
sweden and australia 
souphavanh the economic planner said the main socioeconomic 
thrust will be to uplift the more than 3 million poor subsistance 
farmers including large numbers of ethnic minorities in the 
rugged countryside 
few roads penetrate the provinces electricity is rare and 
diseases rampant with the infant mortality rate at 120 to 130 per 
1000 births among the highest in the world 
officials indicate that a key measure of the new economic 
policys success will be its effectiveness in spreading the 
relative prosperity now being enjoyed in vientiane and the lowlands 
bordering thailand

nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev 
allied perhaps only in the desire to help their husbands succeed at 
the moscow summit are expected to suppress their muchtouted 
rivalry in the interest of a smooth session 
but gossiphungry summit watchers will be alert for any hint of 
a new round in the purported superpower catfight be it an archly 
raised eyebrow from mrs reagan or an extended lecture to the us 
press corps from mrs gorbachev 
the two women have scheduled their first gettogether for sunday 
afternoon as president reagan and soviet communist party general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev face off for the first time over a 
kremlin negotiating table 
soviet experts predict the two women will strive to put aside 
their differences and display goodwill at a summit that may prove 
to be more show than substance 
i suspect they both want to make sure that they dont get 
in the way and that they dont become part of the story in a 
negative sense said ed hewett a specialist in soviet studies 
and a senior analyst at the brookings institution in washington 
even though both women poohpoohed the idea that they engaged in 
any form of competition at last decembers summit former white 
house chief of staff donald regan offered a behindthescenes peek 
at their relationship in his book for the record 
regan writes that mrs reagan was peeved at the frontpage 
attention garnered by mrs gorbachevs outspoken and fashionable 
style during the first ussoviet summit in geneva in 1985 
irritated by mrs gorbachevs extensive conversation at their 
first dinner mrs reagan sniffed afterwards who does that dame 
think she is regan wrote 
the former chief of staff also disclosed mrs reagans 
predeliction for stargazing in his book a subject that mrs 
reagan so far has not addressed or been questioned about and one 
that could dominate her early encounters with the media here 
mrs reagan is described privately by associates and white house 
aides as determined to try to squelch reports of any renewed 
disputes with gorbachevs wife during this meeting 
mrs reagan has always been a gracious hostess and has always 
been a courteous guest said shiela tate mrs reagans former 
press secretary youll see that she will be this time too 
ms tate a public relations executive with hill amp knowlton 
said the first lady has always seen her role as an extension of the 
diplomatic process 
she cares a lot about how she represents this country and so 
shell do her best said ms tate 
it turns out the two women will be spending a good deal of time 
together in moscow 
besides the visit to the kremlin cathedral of the assumption 
they are scheduled to tour the tretyakov art gallery later in the 
week 
the president and mrs reagan will see their counterparts at the 
welcoming and departure ceremonies as well as the kremlin state 
dinner and the us reciprocal dinner held at the ambassadors 
residence spaso house 
the most lengthy and private encounter between the couples will 
come after they attend a performance of the bolshoi ballet the 
gorbachevs have invited them to dinner at a private country house 
or dacha outside the city 
but it is unclear whether reporters will have as much access to 
the two women as in the december summit when journalists were able 
to pepper them with questions during a nearly hourlong tour of the 
white house 
though the american couple is staying only five days in the 
soviet capital mrs reagan plans to spend an entire day in 
leningrad an hours flight away 
whether that trip was planned to alleviate some possible 
friction at this summit neither the white house nor soviet 
officials will say 
ms tate said she believes mrs reagan is well aware that it has 
been more than a dozen years since a us first lady and president 
visited soviet soil and is therefore intent on making a good 
impression with the soviet people 
ive always said while her husband represents the head of the 
country she represents the heart ms tate said 
a senior us official who who spoke on condition he not be 
named said the oneupmanship that occurs when the two women meet 
isnt surprising 
the personal chemistry between the two women isnt good he 
said adding i guess thats because theyre much alike they 
are both strong women 
hewett said that compared to soviet wives in the past raisas 
role has been a remarkable one and that the couple has been 
attempting to show their nation its time to enter the 20th 
century 
but he noted that mrs gorbachev has been the target of internal 
soviet criticism for her high public stance and he predicted she 
will tone down the assertiveness she displayed in washington 
gorbachev wants the intermediate range nuclear forces 
treaty and other than that he wants an amiacable atmosphere at the 
summit to show that he is in charge hewett said adding that the 
first ladies can contribute to that notion 
on her own mrs reagan is scheduled to visit a soviet 
elementary school in moscow where shes expected to try out the 
few russian phrases shes been learning 
apparently stung by reports that she was not prepared for mrs 
gorbachevs forceful style and extensive knowledge of us history 
art and political theory mrs reagan embarked on her own course of 
study 
the first lady has read several books on soviet history 
culture art and the russian revolution said her spokeswoman 
elaine crispen 
she has also viewed several videos on the country including one 
produced by turner broadcasting system and a series on the country 
for abctvs good morning america reported by the couples son

a reputation for ruthlessness stuck to robert f kennedy 
because it seemed to explain something about him 
he was the kid who lived to tackle in football games the 
diligent young aide to sen joseph mccarthy the hound on jimmy 
hoffas trial the designated sob in john f kennedys 
campaigns the carpetbagger senator from new york the 
candidate for president who waited until eugene mccarthy had led 
the way 
reputation for ruthlessness is even in the index of an 
admiring biography by arthur m schlesinger jr 
but bobby kennedy was also according to luella hennessey a 
nurse who worked for the family the most thoughtful and 
considerate of the kennedy children 
in a roman catholic family that lived for politics he was the 
one boy who might have become a priest 
hes got high moral standards brother john once said 
bobby was the passionate one the brother of the greatest 
intensity a brooding quality some found to be deeply irish 
my he is unassimilated isnt he the poet robert lowell 
remarked after meeting him 
bobby first channeled that passion into college football then 
into service as an indefatigable aide to congressional committees 
and his brothers campaigns finally bereft of the brother he 
idolized he became a passionate advocate of civil rights and 
after years of backing the war an opponent of the bloodshed in 
vietnam 
bobby resembles me more than any of the other children 
patriarch joseph p kennedy once said he had the same capacity 
for likes and dislikes for love and hate 
robert francis was the seventh of nine kennedy children 10 
years younger than joe jr and eight years younger than jack 
when you come from that far down he once said you have to 
struggle to survive 
he was the smallest of the four boys accidentprone and clumsy 
but determined to keep up 
unhappy at his slow progress in learning to swim young bobby 
tried to learn all at once by jumping off a yawl into nantucket 
sound where he thrashed until joe pulled him out 
it showed either a lot of guts or no sense at all depending 
on how you looked at it said jack 
herbert stokinger his football coach at milton academy 
recalled bob at only 160 pounds loved to crunch he loved 
to hit his man and when he hit he seemed to come alive 
bobby was an allout said supreme court justice william o 
douglas who took the young attorney along on a visit to the soviet 
union in 1955 if he was climbing a peak or hiking a trail there 
was nothing else in the world to do but that 
schlesinger author of robert kennedy and his times traces 
the reputation for ruthlessness to jack kennedys campaign for the 
senate in 1952 bobby the campaign manager once booted a local 
labor leader out of the office saying if youre not going to 
work dont hang around here 
when jack kennedy decided he didnt want to wage a joint 
campaign with massachusetts gov paul dever he sent his brother to 
deliver the bad news dont give it the joint campaign to 
them jack told him but dont get me involved in it 
jack kennedy dever reflected after the campaign which he 
lost is the first irish brahmin bobby is the last irish 
puritan 
bobby played a similar role in the presidential campaign of 
1960 inside the campaign he was the tireless investigator and 
goad schlesinger wrote responsible for everything but the 
speeches outside he became the man to do the harsh jobs saying 
no telling people off whipping the reluctant and recalcitrant 
into line 
well before the 1960 campaign bobby had earned a national 
reputation as a relentless investigator 
in 1952 his father arranged for him to work for sen joseph 
mccarthy the crusading anticommunist who headed the permanent 
subcommittee on investigations of the senate government operations 
committee 
mccarthy had made the acquaintance of the kennedy family after 
coming to washington in 1947 and had won the admiration and 
support of fellow irishman joseph kennedy 
mccarthy made bobby an assistant counsel one of 15 to his 
young chief counsel roy cohn kennedys major work was a report 
detailing that threefourths of the cargos reaching china were on 
westernflag ships this at the time china was sponsoring the 
communist side in the korean war 
the committees more famous work the hunt for subversives 
within the government was energetically led by cohn and g david 
schine 
cohn and schine claimed they knew from the outset what was 
wrong and they were not going to allow the facts to interfere 
said kennedy who resigned from the committee after six months 
at this time in his life bobby made a disagreeable impression 
even on some friends of the family theodore sorenson jacks 
speechwriter found the younger brother to be militant 
aggressive intolerant opinionated somewhat hollow in his 
convictions 
bobby returned to the government operations committee in 1954 as 
counsel for the minority democrats resuming his fencing matches 
with cohn on june 11 in the acidic armymccarthy hearings 
kennedy and cohn nearly came to blows in the hearing room in what 
one newspaper headline called a hate clash 
even after mccarthy was censured in 1954 bobby felt a personal 
loyalty to the republican from wisconsin in 1955 he walked out on 
a speech by edward r murrow who had denounced mccarthy in a 
famous cbs broadcast 
kennedy became majority counsel of the investigations committee 
under sen john l mcclellan after democrats regained control of 
the senate in 1954 first he went after teamsters president dave 
beck and then jimmy hoffa who led the union after beck was 
convicted of tax evasion 
kennedys pursuit of hoffa was bitter and personal on both 
sides and continued when kennedy became attorney general in his 
brothers administration hoffa called kennedy a young 
dimwitted curlyheaded smartaleck

in the kennedy administration bobby was not only the attorney 
general but was also acknowledged as the presidents closest 
adviser that closeness was in some ways a union of opposites 
john kennedy was the more secure the freer of the two 
freer of his father of his family of his faith of the entire 
irishamerican predicament schlesinger wrote the two 
brothers had moved in different directions in adolescence and young 
manhood john establishing his intellectuality robert his 
toughness john his independence robert his commitment to the 
family 
devastated by his brothers death bobby struck his associates 
as withdrawn almost shrunken he adopted his brothers habit of 
smoking cigars and began carrying around one of jfks old coats he 
read greek tragedies and the work of albert camus and turned to an 
old passion football 
everybody was trying to get the hate and the anger out of 
their systems pierre salinger jfks old press secretary told 
lester and irene david authors of bobby kennedy the making of a 
folk hero 
bobby was absolutely relentless salinger said he 
attacked the man with the ball like a tiger slamming bruising and 
crushing and so did everyone else one guy broke a leg and you 
couldnt count the bloodied noses and contusions 
bobbys own political campaigns were preceded by long bouts of 
indecision he didnt announce his candidacy for the senate in new 
york until the latter half of august 1964 although he wound up 
winning easily 
because he was a kennedy there was always talk some hopeful 
some despairing that he would someday run for president 
he remained an enigma something the cartoonist jules feiffer 
ridiculed in 1967 as the bobby twins 
the good bobby is a fervent civil libertarian the bad bobby 
is a fervent wiretapper the cartoon said adding if you want 
one bobby to be your president you will have to take both for 
bobbies are widely noted for their family unity 
bobby wavered again in 1968 before jumping into the presidential 
race days after sen eugene mccarthy had run a close second to 
president lyndon johnson in the new hampshire primary 
it is hard to forgive kennedy his shy calculating delay in 
declaring himself or forgive the shaggy rudeness of his final 
entrance lowell said in oregon even though he affirmed his 
admiration for the man 
jacqueline kennedy worried in the spring of 1968 do you know 
what i think will happen to bobby the same thing that happened to 
jack there is so much hatred in this country and more people 
hate bobby than hated jack 
on the night he won the california primary bobby spoke for a 
moment with kenneth odonnell a longtime kennedy friend 
you know kenny he said i feel now for the first time 
that ive shaken off the shadow of my brother 
within hours he was dead

for those who loved robert kennedy and pinned 
their hopes on his 1968 presidential candidacy the whatif 
game has become a form of catharsis 
twenty years after he was gunned down they remember him as he 
was then a youthful 42yearold heir to the political crown of 
his slain brother president john f kennedy 
in his 30s as his brothers attorney general and chief adviser 
he had been thrust into the center of key issues of the 60s the 
civil rights struggle the cuban missile crisis and the vietnam 
war as a new york senator he adopted as his cause the plight of 
the poor and then he decided to run for president 
what if he had lived 
the question was asked at a recent rfk remembered conference 
and the answers came in a flood from those who had known him well 
it would have been a better country they said there would have 
been no president nixon no watergate the vietnam war would have 
ended earlier the poor would have had an advocate that counted 
the young would have eschewed violence for peaceful participation 
in the system 
or is this just wishful thinking 
one kennedy family biographer david horowitz says it was 
unlikely robert would have become president and calls the 
speculation idle 
its fantasy time said paul schrade the former united auto 
workers official who was shot with kennedy on june 5 1968 and who 
organized the conference 
schrade whose skull was pierced by one of the assassins 
bullets recalled the moments just beforehand as rfk thanked 
wellwishers after a speech my own feeling when he was shaking 
hands was we have a president then i turned and got hit 
schrade is not alone in believing kennedy would have won and 
might have resolved some of the eras most troubling problems 
no one can tell where roads not taken might have led said 
scholar and kennedy family intimate arthur schlesinger jr yet 
the likely probability is that robert kennedy would have gone on 
from his victory in the california primary to win the democratic 
nomination for president and that he would have beaten richard 
nixon in the fall election 
such a presidency schlesinger said would have saved lives by 
withdrawing american troops from vietnam in 1969 rather than 1972 
and would have slowed the nuclear arms race with the soviet union 
the minority view that kennedy would have lost the election and 
would have had little impact on national policy is posed by 
horowitz who in 1968 was editor of ramparts the radical 
magazine that spoke for the new left 
i dont think he would have won said horowitz coauthor of 
the kennedys 
there was no support for bobby kennedy on the left the 
john f kennedy government was responsible for the vietnam war 
bobby kennedy was dangerous from their point of view the blood of 
vietnam was on his hands 
horowitz who has since become an ultraconservative dismisses 
the idea that kennedy was the lost leader who could have turned the 
nation on a new idealistic course 
bobby kennedy was a complex guy and theyve totally drained 
the reality of the guy for this romantic symbolic view horowitz 
said this is rewritten history 
pollster mervin field whose california poll has charted 
political trends for nearly 40 years agreed that rfk is more and 
more glorified over time but hes convinced that kennedy would 
have defeated hubert humphrey and eugene mccarthy for the 
nomination and nixon in the general election 
you know bobby was very controversial he said but he 
came of age in the 68 campaign and he had some special qualities 
tom hayden believes a kennedy candidacy would have calmed the 
chicago democratic convention of 1968 and averted violent clashes 
between antiwar demonstrators and police 
part of me feels the emptiness of missed possibilities and 
always will said hayden now a calilfornia assemblyman there 
will never be another robert kennedy there will never be a 
time as poignant or important but there is work to be done 
among those who see kennedy as the nations lost hero is jack 
newfield the village voice writer who began his book robert 
kennedy a memoir hours after he had witnessed kennedys 
shooting in the ambassador hotel kitchen 
i started to write it that night as therapy and catharsis 
newfield explained 
robert kennedys assassination is a wound that hurts more not 
less as time passes he wrote recently it was an amputation 
with a conservative streak in his personality kennedy would 
have forged a new coalition of liberals and conservatives in the 
democratic party newfield suggested 
he would have helped liberalism shed its skin and become 
almost more contemporary said the writer it was certainly a 
lost possibility that will never be recovered 
one of those closest to kennedy in his final days was his 
special assistant for public information edwin o guthman who 
acknowledges that a robert kennedy presidency was not a sure thing 
i dont know that he would have won said guthman the 
only thing you can be sure of is he would have gotten the 
nomination thats pretty clear 
guthman who helped edit a new book robert kennedy in his own 
words said rfk would be remembered for his fight against 
organized crime his civil rights work and his advocacy for the 
poor 
he added one thing thats certain is had he lost the 
election he would not have retreated he would have stayed in 
there and fought for what he believed in

the arms control treaty president 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev came close to 
agreeing to in raiseyouone negotiations in iceland is on the 
table again in moscow still enticing and still elusive 
but us officials do not expect reagan to engage this time in 
impromptu derringdo headtohead negotiating with gorbachev of 
the sort they partook in at reykjavik in october 1986 
the united states and the soviet union have been negotiating 
off and on since 1982 on a strategic arms reduction treaty known 
as start the united states proposed a 30 percent cut in both 
nations stockpiles of longrange nuclear weapons the soviet union 
countered by proposing 50 percent 
it looked for a moment like gorbachev and reagan might have a 
deal or at least agreement at the top on the framework for a deal 
when they met in iceland 
but reagans dream of a spacebased missile defense system 
star wars proved too great a stumbling block 
gorbachev wanted testing limited to the laboratory reagan 
wanted real world testing they could not agree and parted in 
disappointment start went back to geneva where both sides have 
been negotiating 
now it appears too late for a start agreement soviet officials 
say more than 1200 points of disagreement exist 
the issue is awesomely complex especially the question of 
verification strategic weapons can be delivered by bombers or 
missiles 
missiles can be fired from land planes ships or submarines 
landfired missiles can be launched from fixed sites or movable 
sites mobile missiles systems of which the soviets have two and 
the united states have none 
the two sides are unable to find acceptable ways to verify 
cutbacks in such easily hidden systems 
another issue is whether a start agreement would ban existing or 
future intercontinental ballistic missile systems 
on top of that reagans star wars program remains a seemingly 
insurmountable obstacle the soviets want to restrict tests in 
space and will not agree to cuts in offensive weapons unless they 
can call the reductions off if they conclude star wars violates the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
its now clear there is no way these questions can be shaped 
up in treaty form in time for the summit secretary of state 
george p shultz said may 12 in geneva switzerland after winding 
up presummit talks with his soviet counterpart foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
that being the case us officials do no expect reagan to try 
to bridge the gap in facetoface talks with gorbachev 
at their first summit in geneva in 1985 the two leaders spent 
time alone in front of a roaring fireplace and then walking 
outside in the snappy swiss fall air 
the informality of the arrangement with only their interpreters 
present helped break the ice 
as they strolled back from a conversation in a garden gazebo 
gorbachev accepted reagans proposal for annual summit meetings 
apparently that was the only time in their three summit meetings 
that oneonone sessions produced a substantive result 
at their second summit in reykjavik reagan was alone with 
gorbachev for about 25 minutes mostly discussing human rights 
when they turned to the detailed issue of arms control and 
swapped proposals that escalated until it seemed there would be a 
breakthrough in the arms race reagan had shultz at his side 
reykjavik did set the stage for the treaty signed by reagan and 
gorbachev last december in washington to eliminate all us and 
soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
in washington reagan and gorbachev were alone for about a 
halfhour again the subject was human rights 
in moscow apart from the opening night dinner reagans program 
calls for two private sessions with gorbachev 
the first will be in the kremlin shortly after the president 
arrives from helsinki finland a gorbachev greeting is all that is 
anticipated on reagans third day in moscow they will be alone 
again 
even without a start breakthrough there is much on the arms 
control agenda for them to discuss 
they may sign an agreement under which each side would notify 
the other before testing a landbased or submarinebased missile 
giving the place of launch and intended target 
they may sign protocols calling for experiments to establish 
more thorough means of verifying two treaties that have been agreed 
upon but never verified by the senate although experts believe 
both sides are adhering to them 
these are the threshhold test ban treaty signed on july 3 1974 
and the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty signed may 28 1976 
banning nuclear tests greater than 150 kilotons more than 100 
times more powerful than the hiroshima bomb in world war ii 
gorbachev in a grand gesture may announce the unilateral 
withdrawal of 50000 to 100000 forwardbased soviet troops in 
europe in an effort to spur agreement on a reduction of both sides 
conventional forces in europe 
western experts say the soviet bloc has a 21 advantage over the 
west in conventional forces the mutual and balanced force 
reduction talks went on for 14 years without producing agreement 
finally the superpowers may agree on ways to bring about a 
worldwide ban on chemical weapons forty nations are negotiating at 
the united nations committee on disarmament on a ban but the talks 
are stalled over the intrusive verification measures that would be 
required to assure compliance these weapons can be manufactured in 
ordinary chemical factories without attracting attention

president reagans trip to moscow 
promises to be short on substance but rich in symbolism the gipper 
visits the evil empire the captain of capitalism vs the ruler of 
communism the great communicator costars with the mediasavvy 
kremlin chief 
over five days of talks in the kremlin beginning sunday reagan 
and soviet communist party general secretary mikhail gorbachev are 
not expected to produce the nucleararms treaty that they once 
hoped to sign in moscow nor are they expected to announce any 
breakthroughs on other subjects 
the headline of this summit is that there is no headline the 
summit that didnt bark said stephen sestanovich a former 
national security council staff member who runs the soviet studies 
program at the center for strategic and international studies in 
washington 
this is not a highwater mark said rozanne ridgway an 
assistant secretary of state its sort of like catching your 
second wind 
white house communications director tom griscom said maybe we 
can get away from the fact that you only meet because you sign 
armscontrol agreements because there are other things that are 
important too human rights regional concerns peopletopeople 
exchanges 
reagan said he even has some suggestions for gorbachev about 
ways to improve the troubled soviet economy 
if nothing more the summit will move the spotlight for reagan 
away from embarrassing controversies about the nowfailed 
negotiations to remove panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega the 
conflictofinterest investigations of attorney general edwin meese 
and unflattering portraits of reagan in books written by former 
white house aides 
for his part gorbachev will reap benefits because the summit 
should bolster his prestige in advance of a rare communist party 
conference later in the month on his program of economic and social 
reforms 
the visit allows him to demonstrate that he has been able to 
reengage with the united states with the west that he has been 
able to produce from that dialogue agreements such as inf the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces missile treaty signed in 
december that he can describe as we do a relationship which 
is now more predictable mrs ridgway said 
going into whatever meetings hes going into that would stand 
as an accomplishment she said 
a senior us government official said it would be a successful 
summit for gorbachev just getting the most conservative president 
in us history coming to the soviet union 
in his public appearances in moscow reagan plans to offer 
encouragement for gorbachevs reforms and express hope for more 
broadly what you hope will come out of it would be to 
recognize that the relationship between the united states and 
soviet union has changed griscom said 
the issues that we talk about are much broader now he said 
its not just a narrow agenda its a full agenda and it ought to 
stay that way griscom said reagans tactics should stand as a 
model for his successors 
helmut sonnenfeldt a former state department and nsc staffer 
said reagans visit has symbolic and political significance by 
the mere fact that it coincides with the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan 
from the standpoint of this president this coincidence of his 
appearing in moscow while the worlds television screens are full 
of soviet forces leaving afghanistan is a kind of vindication 
of what this president said he was setting out to do when he 
started in 1981 which was to slow down the momentum of soviet 
expansion sonnenfeldt said 
the only thing that is guaranteed at the summit is a series of 
photo opportunties against carefully picked backgrounds 
the news simply may be the remarkable nature of the event 
begin with the fact that no american president has visited 
moscow in 14 years 
moreover only three presidents franklin roosevelt richard 
nixon and gerald ford have ever set foot in the soviet union 
four years ago it seemed likely reagan would wind up as the 
first american president since world war ii not to have a summit 
with the soviet leader 
now it turns out he will have had more superpower summits than 
any other president four in just 30 months 
it is a remarkable turnabout for reagan who earlier in his 
presidency called the kremlin an evil empire and described 
ussoviet relations as a conflict between good and evil a 
tough line of anticommunist rhetoric had been reagans trademark 
for four decades as he preached a gospel of military strength 
who would have thought in the early 80s both in the soviet 
union and the usa that it would be president reagan who would 
sign with us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history 
gorbachev mused in an interview with the washington post 
gorbachev said realism is an important quality in president 
reagan by this i mean the ability to adapt ones views to the 
changing situation while remaining faithful to ones convictions 
reagan and gorbachev held their first meeting in geneva in 
november 1985 and set a goal of a 50 percent cut in strategic 
nuclear weapons and began a course of lowering eastwest tensions 
eleven months later they met in reykjavik iceland where they 
came close to reaching sweeping arms agreements but instead 
parted in anger over a dispute about the us strategic defense 
initiative star wars 
they papered over the star wars disagreement when they held 
their third summit in washington last december the meeting was 
crowned by the signing of the inf treaty 
reagan now considers gorbachev a real friend despite their 
disagreements he says the soviet leader unlike his predecessors 
is not bent on world domination but content to see the superpowers 
live together in peace 
in gorbachev reagan has a formidable rival whose apparent 
selfconfidence media polish and style appeal to westeners 
in fact americans view gorbachev almost as favorably as they do 
reagan and the soviet leader outpolls the president among 
collegeeducated americans according to a media generalassociated 
press survey 
the leaders will get intense media exposure in meetings 
beginning sunday and ending thursday in addition to talks at the 
kremlin they will host elegant dinners for each other and attend 
the bolshoi ballet with their wives 
reagan is not expected to jump out his limousine and wade into a 
street crowd as gorbachev did in washington but the president has 
plenty of attentiongrabbing events on his agenda he plans to 
visit the danilov monastery in moscow to talk about freedom of 
religion reagan also will meet with soviet dissidents and 
refuseniks who are denied permission to emigrate 
reagan is to have lunch at the union of writers with artists 
filmmakers intellectuals and others to discuss freedom of 
expression 
in addition the president is to deliver an address on 
ussoviet relations at moscow university and then conduct a 
questionandanswer session with students 
he also plans a news conference at the us embassy in moscow 
a room in the kremlin has been reserved and time set aside 
wednesday for the signing of any agreements such as a minor pact 
on missiletesting notification anticheating provisions for 
peaceful nuclear explosions and monitoring steps at nuclear test 
sites

carl c icahn is a man obsessed with making 
deals 
before his recordshattering 1364 billion offer for texaco 
inc on wednesday the 52yearold financier had already tracked 
cornered and in some cases acquired some of americas most 
imposing corporations 
there was marshall field amp co the retailer and 
chesebroughponds inc the consumer products company phillips 
petroleum co usx corp acf industries inc trans world airlines 
and on and on 
his scrapbook of corporate raids reads like a standard amp poors 
register of us companies indeed icahn is so well known in the 
takeover business he says he was considered for but turned down 
a role in the movie wall street which starred michael 
douglas as a vicious corporate raider 
always his own boss icahn is a master strategist who recently 
described himself in fortune magazine as obsessive in everything 
i do 
often reluctant to speak to the press he is actually quite 
loquacious in person people who know him say 
i talk to him all the time i mean i listen to him all the 
time theres a difference texaco inc president james w 
kinnear joked recently 
icahns involvement with texaco has been no laughing matter to 
texacos managers however 
after launching a slate of candidates for the companys board of 
directors and negotiating with texaco over the terms of a 
restructuring icahn decided wednesday to take matters into his own 
hands and make an offer to acquire the company at 60 a share in 
cash 
it would be the largest deal of its kind in american history 
holding 148 percent of texacos stock icahn had been 
pressuring the oil giant to put itself up for sale since it emerged 
from a 13month reorganization under the supervision of a 
bankruptcy court judge 
ive learned one thing what counts is which way the tide is 
going on the last day he said recently in describing his 
protracted battle with texaco 
whatever happens it is generally agreed that if anyone could 
dislodge the status quo at texaco its icahn the man whose very 
name can send shivers through boardrooms across the land 
he has made a reputation by buying up shares in companies with 
assets worth more than their stock price then selling the 
companies off later in whole or in pieces at a highe price 
sometimes companies have agreed to buy the stock back at a 
premium to get him to leave them alone a practice known as 
greenmail other times as with trans world airlines and acf 
industries icahn has retained a management role but also has used 
the company as a vehicle for more takeover attempts 
one way or another icahn almost always walks away millions of 
dollars richer 
to his critics icahn is little more than a pirate in a coat and 
tie but icahn says the real villains are corporate chieftans who 
are wasteful inefficient and more interested in protecting their 
highsalaried jobs than looking out for the interests of their 
stockholders 
that more than the money which he does not need is what 
keeps him in the takeover game icahn recently told the associated 
press 
i think theres no question theres a competitive force in me 
but its also a sense of outrage about the way companies are run 
he said 
actually icahns management has been paying off at both twa 
which he took over in january 1986 and acf a conglomerate he 
bought in 1984 and stripped down to its core railroadcar business 
the guy is a deal man one of the toughest negotiators 
youll ever see said john pincavage of the investment firm 
painewebber inc we ought to use him against the russians i 
mean this guy is good

farley inc one of the nations largest 
privately owned conglomerates is going after a major stake in west 
pointpepperell inc a major textile manufacturer which itself 
just swallowed a rival company 
pepperell announced wednesday that farley had filed with the 
federal trade commission seeking permission to acquire between 15 
percent and 25 percent of the west point ga companys 
approximately 32 million outstanding shares 
rumors have been circulating for several weeks that farley 
whose holdings include fruit of the loom inc was interested in 
buying into pepperell 
pepperell said it did not know how much farley owned by william 
f farley already owned or what farleys intent is however 
farley has filed no other papers with security agencies meaning it 
has less than a 5 percent stake in the company 
pepperells stock was among the most active in trading wednesday 
on the new york stock exchange as 12 million shares changed hands 
with the price climbing 4 a share to close at 35375 
a spokesman at farleys chicago headquarters would say only that 
pepperell is a fine company and we think its a good investment 
farley has 300 million available for acquisitions from a bond 
issue earlier this year the spokesman said but some analysts 
expressed surprise over the move because of the high debt carried 
by both farley and pepperell 
farley has about 14 billion in debt and pepperell owes about 
11 billion after its recent 122 billion buyout of rival textile 
maker jp stevens amp co 
it didnt seem to make much sense to me when i first heard 
talk of him farley buying the entire company said kay norwood 
an analyst with interstate securities in charlotte nc 
but she said pepperells acquisition of stevens will pay off 
in a major way and if farley is approaching this from the 
standpoint of investing hes a pretty smart fellow 
patricia ryan an analyst with raymond james in st petersburg 
fla said we had been hearing the rumors that farley was 
interested since the beginning of may i am a little surprised he 
is willing to take on that much debt 
farleys filing under the hartscottrodino act gives the ftc 
and the us department of justice up to 30 days to review the 
proposed deal for anticompetitive effects the agencies can take 
no action seek a negotiated settlement or seek an injunction 
blocking the deal the parties also could voluntarily back out 
pepperell recently became the nations largest publicly owned 
textile company through the stevens acquisition 
pepperell joined with its rival suitor for stevens new york 
investment firm odyssey partners to acquire stevens in a deal 
which left pepperell with most of stevens linen and towel 
operations and gave the company about 25 percent of the nations 
home fashion textile market 
pepperell sold stevens carpet and industrial fabrics division 
to odyssey and to satisfy antitrust concerns sold stevens sheet 
and towel plants to bibb manufacturing co of macon ga 
a healthconscious former doortodoor encyclopedia salesman 
william farley also controls acme boot co anaheim citrus products 
co doehlerjarvis and southern fastening systems through farley 
inc 
farley inc employs about 25000 workers 
late last year william farley toyed with entering the 
democratic presidential derby but backed out in november saying 
he had waited too long to get in the race

burt sugarman says he is not surprised he 
may have lost his bid to put three people on the board of media 
general inc but that the 103 million votes his plan got should 
send a message to the company 
sugarman a californiabased investor launched a 18 billion 
takeover bid for media general earlier this year 
from the outset of the proxy contest with media general we 
recognized that it would be an uphill battle sugarman said 
wednesday after the company announced that preliminary results from 
fridays shareholders vote show the incumbent management nominees

the returns show the three incumbents have received more than 56 
percent of the vote compared with 426 percent for sugarmans 
proposed slate media general president james s evans said 
evans said corporation trust co an election inspection 
company told him the incumbents received 135 million votes and 
sugarmans ticket of himself harold simmons and david gotterer got 
just under 103 million votes 
evans said a final report on the vote will come after both sides 
get an opportunity to inspect proxies and raise any questions with 
corporation trust 
sugarman said the shareholders who backed his slate cast their 
proxies in favor of enhancing values for all shareholders whether 
it be through our 70pershare cash merger offer or another type 
of transaction 
we fully expect that media generals management and their 
board of directors will respect the opinion of this large group of 
shareholders and initiate action that will maximize shareholder 
value added sugarman who in his address to shareholders at 
fridays annual meeting talked about the possibility of splitting 
media general up into two or three smaller companies 
evans said corporation trust told him that 86 percent of media 
generals total outstanding 28 million class a shares voted 
the family of media general chairman d tennant bryan owns 71 
percent of the companys controlling class b shares which control 
seven of the 10 board seats 
sugarman owns 10 percent of media generals class a holdings 
and in february he offered 6150 a share for media general a bid 
he later boosted to 70 a share or about 18 billion 
subsequently he offered his own slate to challenge the three 
bryansupported directors seeking reelection to the boards three 
class a seats 
as the shareholders meeting approached lawyers for both parties 
sought court relief from what they characterized as false and 
misleading information the other side was giving shareholders about 
the proxy battle us district judge richard l williams denied 
both parties motions saying the proper time to file them would be 
after the annual meeting 
any further challenge by the sugarman group is likely to come 
through the courts where we have litigation already pending 
evans said wednesday 
media general owns several daily newspapers including the 
richmond timesdispatch and the richmond news leader as well as 
several weekly papers television stations and cable operations

reduced demand for apples coupled with 
rising foreign supply has prompted the european economic community 
to stop importing the fruit from the united states and some other 
countries according to an eec spokeswoman 
the 12nation european trading bloc imposed import quotas on 
apples this year and orth america which includes apples from the 
united states and canada reached its limit of 17600 metric tons 
in late april ella krucoff said 
the reason the eec thought it was an emergency situation was 
that consumption was down and imports were way way way up ms 
krucoff said in a telephone interview wednesday from washington 
dc 
the quotas will remain in place until aug 31 the end of the 
current apple season she said 
this is a onetime thing ms krucoff said adding that it 
was the first such eec restriction covering us apples in at least 
10 years 
the eec quota system has also banned further imports of apples 
from chile a major supplier at this time of year ms krucoff 
said that countrys limit was more than 142000 metric tons she 
said 
washington state is the largest us apple producer but 
traditionally has not had much success in cracking the european 
market 
however the nation had been enjoying a record export year to 
europe prior to the imposition of the quotas said charles st john 
of the washington apple commission exports to europe had jumped 
from 500000 boxes last year to 2 million boxes prior to the ban 
he said 
a box normally holds about 42 pounds of apples 
the bans impact on total us exports will not be great st 
john said 
normally after the first of may exports really start to taper 
off because of the southern hemisphere crop he said 
still negotiations are underway to allow for additional us 
exports to eec countries he said 
the financial impact of the decision on us apple growers is 
unclear because apples destined for eec countries will now have to 
be sold elsewhere which could depress prices st john said 
he called the eec quota a protectionist activity for the 
benefit of european growers 
washington state produces half the nations supermarket apples 
with this years record crop expected to produce about 67 million 
boxes 
the nation has also produced a record fresh market crop of about 
130 million boxes this year 
about 15 percent of the washington state crop or 10 million 
boxes remains to be sold before the end of the season in august 
st john said adding that most of those apples will go to domestic 
markets 
the majority of washington state exports traditionally go to 
asian countries and st john said it was unclear if the eec ban 
would prompt increased competition with chile for asian markets 
this year 
the eec is made up of france west germany italy luxembourg 
belgium the netherlands denmark greece ireland portugal spain 
and britain

tenneco inc the 10thlargest us oil company 
picked a favorable time to sell its oil and natural gas operations 
analysts say 
i think they see where they can liquidate some assets at 
decent values said hb juengling a gas pipeline analyst for 
howard weil lobouisse friedrichs inc in houston in 1986 the 
values just werent there 
on wednesday houstonbased tenneco announced it would be 
leaving the oil business by selling its oil and gas operations 
concentrating instead on other industrial and pipeline ventures 
the company would not put an estimate on how much the sales 
might bring but george j gaspar an oil analyst with robert w 
baird amp co inc in milwaukee believes tenneco has already courted 
some interested buyers 
i would expect theyve had a nudge already and decided to go 
public with the announcement to solicit other bids to make sure 
they will get the most attractive price possible gaspar said 
tenneco which posted 1987 revenue of 148 billion will use 
proceeds from the sale to help pay its hefty 85 billion debt 
tenneco spokeswoman suzanne thomas said 
the new tenneco will be a financially stronger and more 
focused company said james l ketelsen tennecos chairman and 
chief executive officer 
with significantly reduced debt and capital expenditure needs 
the companys earnings should improve materially and its intrinsic 
value to shareholders will be secured and enhanced he said 
proceeds from the sale also may be used to repurchase shares of 
the companys common stock depending on market conditions and 
total proceeds from the sale ketelsen added 
tenneco has adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to thwart 
hostile takeover bids and prevent someone from gaining control of 
the company without offering a fair price to all shareholders 
the oil and gas ventures being sold are from the tenneco oil co 
subsidiary engaged in oil exploration production refining and 
marketing 
in 1987 the subsidiary had revenue of 33 billion and 
operating income of 233 million its proved reserves of crude oil 
and natural gas liquids were 407 million barrels at the end of 
1987 natural gas reserves totaled 295 trillion cubic feet 
while profitable these businesses are not now providing 
adequate returns on past invested capital and we do not believe 
their market value is fully reflected in tenneco stock prices 
ms thomas said 
the sale will unlock the underlying value and provide us funds 
that will enable us to take advantage of growth opportunities in 
our pipeline and industrial businesses 
the current mix of business in tennecos energy ventures make up 
22 percent of the companys revenue while all its industrial and 
pipeline ventures account for 78 percent she said 
after the sale tenneco will be comprised of 31 percent farm and 
construction equipment 23 percent pipeline 14 percent 
shipbuilding 13 percent auto parts 10 percent packaging and 9 
percent chemicals 
the businesses are tenneco automotive an auto parts 
manufacturer that includes monroe shock absorbers and walker 
exhaust systems packaging corp of america a major producer of 
paperboard molded fiber aluminum foil and plastic packaging 
newport news shipbuilding the largest privately owned shipyard in 
the world and albright amp wilson ltd a manufacturer and marketer 
of specialty chemicals and phosphates 
tenneco said the businesses together have achieved a fiveyear 
compound annual growth rate of 18 percent in operating income and 
have averaged 26 percent return on net assets employed 
the shipbuilding and auto parts companies are worth an estimated 
125 billion each 
tenneco also owns case ih the nations secondlargest farm 
equipment maker and tenneco minerals ketelsen said case should be 
able to reap benefits from further upturns in the domestic 
agricultural equipment business tenneco minerals is a producer of 
soda ash and gold 
tenneco also operates a gas pipeline group a 20000mile 
network of natural gas pipelines serving 26 states

congressional negotiators have ironed out most 
of the details of a 11 trillion fiscal 1989 budget and house 
leaders are hoping the rest of the differences can be resolved in 
time for a vote today 
rep william h gray iii dpa chairman of the house budget 
committee said wednesday there were only about 150 million in 
differences remaining and that he anticipated a speedy resolution 
the house rules committee cleared the way for the vote today 
with its approval on wednesday of a resolution allowing immediate 
action on the budget compromise usually the resolution has to sit 
for three days before a vote congress leaves town at the end of 
business today for a memorial day holiday 
both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that 
follow the outlines of last falls deficit reduction agreement with 
president reagan that agreement spelled out spending totals for 
military foreign aid and domestic agency accounts 
but negotiators have been bogged down for six weeks over 
priorities within the domestic budget 
the budget doesnt require the presidents signature however 
it serves as a guide for congress in producing its 13 annual 
spending bills and any changes in taxes or entitlements that would 
require the presidents signature 
the 14 billion in new taxes for fiscal 1989 contained in the 
deficit agreement were enacted last december 
the budget has to comply with the grammrudman balancedbudget 
law as well as meet the budget agreement with the president the 
reagan administration already has warned that the spending plans of 
the democraticcontrolled congress might exceed the limits of 
grammrudman 
if the administration determines that a deficit of more than 
146 billion could be expected in fiscal 1989 automatic spending 
cuts would be imposed next fall to bring the budget into line 
the budget already is six weeks past its statuatory deadline 
and the house has begun approving spending bills without the final 
budget outline

kissandtell books may generate quick cash 
for former government employees but job hunters could be putting 
the kiss of death on their chances if they complain about past 
bosses experts say 
if you have a grievance the court to resolve that grievance 
is not in your next job interview robert bies assistant 
professor of organization behavior at northwestern universitys 
kellogg school of management said wednesday night 
nobody wants to hire a complainer bies said in a telephone 
interview nobody wants to hire an attitude problem 
kiss and tell have become washington watchwords of late 
former reagan administration aides from budget whiz david stockman 
to spokesman larry speakes to staff head donald regan have penned 
books with what some consider embarrassing references to operations 
in the white house 
bies said revelations such as speakes disclosure that he made 
up some quotes he had attributed to president reagan made speakes 
appear less credible as a spokesman for any firm speakes made the 
disclosure in his book speaking out 
after controversy surrounding the publication of his book this 
spring speakes left his job as vice president of communications 
for the wall street firm of merrill lynch 
maybe the income from the book is enough to compensate bies 
said 
but if speakes is a highly visible spokesman youre always 
going to wonder if hes telling the truth is it speakes or is it 
the ceo chief executive officer thats talking 
bies said that discussing problems with past employers in a job 
interview embarrassing or not almost always sends the wrong 
message 
i may say i want someone to be forthright and open he said 
putting himself in the employers place but most companies dont 
really like that nobody wants a whistleblower they want a 
team player 
people who are willing to approach current bosses about problems 
are needed to keep companies on the cutting edge bies said 
because they can point out performance problems that could be 
costly in the long run but that doesnt change the human nature of 
bosses not wanting to hear about the problems he said 
past problems should be framed positively in job interviews 
with negative statements limited to things such as we had a 
parting of the ways he said 
a warning against employerbashing was also issued by james e 
challenger president of challenger gray amp christmas inc a 
chicagobased consulting firm which helps find new jobs for people 
sour grapes seldom win challenger said in a statement no 
one wants to hire an individual who badmouths a prior employer 
such talk can also raise questions about a persons ability to 
get along with coworkers an essential for productivity he said 
jobseekers should also avoid unrealistic bragging or 
indications that they may know better how to run things than their 
bosses challenger said 
when job hunting the employer is always right he said 
that means leaving your ego at the door when you go into the 
interview

fireblight has struck 60 to 70 percent of 
the pear trees in the yakima valley and will probably reduce the 
current crop officials say 
the blight bacteria which enters during spring bloom has also 
infected trees in the columbia river basin said mike willett of 
the yakima county cooperative extension office 
its a real disaster for those individuals that have to remove 
those trees willett said wednesday 
the infection will reduce the crop but it is impossible to 
predict by how much he said 
washington is the nations second largest pear producer after 
california accounting for about 35 percent of the nations 
production in 1986 according to state department of agriculture 
statistics the crop was worth 727 million to growers that year 
the last for which statistics are available 
so far 50 to 100 acres of pear trees mostly eight to nine years 
old and just coming into production have been destroyed in central 
washington because of fireblight willett said 
it costs 10000 to 15000 to bring an acre of pear trees to 
production he added pears bring 12 to 15 a box 
in most trees the infected branches can be pruned reducing 
production but allowing the trees to survive willett said there 
is no other treatment and the infection period has passed he 
added 
you can spend as much as 800 to 1000 a day in controlling 
fireblight he said 
the bacteria which prevents widespread pear production in much 
of the united states requires warm temperature at bloom time to 
enter the trees willett said 
spring temperatures in central washington are usually too low 
but warm weather last month allowed the bacteria to multiply and 
spread he said 
of the 11000 acres of pear trees in yakima county 60 to 70 
percent have some degree of infection he said 
to the north chelan county which has 7500 acres of pear 
trees has escaped the fireblight problem although that area has 
been hit in past years willett said

the leading supermarket chain in california and is enthusiastic 
about the combination of our alpha beta operations with those of

japanese construction executives thursday called 
for the united states to lift its ban on japanese bids for american 
public works projects now that a construction dispute has been 
formally settled 
japanese and us officials signed an accord wednesday in 
washington that provides for increased us penetration of the 
construction market here smoothing over a 2yearold dispute 
we strongly hope that the office of the us trade 
representative will immediately reverse its decision to name japan 
as one of those countries that should be subject to exclusion 
from us governmentfunded construction projects said hajime 
sako chairman of the japan federation of construction contractors 
in a statement 
taichiro kumagai chairman of the japan civil engineering 
contractors association urged the japanese government in a 
separate statement to internationalize japans contract bidding 
process with a longterm perspective kyodo news service 
reported among the us complaints was that bidrigging was common 
kumagai also said us construction companies should compete on 
an equal footing with their japanese counterparts if the american 
construction industry is aggressive enough kyodo reported 
sako is chairman of taisei corp and kumagai is president of 
kumagai gumi co ltd both are among japans largest general 
contractors 
the washington accord provides for japan to encourage foreign 
participation in major public works projects financed by the 
japanese government and other projects carried out by japanese 
companies with funding from both the central and local governments 
the us government had threatened to invoke legislation 
allowing retaliatory trade moves against japan for what washington 
perceived as an unfairly closed construction market

rowntree plc the british confectioner that is 
trying to keep two swiss suitors at bay on thursday rejected a 
232 billion pound or 43 billion offer from chocolate maker 
jacobs suchard ag 
rowntree said the 1777ashare cash bid from suchard a 
zurichbased candy and coffee group that controls more than 29 
percent of rowntree did not fully reflect the companys value 
investors apparently agree rowntrees stock was trading above 
1850 a share thursday on the london stock exchange 
the bid was the latest development in the battle dubbed in 
britain as the candy bar wars between suchard and nestle sa 
to gain control of rowntree 
nestle based in vevey switzerland and holder of a 16percent 
stake in rowntree has offered 1655 a share or about 391 
billion for the confectioner rowntree repeatedly has rebuffed 
nestles overtures 
on wednesday the british government cleared the way for 
nestles bid by deciding not to refer the proposed takeover to the 
monopolies and mergers commission 
the government also approved suchards stake in rowntree in the 
same manner but said a full bid by suchard would need further 
clearance 
immediately after the approvals were announced suchard said it 
would seek rowntree board approval for a possible cash bid or for 
other means of joining the two companies confectionery businesses 
the conservative governments clearances sparked a row in 
parliament where opposition politicians and some conservatives 
attacked what they saw as the governments failure to ensure that 
yorkbased rowntree remains in british hands 
suchard aggressively began building its stake in rowntree last 
month when it launched a dawn raid that took its holding to 
149 percent 
nestle saying suchard forced its hand then responded with a 
bid for all of rowntree 
but this didnt stop suchard from increasing its stake further 
to just under 30 percent the maximum it could hold under british 
takeover regulations without launching a full takeover bid

the us economy helped by the biggest 
improvement in trade in eight years expanded at a robust annual 
rate of 39 percent in the first three months of the year far 
better than previously thought the government reported today 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health performed far better from 
january through march than it had estimated a month ago 
at that time the department put gnp growth at 23 percent 
about fourfifths of the improvement from that first estimate 
came from a narrowing of the foreign trade deficit which shrank in 
inflationadjusted terms at an annual rate of 167 billion in the 
first three months of the year 
this represented the sharpest narrowing of the trade deficit 
since a 248 billion drop in the first quarter of 1980 
the trade improvement had been estimated as a much smaller 36 
billion last month but that was before the government had data for 
exports and imports in march a month when the trade deficit shrank 
sharply because of a record level of exports 
economists had been expecting an upward revision in the gnp 
report but the 39 percent growth rate was far above most 
estimates the consensus outlook had expected a gnp increase of 32 
percent 
the economy is on a roll it is amazingly strong and resilient 
for such an aging expansion said allen sinai chief economist 
for the boston co 
sinai said he was revising his estimate of growth for all of 
1988 up to 35 percent which would be the fastest growth pace 
since 1984 
it looks like president reagan is going out in a blaze of 
glory on the real economy sinai said the growth in the first 
quarter pretty much locks in a good growth rate for the year 
the economic performance this year is far different than the 
fears raised in the wake of the stock market crash last fall at 
that time many economists said the country could well topple into 
a recession this year caused by consumer fears about the stock 
market downturn 
the strong economic growth has buried recession fears for this 
year but now financial markets have become concerned that the 
economy may be expanding so rapidly that inflation will be 
rekindled 
but the new gnp report did not support any inflation worries 
the revised report showed that an inflation index which measures 
prices of a selection of goods rose at an annual rate of just 17 
percent in the first three months of the year down from a 27 
percent rate in the fourth quarter it was the lowest rise in 
inflation since late 1986 
the reagan administration has predicted that the economy will 
expand at an annual rate of 29 percent for all of 1988 the 
government said that growth as low as 19 percent would be all that 
was needed to meet that forecast many private economists have been 
busy revising their growth estimates upward for 1988 
if you take all the evidence that is available you would have 
to come to the conclusion that the economy is going to do quite 
well for the rest of the year said hugh johnson an analyst with 
first albany corp 
the 39 percent januarymarch gnp growth rate followed an even 
faster 48 percent increase in the octoberdecember quarter 
but the fourth quarter growth masked some dangerous imbalances 
that were not present in the first quarter figure 
almost all of the fourth quarter increase in the gnp wound up as 
unsold inventories sitting on shelves at the same time consumer 
spending was taking a rare nose dive falling by 25 percent the 
biggest decline in seven years that combination has often 
signalled an impending recession 
but in the first quarter consumer spending bounced back rising 
at an annual rate of 43 percent with about half of that increase 
attributed to stronger car sales 
business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual 
rate of 328 percent in the first quarter the fastest advance 
since the first year of the recovery from the 198182 recession 
analysts said much of the investment boom was directly tied to 
trade improvements as american companies have rushed to expand 
production facilities to meet the surge in export demand 
businesses apparently decided that the market crash would not 
affect them because they were depending on an export boom this 
year not increased domestic demand said michael evans head of 
a washington forecasting firm 
in another report the government said today that aftertax 
corporate profits rose by 05 percent in the first quarter a 
modest gain which followed a much bigger 26 percent rise in the 
fourth quarter 
the various changes left the gnp rising by 372 billion in the 
first quarter an annual level of 392 trillion

ford motor co will meet the 275 
milespergallon fuel economy standard for its 1989 fleet rather 
than seek a reduction in the standard from the federal government 
a ford executive said 
ford will meet the corporate average fuel economy or cafe 
standard drawn up by congress in 1975 by selling more small cars in 
1989 said philip e benton jr president of the ford automotive 
group 
cafe is the average fuel economy rating of the vehicles each 
automaker sells in the united states during a model year which 
begins oct 1 and ends sept 30 
that means that a company whose large cars sell better than its 
small cars could be penalized because its average fuel economy is 
too low 
the us transportation department lowered the standard from 
275 mpg to 26 mpg three years ago at the request of ford and 
general motors corp the nations two largest automakers 
chrysler corp the thirdlargest us automaker argued against 
the change because its fleet met the 275 mpg standard 
ford and gm had argued that low stable gasoline prices had 
increased demand for larger and luxury cars the companies 
threatened to cut big car production and lay off workers to meet 
the standard rather than pay stiff fines for selling the larger 
vehicles 
gm and the automobile importers of america which represents all 
japanese automakers and all but two european makers have asked 
that the 275 mpg standard for 1989 be reduced to 26 mpg standard 
that was in effect for 1986 1987 and 1988 models 
benton said ford would break with the other automakers and added 
that ford is continuously reducing the weight of its cars and 
engines 
were effecting change in that way and we also are using heavy 
marketing actions were selling every small car we possibly can to 
bring down the average benton said wednesday 
ford also will use credits built up in previous years when its 
fleets average fuel economy exceeded the standards he said 
benton was in monroe to present a quality award to the monroe 
stamping plant

grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade then turned mixed as some 
meteorologists offered drier weather forecasts 
analysts attributed the lower opening primarily to 
followthrough selling after wednesdays sharp declines especially 
in the soybean pit 
wednesdays losses were sparked by predictions for rain in the

offered a drier outlook and bullish traders began buying contracts 
on any significant dip in prices said walter spilka an analyst in

notion of an impending energy crisis to the nations consciousness 
energy policy has fallen off the national agenda said one 
of the organizers of the group gov george a sinner of north 
dakota even though polls indicate that national leaders and the 
american public are convinced there will be another energy crisis 
the president of the new denverbased group the american 
energy assurance council john jenkins said the group will try 
to grapple with conflicting solutions such as the

organizations and the expandproductioneverywhere solution of some 
oil companies 
there is no set agenda said michael beatty senior vice

we vehemently disagree with 
charles ebinger an industry consultant and staff member at the

a utility today tentatively agreed to give 
up the 53 billion shoreham nuclear plant for 1 and let the state 
dismantle it it would be the first time a completed us atomic 
plant was abandoned before it opened 
under the agreement long island lighting co would pay the more 
than 400 million to decommission the plant on long island 55 
miles east of manhattan but would be guaranteed 5 percent rate 
increases in each of the next three years 
we have gotten everything we wanted gov mario cuomo said 
at a news conference today 
the agreement would allow financially troubled lilco to continue 
to operate as a privately owned utility the state had threatened a 
takeover of the entire company 
utility spokesman james lois confirmed the agreement but 
withheld detailed comment 
once completed the deal will end years of attempts by 
environmentalists local activists and others to close shoreham 
situated on long islands north shore 
i think that utilities throughout the united states will be 
very mindful of what happened to the long island lighting 
company said irving like of bay shore a shoreham opponent and a 
member of the long island power authority lipa a board the state 
set up to examine a possible takeover of the utility 
the plant conceived in 1965 was completed in 1984 10 years 
late and more than 80 times over budget it never has opened 
because of the refusal of state and local officials to approve an 
emergency evacuation plan 
the officials had argued that long island because of its 
geography could not be safely evacuation during a nuclear accident 
and without such approval the federal nuclear regulatory commission 
had refused to issue an operating license 
state efforts to close shoreham accelerated after the nrc in 
october eliminated the rule requiring state and local government 
participation in an evacuation plan 
the entire agreement must be approved by the state public 
service commission and some parts of it need the legislatures 
approval new generating plants would then be built on long island 
to ensure an adequate supply of electricity 
the accord was announced 95 minutes after cuomos midnight 
wednesday deadline for an agreement earlier cuomo threatened to 
call off negotiations and resume a lawsuit to keep shoreham closed 
if lilco failed to agree to a deal 
the settlement provides a prototype for opponents of other 
nuclear plants because it had been widely believed that once 
shoreham was completed it would be licensed despite state and 
local government opposition said harold holzer an aide to vincent 
tese cuomos chief negotiator in the deal 
the future of the plant has been in limbo for years and the 
delays in construction and the licensing effort along with massive 
cost overruns drove lilco to near bankruptcy 
in addition to fears over shorehams safety negotiations have 
been driven by the fact that lilcos nearly 1 million customers pay 
the second highest electricity rates in the country second only to 
neighboring consolidated edison 
the utilitys problems were highlighted after hurricane gloria 
in september 1985 knocked out power to more than 80 percent of 
lilcos customers

suits being filed nationwide against chrysler 
corp have delayed payments of at least 500 each to owners of 
chrysler cars sold after being testdriven while their odometers 
were disconnected 
chrysler the nations thirdlargest automaker agreed last year 
to pay about 16 million to more than 32000 owners but will not 
pay the money until the settlement is approved late this summer by 
us district court judge john nangle in st louis 
approval of the settlement has been delayed in part by continued 
filing of classaction suits against chrysler nationwide said 
marcia aud nangles deputy clerk the suits must be consolidated 
and heard in st louis 
so far aud said 38 suits have been filed against chrysler by 
owners and state attorneys general and were still adding new 
ones 
chrysler pleaded no contest last year to federal charges of 
odometer tampering contained in an indictment handed down in st 
louis the investigation was launched in missouri after state 
police noticed in several instances in which traffic citations were 
issued to chrysler employees that the odometer read zero and 
speedometer was out of commission 
chrysler stopped disconnecting odometers in october 1986 after 
learning of the government investigation 
chrysler also extended the warranty on the cars to seven years 
or 70000 miles from the standard five years or 50000 miles the 
warranty is in effect despite delays in the settlement chrysler 
spokesman steve harris said 
last july chrysler chairman lee iacocca said selling cars 
tested with disconnected odometers was dumb and that selling 
cars damaged during the testing went beyond dumb and reached all 
the way to stupid 
all automakers disconnected odometers during testing at one 
time but general motors corp and ford motor co halted the 
practice in the 1970s

thanks in part to the newfound popularity 
of its 757 twinjet boeing co appears headed for its fourth 
consecutive year of record commercial jet orders industry analysts 
say 
the giant aerospace company may be entering a sellers market 
for aircraft and an order announced wednesday by american airlines 
for as many as 100 of the 757s may be one of the last at bargain 
prices the analysts believe 
american said it was ordering 50 757s for delivery between july 
1989 and november 1991 with an option to purchase 50 more for 
delivery through december 1993 robert w baker americans vice 
president for operations declined to give exact figures but said 
the deal was on very favorable terms for american with the firm 
order worth slightly more than 2 billion and the second 50 planes 
about the same 
today united airlines announced it was ordering 30 757s with 
options on 30 more united chairman stephen m wolf placed the 
value of his companys order at more than 2 billion 
and 10 days ago international lease finance corp of beverly 
hills calif ordered 100 boeing jetliners and took options for 24 
more the 46 billion price 25 billion in 
1988 orders was possible 
boeing commercial airplanes president dean thornton on wednesday 
acknowledged that 1988 could see a record but said he felt 
uncomfortable saying boeing was on a roll 
it cant keep up at this pace he said the past three 
years have been successive record years in terms of orders i dont 
think it can continue but i wouldnt hazard a guess as to when it 
will end 
thornton said its a coincidence that boeing is receiving large 
orders in quick succession but demisch and others say now may be 
the time to buy 
were moving toward a sellers market for airplanes demisch 
said adding that as orders continue to build aircraft prices 
could rise by 10 percent to 20 percent 
the desire to sort of get in before the gates close and prices 
go up is not far from the airlines mind he said 
nisbet said the recent huge orders may encourage everyone to 
hurry up and get their place in line for new aircraft needed in 
the 1990s 
demisch said american got a very good deal at a price of 
roughly 40 million a plane depending on configuration 757s 
normally sell for 41 million to 47 million each 
americans new jets will primarily replace its aging boeing 737s 
and 727s baker said the 194passenger 757 jetliner with a range 
of about 3300 miles burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable 
aircraft and will be powered by two rolls royce engines 
the 50 additional planes if ordered would be delivered through 
december 1993 in an interview with the seattle times last week 
american president and chairman robert crandall said the airline 
could order yet another 100 757s by the end of the century 
baker said american chose the 757 because of its economy 
quietness and because crews flying the widebody boeing 767s in 
americans fleet can easily switch to the smaller jet also he 
said more than half the parts in 767s are interchangeable with 
those in 757s 
boeing launched the 757 in 1978 as a hightechnology 
fuelstingy replacement for its 727 trijet which entered service 
in 1964 but a drop in fuel prices stalled sales with just 239 
757s ordered through 1987 
i think most of you know that weve been probably a little 
disappointed with the 757 over the years thornton said 
thats changed with 90 of the planes ordered this year 
baker said the 757 makes sense with growing passenger demand 
coupled with growing airport congestion he said the realization 
that those of us who are going to survive deregulation must begin 
the process of retiring the first generation of aircraft makes this 
airplane really kind of come into its own and be recognized for its 
merits 
he said american wasnt rushed into the order but had studied 
it for months youre betting your company when you buy a fleet 
of 50 or 100 airplanes he said you want to be darn sure 
youve looked at everything you can think of 
thornton said boeing plans to increase 757 production at its 
renton plant from four to five a month sometime next year however 
he said boeing doesnt expect to need to hire many new workers

writers will be able to reach their public by 
computer in june when a florida company introduces a way to browse 
through books electronically 
we consider this the latest exercise of first amendment 
rights said company president joe barcheski 
the bookmart database will allow authors to reach readers 
without going through the grueling process of submitting and 
rewriting manuscripts for a publishers approval 
the database will also allow publishers to scan new books 
bookmart is the brainchild of writer samuel bleecker who along 
with two partners have formed pubtronix based in pompano beach 
fla 
the online computer service will provide access to five pages 
of text and a bookjacket description of each volume for the price 
to the shopper of a telephone call 
the author or publishing company however will have to pay 250 
a year for each computer listing 
after browsing listings by subject author or title readers can 
order a work by credit card and get it on a floppy disk or in book 
form if it has been published barcheski said 
pubtronix announced bookmart last weekend at the florida state 
writers conference in an effort to attract unpublished writers 
seeking a forum outside the publishing world 
in the next few weeks we will also be competing agreements 
with several publishers for listings barcheski said 
bookmart will go on line sometime in midjune with about 1000 
titles listed and hopes to expand to as many as 10000 titles he 
said the online telephone number to rac information systems in 
great neck ny will be advertised in computer magazines and on 
electonic billboards nationally when the startup date is set 
barcheski said 
in addition to books barcheski bleecker and herb rubinsky 
president of rac plan to use the database to sell rare books such 
as first editions and those carrying an autograph that would be of 
interest to a national audience the men also intend to begin 
compiling magazine articles with racs staff of 30 
eventually the men want to offer bookmart in kiosk units to 
book stores as a way to boost selection without being buried in 
inventory barcheski said 
with a bookmart listing a publisher can effectively reach the 
home shopper and in the near future the book store browser for a 
very low cost said bleecker publishers are therefore no 
longer required to distribute physical inventory to have a 
nationwide audience

the 757 is a twinengine shorttomedium range jetliner and is 
the most fuelefficient aircraft boeing builds it also is designed 
to meet the most stringent noise and operational restrictions at 
us airports 
boeing has had 356 jets ordered in 1988 with an estimated value 
of 149 billion thats just 10 fewer than the 366 boeing 
commercial jets ordered for all of 1987 the value of 1987 jet 
orders was 199 billion a company record 
industry analysts say boeing could be headed for its 
fourthstraight year of record orders with some predicting a total 
of up to 25 billion 
boeing has had 120 firm orders for 757s this year until 
recently the plane was a disappointment for boeing which only had 
239 orders for the twinjet from 1978 through 1987 however 
industry officials say the planes fuel efficiency larger size and 
availability in the early 1990s have brought it new popularity 
united said it would finance part of the transaction through the 
sale of its mcdonnell douglas dc8 fleet to gpa corp a subsidiary 
of gpa group ltd based in shannon ireland the dc8s are less 
fuelefficient than the 757s 
united which was started by boeing pratt amp whitney and three 
other companies in 1929 is boeings largest customer with the new 
order united has purchased 528 jetliners from boeing including 
all models the company has built 
united and boeing severed corporate ties in 1934 
the announcement came at a meeting at which shareholders 
approved a change in the name of uniteds parent company from 
allegis corp to ual corp 
the company formerly ual adopted the name allegis in february 
1987 as part of an illfated effort to structure itself as a 
travelandhotel conglomerate the ensuing stockholder uproar 
forced the resignation of thenchairman richard ferris and led to a 
selloff of all of the companys holdings except united 
united already has taken delivery of 22 737300s part of an 
order of 110 from boeing and will begin taking delivery of 15 
747400s next year spokesman joe hopkins said

wall street has lost 8200 jobs since octobers 
stock market crash and likely will shed another 18000 workers by 
years end an economist said thursday 
the report by new york university professor matthew p drennan 
was slightly more optimistic than his forecast late last year that 
the securities industry in new york would lose 28000 jobs by the 
end of 1988 because of the crash 
drennan revised his prediction to about 26000 because trading 
volume on the new york stock exchange held up better than expected 
during the first quarter of 1988 
however that support for employment is now crumbling he 
said 
market volume last month was 17 percent lower than in april 
1987 and so far this month is 12 percent off last mays level 
drennan of nyus urban research center said in an annual economic 
report 
this pattern of greatly reduced volume of stock trading is 
expected to continue through the remainder of 1988 consequently 
securities industry employment in the city is likely to take 
another big hit he said 
other reports have made similar forecasts the state 
comptrollers office in december predicted the loss of 20000 
securities industry jobs in 1988

the tentative decision to close the 53 
billion shoreham reactor on long island ny may be only the 
first of several severe blows awaiting the nations troubled 
nuclear power industry 
an agreement reached early thursday between the long island 
lighting co and new york state would result in the abandonment of 
shoreham which though complete has never generated commercial 
power it would be the first us nuclear plant to be scuttled 
without ever operating 
a similar fate may await the equally costly seabrook nuclear 
plant in new hampshire like shoreham seabrook has been embroiled 
in legal and political problems over the issue of whether residents 
and tourists in its muchtraveled resort area could be safely 
evacuated in the event of a major emergency 
adding to seabrooks woes is the recent declaration of 
bankruptcy by the plants owner public service co of new 
hampshire gov john sununu recently said the bankruptcy filing may 
actually be a blessing in disguise allowing a new financial 
package to be put together that could put seabrook back on track 
but many financial analysts doubt that and democratic 
presidential frontrunner michael dukakis who if elected would 
appoint a new nuclear regulatory commission is foresworn to close 
the reactor 
in addition to seabrook more than a dozen other plants are in 
deep trouble voters in the sacramento calif area will decide in 
june whether to close the longplagued rancho seco plant owned by 
sacramento municipal utility district 
the pilgrim plant in massachusetts owned by boston edison will 
be the subject of a similar referendum in november 
rancho seco and pilgrim were singled out recently by an 
antinuclear group public citizen as the two worst commercial 
nuclear plants in the nation the group virtually duplicating a 
worst list put out a year earlier by the nrc also named 14 
other plants as candidates for permanent shutdown 
among them are two peach bottom reactors in pennsylvania shut 
down by the nrc last year after federal investigators found plant 
operators sleeping on duty and several plants belonging to the 
tennessee valley authority whose nuclear program has been 
embroiled in a wide variety of management and safety problems 
all five of tvas operating reactors were shut down in 1985 for 
safety improvements and only one sequoyah unit 2 was allowed 
just recently to restart meanwhile tva had to cancel plans to 
build eight other reactors and construction already under way of 
four others was slowed 
while tva hopes to restart all the facilities closed in 1985 
the future of those under construction remains dark 
the industry insists the overall outlook for nuclear power is 
good if not bright it points to an increase of 10 percent last 
year in electrical generation and an improved safety and efficiency 
record in which sudden shudowns dropped to 27 per reactor 
compared with 39 the previous year and 74 in 1980 
but the fact remains that many reactors are candidates for 
closure and no utility has planned a new nuclear power plant since 
the 1970s 
among other plants cited by public citizen and the nrc as 
problem reactors are fermi no 2 in michigan oyster creek in new 
jersey three browns ferry tva units in alabama davisbesse in 
ohio dresden no 2 in illinois fort st vrain in colorado and 
byron no 1 in illinois

the rapid growth of compaq computer corp which 
surpassed 1 billion in sales in record time is expected to slow 
significantly because of a shortage of computer memory chips 
officials said 
neither computer industry analysts nor compaq executives would 
estimate how big of an impact the chip shortage will have except to 
say that the companys growth will be less robust 
i dont think they will go backward but they wont have that 
rapid growth rate of the past said bob greiner marketing 
manager for the dallas research firm storeboard inc to what 
extent they will be affected is still in question 
for the first three months of the year compaqs sales more than 
doubled over the same period a year ago increasing to 439 million 
from 211 million net income rose to 47 million from 20 million 
last year 
compaq is the worlds leading manufacturer of portable personal 
computers and a leading manufacturer of desktop personal computers 
the houstonbased company made us business history by being the 
first company to break the 1 billion mark in sales within five 
years of starting up 
rod canion compaqs chief executive officer said wednesday 
that the companys second quarter sales would suffer because of the 
memory chip shortage 
there will be some impact on sales although it is hard to 
estimate how big it will be in the second quarter canion said 
canion said he does not expect the companys growth in sales and 
earnings to match 1987s growth rate last week he told 
shareholders at the companys annual meeting that the rapid 
quarterly percentage growth would slow down 
compaq will not be suffering from the chip shortage alone most 
computer manufacturers are scrambling for memory chips some other 
major companies complaining about the pinch are apple computer inc 
and sun microsystems inc 
the shortage will affect most manufacturers to some extent 
greiner said 
industry observers blame the chip shortage on several factors 
including production cuts by japanese semiconductor makers after 
the introduction of tariffs by the united states last year 
the most serious shortage has been for dynamic random access 
memory or dram semiconductors which are the most widely used 
computer memory chips 
japanese companies produce more than 75 percent of the dram 
chips sold worldwide and some analysts say the majority of these 
chips are going to japanese computer makers

attacked an american bank with rocks and firebombs thursday and 
farmers protesting us agricultural imports hurled cow dung at 
police during a clash outside the national assembly 
prime minister lee hyunjai ordered a crackdown on violent 
protests and radicals but the mandate seemed to have little effect 
on the wave of antiamerican rage 
about 30 students dashed out of sidestreets and hurled rocks and 
firebombs at a branch in southern seoul of the koram bank police 
said police said four people were arrested 
the bank a joint venture between the bank of america and korean 
business groups was not damaged it had not yet opened for 
business and had shutters over the windows and entrance 
riot police fired tear gas in front of the national assembly 
building in seoul to disperse farmers protesting plans to increase 
imports of us agricultural products 
at least five people were injured 
about 500 farmers with two calves at the front hurled cow dung 
and clashed with police after a rally attended by about 1500 
farmers police kicked and punched the protesters who shouted 
oppose american beef and its pressure to open the korean market 
one calf ran amok through 1000 riot police surrounding the 
assembly compound 
the united states is pushing south korea to widen its markets to 
american imports the trade issue has fanned antius sentiment 
the attack on the bank was the first on us business interests 
in the wave of violent protests that have been aimed mainly at the 
united states 
a senior government official said wednesday that the 
antiamerican sentiment of the radical students is not shared by 
most koreans 
hyun hongchoo minister of legislation said we are 
confident the majority of the people are happy with our relations 
with the united states he was commenting at a lunch with the 
press about the recent unrest 
radical students blame the united states for the partition of 
the korean peninsula and accuse washington of supporting military 
rule in the south they demand the withdrawal of the 42000 us 
troops stationed in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
the korean peninsula was divided by us and soviet troops that 
ended the japanese occupation in 1945 at the end of world war ii

hurled homemade bombs at the us embassy in seoul

campaign and called a major antius rally in seoul on friday to 
mark the end of the eighth anniversary of a 1980 civil uprising in 
kwangju where thousands of students and citizens battled police in 
daily protests 
dissidents contend the united states condoned the south korean 
armys bloody suppression of the nineday uprising in which at 
least 191 people were killed

annual rate of 39 percent from january through march much better 
than previously believed because of the biggest decline in the 
trade deficit in eight years the government reported thursday 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health was propelled during the first 
three months of the year by an export surge a rebound in car sales 
and a boom in business capital investment 
the report represented a sharp upward revision from an initial 
estimate made a month ago that the gnp grew at a more modest 23 
percent rate in the first quarter 
it provided fresh evidence that the economy has escaped 
unscathed from last falls stock market crash and it sent 
economists scurrying to revise up their growth estimates for the 
full year 
you would have to say that not only was the stock market crash 
ignored but the economy thumbed its nose at it said robert 
dederick chief economist of northern trust co of chicago 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said he had 
revised his forecast to show gnp growth of 35 percent for all of 
1988 that would be the fastest rate of growth since 1984 
the reagan years are ending with a bang the first quarter gnp 
report shows an economy that is amazingly strong and resilient for 
such an aging expansion sinai said 
all the good economic news is especially pleasing to republicans 
in an election year when they hope george bush will win the white 
house running on a platform emphasizing the peacetime record of 66 
months of expansion since the last recession in 198182 
the economic growth in the first quarter was a far cry from the 
recession that some analysts had predicted immediately following 
the oct 19 collapse in stock prices however economists now have 
begun to worry that inflationary pressures have begun rising 
because the economy is growing so rapidly 
those fears are present despite the fact that a gnp price index 
which measures a changing marketbasket of goods rose at an annual 
rate of just 17 percent in the first quarter the smallest 
increase since late 1984 
analysts said this performance masked growing price pressures 
stemming from tight labor markets and the rising number of 
industries that are pushing against capacity constraints 
unemployment fell to a 14year low of 54 percent in april 
in a second report thursday the government said aftertax 
corporate profits rose just 05 percent in the first quarter of the 
year following a much larger 26 percent rise in the fourth quarter 
bruce steinberg senior economist with merrill lynch in new 
york said the weak profit rise in the first quarter would add to 
inflation pressures as companies seek to boost revenues by raising 
prices in coming months 
the inflation environment is deteriorating the economy is 
growing too rapidly for stable prices steinberg said 
analysts predicted that the federal reserve whose job it is to 
worry about inflation will push interest rates higher to dampen 
demand the central bank already has tightened credit conditions 
twice in the past two months 
frank cappiello a wall street investment adviser said the fast 
gnp growth in the first quarter was adding to inflationary 
pressures and setting the stage for a recession next year 
what the gnp increase reflects is light from a dying star 
cappiello said during an appearance in omaha youre seeing the 
best growth in the economy i think from here on in it will be 
dragged down by higher interest rates 
but beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser 
disputed that contention saying there was no evidence of either 
recession or inflation threats in the gnp figures 
we had an upward revision in real growth a downward revision 
in inflation and greater strength on the exports side sprinkel 
said in an interview these are all objectives of this 
administration 
the administrations current forecast calls for gnp growth of 
29 percent this year with the fast start the economy could grow 
as slowly as 19 percent for the rest of the year and still reach 
that estimate 
about 80 percent of the improvement in the gnp report from the 
previous estimate came from a bigger shrinkage in the trade deficit 
than previously believed the trade defict declined at an annual 
rate of 167 billion in the first quarter the sharpest narrowing 
since early 1980 as exports after adjusting for inflation rose 
207 percent while imports were up only 34 percent 
the 39 percent overall gnp growth rate followed an even 
stronger 48 percent rise in the fourth quarter however that 
increase came almost entirely from a buildup of unsold inventories 
which was occurring at the same time that consumer spending was 
posting a rare decline 
growth in the first quarter was much more balanced with 
consumer spending rising by 43 percent reflecting in large part a 
rebound in car sales 
in addition business investment for capital equipment shot up a 
remarkable 328 percent the biggest rise in more than four years 
analysts attributed this investment surge to the improving trade 
deficit which has sent us companies scurrying to expand 
production facilities in order to meet higher export demand 
analysts said they were looking for slightly slower growth of 
around 3 percent in the current apriljune quarter due to an 
expected slowdown in growth of export sales consumer spending and 
business investment from the rapid rate of the first quarter 
the various changes left the gnp rising by 372 billion in the 
first quarter an annual level of 392 trillion after adjusting 
for the effects of inflation

for years the 757 had been the stepchild in 
boeings fleet a plane highly praised but seldom bought 
but in a flurry of multibilliondollar orders including united 
airlines announcement thursday that it was ordering 30 757s and 
taking options on 30 more the twinengine mediumrange jetliner 
suddenly is boeing commercial airplanes hot item 
its been a very pleasant week hasnt it said boeing 
spokesman jim boynton 
boeing valued the 30 firm orders at 13 billion united did not 
give exact figures for the total orders value except to say it was 
in excess of 2 billion including planes spare parts and 
engines 
on wednesday american airlines confirmed a longexpected order 
for 50 757s valued at more than 2 billion and options for 50 
more at the same price 
on may 16 international lease finance corp ordered 100 boeing 
planes and took options on 24 the firm orders include nine 757s 
with a value of 46 billion for the 124 planes the order was a 
record for boeing 
this year alone boeing has received orders for 120 757s and 
options for 80 more in comparison just 239 757s had been ordered 
from 1978 when the plane was launched through 1987 
in all boeing has had 356 jets ordered in 1988 with an 
estimated value of 149 billion thats just 10 fewer than the 366 
boeing commercial jets ordered for all of 1987 the value of 1987 
jet orders was 199 billion a company record 
industry analysts say boeing could see its fourth straight year 
of record orders perhaps up to 25 billion 
at a thursday news conference boeing commerical airplanes 
president dean thornton said the american order was a strong 
endorsement for boeing and for a plane he felt will be a mainstay 
for us airlines 
i think most of you know that weve been probably a little 
disappointed with the 757 over the years he said 
but now thornton said the 757 is fast becoming the new 
workhorse for us carriers because it answers the challenges of 
operating into congested or controlled airports where high capacity 
is desired without adding flights 
the 757 was to be a larger quieter and more fuelefficient 
replacement for the threeengine 727 which was designed in the 
late 1950s and entered service in 1964 the 757 won accolades but 
few orders especially as fuel prices went down in the mid1980s 
airlines seemed content to stay with the older fuelguzzling 
planes rather than front the 41 million to 47 million cost of a 
757 also said william whitlow analyst with dain bosworth inc in 
seattle the hub and feederline route system airlines adopted 
favored smaller shorterrange airplanes 
the 757 was an airplane a bit ahead of its time in terms of 
our ability to assimilate it robert baker americans vice 
president for operations said wednesday but he added the 
nowproven economics and operating characteristics of the airplane 
i think have been borne out 
uniteds 757s will have pratt amp whitney engines and will carry 
192 passengers americans jets will use rolls royce engines and 
haul 194 passengers both versions have normal ranges of about 
3300 miles 
analysts and airline executives cite several reasons for the 
757s sudden popularity 
the airlines older planes are requiring more maintenance 
its just like a car you can keep going forever with 
maintenance and repairs said paul nisbet analyst at 
prudentialbache securities in new york but theres a point 
where the economics dont pay 
the 757 is cheaper to run boeing says its unsurpassed in 
fuelefficiency burning up to 43 percent less than a 727 and up to 
33 percent less than competing twinjets it also uses a flight crew 
of two instead of three for the 727 
baker also noted that 53 percent of the parts in a 757 are 
interchangeable with boeings widebody 767 and that pilots 
certified for one plane are easily switched to the other 
the 757 exceeds the toughest airport noise standards said 
stephen m wolf chairman president and chief executive officer of 
united 
the airplane industry may be turning into a sellers market 
nisbet said production for comparable planes including boeings 
smaller 737 mcdonnell douglas md80 and airbus industries a320 
is nearly all booked if you want an airplane delivered before 
1991 you have to go for the 757 he said 
wolfgang demisch analyst with union bank of switzerland in new 
york said that as production fills up airplane prices also will 
rise the desire to sort of get in before the gates close and 
prices go up is not far from the airlines mind he said 
thornton acknowledged that boeing is on a roll but did not 
think it could last 
i just believe that things go up and down he said 
united will receive its first 757 in august 1989 and five more 
that year wolf said it will get 21 more in 1990 and three in 1991

wellknown corporate raider paul a 
bilzerian who frequently battles industrial titans has filed a 
slander suit against a little league officer 
the suit filed wednesday in pinellas circuit court charges 
that rick brannelly first vice president of the northeast little 
league made false statements about bilzerian that appeared in an 
article in the st petersburg times on saturday 
the dispute revolves around whether the league met its 1987 
fundraising goal or fell short by 5225 as charged by bilzerian 
who bought the singer co in february for 106 million 
in spring and summer bilzerian has coached a baseball team of 
5 6 and 7yearolds and his tampa based firm bicoastal financial 
corp has sponsored a team 
in the newspaper article brannelly maintained bilzerian failed 
to provide a matching 5000 donation he promised to the league if 
it raised 5000 on its own 
brannelly claimed bilzerian welshed on the promise made 
before dozens of people according to the times 
bilzerians attorney michael ingram was quoted in the story 
saying the league failed to meet its fundraising goal and 
therefore bilzerian was under no obligation to make the donation 
such statements by brannelly the suit alleges have a 
tendency to injure bilzerian in his office occupation business or 
employment 
the suit seeks punitive damages in excess of 5000 the minimum 
amount required to get a civil case into circuit court 
bilzerian was out of town and could not be reached for comment 
thursday ingram was called but was not available thursday 
singer spokesman tom elliott said only i think its all pretty 
much in the complaint

the fuel tank collapse that caused the 
contamination of drinking water in three states stemmed from a 
dimesize flaw in the tanks nearly 50yearold steel wall ashland 
oil inc said thursday 
the 4milliongallon storage tank collapsed jan 2 as it was 
being filled with 38 million gallons of oil spilling more than 
700000 gallons into the monongahela river and then the ohio river 
a combination of factors aggravated the impact of the flaw and 
caused the wall of the tank to split in less than a second sending 
the oil over the dike like a skier going off a jump according 
to ray mesloh head of a team from an independent research 
institute that investigated the accident for ashland 
the steel wall of the tank was first assembled in cleveland in 
1940 it was taken apart and reconstructed at the companys 
floreffe terminal south of pittsburgh in 1986 
the original welds and the welds made during the reconstruction 
made the steel more brittle said mesloh of the battelle memorial 
institute of columbus ohio 
other factors in the collapse were the relative weakness of 
world war iiera steel pressure from the 38 million gallons of 
diesel fuel inside and the cold weather he said 
if you had a combination of these same events it could happen 
again said john r hall chairman of the ashland ky firm 
however hall said once again and i hope for the last time 
we apologize 
the flaw was in the steel before ashland assembled the tank near 
cleveland it was caused by a torch possibly one used to cut the 
plate at the mill where it was made mesloh said 
the flaw a small rusting cavity about oneeighth inch deep 
was located near a weld about 8 feet from the bottom of the tanks 
48foothigh wall said mesloh displaying the defective steel at a 
news conference 
it is likely that flaw would have been found by xraying 
mesloh said 
hall also emphasized that similar fuel tanks are in use around 
the country and that the jan 2 accident could happen elsewhere 
too 
the american petroleum institute said there were about 1850 
major oil terminals in 1987 many with more than one tank in the 
united states the institute does not track the age of tanks said 
spokeswoman jane van ryan 
ashland has concluded that improvements are needed in some of 
the 1000 large tanks it has inspected and has abandoned the 
practice of moving old tanks hall said 
the estimated 713000 gallons of oil that escaped the tanks 
protective dike forced communities along the monongahela and ohio 
rivers in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia to close their 
drinking water intakes about 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents 
were without tap water for almost a week 
the accident spawned a flurry of legislation in congress 
including a bill that rep doug walgren dpa on thursday said 
would have required ashland to test the tank before using it 
that is not now required 
walgrens bill would set standards for aboveground tanks with 
capacity of morew than 4200 gallons 
the us bureau of standards the us environmental protection 
agency and the pennsylvania department of environmental resources 
are also investigating the ashland spill 
besides failing to obtain all the local permits required for 
erecting the tank ashland said it failed to fill the tank with 
water a test recommended by the american petroleum institute 
more than 4000 claims seeking about 18 million in damages have 
been filed against ashland which says it is fully covered by 
insurance ashland said it has paid about 7 million including 6 
million in cleanup costs

the house passed a 11 trillion federal 
budget for the 1989 fiscal year thursday after negotiators from the 
house and senate solved a monthlong dispute over domestic spending 
the measure was approved by a 201181 vote and sent to the 
senate where it was expected to be accepted after that chamber 
returns from its memorial day recess next month 
twentysix republicans joined 175 democrats in voting for the 
measure which is moving toward its earliest congressional approval 
in years the legislators however already have upheld their 
annual tradition of missing the april 15 deadline set in the law 
for completing the budget 
the spending plan would satisfy the limits placed on defense 
domestic and international affairs spending that were set in last 
falls budget summit agreement between president reagan and 
congressional leaders 
it also would avoid automatic spending cuts under the 
grammrudman balanced budget law later in the year by producing a 
deficit just under the laws 146 billion deficit ceiling 
it has been designed bipartisanly in good faith to avoid 
the automatic cuts said house budget committee chairman william h 
gray iii dpa 
however some lawmakers warned that grammrudman spending cuts 
could still be forced later this year if the economy worsens 
we should be scaling back spending below the summit levels 
said rep willis d gradison jr rohio 
under the law the budgets deficit will be recalculated in 
august and a weakening economy usually increases federal spending 
and reduces the taxes it collects 
the last dispute that negotiators from the two chambers resolved 
was over new spending in domestic entitlement programs in such 
programs formulas in the law automatically decide how much money 
will be spent 
the house wanted to increase that spending by 100 million next 
year and 13 billion over three years while the senate sought a 
500 million increase for 1989 and 2 billion more over three years 
under the compromise such spending will grow by 375 million 
next year and by 22 billion over the three years with most of it 
being used for nutrition programs for the poor 
the measure contains 2995 billion in new defense spending 
181 billion for international affairs and 148 billion for 
domestic programs for the next fiscal year which begins oct 1 
the amount for the pentagon is an 81 billion increase over 
military spending this year but below the amount that would have 
been needed to keep up with inflation 
education health social services and job training programs 
would all be given enough money to keep up with inflation and 
selected other programs including those for aids research and 
treatment antidrug initiatives space and air traffic control 
would get enough new money to surpass the costs of inflation 
the electionyear measure would allow an additional 14 billion 
in antidrug spending to be provided later this year if congress 
and the white house decide that an emergency exists the extra 
money would have to be covered by spending reductions in other 
areas or by new revenues 
in legislation passed in december that enacted the terms of the 
budget summit 14 billion in new taxes for fiscal 1989 already 
have been written into law the budget approved thursday includes 
no other additional revenues 
the house passed its original version of the budget march 23 
and the senate completed its work april 14 
the two chambers had differences small ones in budget terms 
over how the domestic spending was to be divided 
the senate sought 134 billion for space and science programs 
and 366 billion for education and job programs while the house 
wanted 125 billion for science and 376 billion for education 
in their compromise the lawmakers agreed to 13 billion for 
science and 372 billion for education 
they also agreed to a 4 percent pay raise for military personnel 
and federal civilian employees to take effect in january the 
senate had sought a 2 percent increase for civilians and a 43 
percent raise for the armed services while the house had sought a 
3 percent increase for each category 
the raise also would apply to members of congress who already 
earn 89500 annually if included in forthcoming appropriations 
bills members of congress would earn 93080 a year a raise of 
3580 
the budget does not require the presidents signature and is 
used as a guideline by congress as it passes the 13 appropriations 
bills that actually provide money for federal spending but this 
year its value seems even more questionable than usual 
while the housesenate negotiators spent six weeks trying to 
iron out their differences the two chambers appropriations 
committees began work on their spending measures 
thus the house already has passed four of the 13 appropriations 
bills while the senate appropriations committee has taken the 
first steps in writing its spending measures

higher electricity prices caused by 
scrapping the shoreham nuclear plant could cramp long island 
industry already burdened by high energy costs economists and 
industrialists said thursday 
no doubt about it higher rates will hurt growth said 
martin melkonian a hofstra university economics professor but 
it wont be the factor that brings long island to its knees 
melkonian was a coauthor of project 2000 a report on the 
islands energy needs written for businesses 
he noted that the long island lighting cos rates have 
increased more than 300 percent in the last decade compared with a 
national average of 195 percent and are already among the highest 
in the nation 
according to energy user news a trade publication lilco has 
the seventhhighest commercial rates in the nation for residences 
the cost is 117 cents per kilowatthour meaning a household that 
uses 600 kilowatthours a month would have a monthly bill of 
7020 lilco reported 
we are used to the high cost of energy melkonian said 
the cost of energy in relation to the total value of the product 
output here is relatively small 
under thursdays agreement to dismantle the neverused 53 
billion plant the estimated 500 million decommissioning cost will 
be paid for by ratepayers over 10 years 
richard kessel a state negotiator on the lilco deal and gov 
mario cuomos chief adviser on consumer issues said the agreement 
would increase the average long island residents electric bill by 
a little more than 3 per month 
lilco would get a guaranteed 5 percent increase in rates each 
year for three years and 5 percent would be the target increase 
for each of the following seven years 
james larocca president of the long island association an 
organization of 2000 companies said that would mean a 63 percent 
total increase 
this is a very expensive deal which has to be borne entirely 
by long islanders he said our rates will be significantly 
higher when three other utilities in new york are in the midst of a 
multiyear rate freeze 
we are already seeing the consequences of long islands 
decreasing ability to compete larocca said 
a direct mail company recently fled suffolk county for 
pennsylvania and saw its electric bill plummet from 48000 a month 
to 19000 a month larocca said 
grumman corp of bethpage the navys prime contractor and long 
islands largest employer expanded its facilities last year but 
did it in houston citing the high cost of energy and taxes on long 
island 
grumman has 23500 employes on the island it pays 30 million a 
year for electricity 
people with cheaper power can be more competitive in the 
market said robert harwood a grumman spokesman the cost has 
to be passed along to the consumer and in our case that is the 
american taxpayer 
harwood found a silver lining however to the steady rate hikes 
planned some certainty and stability with companies able to plan 
better 
our overall problem is that we did not know what was going to 
happen with rates said harwood now we can plan 
long island has a thriving economy with one of the lowest 
unemployment rates in the country a highly skilled and educated 
work force and one of the largest multinational business 
communities in the region 
there will be a substantial impact on rates particularly with 
those in the manufacturing industry said martin cantor suffolk 
countys director of economic development but i think the rates 
will be absorbed without too much hardship 
wayne prospect deputy supervisor of the suffolk legislature 
criticized the proposed settlement as an economic bailout for 
lilco 
the people of long island wanted that nuclear power plant 
closed he said i guess higher electric rates is the economic 
tradeoff

striking television and movie scriptwriters 
claimed they had split management ranks thursday after 64 
producers including the makers of the cosby show and johnny 
carsons talk show signed independent contracts with the writers 
union 
several of the firms that signed with the writers guild of 
america produce successful television programs for nbc 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
representing the industrys biggest producers downplayed the 
signings which represent a significant break in the 12week strike 
the walkout has forced delays in the start of the fall 
television season and reruns of such shows as late night with 
david letterman and the tonight show starring johnny carson 
the 9000member writers guild of america was scheduled to vote 
thursday night in new york and los angeles on contracts with 
smaller socalled independent producers 
voting results wouldnt be known until friday said union 
spokeswoman cheryl rhoden in los angeles 
were anticipating ratification ms rhoden said we see 
it strategically as a good move at this time to break the logjam 
with the alliance 
ms rhoden released the names of the independent producers and 
the terms of their threeyear contract with the wga before members 
gathered to vote on the proposal the contract includes increases 
in foreign residual payments and provides writers with greater 
creative input 
the list of 64 production companies includes the carseywerner 
company which produces two of the most popular shows on 
television the cosby show and a different world 
the makers of tonight signed a contract and the producers of 
late night have agreed to a contract but havent signed said 
union president george kirgo others signing were producers of 
alf and the muppets 
also on the list are michael landon productions which makes 
highway to heaven and you and me kid productions the maker of 
the nowcancelled the days and nights of molly dodd 
most of the producers appear to be film companies such as the 
gaby film group inc and some such as paul keyes productions 
produce tv specials 
none of the 217 big producers who belong to the alliance have 
signed independent contracts management spokesman herb steinberg 
said thursday 
the large producers whose ranks include such bigtime 
moviemakers as columbia pictures and such tv giants as mtm and 
lorimar employ 80 percent of the industrys writers and supply 84 
percent of primetime tv he noted 
the alliance producers are holding strong steinberg said 
this is all very very interesting but it has no impact on 
the new season or on the contract negotiations steinberg said 
what theyre talking about makes no change in the point of 
conflict which are the deficits for productions of onehour 
primetime tv shows and the depressed market for those shows in 
syndication 
nearly 180 producers had discussed independent agreements which 
meet the writers demands on residual payments they receive when 
shows are rerun and for consultation on script changes made during 
filming she said 
those are the main points of contention in the strike which 
began march 7 
on monday both sides sat down with a federal mediator for the 
first time since april 8 the talks at alliance headquarters in the 
los angeles suburb of sherman oaks failed to produce agreement on 
any issue 
negotiators agreed to meet in small groups saturday and set 
another full bargaining session tuesday
