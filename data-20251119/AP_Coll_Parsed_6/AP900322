the countrys leaders have admonished 
rich indonesians for years not to flaunt their wealth with luxury 
homes or other conspicuous consumption 
now president suharto wants businessmen to help redistribute 
wealth by selling shares in their companies to cooperatives 
home minister rudini declared in 1988 it is an insane idea 
for people to compete to build mansions similar to the white house 
they are asocial 
retired adm sudomo coordinating minister for general policy 
and security said last year the slow spread of wealth was a 
greater danger to stability than any political or military threat 
sudomo said the side effects of economic development were 
not moving rapidly enough to cope with all the social problems so 
we can narrow the gap between the rich and the poor 
last month suharto said of course we cannot avoid 
differences in levels of income and abilities but these 
differences should not be allowed to grow into a social gap that is 
contrary to the spirit of togetherness 
we must recognize these differences and take steps to minimize 
them before it is too late 
per capita annual income is less than 500 in this nation of 178 
million people the gap between rich and poor is great and a middle 
class began to emerge only in the last generation 
in his annual budget speech in january suharto urged companies 
to sell 25 percent of their shares to cooperatives so the coops 
could become a national economic force he suggested making 
loans to poorer cooperatives to help them buy the shares 
businessmen were surprised by the proposal and many dismissed it 
as a populist response to criticism of powerful conglomerates 
indonesia has 34000 cooperatives with about 26 million members 
they were established to give small farmers the advantages of mass 
buying and marketing and to help introduce modern methods in 
handicraft and cottage industries 
cooperatives enshrined in the constitution were intended as an 
economic complement to stateowned enterprises and private 
companies 
suharto has promoted cooperatives as the ideal way to help the 
poor in a land where 70 percent of the people make their livings in 
the countryside 
unfortunately most cooperatives are perceived as poorly 
managed undercapitalized and burdened with bad debts of 6000 
rural credit coops a 1988 world bank report said 1272 are 
insolvent but not entirely hopeless while 1658 are candidates for 
dissolution or liquidation 
some businessmen startled by the idea of selling shares to 
cooperatives hope suhartos suggestion was a pep talk rather than 
a new government policy of divestiture 
as explained by radius prawiro coordinating minister for 
economy finance and industry this is an appeal and not an 
entirely new policy helping one another must not be spelled out by 
legislation this is an appeal to the private sector to give 
cooperatives a chance to own part of the equity 
prawiro and other senior officials said private companies would 
not be compelled to sell stock to cooperatives but it was not made 
clear how such transfers might occur without compulsion 
business analysts said few privately held companies would 
voluntarily sell shares to cooperatives or lend money to finance 
the purchases 
suhartos proposal followed months of statements by economists 
politicians and educators that efforts to deregulate the economy in 
recent years benefited big enterprises at the expense of small 
ones especially of cooperatives 
there were complaints that many of indonesias largest companies 
are controlled by ethnic chinese who make up less than 5 percent 
of the population but have great influence 
any belief that the suharto proposal would fade away ended with 
a major presidential gesture march 4 on that sunday he was host 
on his farm at tapos 45 miles south of jakarta to 31 of 
indonesias business leaders most of them ethnic chinese 
a more equitable distribution of incomes should be developed 
together with growth and stability otherwise social jealousy and 
upheaval may break out to annihilate all our achievements the 
jakarta post quoted him as saying 
he said conglomerates were useful in fighting tough 
international competition but should not become domestic 
monopolies because they can also manipulate prices causing the 
people to suffer the paper reported 
antara the national news agency quoted suharto as saying that 
the government hopes the selling of shares to cooperatives will 
proceed smoothly if the transactions do not run smoothly the 
government will take measures to see to it that they do 
if this fails to proceed the existing gap will only give rise 
to social envy and social upheavals antara quoted him as saying 
there will thus be no winners 
suharto told the businessmen the government would prepare a list 
of worthy cooperatives deemed to have the necessary financial 
resources 
that way he said you would not have to look for such 
cooperatives

it seemed so simple a pair of scientists 
had unlocked the mysteries of nuclear fusion after an inspirational 
walk in the woods and a couple of shots of sour mash 
it was never so simple again 
a year after chemists b stanley pons and martin fleischmann 
announced theyd achieved room temperature or cold fusion in a 
laboratory flask their work remains devilishly difficult to 
duplicate 
not only has subsequent research failed to nurture initial hopes 
for a clean and limitless energy source but cold fusion has cooled 
to the point that a chief supporter describes it as a commercial 
gamble 
this is one of those areas where a certain amount of 
risktaking is needed but the payoff is very large said fritz 
g will director of the statefunded national cold fusion 
institute we need luck and money 
if either is forthcoming it will require a reversal in cold 
fusions fortunes in the laboratory 
as a whole and its always dangerous to characterize how the 
scientific community thinks on this but on the whole the 
scientific community is still extremely skeptical about it said 
ronald parker director of the massachusetts institute of 
technologys plasma fusion center 
pons a university of utah chemistry professor and fleischmann 
of englands university of southampton announced their findings at 
a press conference last march 23 
they described how they hatched the idea for the experiment 
during a hike in the utah mountains then sketched the apparatus in 
pons kitchen over a bottle of jack daniels 
eventually they said they created a nuclear fusion reaction in 
a bottle of deuterium oxide or heavy water using a palladium 
electrode wrapped in platinum wire they ran electricity through 
the two metals and reported that the device put out more energy 
than they put into it 
the announcement stunning in its possibilities conjured 
visions of a cheap relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible 
supply of energy normally fusion has occurred under enormously 
expensive extremes of heat and pressure 
conventional nuclear energy or fission splits atoms fusion 
produces energy by fusing them together 
after the announcement scientists lambasted pons and 
fleischmann for rushing to the popular press with neither a theory 
to explain the results nor ability to reproduce them at will 
a year later they have yet to publish definitive scientific 
papers detailing their research 
other scientists tried to replicate the process few met with 
success and many gave up although work continues in universities 
and centers such as the los alamos national laboratory in new 
mexico and in laboratories in japan india and the soviet union 
the first few months after the announcement was made people 
thought that it would be exceedingly simple to reproduce the 
results will said the complexities were not fully appreciated 
by anyone at that time 
mit researchers conducted experiments but never detected excess 
heat or evidence of a nuclear reaction parker said in a recent 
telephone interview 
to me the question now is is there anything at all to it 
parker said or is it completely a misunderstanding or 
misevaluation of preliminary results 
indeed the department of energys energy research advisory 
board last november refused to recommend federal funding for the 
utah researchers saying their conclusions failed to withstand 
scientific scrutiny 
the institute so far has received funding only from the utah 
legislature which last year appropriated 5 million for research 
and patent attorneys charged with protecting the states interests 
not all the scientists are giving up 
edmund storms at los alamos said he and colleague carol talcott 
have detected tritium considered a sign of a nuclear fusion 
reaction in experiments modeled after the ponsfleischmann 
apparatus 
storms talcott and about 30 other scientists will present their 
findings during the university of utahs first conference on cold 
fusion march 2931 
the really interesting thing about this and i think it has 
relevance to the anger and frustration is that the apparatus was 
so simple so incredibly trivial that the feeling was why cant 
we reproduce it storms said 
pons did not respond to requests for an interview with the 
associated press he defended their claims in a story in the 
deseret news on sunday 
we know what we have we know we have something he said 
to us its an ironclad openandshut case we are going to 
continue with whatever means we have to take this as far as we can 
toward demonstration and practical use

a new survey indicates a jump in interest in 
teaching which fell on hard times in the early 1980s after word 
got around that the only thing tougher than finding a teaching job 
was living on the salary 
enrollment in the nations teaching programs rose by 61 percent 
between 1985 and 1989 and the figure would have been higher had all 
those who applied been accepted according to an unpublished study 
by the american association of colleges for teacher education 
as someone who makes his living teaching people to be 
teachers im ecstatic said gary galluzzo an associate 
professor at western kentucky university and cochair of the study 
and theres more good news while the perennially popular social 
studies have held steady the interest inteacherpoor subjects such 
as math and science appear to be keeping apace 
but the progress is not all positive researchers said total 
enrollments may have skyrocketed but elementary and secondary 
school teachers are still mostly white and female 
minority participation in schools of education exceeds 15 
percent in only six states while 33 states had minority 
publicschool enrollments of 20 percent or more according to the 
survey which was presented in chicago last month at the 
associations annual meeting 
the enrollment thing is fine and all well but the fact that 
they dont have any minorities is really a huge headache said 
mary dilworth director of research and information for the 
washington dcbased association 
explanations for the overall surge vary but the numbers come as 
no surprise to admissions officers who said they have seen a 
gradual but constant increase in enrollment each of the last five 
years 
the average number of educationdegree candidates enrolled at 90 
us colleges and universities surveyed randomly went from 520 to 
835 between 198588 the study said 
administrators at teaching programs around the nation attributed 
improved enrollment largely to the exposure through the mid1980s 
of serious problems in the us education system 
many parents tuned in to the trouble when a national 
geographicsponsored gallup poll in july 1988 indicated americans 
ranked among the bottom third in an international test of 
geographic knowledge and those ages 1824 came in last 
the issue was also signaled by president bushs push for the 
education excellency act of 1989 and projections that the 
demand for teachers would exceed by 1 million the supply needed 
between 1988 and 1995 
its impossible to pick up an article about teachers without 
seeing the word shortage and people seem to be picking this up 
galluzzo said people who always wanted to be teachers and who 
were told there were no jobs are now returning to get their 
credential 
pragmatic incentives have also spurred potential teaching degree 
candidates salaries have risen and encouraging educational 
reforms have slowly taken root education researchers said 
the news went out that teachers were needed and states were 
working for better salaries and conditions said dilworth in 
the late 1960s and early 1970s it was the same situation we were 
told there was a shortage of teachers and by 1982 wed peaked out 
galluzzo said he had no survey results prior to 1985 but 
administrators believe the pool of teaching degree candidates hit 
bottom in 1984 
carly moreno director of admissions at harvard universitys 
graduate school of education said interest in teaching had been 
spurred by demand and discussion but she said some applicants also 
were looking for alternatives to seeking fortunes on wall street 
i think this group knows theyre not in it for the money but 
for their idealism said moreno who received 200 applications in 
1989 compared with 40 five years ago they have anxiety about the 
world and want to contribute in a positive way 
but some administrators said candidates werent necessarily 
coming to education for reasons of pure altruism 
my theory is that most of them have been coming for economic 
security in one measure or another said ly hollis director 
of the university of houstons education center 
the notion that the citizens of this country have elevated 
teaching to a position of respect and dignity is sheer fantasy 
he said god mother country and working with kids is all cool 
but not if you dont have money to pay the rent 
hollis said applications to houstons teaching program had 
jumped dramatically until 1989 when they dropped by more than half 
as texass slumping oil economy began recovering the associations 
nationwide enrollment figures for last year were not complete 
all the posters that uncle sam wants you will bring in a few 
people but when its all said and done its going to take more 
than a flashy campaign to truly get people interested in 
teaching hollis said

in this neat prosperous market town 
in middle england a farm workers wife says shell never vote for 
margaret thatcher again 
she simply doesnt know whats happening to people said 
30yearold joanne woodward a bystander interrupted her the 
womans a tyrant 
for the prime ministers conservative party candidate charles 
prior it is tough on the campaign trail in midstaffordshire the 
socialist labor party looks set to capture the once unshakeable 
conservative constituency in todays byelection 
byelections which fill vacant parliamentary seats are always 
watched for indications of the standing of the government this one 
threatens the tories with their worst byelection defeat in 50 
years 
midstaffordshires last member of parliament who committed 
suicide in december held the district with a huge majority in 
britains 1987 general election now local opinion polls show labor 
up to 28 points ahead 
the labor party poses its most serious challenge since mrs 
thatcher won power in may 1979 and victory here would bolster 
labors prospects of winning the next general election 
those elections arent due until 1992 
i wont deny it we are in some difficulty said prior a 
43yearold publisher 
a brooding statue of lichfields most famous son the 
18thcentury poet and dictionary compiler samuel johnson dominates 
the market place of a town that as far as anyone can remember has 
never voted socialist 
lichfield with 24000 people is the affluent end of a 
semirural constituency north of birmingham 
the people are mostly skilled bluecollar workers and young 
homeowning couples people who through the 1980s deserted labor for 
a slice of the prosperity brought by mrs thatchers freemarket 
revolution 
now they are hard hit by interest rates soaring to 15 percent 
and inflation at 77 percent and rising both have roughly doubled 
since 1987 when mrs thatcher won her unprecedented third straight 
election 
on top of that lichfield votes amid a national furor over the 
introduction next month of a new property tax that will cost many 
families up to onethird more 
there are just two topics in the political small talk over the 
handshakes the tax and mrs thatcher 
she had a lot of good ideas in the beginning and ive always 
voted conservative said mrs woodward but now shes making a 
real mess of things theyd do much better with a different 
leader 
mrs woodward lives in a rentfree cottage on the farm where her 
husband manages the piggery the woodwards paid no property taxes 
in the past but now they must each pay 560 under the new tax 
system 
labors candidate sylvia heal a 47yearold social worker is 
also benefitting from the collapse of the political center after 
the 1987 general election 
the centrist social and liberal democrats tim jones a local 
lawyer took 23 percent of the midstaffordshire vote last time 
compared with labors 25 percent and the tories 50 percent 
jones is down to around 9 percent in the polls with the 
conservatives prior battling for 2830 percent and mrs heal at 
more than 50 percent 
pranksters and singleissue candidates are also expected to grab 
some of the vote 
nine fringe candidates are counting on the ultraprotest vote 
they include lindy sinclairlove of the nice party whose platform 
is taxexempt status for prostitutes 
they probably wont get more than a few dozen votes apiece but 
thats not the point their efforts are worthwhile just for the 
pleasure of watching a tv newscaster bound by equal coverage laws 
trying to keep a straight face as he reads out screaming lord 
sutch monster raving loony party

the human race is 
accelerating the global warming trend by cutting down the worlds 
forests too fast the executive director of the un environment 
program says 
on a global basis only one tree is replanted for every 10 that 
are cut the official mostafa tolba said wednesday 
the deforestation is contributing to the greenhouse effect the 
greatest environmental threat facing humanity he told a conference 
on business and the environment 
he called for a major effort to restore forests around the world 
and to cut emissions of carbon dioxide a heattrapping gas that is 
building up in the atmosphere 
controls on carbon dioxide are inevitable he said calling 
on industry to conduct massive research into production methods 
that pollute less 
tolba a microbiologist from egypt played a major role in 
negotiating the 1987 montreal protocol to reduce use of chemicals 
that deplete the ozone layer the goal is to establish an 
international agreement on greenhouse gases by 1992 
carbon dioxide the main greenhouse effect gas is produced by 
the burning of fossil fuels like oil gas and coal deforestation 
also contributes to the problem because living trees absorb carbon 
dioxide 
the globe 90 conference which began sunday and ends friday 
has attracted more than 2200 delegates from 56 countries an 
accompanying trade fair has drawn more than 600 exhibitors from 15

not changing its tune just its name 
some people dont think sweet adelines indicates what our 
organization is about said jorja jacobs communications director 
for sweet adelines which will become harmony international corp 
on may 1 
the organization is about singing but it has come a long way 
since a group of women adopted the name from harry armstrongs 1903 
song youre the flower of my heart sweet adeline 
now there are 30000 members in a dozen countries from new 
zealand to japan to canada the board of directors voted 
unanimously last summer that an international group deserves an 
international name 
sweet adeline to someone would probably conjure up the gay 
90s club president marsha oneill said wednesday from her 
office in london canada to me you think of gentlemen with 
handlebar mustaches and women in parasols thats the identity of 
the era but thats not us today 
some things will not change said verna lee fowler a member of 
a tulsa chapter 
the change gives you mixed emotions but eventually its going 
to be all right ms fowler said besides we might be called 
harmonizers but were still sweet adelines the spirit is still

the lines 
with half the job done workers who go through the sludge from 
each truck have found 2411 coins 970 pennies 201 nickels 677 
dimes 199 quarters and four 50cent pieces that comes to 13920 
plus a mexican twopeso gold piece 
but city manager beryl robinson jr a coin collector said 
wednesday im still hoping we hit a good one the city could 
conceivably find a coin worth 50000 that is definitely a 
possibility 
he called the mexican piece probably the most minimal gold 
coin we could possibly find 
some other gold coins silver dollars and territorial pieces can 
be worth more he said a 1 moffett gold piece minted in san 
francisco could fetch about 10000 and an 1893 morgan silver 
dollar could be worth more than 300000 
robinson hopes any newfound treasure will go toward defraying 
debts among the debts of the city in the sierra nevada about 125 
miles northeast of san francisco is a 10000 state fine for the

college students are more likely to use condoms 
these days but otherwise their sexual practices have changed 
little in the last 14 years despite the advent of aids a survey 
published today shows 
the study conducted at brown university found that college 
women reported just as much potentially risky sexual behavior last 
year as they did in 1975 before aids and some other sexually 
transmitted diseases became concerns 
besides acquired immune deficiency syndrome genital herpes and 
chlamydia have since emerged as important sexually transmitted 
diseases 
the results indicate that public health campaigns have not had 
a substantial influence on the habits and behavior of these 
welleducated young adults said the study in todays new england 
journal of medicine 
the survey led by dr barbara a debuono found that 12 percnt 
of women in 1975 said their partners always used condoms this 
increased to 21 percent in 1986 and 41 percent in 1989 
but the number of sex partners or the frequency of highrisk sex 
since 1975 remained virtually the same in 1989 9 percent of the 
women engaged in anal intercourse and 21 percent had more than 
three sex partners during the year 
in general health officials recommend that people use condoms 
avoid anal sex and limit the number of sex partners to reduce the 
risk of aids

households across the nation will receive 
census forms in the mail starting friday as the head count shifts 
its focus from the homeless to the rest of the us population 
the most ambitious effort ever to count the homeless wound up 
early wednesday with census bureau director barbara everett bryant 
proclaiming success 
we can now move on to the rest of america she said urging 
people to complete their census forms and send them back promptly 
nearly 85 million census forms already have been trucked to bulk 
distribution centers of the us postal service they will go into 
the hands of letter carriers friday for delivery to homes 
nationwide 
forms will be stuffed in mailboxes or held with other mail but 
they will not be forwarded to people who have moved 
people who havent received a form by april 2 are being asked to 
call the census bureau which will send out a worker known as an 
enumerator to make sure they get counted the number to call is 
18009991990 
census day is april 1 and the bureau wants people to fill out 
the forms to show their residence and family situation as of that 
day 
just getting the material delivered and returned through the 
mail is costing nearly 44 million in postage a fraction of the 
estimated 25 billion overall cost of the head count 
with the nations population at about 250 million that amounts 
to 10 each in fact since the actual count is done only every 10 
years bureau officials like to say it averages out to only 1 a 
year for each american 
millions will be saved if the forms are returned promptly 
because that will save census takers from having to visit those 
people a more expensive undertaking 
census workers will have to visit lots of homes in any case 
while commercial address lists were purchased covering about 85 
million homes there are nearly 100 million residences in the 
country there were no good accurate mailing lists for the other 
15 million 
that means census takers will have to visit those places 
largely in rural areas such as hollows in west virginia isolated 
communities in alaska and lonely ranches in the west 
to collect the mass of material the bureau is hiring 480000 
temporary employees and they wont be deskbound bureaucrats 
because the agency bought them only 68000 desks and 75000 chairs 
the workers will use 9360000 pencils to process census forms 
that consumed 5000 tons of paper and 2700 pounds of ink in 
printing 
the forms will be shredded pulped and recycled after the 
information has been obtained although microfilm copies will be 
maintained for future reference 
information on any individual remains secret for 72 years after 
which the microfilm goes to the national archives and is available 
to historians and to people researching ancestors 
once the counting of heads is done the processing of data has 
just begun 
analysis of the information obtained in the census will take 
years plans currently call for publication of as many as 900 
different reports over that time 
they will be printed on paper released on compact discs tapes 
diskettes and microfilm producing the equivalent of 420000 pages 
of information 
thats a bit more than the first census in 1790 which was 
complete in 56 pages

senate democrats are outlining a new 2 
billion aid package for eastern europe far more than president 
bush wants to spend and several times what democrats themselves 
proposed just two months ago 
the draft bill escalates a democratic argument that bush has 
been too timid in aiding the emerging democracies and establishing 
a foothold for us companies in their newly free economies 
the bill by sens claiborne pell dri and joseph r biden 
ddel includes a 12 billion us share in a european bank for 
reconstruction and development proposed by france to finance 
public works and new private enterprises in former communist 
economies 
a copy of the draft was obtained wednesday by the associated 
press 
the administration has conditioned us participation in the 
bank on it refusal to lend for government projects or private 
ventures in the soviet union 
but treasury secretary nicholas brady and other administration 
officials acknowledge that the bank with commitments already from 
most western european countries and japan is going forward with or 
without a us role 
our economic competitors are racing to establish strong 
footings in eastern europe biden said wednesday we took a 
stutter step in the wrong direction when the bank was being set 
up and we lost our influence 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said the 
administrations actions threaten to lock us companies out of 
billions of dollars in new exports and technical aid that the bank 
will be financing 
its a brand new world and unless we throw off old ways of 
thinking rooted in cold war mentality we risk being left behind 
gephardt told a house foreign affairs subcommittee wednesday 
the new bill by pell chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee and biden who chairs the panels subcommittee on 
international economics and trade is four times the 511 million 
in new aid they proposed just two months ago 
the administration has proposed 300 million in new aid in 
fiscal 1991 for eastern europe beyond the 738 million that 
congress set aside last year for helping poland and hungary through 
1992 
administration officials have said any more money could not be 
absorbed by the eastern european economies without being wasted 
businesses are waiting for the government to go first and 
cover risks in the region and the government is waiting for 
business leaders to go in on their own biden complained what 
were lacking is the vision to develop programs that transform our 
military presence in europe to a political and economic presence 
the bill would give the administration flexibility in dividing 
the aid among czechoslovakia east germany romania bulgaria and 
yugoslavia in addition to poland and hungary 
it would expand total aid to the seven countries to 275 
billion by the end of 1992 but does not say where the money would 
be found except for some food programs the measure does not 
specify how much is to go to each country 
on tuesday sens robert c byrd dwva and patrick j leahy 
dvermont proposed shifting some of the 800 million in new 
foreign aid that bush wants for nicaragua and panama to eastern 
europe 
while providing no direct aid to the soviet government the bill 
authorizes bush to extend aspects of the program to the soviet 
union if they promote us values there 
for example it would authorize the aflcio using 40 million 
in increased funds for the national endowment for democracy to 
help foster effective trade unions in the soviet union as it did 
with the solidarity movement in poland 
portions of a 44 million boost in peace corps spending in the 
region also could be used for teaching english to soviet citizens 
this is a penetration program not an aid program biden 
said the goal is to penetrate the soviet union with american 
values 
included is 200 million to create us business centers in the 
seven east european countries to give technical and other aid for 
helping american companies establish a foothold in their markets

forced marriages and prostitution rape and 
other violence against women arent acceptable here and shouldnt 
be tolerated by the united states anywhere human rights advocates 
say 
the widespread handsoff attitude about violence against women 
is often excused as awareness of cultural traditions rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo said at a congressional hearing 
wednesday 
just as racism is not an acceptable cultural tradition 
neither is violence against women she said 
mrs schroeder said the united states should use its persuasive 
abilities in the area of human rights to convince countries to obey 
their own laws 
some of the countries have laws against things that are common 
practice but they dont enforce them said mrs schroeder who 
cochairs the congressional caucus for womens issues 
beating and raping are not culture torture is not culture 
sexual surgery is not culture they are violence and they are 
violations of human rights the congresswoman told the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on human rights and international 
organizations 
the hearing was one in a series being held by subcommittee 
chairman gus yatron dpa on other governments actions on 
violence against women 
based on information from the state departments recently 
released human rights report and from independent sources it is 
clear that human rights violations targeted against women because 
of their gender is pervasive throughout every region of the 
world yatron said 
goler butcher of amnesty international said women prisoners 
often are victims of sexual violence by guards or other government 
representatives 
she said this socalled custodial rape has been documented by 
her organization in india the philippines lebanon turkey iran 
somalia zaire chile argentina before 1983 guatemala sri lanka 
el salvador burma pakistan and uganda 
in the peruvian andes in areas of conflict between government 
forces and insurrectionist guerrillas rape of women is 
widespread said butcher legal officials told amnesty 
international representatives visiting ayacucho province in 1986 
that rape was to be expected when troops are based in the rural 
areas they said it was natural and prosecutions could not be 
expected 
butcher said that even in the united states at the female high 
security unit of lexington federal prison in kentucky the women 
were subjected to repeated stripsearching which appeared to be in 
excess of security needs 
she told of a pregnant prisoner in el salvador who was tortured 
forced to stand for days with her hands tied over head and 
continually threatened with rape who gave premature birth to an 
infant who died after a month 
felice gaer executive director of the international league for 
human rights said us foreign policy has neglected womens rights 
she said the united states has fought against slavery but not 
against forced prostitution or the sex tourism business 
gaer questioned whether the right of women in other countries to 
appear in court or be witnesses on equal basis with men has been 
part of the us advocacy of fair trials in those countries 
the witnesses called for us ratification of an international 
treaty known as the convention on elimination of discrimination 
against women 
gaer said the united states should take an active role in 
implementing the treaty by seeking membership on the committee that 
supervises compliance of it 
she also recommended that trade sanctions be used against 
countries that violate us standards for the treatment of women

census workers thrown into a brutal world of 
human feces and drifts of broken wine bottles for their firstever 
tally of the homeless entered reluctantly and in some cases not 
at all 
no i dont want to come in one worker shouted at 5 am 
wednesday standing on the sidewalk with blank census forms in her 
hand 
she hollered up at a reporter in the dark hole of a missing 
thirdfloor window if it was daylight i might 
people slept inside the abandoned downtown hotel their grimy 
bare mattresses hugged the corners of rooms the lumps in the dark 
were barely distinguishable from other piles rags little gideon 
bibles rotted food human feces 
it stunk of urine 
groping a way out became a listening game of telling the soft 
crunch of flaked paint thick as potato chips on the floor from 
the sharper give of broken glass 
the census worker and her partner wouldnt come in 
instead an old man went out he crawled up over a refrigerator 
and through a basement window he wore two pairs of pants neither 
size the right one and two coats losing the white fluff of their 
insulation 
he was counted 
many werent even by the census bureaus own assessment in 
some cases homeless people avoided the census takers in others 
they were apparently overlooked 
in detroit census takers checked seedy hotels where homeless 
paid 12 a night for rooms and they passed over three of four 
major shelters in the citys warzonelike cass corridor 
sam hargrove waited all night for census takers at the salvation 
army harbor light shelter to come count the 55 men stretched out on 
cots within they didnt show 
kevin young waited at the detroit rescue mission two blocks away 
with nearly 130 homeless to be counted 
i guess im an optimist young said normally the homeless 
are the aspect that get left out 
he was sure somebody would come nobody did 
and nobody showed at the nearby neighborhood service 
organization walkin center where about 70 men were inside and 
another 10 slept on the foyer floor in a thick cloud of human smell 
the census bureau spent 27 million on the homeless count 
which it carried out between 6 pm tuesday and 8 am wednesday in 
every city with a population over 50000 the officials defended 
their effort and said it would provide a valuable snapshot of 
the state of the homeless 
but the count was an abstract thing to the five shivering men 
stomping their feet on a detroit side street they sounded angry 
this special census changed nothing they said 
ive been in these streets for 50 years i aint going to be 
counted you dont be counting me said joseph antonio carter jr 
he was tense police sirens sounded a few blocks away shadows 
of men passed in the vacant lot behind them one man slipped into 
the brush to sleep beneath a pile of cardboard others gathered at 
the corner in the fluorescent glow of an open liquor store 
carter pushed his hands deep inside his pockets shoulders 
hunched up against the cold the census takers would leave at dawn 
he would still be here 
they go home to their nice warm castles while were out here 
begging for crumbs carter said we got the same damn thing 
every night 
tonight tomorrow next week next week and the week after 
that said his friend fred aint that right 
right man 
tuesday was only another night in the streets 
isaac 23 and selling drugs since 12 didnt believe anyone 
really cared about a homeless count 
they want the homeless to think theyre getting the ball 
rolling he said i have heard so much is going to happen to 
help us it doesnt

fortyfour democrats helped republican leaders 
block a conservative senators resolution urging president bush to 
immediately recognize lithuania as independent from the soviet 
union 
the symbolic measure offered wednesday night by sen jesse 
helms rnc urged bush to swiftly name an ambassador to 
lithuania and to ask the breakaway government there to establish a 
diplomatic mission in the united states 
president bush speaking to reporters at a state dinner at the 
white house on wednesday night was asked if he felt reassured 
about how the soviets were handling the lithuanian situation 
i am only because they restated their views on peaceful 
resolution of the impasse the president said it is highly 
complicated im not suggesting its easy but i see no reason to 
question what theyve said 
earlier wednesday the white house reacted with concern to 
reports that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had ordered all 
arms confiscated in the rebellious republic 
helms offered his nonbinding sense of the senate resolution 
as an amendment to unrelated legislation before the chamber 
despite white house objections to the measure republican leader 
robert dole of kansas predicted it would pass 
it failed on a 5936 tally with 44 democrats resisting an 
effort to tweak the administration joining dole and 14 other 
republicans in voting against it twentyseven republicans and nine 
democrats voted for the resolution 
those who opposed the helms resolution were not opposing 
lithuanian independence but spoke against undermining bush the 
presidents reluctance to recognize the independence decree has 
been widely interpreted as an attempt not to sour relations with 
moscow at a time gorbachev faces a number of domestic political 
problems 
the matter should be left to the president sen john 
chafee rri said in support of dole 
all it can do is create mischief said sen dale bumpers of 
arkansas one of the democrats who helped defeat the proposal 
lithuanias parliament declared independence from the soviet 
union on march 11 and its fledgling government has been seeking 
recognition from other nations 
gorbachev however has declared the independence decree 
illegal though gorbachev has said he would not use force soviet 
troops have been conducting exercises in the area and gorbachev on 
wednesday ordered lithuanians to turn in their firearms 
the white house has urged the soviet union not to use force 
against the lithuanian people and says it is closely monitoring 
developments there 
lithuania was one of the provinces of the russian czar before 
the 1917 bolshevik revolution it was able to establish its 
independence along with the neighboring baltic states of estonia 
and latvia in the turmoil that followed the revolution it 
maintained its independence until the soviet army invaded the 
country in 1940 and attached it to the soviet union 
the united states never withdrew diplomatic recognition from the 
1940 government the white house has declined to recognize the 
current government although it has urged moscow to negotiate with 
the lithuanian people

the bush administration opposes federal 
censorship of artworks that are subsidized by tax dollars the head 
of the government arts agency says 
federal art subsidies were intended to be free of political or 
cultural or contentbased restrictions john e frohnmeyer 
chairman of the national endowment for the arts told a 
congressional panel wednesday 
that is why the administrations request to continue the nea in 
business for five more years contains no such restrictions said 
frohnmayer who has headed the agency since october 
he told the house education and labor subcommittee on 
postsecondary education that the restrictions were absent when the 
arts endowment was created in 1965 and should stay out 
but the nea came under close scrutiny last year after it funded 
a pair of controversial exhibits depicting work that could be 
considered sacrilegious or obscene 
conservative lawmakers as a result succeeded in amending the 
1990 funding bill for the nea by ordering the head of the agency to 
deny funding to work that depicts sadomasochism homoeroticism 
the sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex 
acts 
the nea was told to review its evaluation process as well in 
the meantime sen jesse helms rnc and other critics contend 
that the endowment has continued to finance art that violates those 
standards 
helms asked the congressional general accounting office to 
investigate whether the nea is financing pornographic art 
in requesting the probe helms said frohnmayer may be sincere in 
saying no nea funds are being used to support obscene art 
but the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is 
imperative that there be an objective investigation by an agency 
independent of the nea the senator wrote 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif recently complained about an 
art exhibit in illinois that included a painting of jesus christ 
injecting himself with heroin 
frohnmayer said the nea is improving the system for evaluating 
grants the agency will develop a grid to assure that all 
geographic areas are represented and that as many cultures as 
possible are represented the makeup of the evaluation panels also 
will be diversified 
anne g murphy executive director of the american arts alliance 
said she was pleased by frohnmeyers comments opposing censorship 
but was cautious about whether the administration will succeed in 
keeping nea free of restrictions 
i think its a first step in what is going to be a prolonged 
debate over the next six weeks she said 
rohrabacher said the legislative proposal ignores mainstream 
values 
if he means by no content restrictions that nea will continue 
to fund art that attacks religion or is so sexually graphic that it 
is contrary to the moral standards of the people i think hes 
forgetting the american people are his boss and not certain people 
in the arts community rohrabacher said 
we feel that the national endowment for the arts is completely 
out of control said a statement from the eagle forum a 
conservative group that wants to end nea funding 
defenders of the nea say only 10 images out of 1 million in 
the agencys history have generated controversy put another way 
they say 25 grants out of 85000 have caused trouble just a 
fraction of a cent for each taxpayer 
its a small amount but its a big principle rohrabacher 
countered

experts are still unsure whether oatmeal will 
make you live longer but a new study suggests that to do much 
good youll have to eat an awful lot of it 
in theory at least the watersoluble fiber in oatmeal oat 
bran psyllium and some other foods will lower the bodys 
cholesterol levels 
this idea catapulted oat bran to become one of the hottest food 
crazes of the 1980s as bakers and brewers offered oat bran 
doughnuts oat bran potato chips even oat bran beer 
but even if it might do some good a new study suggests that the 
often mimuscule amount of oat bran in many of these products is 
probably worthless 
the latest study found that to noticably lower their 
cholesterol people had to eat two bowls of oat bran or three bowls 
of oatmeal each day 
and although their cholesterol levels dropped while eating this 
much cereal the study left open the possibility that they might 
have benefitted simply because they were too full to eat bacon 
sausages and other highfat foods 
whether its fat substitution or not oat bran or oatmeal 
appears to lower cholesterol said dr michael davidson of rush 
medical college in chicago 
oat brans apparent powers were challenged recently by a study 
conducted at brigham and womens hospital in boston it found that 
lowfiber wheat flour lowered cholesterol just as much as oat bran 
and both apparently worked because people ate less fat 
in the latest study conducted on 140 people the chicago 
researchers directed by davidson found that those who eat two bowls 
of oat bran lower their cholesterol levels more than 9 percent 
three bowls of oatmeal seem to reduce it 7 percent 
however it was unclear how much the volunteers changed other 
parts of their diet to offset their high daily consumption of 
cereal 
dr richard pasternak of bostons beth israel hospital said the 
oat bran controversy continues we are still asking does it or 
doesnt it 
davidsons study was presented wednesday at a meeting of the 
american college of cardiology along with a study of psyllium 
conducted by dr eleanor g levin of kaiser permanente medical 
group in santa clara calif 
she found that the psylliumrich laxative metamucil taken twice 
a day seems to modestly lower cholesterol even if people are 
already eating lowfat food 
i think its an excellent adjunct to a prudent diet she 
said 
levin a cardiologist conducted the work while at george 
washington university medical center in washington 
in her study 58 volunteers were randomly chosen to use either 
metamucil or identicallooking packets of unsoluble fiber but 
before they started they went on the american heart association 
diet and lowered their fat consumption to 25 percent of their daily 
calories this alone dropped their cholesterol levels 40 to 50 
points 
when they began using the powders which are dissolved in water 
their cholesterol levels were still above 200 the amount 
considered to be safe over 16 weeks the cholesterol levels of 
those using metamucil dropped almost 6 percent while those of the 
comparison group were unchanged 
with a little of this a lot of people can avoid taking toxic 
medications to bring down their cholesterol levin said i 
recommend it to all of my patients 
dr thomas kottke of the mayo clinic said the latest study 
appeared to be well conducted 
unless there are nonobvious holes it seems to be a 
reasonable conclusion he said 
one drawback of using metamucil and other kinds of fiber is 
their effects on the digestive tract in levins study 
participants complained of flatulence and loose stools 
it takes getting use to she said

the risk of strokes resulting from irregular 
heart beats which strike 75000 americans annually can be cut in 
half simply by taking a single aspirin tablet each day according 
to a study published today 
these strokes are triggered by extremely rapid beating of the 
atria the hearts upper chambers a condition called atrial 
fibrillation about 12 million have this abnormality and until 
now most have gone untreated 
the researchers said they were amazed to find that aspirin 
already widely recommended to prevent heart attacks can keep 
people from getting this form of stroke 
we are talking about a condition that probably causes 200 
strokes a day this is an important piece of news when you realize 
that they may be prevented by something as simple as a daily 
aspirin said a coauthor of the study dr jonathan l halperin 
of mount sinai medical center in new york 
the strokes result when blood clots form inside the rapidly 
beating heart chamber if they move into the bloodstream they can 
travel to the brain choking off the supply of blood 
until now the only way to prevent these kinds of strokes was 
regular use of the drug warfarin a blood thinner that is a common 
ingredient of rat poison 
although often used for severe atrial fibrillation caused by 
damaged heart valves many doctors are reluctant to prescribe the 
medicine for milder cases because of the possibility of severe 
bleeding 
we need to change policy about how to treat this common 
condition we have found something substantial said another 
coauthor dr david c anderson of hennepin county medical center 
in minneapolis 
a stroke specialist who did not participate in the study said 
the results mean that aspirin may be an alternative for people who 
cannot take warfarin but dr louis caplan of new england medical 
center cautioned 
the actual amount of the effect and whether it is superior to 
warfarin and in which patients are unclear 
the aspirin findings were based on a comparison study conducted 
on 1244 people at 17 medical centers across the united states a 
preliminary report was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
earlier studies have suggested that aspirin can block the 
formation of blood clots in the coronary arteries that feed the 
heart muscle but the clumps of blood that form inside the atria 
were thought to result from a different clotting mechanism 
there has never been a shred of evidence to suggest that 
aspirin would be effective at preventing blood clots in the 
chambers of the heart itself said halperin its amazing that 
aspirin was able to reduce the incidence of stroke in these 
patients it was unpredicted and unexpected 
about 15 percent of the 500000 strokes in the united states 
each year occur in people with atrial fibrillation experts say 
these strokes are often particularly damaging 
in the study people were randomly assigned to take aspirin 
warfarin or dummy placebos the placebo part of the study was 
stopped after a year because of a striking reduction in risk among 
those getting either aspirin or warfarin 
the study found that 3 percent of those taking aspirin suffered 
either strokes or blockages in the blood supply to other parts of 
the body compared with 6 percent in the placebo group 
although some fear that aspirin use may cause strokes resulting 
from uncontrolled bleeding in the brain there was no increased 
risk of this in those taking aspirin in the latest study 
the study will continue for at least 18 months to determine 
whether aspirin or warfarin works better

small physical differences inside the brain may 
help explain why some people are afflicted with the severe mental 
illness of schizophrenia a study says today 
several earlier studies have described what appear to be 
differences in the brains of schizophrenics but because the 
abnormalities were so slight experts were uncertain whether they 
truly were unique to people with the mental disorder 
the latest work tried to settle this question by comparing the 
brains of 15 sets of identical twins in each pair one twin had 
schizophrenia the other did not 
the chief finding of this study was that evidence of 
anatomical changes in the brain was present in almost every twin 
with schizophrenia the researchers wrote 
the differences were subtle but in general the hollow spaces 
in the brain known as the cerebral ventricles were larger in the 
schizophrenics heads and the hippocampus a part of the brain 
vital to memory was smaller 
just how these differences are related to schizophrenia is 
unclear indeed scientists are unsure whether they might cause the 
disease or somehow result from it 
the latest findings were based on magnetic scans that take 
crosssectional pictures on the head the work conducted by dr 
richard l suddath and others from the national institute of mental 
health in washington was published in todays new england journal 
of medicine 
schizophrenia runs in families but the new research suggests 
that the cause may not be entirely genetic because the twins are 
genetically identical 
in an accompanying editorial dr m marsel mesulam of beth 
israel hospital in boston said the latest work provides nearly 
definitive evidence of structural differences in schizophrenics 
brains 
people with schizophrenia have disturbances in thinking 
feelings and behavior often they make disconnected remarks 
believe they hear voices and complain that others are stealing 
their thoughts

a study today confirms that adding fish oil to 
diet appears to lower blood pressure a bit but the benefits 
disappear if people are already getting lots of fish in their daily 
fare 
the study conducted on 156 men and women in norway is the 
latest to delve into the claims of fish oils apparent benefits on 
the heart and circulatory system it found that when people took 
six grams of fish oil capsules a day their blood pressure fell 
about 3 percent 
the results of this populationbased intervention study 
demonstrate that polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil lower 
blood pressure in subjects with hypertension the researchers 
wrote 
the study conducted by dr kaare h bonaa and colleagues at the 
university of tromso was published in todays new england journal 
of medicine 
the results were similar to a smaller study reported last year 
by a team at vanderbilt university 
in the latest study the volunteers blood pressures averaged 
about 144 over 95 when the project began after 10 weeks of taking 
fish oil besides their usual meals the first number the systolic 
blood pressure fell five points and the second number the 
diastolic pressure dropped three points 
however the fish oil did nothing for people who were already 
eating fish three or more times a week a comparison group took 
corn oil supplements and their blood pressures did not change 
either

mikhail s gorbachev has forsworn the use of tanks 
and troops to halt lithuanias drive for independence but the 
soviet president is not above using psychological weapons 
gorbachev on wednesday ordered the people of the breakaway 
baltic republic to turn in all of their firearms within a week 
he also instructed kgb border guards to tighten their watch over 
the republic and told officials to reduce the number of visas 
issued to foreigners seeking to visit the republic 
the lithuanians declared themselves independent on march 11 and 
thus dont consider gorbachev their president 
gorbachev repeatedly has said that under his reform policies 
moscow no longer will use muscle to keep restive republics in the 
soviet fold 
on tuesday foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze assured 
secretary of state james a baker iii that moscow will not use 
force in the baltic republics this is what ive been saying all 
the time 
using his strenghtened presidential powers gorbachev has been 
gradually stepping up pressure on lithuania which this week began 
establishing its own border guard 
wednesdays directive was the third move in less than a week to 
try to prevent lithuania from effectively establishing an 
independent government and economy 
on friday gorbachev gave the lithuanian leadership three days 
to renounce their secessionist move on monday the soviet 
government declared lithuania may not open its own customs posts 
take over factories owned by moscow ministries or issue its own 
currency 
over the weekend the soviet military staged unannounced 
maneuvers in and around lithuania 
lithuanians nevertheless remained defiant figuring gorbachev 
had no intention of taking military action but was instead seeking 
to strengthen his hand for eventual bargaining on the terms of 
secession 
in the six months leading up to lithuanians declaration of 
independence gorbachev tried reasoning cajoling and even staking 
his personal prestige with a visit to lithuania in an effort to 
halt the drive for independence 
each approach failed 
immediately after lithuania declared it had restored the 
independence lsot for forcible annexation in 1940 gorbachev said 
the issue would have to be settled by talks 
he called lithuanias move illegal and invalid and the 
soviet congress of peoples deputies authorized him to use his 
presidential powers to bring lithuania back in line 
gorbachev initially showed great reluctance to use force to 
quell ethnic violence in the caucasus republics of armenia and 
azerbaijan 
but two months ago he sent soldiers into the azerbaijan capital 
of baku to halt a series of attacks that left dozens of ethnic 
armenians dead 
in contrast with the caucasus lithuanias independence drive 
has been peaceful

severe nausea among people taking the common 
anticancer drug cisplatin can be largely controlled by an 
experimental new medicine research released today says 
two studies show that the medicine called ondansetron 
dramatically reduces episodes of vomiting and nausea that persists 
is much less intense 
although many cancer medicines can cause nausea cisplatin is 
considered to be the worst the bouts can be so severe that some 
patients refuse to continue with treatment that could cure them 
cisplatin is widely used to treat cancers of the ovaries 
testicles bladder head and neck 
two comparison studies on the new treatment were published in 
todays new england journal of medicine 
in one study dr luigi x cubeddu of the university of north 
carolina working with researchers in venezuela tested the 
medicine on 28 cancer patients half received ondansetron and the 
rest got inactive saline injections 
eleven of the patients getting ondansetron had two or fewer 
vomiting episodes in the 24 hours after their chemotherapy and 13 
of those in the comparison group had four or more 
we conclude that ondansetron is an effective and safe agent 
for controlling nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin 
treatment the doctors wrote 
in the other study a french team headed by dr michel marty of 
st louis hospital in paris compared ondansetron with 
metoclopramide another antinausea medicine in a study with 76 
patients they found that ondansetron was about twice as effective 
in an accompanying editorial dr steven m grunberg of the 
university of southern california said that ondansetron appears to 
be valuable adding 
we have made great progress since the time when aggressive 
sedation was the only treatment for chemotherapyinduced vomiting 
we still have a long way to go 
ondanstron has already been approved for routine use in great 
britain and france its maker glaxo has applied to the food and 
drug administration for approval to sell it in the united states

prison authorities say a convicted burglar 
swapped clothes with his visiting twin brother and escaped 
leaving the brother behind and in trouble with the law 
prison officers did not realize the wrong man was back in the 
cells until an inmate pointed out a telltale tattoo 
the 19yearold twins both have their christian names tattooed 
on their necks 
they managed to switch clothes tuesday in a busy visiting area 
at cardiff prison allowing anthony litton to escape 
now terry litton is behind bars accused of helping his brother 
escape cardiff magistrates refused an application for bail and 
ordered to appear in court again next week 
the twins have always been pranksters but this time they 
have gone too far the police wont see the funny side of it 
said their father ken 45 of rhondda mid glamorgan 
it is an embarrassing situation said prison governor alan 
rawlson who launched an immediate investigation into the mixup 
it is a very big room and at visiting time it is very busy 
although no part of it is actually out of sight of the officers 
anthony litton serving a twoyear sentence for burglary had 
donned his brothers green bomber jacket checked shirt and jeans 
before leaving the jail with relatives who were visiting other 
prisoners 
as well as tony on the right side of his neck he has 
mushrooms and a black widow spider tattooed on his forearms 
the twins father said we just cant understand why tony 
wanted to escape because he is due for parole soon 
their mother ann 40 added in school they had to wear name 
tags which they were always switching to confuse the teacher 
i reckon the decision to escape must have been made on the 
spur of the moment i really hope all this doesnt land them both 
in too much trouble

failed to rise beyond the 30000point mark while the dollar 
closed sharply higher against the yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average was down 96385 points or 
313 percent ending a hectic day at 2984385 after losing 
183605 points or 596 percent to bottom out at 2897112 at the 
end of the morning session the index recouped more than 870 points 
in afternoon trading 
the dollar closed at 15483 yen up 118 yen from tuesdays 
close at 15365 yen the currency opened at 15450 yen and ranged 
between 1545015545 yen 
dealers attributed the indexs afternoon recovery to 
largescale computerlinked arbitrage buyings in which investors 
sold futures and bought spot issues in an attempt to take profits 
from price gaps between the two markets 
the tokyo stock market has fallen more than 20 percent since the 
start of the year including 27731 points in three trading days 
this week there was no trading wednesday due to a national holiday 
in japan 
afternoon trading was more active than the earlier session 
which was sober and subdued as the rush of sell orders met with 
virually no buyers 
traders estimated the first section volume at 580 million 
shares compared to 180 million changed hands during morning 
trading 
massive selling that sent the markets key index below the 
29000point mark came mainly from institutional investors dealers 
said 
kazuto aizawa a trader with nippon kangyo kakumaru securities 
co said many market players were discouraged by the yens 
weakness despite the bank of japans 1 percentage point discount 
rate hike earlier in the week 
also institutional investors were selling to offset losses 
ahead of closing their books for the fiscal year at the end of 
march he said 
aizawa said he could not foresee a recovery in the market 
unless the government takes some measure because the loss is so 
big 
currency dealers said the dollars surge followed a strong 
showing in new york where multiple factors including escalating 
tensions in the soviet republic of lithuania were said to have 
contributed to the us currencys strength 
lithuania declared its independence from the soviet union on 
march 11 but the soviets have termed the move illegal soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev wednesday ordered lithuanians to turn 
in their weapons 
investors often regard the dollar as a safe haven in times of 
international tension 
a dealer with the bank of tokyo said many currency market 
players had anticipated tuesdays action by japans central bank to 
raise its official discount rate by a full percentage point to 525 
percent

scientists said today that a key natural process 
could not have produced the global warming of the past 100 years by 
itself supporting the idea that the greenhouse effect is already 
raising global temperatures 
only about threefifths of that warming could have come from a 
natural longterm influence of the oceans the researchers 
computer simulation suggests 
the result is presented in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by tml wigley and scb raper of the university of east 
anglia in norwich england 
they said the result does not prove that greenhouse warming has 
begun other scientists agreed but split on how strongly the 
result bolsters the idea 
the greenhouse effect refers to a warming caused by a buildup in 
the atmosphere of certain gases such as carbon dioxide chiefly 
from human activity scientists are concerned that it could 
eventually alter climates and rainfall patterns and lead to coastal 
flooding from raised ocean levels 
but they disagree on whether the greenhouse effect has yet 
produced any detectable impact 
the earth has warmed by about ninetenths of a degree fahrenheit 
over the past 100 years 
a major problem in demonstrating a role for the greenhouse 
effect is that scientists do not know how much of the warming comes 
from longterm natural variability said gerald meehl of the 
national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo 
the oceans which slowly absorb and release huge amounts of 
heat are probably the most likely source of this longterm 
influence he said 
the simulation reported in the nature paper found that over 
intervals of up to 100 years the oceans might produce a trend of 
up to about half a degree fahrenheit 
that means the ocean influence could not have produced the 
observed global warming by itself the researchers wrote yet we 
still cannot claim to have unequivocally detected the greenhouse 
effect they said 
researcher robert cess said the study cannot rule out the idea 
that the oceans did produce the global warming the simulation was 
too simplified to produce a firm conclusion said cess an 
atmospheric sciences professor at the state university of new york 
at stony brook 
but researcher stephen schneider of the atmospheric research 
center who called himself 80 percent certain that greenhouse 
warming has begun said the result adds to his belief 
its not proof yet he said but its another step along 
the way 
scientists will need another 10 years to 20 years of 
observations to be sure if they are seeing a greenhouse warming he 
said

an advocacy group is suing the maker of an 
allegedly defective heart valve that has been implanted in the 
chests of more than 80000 people 
public citizen said wednesday its suit seeks to require shiley 
inc and its parent company pfizer inc to notify all those who 
have had the valve implanted about alleged defects and possible 
lifethreatening consequences if it fails 
the suit also asks that the companies pay for psychological 
counseling and medical consultation to advise these people of the 
risks and benefits of having the valve removed the symptoms of 
valve failure and emergency steps to be taken if those symptoms 
occur 
the group founded by consumer activist ralph nader filed the 
lawsuit in los angeles county superior court shileys principal 
offices are in california 
pfizer based in new york said the suit is completely without 
merit and will frighten cardiac patients unnecessarily and 
ultimately do much more harm than good 
pfizer said the valves have saved the lives of tens of 
thousands of patients all but a small fraction of 1 percent of 
these valves continue to function properly 
the food and drug administration approved the valve in april 
1979 but after reports of malfunctions shiley removed it from the 
market in november 1986 
the company has reported to the fda nearly 400 failures of the 
valve 248 of which resulted in death

industry where there are high incidences of repetitive strain 
injuries 
osha originally proposed 43 million in fines against morrell 
for exposing workers at its sioux falls sd plant to hazards 
that produced cumulative trauma disorders or repetitive motion 
injuries 
under wednesdays settlement which was also worked out with the 
united food and commercial workers union morrell will pay a 
990000 fine and provide a grant of 260000 to the national

the flow of illegal immigration across the 
southwest border appears to be increasing dramatically reversing a 
threeyear downturn that began when the federal government made it 
illegal to hire undocumented workers 
verne jervis a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization 
service said a surge in apprehensions of illegal aliens 
considered to be the best available indicator of illegal 
immigration began in may 1989 and has continued steadily 
according to the ins figures apprehensions of illegal aliens 
were up 299 percent over the past 10 months compared with the 
same period a year ago apprehensions totaled 801937 between may 
1989 and february 1990 compared with 617317 apprehensions between 
may 1988 and february 1989 
some months recorded surges of nearly 60 percent while in other 
months the increases dropped below 20 percent but the past three 
months have been among the highest with apprehensions rising 573 
percent between february 1989 and february 1990 by 396 percent 
between january 1989 and january 1990 and by 583 between december 
1988 and december 1989 
apprehensions began dropping sharply in fiscal 1987 the first 
year after congress passed the immigration control and reform act 
of 1986 which made employers subject to civil and criminal 
sanctions for hiring undocumented workers 
although the trend in apprehensions continued downward through 
the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the first six months of 
this fiscal year have seen an increase in apprehensions of 37 
percent over the same period a year ago 
jervis said the rise in illegal immigration may be due to the 
availability of fraudulent documents that undocumented workers use 
to obtain work or simply the desperation of some in mexico to 
seek work here

yves saint laurent had a winning through 
abbreviated winter readytowear show winding up a big week of 
fashion in elegant paris style 
while the 53yearold king of fashion was recovering in a 
hospital from exhaustion the collection displayed wednesday still 
sparkled with his verve and talent 
assistants from the house would say only that he worked on the 
collection until last saturday and now his doctor has prescribed a 
long rest 
the clothes had the inimitable saint laurent touch many of the 
current trends shown around town were saint laurents own 
inventions and his latest versions were replayed in a modern key 
the exuberantly flowered folklore reminded the audience that 
saint laurent started the rich peasant styles now seen on runways 
back in 1976 his blackpiped quilted cotton jackets or flounced 
flareaway coats were updated with a casual appeal for the 1990s 
saint laurent also brought out some gorgeous multicolored 
harlequin blouses and sexily fitted velvet jackets with elaborate 
embroidered appliques over full print short skirts with ruffled 
underskirts 
then the pace changed with quietly sleek mantailored taupe or 
grey gabardine trouser or skirt suits as only saint laurent can do 
them giving feminine touches like dripping rhinestone brooches and 
gold lame gloves 
a new ysl couture accessory shop opens today at 32 rue du 
faubourg sainthonore to offer such goodies as well as bags and 
scarves for couture prices with bracelets starting around 250 
saint laurent also took his fashions on a worldwide trip that 
included a visit to the scottish moors with the most wonderful new 
draped tartan kilts and tam oshanters with dashing pheasant 
feathers 
there were tyrolian maids in spiffy tweed suits with sparkling 
buttons and velvet lapels superb boleros decorated with big bands 
of colorful rickrack and excellent hooded duffel coats 
the most original duffel was in robins egg blue over a 
pullover in pastel and white norwegian motifs with stars topping 
straight gray flannel pants gathered at the waist 
like just about every other designer saint laurent was inspired 
by safari country if you have a yen for a wildanimal print look 
to ysl his are absolutely extraordinary big patchwork patterns 
in leopard spots and blackcream tachiste daubs on the lightest 
chiffons caressing the body in sexy puffs sashes ruffles and 
wraps 
the glory of the show was that it offered something for 
everybody from the sporting set to the showy cocktail crowd with 
all lengths of skirt and several cuts of pants 
for those who like minis with a wink at the 1960s saint laurent 
brought out some great modern suede knee or thighhigh boots some 
with passementeriebanded tops 
saint laurents lingerieinspired clothes included black lace 
minicamisoles topped by belted puffs of organza in hot colors

a povertystricken widow can keep the small home 
her husband helped build for her 42 years ago a lending company 
has decided 
transamerica financial services inc which hired one of the 
states biggest law firms to try to seize lennie williams home 
earlier this year gave up its fight wednesday lawyers for both 
sides said 
company officials did not return calls seeking comment and 
their phoenix law firm declined to discuss details of the case 
without the companys permission 
the womans lawyers attributed the settlement proposal to 
publicity stemming from an associated press report about her case 
mrs williamss mental state prevented her from understanding 
much of the legal battle that surrounded her home but she knew 
enough at times to worry that someone was after it according to 
her attorneys 
she was just completely relieved when we finally were able to 
get it through to her that she was never going to have to worry 
about someone taking her house again attorney douglas erickson 
said wednesday the property is free and clear 
mrs williams who supports herself on 438 a month doesnt 
remember that her husband died 12 years ago or that she put up the 
house in a workingclass phoenix neighborhood as security for a 
loan taken out by her former soninlaw in 1987 
the transamerica loan officer who handled the transaction says 
he doubts mrs williams knew what she was doing the soninlaw has 
disappeared 
others who knew mrs williams at the time including a state 
lawmaker and a doctor who was treating her also have said they 
doubted her competence and maricopa county superior court judge 
alfred rogers ruled earlier this year that it appeared the company 
knew or should have known that mrs williams was incompetent 
and was being defrauded 
transamerica was not persuaded it pressed for trial and 
demanded that mrs williams make 499amonth payments even though 
rogers was blocking the company from going ahead with foreclosure 
on the home 
mrs williams and her legal guardian filed the suit to block the 
company a subsidiary of san franciscobased transamerica corp 
from foreclosing the suit also sought to void her part of the 
contract and win damages 
the case had drawn extensive publicity in the southwest after an 
associated press story was published in area newspapers a national 
television program inside edition sent a crew to interview 
mrs williams on wednesday 
one of transamericas attorneys robert miles said earlier this 
month that the company believed it was entitled to the property 
a second lawyer tom canham said wednesday that the company had 
now determined it would be better to settle the case and that 
agreement not to seek foreclosure was part of an overall package 
the case was the latest in a series involving consumerloan 
companies and it came at a time when the collapse of many thrifts 
has forced more middleclass borrowers to turn to them 
in arizona alone itt financial services paid 17 million to 
settle one classaction lawsuit and household finance corp paid 
about 4 million to settle another transamerica financial services 
has already offered to pay about 4 million to settle a 
classaction lawsuit that accuses it of gouging poor and 
middleincome borrowers 
loanindustry lobbyists have said mrs williams case must be an 
aberration 
but bill morris director of litigation at southern arizona 
legal aid in tucson and chief architect of the classaction suits 
said the situation is believed to occur frequently 
the 32000 loan that mrs williams signed for carried an 
interest rate of nearly 18 percent plus 8 points in prepaid charges 
and called for total payments of 89820 or 499 a month over 15 
years her home which is less than 1000 square feet and which her 
husband helped build for her 42 years ago in a workingclass 
neighborhood was appraised at 40000 
sworn testimony shows it was mrs williams soninlaw william 
smith who wanted the money in the first place 
smith had married mrs williams daughter alma but hadnt 
lived with her for years said rachel freeman mrs williams 
greatniece and legal guardian 
alma died early in 1987 months later smith came around and 
promised he would help fix mrs williams home according to ms 
freeman 
instead he allegedly took her to transamerica had her cosign 
a 32000 loan and disappeared mrs williams attorneys have 
obtained a judgment against him but its of little value since 
they dont know where he is

portauprince haiti ap in attacks political and civic 
leaders blame on thugs angered by the shift from army to civilian 
rule marauding gunmen have killed at least 19 people this week 
officials and radio reports say 
the victims included 11 members of a selfdefense group hacked 
to death in the town of petit goave the birthplace of nationwide 
demonstrations that forced lt gen prosper avril from power 
in the capital of portauprince wednesday assailants killed at 
least four people and wounded eight according to the reports the 
wounded included five members of a selfdefense unit shot by gunmen 
in speeding cars 
the unity assembly the political and civic coalition that chose 
provisional president ertha pascaltrouillot after avril went into 
exile last week has urged the formation of selfdefense units 
there has been a dearth of police protection since avril fled 
the unity assembly said thugs and members of the 
illdisciplined 6000man army the traditional power broker in 
this impoverished caribbean nation are angry at the militarys 
surrender of power to civilians 
these acts of urban terrorism have been committed by 
irreconcilable supporters of dictatorship politician rockefeller 
guerre said wednesday others said the attacks were aimed at 
destabilizing the civilian government

marxist guerrillas claimed responsibility 
for the attempted assassination of a retired air force chief who 
helped lead the 1973 overthrow of leftist president salvador 
allende 
the shooting of gustavo leigh and a business partner wednesday 
was the first political attack since an elected civilian 
government replaced gen augusto pinochet after 16 years of 
rightwing military rule 
cabinet ministers military officials and the roman catholic 
church condemned the shooting and swore not to let it or threats of 
future attacks weaken the democracy that was reborn 11 days ago 
witnesses said two young men with handguns burst into the 
fourthfloor offices of a real estate company run by leigh and 
another retired air force general enrique ruiz in santiagos 
wealthy providencia neighborhood 
the two fired pointblank at leigh and ruiz then fled police 
said 
leigh 69 was hit in the face chest stomach and both arms a 
hospital report said late wednesday the hospital said he lost an 
eye and was conscious in critical but stable condition after five 
hours of surgery 
ruiz was reported in serious condition 
in telephone calls to local radio stations a spokeswoman for a 
maverick faction of the procommunist manuel rodriguez patriotic 
front chiles main guerrilla organization claimed responsibility 
the spokeswoman who uses the name mariela vargas called leigh 
one of the cruelest ideologues behind the thousands of killings 
committed during the dictatorship she termed ruiz an 
accomplice 
she warned of future attacks we will continue to exercise 
our right to popular justice 
leigh commanded the air force during the bloody september 1973 
coup directing warplanes to bomb the presidential palace where 
allende was holed up the elected civilian president a marxist 
died in the coup 
leigh part of the subsequent fourman military junta led by 
pinochet declared the militarys mission was to cut out the 
marxist cancer from chilean society the armed forces began a 
harsh campaign of antileftist repression 
pinochet fired leigh in june 1978 after a series of policy 
disagreements and leigh became a public critic of pinochet and his 
attempts to remain in power 
pinochet handed over power march 11 to an elected civilian 
successor president patricio aylwin a christian democrat backed 
by a coalition of centrist and leftist parties 
aylwin canceled scheduled activities wednesday to keep informed 
about developments following the shooting 
his interior minister enrique krauss called the shootings a 
cowardly attack and promised an intensive investigation 
education minister ricardo lagos said it was an attempt to 
destabilize the institutional order 
defense minister patricio rojas pledged no provocation will 
alter the democratic vocation of the chilean people or the 
stability that the government gives to democracy 
air force commander gen fernando matthei called it an attack 
against each and every member of the air force it doesnt 
contribute to the positive climate of the democratic process 
the attack came on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the 
chilean air force and the institution had suspended all training 
activities to celebrate the date

here is a text of lithuanian president 
vytautus landsbergis response to mikhail s gorbachevs order that 
lithuanians turn in their firearms it was issued in lithuanian and 
translated for the associated press by lithuanian officials 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this order like any other adopted by a foreign state that 
pretends to claim sovereignty over lithuania has no legal power 
it could be enforced only by brutal military force and if the 
soviet union is willing to prolong the aggression of 1940 against 
lithuania its a pity that it continues the mistake of the third 
congress of peoples deputies 
it amounts to the claiming of nonexistent and unjustified 
sovereignty of a powerful country over a small and unarmed 
neighbor the soviet union has recognized as null and void the 
secret protocol to the agreement between stalin and hitler 
condemned the policy of ultimatums and violation of international 
law including the annexation of lithuania but now once again is 
not able to give up the prize and restore justice 
the ghost of stalinism is walking in the kremlin and the shadow 
of it lies far to the west over lithuania tomorrow will show if 
the world which greets lithuania and her desire for freedom will 
approve well meet tomorrow serene and united as we were before 
facing previous threats

the collection of thousands of rare books 
and manuscripts worth up to 20 million seized from a home in 
southeastern iowa rivals many libraries a university curator said 
it was like walking into a very very good rarebook store 
said david schoonover curator of rare books at the university of 
iowa who was called in by the fbi to help with the investigation 
the homes owner stephen carrie blumberg 41 who lists his 
address as st paul minn was arrested at the house tuesday and 
charged with interstate transport of stolen property 
the fbi wednesday appealed to universities and libraries for 
help in locating the owners of the estimated 11000 publications 
seized from the 14room house in the community of ottumwa 
authorities valued the collection at 10 million to 20 million 
and said the antiquities included a bible published in 1568 
fbi agent dennis aiken said the items were stolen from 
universities and private collections across north america 
including harvard university the college of william and mary and 
the university of notre dame 
he said agents recovered a suitcase full of library stickers 
bearing the names of numerous colleges and universities 
blumberg has been under investigation by numerous law 
enforcement agencies for two years said aiken 
the basis of the search of the house was a complaint that 
manuscripts and books valued at 662000 were missing from the 
university of oregon in eugene according to a federal affidavit 
filed in des moines 
larry holmquist an fbi agent based in omaha neb said 
inquiries about missing books should be made in writing to charles 
lontor the senior agent in charge of the omaha fbi office 
the fbi said the items would be transferred to a warehouse in 
des moines for inventory and cataloging 
schoonover said wednesday hes unsure how many books were in the 
house or the total value 
i do believe whoever brought them to the house was very clever 
indeed schoonover said 
he said if the house in ottumwa were a library it would be 
considered a good one 
they the publications were in very good condition they were 
carefully arranged by subject and category of authors he said 
i was astounded at the range and quality and number of books

thousands of members of president 
carlos menems governing party stopped work and marched to 
congress accusing him of betraying his political roots by imposing 
a drastic antiinflation plan 
menem you cheated us get out read an 82footlong banner 
carried by employees of the state telephone company as about 60000 
people rallied outside congress on wednesday 
the peronist party candidate was elected in may with the support 
of organized labor after a campaign in which he made no mention of 
the painful austerity program 
the broad support of wednesdays strike which disrupted airline 
flights mail delivery classes and other public services 
indicated growing difficulties for menem to try to stop 12000 
percent inflation and more than four decades of economic decline 
today begins the first step in the struggle against the 
privatizations and socalled restructuring of the state saul 
ubaldini a leader of the general labor confederation told the 
crowd outside congress 
in trying to stop inflation menem has said he would sell the 
airline telephone railroad and many other moneylosing state 
companies that were nationalized or created beginning with the 
presidency of juan domingo peron in 1946 
menem betrayed us he betrayed the people and peronism said 
celina morturi 45 who works for the state gas company 
the strike was carried out peacefully by 22 unions that 
represent about 15 million state employees 
the leader of the 22union coordinating board victor de 
gennaro said we believe the peronist government should listen 
to the people whose support brought carlos menem to the 
presidency 
union leaders say the move to sell state enterprises along with 
spending cuts to balance the fiscal budget will throw tens of 
thousands of people out of work in an economy already beset by 
inflation recession and unemployment 
the rally and march took place on a warm first day of fall in 
this southern hemisphere nation of 32 million 
menem 59 tried to avoid the strike and an open break with 
organized labor by offering a modest increase in public wages and 
doubling retirement pensions to about 80 a month 
however he said tuesday they can stage a thousand strikes 
but the economic plan is totally irreversible 
government officials say they have no choice but to reduce the 
budget because the printing of money by the central bank to finance 
the deficit fuels inflation 
for years argentina financed the fiscal deficit by borrowing 
abroad but it can no longer do that because it stopped repaying 
its more than 60 billion foreign debt it also sold bonds to 
argentines who stopped buying them after the government froze 
withdrawals from savings accounts in january 
argentines wary of their currency which has lost 99 percent of 
its value in the past year have billions of us dollars in 
savings including an estimated 50 billion invested overseas 
uncertainty about the economy has raised fears that the military 
may again try to seize power something it has done six times since 
1930 
such fears were heightened further following the death tuesday 
of army chief gen isidro caceres after a heart attack caceres 
who was 55 had helped put down three mutinies since april 1987

a vietnamese youth who spent four years in prison 
after being illegally sentenced to 38 years in prison will be tried 
again on robbery charges dallas county prosecutors say 
the announcement wednesday came only a week after the texas 
court of criminal appeals ruled that luan van hoang had been 
illegally sentenced to an adult prison 
the prosecutors strategy potentially could expose the teenager 
to three life sentences in prison 
i think its appropriate that he be held accountable whether 
its in juvenile court or felony adult court for the action he 
committed if he is adjudged guilty said janice warder chief of 
the juvenile division of the dallas county district attorneys 
office 
luan who records show was only 13 when he was convicted of 
armed robbery in 1986 was sentenced by a dallas jury to adult 
prison after lying to police about his age luan said he told 
officials that he was 17 to avoid return to a california juvenile 
facility from which he had fled 
the states highest criminal court ruled march 14 that district 
judge jack hampton lacked jurisdiction because luan was underage 
prosecutors say they planned to retry luan not just on the case 
that was thrown out but on three other robberies 
in 1986 luan agreed to a plea bargain for three 10year 
sentences only after a jury had sentenced him to 38 years on the 
first robbery 
prosecutors said they were preparing to handle all four cases 
together which could result in three life sentences for luan 
but defense lawyer bruce anton questioned the legality of the 
prosecutions plans 
if the district attorneys office intends to have the other 
three convictions voided at this time i intend to contest that 
matter anton said 
anton said he believes that state parole officials will release 
luan soon because the four years he has served probably have 
discharged his concurrent 10year sentences 
anton said he also doubts that prosecutors could prove their 
contention that luan was 16 not 13 at the time of the robbery and 
retry him as an adult

the government has ordered a review of the 
convictions of six men who claim police forced them to confess to 
two irish republican army bombings that killed 21 people in 1974 
home secretary david waddington said wednesday he had asked 
police to review points raised by lawyers for socalled birmingham 
six 
their cause has been taken up by amnesty international the 
irish government and most recently by cardinal tomas o fiaich the 
roman catholic primate of ireland 
waddington previously had resisted calls to review the case but 
said wednesday that his decision was based on new submissions from 
attorneys 
in the light of the outcome of those investigations i will 
give further consideration to whether my intervention in the 
convictions of the six men would be justified waddington said in 
a written statement to the house of commons 
asked at a news conference whether the inquiry centered on 
allegations of police misconduct waddington said i am not 
prepared to go into detail as to what the various questions are 
he indicated the case would be referred to an appeal court if 
the new investigation raised any questions about the convictions 
gareth peirce an attorney for the six said she hoped 
waddingtons decision would be the beginning of the end of the 
ordeal of the men and their families 
all six were sentenced to life in prison in 1975 for the 
bombings in birmingham 
in 1988 the court of appeal affirmed the convictions lord 
lane the lord chief justice said at the time that the longer 
this hearing has gone on the more this court has been convinced 
the jury was correct 
pressure for a review of the birmingham six case grew in october 
after a court set aside the convictions of four people for ira 
bombings in guildford and woolwich in 1974 
in that case prosecutors admitted police had tampered with 
documents relating to interrogations 
supporters of the birmingham convicts have argued their 
confessions contradict each other police tampered with logs to 
make statements appear consistent forensic evidence was flawed and 
no witness testified to seeing any of the men in the two pubs 
the explosions on nov 21 1974 at the mulberry bush and the 
tavern in the town killed 21 people and injured 162 the most 
deadly ira attack in england 
waddington formally requested the new review from the west 
midlands police force which developed the cases against the six 
johnny walker patrick hill hugh callaghan richard mcilkenny 
gerry hunter and billy power 
waddington said west midlands chief constable geoffrey dear had 
delegated the actual investigation to the devon and cornwall force 
the west midlands force is itself under investigation in 
august dear suspended two detectives and reassigned all 53 other 
members of the serious crime squad he acted following allegations 
supported by detailed technical evidence that detectives had 
falsified confessions since january 1986 
waddingtons announcement came one week before the broadcast of 
a documentary on the birmingham bombings which granada television 
says will identify five other men as the bombers one of those men 
is said to be in prison and the other four are at large

president fw de klerk of south africa 
said today that namibias independence and reforms in south africa 
have shown the world his government is serious about ending 
apartheid 
de klerk was present at ceremonies wednesday when south africa 
relinquished control of namibia after 75 years of colonial rule he 
also has met with numerous world leaders during his visit the 
latest sign that south africas international isolation has eased 
south africas bona fides good faith is accepted de klerk 
said this morning before returning to south africa for talks with 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
the international community in general now accepts that 
drastic change is going to take place in south africa de klerk 
said 
the south african president who has initiated a series of 
reforms since assuming power in august held talks in namibia with 
the countrys president sam nujoma un secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze as 
well as the presidents of six african nations and the foreign 
ministers of several european countries 
i informed the leaders with whom i met that our aim was a new 
constitution in south africa which will have the support of the 
majority of all south africans de klerk said while white 
domination should come to an end care should be taken to avoid a 
situation where one form of domination was replaced by another 
de klerk wants the countrys whites to share political power 
with south africas 28 million blacks but he opposes outright 
black majority rule he envisions some mechanism that would give 
the countrys 5 million whites veto power on major policy decisions 
de klerk said his talks went well with nujoma who led the 
guerrilla movement that waged a 23year war against south african 
rule 
there is a wish that we should remain good friends de klerk 
said 
he said the exact level of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries remained to be worked out south africa has full 
diplomatic relations with only one african country malawi but has 
trade missions in several others 
de klerk said the protracted civil wars in angola and mozambique 
were discussed at his meetings with foreign leaders 
in both those countries leftist governments have been fighting 
since the 1970s against rebel movements that were backed by south 
africa until a few years ago 
relations between south africa and the governments of angola and 
mozambique have improved recently but heavy fighting persists in 
both countries 
there have been a series of meetings in windhoek this week in an 
attempt to arrange a ceasefire and peace talks between the warring 
sides in angola 
the soviets back the angolan government while the united states 
supplies an estimated 50 million in assistance to guerrilla leader 
jonas savimbis national union for the total independence of angola

prosecutors say a us supreme court 
ruling letting grand jury witnesses disclose their testimony 
undermines the centuriesold concept of a secret panel that 
deciding es if criminal charges are warranted 
its another chink in the armor of the grand jury said 
buddy jacobs head of the florida prosecuting attorneys 
association we feel like the systems worked well enough to last 
800 years 
but mike smith the former news reporter who brought down 
floridas law barring disclosure of grand jury testimony said 
wednesdays unanimous ruling will prevent prosecutors from abusing 
the system 
the grand jury itself is kind of an inquisition process 
smith said if witnesses arent allowed to say what they did or 
heard in there then you not only have an inquisition but an 
inquisition operating in the dark 
the supreme court upheld an appeals court decision striking down 
a law that prohibited grand jury witnesses from ever revealing 
their testimony after the case ends fifteen other states have 
similar laws 
the ruling does not affect laws barring witnesses from revealing 
the testimony while the grand jury investigation is in progress 
the court did limit its ruling and were pleased with that 
jacobs said they could have ruled that the testimony could be 
made public during the investigation 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
the state failed to prove that prosecutors interests in secrecy 
were enough to overcome a reporters first amendment rights 
the potential for abuse of the florida prohibition through 
its employment as a device to silence those who know of unlawful 
conduct or irregularities on the part of public officials is 
apparent rehnquist wrote 
smith now a national guard sergeant at fort indiantown gap in 
annville pa was a reporter for the charlotte heraldnews in 1986 
when a grand jury in charlotte county called him to testify about 
stories he wrote alleging corruption in the sheriffs and state 
attorneys offices 
in a telephone interview wednesday smith said during his 
testimony he noticed that prosecutors were directing the jury 
foreman to take certain actions and controlled whether jurors would 
hand down any indictments 
the grand jury was not able to be the sword and the shield of 
the law it was supposed to be smith said 
after the investigation ended and no indictments were returned 
smith wanted to publish a news story and possibly a book about the 
case but was barred by law 
a federal judge upheld the law when smith challenged it but it 
was struck down by the 11th us circuit court of appeals and the 
state appealed 
george waas the assistant attorney general who handled the 
case said allowing publication of completed grand jury proceedings 
by witnesses could harm a future investigation that might occur if 
more evidence came to light 
there are instances where grand jury investigations are 
concluded only to be picked up again years later waas said 
its quite possible that details about what occurred before the 
jury might compromise the jurys ability to do its job 
waas also said the florida law which had been on the books for 
40 years properly balanced the need for secret testimony and the 
first amendment 
but the supreme court sided with smith who said the ruling 
reduces the omnipotence of prosecutors in grand jury proceedings 
the prosecutor basically did whatever he wanted to do the 
significance of this case is that hes lost a little bit of that 
control smith said

the countrys largest student 
demonstration ended peacefully today when thousands of protesters 
left a downtown park agreeing to give president lee tenghui a 
chance to implement democratic reform 
the weeklong sitin had attracted as many as 6000 students to 
the chiang kaishek memorial park 
we cherish the achievement of this movement we will return to 
the campus to continue our efforts said student leader fan yun 
we will give the governing nationalist party some time for the 
reforms 
she said students across the island would form a coalition to 
monitor the progress of the political and economic reforms that lee 
has vaguely promised 
applauding and shouting we want democratic reforms many of 
the students gradually left the park early in the morning about 
100 stayed to clean up the square which was filled with garbage 
from the sevenday occupation 
the protest was triggered by the election of lee by the national 
assembly which is dominated by elderly nationalist politicians who 
last faced election on the chinese mainland more than four decades 
ago 
the assemblymen fled to taiwan with the rest of the nationalist 
government after losing a civil war to the communists in 1949 they 
were frozen in office to support the nationalist claim to still be 
chinas legitimate government 
students want the national assembly to disband and for the 
people to choose the president by direct ballot 
in another development today presidential advisor li yuanzu 
66 was elected vice president by the assembly he was the 
handpicked nominee of president lee and was the only candidate 
president lee who also is chairman of the ruling nationalist 
party was elected to six years in office on wednesday and hourse 
later met with 53 leaders of the student protesters 
lee told students he would accept any suggestions that will 
benefit the nation i will certainly do my utmost to solve all 
problems lee said but it takes time 
he has promised to convene an emergency conference before july 
to discuss changing the countrys political system in response to 
widespread calls that taiwanese have a greater say in choosing 
their leaders

historic preservationists are tossing their 
sneakers in the closet and donning pinstripes to take an expanded 
message of community planning urban renewal and affordable housing 
to a broader audience 
im rather interested in acquainting a broader variety of 
professionals in the business of shaping cities with the broader 
concerns of historic preservation said j jackson walter 
president of the national trust for historic preservation we 
would like to preach beyond the choir 
a national conference beginning today in pittsburgh is one of 
the first attempts to link the common interests of preservationists 
and planners organizers said 
jerold s kayden a visiting faculty member at the lincoln 
institute of land policy in cambridge mass called the twoday 
conference of historic preservationists and professional planners 
public officials and developers their debutante party 
before they were walking down the same aisle but they didnt 
recognize each other he said 
about 250 people from historic preservationists to landuse 
attorneys are expected to attend the conference 
preservationists have joined the political process in ways they 
traditionally were absent a decade ago said elizabeth waters 
mayor of charlottesville va 
historic preservation has moved much more toward community 
planning and development she said 
preservationists are traveling in pretty heavy company 
walter said 
for example he said in president bushs most recent budget 
proposal efforts to preserve americas heritage rate high on the 
national agenda in the same realm as protecting the environment 
and improving the infrastructure and transportation system 
the conference also will focus on past successes and failures in 
burgeoning suburban areas many of which are turning into small 
cities that are home to more than 60 percent of the nations 
offices 
sponsors decided to hold the conference in pittsburgh because of

producers of the cosby show asked nbc for 
a 100 million signing bonus to renew the topranked comedy series 
for a seventh season but have dropped their request to 25 
million a newspaper reported today 
marcy carsey and tom werner have spent the past eight weeks in 
negotiations with brandon tartikoff entertainment chief for the 
national broadcasting co the los angeles times reported 
david brokaw a spokesman for carseywerner said it is the 
companys policy not to comment on matters of this kind 
tartikoff also declined to comment but said money is the main 
dispute in the final rounds of renewal negotiations 
when youre talking about renewing the no 1rated show in 
television its a question of how high youre willing to go they 
have one level and we have another level tartikoff said 
he made the comments last week after presenting nbcs fall 
development projects to advertisers 
cosby has reportedly earned 575 million so far for nbc and 
that amount is expected to increase substantially each year the 
show is on the network the newspaper said 
the series is filmed in new york and centers around the huxtable

initially with carseywerner asking for a 100 million signing 
bonus and nbc seeking a twoyear renewal the newspaper reported 
the producers then countered with a request for a 75 million 
bonus and a oneyear renewal they also wanted nbc to pay 1 
million an episode to cover all direct costs associated with 
the show the times reported 
carseywerner then considered dropping the bonus request if the 
network agreed to hike its license fee to 3 million per 30minute 
show but nbc declined 
more recent discussions have returned to the signing bonus 
request now reported at 25 million the lower figure takes into 
consideration network commitments to other carseywerner programs

soviet azerbaijanis poured across a 
bridge into iran after the soviet union opened a frontier crossing 
for the first time in 73 years irans official tehran radio 
reported 
the people who crossed the araks river bridge wednesday were 
irans first officially sanctioned visitors from the soviet 
republic under an agreement reached after violent demonstrations in 
january over opening the border 
the gates on the bridge swung open to mark the iranian moslem 
new year of 1369 which started wednesday the radio said 
relatives from iran and the soviet azerbaijani region of 
nakhichevan met at the crossing in the city of jolfa said the 
report monitored in cyprus 
many of the people were ecstatic with joy and warmly embraced 
their relatives tehran radio said it gave no figures for the 
number of those crossing 
the iranians showered the arriving soviet moslems with gifts 
including flowers sweets and beverages as well as the koran the 
moslem holy book 
the radio said that an agreement between tehran and moscow 
allowed for all residents living within 2 miles of the border to 
cross unimpeded 
nakhichevan is a mostly moslem enclave surrounded by soviet 
armenia but governed by mainly moslem azerbaijan 
the border between iran and the soviet union was shaken by 
violence starting in december when moslems protesting its closure 
tore down fences and burned border posts 
the tehran radio report indicated the bridge gates had been 
closed since the 1917 russian revolution although the red army did 
not assert complete control over azerbaijan until 1920 
last month the soviet union and iran signed an agreement to 
allow citizens from either side to cross four times a year and 
travel in designated territories for up to 15 days 
the estimated 20 million azerbaijanis in the soviet union and 
iran mostly shiite moslems share the same religion language and 
culture

highprofile works of art like those stolen from a 
boston museum are difficult to protect and unlikely to be 
recovered according to some european experts 
interpol the international crime clearing house says only 5 
percent to 10 percent of the stolen artwork it tries to track is 
recovered 
the united states has requested help from the organization on 
the theft sunday at the isabella stewart gardner museum said 
elisabeth gams an interpol inspector 
ms gams said it was too soon to guess the motive for the thefts 
or what might happen to the works which include paintings by 
rembrandt vermeer degas and manet 
if there is no ransom demand in the coming days one could 
suppose the paintings are with someone she said referring to a 
theft by contract but we can imagine everything works of such 
value are unsalable 
europe leads the world in stolen art works with italy then 
france the prime victims ms gams said the chief targets are 
churches then private collectors followed by museums 
experts say everything from petty banditry to terrorism is 
behind thefts 
every time it happens we wonder what these people want to do 
with those lovely paintings said margreet kolkman spokeswoman 
for amsterdams renowned rijksmuseum the problem is theyre 
worthless and priceless at the same time 
such artworks cant be sold anywhere thats absolutely 
impossible she said probably some idiot wants to keep them in 
his safe and sometimes cast a glance on them 
in 1988 the dutch art world was hit by two spectacular thefts 
in june three paintings including a van gogh and a cezanne were 
stolen from amsterdams municipal museum in december three van 
goghs were stolen from the krollermuller museum in otterlo 
the first three paintings were recovered as they were about to 
be sold to an undercover law enforcement agent the krollermuller 
thieves demanded an undisclosed ransom but the van goghs were 
recovered after police set up a trap 
pictures can go underground for years sleeping in police 
parlance 
or they pass through various hands on the black market until 
they find a home with a fervent collector anthony russell of 
scotland yards arts and antiques squad was quoted as telling the 
times newspaper when these people see a picture they want they 
go after it come what may they want it for themselves and nothing 
else matters 
paintings stolen in europe or the united states have been 
recovered in asia and the middle east 
authorities do not exclude terrorism as a possible motive in art 
thefts in 1974 sympathizers of the irish republican army stole 
vermeers the guitar players but the painting eventually was 
recovered in a rural churchyard 
museum officials often feel helpless and say it is impossible to 
adequately secure a public place such as a museum 
we have the most sophisticated security said marianne de la 
fond the assistant curator of the marmottan museum in paris nine 
impressionist paintings were stolen from the museum in 1985 
including claude monets impression soleil levant impression 
sunrise 
its like in a bank if an armed person enters a public place 
there is nothing you can do she said 
the tactics used for the marmottan theft were unique marianne 
de la fond noted recalling that it was carried out in daylight by 
five armed men 
i have always believed that if a burglar wants to steal 
something he will the more you arm yourself with sophisticated 
devices the more it becomes a challenge to thieves said philip 
rylands curator of the peggy guggenheim museum in venice 
there are things against which you cant protect yourself 
said ms kolkman of the rijksmuseum a museum is a public 
building not a fort we have to admit people thats our 
function

czechoslovakias former communist rulers sold tons 
of semtex plastic explosives to libya but its new noncommunist 
government has stopped all such exports president vaclav havel 
said today 
havel in britain on an official visit made his comments at a 
news conference at the czechoslovak embassy 
the past regime exported 1000 tons to libya he said if 
you consider that it takes 200 grams 7 ounces to blow up an 
aircraft this means world terrorism has enough semtex to last for 
150 years 
semtex was used in the bombing of pan am flight 103 which 
exploded over lockerbie scotland in december 1988 killing all 259 
on board and 11 people on the ground 
we ceased exporting this explosive some time ago havel 
said speaking through a translator he did not give a date or any 
other details 
the former dissident playwright said tuesday that his countrys 
considerable arms industry would no longer sell weapons to 
totalitarian regimes but would continue to sell arms to 
democracies 
czechoslovakia has long been a major arms manufacturer it 
produces hand grenades automatic rifles tanks and armored 
personnel carriers in addition to explosives 
published reports say that the export of such weapons and 
components accounted for between onequarter and onehalf of 
czechoslovakias foreignexchange earnings the nation strapped 
for hard currency may find it difficult to stop the trade 
czechoslovakia under the hardline communist regime of milos 
jakes and gustav husak found a market among nations too poor to 
afford expensive western weapons or those denied access for 
political reasons 
in addition to libya clients have included angola south yemen 
and the palestine liberation organization 
havel stopped short of saying that czechoslovakia would no 
longer manufacture semtex but defended its production for peaceful 
use 
this is an industrial explosive necessary for various 
industrial uses it is not an explosive made especially for 
terrorists he said 
but now we want to mark semtex so it will be detectable he 
added 
semtex is odorless and can be molded into any shape making it 
almost undetectable by conventional antiterrorist devices 
on wednesday the first day of his threeday visit havel had 
lunch with queen elizabeth ii then had talks with prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
he said they discussed the future of europe and german 
unification 
i told her that the process of unification should be 
understood as a sort of engine propelling the unification of the 
whole of europe he said no new european order can be built on 
a permanent fear of any one nation

on jump out of the car and run towards him to get an autograph 
they used to scare the poor old man to death

to oversee democratic elections 
in several letters to the legislature the great peoples hural 
oppostion parties also demanded the government shut down the marda 
uranium mine but energy minister batkhuyag reported it had already 
been closed 
the mine in eastern mongolia produced 100000 tons of uranium 
last year for export to the soviet union batkhuyag said numerous 
newspaper articles recently have clamored for it to shut down 
mongolias only functioning buddhist monastery meanwhile 
petitioned the great peoples hural to abolish government control 
on religion 
the demands were the latest by prodemocracy groups that sprang 
up four months ago modeling themselves after similar movements in 
the soviet bloc mongolia sandwiched between the soviet union and 
china has been a soviet satellite since 1921 and allows red army 
soldiers to be based on its soil 
the letters from gandan monastery and the opposotion parties 
were read to the hural by j gurragchaa a deputy who became 
mongolias first cosmonaut when he served as a crew member in a 
soviet space mission in 1981 
opposition groups were allowed to send observers to the annual 
hural session for the first time ever but they were not allowed to 
speak 
the mongolian democratic association and its affiliate the 
mongolian democratic party are seeking legal guarantees that the 
communist party wont end the countrys latest political thaw they 
are also demanding legalization of opposition parties and a 
provisional legislature 
the mongolian democratic association has suggested several 
formulas for setting up such a legislature with the ruling 
mongolian peoples revolutionary party holding at most onethird of 
the seats currently the comunists account for 93 percent of the 
hurals 370 deputies 
the main thing is for us to have our own vote there but we 
have little hope galsandorg a lawyer and association member 
said earlier in the week 
several hural deputies expressed concern in speeches today about 
the proliferation of opposition groups and called for a law to 
regulate them 
i think mongolia doesnt need so many meetings and political 
forces said batzul an elderly delegate from western mongolia 
they press the communist party and government and demand 
things and if these demands are not met they organize 
demonstrations and hunger strikes i am against that said a 
woman delegate who won warm applause 
even families have leaders and we must too she said 
a military dlegate who spoke wednesday nght also suggested laws 
to regulate demonstrations and set conditions for imposing a state 
of emergency 
another delegate zayat said demonstrations have occurred in 
rural areas as well as ulan bator but gave no details 
the opposition groups especially the mongolian democratic 
association say thay have set up branches nationwide although 
their bases are in the capital 
the ruling party has replaced its top leadership and the hural 
elected a new president and prime minister on wednesday as steps 
toward reform but opposition groups say more than personnel 
changes are needed 
the letter from gandan monastery in ulan bator was the first 
time mongolias tiny but influentual community of monks had called 
for religious freedom a few monks have joined opposition ralies 
and they held a joint rally with the mongolian democratic 
association on march 11 at a former temple to demand its reopening 
but so far they have moved cautiously in asserting a political 
role 
historically buddhist monks held great wealth and power in 
mongolia but in the 1930s and 40s the communists shut down 
mongolias more than 700 monasteries and forced the monks who 
accounted for nearly half the male population to take secular jobs 
gandan was allowed to reopen in 1944 but its fewer than 160 
monks are not allowed to preach outaside monastery grounds

the political party that finished second in 
east germanys first free election said today it is ready to begin 
talks with the winning conservatives on building a broad coalition 
government 
but the party the social democrats set an important condition 
that could hinder the negotiations 
meanwhile the winners of sundays parliamentary election the 
conservative alliance for germany led by the christian democrats 
said that it would carry out its campaign pledge and forge ahead 
with quick reunification 
the statement by the social democrats excluded any cooperation 
with the german social union the most rightwing of the three 
parties in the alliance for germany which also includes the 
democratic awakening 
a twothirds majority in the new 400seat parliament is needed 
to approve unification with west germany and the conservative 
alliance needs the votes of the social democrats to assure passage 
the communists who ruled the country for more than 40 years 
finished third in the balloting 
richard schroeder social democratic member of parliament read 
a statement to reporters saying his party decided on the move to 
negotiate in view of the serious problems of our country 
the party earlier this week rejected an offer by the 
conservative alliance to form a governing coalition 
no date was set for the start of the talks which the social 
democrats described as preliminary discussions to find out whether 
there is enough common ground with the christian democrats to enter 
formal coalition talks 
a christian democratic spokesman quoted by the governmentrun 
adn news agency welcomed the decision 
in bonn today leaders of the alliance for germany said the 
three conservative parties will work closely in parliament but 
would not build a common bloc of deputies 
this was seen as a formula that could leave the door open for 
the social democrats to join in a coalition without formally having 
to cooperate with the german social union 
lothar de maiziere head of east germanys christian democrats 
met late wednesday in bonn with chancellor helmut kohl of west 
germany kohl backs the alliance and campaigned vigorously on its 
behalf 
de maiziere denied allegations he collaborated with the 
communist secret police that was disbanded after the hardline 
communist government of erich honecker was ousted in october amid 
massive demonstrations 
concern is growing over whether the new freely elected 
parliament is riddled with members who once cooperated with the 
hated stasi secret police 
the west german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said today that 
prodemocracy groups received an anonymous tip in january that de 
maiziere had collaborated with the secret police 
the christian democratic union had been a puppet party 
maintained by the ousted communist government but it worked to 
establish its independence after the peaceful revolution late last 
year 
de maiziere became its leader after the revolution

a filipino military general claims 
the us defense intelligence agency supported a coup attempt in 
december that was put down with the help of american jets 
the us embassy today denied the allegation made by brig gen 
alejandro galido in a sworn statement released wednesday by the 
department of justice 
in his statement galido said an american who claimed to be an 
air force colonel and the representative of the us defense 
intelligence agency in the philippines told him in july that his 
agency favors the overthrow of the aquino government and the 
return of the marcoses to the philippines 
the defense intelligence agency is an information gathering 
division of the us department of defense and joint chiefs of 
staff 
galido said the american harold magleo promised to deliver 
shipments of firearms ammunition antitank missiles and 
other weapons for the dec 19 coup attempt provided marcos or 
the loyalist group will give them 20 million for their group to 
produce these war materials 
he also said us ambassador nicholas platt held a party at his 
home in august during which conspirators received written 
instructions from filipino brig gen edgardo abenina who was held 
at a military camp for involvement in a coup attempt in 1987 
in its denial the us embassy statement said there was no col 
magleo on its staff 
galido former military commander in southern luzon said he was 
aware of plans for the coup attempt and he implicated numerous 
military officers and civilians in the plot 
he said abenina suggested assassinating president corazon 
aquino defense secretary fidel ramos and the military chief of 
staff gen renato de villa abenina was arrested in january 
the us embassy states categorically and absolutely that 
press stories suggesting the us governments involvement in the 
december coup attempt are totally without foundation said us 
embassy spokeswoman victoria middleton 
any allegation that ambassador platt was somehow involved in 
contacts with persons plotting against the government is totally 
false and without foundation she said platt was out of the 
country and unavailable for comment 
the united states demonstrated its support for president 
aquino and philippine democracy during the coup attempt that 
support was absolutely firm then and continues to be firm today 
ms middleton said 
she said the party at platts residence aug 16 1989 was a 
normal diplomatic function and among those invited were cabinet 
and military officials including galido 
the latest coup attempt was launched shortly after midnight on 
dec 1 when thousands of mutineers attacked military and media 
facilities seized aircraft at villamor air base and staged air 
strikes on the presidential palace 
us f4 phantom jets from clark air base flew air cover in 
support of government forces and prevented the mutineers from 
continuing their air strikes at least 113 people were killed and 
more than 600 injured before rebels surrendered their last 
stronghold dec 9 
mrs aquinos spokesman adolfo azcuna said the government 
would not comment on galidos statement until a presidential 
commission established to investigate the coup attempt submits its 
final report 
de villa told reporters today the filing of the charges against 
the alleged conspirators will eventually determine whether 
galidos report is credible 
asked why the government and the military if previously warned 
of the coup plot appeared to have been caught off guard when the 
mutineers struck de villa said we did not know the time 
he said the galidos statement of us involvement is an 
allegation that has to be looked into and which the military is 
certainly investigating 
there are many americans here in the philippines de villa 
said there are americans who come and go 
defense undersecretary leonardo quisumbing said other military 
officers gave statements that supported galidos allegations 
i am saying that we have witnesses including officers to 
that effect quisumbing said well in effect that there were 
others involved as it is now coming out in the sworn statement 
they involve some foreigners 
quisumbing noted that galido did not involve the entire us 
government only the defense intelligence agency and a certain 
american officer

when charles stuarts claim that a black 
man killed his wife and wounded him as they sat in their car in 
boston turned out to be an apparent hoax it sounded familiar in 
the atlanta suburb of marietta 
police here too were in the midst of a case of murder pinned 
on a black and nonexistent scapegoat 
neva veitch told police two black men abducted her and her 
husband bobby joe veitch from a motel bar the night of nov 20 
1987 shot her husband to death and attacked her 
police made composite drawings of the alleged killers and 
interviewed more than 20 suspects but authorities made no arrests 
and declared the case inactive 
then in november david lee craig leader of a ku klux klan 
splinter group walked into the police station and said mrs 
veitch his mistress at the time of the slaying was the true 
culprit 
but when craig taped telephone calls to her for police she 
implicated him his lawyer says and a grand jury indicted both of 
them on murder charges 
testimony in craigs trial began wednesday in cobb county 
superior court and is expected to last through the week mrs 
veitchs trial will come later 
in boston police apparently had accepted at face value the 
story stuart called in on his car phone on oct 23 that he and his 
pregnant wife had been shot by a black man who jumped in their car 
and robbed them after they left a birthing class 
police reportedly closed in on a black man william bennett as 
the lead suspect until jan 3 when stuarts brother matthew told 
police charles had plotted to kill his wife collect insurance and 
blame the killing on blacks 
the next day charles stuart jumped to his death from a bridge 
police now speculate that stuart shot himself and his wife and 
that his brother took the gun and threw it into a river where it 
was recovered the brother who has not been charged said he went 
to police because he feared bennett would go to jail 
both the boston and atlanta cases played on racial 
stereotypes says derrick bell a harvard university law 
professor we cannot ignore the fact there is a lot of black 
crime in cities like atlanta what their story did was play on 
that fear of black crime 
robert friedmann criminal justice professor at georgia state 
university said craig and mrs veitch knew the media and the 
public are fascinated with a fear of crime particularly 
blackonwhite crime 
district attorney thomas charron accused craig and mrs veitch 
of preying on prejudice he acknowledged similarities with the 
stuart case 
charron called the veitch case a classic love triangle 
billy veitch a truck driver and often away from home craig and 
mrs veitch falling in love through his klan splinter group craig 
was imperial wizard of the true knights of the ku klux klan she 
was the groups secretarytreasurer 
david and neva were in love and they agreed that billy veitch 
had to be killed charron told the jury in craigs trial 
mrs veitch initially told police she and her husband were 
abducted at a motel bar at gunpoint by two blacks and taken to an 
isolated warehouse district where the two told her they were going 
to rape her and make her husband watch 
she said her husband lunged at them and she closed her eyes and 
heard three shots her husband lay on the ground bleeding from 
back wounds 
after that she said they drove her away beating her with a 
flashlight she said one of them sodomized her before she escaped 
ran to an allnight diner and called police who found her beaten 
and bloodied 
in november however craig told cobb county police 
investigators there had been no black men mrs veitch he said 
was the killer and he offered to help prove it 
but mrs veitch implicated craig in taped telephone 
conversations said craigs courtappointed defense lawyer ronnie 
knighton 
knighton denied that his client had anything to do with the 
killing 
he said she had asked craig on previous occasions to kill her 
husband but he refused knighton claimed mrs veitch rejected the 
idea of getting a divorce to marry craig because she wanted her 
husbands insurance money 
craig who also was married left his family and moved in with 
mrs veitch soon after the killing he said he went to police 
because she had a new boyfriend and he feared for his own life he 
said he had been shot at twice 
mrs veitchs attorney has asked that she be tested to determine 
if she is mentally competent to stand trial and has indicated he 
may use an insanity defense the journal and constitution of 
atlanta reported sunday the paper did not name the attorney

a west german businessman was charged 
today with helping to build a plant in libya that was suspected of 
producing chemical weapons before it was damaged in a fire earlier 
this month 
the indictment against juergen hippenstielimhausen former head 
of the imhausenchemie chemical company charged him with violating 
west germanys export laws and tax evasion 
also today a west german official said libya cut off trade with 
west germany after accusing it of setting fire to the chemical 
plant 
west germany made a formal protest today to the tripoli 
government said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
prosecutor peter wechsung charged that hippenstielinhausen 
played a decisive role in the planning and construction of the 
chemical complex in rabta libya 60 miles southwest of tripoli 
wechsung said hippenstielinhausen shipped to libya documents 
on production as well as measuring and regulating instruments 
to be used by the chemical complex he said investigators had 
concluded that the libyan plant was solely intended for the 
production of poison gases 
wechsung also disclosed that west germanys federal police had 
created a special rabta unit consisting of 20 officials who 
took part in the investigation speaking to reporters in mannheim 
wechsung said about 3000 files containing documents plans and 
other material had been confiscated in the investigation and that 
statements were taken from more than 200 witnesses 
wechsung did not say whether other arrests were expected 
hippenstielimhausen stepped down as head of the company in 
march and was arrested on oct 5 
a number of west german companies were raided a little more than 
a year ago after us charges that german firms had helped build 
the plant however only hippenstielimhausen has been arrested 
relations between bonn and tripoli have badly soured since libya 
alleged that west germany and the united states had a hand in the 
march 14 fire at the rabta plant which us officials charge 
produced poison gas 
washington and bonn have denied libyas allegations and libya 
says the plant produces pharmaceuticals 
before the fire west germany had launched an international 
initiative to find a way to keep the plant from producing chemical 
weapons 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister had 
proposed putting together an international team to inspect the 
plant 
the bonn government official said libya barred a ship carrying 
libyan oil to proceed to its destination in west germany and 
stopped payments to west german companies doing business in the 
north african nation 
i dont know the amount of money involved said the 
official who gave no further details 
on tuesday west german ambassador joerg helmer went to the 
libyan foreign office in tripoli to express our displeasure 
with the libyan actions regarding trade said the bonn government 
official 
the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoting government 
officials reported libya has blocked trade with the west germany 
since last week 
west germany is one of libyas major trading partners libyan 
exports to west germany last year amounted to 185 billion most 
of it oil west german exports to libya last year were valued at 
780 million 
west german government officials say it appears libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi has decided to single out west germany because of 
bonns public pronouncements against the plant in rabta and 
genschers international initiative aimed at keeping the factory 
from making poison gas 
the rabta plant caused a scandal in west germany a little more 
than a year ago after the united states alleged german firms 
helped build it 
west germany at first denied the us claims but later 
acknowledged them and launched its own investigations the main 
company under investigation is imhausenchemie of the southern west 
german town of lahr 
juergen hippenstielimhausen stepped down as head of the company 
last march and was arrested on oct 5 he remains in investigative 
custody 
since the scandal west germany has taken steps to crack down on 
companies or individuals that violate export regulations and 
beefed up its export laws

one year after the nations worst oil spill 
hit alaskan waters many us coastal areas face similar threats 
and need tighter standards for tankers pilots and tug escorts two 
environmental groups said today 
the natural resources defense council and the center for marine 
conservation said in independently prepared reports that there are 
many measures not now employed that would help prevent such 
disasters 
we have the knowhow to prevent accidents before they happen 
especially in our most sensitive waters said roger mcmanus 
president of the center for marine conservation 
the studies were undertaken after the tanker exxon valdez ran 
aground and spewed more than 11 million gallons of toxic crude oil 
into prince william sound one year ago saturday 
the natural resources defense council analyzed three of the 
nations busiest ports san francisco new york and los angeles 
each of which handles at least 1000 tanker visits each year 
among the principal recommendations in the two reports are 
requiring oil tankers and barges to have double hulls and 
double bottoms 
requiring tug escorts for tankers in difficult waters and 
biologically sensitive areas 
establishing tankerfree zones in environmentally vulnerable 
areas 
requiring licensed pilots for all tankers and barges over a 
minimum size within harbors 
the groups also recommended that the federal government take 
responsibility immediately for cleanup of major spills and that 
contingency plans be drawn up to prepare for the worst spill that 
could happen 
to date exxon has spent more than 2 billion when a fraction 
of that would have prevented not only the disaster at prince 
william sound but the succeeding spills and groundings in new 
york the florida keys houston and californias huntington 
beach mcmanus said 
the center for marine conservation report urged that the coast 
guard control traffic within 15 miles of the florida keys where a 
series of vessel groundings late last year extensively damaged 
coral reefs it said tankers should avoid certain areas along the 
california coast to protect sensitive wildlife and ecosystems such 
as sea birds kelp beds sea otters and other marine mammals 
in a news conference on wednesday wildlife experts said they 
learned much after the alaska spill but still dont have the 
facilities they will need when more such spills occur 
if there is an oil spill tomorrow we really arent that much 
further ahead in advanced planning than we were a year ago said 
randall davis codirector of international wildlife research in 
san diego 
certainly it will happen again in some form said jay 
holcomb director of the international bird rescue research center 
in berkeley calif oil spills never seem to stop 
davis was in charge of efforts to rescue sea otters and other 
marine mammals after the exxon valdez spill a year ago saturday and 
holcomb led the effort to rescue birds 
they appeared together at a luncheon wednesday at which the 
izaak walton league of america one of the nations oldest 
conservation groups presented an award to procter amp gamble for the 
companys support of the wildlife rescue efforts 
i never want to experience what i saw when we first took our 
boats out in alaska to find birds in a foot deep of oil with their 
heads sticking out yelling and otters crying on the rocks because 
they were covered in oil and were already suffering from the 
ingestion problems holcomb said 
davis said even today we really dont have any permanent 
facility nor any permanent organization to respond to another oil 
spill if it should occur with regards to treating marine mammals 
both said they learned valuable lessons from the alaska 
experience however 
we had never been able to work with some of the species such 
as the horned and tufted puffins beautiful yet nasty birds 
holcomb said we handled 200 or 300 and released quite a few we 
learned some new techniques 
davis said the alaska accident was the first spill to ever 
involve large numbers of marine mammals and sea otters in 
particular we learned a tremendous amount working on that spill

a team of indian scientists has induced bamboo 
plants to flower in the laboratory a first for one of the worlds 
most important timber and fodder crops 
the breakthrough promises to pave the way for improved breeding 
of bamboo stock and provide a perennial source of bamboo seed 
according to an article published today in the journal nature 
its a breakthrough that could have real significance for a 
quarter of the worlds population david hanke a cambridge 
university botanist told the new york times 
throughout the tropics bamboo is a vital source of lightweight 
rotresistant wood for houses and furniture it even provides 
scaffolding used in building skyscrapers and supertankers 
domestic uses include tools baskets musical instruments and 
pulp for paper bamboo hay has up to four times the protein of 
other fodder grasses and is a staple for livestock 
the versatile plants reproductive quirks make it a difficult 
plant to grow and harvest 
most of the over 500 species of bamboo flower only once in their 
lifetimes between the ages of 12 to 120 years a bamboo thicket 
flowers simultaneously and then dies leaving behind a thick 
carpet of seeds 
to insure a dependable supply of seeds af mascarenhas and two 
colleagues at the national chemical laboratory in pune india 
suspended tiny cuttings of bamboo in a test tube cocktail of 
coconut milk plant growth hormones and other nutrients 
after two more applications of the cocktail and a few weeks 
adultsize flowers began blooming 
the researchers have yet to plant the seeds but expect them to 
be viable

opposition politicans boycotted the 
opening session of the federal legislature today charging that a 
legal technicality had ended prime minister benazir bhuttos term 
in office 
members of ms bhuttos party said the opposition would have to 
go to court to try to unseat her 
only eight lawmakers took their seats on the opposition bench 
and demanded that ms bhutto face reelection among the members of 
the national assembly the lower lawmaking house of pakistans 
parliament 
we regret we cannot participate in this session said 
abida hussein an influential member of the 16 mainly rightwing 
parties that make up the alliance known as the combined opposition 
parties 
the oppositions demand centers around a clause in pakistans 
constitution that empowered the president to appoint the prime 
minister that clause expired tuesday and opposition leaders 
contend ms bhutto must be reelected by secret ballot in the 
237member assembly 
ms bhutto so far has ignored the demand 
newspaper reports had speculated she might call for a vote of 
confidence in her 16monthold government when the assembly 
convened but tariq rahim the parliamentary affairs minister 
dismissed the suggestion and called the boycott totally 
unjustified 
this parliament was eleced for five years and god willing this 
parliament will complete its tenure rahim said in a stern 
response if you have any questions about the constitution go to 
court 
the prime minister listened to the arguments from the house 
leaders chair at the front of the dark wood chamber but made no 
comment 
ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party controls about 111 seats in 
the national assembly but rules mainly with the help of smaller 
parties and independents the combined opposition parties have 86 
seats 
ms bhuttos leftleaning government has been buffetted by 
charges of corruption and inaction on a host of social and economic 
problems that grew under a decade of martial law she narrowly 
survived a noconfidence vote put forward in november by the 
opposition 
but supporters say her troubles with the islamic and nationalist 
opposition parties are behind her pointing to a showofstrength 
rally tuesday in the eastern city of lahore the heartland of the 
opposition others contend ms bhutto only looks stronger because 
the opposition is divided and weaker 
the 36yearold prime minister was appointed to a fiveyear term 
by president ghulam ishaq khan after her party captured the most 
seats in the november 1988 parliamentary elections 
but the presidents constitutional authority to appoint 
pakistans prime minister expired tuesday and opposition 
politicians have been arguing for months that ms bhutto must be 
reelected by a secret national assembly ballot 
we believe she is no longer the prime minister she has no 
power to convene the house so any session would be illegal said 
shaukat abassi spokesman for the combined opposition parties 
opposition leaders claimed ms bhutto convened the assembly to 
deliberately spoil preparations for their showofstrength rally on 
friday in lahore

an attorney for imelda marcos said the 
philippine government is trying to turn americans against his 
client who is being tried on fraud charges involving 325 million 
the lawyer gerry spence gave the judge on wednesday what he 
said were documents describing philippine government lobbyists 
efforts to instill bias and prejudice in this country against 
the former philippine first lady 
judge john f keenan said he would examine the papers but 
expressed doubt about their relevance to the trial 
twentyone prospective jurors were selected wednesday for the 
trial of mrs marcos and saudi arabian financier adnan m 
khashoggi who is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of 
justice 
the philippine government through a new york public relations 
firm released on wednesday the text of a letter from mrs marcos 
to president bush sent march 5 
the letter asked for bushs help to assure that money and 
property that she said her late husband intended for the filipino 
people be turned over to an independent fivemember commission 
your government has publicly lamented the gross corruption 
the widespread irresponsibility and fragile hold on power of the 
aquino government mrs marcos wrote 
therefore you must understand my own apprehension over any 
agreement by which this property would be given over to the 
possession of that government since the likelihood of it ever 
reaching our people is little or nothing 
mrs marcos also asked that bush help arrange for her husbands 
body to be returned home 
copies of the letter also went to former president reagan and 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the white house said tuesday that bush would not respond to the 
letter during the trial 
keenan resumed his screening of jurors today the judge has said 
he expects the preliminary winnowing of prospective jurors to take

an accountant accused of killing his 
mother wife and three children 18 years ago says he is innocent 
because of a mental defect the judge in the mans trial said 
jury selection was completed wednesday evening after john e 
lists attorney elijah l miller exhausted the 20 challenges he 
can use to remove potential jurors 
superior court judge le wertheimer refused to grant him 
additional challenges 
mr list denies he is guilty of murder wertheimer told a 
panel of potential jurors he says as a result of a mental 
disease or defect he committed the crime 
miller hinted at such a defense tuesday when he asked a 
prospective juror if he could still follow the judges instructions 
to be impartial if for instance list acted out of insanity 
or a mental defect 
when asked what lists defense would be miller replied what 
the judge said 
miller is expected to appeal wertheimers rejection of his juror 
challenges and the selection of some jurors claiming that they are 
biased 
none of the 16 jurors live in westfield where the slayings took 
place some have said they read or heard about the murders all 
told wertheimer they had no opinion regarding lists innocence or 
guilt 
more than 130 union county residents were interviewed since jury 
selection began tuesday the trial is scheduled to begin march 30 
after a week of pretrial hearings 
list 64 is accused of killing his mother wife and three 
children in their westfield mansion in november 1971 
authorities said the former accountant spent most the last 18 
years in denver where he remarried he was arrested by the fbi on 
june 1 shortly after moving to a suburb of richmond va his case 
also was featured on a nationally televised anticrime program

yes kathleen turner is a tough sexy and even 
funny maggie in the respectable occasionally riveting revival of 
cat on a hot tin roof that opened wednesday at broadways 
eugene oneill theater 
but the heart of tennessee williams southernfried gothic 
melodrama belongs to big daddy the dying patriarch of 28000 
acres of the richest land this side of the valley nile 
big daddy is an amazing role maybe the best williams ever 
wrote the character contains all the colorful peculiarities that 
people mostly yankees love to associate with the south yet hes 
more than a brutal moneygrubbing lascivious mountain of a man 
played with remarkable control by charles durning big daddy is 
a seeker of truth and truth is what cat on a hot tin roof is 
all about everybody else in the play including maggie is afraid 
of it 
the truth has kept maggie and her alcoholic husband brick 
apart brick big daddys favorite son is an aging golden boy 
whose luster has begun to tarnish he drinks his days away hoping 
to hear the click that will help him forget a promising 
football career and the relationship he had with skipper his 
nowdead best friend 
the truth is what everyone is trying to hide from big daddy who 
has been told his stomach troubles are nothing more than a spastic 
colon but reality is revealed in a long second act confrontation 
between brick and big daddy the father forces his son to look into 
the past and the son inadvertently tells the father about the 
future 
its a powerful moment particularly as played by durning and 
daniel hugh kelly as the doomed brick brick is something of a 
cipher a difficult character to get a handle on but kelly manages 
to make him a sympathetic person thats no mean feat and durning 
is at his best alternatively flamboyant and ultimately sensitive 
to his sons problem its a remarkable juggling act 
turner controls the plays first and third acts the woman is a 
star and its not easy to take your eyes off her as she sashays 
around the stage particularly in designer patricia zipprodts 
lavender lace slip 
theres an intelligence and a steely determination to her 
portrayal of maggie particularly when she is defending her own 
interests you can see the combative character plot her attack 
trying to stop brotherinlaw gooper and his wife mae from 
getting control of big daddys will 
director howard davies approach to the play is traditional 
nothing as startling or eccentric as sir peter halls distinctive 
examination of williams orpheus descending early in the 
season there are no surprises or revelations but then nothing goes 
wrong either 
polly holliday as big mama starts in high screech but gradually 
calms down so that by the time the play ends she has become a woman 
of strength kevin orourke and debra jo rupp teeter on caricature 
as maggies greedy family opponents but pull back before turning 
into cartoons and their gaggle of children those celebrated 
noneck monsters are appropriately and hilariously 
repulsive 
cat on a hot tin roof was williams personal favorite among 
his own works he loved the plays unity its action over the three 
long acts is continuous he loved its impeccable construction and 
he loved those characters particularly big daddy 
i reached beyond myself in the second act to a kind of crude 
eloquence of expression in big daddy that i have managed to give no 
other character of my creation williams says in his memoirs 
watching durning on stage you can perfectly understand that 
statement

what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times it takes nothing away from 
kathleen turners radiant maggie in cat on a hot tin roof to 
say that broadways gripping new production of tennessee williams 
1955 play will be most remembered for charles durnings big daddy 
howard kissel daily news we find ourselves seeing the play 
clearly but dispassionately detachment is not what williams had in 
mind 
clive barnes new york post turner mocking yet fearful 
sassily funny yet itchy with desires that go beyond sex and the 
all but innocent victim of a family in perpetual and hateful 
crisis is giving a performance to cherish in a play to revalue

the fbi issued composite drawings of the two 
thieves who pulled off one of the biggest art thefts of the 
century and the number of tips coming from the public has stepped 
up an official said today 
clad in police uniforms the pair talked their way into the 
isabella stewart gardner museum early sunday then overpowered the 
two guards on duty and took 11 paintings drawings and prints by 
such artists as rembrandt and degas they also swiped an ancient 
chinese vase and a gilded eagle from the flagpole of a napoleonic 
flag 
lyle grindle director of museum security said this morning 
that since the composites went out wednesday afternoon the pace of 
calls from tipsters seemed to have increased a 1 million reward 
has been offered for information for the return of the pictures 
were getting information he said were getting lots of 
calls from all aspects 
even before the 1 million reward was posted and the pictures 
were issued tipsters began calling the gardner museum and the fbi 
hinting they knew where the artworks could be found officials said 
wednesday 
at the same time with two of the museums looted rooms now 
behind police barricades the public was allowed inside wednesday 
for the first time since the crime 
considered too wellknown to be sold on the open market the 
five paintings and other works from mrs gardners collection has 
been estimated to be worth in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
the international auction houses sothebys and christies are 
underwriting the 1 million reward offered with no questions 
asked for safe return of the works 
youre generally talking about thieves that are going to be in 
contact with others in criminal circles and thats where it 
tipsters information generally comes from said fbi agent 
dennis ocallaghan 
while he would not comment on whether staff at the museum had 
been given lie detector tests he said former employees were being 
questioned a standard practice in such cases 
the thieves took two paintings and an etching by rembrandt 
three prints and two charcoals by edgar degas one painting each by 
edouard manet jan vermeer and govaert flinck and a bronze beaker 
dating from the chinese shang dynasty 12001100 bc 
the museum discovered tuesday that a gilded eagle atop a 
napoleonic flag was also stolen 
the composites showed two white men in policemens hats one was 
depicted with gold wirerimmed glasses a strong jaw dark hair and 
eyes and was described as being in his late 20s to early 30s of 
medium build and 5foot7 to 5foot10 the other suspect shown 
with pronounced cheekbones and dark hair and eyes was thought to 
be in his early to middle 30s 180 pounds and 6feet or 6foot1 
the composites showed the suspects both with mustaches and 
without because authorities believe they might have worn fake 
mustaches during the robbery

jurors at john poindexters irancontra trial 
watched the last of president reagans videotaped testimony today 
as the former president displayed annoyance at a prosecutors 
question 
the jurors watched closely but didnt react when reagan became 
visibly irritated at prosecutor dan webb who said reagan wasnt 
answering a question 
webb asked reagan whether the presidentially appointed tower 
commission concluded oliver north was assisting the contras 
militarily webb objected when reagan launched into a description 
of the commission and brought up diverting iran arms sale money to 
the contras 
that answer is completely unresponsive completely webb 
told the judge 
i dont think it is unresponsive to state what i appointed the 
commission to do reagan retorted the playing of the videotape 
which began wednesday morning was to conclude at midday today 
poindexter reagans former national security adviser is 
charged with five felony charges of conspiracy making false 
statements and obstructing congress in connection with the 
irancontra affair 
meanwhile poindexters lawyers say the jury should be told that 
north was called a liar by prosecutors at his own trial 
when he testified at his own trial last year north implicated a 
number of other reagan administration figures including poindexter 
few criminal defendants have attempted to blame so many others 
for so many lawless acts prosecutors told the judge in the north 
case last year they said he committed perjury on the witness 
stand 
at the poindexter trial however north is the governments star 
witness although a reluctant one and prosecutors are placing 
great reliance on his testimony 
fundamental fairness requires that the jury be told what 
prosecutors previously has had to say about lt col norths 
credibility poindexters lawyers said in court papers 
us district court judge harold greene has not indicated when 
he will rule on poindexters request to introduce the prosecutors 
contention that north committed perjury 
poindexters trial continues today with the jury scheduled to 
finish watching eight hours of videotaped testimony by former 
president reagan 
when north testified in poindexters trial he said he could not 
recall details he provided at his own trial prosecutors responded 
by repeatedly referring the witness back to his damaging statements 
last year about poindexter 
it would be totally unfair to allow the prosecutor to argue 
that lt col norths testimony at his own trial was more 
believable than his testimony at this proceeding the defense 
said in its court papers 
in 1989 north testified in detail about poindexter sending him 
to a meeting with congressmen where north lied about his 
contrarelated activities north denied that he was assisting the 
rebels militarily or raising money for them 
i felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants 
north testified 
at poindexters trial norths testimony on the meeting with 
congressmen was more equivocal and the former white house aide 
emphasized that nobody had told him to lie 
meanwhile poindexter lost a court fight wednesday over reagans 
diaries as the defense began showing reagans videotaped testimony 
to the jury 
greene said reagan does not have to produce diary entries sought 
by his onetime national security adviser 
poindexter said he needed the excerpts because reagan in his 
taped testimony professed a total inability to recall the 
diversion of iran arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan contras and 
a 1985 hawk missile shipment 
greene said the entries which he has read offer no new 
insights about these events

secretary of state james a baker 
iii today told south african officials they must end a nearly 
4yearold state of emergency before washington lifts sanctions 
against the whiteled government 
baker met with an african national congress delegation which 
criticized the first visit in 12 years by a us secretary of state 
on the ground that it gives the governments reform program 
legitimacy that the black antiapartheid group feels has not been 
earned 
despite protest by the anc baker then met with president fw 
de klerk who said he did not consider bakers visit a reward for 
recent reforms but proof of the interest which america has in 
this region 
de klerk said he and baker discussed civil wars in neighboring 
angola and mozambique as well as developments inside south africa 
but not sanctions 
baker said de klerk told him pretoria wants to end the national 
state of emergency in effect since june 1986 and free political 
prisoners 
after an earlier luncheon meeting with foreign minister pik 
botha baker said he discussed the emergency noting that its 
lifting was one of the conditions set by the us congress for 
ending economic sanctions 
baker said the us government hoped that the state of emergency 
would be ended at an appropriate time consistent of course 
with the maintenance of law and order 
we approve of the direction that the government has recently 
been moving in baker said 
the pretoria government last month released black nationalist 
leader nelson mandela after 27 years of imprisonment and legalized 
the anc and other groups 
the state of emergency however allows police to detain people 
indefinitely without trial outlaw certain forms of protest and 
subject the news media to various restrictions 
botha said the south african government wants to end the state 
of emergency as soon as the level of political violence in the 
country is brought down we dont want it he said of the 
nearly 4yearold state of emergency it is bad for us our name 
abroad our reputation 
govan mbeki a member of the ancs national executive said 
after his delegations 90minute meeting with baker today we are 
not happy with the fact that he has come here to consult with the 
south african government 
mbeki said the anc wants a complete cut in diplomatic contacts 
with the south african government 
mandela on wednesday asked baker not to meet with de klerk the 
african national congress deputy president said the meeting would 
send an inaccurate message that south africa has made meaningful 
changes 
the secretary met with mandela in namibia because mandela 
refused to meet with him in south africa but mbeki and two of 
mandelas other codefendants sentenced to life in prison with him 
met with baker in cape town 
and walter sisulu the internal leader of the anc in south 
africa planned to meet with baker on friday in soweto outside 
johannesburg 
baker said the meeting today with 11 members of the african 
national congress and its ally the united democratic front 
produced more agreement than disagreement the fact is we share 
the same goals said baker 
mbeki said the united states is probably the most powerful 
country in the world and would necessarily have a great impact on 
happenings in south africa depending on how it uses that position 
of power 
the american government and the american people should 
continue to impose pressures on the south african government and 
not relax at all until such time as the position will have to be 
made clear that the south african government has no way of going 
backwards said mbeki who was freed in 1987 from a life prison 
term for planning the ancs guerrillasabotage campaign 
sisulu and the other codefendants were freed in october and 
mandela was freed in february after de klerk legalized the anc and 
59 other organizations to encourage black leaders to negotiate with 
the government on a new constitution and an end to apartheid 
mandela will lead an anc delegation in talks with de klerk in cape 
town on april 11

bush was asked about gorbachevs order the day before requiring 
lithuanian citizens to turn over their guns to soviet authorities 
in seven days 
he passed up an opportunity to criticize the order and said he 
was certain neither side in the conflict wanted to see force used 
bush said he takes soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
at his word in his assurances earlier this week that the kremlin 
would not use force to block lithuanian independence 
we do not recognize the incorporation of lithuania into the 
soviet uniin however there are certain realities in life 
lithuanians are well aware of them and they should talk as they 
are to the soviet officials about these differences bush said 
the administration has steadfastly underscored its position that 
the united states has never recognized the forced incorporation of 
lithuania and the other baltic states of estonia and latvia 
however the united states has not extended formal diplomatic 
recognition to lithuania in the aftermath of its march 11 
declaration of independence 
the president at a wideranging news conference that lasted 
half an hour also said he would like to see all soviet troops 
removed from poland 
bush said he will not go to nicaragua on april 25 for the 
inauguration of violeta chamorro but that he hoped to visit a 
number of latin american countries in the fall the president also 
said he hopes to be able to accept an invitation from australian 
prime minister bob hawke to visit australia although he did not 
indicate when he would take the trip

speaker thomas foley said today he expects the 
house to approve legislation next week that would provide federal 
assistance to families for child care including care provided by 
churchsponsored centers 
foley dwash said house debate had been set for wednesday on 
a childcare bill which had been held up while democratic leaders 
worked in private to resolve differences within the party over 
churchsponsored care 
although democrats still have not produced a written version of 
their bill foley said lbbying on its behalf 
rep bob walker rpa said the christian broadcasting network 
televised a number for its viewers to call members of congress to 
lobby against such a ban during a show hosted by former republican 
presidential candidate pat robertson 
its working walker said 
that bill is more ambitious than what president bush has 
proposed but the administrations endorsement did not come as a 
surprise to democrats the white house had backed stenholm in 
similar debates last year 
the stenholmshaw version would cost an estimated 193 billion 
over its fiveyear phasein period that is less than more 
ambitious democratic versions would cost although democratic 
leaders have yet to produce their latest version in writing 
democratic leaders earlier agreed to combine competing proposals 
to expand tax credits for lowincome families for day care and 
increase funding for daycare services under a block grant program 
other provisions would expand head start and increase a 
schoolbased program of before and afterschool care 
the stenholmshaw version backed by the white house is similar 
to one narrowly defeated by the house last fall 
it would increase money for head start and the social security 
block grants and expand the earned income tax credit for lowincome 
families 
it would not include the schoolbased program however and 
would eliminate the existing childcare tax credit for highincome 
families it would scrap requirements for government childcare 
standards 
the house last year gave tentative approval to competing 
versions one emphasizing block grants and the other establishing 
new direct aid programs house and senate negotiators agreed later 
on the new direct aid programs but supporters of block grants 
balked and foley refused to allow a partydividing fight over the 
issue on the house floor

your chances of getting a telephoned tax 
question answered correctly by the irs are considerably better this 
year but you will have more difficulty getting your call answered 
at all auditors said today 
this year irs assistors have responded accurately to 78 
percent of our taxlaw questions compared to 66 percent for the 
same questions last year jennie s stathis of the general 
accounting office told the house ways and means oversight 
subcommittee 
but taxpayers are having more difficulty reaching an irs 
assistor she said this year irs is answering one out of three 
calls last year it answered almost two of three 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr blamed the problem on the 
fact the internal revenue service is under a hiring freeze and has 
been forced to cut training and the number of tollfree telphone 
lines it bothers the hell out of me that taxpayer service has 
declined that way he said 
earlier today goldberg acknowledged the irs is making mistakes 
when it bills americans for additional taxes and penalties but 
denied the problem is as big as a magazine story indicates 
money magazine suggested there is a 5050 chance the internal 
revenue service will make a mistake the next time it sends out a 
bill for additonal taxes and penalties the magazine said there is 
evidence that 7 billion of the 153 billion collected as a result 
of such letters last year was not really owed 
that 15 billion i think is pretty much due and owing 
goldberg said today on abcs good morning america 
but he added sure people pay money they may not owe we 
make mistakes 
the commissioner agreed with the magazines advice that if the 
irs makes a mistake the taxpayer should fight it grab us by the 
neck and tell us goldberg said 
in the cover story of its april edition money cited a report by 
the general accounting office interviews with tax lawyers and 
accountants and a survey of its subscribers to conclude that half 
the 36 million bills for taxes and penalties mailed out last year 
contained errors 
the form letters generated 153 billion last year an average 
of 425 per notice money noted 
yet behind that apparent triumph of tax law microenforcement 
lurks a sloppy little secret a convincing case can be made that at 
least 7 billion of that money should never have been collected at 
all because around half of those imposing official notices were 
inaccurate the magazine said 
clearly individuals are caving in to questionable demands for 
more money that would propel them to the phone in a second if the 
bill came from some bank or creditcard company 
although irs officials quarreled with moneys figures the 
agency acknowledges wholesale employee errors in answering 
taxpayers telephoned questions and in processing returns 
in fact irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr cited the 
processing errors in testimony before a house subcommittee earlier 
this month while pleading for money to modernize the agencys 
1960svintage computer system 
the net result will be fewer erroneous notices and levies 
property seizures which cost both irs and taxpayers time and 
money to resolve and will allow us to devote our resources to 
truly delinquent accounts goldberg said 
more than 35 percent of the irs notices of additional taxes and 
penalties allege mathematical errors late returns failure to pay 
tax on some wages interest or dividend reported by an employer or 
bank or underpayment of quarterly estimated taxes 
last month money polled 300 of its subscribers with a median 
income over 52000 a year and found that at sometime in their 
lives half had received irs bills for more taxes and penalties 
seven of 10 fought back 
a stunning 45 percent of those who contested their notices 
report that the irs claims were totally incorrect and an additional 
24 percent said that they were at least partially wrong the 
magazine wrote whats more of those who challenged the irs on 
their own 53 percent wound up paying nothing and another 17 
percent succeeded in getting the bill reduced 
the telephone poll had an error margin of plus or minus six 
percentage points 
money blamed the irs error rate on outmoded computers and poorly 
trained lowpaid workers the clerks who type data from tax 
returns into computers at the agencys 10 regional service centers 
and the examiners who manage the notices and followup letters 
the magazine said squalid working conditions in some irs 
facilities including the big andover mass service center and 
the manhattan district office cut deeply into employee morale and 
increase the error rate 
the story suggested three reasons why taxpayers coughed up the 
money they did not owe 
simple undifferentiated fear of fighting the irs is infamous 
for starchamber audits summary confiscation of property and 
allseeing imperious independence 
the notices tend to be confusing compounding the maddening 
complexity of tax law itself the magazine quoted irs ombudsman 
damon o holmes as saying the notices are intelligible only to the 
people who wrote them 
tax professionals attest that all too many intimidated 
taxpayers fear that if they dont pay they will suffer far worse 
they begin to imagine that the irs will come to audit them and 
perhaps end up questioning all sorts of deductions in the process 
the magazine offered this advice for taxpayers unfairly dunned 
by the irs never ignore an irs notice respond quickly in sharp 
but simple terms follow up forcefully and get outside help if 
necessary

president bush said today hes got some 
opinions about running against women candidates but he wont say 
what they are 
bush called himself an expert in the field referring to his 
1984 vice presidential race against then rep geraldine ferraro 
he was asked at a news conference if he had any advice for 
clayton williams the republican gubernatorial candidate in texas 
whose opponent will be decided in a runoff between democratic state 
treasurer ann richards and attorney gen jim mattox 
williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against 
a woman 
as for presidential advice bush retorted 
i have none at all but i know exactly what he means and i 
refuse to elaborate on it because it could end up complicating 
his life he said 
remember 1984 i cant forget it 
williams he said is entitled to his opinion maybe hes 
drawing on my experience 
bush had a hard time competing with the wave of positive feeling 
ferraros candidacy initially generated among women 
when at last he felt he had made a strong showing against her in 
a televised debate bush stated he had kicked a little ass with 
his performance

most part were uninsured for floods 
the town was inundated saturday when a levee along the pea river 
burst after the region was pummeled with up to 16 inches of rain 
across the south the flooding forced hundreds to be evacuated and 
was blamed for at least 11 deaths 
bush declared coffee county which includes elba a disaster 
area making citizens eligible for loans and other aid 
now that the flood waters in coffee county have receded we 
have a big job ahead of us gov guy hunt said the white house 
took no immediate action on hunts request for disaster 
declarations in 25 other alabama counties 
in florida flooding along several rivers across the panhandle 
caused about 2500 residents to flee the latest evacuations were 
on the lower choctawhatchee not expected to crest until later 
today 
in caryville fla and surrounding washington county about 100 
miles west of tallahassee 1200 were forced to flee their homes 
since the weekend 
theres not one place dry in town that ive seen said 
caryville resident hershel carnley theres not much you can 
say its a mess everybody in town is hurting 
in hawkinsville ga civil defense director sam clark said the 
last family was evacuated by boat from one threatened area before 
dawn wednesday national weather service forecasters predicted the 
ocmulgee river will crest at 7 feet above flood stage friday in the 
southcentral georgia town 
i had talked like a madman trying to get them to leave but 
they wouldnt clark said they called about 330 for us to

a toxin similar to red tide could have caused 
the mysterious deaths of as many as 680 endangered sea turtles off 
colombia officials said 
only a few thousand adult pacific green turtles are known to 
exist so the beaching represents the loss of a substantial part of 
the population said jack woody national sea turtle coordinator 
for the us fish and wildlife service in albuquerque nm 
some have suggested that the turtles beached themselves as 
whales sometimes do 
colombian fishermen attributed the deaths to a curse put on them 
for over exploiting the seas resources said roderic mast 
director of species conservation at conservation international in 
washington dc 
the turtles eat plant material and some could have contained 
toxins mast said wednesday 
maybe they were affected by a red tide or something like 
that he said 
another explanation could be that the turtles were caught in 
fishermens nets and drowned mast said 
the local fishermen who are the people who of course know the 
area best are claiming theyve never seen anything like this 
before mast said 
the likely cause in my opinion is probably drowning in 
trawlers nets with the carcasses thrown overboard 
on the other hand he said these things dont add up because 
if they were poor fishermen you would expect them to keep the 
turtles there is a lot of good meat and oil there 
if the turtles died of natural causes the conditions that 
killed them could threaten other endangered turtles in the pacific 
mast said unconfirmed sightings suggest that might be happening 
there are reports of turtle dieoffs for no apparent reason in 
other parts of the pacific indicating that something may be going 
on that needs further research he said 
some of those reports are coming from the national marine 
fisheries service which is taking a count of dolphins and 
porpoises in the pacific said woody 
this year they have seen some number of dead turtles floating 
at sea he said losing these animals and not knowing why is a 
worrisome problem 
ninetyeight percent of the turtles that washed ashore in 
colombia were pacific green turtles mast said 
they are the second most endangered sea turtles in the world 
after the kemps ridleys said woody 
theyre in tough shape he said 
anne meylan a specialist with the florida natural resources 
department in st petersburg said the smithsonian tropical 
research institute in panama has received reports from fishermen of 
dead turtles washing up on the pacific coast of panama and floating 
at sea 
the deaths occurred about early december said argelis ruiz 
guevara a biology student at the institute who has been monitoring 
the reports she said she could not determine how many had died 
the colombian turtle beaching occurred in february according to 
mast who has just released details of a preliminary investigation 
of the beaching he said he has been receiving regular reports from 
diego amorocho a biologist with the nature foundation in the 
colombian capital bogota 
amorocho with the financial backing of conservation 
international and the us fish and wildlife service reported 
taking a census of some of the dead turtles along 200 miles of 
beaches in northwestern colombia 
amorocho estimated that 360 to 680 turtles had washed ashore 
over a period of one or two days 
conservation international and the fish and wildlife service are 
paying for studies to try to determine the cause of death mast 
said

if grand island cant be the biggest 
then it says its going to be the best 
after grand islands claim of being the worlds largest 
freshwater island was shot down a few weeks ago by a buffalo 
newspaper columnist town officials found a solution they crossed 
out the word largest on a recently erected roadway sign and 
replaced it with best 
take that ilha de marajo 
the controversy began when the columnist saw the sign did some 
research and found that the brazilian island in the mouth of the 
amazon river is 500 times larger than grand island and that the 
great lakes alone have 10 larger freshwater islands 
let the island in the amazon dispute this robert w weaver 
a grand island chamber of commerce director said after the sign 
was edited wednesday 
weaver said he wasnt remorseful about the original mistake i 
would do it all over again it created a lot of controversy and 
interest and i think it brought grand island to the minds of many 
people who dont think about it 
the 27squaremile island lies between the two branches of the 
niagara river a few miles northwest of buffalo

a major oil spill such as the one that 
devastated alaskas prince william sound a year ago could strike 
new york or los angeles harbor two environmental groups said 
thursday 
one group the center for marine conservation also said spills 
are almost inevitable in the ecologically rich florida keys 
the center and the natural resources defense council in 
separate studies undertaken after the exxon valdez spill in alaska 
called for tighter standards governing tankers pilots and tug 
escorts 
the center suggested that the coast guard establish a network 
much like the airtraffic control system to monitor traffic off 
the florida keys and the central california coast and advise 
mariners of danger spots 
the tanker exxon valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of 
toxic crude oil into the sea when it ran aground in prince william 
sound a year ago saturday soaking 1100 miles of scenic coastland 
searchers found 34400 dead birds and believe at least 1000 sea 
otters and countless other animals died 
an exxon valdezsize spill could occur in new york harbor 
the natural resources defense council concluded saying 18 billion 
gallons of oil are brought into the harbor each year and large 
spills have dumped more than 24 million gallons into harbor waters 
in the last 13 years 
the report drew the same conclusion about los angeles harbor 
where it said supertankers regularly arrive carrying 33 million 
gallons of oil it said more than 13 million gallons of oil and 
fuel have spilled into the los angeles harbor area from major and 
medium spills since 1976 
in a case study of san francisco bay the center said the coast 
guard regards it as more difficult to navigate than prince william 
sound and noted that it contains 90 percent of californias coastal 
wetlands the entrance to the bay is ringed with national parkland 
and existing and proposed marine sanctuaries 
the study said tanker traffic is heavy and rising and will 
increase by at least 25 percent if federal plans to lease northern 
and central california offshore areas for oil drilling are approved 
the center for marine conservation said there have been no major 
oil spills in the florida keys for many years except for a spill 
off the marquesas in 1975 from which oil was driven ashore on a 
30mile stretch of the keys 
yet the great number of tankers and other vessels transiting 
the florida straits makes spills a near inevitability given 
historical patterns of tanker casualties the center said 
the center urged that the coast guard control traffic within 15 
miles of the keys where a series of vessel groundings late last 
year extensively damaged coral reefs 
we have the knowhow to prevent accidents before they happen 
especially in our most sensitive waters said roger mcmanus 
president of the center 
among other principal recommendations in the two reports are 
requiring oil tankers and barges to have double hulls and 
double bottoms 
requiring tug escorts for tankers in difficult waters and 
biologically sensitive areas 
establishing tankerfree zones in environmentally vulnerable 
areas 
requiring licensed pilots for all tankers and barges over a a 
minimum size within harbors

president bush said today there is just a 
nuance of difference with poland over its demands for a signed 
treaty guaranteeing its border before the two germanys unite 
bush in a news conference shortly after a second round of talks 
with polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki said the poles and 
germans are very very close now to an understanding that the 
current borders must remain intact 
let them sort it out its going very well bush told 
reporters 
he said again that poland will have a voice at the twoplusfour 
talks on questions affecting its borders and stressed that those 
talks are not going to determine the fate of all of europe 
mazowiecki left the white house saying there are no problems 
between us on polands demand for an early treaty with the two 
germanys guaranteeing its borders 
bush said he had not gotten any assurances from mazowiecki that 
the new noncommunist government in warsaw will press for 
withdrawal of soviet troops from its territory 
there isnt any need for soviet troops in eastern europe and 
the sooner they get out of there the better said bush 
mazowiecki has said he wants the soviet troops to stay until the 
german question is resolved the prime minister speaking with 
reporters as he left the white house said weve stated publicly 
were going to start talks about that that will eventually lead to 
total withdrawal of the soviet forces 
on the socalled twoplusfour talks on german unification 
involving the two germanys and the four allied victors from world 
war ii bush said if the talks involve polish issues poland 
should be there poland should be involved 
we dont see this as the group that is going to determine the 
fate of all of europe but if twoplusfour starts talking 
about polish borders for example clearly the poles should be 
involved the president said 
mazowiecki said he was very pleased with his talks with bush 
there are no problems between us on polands demand for an 
early swift treaty with the two germanys guaranteeing its borders 
the prime minister said 
the only problem is to persuade both our german partners that 
it needs to be done swiftly and finally said mazowiecki who 
wants a guarantee in writing that a united germany will not seek to 
reclaim territories ceded to poland after world war ii 
asked if he and bush had solved disagreements over how large a 
role poland should have in the talks mazowiecki replied it is 
well known that we will participate in the conference and we will 
take part in everything that will affect and concern ourselves 
poland has been assured a seat at the table when the two 
germanys and the four allied victors from world war ii the united 
states britain france and the soviet union discuss issues 
affecting the polish border 
mazowiecki said the poles want a treaty with the germanys 
initialed prior to the german unification and finally reaffirmed 
after the unification 
we do not really see any major reason why that should not 
happen because we want that to happen to make sure that the whole 
debate would not have to be started all over again afterwards we 
would like to avoid this he said 
we know that after all were going to live as neighbors with a 
unified germany from now on and we would like to see it as a good 
neighborly relationship he said 
mazowiecki then left for capitol hill and talks with leaders of 
both the house and senate 
at a state dinner wednesday night mazowiecki pressed his 
insistence on a new treaty guaranteeing polands border and urged a 
new political structure to free europe of military rivalry 
earlier wednesday bush sought to assure mazowiecki of us 
support for polands demand that its current western border not be 
breached when the two germanys unite 
both in private talks and in a poignant toast at the state 
dinner mazowiecki stressed the issues importance to poles now 
emerging from a long night of totalitarian oppression under the 
nazis and then communist rule 
at the state dinner mazowiecki invoked alexis de tocquevilles 
words about the unstoppable march of democracy 
nowadays were witnessing an enormous acceleration of that 
march in nicaragua chile even mongolia but most of all in 
eastern and central europe he said democracy is a system 
which secures the freedom of the individual the freedom without 
which no normal life is possible 
he recalled how poland was ravaged by the nazi invasion in 
1939 
our people suffered more than any other on earth poland lost 
6 million of its citizens half of them polish jews he said 
after world war ii he said for the next 45 years we were 
forced to live under an alien political system a totalitarian one 
which was imposed on the whole eastern and central europe the 
poles never accepted their fate and were the first to challenge 
it 
mazowiecki said a need is emerging for a new structure to 
gradually free europe of military rivalry and bring the two 
separated parts closer together 
reconciliation between nations is possible only when they do 
not fear either for their present or their future for this reason 
an important component of the building must be the recognition of 
the polish border along the oderneisse rivers in the form of a 
treaty said the prime minister

america is postponing the day of reckoning 
with its deteriorating road bridge and water network driving the 
eventual repair pricetag even higher congress was told thursday 
while theres little argument it will cost billions of dollars 
to fix the system no consensus has been reached on how to raise 
the money said the office of technology assessment 
as a country we must face the fact that there is no free 
lunch said edith p page the studys project director the 
bad news is we found no silver bullet 
the choices are clear the report said all levels of 
government will have to raise taxes and a variety of fees to pay 
for public works improvements or they will have to eliminate or 
reduce services 
the house and senate public works committees commissioned the 
study and the congressional research office produced a 140page 
report painting a grim picture of transportation and water systems 
weve had a series of reports on this subject each of which 
has been greeted with massive indifference said sen daniel p 
moynihan dny who joined ota officials at a news conference 
i am baffled by this were on the edge at least of 
disinvesting in public works he said 
the report described a public works network fallen into 
disrepair making it difficult for people to get to and from work 
discouraging new plant construction and generally stifling the easy 
movement of products to the marketplace 
a variety of circumstances has conspired to leave the system in 
poor shape the study said including a declining political 
consensus for public works expenditures at all levels of government 
the problem has worsened over the last decade as federal grants 
to states have waned local officials have been reluctant to hike 
taxes and washington has imposed costly new environmental and 
health regulations on industry it said 
two weeks ago president bush announced a national 
transportation policy that would shift more costs to state and 
local governments calling for more toll roads local gas taxes and 
user fees the plan was criticized by some local government 
officials who said their budgets already were stretched to the 
limit 
breaking the logjam created by these issues is no simple 
matter ms page said adding 
although states have increased their investments in public 
works as federal support has dwindled for a variety of reasons no 
state has filled the gap between its infrastructure needs and 
reductions in federal support 
we dont understand that running down the capital 
infrastructure adds to the costs of production she said 
said sen steve symms ridaho we concentrate on efforts in 
raising the costs of doing business in the united states instead of 
lowering the costs of doing business by rebuilding the 
infrastructure 
this disinvestment is going to cost us a lot of money as it 
causes sagging productivity he said 
the study said the nations roughly 83000 local governments 
are in an unenviable position they take the direct political 
heat generated by public works issues 
the ota report made no effort to say how much it would cost to 
repair and modernize aging and deteriorating public works 
facilities but it noted one recent economic projection that if 
spending were increased by 50 billion in the first year 1 
percent of the gross national product productivity would rise 
by 265 billion

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev demanded 
today that lithuania stop a signup of volunteer forces to protect 
the baltic republics declaration of independence 
in another move to increase pressure on officials who led the 
republic to declare independence on march 11 gorbachev told 
lithuanian president vytautus landsbergis to report back on the 
matter in two days 
in a telegram the text of which was read on the evening tv news 
program vremya gorbachev that volunteers must not be signed up 
in lithuania to take the place of soviet border guards and police 
he called on landsbergis to take urgent measures to stop all 
activity aimed at creating these kinds of organizations and 
called for a response in two days 
on wednesday gorbachev ordered lithuanian citizens to turn in 
all their firearms and ordered a strengthened border regime around

the daily number of east germans 
resettling in west germany has dropped in half in the past week 
apparently as a result of the national elections held in their 
homeland the interior ministry said thursday 
the ministry said 931 east german resettlers registered with 
federal authorities on wednesday compared with 2248 one week ago 
it was the lowest figure in several months the ministry said 
on tuesday 1156 east germans applied for permanent residence 
in west germany and on monday the number was 1539 said the 
interior ministry 
in recent weeks the daily number of new arrivals often 
surpassed 2000 
about 150000 east germans have arrived in west germany since 
the beginning of the year joining more than 340000 who made the 
trip last year 
the exodus sparked the revolution for democratic reform that led 
to elections sunday in east germany at the same time it has bled 
east germanys struggling economy and placed severe burdens on west 
germanys social services net and housing and job markets 
but the constant stream appears to be ebbing as a result of 
sundays vote in which an alliance favoring quick reunification 
with west germany won the most votes 
the decrease may also be a result of west germanys decision 
tuesday to end a 40yearold program that provided shelter 
lowinterest loans and startingout money for east german 
resettlers 
on thursday the government took yet another step to discourage 
east germans from heading permanently west 
starting next week east germans who quit their jobs at home to 
move west will have to wait three months before they can qualify 
for west german unemployment benefits 
previously there was no waiting period for the unemployment 
money

a column of soviet armored personnel 
carriers and army trucks drove through the center of the lithuanian 
capital today in the kremlins latest show of force in the 
breakaway republic 
lithuanian officials protested increased soviet military 
activity and president mikhail s gorbachevs decree wednesday 
ordering citizens to turn in their guns saying the republics 
independence movement has been nonviolent 
gorbachev today also demanded that lithuania stop signing up 
volunteer defense forces the request came in a telegram to 
lithuanian president vytautus landsbergis and was read on the 
evening tv news program vremya 
a convoy of 15 personnel carriers and five trucks towing 
military equipment rolled through vilnius this afternoon 
the action came just hours after lithuanian prime minister 
kazimiera prunskiene complained of the increasing activity of 
soviet soldiers and demanded an explanation from the kremlin 
during a break in todays supreme council session she told 
reporters an estimated 30000 soviet troops were stationed in the 
republic whose parliament declared independence from moscow on 
march 11 after the ruling communists were removed from power in 
free elections 
but it changes daily she said explaining why she sent a 
telegram to gorbachev on wednesday night demanding to know the 
number of soviet troops and amount of military equipment sent to 
lithuania over the past few days 
gorbachev has called lithuanias declaration of independence 
illegal but has also said he would not use force to keep it from 
seceding from the soviet union which annexed the republic after 
assuming control under terms of the hitlerstalin pact of 1940 
ms prunskiene called gorbachevs decree to turn in weapons 
within a week an expression of mistrust in the whole population 
of the baltic state 
lithuanian interior minister marionis myasyukonis told the 
associated press there are about 30000 officially registered 
shotguns mostly in the possession of hunters and collectors 
there has not been one case of aggression so why confiscate 
shotguns said lithuanian legislator algimontas cekuolis the 
laws of moscow are not valid in the sovereign state of lithuania 
no guns will be returned 
landsbergis said gorbachevs decree shows the ghost of 
stalinism is walking in the kremlin and that it could be enforced 
only by brutal military force 
gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
reiterated today that moscow had no plans to use force but declined 
to say whether the kremlin might order the arrest of lithuanian 
leaders 
we want to solve this problem as peacefully as possible and 
according to the laws of the country he told reporters during a 
news briefing 
the soviet general who commands lithuanias volunteer civil 
defense agency said he has partially complied with orders to turn 
over to the soviet military the weapons and 16000 vehicles under 
his command 
gen ginutis taurinskas told the lithuanian parliament he was 
ordered to give all small caliber weapons to military units so 
there wont be any eventual theft of arms for inappropriate use 
he said firearms remained scattered among 500 to 600 units of 
volunteers who carry out air raid drills and train young people for 
military service he gave no figures 
gorbachev using the powers he gained when the congress of 
peoples deputies elected him the soviet unions first executive 
president last week said lithuanians had a week to turn in their 
firearms 
if they fail to do so he said the soviet interior ministry 
should be prepared to confiscate them 
gorbachev also told kgb border troops to tighten their watch 
over the republic and told officials to reduce the number of visas 
issued to foreigners seeking to visit the republic 
his decree was the latest in a series of increasingly tough 
moves taken by moscow in an attempt to discourage secession by the 
republic of 38 million people 
it came less than 24 hours after a strong protest from 
lithuanias government over stepped up maneuvers by the soviet 
military in the state 
lithuanias was independent from 1918 until 1940 when it was 
forcibly annexed along with latvia and estonia so far no foreign 
country has officially recognized lithuania as independent 
lithuania had rushed to declare its independence before 
gorbachev could gain broad powers that include authority to impose 
direct presidential rule on areas of the soviet union 
asked late wednesday whether gorbachev was conducting 
psychological warfare on the small republic cekuolis said yes 
this is a war of nerves but we are not nervous we have the 
motivation we have our country and we know where we are going 
most firearms are tightly controlled in the soviet union so 
gorbachevs directive primarily touched hunting weapons relatively 
few people own firearms and they must be registered with 
authorities 
also wednesday moscow lawmakers gave initial approval to a 
draft law that would make secession from the soviet union illegal 
without a republicwide referendum and a fiveyear transition 
period 
one of two chambers in the supreme soviet standing legislature 
gave the bill preliminary approval and sent it to the other chamber 
deputies said its prompt passage was needed to dissuade other 
republics from copying lithuania as fellow baltic republics latvia 
and estonia are expected to do 
a group of conservative deputies to the congress appealed to 
gorbachev to impose direct rule on lithuania charging that the 
republic was about to pass legislation making it illegal to speak 
out against the independence movement 
senior lithuanian legislators confirmed such legislation 
existed but said it was unlikely to be approved by lithuanias 
parliament

every building street leaf or scrap 
of earth in this town of 10000 is black shrouded in the soot of 
some of eastern europes worst pollution 
each year copsa micas two factories spew out about 30000 tons 
of pollutants some of it is soot from a factory that puts dye in 
rubber some is dust from a plant for nonferrous metals 
everybody has known for years it was bad to live here but under 
the dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu nobody dared say so 
residents say the pollution problem was acknowledged only when 
ceausescus son nicu visited the town for two days last fall and 
the factories were shut down 
the situation in copsa mica is in some ways typical of 
industrial areas in other eastern european countries where 
communist governments eager for industrial development ignored 
environmental damage 
now millions of people in east germany poland czechoslovakia 
bulgaria hungary and romania are using their new freedoms to 
expose one of the legacies of stalinism destruction of the 
environment in economies run by decree rather than logic 
as eastern europe rediscovers its political voice ecological 
movements and greens parties are becoming important 
in czechoslovakia for instance where an estimated 35 percent 
of all forests are damaged by pollution sulfur dioxide emissions 
are double those in neighboring west germany the greens party 
ranks second in the polls behind civic forum and public against 
violence movements that led the peaceful revolution against 
communist rule 
in romania too an emerging national ecology movement claims at 
least 40000 active supporters even before mays scheduled 
elections the provisional government has set commissions to battle 
the blight imposed by ceausescus rule 
ceausescu ordered the building of big factories but when it 
was a question of buying antipollution devices he never accepted 
that said architect serban popescucriveanu chairman of one of 
the new national bodies 
he said lets start and well do that later and that later 
meant never 
similarly haphazard planning and the resulting pollution helped 
bring about last falls revolt in east germany home of some of 
central europes dirtiest industrial towns 
in bulgaria in 1988 it was environmental dissent and a 
government crackdown on it that sowed the seeds of todays broader 
opposition to the communists 
in hungary poland and the soviet union environmental awareness 
helped start political reforms that in turn have heightened public 
consciousness of pollution it is a touchstone issue in 
traditionally rural countries whose folklore values the peasant 
customs forests lakes and clean air that vanished under communism 
despite the easts growing environmental awareness the cost of 
cleaning up the mess lack of international cooperation and a 
threat of unemployment mean that any improvement will take decades 
hungary for instance decided in 1982 to become the first east 
bloc country to control toxic waste that previously was buried in 
unregulated dumps which environment official robert reiniger calls 
ticking timebombs 
the one waste burner put into operation since 1982 cost 367 
million including more than 2 million in hard currency in a 
country that needs every cent to repay its 20 billion foreign debt 
on the international scale costs are far higher a recent study 
by the international institute for applied systems analysis near 
vienna estimated that 18 billion a year would be needed to cut by 
50 percent the sulfurous emissions eating at europes forests 
even that huge investment wont arrest the acidification of 
europes soils unless the money is used chiefly to curb the air 
pollution from its chief sources in eastern europe the institutes 
experts say 
yet crossborder cooperation is hard to achieve czechoslovakia 
and hungary for instance still cannot decide the fate of a giant 
halfcompleted plan to dam and rechannel the danube river for 
hydroelectric plants but both countries now agree potential energy 
gains should be weighed against possibly lasting damage to land and 
wildlife 
while governments seem to fear losing the huge sums already 
spent on projects such as the danube dam workers worry about 
losing their livelihood if industries are closed 
when romanias new government closed a wellknown national 
eyesore a synthetic materials plant in the northern town of 
suceava hundreds of its workers traveled to bucharest to protest 
communisms failure to keep its promises of a better life for 
its people mean that many of eastern europes new voters like the 
east germans last weekend favor parties who offer economic growth 
while new wealth may help curb some existing pollution it could 
create new environmental damage by increasing demands for energy in 
countries with few natural fuel resources and growing appetites for 
consumer goods 
in budapest for instance the growth in private car ownership 
means clogged city streets but it also means the incidence of 
asthma has doubled in the last 10 years in one busy district where 
lead content in the air is 18 times what it should be

prime minister bob hawke seeks a record 
fourth consecutive victory for his governing labor party in the 
election saturday which he says will set australias course into 
the 21st century 
when he set the date feb 16 hawke said it was the most 
important election in more than 40 years 
hawke in office seven years is the most enduring and popular 
labor party leader polls forecast a close vote between labor and 
the opposition liberalnational party coalition but no contest 
when it comes to the prime ministers personal popularity 
bulletin magazine said a survey conducted last weekend indicated 
43 percent of the voters supported labor and the opposition 
alliance led by andrew peacock of the liberal party had edged up 
a point to 39 percent 
it said 14 percent supported the centrist environmentalist 
australian democrats the greatest following the party has achieved 
australia has 106 million eligible voters among its 165 
million people and voting is compulsory 
the magazine said 2492 people across australia were questioned 
it did not give the margin of error 
foreign policy is unlikely to change regardless of who wins the 
election labor and the opposition alliance have similar positions 
and support continued close relations with the united states 
little controversy arose during the campaign and newspapers 
described it as the dullest of recent times 
the liberal sydney morning herald said hawke and peacock have 
the combined charisma of a wet salad sandwich the tabloid daily 
telegraph of sydney asked excuse us but has anyone seen the 
election campaign 
labor ran on its record of economic management despite a 
foreign debt equivalent to 100 billion and record 18 percent 
interest rates that hurt home buyers and small businesses 
a daily telegraph editorial said the federal election 
campaign is drifting on an ocean of apathy because so many 
australian families are drowning in a sea of debt and feel they are 
living in a sinking country 
i believe the election is the most important one since 1949 
the 60yearold prime minister said when the campaign began 
referring to a labor loss that began 23 years in power for the 
liberals 
the election will essentially determine the character of the 
nation that we are going to have in the 21st century hawke said 
peacock 51 predicts a 16seat victory in the 148seat house of 
representatives he has asked australians to dump labor for a 
government that will help the battlers as australians call 
poorer working people 
in the current house labor has 85 seats the liberal party has 
45 seats and its coalition partner the national party has 18 
seats 
a former foreign minister peacock is making his second attempt 
to become prime minister a poll conducted by the newspaper 
melbourne age indicated he trailed hawke in personal popularity 
with 23 percent to hawkes 52 percent 
hawke became prime minister in 1983 he won elections the 
following year and in 1987 and hopes to carry a fifth for labor 
before retiring the term in australia is three years

united states says produced chemical weapons before it was damaged 
by fire last week

chemical company was charged with violating west germanys export 
laws and with tax evasion

payments to west german firms and interrupted trade claiming west 
german intelligence was involved in the fire west germany denied 
the accusation and issued a formal protest over the suspension of 
payments

created a special rabta unit consisting of 20 officials who 
took part in the investigation

confiscated in the investigation and that statements were taken 
from more than 200 witnesses

officials reported libya has blocked trade with west germany 
since last week to protest the fire which caused severe damage 
to the plant 
libyan exports to west germany last year amounted to 185 
billion most of it oil west german exports to libya last year 
were valued at 780 million

the speaker of the legislature broke his 
walnut gavel but he still needed the attention of his 48 
colleagues so he wielded a meat cleaver thursday 
and members of the unicameral legislature paid attention 
after two days of heated debate a school financing bill had 
just been passed wednesday when speaker bill barrett began his 
annual get serious speech about what he expected during the 
last 10 working days of the twomonth session 
he banged the gavel to quiet the noisy chamber and the handle of 
the walnut hammer split throwing the heavy head to the floor with 
an extra crash 
undaunted the ever businesslike barrett continued 
there are those of you who are concerned that your priority 
bills may not be handled and thats entirely possible even 
likely he said 
i ask you to exercise selfdiscipline the clock is running 
very rapidly i ask you to use discretion and pull amendments you 
might have to bills use some restraint in asking to be excused 
from the floor 
consider your colleagues in these final few days he said 
he cautioned that the last few days could be long 
i ask for your consideration the session still has some 
possibilities barrett said 
attempting to lighten things up he added i do this in a 
spirit of christian love and all that were all concerned i had 
hoped i wouldnt have to give this speech this year 
on thursday after he raised the meat cleaver lawmakers decided 
to work through the lunch

irs employees are answering correctly 78 
percent of telephoned tax questions they address this year but 
barely onethird of calls are being answered at all government 
auditors said thursday 
the accuracy rate is up significantly from 66 percent last year 
the general accounting office told the house ways and means 
oversight subcommittee but at this time a year ago 61 percent of 
callers were getting through to the irs compared with 34 percent 
this year 
it makes me sick that taxpayer service has declined irs 
commissioner fred t goldberg jr told the subcommittee 
he blamed a budget squeeze and a sharply higher number of calls 
for the problem goldberg said service will deteriorate further and 
tax collections will suffer unless congress approves the full 61 
billion irs budget that president bush proposed for the 12 months 
that begin oct 1 
if they cut our budget 200 million its going to cost the 
federal government 550 million in 1991 goldberg said 
further overhaul of the irs 1960sera computers is essential 
he said and the 1991 budget will not make up for shortages of 
previous years 
i am afraid that the tax system will continue to pay the price 
of the 19891990 hiring freeze and failure to provide adequate 
training and support for our employees for years to come 
goldberg said 
goldberg and jennie s stathis taxpolicy director of gao an 
arm of congress agreed that the irs is having a generally 
successful returnfiling season despite a lack of money 
ms stathis cited these figures 
gao telephoned 20 tax questions to 29 irs offices and scored 
1261 responses 78 percent were correct 
through march 17 taxpayers had called the irs 315 million 
times and the irs had answered 107 million of the calls during a 
similar period last year the number of attempted calls was far 
less 193 million but 118 million were answered 
chances of getting through on the first try have dropped to 55 
percent from 69 percent last year 
processing of returns is 125 percent ahead of last years 
pace returns received are up 35 percent the number of refunds is 
up 167 percent 
the number of returns with taxpayer errors or irs processing 
mistakes is dropping from 16 percent last year to 14 percent this 
year the irs says taxpayers are responsible for about six of every 
10 errors 
irs forms and publications are more readily available this 
year a check of 13 walkin sites found 10 were missing five or 
fewer of 82 required items the worst case was one site missing 
eight items 
ordering forms and publications by phone can be as troublesome 
as telephoning a tax question but once a caller connects the irs 
is prompt in mailing requested items within the promised 14 days 
the agency is not as reliable for items ordered by letter 
members of the ways and means subcomittee were concerned that 
the percentage of taxpayers being audited continues to decline to 
only about 9 per 1000 returns this year 
congress may be forced to mandate a minimum audit level 
said rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the panel 
goldberg argued against any minimum level but said that with a 
larger budget the irs might be able to boost the current level to 
about 13 per 1000 by 1993 he noted that about 40 million 
individual returns whose incomes are solely from wages interest 
and dividends receive the equivalent of an audit every year 
through a computer matching program 
the commissioner said the irs computer system and a complex tax 
law are imposing an intolerable burden on the public 
the greatest challenge of the coming decade is to make the 
system more workable for the tens of millions of taxpayers who are 
willing to pay what they owe but cannot abide the complexity 
uncertainty and administrative hassles they face in complying with 
the law and in dealing with the irs goldberg said

wartime records concealed for decades show that 
soviet secret police not german invaders murdered thousands of 
polish officers in the katyn pine forest of western russia a 
newspaper reported 
the weekly moscow news used information from official records in 
a twopage article about the katyn forest massacre one of the 
grisliest chapters of the stalin era 
official soviet accounts have said it was the germans who mowed 
down the cream of the polish officer corps held prisoner just 
south of smolensk 
articles published previously have demanded the truth about 
katyn but none documented the soviet role in the deaths of 
thousands of poles 
katyn fostered a deep distrust of the soviets in poland even 
during the four decades it spent as a client state of the kremlin 
a polishsoviet commission investigated the massacre but did not 
issue a formal report 
moscow news concluded the polish officers were killed in the 
spring of 1940 well before the germans invaded the region not in 
1941 as the official version has claimed 
familiarity with the whole set of documents allows one to come 
to the conclusion that the polish officers and police were shot in 
april and may by units of the nkvd a precursor of the kgb it 
said the article was based on research by historian natalia 
lebedeva 
hitlers army invaded western poland on sept 1 1939 starting 
world war ii weeks later the red army marched into eastern poland 
and remained there until the germans pushed them out in 1941 
the newspaper indicated up to 15000 polish officers were killed 
when the nkvd evacuated three prison camps 
most estimates of the number of victims at katyn hover around 
4000 lebedevas reference apparently was to a general operation 
that included execution sites other than the forest 
soon i came to understand that this was not a coincidental 
action but a wellthoughtthrough and carefully planned 
operation said lebedeva who used central national archives and 
soviet army records in her research 
she said it appeared the camps were needed to hold thousands of 
people who would be deported from the three baltic states latvia 
lithuania and estonia after soviet troops moved into them 
the soviet union absorbed the baltic republics to the northwest 
of katyn in 1940 under a secret agreement with germany that 
divided eastern europe into soviet and german spheres of influence 
in the past year or two katyn forest has become a pilgrimage 
site for poles and a group calling itself families of katyn victims 
has thousands of members 
lists published in the moscow news implicate dozens of soviet 
secret police army and government officials in the massacre 
including stalin and lavrenti beria head of the nkvd 
stalin appeared to have held a special grudge against the polish 
officers the article said because his vanity was hurt by the 
polish defeat of soviet troops two decades earlier 
lebedeva said older archivists told her the nkvd tried to take 
over the katyn files in the 1940s but failed she acknowledged 
finding the name katyn only once in the files but said the routes 
to the points where mass graves have been found were laid out 
clearly 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki of poland has said the full 
story of the massacre must be told if there to be true friendship 
between poland and the soviet union 
a monument at the site of the mass grave in katyn gives the 
official soviete version of events honoring the victims of 
fascism polish officers shot by the nazis in 1941 
the germans found the mass graves in 1943 and immediately blamed 
the soviet union but the soviets said the nazis murdered the men 
in 1941 during the german march on moscow 
president mikhail s gorbachev and gen wojciech jaruzelski the 
polish leader established the commission of soviet and polish 
historians in 1987 last year the polish members said documents 
indicated there was no doubt the soviets were responsible for the 
katyn massacre

representatives of the three largest unions 
representing government employees criticized on thursday a bush 
administration proposal to link pay raises to job performance 
i believe that we have been performing since 1977 without any 
consequent pay said robert m tobias president of the 
140000member national treasury employees union after testifying 
before the senate governmental affairs committee 
the committee is considering legislation by committee chairman 
john glenn dohio aimed at closing the gap between lowerpaid 
government workers and their higherpaid counterparts in private 
industry a 1989 report by the government puts the gap at 29 
percent 
tobias was referring to a 1970 law that requires the 
administration to keep federal salaries in line with private pay a 
congressional research service report that was released at the 
glenn hearing said the process broke down in 1978 
tobias testified and the report said that presidents reagan 
and bush have consistently authorized amounts lower than 
recommended by the labor department office of management and 
budget and office of personnel management 
as a result i cant trust the administration to come up with a 
fair and just payforperformance situation given its past 
behavior tobias said in the interview 
bush said thursday that he has not formally approved the 
proposal to link raises to performance but he said the notion has 
his strong support 
the opm which handles personnel matters for the federal 
bureaucracy plans to ask for congressional authority to do away 
with the step salary system that awards a pay increase every 
year opm spokesman richard mcgowan said wednesday night 
james n sturdivant president of the 700000member american 
federation of government employees and james m peirce president 
of the 150000member national federation of federal employees 
both said the notion of payforperformance has been around for a 
long time 
we thought we were going to have some substantive proposals 
from the administration to reform federal pay said sturdivant in 
an interview after his testimony instead we basically get 
warmedover proposals that have nothing to do with the pay 
problems were dealing with 
elaborating on his committee testimony sturdivant said the 
administration cannot improve pay for federal employees without 
budgeting money for increases the administration he said has 
been taking pay out of agency budgets 
you cant reform the federal pay system without putting more 
money into it he said and basically what theyre saying is 
were going to reform it but were going to save money 
peirce said a merit pay system exists to reward performance 
all we need to do is follow what were supposed to be doing and 
well have it pure and simple he said 
the administration proposal would divide government employees 
into two classes one covering professional and administrative 
workers and the other including technicians and clerks mcgowan 
said 
technicians and clerks would get annual step increases until 
they reach the average local salary for their jobs after which 
they would have to win merit increases just like professional and 
administrative employees 
federal pay ranges from 10600 to 87000 a year and is 
generally uniform regardless of whether an employee lives in boston 
or cleveland on the east coast or in the midwest 
glenn has introduced legislation that would make government pay 
comparable to private pay index annual raises to an employment 
cost formula and assure that the budget earmarks money for pay

a pair of bald eagles is on a collision course 
with denvers new 23 billion airport and conservationists say 
the eagles and 330 other bird species that nest at barr lake state 
park could be in danger 
conservationists and wildlife officials want denver 
international airport to establish a bufferzone nature sanctuary 
to prevent houses offices and shops from sprouting up on its 
northwestern fringes near barr lake 
the airport which opens up in 1993 wont pay 
we dont feel we should said airport director bill smith 
we arent adding anything to the problems in the area and were 
not increasing any problems that exist 
wildlife experts are surprised that the birds chose to nest just 
18 miles from downtown denver and 3 miles northwest of the airport 
the eagles were the first on record to nest and to colonize on 
the rocky mountains eastern slopes in 1986 previously the 
eastern colorado front range served only as a resting stop for 
eagles migrating south from canada toward mexico new mexico and 
texas for the winter 
the birth of two eaglets last year drew numerous bird watchers 
the eaglets later flew off and wildlife officials are hopeful they 
will soon return to nest 
there are only 10 bald eagle nesting sites in the whole state 
and only one along the front range said mike carter director of 
the colorado bird observatory dont airport officials understand 
the principle of the straw that broke the camels back 
carter worried that the airport will destroy a unique 
opportunity for the endangered bald eagles to grab a foothold if it 
refuses to help out 
if the worst happens the construction of the airports fringe 
developments would at least enable observers to document the 
destruction of a bird refuge he said 
there have been very few studies with 80 to 90 years of 
records and this could be our first chance to document these 
changes carter said i dont see that as a benefit this could 
destroy 100 years worth of resources 
the airport already has concluded in a 35000 study that 
because of the airports noise regulations incoming planes wont 
pose a threat but construction near barr lake may drive the birds 
away carter said 
barr lake park is made up of 2000 acres of water and two narrow 
strips on land on each side that measure 700 acres wildlife 
records from the area have been kept since 1909 and 330 species 
are documented 
warning signs prohibit entry to the eagles nesting area and 
violators face a 20000 fine and a years imprisonment but 
outdoors enthusiasts can cross a narrow ridge and watch the birds 
through binoculars 
the denver audubon society and colorado department of natural 
resources wants the airport to put aside some of its discretionary 
funds for wildlife conservation to buy a 2000acre buffer zone 
around the lake or buy development rights to prevent construction 
there 
the lands cost has not been determined 
all the buffer zone will do is keep developers away from the 
lake said its chairwoman polly reetz in addition to the 
eagles we have a lot of animals that move in and out and raptors 
that hunt in fields adjacent to the park 
carter of the colorado bird observatory would prefer a 
wildlife sanctuary on the airport grounds a 2000footwide zone 
stretching from the airport to the nearby rocky mountain arsenal 
which already serves as a wildlife refuge 
denver planners are negotiating with the army which owns the 
arsenal to move fences and allow bike trails in the area to take 
advantage of arsenal wildlife which include antelope deer and 
coyotes 
the airport is being constructed to replace denvers stapleton 
international one of the nations busiest it will occupy 50 
square miles and its main terminal will be heavily landscaped with 
greenery to promote the image of an oasis on the plains indoor 
waterfalls and fountains also are planned 
carter said that without action development will occur around 
the lake because of plans to complete a beltway around denver but 
he thinks the state and conservation groups should share with the 
airport the cost of protecting the birds and other wildlife 
park spokeswoman carol leasure said farmers and landowners 
should not be penalized if airportfringe developments are deferred 
we want to see that theyre fairly compensated too she 
said

the united states is investigating the 
possibility that soviet ss23 mediumrange missiles banned by a 
1987 treaty may have been illegally transferred to czechoslovakia 
the state department said thursday 
the department earlier had disclosed it is looking into the 
possibility that ss23 missiles may also have been transfered to 
the east german armed forces 
spokesman richard boucher said the key question is whether the 
missiles if any were transfered before or after the signing of 
the intermediate nuclear forces or inf treaty in december 1987 
if the weapons were transferred before the treaty was signed by 
former president reagan and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
they are not covered by the pact boucher said 
if they were transferred after it was signed the transfer 
violates the treaty he said 
thats the point that were looking into boucher said i 
dont have a judgment on that thats the key point as to whether 
they are covered by the treaty or not whether they were transfered 
before or after and thats where we have to satisfy ourselves in 
order to make a judgment 
weve asked the czech government for further information on 
the possible presence of ss23 missiles in czechoslovakia 
boucher said as weve said before we regard this as a serious 
matter 
the treaty applies to us and soviet mediumrange missiles and 
specifically prohibits the transfers of such weapons after the 
treaty was signed 
he said the united states has raised the question of the 
possible illegal transfer and possession of banned mediumrange 
missiles not only with the soviet union czechoslovakia and east 
germany but with certain other nations as well he did not identify 
them 
asked if the soviets had ever pledged not to transfer missiles 
before the treaty was signed as a gesture of good faith boucher 
said the department is still analyzing records of the 
discussions 
although boucher said the united states is not prepared to 
disclose how many suspect missiles may be involved the washington 
times reported that the czech government told the united states two 
weeks ago that more than 70 ss23 missiles with a range of about 
310 miles are deployed within its territory and are being 
dismantled 
the inf treaty bans all us and soviet missiles with a range of 
between 300 and 3400 miles 
the possible presence of prohibited ss23 missiles in east 
germany and czechoslovakia has caused alarm among administration 
officials who fear the incidents could damage prospects for 
succesfully ratifying a treaty making sharp reductions in 
longrange intercontinental missiles

a drug that eases the hearts workload can 
cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in 
people recovering from heart attacks according to a major study 
released thursday 
the study conducted in denmark found that the drug verapamil 
known as a calcium channel blocker was effective for the 1 years 
after a heart attack calcium blockers are among several classes of 
medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure 
this is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker 
may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction or heart 
attack said dr carl j pepine of the university of florida 
several other studies of calcium blockers including one large 
us study published last year failed to find any benefit from 
using the medicines after heart attacks 
according to the danish study verapamil is about as effective 
as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta 
blockers at protecting people after heart attacks 
while calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart 
attacks the researchers said these drugs still should have a role 
in treatment 
we feel it is important to have alternatives many patients do 
not tolerate beta blockers said dr kresten mellemgaard of 
central county hospital in hillerod denmark a coauthor of the 
study 
beta blockers are generally not recommended for people with 
asthma and emphysema this means the drugs often cannot be given to 
cigarette smokers who are frequent victims of heart attacks 
in the study conducted at 20 community hospitals doctors 
compared 897 patients who got verapamil after heart attacks with 
878 people who took placebos 
after 18 months of followup there were 146 deaths or recurring 
heart attacks among the verapamil patients compared with 180 in 
people who got the dummy medication 
we wanted to see if an effect would be observed with 
verapamil said dr forgen fischer hansen of copenhagen municipal 
hospital 
if it had an effect it should be seen in the first 12 to 18 
months because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial 
infarction in this period he said then it levels off thats 
what we demonstrated it worked 
the researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work 
needed by the heart to sustain circulation calcium blockers 
lowered the chances of ischemia episodes in which the hearts own 
muscle is deprived of oxygen 
they said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show 
any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks however 
they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also taking 
beta blockers and this might have obscured any benefits from 
calcium blockers 
the results were presented at a meeting of the american college 
of cardiology among other research described at the meeting 
dr james h chesebro of the mayo clinic said a fiveyear study 
found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing 
blockages in the arteries feeding the heart although it may 
modestly protect against the development of new deposits however 
like other studies this one found that aspirin signficantly cut 
the risk of heart attacks 
dr eugene braunwald of harvard medical school said the next 
phase of a large study of clotdissolving drugs will see what 
effect they have in unstable angina this is a condition in which 
people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work 
or stress until now the drugs have been used only to treat heart 
attacks

president bush is counting on the soviet union 
to limit its borrowing from a development bank being proposed to 
finance a marshall plantype rebuilding of eastern europe 
administration officials said thursday 
the administration has said the united states will participate 
in the 12 billion european bank for reconstruction and development 
only if soviet borrowing is limited to what moscow contributes in 
capital and then only for loans to develop private enterprises 
under secretary of the treasury david mulford said the soviets 
are aware of us concerns after meetings between the top finance 
and banking officials of the two countries here last week 
he said the administration was eagerly awaiting counterproposals 
from moscow before an april 89 meeting in paris to put the final 
touches on chartering the 12 billion multinational development 
bank 
weve said that if the soviet position cannot be worked out 
we will not join the bank mulford told a senate foreign 
relations subcommittee our ability and willingness to make any 
further compromises would be extremely limited and perhaps 
nonexistent 
the administration already has made several concessions in 
establishing the bank when the idea was first proposed in january 
by french president francois mitterrand the united states wanted a 
5 billion bank devoted solely to lending for private enterprise in 
eastern europe with the soviet union excluded from participation 
in six negotiating sessions since then administration officials 
have bowed to allowing the proposed bank to lend 40 percent of its 
funds for government infrastructure improvements such as roads 
the administration also has softened its demand that the 
borrowing countries must turn staterun enterprises such as 
utilities into private businesses to qualify for loans financing 
their improvement 
house democrats have criticized bushs insistence on a 
diminished soviet role in the bank as a continuation of cold war 
politics that will only decrease us ability to shape events in 
the region and freeze american companies out of the newly freed 
markets 
in the senate democrats have muted their criticism while 
including 12 billion as the united states 10 percent share of 
the new bank as part of legislation to provide 2 billion in new 
aid to seven east european countries 
there are going to be big problems up here on the soviet 
issue sen patrick leahy dvt and chairman of the senate 
appropriations foreign operations subcommittee told treasury 
secretary nicholas brady on thursday frankly its going to 
happen whether we join or not and we need to be in on it if we are 
going to influence how things go over there 
while both brady and mulford expressed optimism that an accord 
can be reached for us participation in the european bank new 
challenges to it surfaced thursday from the presidents own party 
sen robert kasten rwis said he and senate republican leader 
bob dole of kansas would introduce a bill to instead establish a 
new facility in the world bank devoted to lending for private 
enterprise in eastern europe 
the us should boycott the eastern european bank altogether 
if the banks charter allows any soviet borrowing kasten said 
this bank will be dominated by european policy makers who 
still believe that socialism can be reformed and that 
government action raises living standards 
brady expressed skepticism at kastens plan saying the united 
states would have less leverage both politically and economically 
under such a scheme he also acknowledged that a bank without a 
us role could become a public relations fiasco for the 
administration 
could you imagine what the headlines would read all over the 
world if the united states pulls out of the bank brady asked at 
one point

dr jonathan mann said in an interview published 
thursday that he quit as director of the world health 
organizations aids program because his superiors attitude slowed 
or blocked work intended to combat the disease 
the lack of commitment of the directorgeneral in putting into 
action the world program in the fight against aids became a 
fundamental question for me mann was quoted as saying by the 
newspaper le monde he said he was constantly confronted by an 
administrative wall in trying to carry out programs 
on wednesday who named dr michael h merson another american 
as manns replacement 
mann headed whos program on acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
since 1986 in his march 16 letter of resignation to whos 
directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima mann cited a great 
variance between our positions on a series of issues but he did 
not elaborate 
the outgoing director was quoted by le monde as saying the 
61yearold nakajimas attitude completely paralyzed our 
efforts 
today it is practically impossible to translate words into 
concrete action mann contended in the interview 
the action of the directorgeneral is not at the level of the 
principles established by who mann was quoted as saying 
mann 42 said he believed who should play a leadership role on 
the issue of access by all aids patients not just those with the 
economic means to medication he noted that in brazzaville 
congo a global commission on aids adopted such a program in may 
since then nothing so many times i begged the 
directorgeneral i use the word by design so that he would take 
action toward this end no no no reaction great principles are 
good but one must know how to put them into action mann said 
responding to suggestions that competition between the two men 
may have been at the center of the conflict he told le monde 
perhaps that is the case all i know is there are other ways 
to avoid hampering the action of a global program for two years 
when mann joined who nearly four years ago its aids program 
consisted of him and a secretary with funds coming from the 
regular who budget the program now has a staff of close to 200 
people and a special budget that has tripled in the past three 
years to 109 million he traveled widely to push a worldwide 
campaign to inform people of the dangers of aids and the methods of 
protection 
since the resignation was announced mann and nakajima have 
declined requests for interviews with the associated press 
in a statement last week nakajima said he regretted manns 
resignation he said it happened without previous consultation at 
a time when the organization is confronted with new challenges 
concerning the fight against aids

high homicide rates aids and lack of medical 
care are continuing to cut short the lives of black americans 
while the health of whites is improving a government report said 
thursday 
while whites can expect to live to the age of 755 life 
expectancy for blacks is 695 and for black males it is 651 
according to the study 
this concerns us greatly said health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan 
we need to move toward equal health opportunity for our 
citizens including the good health information and the family and 
community support that will help every american make the right 
choices for health and productive lives he said 
healthier living quitting smoking using seat belts reducing 
violence and eating more nutritiously is the key to improving 
health since more than half the causes of premature death are 
related to lifestyle he said 
we have the data to show this pays off this will have more 
effect than any of our medical research he said 
however he added that while lifestyle changes are easily 
articulated as a goal what we dont have enough information on 
yet is how do we most effectively get the information across and 
have people act on it 
the study health united states 1989 is the 14th annual report 
of the health status of the nation 
overall the country improved its infant mortality rate slightly 
to 99 deaths per 1000 live births in 1988 although this rate 
still ranks the united states behind 21 other nations and the gap 
between whites and blacks is widening 
white infants died at the rate of 86 per 1000 live births in 
1987 down 03 points from 1986 during the same period the rate 
for black babies dropped only slightly and at 179 per 1000 births 
is more than twice as high as for whites 
dramatic declines in deaths from heart disease down 33 percent 
between 1970 and 1987 and stroke which was cut in half during the 
period contributed to the increased longevity of americans 
but the gains werent shared equally the decline was greatest 
among white men 35 percent followed by 31 percent for white 
women 28 percent for black women and 24 percent for black men and 
in 1987 the death rate for stroke was twice as high among blacks 
as whites 
health experts say the gaps are not always explained with 
behaviors such as smoking diet homicide and other lifestyle 
factors 
indeed studies show that regardless of the age education or 
marital status of the mother and whether she had early prenatal 
care black woman are generally twice as likely to have a low 
birthweight baby a key factor in infant mortality sullivan said 
also some of the disparity in deaths from stroke cannot be 
explained by lifestyle he said 
the decline in cigarette smoking is accelerating sullivan said 
from 1985 to 1988 cigarette sales dropped about 2 percent a year 
but decreased 6 percent from 1988 to 1989 
however from 1970 to 1987 lung cancer the leading cause of 
death among women increased by 31 percent for white women and 25 
percent for black women 
in 1987 homicide took the lives of seven times more black males 
than white males while the homicide rate for black females was 
more than four times that for white females 
blacks were also lagging in the proportion of mothers receiving 
prenatal care in the first three months of pregnancy for blacks 
the proportion was 61 percent in 1987 compared with 60 percent for 
american indians 76 percent of asian and pacific islanders and 79 
percent for white women 
a growing number of blacks are being diagnosed with acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome increasing from 25 percent to 29 
percent of all aids cases between 1984 and 1988 as of last 
september blacks made up 55 percent of all aids cases among 
children under age 13 and hispanics accounted for 21 percent

president bush acknowledging congressional 
resistance to freeing 800 million for his panama and nicaragua aid 
program urged lawmakers thursday to let him make the pentagon cuts 
needed to provide the money 
he said several members of congress have told him it would be 
difficult to get congress to pass the aid package in the face of 
other budgetary priorities 
but i am going to continue to reiterate the importance not 
just to the united states but to the whole hemisphere of the aid 
package that i have requested bush said 
his request includes 300 million in economic assistance for 
nicaragua long suffering under a us trade embargothat includes 
30 million to help resettle the usbacked contra rebels who 
fought for a decade against the leftist government just voted out 
of office 
the other 500 million would go to help panama recover from the 
us military invasion in december and the economic sanctions 
imposed by the united states against the regime of manuel antonio 
noriega 
bush decried sentiments that aid to panama and nicaragua should 
take a back seat to helping the emerging democracies of eastern 
europe 
there are those that argue that panama and nicaragua are not 
as vital as eastern europe theyre wrong he told a news 
conference this is our hemisphere and we have a strong aid 
program for eastern europe and will continue to do so and we can 
do no less for our own neighbors 
however sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee on foreign aid has said that congress 
should look at the presidents request in terms of a choice between 
two small countries on the one hand or all of eastern europe on 
the other 
bush said one senator told him it would be a very difficult 
sell 
i dont understand it the president added because i 
think the united states has a disproportionate role in the 
evolution of democracy in panama and nicargua 
weve got a lot at stake in both countries 
bush sent congress the aid request last week saying that the 
money should be taken from the defense department budget 
he directed his office of management and budget and 
representatives of the defense department to negotiate with the 
defense appropriations subcommittees of the house and senate on 
where the cuts should be made 
so far no resolution has been reached 
if we are unable to to resolve our differences regarding 
offsets then i would be happy to have congress authorize me to 
select the offsets from the defense budget in order to get economic 
assistance moving in the region bush said 
meanwhile at the state department deputy spokesman richard 
boucher criticized the sandinista government for refusing to allow 
contra leaders to fly to managua for discussions on demobilization 
and repatriation 
we find this refusal inconsistent with the sandinistas own 
professed desire for national reconciliation and for a successful 
demobilization process he said 
boucher said the rebel leaders want to arrange talks with church 
leaders and with aides to presidentelect violeta chamorro but that 
the sandinista interior ministry has not given them permission to 
enter nicaragua 
thousands of contra rebels remain at camps in honduras near the 
nicaraguan border

the small white madonna is still nestled 
outside the brownshingled duplex where carol dimaiti stuart grew 
up and where her parents and aunt still live but six months after 
her slaying no one answers the door 
the same is true a few miles away on lowe street in revere 
where the parents of charles stuart have maintained a silence about 
the horrifying crime that riveted the nation 
boston police citing an ongoing grand jury investigation have 
remained almost as closemouthed as the families 
the case that took a shocking twist jan 4 when charles stuart 
apparently jumped to his death from the tobin bridge remains a 
mystery 
there are a hell of a lot more holes in this story than solid 
information said ken englade an albuquerque nmbased writer 
whose paperback murder in boston is due in bookstores at the 
end of the month it doesnt help that nobody is talking 
englade said he was frustrated by the refusal of boston police 
and suffolk county district attorney newman flanagan to disclose 
information about the case they also have withheld medical reports 
more baffling is the prosecutors refusal to release tapes of 
the lineup where charles stuart allegedly identified william 
bennett as his assailant 
and even though life insurance money was thought to be stuarts 
motive only 280000 in life insurance money was apparently taken 
out on his wifes life the two 100000 policies purchased by 
stuart were barely enough to cover the mortgage on their house 
englade said carol stuart was insured for 80000 through her work 
based on his research englade said he is not convinced stuart 
actually killed his wife or even if he jumped off the bridge 
voluntarily he cited numerous contradictions in the case even in 
the hours before stuarts apparent suicide when he left 
instructions with a hotel clerk to rouse him at 430 am 
who leaves a wakeup call to commit suicide englade 
asserted 
the only person associated with the tragedy who is willing to 
talk is carols 37yearold brother carl dimaiti a former high 
school teacher who has taken over the familys pizza dough 
business he heads the scholarship foundation established in 
carols name for residents in bostons mission hill district where 
she was shot so far the foundation has received more than 
340000 
this week found him in a familiar setting accepting a donation 
for the foundation at an inner city outreach center he is usually 
accompanied by two public relations agent who monitor his remarks 
dimaiti said thursday his familys ordeal has been eased 
considerably by their work with the foundation 
im amazed that people have gone out of their way and 
responded like this he said it shows the deep well of 
goodness in people its been a very difficult time for us this 
has especially helped my mother and father through a very tough 
time 
their ordeal began the night of oct 23 when boston police 
received a frantic call over a car phone from stuart he said he 
and his wife had been shot by a black gunman who robbed them 
shortly after they left a childbirth class at a hospital in mission 
hill 
carol stuart a 30yearold tax attorney who was seven months 
pregnant was shot in the head she died a few hours later after 
her son christopher was prematurely delivered the baby died 17 
days later 
stuart 30yearold manager of a fur store was shot in the 
stomach and remained hospitalized until december his body was 
recovered from the waters of boston harbor the day after his 
younger brother matthew told police he had been enlisted by 
charles to aid in the crime 
since then a grand jury has met seven times to hear testimony 
in the case according to dave rodman spokesman for the district 
attorneys office stuarts siblings and his mother have appeared 
before the grand jury sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said several witnesses are still scheduled to testify 
the families have picked up the pieces of their lives in various 
ways carols mother evelyn dimaiti 58 has returned to her job 
in a state office mrs dimaitis husband giusto 64 is retired 
but can often be found at the family bakery in nearby chelsea 
charles stuart sr who suffers from parkinsons disease and 
his wife dorothy remain in seclusion at the home they share with 
sons matthew and mark matthew reportedly still holds his job as a 
mixer at a paint factory and is a familiar figure on the streets of 
revere in his stonewashed jeans and leather jacket 
in addition to the soontobe published paperback at least two 
hardback books and a cbs television movie are planned 
paul corkery a freelance writer and former editor of boston 
magazine has rented an apartment in revere to work on his book for 
simon and schuster he said he has 50000 words of notes culled 
mostly from interviews with friends and relatives outside the two 
families 
its not a typical whodunit said corkery its the story 
of a hero who turned out to be the villain

president bush on thursday denied that a 
remark by him had affected events in israel where the government 
of prime minister yitzhak shamir fell last week 
i do not think it contributed to the fall of the government 
these are highly complex internal matters in the state of 
israel bush told a news conference on the white house lawn 
his comment march 3 about jewish settlements in east jerusalem 
touched off a firestorm of controversy because us officials have 
previously shied away from including east jerusalem when 
complaining about jewish settlements in the west bank area 
bush however told reporters that the foreign policy of the 
united states says we do not believe there should be new 
settlements in the west bank or in east jerusalem 
he was asked thursday if that statement had contributed to 
destabilizing the shamir government or the overall peace process 
i dont believe it made a contribution because i think if you 
look at the issues both the domestic economy and the question of 
the peace talks that those were the key issues in the campaign 
because most people in israel understood that i was simply 
reiterating a standing united states policy one that i feel very 
strongly about bush said 
most anaylsts believe his remark about east jerusalem disrupted 
progress in the fragile talks on middle east peace 
a key issue in trying to get israel to the table with the 
palestinians has been who can represent the palestinians and 
whether some should be from east jerusalem and the occupied west 
bank 
prospects for the talks are up in the air because political 
crisis in israel following shamirs fall in the parliamentary 
noconfidence motion last week 
shimon peres head of the leftleaning labor party is trying to 
form a new government

when it comes to energy education most 
students know only how to save it a poll showed thursday 
the national energy education development project said a poll of 
25000 american students in 32 states found most characterized 
themselves as energy savers 
yet the results showed most of the students have great 
difficulty understanding and identifying such basic concepts about 
energy and the environment as estimated costs efficiency factors 
predominant uses and properties of the nations various fuel 
sources 
students should know and care as much about the debate over 
clean air as they do air jordans said gerard katz director of 
the need project the assessment will provide a starting point so 
we can better educate young people to make informed decisions about 
the many complex energy issues facing our society 
the poll described as the only census of its kind was 
released by the national assessment committee of the need project 
to mark the 10th anniversary since congress and the white house 
launched the project as a means to boost energy awareness among 
consumers 
the 11question survey involved 12326 middle grade students and 
11921 high school students as well as about 2000 educators from 
15 states students consistently scored about 10 hazelwoods devins 
said the spill 
showed that industry does not have the technology to deal with oil 
spills of that magnitude and that prevention must be stressed he 
said 
the bad judgment and behavior of joe hazelwood in the initial 
accident was eclipsed by the inept behavior arrogance and bad 
judgment of exxon in their cleanup effort said ann rothe alaska 
regional representative for the national wildlife federation 
it is exxon that was to blame for the spill not the captain 
she said 
they let a man who couldnt get a drivers license to drive an 
automobile captain one of their tankers thats just negligence

democratic party officials searching for a 
winning strategy in the shadow of president bushs formidable 
approval ratings are ready to endorse a cut in the social security 
payroll tax 
a resolution to put the party on record in support of a proposal 
on that subject by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny is on the 
agenda friday for the democratic national committee meeting in 
indianapolis 
the resolution pushed by gov mario cuomo of new york is part 
of a broad effort to persuade voters around the country that the 
democrats are the party that represents the middle class 
but as usual the party is far from united the democratic 
leadership council dominated by elected officials is gathering 
half a continent away in new orleans with its own avowed purpose of 
setting the partys agenda for the 1990s and beyond 
before leaving for new orleans congressional democrats released 
what they called the new orleans declaration the statement of 
principles was aimed at moving the party from the left toward the 
mainstream of america said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
dlc 
it also calls for a reduction in the social security payroll 
tax but without specifically naming moynihans proposal 
it also refers to another touchy issue abortion without 
mentioning it by name we believe government should respect 
individual liberty and stay out of our private lives and personal 
decisions 
nunn said that was not a definitive statement on abortion but 
certainly points in the direction of people making their own choice 
on that 
last year the party won several important races including 
governor of virginia in campaigns emphasizing much clearer stands 
in support of abortion rights 
striving to present a united democratic front party chairman 
ronald brown issued a statement from indianapolis praising the 
declaration put out by those headed for new orleans 
the ideas and principles in this document put democrats 
squarely on the side of working people brown said on their 
behalf democrats are leading this nations most important debate 
shaping and designing americas future 
officials of the dnc and the dlc insisted the scheduling 
conflict that saw both groups meeting on identical days was an 
accident but the conflicting sessions reflected the internal 
struggle for the future of the democratic party 
the democratic leadership council was formed by elected 
officials largely from the south and west after ronald reagans 
49state landslide reelection in 1984 the groups founders wanted 
a counterweight to what they saw as the leftward drift of the 
national party 
the two meetings were certain to generate a lot of rhetoric but 
whether any voters would hear it or care was another matter 
too often democrats miss the mark by talking in the language 
of the district of columbia that is abstract and inside and doesnt 
affect people either intellectually or touch them personally 
said sen barbara mikulski dmd 
not only were the democrats having trouble settling on a program 
that would attract voters they also were at odds over whether they 
had anything to worry about 
weve got real problems said former party chairman john c 
white 
but robert beckel a democratic political consultant said 
its amazing theres this much handwringing going on when i think 
things are trending considerably in the democrats direction 
in the meantime democrats are hardly showing enthusiasm for the 
partys 1992 presidential nomination at this stage in recent 
presidential campaigns the democratic field was already well 
established and crowded 
beckel said of bush they say hes 80 percent in the polls if 
you dont take him on hes gong to stay 80 percent in the polls 
pollster peter hart said democrats who were making their 1992 
plans based on bushs 1990 poll ratings are making a dreadful 
mistake its all going to change 
the democrats search for a message is typical of the agony of a 
party out of power in the white house where the president can set 
the national agenda 
theyre having a very tough time because they dont have a 
wellknown figure said charles black a republican consultant 
while the two groups hold their rival debates the 
democraticcontrolled congress has to deal directly with the 
president and his administration looking to put its stamp on 
current issues 
moynihans proposal was greeted with a flurry of criticism from 
the white house and many democrats decided it was best to keep 
their distance 
but the dnc has its eye on the voters and in moynihans plan 
those democrats sniff an issue that just might catch hold

president bush implored the soviet union 
thursday not to use force to block lithuanias secession but also 
urged the breakaway republic to recognize certain realities of 
moscows control 
commending the kremlin for dealing peacefully with changes in 
eastern europe bush said please continue to exercise that kind 
of restraint and remember no use of force he said both sides 
should negotiate their differences 
separately defense secretary dick cheney said any resort to 
military might would do great violence to the reforms being 
championed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the presidents comments came as soviet armored personnel 
carriers and trucks drove through the lithuanian capital in a show 
of force bush declined to criticize gorbachev for demanding that 
lithuanians surrender their guns they should talk about that 
bush said 
bush also refused to say how he would react if force were used 
what possible good would come from the president of the united 
states standing halfway around the world speculating on something 
that he doesnt want to see happen 
he issued his plea for restraint during a 20minute news 
conference on the white house lawn 
bush stood beneath a towering oak tree and next to a flowering 
eastern redbud tree that he and his wife barbara had just planted 
commenting on two days of talks with visiting polish prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki bush said there was no need for soviet 
troops to be stationed in poland or anywhere else in eastern 
europe and the sooner they get out of there the better he 
said 
bush acknowledged a nuance of difference with mazowiecki 
over the prime ministers demands that the two germanys sign a 
treaty guaranteeing polish borders before they unite but he said 
the poles and germans are very very close now to an 
understanding that the current borders must remain intact 
on another sensitive foreign policy issue bush disputed 
contentions that he contributed to the fall of the government of 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir with comments linking israeli 
settlements in east jerusalem with those in the west bank and gaza 
most people in israel understood that i was simply reiterating 
a standing united states policy one that i feel very strong 
about 
on other issues bush 
said he wants a treaty to cut soviet and american troops in 
europe to be ready by the time of his summit this summer with 
gorbachev in washington another oficial said bush had meant to say 
he wanted to have a strategicarms treaty ready by the summit bush 
said the summit date had not been set but should be pinned down 
soon 
said he will not attend the april 25 inauguration of 
usbacked presidentelect violeta chamorro in nicaragua but wants 
to visit the country sometime 
responding to another question bush said im dying to go to 
australia and wants to make the trip before the end of the year he 
declined to say he would go to new zealand during such a trip 
noting us unhappiness over its refusal to permit american 
warships carrying nuclear weapons in its waters 
refused to discuss texas republican gubernatorial candidate 
clayton williams concerns about running against a woman calling 
himself an expert on the subject because of his race against 
democrat geraldine ferraro in 1984 bush said i know exactly 
what he means and i refuse to elaborate on it for fear of 
complicating his life 
prodded congress to speed approval of 800 million in aid for 
panama and nicaragua 
in recent days the united states has expressed concern about 
soviet moves in lithuania which declared independence from moscow 
on march 11 after the ruling communists were removed from power in 
free elections however the united states has not extended formal 
diplomatic recognition saying lithuania does not control its 
territory 
in his remarks bush noted that the united states had never 
recognized the forced incorporation of lithuania or the other 
baltic states of estonia and latvia into the soviet union in 1940 
however there are certain realities in life bush said 
the lithuanians are well aware of them and they should talk as 
they are with the soviet officials about these differences 
he said he was pleased that soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze had said moscow would not use force 
it is very important that force not be used bush said 
but i believe that they can talk and work out these problems 
asked if he thought gorbachev was guilty of intimidation by 
demanding that lithuanians surrender their arms bush said i 
would prefer to put emphasis on his statement that there will be no 
use of force and thats where im going to keep the emphasis and 
keep reminding every party to this discussion over there no use 
of force 
meanwhile state department spokesman richard boucher said that 
moscows order to tighten visa controls in lithuania and expel 
foreigners contradicts the soviets commitment to a more open 
society and to contact between countries 
were concerned by the order to have internal security and 
secret police troops seize private sporting guns unless they are 
surrendered he said adding that the soviets are trying to 
suggest there is a threat to public order from lithuanians 
we believe however that the lithuanians are committed to a 
peaceful resolution of their differences with the soviet union the 
lithuanian people have shown their commitment to nonviolence and 
democracy boucher said

he is not as notorious as captain bligh 
or captain ahab but captain joseph hazelwood former skipper of 
the exxon valdez has sailed unwillingly into americas lore of the 
sea 
while cartoonists sketched him as a liquorswigging villain and 
tv comics parodied the infamous grounding of his ship the 
passionately private hazelwood returned to alaska this winter a 
year after the nations worst oil spill determined to clear his 
name 
id like to get rid of the misconception that i got drunk ran 
the ship aground and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away 
because thats just not what happened he said after the 
grounding of the exxon valdez had tarred his reputation along with 
hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
on thursday a jury found hazelwood innocent of the most serious 
charges against him convicting him only of a misdemeanor charge of 
negligent discharge of oil he faces up to 90 days in jail and a 
1000 fine 
he was acquitted of charges of seconddegree criminal mischief 
reckless endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny was the only person charged 
criminally in the environmental calamity he was accused of being 
drunk on duty and being away from the ships bridge when it rammed 
a charted reef 
he came back to alaska with some trepidation and kept a low 
profile outside court many nights he stayed in his hotel room 
watching old movies about sea captains rather than risk being 
recognized in public 
in court the balding bearded hazelwood sat mute watching in 
stoic silence as his crew members told their stories 
his demeanor was not unusual joe hazelwood had always been a 
man of few words 
his actions always spoke louder than his words because his 
words were not that many said attorney michael chalos 
hazelwoods former maritime college classmate who put together his 
defense team just days after the exxon valdez grounding made 
headlines 
in school says chalos the low key hazelwood was a natural 
leader very quiet but very determined 
he was captain of the lacrosse team and did well academically 
chalos recalls but was something of a rebel when it came to 
military authority his rebelliousness later would bring him into 
conflict with exxon executives over company policies 
when he graduated from new york state university maritime 
college at fort schyler hazelwood signed on with exxon shipping 
corp 
it was a plum appointment recalls chalos if you got a 
job with exxon youd made it 
he rose in the seagoing ranks obtained his masters license 
won the fleet award for efficiency in 1986 and in 1987 was given 
command of the brand new exxon valdez the most advanced hightech 
vessel in the exxon fleet 
he rarely spent more than three or four months at a time ashore 
but between voyages he returned to huntington where he and his 
wife suzanne live with their teenage daughter alison 
i get stark crazy when i am too far from the salt water he 
has said 
if there was a fatal flaw in hazelwoods smooth history of 
achievements it was his drinking he lost his new york motor 
vehicle drivers license after two drunken driving convictions and 
in 1985 with exxons knowledge he went through a 28day voluntary 
alcohol rehabilitation program 
was he drunk aboard the exxon valdez on the fateful night his 
crew members testified they saw no signs of intoxication although 
they had seen the captain put away a few drinks in town 
his blood alcohol reading was 061 in a test taken 10 hours 
after the grounding evidence was inconclusive on what his blood 
alcohol was earlier 
hazelwood true to his taciturn nature chose not to testify and 
never commented on the intoxication issue 
why didnt he testify attorneys said they were confident about 
their case and did not want to subject hazelwood to unnecessary 
grueling crossexamination they had another reason too 
sitting here at the defense table hes still the captain 
someone special said chalos if he had gotten up on the 
witness stand he wouldnt be special anymore hed be just another 
witness

exxon valdez captain joseph hazelwood 
was acquitted today of three major charges and convicted of one 
misdemeanor in the nations worst oil spill 
the single charge of which hazelwood was convicted negligent 
discharge of oil carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail 
and a 1000 fine far less than the 7 years and 61000 fine he 
could have faced 
there were bursts of applause in the court room as superior 
court judge karl johnstone read the first three verdicts of not 
guilty 
hazelwoods lawyers patted him on the back and for the first 
time in the long trial the normally solemn defendant smiled 
broadly 
the jurors delivering their verdict two days before the first 
anniversary of the disaster absolved hazelwood of all charges 
alleging that he was drunk and reckless when the tanker ran 
aground spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil into prince 
william sound 
the jurors reached their verdict after only 10 hours of 
deliberations 
earlier the jury signaled they were close to a unanimous 
decision by deciding to skip going out to lunch they ordered food 
sent into the jury room so they could continue their talks through 
the lunch hour 
but at noon johnstone emerged from his chambers and told 
reporters the panel has reached its verdict 
the panel which ended its first day of deliberations wednesday 
without reaching a verdict sought a series of blood alcohol charts 
and graphs used by a defense expert to illustrate his testimony 
johnstone after conferring in a hurried session with attorneys 
sent the jury a note saying you have received all of the 
evidence the exhibits you have requested are not in evidence 
the jurors returned to their task today checking in promptly at 
830 am a bailiff escorted them to their jury room and they began 
their talks for a second day the trial is in its seventh week 
meanwhile an alternate juror who was dismissed once the regular 
jury began its deliberations told the alaska public radio network 
she would have acquitted hazelwood of all charges 
terry turner an anchorage bookkeeper said she doubts the 
skipper was drunk while in command 
there were 21 witnesses who said there was no sign of 
impairment she said 
she added that she believed hazelwood had expected a normal 
transit of prince william sound on the night of the march 24 
grounding which might explain his decision to leave the ships 
bridge 
asked whether she believed hazelwood was drunk she said no 
i dont think he was there was a lot more to it than that we 
had a drunk captain running into a reef they really didnt have 
evidence of it 
ms turner said she felt hazelwoods loss of his job and the 
impact on his life was sufficient punishment for whatever role he 
had in the disaster 
i dont think he was totally to blame she said i hope a 
lot of the other jurors feel that way 
saturday will be the first anniversary of the disaster in which 
the 987foot tanker rammed the charted reef in prince william 
sount gushing nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil 
the spill wreaked devastation on birds fish and wildlife and 
coated hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline 
the exhibits sought by the jury wednesday were used by defense 
lawyers during the trial to help illustrate testimony by michael 
hlastala a physiologist who discussed blood testing for alcohol 
they showed the various absorption and burnoff rates of alcohol in 
the human body 
defense attorney dick madson said the charts were not placed in 
evidence because jurors might have been unable to decipher them 
without the accompanying testimony 
hlastala of the university of washington in seattle had branded 
as nonsense prosecution efforts to figure out hazelwoods blood 
alcohol level based on a blood test taken 10 hours after the march 
24 grounding 
the prosecution sought to prove that the fired exxon skipper was 
drunk when his ship went aground at bligh reef while hazelwood was 
below 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
seconddegree criminal mischief and three misdemeanors reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil he could receive 7 years in prison and 61000 
in fines if convicted 
the jurys note disclosed that they chose an insurance broker to 
serve as forewoman in deliberations the jury includes homemakers 
a real estate agent an accountant a postman and an air traffic 
controller 
johnstone said he would allow the jurors to continue their talks 
over the weekend if they should fail to reach verdicts by friday

the house banking committee on thursday 
approved plans designed to crack down on banks that allow 
themselves to be used in the moneylaundering operations of drug 
pushers 
money is the vehicle that drives the drug trade chairman 
henry b gonzalez dtexas said as the committee approved the bill 
480 
the measure would require federal regulators to hold a hearing 
on whether to close any bank convicted with its directors and 
officers of money laundering or related offenses the charter could 
be revoked or regulators could appoint a conservator to operate the 
bank 
federal officials already have the power to close banks 
convicted of money laundering however the hearings outlined in 
the bill would set the machinery in motion sponsors said 
lawmakers have expressed heightened concern about money 
laundering under which huge drug profits are hidden by 
transferring them through caribbean tax havens and other centers of 
banking secrecy before they are returned to the united states and 
invested in legitimate businesses 
a similar bill was introduced in the senate on wednesday 
banks that knowingly handle dirty drug money should not be 
permitted to do business in this country said sen john kerry 
dmass 
gonzalez described the house plan as a compromise that would not 
only punish those who ignore money laundering but also provide due 
process for bankers 
he hailed reps frank annunzio dill thomas r carper 
rdel and bill mccollum rfla for working out a compromise 
annunzio cited estimates that worldwide drug profits could total 
300 billion a year 
the vast quantities of cash may provide drug dealers with 
their greatest vulnerability to detection he said the drug 
dealer is caught in a neverending blizzard of cash every day 
the bill calls for removal of bank officials convicted of money 
laundering or structuring transactions to evade requirements of the 
bank secrecy act those convicted would be prohibited from 
affiliating with other financial institutions 
the measure would require the treasury department to establish 
regulations aimed at halting money laundering by wire transfer it 
would raise the fine for negligent noncompliance with 
moneylaundering reporting requirements from 500 to 5000

after a year of accusations against faceless villains exxon 
and oilrelated agencies the hazelwood trial provided a human 
side to the exxon valdez calamity focusing on frailties of captain 
and crew 
although 150 civil suits were filed and exxon was indicted in 
federal court hazelwood was the only individual charged 
criminally his lawyers complained he was a scapegoat in a 
disaster with many culprits 
his trial in anchorage superior court had the elements of an 
engrossing sea story with a dark subplot involving liquor troubled 
crew members and a starcrossed captain whose battles with the 
bottle were well known 
but the skipper who had been painted as a liquor swigging 
brigand turned out to be a quiet figure intent on nothing more 
than blending into the woodwork he sat back stroking his beard 
while others addressed the trials key questions was the skipper 
drunk on duty and was he reckless to leave the ships bridge 
whether hazelwood was drunk when his ship grounded remained a 
muddled issue because authorities failed to do a timely blood 
alcohol test when they got around to it 10 hours after the 
grounding hazelwood had a 061 alcohol reading lower than the 
alaska standard of 10 for drunken driving 
a prosecution expert witness tried to calculate backward and 
concluded that hazelwood had a blood alcohol reading of 14 when 
the ship grounded but defense experts ridiculed the figures as 
nonsense saying results could not be conclusive because there 
was too long a wait before the test and too many variables 
including whether hazelwood drank after the grounding 
hazelwood who chose not to testify never explained 
in six weeks of testimony witnesses came forward to tell what 
they knew of the day the exxon valdez and hazelwood sailed into 
history 
it was the thursday before good friday and the tanker had 
pulled into its namesake port of valdez to pick up a load of oil 
hazelwood went ashore for lunch with two crew members and a local 
pilot they remember that he sipped iced tea then they separated 
to do shopping 
later in the day the hour remained in dispute hazelwood met 
with his pals at the pipeline club a bar where they said he drank 
three vodkas in about three hours a woman patron of the club wife 
of a coast guard investigator in the case placed hazelwood there 
much earlier drinking for seven hours but her testimony never was 
corroborated 
on the way back to the ship the men stopped and bought pizza 
for the crew and hazelwood had another drink either beer or vodka 
when they arrived at the valdez terminal about 820 pm they 
learned that the sailing time originally set for 10 pm had been 
moved up to 9 pm the prosecution would maintain that hazelwoods 
tardiness in boarding his ship showed recklessness 
was the skipper intoxicated he showed no signs of it during 
the trial not a single witness said he appeared drunk 
did he stagger defense attorneys would ask did he slur 
his words inevitably the answers were no 
pilot william murphy who guided the tanker through the valdez 
narrows said he noticed a trace of alcohol on hazelwoods breath 
after a halfhour on the bridge he said the skipper went below and 
remained there for an hour when murphy left the ship at about 
1030 pm he conferred with hazelwood i reminded him there was 
ice reported ahead 
the crucial period recounted repeatedly in testimony began at 
1153 pm when hazelwood decided to leave the bridge in control of 
third mate gregory cousins after discussing maneuvers that would 
take the exxon valdez out of shipping lanes to avoid ice then turn 
back to the lanes before leaving prince william sound 
he asked if i felt comfortable with what we were going to do 
and i said yes recalled cousins he said do you feel 
comfortable enough that i can go below and get rid of some 
paperwork i said i felt very comfortable 
the prosecution would note that cousins did not have the special 
endorsement hazelwood had for piloting in prince william sound a 
license the defense claimed was mere formality and had been waived 
by the coast guard 
at the helm was robert kagan a seaman who had problems with 
steering in the past many witnesses would blame kagan for ramming 
the oilfilled tanker into a charted reef 
cousins said he ordered kagan to make a 10degree right rudder 
turn a routine order but he failed to check until it was too late 
to see if the turn had been made by then the exxon valdez was 
steaming toward bligh reef 
ten minutes after hazelwood left the bridge cousins glanced at 
the rudder indicator and i could tell we hadnt turned i 
think mr kagan didnt really understand the command 
cousins called hazelwood in his cabin 
i told him that we were getting into serious trouble 
the third mate recalled that was then we suffered the first 
shock and we were hard aground 
deep holes were gashed in the ships underbelly she was impaled 
on a rock the size of a volkswagen and warm oil was bubbling into 
the cold clear waters of prince william sound in all the ship 
belched out nearly 11 million gallons of alaska north slope crude 
oil in a hemorrhage that killed countless birds fish and wildlife 
on the richly populated sound the rocky shore turned black for 
hundreds of miles 
whats the problem a coast guard investigator asked 
hazelwood upon boarding the crippled ship 
i think youre looking at it said the captain in a comment 
which planted the idea that the skipper was accepting blame his 
lawyers would say that was his training talking a captain always 
takes responsibility for his ship 
one issue which consumed half the trial was whether hazelwood 
in the frantic moments after grounding tried to drive his ship off 
the reef he denied it but prosecutors tried to show he risked 
capsizing the tanker and killing the crew 
the issue became moot when the defense proved the ship was 
immovable and the judge agreed hazelwood could not be convicted of 
trying something that was impossible

a senior pentagon official on thursday refused 
to rule out giving up the railgarrison mx nuclear missile if the 
soviets give up their ss24 missile as part of the negotiations to 
reduce strategic weapons 
this is obviously a serious proposal advanced by serious 
people and needs to be given serious consideration stephen 
hadley assistant secretary of defense for international security 
policy told a house armed services subcommittee on defense policy 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of both the subcommittee and 
the parent committee criticized the bush administrations current 
proposal in ussoviet strategic arms talks the start talks that 
would keep the b2 stealth bomber and two landbased nuclear 
missiles 
aspin and subcommittee members of both parties warned that the 
chances were slim of congress approving all 132 b2 bombers the air 
force wants as well as future funds for two missiles the 
singlewarhead midgetman on the drawing boards and the railmobile 
multiplewarhead mx missile now deployed in underground silos 
were not going to buy 132 bombers and i maintain its not a 
responsible position for the us government to pursue arms control 
based on buying 132 said rep john kasich rohio 
i cant tell you how many were going to buy i cant tell you 
the planes going to work 
aspin asked hadley and lt gen gl butler director of 
strategic plans and policy for the joint chiefs of staff for their 
opinions of a scenario in which the untied states had 15 b2 
bombers and no midgetman or railgarrison mx missiles 
i dont want to leave the impression here that we walk away 
from start hadley replied if there are some things that 
disrupt that linkage then we have to go to the bottom line take a 
look and see if there are some adjustments 
aspin replied save some time and make the adjustments now 
steve trade on the missile to get rid of the soviet ss24 
earlier aspin had suggested trading the soviets ss24 missile 
for current us plans to move the mx missile to railroad cars and 
pressed hadley for a response 
there are a lot of proposals and ideas that are being 
considered a lot of them around town this is obviously one of 
them thats being offered and will be considered seriously 
hadley said 
aspin later pressed the officials about possible revisions in 
the nearly 10000 soviet targets the united states would likely 
attack in the event of nuclear war 
citing unclassified information aspin said the sites are 2000 
nuclear targets 1600 conventional weapons targets 4400 economic 
targets and 750 aimed at the soviet leadership the chairman 
stressed that with the reduced threat from the soviet union the 
target number should be changed 
hadley said the targets are reviewed regularly 
but aspin said the number remains constant and is being used 
up here to argue for the b2

randy simmons is a quadriplegic because he 
tried what he thought was a safe nonprescription food supplement 
to deal with pain and sleeplessness his lawyers say 
the food supplement was ltryptophan the 41yearold owner of a 
small accounting company is one of more than 1400 people 
nationwide who contracted a rare blood disorder 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome or ems after taking the product once 
touted in vitamin catalogs as natures tranquilizer 
researchers at the federal centers for disease control have 
recorded 19 deaths 
simmons and dozens of others have sued retailers suppliers and 
manufacturers of the amino acid which has been on the market for 
years cases of ems started showing up last summer but experts say 
the problem previously may have been misdiagnosed 
cdc has reports of 1411 cases in all 50 states the district of 
columbia and puerto rico california has the most cases with 239 
new york has reported 140 twelve states have more than 30 cases 
they are texas 72 ohio 72 florida 71 minnesota 63 oregon 
61 south carolina 53 pennsylvania 52 arizona 46 washington 
43 colorado 38 illinois 38 and new mexico 33 
ltryptophan was recalled by the food and drug administration in 
november on thursday louis sullivan health and human services 
secretary issued a strong warning against continued use calling 
the ems outbreak a major public health problem and warning that 
even small doses of ltryptophan could be harmful 
simmons is surviving thanks to a machine that breathes for him 
and a feeding tube that runs into his stomach he has limited use 
of his right arm and hand but his mental faculties are sharp and 
he still has feeling in his body and limbs his prognosis is 
uncertain 
weve talked to quite a few of the lawyers handling these 
cases nationwide and we havent heard of another case as serious 
in an ems survivor said arden bradshaw simmons attorney 
bradshaw has filed suit in sedgwick county district court 
seeking unspecified damages from six businesses retail stores and 
their suppliers for brands of ltriptophan that simmons took over 
the years 
four to six japanese manufacturers made the food supplement 
some investigators believe most of the people who have been 
stricken with ems took ltryptophan that can be traced to one 
manufacturer the cdc has not pinpointed the source of the problem 
one lawyer handling ltriptophan cases gayle troutwine of 
portland ore argues that showa denko co of japan is responsible 
for the outbreak because its product became contaminated a suit 
filed by troutwine last month on behalf of helen jones 52 of 
portland also claims showa denko has refused to cooperate with us 
officials investigating the supplement 
at the time the lawsuit was filed shotaro kawakatsu a 
spokesman in japan for showa denko noted that the fda was 
investigating the illness and said the company was awaiting the 
results of the study kawakatsu said his company had exported 
ltrytophan to the united states but declined to say how much 
showa denko is not named as a defendant in simmons suit 
bradshaw said he is still doing research to determine what company 
or companies manufactured the products his client took 
ltryptophan was touted as an aid for problems including high 
cholesterol high blood pressure tooth pain and depression 
simmons began taking it about 2 years ago because he was having 
trouble sleeping in part because of recurring pain from injuries 
suffered in a 1983 auto accident simmons found he was able to 
sleep better but last september he realized something was very 
wrong he was losing weight eventually more than 80 pounds and 
experiencing severe muscle pain 
doctors looked for cancer parasites and other diseases before 
finally diagnosing ems which is characterized by an abnormally 
high white blood cell count 
on nov 6 simmons went to the mayo clinic in rochester minn 
for treatments that included chemotheraphy and a blood cleansing 
process hes now back in a wichita hospital it hasnt been 
determined whether the effort stopped his decline 
linda simmons his 35yearold wife said her husband has been 
too ill to become angry about his situation but she has fought 
depression and other problems as she struggled to take care her 
husband of seven years their son 3 and their daughter 1 
ive had a good deal of anger about it she said but 
there are no boundaries or definitions for whats going on what 
should i be angry at

eastern airlines and its pilots union have agreed 
to an interim contract that calls for a 25 percent wage cut but 
does not call for rehiring pilots who went on strike the company 
said thursday 
and the carrier insisted it needs twice that amount in 
concessions by the time the contract expires on july 1 to emerge 
successfully from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
the wage cut applies to eastern pilots still being paid at the 
prestrike wage rate eastern had 3600 union pilots who honored 
picket lines when a sympathy strike with machinists began in march 
1989 since then many pilots have returned replacements have been 
hired at lower wages and the airline has sold many routes 
time to resolve the dispute regrettably has just about run 
out in light of the reorganization timetable said thomas j 
matthews senior vice president of human resources for the carrier 
which is owned by texas air corp 
eastern air line pilots association spokesman edward breen 
charged that the company intends to use the temporary agreement 
which was negotiated with the help of the national mediation board 
as a device to crush the union 
he said by demanding more concessions in advance eastern hoped 
to push the talks into a final impasse 
their first preference would be to have the nmb put us in a 
coolingoff period breen said thursday after that they can 
impose their own conditions 
breen said alpa executives had agreed in principle to the 
contract but it will not be signed until after a formal vote of 
the master executive committee on saturday in washington he said 
the union leaders reluctantly went along with the interim contract 
to show they were bargaining in good faith and to persuade the 
mediation board to pressure eastern to do the same 
the wage cuts applies to about 850 eastern pilots still working 
at the prestrike average of 72000 a year a 25 percent cut would 
bring that average down to 54000 but it excludes about 950 
replacement pilots hired at an average 27500 when the strike 
began 
the new wage levels are among the lowest in the country for 
major carriers breen said 
an eastern pilot after this will make about 50 percent of what 
a united airlines pilot makes and they still cant make a 
profit he said 
there was no agreement on the key sticking point of hiring back 
more of the pilots who went on strike 
the agreement does not cover that it covers only wages and 
benefits eastern spokesman robin matell said and the simple 
fact is that no jobs are available now 
the intertim agreement calls for a reduction in the airlines 
contribution to the pilots pension plan increased pilot 
contributions to their medical and dental insurance and the 
preservation of tougher work rules in effect since the strike 
eastern insisted federal mediators would have to continue 
efforts to reach a permanent agreement to cut costs further 
if expedited mediation is not successful in leading to such an 
arrangement eastern will have to promptly seek bankruptcy 
court permission to achieve full cost reductions on a longterm 
basis eastern said in its statement 
easterns alpa contract expired in june 1988 but its provisions 
had remained in effect under the railway labor act 
eastern lost 2826 million in the last quarter of 1989 
bringing total losses for the year to 8523 million or almost all 
of houstonbased texas airs 8856 million loss

a pair of prominent physists who said the 
super collider would let scientists learn more about the big bang 
failed thursday to win over some house republicans who cant get 
past the projects big price 
i find a number of americans regard the super collider as a 
superexpensive super hole money pit of the 90s said rep 
silvio conte rmass 
the 8 billion super collider is a 54mile underground tunnel 
to be built south of dallas in which streams of protons guided by 
powerful electromagents would be hurled into each other at almost 
the speed of light breaking up into exotic smaller particles in 
the collisions 
tsungdao lee professor of physics at columbia university 
testified the high collision energy of the super collider 20 
times what is available today would recreate the physical state 
that existed in our universe about one millionth of a billionth 
of a second after the big bang in which scientists believe the 
universe was created some 20 billion years ago 
our aim is to understand that set of laws which governs 
everything lee said the super collider makes a direct route 
toward achieving this understanding it will be our contribution to 
the civilization of the next century 
what i dont understand is why the physics community considers 
the super collider such an urgent project conte said have 
physicists run out of things to do 
conte also questioned whether the super collider would be 
obsolete before its operational in 1998 sidney d drell deputy 
director of the stanford linear accelerator center said he did not 
think so 
theres no way we can miss getting fundamental information 
drell said 
rep tom bevill chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on energy and water development called the scientists 
to capitol hill to explain the importance of building the super 
collider as he seeks congressional approval of secondyear 
construction funds for the project 
originally said to cost 44 billion the energy department 
later increased the price to 59 billion and now says design 
changes and higher labor costs are pushing the total closer to 8 
billion congress agreed to spend 225 million on the project in 
the current fiscal year and the bush administration is seeking 318 
million in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
rep john myers rind ranking republican on the 
appropriations energy subcommittee complained about the latest 
cost increase and said the collider if it survives cant 
survive another one i think it could be jeopardized now 
opponents of the super collider have suggested the united states 
join a european consortium building another accelerator but drell 
said that 1 billion collider would have onethird the science 
onethird the energy and would go onethird of the way we want 
to go with the super collider

the bush administration asked a federal 
appeals court thursday to dispel a legal cloud that could delay the 
presidents savings and loan bailout and cost taxpayers millions of 
dollars 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision is 
appealing an order from us district judge royce c lamberth 
blocking the takeover of a suburban chicago savings institution 
with 11 billion in assets 
lamberth sided with olympic savings and loan association 
berwyn ill in ruling wednesday that acting thrift office 
director salvatore r martoche and his predecessor m danny wall 
were unconstitutionally appointed 
government attorneys said lamberths preliminary injunction 
could unleash a flood of similar challenges they asked the us 
court of appeals to stay the order and then consider their appeal 
on an expedited basis 
institutions that are rapidly losing money and fear that they 
might be placed into receivership are likely to follow olympics 
lead thereby adding millions of dollars to the already 
costly thrift crisis the administration said in a memo to the 
appellate court 
on a more sinister level management that may be looting some 
thrifts may sue to block anticipated enforcement action it 
continued in short the district courts ruling places a 
cloud over the agencys authority to conduct its operations a 
cloud that will likely have a profound impact on the thrift 
offices ability to deal effectively with the continuing thrift 
crisis 
about 600 of 2600 sampls nationally fall short of capital 
requirements and may eventually be seized 
late wednesday within hours of lamberths ruling the parent 
company of imperial savings association a 10 billion thrift in 
california asked the us district court in san diego to overturn 
its feb 23 seizure 
franklin savings association a large sampl in ottawa kan filed 
a similar suit last week in federal court in topeka 
olympic contended and lamberth agreed that wall was improperly 
appointed when congress dismantled his old agency the federal home 
loan bank board and transferred many of its duties to the new 
thrift office 
the sampl law automatically gave wall the thrift office job 
lamberth said wall should have been nominated by president bush and 
confirmed by the senate as required by the constitution 
bush appointed martoche on an acting basis after wall resigned 
march 5 martoche had been confirmed by the senate as an assistant 
secretary of the treasury and normally could temporarily fill in as 
thrift office director in this case however lamberth said 
martoche cannot do that because he succeeded someone who had not 
legally held the job 
the thrift office regulates solvent sampls turning them over to 
the resolution trust corp when they fail the rtc created in 
august by the bailout law has taken control of 402 sampls so far 
disposing of 52 of them 
rtc chairman l william seidman said his agencys attorneys were 
studying the matter but said the two situations were different 
because the rtc is in effect a subordinate agency to the federal 
deposit insurance corp 
he said rtc attorneys were also looking into whether the agency 
can proceed with sales of sampls already in government control but 
he conceded that buyers may be wary even if the rtc concludes it 
can

house leaders reported being close to reaching 
a bipartisan agreement thursday on a bill to help families with 
child care including care provided at churchsponsored centers 
closeddoor negotiations between democrats republicans and the 
white house cleared away most differences on the legislation 
prompting both sides to hold out hope an agreement could be reached 
by next week 
we are very close said rep thomas downey dny one of 
the sponsors of a democratic version 
weve been hearing for some time were just inches away just 
a smidgen away from agreement said the house republican leader 
bob michel who was not participating in the direct negotionations 
rep clay shaw rfla sponsor of a conservative alternative 
called the progress toward an agreement between the administration 
house republicans and house democrats nothing short of 
incredible 
house speaker thomas foley said the negotiations if successful 
would produce a landmark bill he said house debate was 
scheduled for next wednesday and predicted passage before the end 
of march

to families for childcare expenses provide vouchers for use by 
parents to subsidize care and provide more aid for head start and 
other programs 
democratic leaders have yet to produce their version in writing 
but in negotiations they agreed to provisions permitting federal 
support go to churchsponsored day care centers including those 
where sectarian instruction was offered 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the democratic leaders also agreed to provisions sought by 
republicans and conservative democrats to require states adopt a 
program issuing vouchers to lowincome families for childcare 
subsidies 
in return they were seeking republican acceptance of a new 
program of before and afterschool child care based in schools

a federal judge approved a settlement thursday 
that keeps the state from restricting abortions to women less than 
18 weeks pregnant 
us district judge john nordberg agreed to the settlement 
between illinois attorney general neil hartigan and the american 
civil liberties union 
the court finds the proposed consent decree lawful fair 
reasonable and adequate the judge wrote in the 13page opinion 
antiabortion groups opposed the settlement calling it 
unconscionable and unconstitutional 
ragsdale vs turnock was settled nov 24 just days before the 
us supreme court was scheduled to hear the case it was one of 
several that antiabortion groups had hoped would be used as a test 
case for the 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
the settlement permits the state to regulate abortion clinics 
without removing the availability of abortions to women who are 
less than 18 weeks pregnant 
under the agreement access to abortions cannot be restricted by 
substantially increasing the cost of the procedure or reducing the 
number of clinics 
the lawsuit was brought by rockford physician richard ragsdale 
who objected to regulations requiring abortion clinics to be 
equipped and staffed like small hospitals 
he said the regulation was a veiled attempt to restrict access 
to abortions 
one of the requirements deleted from the settlement mandated 
that patients receive counseling about birth control and adoption 
and that counselors be people who wouldnt profit from abortions 
the settlement also eliminated a requirement that all abortion 
clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a 
certificate of need from the state verifying that they do not 
duplicate similar services in their areas

sweden has put its military on a higher 
state of alert after reports of soviet troop movements in the 
republic of lithuania defense officials said thursday 
there have been changes in the frame of our basic alert 
which marginally increase the state of preparedness said defense 
spokeswoman kari hansson 
among other measures she said more pilots than usual were on 
call 
lithuanians complained of increased soviet military activity 
after the republic declared itself independent from moscow on march 
11 president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday ordered lithuanians 
to turn in their firearms within seven days and soviet armor rolled 
through vilnius streets on thursday 
civilian authorities on the island of gotland in the baltic sea 
said they were preparing for a possible influx of lithuanian 
refugees escaping by boat in case the situation deteriorates 
gotland a summer holiday island for many swedes is 100 miles 
northwest of the lithuanian port of klaipeda 
there is an unusual military activity in the baltics right 
now maj gen bertel osterdahl told national news agency tt 
he said the swedish defense was closely following the changes of 
deployments including a paratroop unit in the lithuanian city of 
kaunas 
there are already a total of 50000 soviet soldiers in the 
baltics he said in lithuania there is about 10000 members 
of the national militia reports from lithuania put the number of 
soviet troops at 30000 
osterdahl said the soviet troop movements seemed to be a show of 
force but added the baltics are so important for the soviet 
union that it would never give up its bases there

people are buying guns security systems and 
forming community watches in the neighborhood where an intruder 
hacked to death a woman in her home 
fear set in after the body of geneva mcdonald was found in her 
upstairs bedroom in the home she had lived in for 20 years she was 
bludgeoned and police said they believe the weapon was an ax 
officials know of three other incidents in days before her death 
in which a prowler or prowlers used axes or mauls to try to break 
into homes in the upscale queen anne hill neighborhood just north 
of downtown seattle 
i would love to move out of the city the state the country 
right about now but i cant said lisa hawes 33 who lives with 
her husband and 2yearold son four houses away 
its been a rough week up here its the buzz at all the stops 
you go the grocery store the cleaners she added right now 
this is not a fun place to be living 
mcdonalds twostory yellow house is roped off with police tape 
authorities believe the 63yearold secretary for a shipbuilding 
company was killed as she slept during the night of march 1112 
ten detectives are investigating and 10 officers cruise the 
neighborhood that had been patrolled by two officers said maj joe 
tolliver commander of the police departments criminal 
investigation division 
burglary is the only suspected motive but police havent 
determined that anything was taken even though the house was 
ransacked 
theyre comparing fingerprints found at the house with those in 
a crime computer checking the whereabouts of recently released 
convicts and trying to develop a profile of the killer 
police informed a crowded neighborhood meeting tuesday evening 
about the progress of the investigation but did not yet have a 
suspect hawes said following the meeting 
tolliver said he couldnt recall another seattle homicide 
involving an ax 
but between march 1 and 3 someone used a woodsplitting maul in 
an attempt to break into a nearby condominium smashing the knob on 
a storage room door 
on march 4 a man living in a nearby home heard his basement 
door window being broken he turned on a floodlight and frightened 
away the prowler who left behind an ax hawes said the homeowner 
and his wife both in their 80s were so frightened they began 
staying with a relative 
on march 9 a man in another nearby home awoke to discover his 
back door open and found an ax that had been on his back porch in 
his living room nothing was taken and police found no fingerprints 
right after mcdonalds death there was panic neighborhood 
residents said then there was hope the killer knew his victim 
which at least would mean there was no random psychopath 
terrorizing the neighborhood 
there was no sign of forced entry police dont know whether 
mcdonald divorced and living alone normally left doors and 
windows unlocked or hid a key outdoors 
she had been the captain of a small block watch program among 
neighbors who shared the same alley hawes said 
some residents have bought guns said a widow in her 60s who 
spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisal others 
have installed security systems many are organizing new block 
watch programs with the help of police 
now theres no place to go no place to move in seattle 
the woman said that creep will strike someplace else he 
will do it again 
kirk robbins chairman of the queen anne community council said 
he had not heard of particular person buying guns since the slaying 
but added that it wouldnt surprise him 
neighbors now say they have cleared their yards of dangerous 
tools exterior lights remain on all night families no longer 
leave keys hidden outdoors 
we used to be able to leave doors open hawes said now 
you feel isolated like your house is a fortress or something 
mcdonald had planned to retire soon her neighbor said 
she was the nicest nicest woman said hawes she was a 
great gardener always throwing out botanical names and losing me 
i try to remember jenny walking down the street not lying in 
bed butchered

a 15yearold girl who squeezed through a dog 
door at her friends house found the message scrawled in black 
crayon on the dining room wall god please forgive me 
elsewhere she found the bodies of an outofwork single mother 
and her three children all shot to death in what police described 
as an act of desperation by a woman overwhelmed by her marital and 
financial difficulties 
the family dog also had been shot and killed 
were about 99 percent complete with the initial investigation 
and were pretty sure what happened there was a murdersuicide 
detective rick swanston said thursday there isnt anything 
pointing in any other direction 
crystal erickson discovered the bodies in suburban reseda after 
school wednesday afternoon 
she also found a fivepage suicide note by roxanne fernandez 
jones 32 who said she loved her children and hated to put them 
through living in a world full of strife the daily news reported 
investigators found brandy fernandez 16 and her sister 
leticia 13 in their beds each shot in the head and chest 
swanston said jeremiah jones 7 was shot to death in his mothers 
bed and her body was found nearby with a smallcaliber rifle 
for police the remaining task involves examining evidence and 
tying up a few administrative loose ends swanston said 
but for jones relatives friends and neighbors there remain 
questions that may never be answered 
people suffer behind closed doors said gloria allred an 
attorney involved in womens rights issues 
its a common problem with single parents after separation and 
before legal proceedings to be in a financial and emotional 
crisis 
jones had been receiving support from her first husband joaquin 
fernandez and she was recently separated from jeremiahs father 
police said 
if there was an informal arrangement for him to pay some of 
the bills i dont know swanston said 
studies by harvard sociologist lenore weitzman have shown that 
single mothers tend to suffer the most in the first year after 
divorce experiencing a 73 percent decline in their standard of 
living by contrast men typically experience a 42 percent 
improvement in living standards 
jones recently had stopped working for the salvation army and 
apparently had been unable to find steady work friends and 
neighbors said she had been babysitting and picking up odd jobs 
for extra money and recently asked neighbors for small amounts of 
money 
brandy her eldest had contributed her pay from a pizzeria to 
help feed the family before she was laid off from her job a week 
ago said her boyfriend derek shelton 18 
everything just wasnt going well for her lance johnson a 
neighbor and friend told the los angeles times 
i cant believe she did this said joyce pacheco who lives 
around the corner roxanne never seemed depressed about

thousands of antihungarian 
demonstrators rallied on thursday for a fourth straight day of 
protest in this transylvanian city where ethnic clashes have left 
seven dead and 300 wounded 
they dispersed peacefully in the evening after deputy prime 
minister gelu voican promised them that transylvania would remain 
part of romania 
nobody is going to take transylvania away from us dont let 
yourselves be fooled by rumors he told the crowd of about 3000 
as troops and tanks made a show of force on the square of roses 
focal point of tuesday nights carnage when most of the casualties 
occurred 
earlier thursday about 3000 romanians and 1000 ethnic 
hungarians gathered at opposite ends of the square to shout 
slogans separated by soldiers 
voican was in tirgu mures a city of 165000 northwest of 
bucharest to lead the central governments efforts to defuse the 
worst crisis since the december revolution 
long suppressed under former communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu the ethnic hungarians have demanded greater autonomy and 
wrung some concessions from the current provisional government of 
president ion iliescu including reopening hungarianlanguage 
schools closed by ceausescu 
many romanians resent the concessions as favoritism they 
believe that nationalistic ethnic hungarians supported by the 
hungarian government are trying to engineer the transfer of 
transylvania to hungary 
voicans committee of inquiry met with hungarian and romanian 
community leaders and then put together a communique which voican 
outlined in an interview with the associated press 
the hungarian side agreed that there could be no talk of 
secession voican said adding that the communique contains a 
guarantee by the romanian side to the hungarians 
he did not specify the nature of the guarantee 
the communique called for an end to the work stoppages that hit 
nearly all major factories in the area on thursday 
it also provided for formation of a mixed commission to 
investigate all intercommunal complaints and settle them 
but voican said the final and definitive guarantees to both 
sides cannot be given until after the coming elections both sides 
have accepted that 
romanias first free elections since 1937 are set for may 20 
and will establish a parliamentary system of government 
until then the country will continue to be led by the council 
of national unity an amalgam of the national salvation front that 
took power during the revolution and dozens of opposition parties 
that have sprung up or revived since then 
voican told the romanians in the square the representatives 
of the hungarian people have gone on record that they dont want to 
secede from romania 
liars liars the crowd roared back 
he appealed for calm and told the crowd conflicts can only 
be solved through dialogue 
but emotions still ran high 
in nearby ungheni former political detainee ioan hodos a 
romanian told the ap in this part of romania racial 
discrimination is just like in south africa 
history teacher dumitru botos also a romanian said people 
in the south of the country perceive things differently than we do 
here they do not see the dangers posed by the hungarians who in 
fact want privileges 
mountainous transylvania has about 2 million ethnic hungarians 
and about 5 million romanians 
in budapest the capital of hungary the hungarian government 
and political parties issued statements condemning the bloodshed in 
tirgu mures 
the government statement accused the romanian government of 
hesitating to take resolute action to put down the revival of 
chauvinism in romania 
it asked the bucharest leadership to condemn the violence and 
protect ethnic hungarians 
hungary ruled translylvania for centuries before 1920 when the 
region was ceded to romania by the victorous allied powers in 
return for its siding with the allies in world war i 
on thursday the army appeared to be the only factor keeping the 
two sides apart in ths city despite the presence of the commission 
of inquiry 
the army is here to keep the peace without this no mans 
land they would tear each other apart said a captain of the 
parachute regiment that flew in wednesday he spoke on condition 
that he remain anonymous

the federal government has ordered a temporary 
halt to the capture of bottlenose dophins in the gulf of mexico as 
scientists attempt to determine the cause of an unusually high 
string of stranding deaths since early january 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration announced 
the ban on dolphin collections late wednesday and said it would 
remain in effect through at least june 15 
william w fox jr noaas assistant administrator for 
fisheries said the national marine fisheries service will not 
hesitate to obtain agreement for an extension of the noncapture 
period or to protect further the dolphins as the situation 
demands 
according to noaa more than 190 dolphins have been stranded and 
died since jan 1 in five gulf states 118 in texas more than 40 
to 45 on the barrier islands of louisiana and mississippi 21 in 
the alabamaflorida panhandle and 10 in floridas tampa bay 
the dolphins have been stranded at four to five times the usual 
rate for the time of year and the dieoff continues a noaa 
spokesman said 
although cold weather is believed responsible for the deaths of 
26 dolphins in texas matagorda bay the noaa spokesman said this 
thing could involve a number of reasons 
until the past week or so adult dolphins have been the victims 
but scientists are now watching to assess how the calving season 
will be affected 
during the calving season which began during the second week of 
march and goes into april some pups and females die 
were going to try to keep as close track on it as possible a 
number of tissue samples are in laboratories for analysis and we 
dont know how long it will take to analyze them or whether well 
be able to draw any sort of conclusions the spokesman said 
under the marine mammal protection act the bottlenose dolphins 
are considered a protected but not endangered or threatened 
species 
according to noaa 11 organizations hold permits to collect live 
dolphins but only three do the actual collecting the dolphins can 
be taken for educational purposes such as aquariums or marinetype 
theaters 
the national marine fisheries service contacted dolphin 
collectors for the 11 permit holders and they volunteered to 
suspend collections during the time period fox said 
the quota on live dolphin collections was 91 last year and was 
to be 91 this year although the government had considered reducing 
it to 35 
everything is on hold now the spokesman said theyre not 
going to capture any dolphins until june 15 and there could be an 
extension the spokesman said a lot depends on whether the 
dieoff continues whether it slows down or halts we have to 
figure out what caused the dieoff

federal prosecutors denied they engaged in 
any misconduct in the espionage case against former fbi agent 
richard miller saying a motion for dismissal of charges is 
wholly without merit 
miller 52 was tried on espionage charges twice the first 
trial ended in a hung jury in 1985 the next year a jury convicted 
him of trading a secret fbi manual to soviet informant svetlana 
ogorodnikov in exchange for sex and money 
the conviction was overturned by the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals last april and miller was released on bail last october 
his third trial is scheduled to begin july 10 before us district 
court judge robert m takasugi 
defense lawyers claimed in a motion filed in january that 
charges against miller should be dismissed because prosecutors 
intentionally withheld information that could have benefited them 
the nature of the information was not disclosed 
but two justice department lawyers told the court in briefs 
filed wednesday that the defense has conveyed a false sense of 
conspiracy and wrongdoing on the part of the government 
assistant us attorneys russell hayman and adam schiff 
described the defense motion as a rehashing of old issues 
with a new face that was wholly without merit 
they said defense contentions were rejected by us district 
judge david kenyon who presided over millers trials and the trial 
of mrs ogorodnikov with whom miller had an affair in 1984 
kenyon removed himself from the case and takasugi took over

operators briefly shut down the seabrook 
nuclear power in only its third day of operation because of a false 
alarm thursday but a federal inspector called the move 
conservative 
noel dudley resident inspector at seabrook for the nuclear 
regulatory commission said plant operator new hampshire yankee 
shut down the reactor because of a spurious alarm received 
intermittently from one of five banks of electronic controls for 
the reactors control rods 
dudley said each bank of controls has multiple power supply 
units and that nuclear power plants can operate safely for months 
with one unit out of service 
he agreed that the decision to shut down was conservative 
they could have continued to operate he said 
dudley said in a telephone interview from seabrook that the 
reactor was shut down about 830 am it was put back in operation 
at 2 pm 
a plant spokesman twice declined to confirm that the reactor had 
been shut down rob williams said he didnt know and would not 
bother the control room to find out 
we said all along that there would be shutdowns and i dont 
know whether there have been williams said 
he said he wouldnt call the control room because we have made 
a conscious decision that we are not going to be distracting the 
control room staff for updates about the power level 
plant officials have said reaching full power could take two to 
three months and that they expect problems 
theyre progressing with their startup very deliberately 
dudley said theyve not made any attempt to maintain their 
schedule theyre identifying problems and resolving those 
problems before they continue 
other problems encountered during the first three days included 
a steam leak from a valve in the plants turbine building and a 
slight hydraulic leak dudley said he said replacing sealing 
rings fixed both problems 
he said the problems were not surprising 
a plant thats been sitting idle for over eight years even 
with the best of maintenance you would expect that when you began 
to operate you would identify some components of some systems 
that would require work he said 
the delay was caused by regulation changes and court battles by 
opponents of the plant 
seabrook foe robert backus lawyer for the 
seacoastantipollution league said the problems confirm that 
this plant is not ready and the license should not have been 
issued 
if you went and bought a car this is supposed to be a 
cadillac right and you couldnt drive it the first mile because 
there was a problem that required you to shut it down you might 
want to take it back he said

president bush said thursday that hes an 
expert when it comes to running a political campaign against women 
but at least one female politician took exception to the contention 
i dont know how hed call himself an expert former rep 
geraldine ferraro said from new york only in politics does one 
little meeting an expert make 
ferraro was walter mondales vice presidential running mate in 
the 1984 race against incumbent president reagan and vice president 
bush 
bushs comments at a news conference were prompted by a question 
about the texas gubernatorial race that may pit democrat ann 
richards against republican clayton williams 
williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against 
richards than attorney general jim mattox richards the state 
treasurer and mattox will battle for the democratic nomination in 
an april 10 runoff election 
bush said he had some opinions about running against women 
calling himself an expert in the field because of his contest 
against ferraro 
but ferraro said bushs memory of the race is flawed and that 
the only time they went headtohead was in one televised debate 
we did not run against each other it was fritz mondale and 
ronald reagan who were running against each other ferraro said 
if we were both running against each other if we were both at 
the top of the ticket then i think his comment about being an 
expert would be valid 
bush was asked if he had any advice for williams 
i have none at all but i know exactly what he means and i 
refuse to elaborate on it bush said 
ferraro meanwhile said richards didnt need any advice from 
her 
ann has run against men before im sure shes not 
uncomfortable with it ferraro said suggesting williams problem 
may be a common male ailment 
the only way i can see it being uncomfortable is when you 
lose to a man its humiliating enough she said but if youre 
a macho guy and you lose to a woman it has to be devastating

american farmers have been guaranteed a major 
portion of the soviet unions grain import market for another five 
years officials announced thursday 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and us trade 
representative carla a hills said a tentative agreement in 
principle was reached during negotiations in vienna 
the current pact which has been in effect since 1983 expires 
dec 31 
the new accord will increase the annual minimum shipments of 
us grain to the soviets to 10 million metric tons from 9 million 
tons a guarantee of 50 million tons over the five years compared 
with 45 million tons under the old terms 
soviet purchases in most years have exceeded the required 
minimums in 198889 for example sales were more than double the 
specified minimum 
we think this is a good deal that it assures us farmers of 
a stable market over the life of the agreement julius katz 
deputy us trade representative said in vienna 
katz said details of the pact would be disclosed after it is 
signed at the june summit meeting between president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
howard lyman a lobbyist for the national farmers union said 
the pact was in line with the groups support of such longterm 
agreements 
we think its great he said 
however economist john a schnittker questioned whether the 
agreement was needed 
ive never considered these agreements to be necessary for 
continuation of trade he said in my opinion we would be 
selling just as much they need the stuff weve got the stuff 
theyre going to buy it when they need it 
farmers welcomed the announcement but some restrained their 
enthusiasm until they could learn more 
im not going to jump up and down and say this is great stuff 
until i have all the details said gary rees who farms 550 acres 
at crawfordsville iowa 
i really dont know how big a deal it really is said dick 
naeve of humboldt who works 750 acres at humboldt iowa he 
observed their people want a better diet so theyre probably 
going to have to import more over the next couple of years 
commodity markets barely reacted at all traders said the news 
had been epected wheat futures closed cent per bushel lower to 
1 cents lower corn was cent to 1 cents higher 
the kremlin will have some greater yeartoyear flexibility 
under the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat 
and feed grains although over the life of the pact the minimums 
will be met officials said 
under the agreement the soviets will be committed to buying at 
least 4 million tons each of wheat and feed grains however in any 
one year moscow may substitute up to 750000 tons of one commodity 
for the other 
for the first time the agreement includes barley and sorghum as 
well as corn under the definition of feed grains 
additional flexibility also was provided by giving moscow 
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually 
without further discussion with washington 
the automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons 
although the united states has routinely increased that to fit 
soviet needs 
as of march 8 the soviets had bought more than 138 million 
tons of us wheat and corn under the current agreement for 
delivery this year last years sales totaled a record 217 million 
tons 
effectively over five years us farmers will be assured a 
soviet market for at least 20 million tons of wheat and 20 million 
tons of feed grains with an additional 10 million tons that can be 
made up of wheat feed grains soybeans or soybean meal 
although it makes up a hefty share the soviet unions grain 
purchases by no means tell the whole story of us grain exports 
total wheat shipments in 198990 are forecast at 354 million 
tons and socalled coarse grains or feed grains at 664 million 
tons

five astronauts who will deploy the 
15 billion hubble space telescope from the shuttle discovery said 
thursday excitement is mounting at nasa as the april 12 launch date 
draws closer 
the astronomical observatory nearly seven years late in lifting 
off will be placed in orbit 370 miles above earth and enable 
scientists to see things so distant that their light has taken 
almost since the beginning of the universe to reach earth 
i think i can speak for everybody in that we can feel the 
excitement building quite a bit now in these last few weeks were 
just glad to be finally this close to launch said air force col 
loren j shriver the crews commander 
well all feel a little bit of disbelief that were finally 
getting to do this well probably all feel a certain amount of 
pride mission specialist steven a hawley said at a news 
conference 
hawley is scheduled to use the shuttles robot arm to deploy the 
telescope on the second day of the fiveday mission 
i cant even begin to imagine how good were going to feel 
because its been so long said marine col charles f bolden 
jr the missions pilot 
the hubble the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built 
originally was scheduled for launch in late 1983 but technical 
problems postponed liftoff until 1985 and then 1986 the challenger 
explosion on jan 28 1986 delayed the mission until 1989 and 
concern over the shuttles solid fuel booster rockets pushed it 
back yet again 
from its orbit the 25000pound 43footlong telescope will be 
able to detect light of all wavelengths including ultraviolet 
before it is absorbed or distorted by the atmosphere 
the telescope will look seven times more deeply into space and 
detect objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity 
than the best groundbased observatory its eightfoot primary 
optical mirror is the most precise ever made 
astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant 
that their light has taken 14 billion years to reach earth 
scientists believe the universe is 15 billion years old 
the other crew members are mission specialists kathryn d 
sullivan and bruce mccandless ii a navy captain who both said 
they are ready to go on a spacewalk if necessary to repair or 
retrieve the observatory if necessary after deployment 
shriver said he is not concerned about damaged axle nuts found 
on the nose wheels of atlantis and columbia and suspected to be the 
same on discovery nasa temporarily delayed discoverys move to the 
launch pad last week until technicians concluded there was no 
threat to the mission 
because of their prestigious payload the astronauts have found 
themselves the subject of considerable attention and even a little 
envy within nasa 
theres no such thing as a bad mission hawley said but i 
think there are a lot of people who would like to trade places with 
us

the government expanded its recall of 
ltryptophan thursday because of fears that a sometimes fatal blood 
disorder can be caused even by small doses of the dietary 
supplement used for insomnia depression and weight control 
we are confronted with a major public health problem health 
and human services secretary louis sullivan warned in the 
announcement by the food and drug administration 
i urge everyone to stop taking these supplements immediately 
ltryptophan is an amino acid that occurs naturally in some 
foods that are high in protein such as milk beef turkey and 
beans but it is also sold over the counter as a manufactured 
dietary supplement and it may be contained in various diet and 
weight loss products 
it has been linked to a blood disorder called 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome or ems 
so far 1411 cases of ems including 19 deaths have been 
reported the fda said cases have been reported in every state 
the recall applies to all ltryptophan products in tablet 
capsule caplet powdered or liquid form as well multiingredient 
nonprotein supplements that contain ltryptophan the fda said 
the only products containing ltryptophan not being recalled are 
some protein supplements infant formulas special dietary foods 
intravenous and oral solutions in which small amounts of 
ltryptophan are needed for nutrition fortification the fda said 
no cases of ems have been linked to any of these uses the agency 
said 
it was not clear whether certain products like diet weight loss 
and bodybuilding supplements containing ltryptophan would have to 
be recalled some of these are formulated according to fda 
regulations the fda said it would issue a clarification further 
defining what is subject to the recall 
ltryptophan is not an fdaapproved drug ingredient and has not 
been considered a drug 
ltryptophan dietary supplements are sold in health food stores 
drug stores and supermarkets retail sales are estimated at 50 
million to 75 million a year 
buyers use the supplement for insomnia appetite control 
depression premenstrual syndrome stress reduction and other 
problems 
the council for responsible nutrition which represents 
manufacturers of nutritional supplements endorsed the fdas 
action its president jb cordaro said i wish theyd done it a 
month ago 
the council has been recommending for more than a month that its 
members stop distribution of all products that contain ltryptophan 
and that consumers stop using it he said 
cordaro said that the largest manufacturers of ltryptophan 
products have taken them off the market and if there are a few 
of the smaller ones that still have it its insignificant 
the council identified the two largest manufacturers of 
ltryptophan dietary supplements as p leiner nutritional products 
corp in torrance calif and pharmavite corp in arleta calif 
kevin lanigan senior vice president at p leiner said that a 
week before the fdas initial nov 17 recall the company stopped 
manufacture and shipping of all its ltryptophan products the 
company also notified all of its customers and advised them to 
remove it from their shelves he said 
neither lanigan or the fda could provide brand names of the 
products since hundreds of products are involved 
kenneth rosenberg chief executive officer of pharmavite corp 
said his company distributed ltryptophan dietary supplements under 
about 20 different brand names including its own brand nature 
made as well as store labels for various retail chains 
pharmavite also stopped shipping its products before the fdas 
initial recall last november and notified its customers and 
provided them with signs warning consumers about the problem said 
rosenberg 
fda spokesman chris lecos said the ltryptophan recall is 
unusual in that normally the fda identifies a specific hazard or 
contaminant and knows who the manufacturer is how much was made 
and where and when it was distributed 
ems is marked by severe muscle and joint pain breathing 
difficulties swelling of the arms and legs skin rash fatigue 
cough and sometimes fever in some cases victims show signs of 
congestive heart failure or develop a condition that causes 
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis 
sullivan warned ems can cripple it can cause great pain it 
can kill it has had longterm effects on some unfortunate 
individuals and some patients are not responding to treatment 
the fda initially recalled only the larger dose forms of the 
product those that would result in daily intake of 100 milligrams 
or more a day that was based on evidence from the federal centers 
for disease control in atlanta that ems victims had taken 
ltryptophan in doses that ranged from 150 to 17000 milligrams a 
day most were taking 1000 to 2000 milligrams daily 
however at least one case of the disorder has been reported on 
less than 100 milligrams a day the fda said 
the rate of ems has slowed dramatically since the initial nov 
17 recall but officials said some of the recent victims apparently 
had continued using ltryptophan products after the recall began 
the fda earlier was investigating whether ltryptophan itself or 
some contaminant introduced during manufacture or distribution was 
causing the syndrome fda investigators visited plants in japan a 
leading supplier of the raw ltryptophan to us manufacturers 
however investigators have been unable to identify any 
contaminants that could be responsible nor have they linked the 
illness to any single lot brand manufacturer or supplier 
the fdas action was taken after its health hazard evaluation 
board advised that the risk of contracting ems due to the 
consumption of any dietary ltryptophan product far outweighs any 
perceived benefit that may be derived from the continued marketing 
of this product in any dosage form

one of the last persons to receive a 
jarvik artifical heart before federal approval of the device was 
withdrawn died after surgery to replace the pump with a donor 
organ he spent 87 days on the device 
carl e bryant 43 of louisville died wednesday eight hours 
after the transplant operation said doctors at louisvilles jewish 
hospital 
we did everything we could for carl bryant said dr laman 
a gray jr who transplanted the heart 
physicians said the donor heart which became available late 
tuesday met the criteria for transplantation but the left 
ventricle or main pumping chamber failed to function once the 
heart was inside bryant 
the jarvik 770 assist device was implanted dec 22 at humana 
hospitalaudubon by dr william devries who pioneered use of the 
artificial heart 
the transplant surgery offered carls only real chance for 
survival devries said in a statement wednesday 
bryant was the secondtolast person to receive a jarvik pump in 
this country before the us food and drug administration withdrew 
its approval of the device jan 8 said gary cole an executive 
vice president with symbion inc the arizona manufacturer of the 
pumps 
the agency said its inspections uncovered serious 
deficiencies in the way symbion was carrying out studies with the 
device in february the fda said it would allow use of the device 
as a last resort but only when all other available treatments had 
failed and when no other lifesaving device could be used 
the device was last implanted in the united states in columbus 
ohio on dec 31 cole said thursday he said two jarvik pumps have 
been implanted in other countries since the fda withdrawal cole 
said 159 jarviks have been implanted as bridges to transplants 
since 1985 
he said the longestsurviving patient to use the jarvik while 
awaiting a donor organ was a french woman she lived 603 days on 
the device 
dr barney clark the first person implanted with a jarvik 
heart died in 1983 after 112 days on the device he received a 
jarvik7 which was supposed to be a premanent replacement for his 
heart 
bryant had a massive heart attack in july and underwent cardiac 
catheterization and angioplastic surgery in his left coronary 
artery 
his wife cynthia took him to the hospital dec 16 after he 
complained of chest pains three hours before he was to undergo 
triple bypass surgery bryant suffered a second massive heart 
attack 
devries implanted the jarvik device during a sixhour procedure 
i have no qualms about carl being on the assist device at 
all cynthia bryant said it worked wonderfully and may further 
research to help someone else and we had three good months 
together that we would not have had otherwise

lesothos military ruler who sent the 
king into exile last month claiming he needed a vacation said 
thursday he had staged a coup in this tiny southern african nation 
it was the first time maj gen justin lekhanya characterized 
what he did as a coup 
on feb 19 lekhanya dismissed all ministers who supported king 
moshoeshoe then on march 10 he sent the king himself into exile 
in england saying the monarch needed a rest 
lekhanyas statement thursday came in an affidavit to the high 
court former health minister strong makenete has filed a case with 
the court challenging his dismissal as invalid 
lekhanya said makenetes application was frivolous because he 
and other ministers were ousted in a coup the ruler said the 
council of ministers no longer exists 
lekhanya and his military council have held the government in 
sway since a january 1986 coup against leftist strongman leabua 
jonathan the military initially helped jonathan keep power after 
he lost a postindependence election 
lekhanya said the king retained legislative and executive powers 
after the 1986 coup but was supposed to govern with the advice of 
the military council 
last month lekhanya dismissed two highranking relatives of the 
king and other supporters of the monarch when moshoeshoe refused 
to approve replacements lekhanya stripped the king of authority 
and deported him 
lekhanya said he and his remaining supporters on the military 
council would govern until lesotho returns to civilian rule he has 
said that will take place in june 1992 
a statement signed by 14 of the countrys 22 traditional chiefs 
was published thursday objecting to the treatment of the king 
lesotho which became independent from britain in 1966 is 
completely surrounded by south africa

a house committee approved a compromise 
thursday on tougher smog controls in a clean air bill while a 
proposal for financial aid to coal miners still held up movement on 
similar legislation in the seante 
the 382 vote by the house energy and commerce committee created 
one areas of likely conflict when the senate and house versions of 
the two bills eventually have to be reconciled the senate earlier 
in the week rejected some of the same smog controls 
meanwhile senate leaders worked with the white house and sen 
robert byrd dwva in an attempt to find a way to resolve the 
dispute over the coal miner assistance 
a vote on the amendment brought to the floor by byrd nearly two 
weeks ago has been postponed at least twice senate leaders are 
fearful that byrd has the votes to get it passed that could 
unravel the compromise legislation worked out with the white house 
they fear because of the temptation it would pose for lawmakers to 
claim similar aid for other industries 
by evening the coal aid amendment had yet to surface again 
though majority leader george mitchell dmaine had said earlier 
in the day the matter would be resolved one way or another 
thursday 
the house committee vote came after two days of negotitions 
among committee leaders including rep john dingell dmich the 
chairman many members voted only minutes after having first seen 
the inchthick document 
the house provisions would continue to allow the environmental 
protection agency to impose an air pollution control plan if local 
officials fail to act would bring many small businesses under 
smogcontrol regulations in cities with the dirtiest air and would 
eliminate certain waivers now possible on grounds that compliance 
would cost too much these were provisions the senate rejected 
earlier in the week 
the senate spent much time on marginal amendments 
the byrd proposal calls for a 500 million program to help 
miners who lose their jobs from tougher acid rain pollution 
controls the white house calls the plan too expensive and has 
lobbied hard against it 
but byrd one of the senates most influential and most powerful 
members as chairman of the appropriations committee returned to 
the senate floor thursday to plead his case 
the coal miners are being asked to pay a very high price 
they will lose their livelihood declared byrd calling the 
assistance program essential to help 5000 miners who are likely to 
lose their jobs 
mitchell meanwhile was working with sen bob dole rkan the 
minority leader to try to get the white house to produce a 
compromise aid package that might be agreeable to byrd 
mitchell and dole have said they are concerned that passage of 
the assistance program would cause the white house to drop support 
for the compromise clean air legislation that was agreed to in 
lengthy closeddoor negotiations between senate leaders and the 
bush administration 
if the deal falls apart there likely will be no clean air bill 
from the senate this year mitchell maintained earlier in the week 
on wednesday night byrd offered to lower the packages expected 
cost from 700 million over four years to 500 million over three 
years now he said he would retreat no further 
im not going to stand here and say ive got 51 votes needed 
for passage but i can tell you you dont have 51 votes either 
and i can tell you im very close byrd told mitchell as debate 
on the issue continued late into the night wednesday 
byrd complained that the white house had been unwilling to 
negotiate with him so ive negotiated with myself originally 
byrd had sought a much broader aid package which could have cost 
16 billion over six years 
byrd argued that coal miners should be singled out for help 
because the bill which calls for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions 
from electric utilities by 10 million tons a year by the end of the 
decade takes direct aim at these workers 
industry has argued forcefully among senators in recent weeks 
that the tougher proposed controls on toxic industrial chemical 
releases would cost thousands of jobs in the steel chemical and 
petroleum industries

communists who refused to follow the 
reformist trend applauded warnings on thursday that a market 
economy and bourgeois ideas would destroy their hardwon 
welfare 
about 2000 people attended a rally in budapests peoples 
stadium to show support for the hungarian socialist workers party 
communists who refused to embrace reform that led others to 
renounce their stalinist past and opt for democracy 
the rally was held three days before hungarys first free 
national elections in 42 years and was attended by mostly elderly 
marxists 
the audience presented a marked contrast to the rollicking crowd 
gathered at the stadium wednesday to show support for fidesz the 
iconoclastic league of free democrats who have poked fun at the 
communists for much of the campaign 
after decades of assured singleparty rule the communists find 
they must scramble for votes if they hope to gain any seats at all 
in the new parliament 
we can bring back socialism with our vote appealed the 
splinter partys new leader gyula thuermer to rousing applause 
many of the crowd appeared to be bluecollar workers fidesz 
draws much of its support from collegeeducated adults 
there will be great unemployment if the capitalists take 
over the 36yearold thuermer warned lets preserve the unity 
of the workers dont believe what the bourgeois parties 
promise you 
the orderly audience applauded rhythmically in response to his 
promises of increased pensions free education and prospects for 
betterment he said that was all threatened by the coming democracy 
and market economy most other parties pledge to institute as the 
only way to pull hungary out of an economic slump

former attorney general edwin meese iii 
testified thursday he never became suspicious of john poindexter 
even when evidence suggested poindexter covered up the us role in 
a missile shipment to iran 
appearing as a defense witness at poindexters trial meese told 
the jury that everything i know suggests the former national 
security adviser tried to give him an accurate account of the 
november 1985 delivery at a meeting a year later 
did admiral poindexter ever tell you a lie asked defense 
attorney richard beckler 
not to my knowledge responded the former attorney general 
poindexter tried to convey an accurate story on the missile 
shipment asked beckler 
everything i know about it is he did said meese 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb questioned meese about a nov 
20 1986 meeting in poindexters office during which several 
participants including oliver north adopted a false cover story 
about the shipment the story was that no one in the us 
government knew at the time of the shipment that hawk missiles were 
aboard 
meese was asked if he knew then that poindexter had been 
involved in that hawks shipment 
no i did not know that then and i do not know that today 
meese replied 
webb showed meese a copy of a nov 20 1985 computer message 
from north to poindexter about the impending shipment meese 
responded by saying he didnt know whether poindexter received the 
message 
after the meeting in poindexters office meese was told by a 
political aide the us government may have known about the missile 
shipment after all two days later meese first learned that 
thenpresident reagan had signed a document known as a finding 
authorizing cia assistance in the shipment according to testimony 
at the congressional irancontra hearings 
wasnt meese suspicious about the assertions of no us 
knowledge when there was a presidential finding ratifying the 
shipment asked webb 
no i was not suspicious of that said meese the cia said it 
had found out about the missiles only as the shipment was under 
way and the finding was signed by reagan a week and a half after 
the delivery explained meese 
the politically embarrassing finding depicted the us role in 
iran arms sales as an attempt to trade arms for hostages 
poindexter tore up the document on nov 21 1986 hours talking 
with members of congress about the missile shipment 
the former national security adviser is accused of conspiracy 
obstructing congress and making false statements by saying that he 
didnt learn of the delivery until january 1986 
when meese told the president on nov 21 a factfinding inquiry 
was being started on the iran initiative did poindexter jump 
up and say he had a copy of the finding in my safe asked 
webb 
no he did not said meese 
during this time did john poindexter ever tell you he had 
destroyed this finding that had been signed by the president of the 
united states asked webb 
no replied meese 
at the nov 20 meeting at which poindexter presided did meese 
hear any discussion of a false cover story asked beckler 
no i did not replied meese i am sure nothing like that 
was ever said in my presence at that meeting 
meese said he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the 
information being presented by the cia and north 
why was it necessary for everybody to get together at the 
nov 20 1986 meeting asked us district court judge harold 
greene 
to prepare cia director william casey for his congressional 
testimony the next day on the iran initiative responded meese 
poindexter had asked meese to come to the meeting to ensure that 
reagan administration officials could testify truthfully and 
accurately meese said at one point 
earlier thursday poindexters lawyers finished the courtroom 
showing of nearly eight hours of videotaped testimony from reagan 
in it reagan suggested that it might have been all right to 
destroy documents or withhold information from congress in order to 
safeguard the lives of us hostages held in lebanon 
reagan said that if there were leaks from congress about aspects 
of the iran initiative the hostages could be endangered 
poindexter is accused of deleting 5000 files from his computer 
system to keep congress from knowing the us role in the missile 
shipment 
poindexter also is accused of conspiring with north to destroy 
and alter memos that showed norths military assistance to the 
contras 
is it fair to say that at no time in november of 1986 did 
you ever authorize any one at the national security council to 
destroy or alter any record that related to the irancontra 
controversy asked prosecutor dan webb 
i dont know replied reagan saying that he had pointed 
out that there were things that could not be made public because of 
the risk of death to a number of people 
there were times and experience that told us that congress was 
not in many instances capable of the kind of security that we 
required reagan said at one point

president vaclav havel said thursday that 
czechoslovakia sold libya 1000 tons of semtex explosive but will 
not be exporting any more of the virtually undetectable substance 
favored by terrorists 
security experts say semtex was used was the terrorist bombing 
of a pan am boeing 747 over lockerbie scotland in december 1988 
which killed 259 people on board the plane and 11 on the ground 
semtex made exclusively in czechoslovakia is an odorless 
orangeyellow explosive that looks like childrens playdough it 
can be molded into any shape and is 1000 times more powerful than 
conventional explosives it is almost undetectable to conventional 
antiterrorist devices 
havel speaking through a translator at a news conference at the 
czechoslovak embassy on the second day of a threeday official 
visit said if you consider that it takes 200 grams 7 ounces 
to blow up an aircraft this means world terrorism has enough 
semtex to last for 150 years 
havel did not say czechoslovakia would stop making semtex but 
defended its production for peaceful use 
this is an industrial explosive necessary for various 
industrial uses it is not an explosive made especially for 
terrorists he said but now we want to mark semtex so it will 
be detectable 
the past regime exported 1000 tons to libya we ceased 
exporting this explosive some time ago 
havel who became president last dec 29 gave no date or 
details 
but jiri novy director of the plant northeast of prague that 
makes semtex told the associated press that exports stopped in 
1988 
he said libya received over 900 tons of the explosive in 
1981 and that additional exports were made to eastern europe until 
1988 
the british foreign office said formal exports of semtex 
continued to hungary and east germany until 1989 
britains press association said semtex has been the irish 
republican armys chief weapon against british rule in northern 
ireland since late 1986 and was used in the september bombing of 
the royal marines school of music in kent which killed 10 people 
the news agency quoting unidentified security officials said 
the explosive was smuggled into ireland from libya in 1985 and 1986 
traces of a chemical constituent of semtex were found in the 
wreckage of a uta dc10 that blew up over niger in 1989 killing 
170 people 
czechoslovakia has long been a major arms manufacturer it 
produces hand grenades automatic rifles tanks and armored 
personnel carriers 
published reports say the export of such weapons and components 
accounted for up to onehalf of czechoslovakias foreignexchange 
earnings the nation suffering from a crumbling economy and 
strapped for hard currency may find it difficult to stop the trade 
under the hardline communist regime of milos jakes and gustav 
husak czechoslovakia found a market among nations too poor to 
afford expensive western weapons or those denied access for 
political reasons 
besides libya clients included angola south yemen and the 
palestine liberation organization 
havel promised on tuesday that czechoslovakias arms industry 
will no longer sell weapons to dictatorial or totalitarian regimes 
we are studying reconversion of our military industry he 
told a news conference in paris where he met with president 
francois mitterrand before coming to london dont hold it 
against us if we continue to furnish arms for a little while to 
democratic governments 
havel met with business people and business organizations 
thursday exploring possible areas for economic cooperation 
he arrived wednesday to a redcarpet welcome and luncheon at 
buckingham palace with queen elizabeth ii then had talks with 
prime minister margaret thatcher at her 10 downing st office and 
residence 
he said they discussed the future of europe and german 
unification 
i told her that the process of unification should be 
understood as a sort of engine propelling the unification of the 
whole of europe he told reporters 
havel returns to prague on friday

president fw de klerks 
attempts to abolish apartheid in south africa can be compared to 
the reform efforts of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev a 
senior us official said thursday 
there are some parallels he told reporters traveling with 
us secretary of state james a baker iii who met with de klerk 
for more than an hour thursday in the first such highlevel 
encounter in 12 years 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
president nelson mandela of the african national congress and other 
leading black nationalists told him de klerk is a man of 
integrity and so far his word has been good 
baker had not believed de klerks government 13 months ago 
when it said it was going to run on a program of abolishing 
apartheid the official said he said baker now believes these 
people are quite serious and that they are committed to an 
irreversible process and that they are anxious to move quickly 
baker told de klerk during a 75minute meeting that what he 
had done so far was courageous in light of the obvious political 
pressures and restraints he is subject to the official said 
a second us official said skeptics should recall that 
gorbachevs sincerity and ability to make radical changes also were 
questioned when he first came to power in 1985 
the praise marks the latest in a series of diplomatic successes 
this week for a government that has been isolated by most nations 
for more than a decade british foreign secretary douglas hurd met 
de klerk on monday and invited him to visit britain in may for a 
meeting with prime minister margaret thatcher president bush has 
invited de klerk to washington 
on wednesday de klerk held an unprecedented meeting with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in namibia where they 
attended independence ceremonies for the territory formerly ruled 
by south africa 
after meeting baker on thursday afternoon the south african 
president met with president siad barre of somalia 
governmentcontrolled television reported without fanfare a visit 
by an african head of state to south africa would have been treated 
as a major event a few months ago 
foreign minister pik botha said no south african head of state 
had been in such demand since jan smuts at the end of world war ii 
baker met de klerk despite opposition from mandela and other 
leaders in the fight against south africas racial segregation 
policy flanked by de klerk and botha on the steps of the 
presidents official residence baker said de klerk told me we 
are engaged here in south africa in an irreversible process and we 
will follow it to its logical conclusion 
de klerk was asked whether blacks would be granted equal voting 
rights and a black could become president in his lifetime 
i have just won an election asking for a mandate to attain 
exactly that he replied we are working toward that yes 
where all south africans will have a vote where that vote will be 
of equal value with proper protection of minority rights so 
there wont be domination built into the system not minority 
domination but also not simple majority domination 
baker arrived thursday from namibia and met a delegation of 11 
antiapartheid leaders at the us ambassadors cape town residence 
before seeing de klerk 
the anc members repeated mandelas criticism of the baker visit 
saying it would give the world the impression fundamental progress 
had been made in moving toward a nonracial democracy but no 
demonstrations against the visit occurred and the activists 
laughed and smiled as they walked out of the meeting mandela 
cautioned reporters wednesday after meeting baker in windhoek the 
namibian capital to concentrate on areas of agreement between 
black nationalists and the united states 
baker repeatedly said he did not believe the dispute over the 
meeting would cloud future negotiations or the us governments 
standing with antiapartheid groups 
the secretary said he told de klerk that lifting the state of 
emergency which gives police wide powers to restrict protests and 
detain people would be an important symbol that the reform process 
was moving forward 
botha said the government wants to end the emergency as soon as 
possible but a recent upsurge of violence was holding up its 
cancellation more than 300 people have died since mandela was 
released from prison last month 
thursdays meeting with de klerk included talks on angola de 
klerk told reporters baker is to meet soon in kinshasa zaire with 
president mobutu sese seko and angolan guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi in a bid to arrange a new ceasefire in the 15yearold war 
across namibias northern border 
baker has expressed hope that new flexibility on the part of 
angolan president jose eduardo dos santos may speed implementation 
of a ceasefire but it appeared unlikely a truce could be arranged 
before the secretary returns to washington on saturday evening

more than 400 ethnic albanian 
teenagers were hospitalized thursday in podujevo a town in 
restive kosovo province after being felled by a mysterious illness 
that officials said may be poison 
official radio belgrade said about 4000 ethnic albanians 
gathered in the streets of podujevo upon hearing the news some of 
them beat up 15 serbs and montenegrins accusing them of poisoning 
classrooms of albanian pupils 
professor aljus gasi the dean of pristina university said he 
was informed that 417 schoolchildren were taken to hospitals 
mostly in pristina the capital of the ethnically divided province 
gasi said doctors who examined the most serious cases reported 
such symptoms as reddened eyes and breathing problems 
an anticipated official statement from authorities was never 
released thursday 
radio belgrade said angry albanians broke into the local town 
council shattering windows and rampaging through offices 
police moved in thursday to head off an open nationalist 
conflict in the streets of podujevo considered a center of 
albanian protest in the past 
the state news agency tanjug said authorities denied rumors that 
drinking water had also been poisoned in the province where 85 
percent of the population are ethnic albanians 
it said the provincial government was in session but had not 
issued a statement to explain the suspected poisoning 
a medical team from belgrade was on its way to kosovo to take 
blood and other samples for laboratory tests to be made back in 
belgrade it added 
my daughter who goes to school in pristina phoned me to say 
her school was closed thursday after pupils complained about signs 
of poisoning one woman told the associated press she refused to 
give her name 
a teacher in podujevo agron jaha said she saw people 
dropping on the floor en masse 
students were reported hospitalized in pristina in addition to 
podujevo symptoms included nausea coughing and tearing eyes 
usually ascribed to the effects of tear gas 
tanjug and a health worker reported earlier that more than 200 
people were hospitalized in pristina most of the patients were 
said to be in fair condition 
the provincial premier jusuf zeinulahu told reporters none of 
the people hospitalized was dangerously ill 
a crowd of worried parents gathered in front of the kosovo 
government building in pristina on thursday 
ethnic unrest in kosovo has killed at least 60 people the last 
two years the unrest centers on a dispute between ethnic 
albanians who form 90 percent of the population and the minority 
serbs and montenegrins 
the republic of serbia passed constitutional changes last year 
to retain greater control over kosovo saying this was needed to 
protect the rights of the minorities 
opposition sources alleged that chemicals were sprinkled on the 
floors of classrooms of ethnic albanian children or sprayed into 
the air 
veton suroi an opposition leader told reporters in pristina 
the situation was alarming he claimed that more than 1000 
people mostly children had been hospitalized in pristina alone 
zekerija cana another opposition spokesman demanded a federal 
commission be set up to investigate the circumstances of the mass 
poisoning by an unknown chemical 
they said the alleged poisoning had begun three days ago

in a move that could speed formation of east 
germanys first noncommunist government the social democrats 
agreed thursday to discuss joining a coalition government with an 
alliance that won national elections 
the leftleaning party which finished second in sundays 
balloting to the alliance for germany refused to work with a 
rightwing party in the threeparty alliance alliance leaders left 
the door open to such an arrangement 
as the political jockeying continued the parliaments future 
was clouded by concerns that many newly elected lawmakers may have 
helped the hated former secret police stasi those under suspicion 
include the man expected to be named as prime minister lothar de 
maiziere chief of the christian democrats 
he denied on thursday ever having been a secret police 
collaborator 
the official supervising the dismantling of the secret police 
werner fischer said wednesday that many of the new deputies may 
have had clandestine police links 
manfred stolpe a respected figure in east germany and chief 
administator of the lutheran churchs berlin district urged that 
all parties agree to an investigation into the 400 newly elected 
lawmakers past 
he raised the possibility such a probe could lead to new 
elections saying i can imagine that such a decision could 
become necessary as a last resort 
fischer on thursday cited continuing suspicions that de maiziere 
collaborated 
there are indications there is no proof he told west 
germanys zdf television 
he said he had received allegations against de maiziere from 
citizens groups sifting through secret police files in east german 
cities asked on television whether he took these allegations 
seriously fischer said very 
on thursday de maiziere denied a west german newspaper report 
which cited an anonymous tip to prodemocracy groups as saying de 
maiziere was a collaborator with honeckers secret police 
de maiziere said he only had contacts with them on behalf of 
dissidents he defended when he was practicing law 
berlin bishop gottfried forck warned against rash accusations in 
trying to uncover suspected stasi collaborators in an interview 
he said he believed de maizieres denial 
the communists used the stasi to control all walks of life and 
many people were intidimated into collaborating until the 
caretaker government began dissolving it this year the stasi had 
85000 agents and hundreds of thousands of informers 
the social democrats decision thursday was vital because a 
twothirds majority in the new parliament is needed to approve 
unification with west germany and the alliance needs the votes of 
the social democrats to achieve that majority 
the social democrats favor a more gradual path toward 
unification with west germany than the alliance and earlier in the 
week it rejected an invitation to discuss forming a broad coalition 
but on thursday the party said it decided to hold exploratory 
talks in view of the serious problems of our country 
the nations governability has to have priority richard 
schroeder a social democratic member in parliament told a news 
conference party officials said meetings with the alliance would 
not begin before monday 
the christian democratic union is the largest party in the 
alliance it won 164 seats in the 400member parliament the social 
democrats have 87 and together the two parties would have an 
absolute majority 
east germanys communistled caretaker government formally 
remains in power until the new democratically elected cabinet is 
formed before that happens west germany will not resume talks on 
unity 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who heavily backs the 
christian democratic union is pressing for a broad coalition in 
east germany to ensure a clear mandate for moves toward unification 
the social democrats ruled out talks with the german social 
union the most rightist member of the alliance of germany 
that obstacle appeared to wane somewhat after de maiziere and 
other alliance leaders met kohl late wednesday in bonn 
the east german leaders said their parties will not form a 
common bloc of deputies this was seen as a formula that would 
allow the social democrats to join in a coalition without formally 
having to cooperate with the german social union 
the daily number of east germans resettling in west germany has 
dropped in half the past week apparently as a result of national 
elections the west german interior ministry said thursday 
it said 931 east german resettlers registered with federal 
authorities on wednesday compared with 2248 one week ago 
the exodus sparked the fall prodemocracy revolution that ousted 
the hardline communist regime of erich honecker and led to the 
election east germanys first free vote

a greyhound lines negotiator will meet with a 
federal mediator in washington on friday as new incidents of 
violence were reported in the 3weekold nationwide bus drivers 
strike 
company spokesman george gravley said thursday that the mediator 
in the stalled contract talks called greyhounds chief negotiator 
anthony p lanney to washington no new talks are scheduled 
between management and union 
federal mediators are trying to reopen negotiations or to 
arrange shuttle diplomacy between the sides said jim power 
spokesman for the federal mediation and conciliation service 
renewed violence is certainly giving the effort a little more 
pressure powers said 
it doesnt provide a sound basis for getting together they 
need some level ground to work on violence is always 
counterproductive he said 
jeff nelson a spokesman for the amalgmated council of greyhound 
local unions said he had no knowledge of discussions between union 
officials and federal mediators 
but nelson called the meeting between the company and the 
mediator a first step maybe theyll find it in their hearts to 
talk to their employees soon 
we are absolutely ready to meet at any time he added 
the meeting comes against a backdrop of more violence aimed at 
greyhound buses including the first in texas that happened 
overnight wednesday when a bullet was fired at a bus carrying 30 
people in san antonio 
the bullet struck but did not penetrate a service door on an 
entrance ramp to interstate 35 no one was injured and the bus 
continued on to dallas travis county sheriffs officials said 
it did not penetrate the second window of the double window 
sheriffs lt george meek said it left a hole in one pane but not 
the second because it contains thick insulated plastic 
a second dallasbound bus from new orleans was struck in its 
rear air filter by a bullet thursday afternoon 15 miles east of 
lake charles la on interstate 10 company spokeswoman jean fry 
said no passengers were aboard she said the driver heard a loud 
sound and drove to the lake charles terminal ms fry said 
early thursday there were two shootings reported near st 
louis in the first a bus from st louis to memphis was hit by 
three bullets that struck the windshield and the front grill 
police said the incident occurred on interstate 55 about a mile 
south of the st louis city limits 
the second shooting about 235 am occurred in illinois about 
five miles east of st louis and involved a bus that was en route 
from chicago to st louis 
in both cases the shots seemed to come from a passing car 
no one was injured in the shootings police said but in las 
vegas police said an elderly passenger was slightly injured by 
flying glass wednesday when a greyhound bus en route to los angeles 
was pelted by rocks on interstate 15 west of the las vegas strip 
on wednesday 
the shootings bring the total to 20 since the strike began march 
2 according to a greyhound accounting released thursday the 
report added in the three latest shootings in addition to three 
earlier incidents that greyhound said hadnt been reported earlier 
union leaders have said they have no reponsibility for the 
shootings they released their own list thursday saying 55 pickets 
have been injured over the three weeks by being struck by buses 
hit by security guards or in other incidents 
one striker was killed the second day of the strike when he was 
hit while on a picket line by a bus drive by a replacement driver 
no charges have been filed 
gravley said the violence pushes greyhound away from reopening 
talks which the company halted sunday in tucson ariz its 
impossible to reach an agreement while this violence and terrorism 
is going on gravley said thursday 
nelson the union spokesman said his organization issued 
letters wednesday afternoon asking members to refrain from violence 
whoever has committed these crimes should know that the union 
will support prosecution to the fullest extent of the law nelson 
said these are extremely unfortunate incidents 
nelson said the idea that violent acts have tacit approval from 
union leaders is absolutely ridiculous

a prosecutor in the fraud trial of imelda marcos 
complained to the judge thursday that interviews given by her 
attorney to reporters could jeopardize the governments case 
the fair administration of justice is threatened by defense 
tactics that run afoul of the criminal rules as is the 
governments right to a fair trial assistant us attorney debra 
livingston said in a letter to us district judge john f keenan 
the interviews livingston referred to were excerpts from an nbc 
today show broadcast tuesday and comments made to several 
newspapers before the trial started 
livingston gave keenan the letter during a break in jury 
selection now in its third day and the judge took it under 
advisement by the end of the day thursday keenan had selected 31 
potential jurors a final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is 
expected to be chosen next week 
the letter said gerry spence one of the former philippine first 
ladys four attorneys violated a local rule that prohibits lawyers 
from commenting on pending criminal cases except to deny the 
charges or to quote from documents filed with the court 
later in the day thursday keenan jokingly brought up the issue 
youre not going to be on 60 minutes again he asked spence 
who was profiled on the cbs news show several years ago 
it depends on what youre going to do to me spence said 
livingston stopped short of requesting a gag order barring any 
discussion of the case she asked keenan to remind defense lawyers 
of their responsibility to abide by the rule 
spence had no immediate comment on the governments letter on 
wednesday he told keenan that he was concerned about negative 
publicity 
in this country and in this legal system one doesnt become a 
criminal by sleeping with ones husband spence was quoted as 
saying on nbc the ghost of ferdinand marcos is everywhere 
everywhere in this case 
mrs marcos 60 is charged in the alleged illegal transfer of 
more than 160 million from the philippine government and 
defrauding banking institutions of an additional 165 million her 
husband former philippine president was named in the original 
october 1988 indictment but died in hawaii last sept 28

the state airline malev asked aeroflot 
the soviet air carrier on thursday to stop flying jewish emigres 
to hungary the mti news agency reported 
the request followed malevs decision wednesday to suspend 
flights of soviet jews to israel via budapest because of a 
terrorist threat 
the proiranian group islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine issued the threat this month in lebanon saying all 
airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines their 
jetliners and offices will be direct targets for us 
this is a warning and a threat said the group which holds 
western hostages in lebanon 
many arab governments have opposed the emigration of soviet jews 
to israel on the grounds some of them might settle in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the 
territories which it captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
middle east war 
in new york the american jewish committee asked hungary to 
reverse the airlines decision in a statement thursday the 
committee said only 1 percent of arriving soviet jews had settled 
in the occupied lands 
the group said such arguments only serve as smokescreens for 
a longstanding and much larger arab aim to prevent largescale 
jewish immigration to any part of israel 
budapests ferihegy aiport which tightened security to 
unprecedented levels in response to the threat is a transit point 
for many soviet jews traveling from moscow there are no direct 
flights from the soviet union to israel malev began flying to 
israel last year in the wake of renewed diplomatic ties 
despite suspension of charter flights for the soviet emigrants 
the official mti news agency said tourist flights would continue

president corazon aquino on thursday 
dismissed an offer by former first lady imelda marcos to return 
wealth left by her late husband saying it was a ruse to escape 
trial on us racketeering charges 
i am not convinced of the seriousness nor of the sincerity 
behind this reported latest proposal of mrs marcos coming as it 
does at the start of the trial in new york mrs aquino said in 
a statement to reporters 
the filipino people want the money that marcos stole returned 
to them directly and without onerous conditions 
mrs marcos went on trial tuesday in new york charged with 
illegally diverting 160 million to buy property in manhattan and 
defrauding banking institutions of an additional 165 million to 
finance the deal her husband former president ferdinand marcos of 
the philippines was named in the original october 1988 indictment 
but he died in hawaii on sept 28 
in new york the philippine government released the text of a 
letter wednesday from mrs marcos to president bush offering to 
turn over money to a fivemember international panel which would 
oversee its transfer to the filipino people 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed that bush 
received a letter from mrs marcos but gave no details of the 
amount of money involved he said the president could not respond 
during the trial 
in manila solicitor general francisco chavez also dismissed 
mrs marcos letter as a maneuver by her attorneys 
it seems to be part of the strategy adapted by her lawyer to 
picture her as a poor suffering widow who did not know what her 
husband did when he was alive chavez said 
but all of us know this is ludicrous this is preposterous 
because our records show that she was very well within the circle 
that decided the fate of this country during that time 
in a related development emmanuel pelaez the philippine 
ambassador to washington denied that the issue of us bases in 
the philippines played any part in mrs marcos trial 
the united states has never attempted to use the marcos 
prosecution to influence the philippines on the bases question nor 
has the philippines ever interfered with or tried to influence the 
prosecution of the marcoses under us laws pelaez said in a 
statement released in manila 
the united states maintains clark air base subic bay naval base 
and four smaller facilities under the agreement that expires next 
year preliminary negotiations for an extension of the bases are 
set to begin by the middle of next month 
marcos supporters claim the united states is prosecuting mrs 
marcos to win favor with the aquino government so that it will 
agree to allow the bases to remain

prime minister margaret thatchers candidate was 
trounced friday in a byelection in central england losing the 
conservative party stronghold to an opposition socialist by a 
surprisingly wide margin 
the result marked the conservatives worst rout in a special 
parlimantary election in 50 years and was likely to fuel 
speculation that the tories might try to dump mrs thatcher as 
leader this fall 
the labor party captured the prosperous midstaffordshire 
district with a 9449vote majority overturning a majority of more 
than 14000 votes held by the previous conservative party 
legislator 
the result declared early friday reflected anger among voters 
at soaring 15 percent interest rates that have hiked the cost of 
home loans and an unpopular new local government tax 
labor candidate sylvia heal a social worker took 49 percent of 
the vote way ahead of the 33 percent for the conservative 
contender accountant charles prior the centrist social and 
liberal democratic partys tim jones trailed with 11 percent 
television networks earlier reported two exit polls conducted by 
harris and national opinion poll as showing a large swing of more 
than 20 percent from the government to labor something 
conservative party chairman kenneth baker called disappointing 
clearly we are going through a period of unpopularity i think 
it will be temporary baker said the labor party is tonight 
the passive beneficiary of the protest vote 
people are absolutely fed up with mrs thatcher declared 
labor party spokesman jack cunningham she is out of touch she 
doesnt seem to understand their problems and she doesnt seem 
to care 
underlining the bad news for the tories a british broadcasting 
corp survey thursday night of the four most recent opinion polls 
across the country showed labor averaging a 21point lead 
nationally this was labors biggest lead since mrs thatcher won a 
third successive term in 1987 
a year ago the tories had a 10point lead nationally 
from midstaffordshire pollsters reported an underlying 
antipathy toward mrs thatcher personally among many of the people 
questioned right after they voted in the prosperous semirural 
district 
harris reported that 84 percent of defecting conservatives said 
mrs thatcher should resign before the next general election which 
must be held by mid1992 among defectors questioned by the 
national opinion poll 38 percent said she should quit 
harris exit poll for independent television news at the 10 pm 
close of voting showed labor winning 50 percent of the vote with 
the conservatives getting 32 percent and the centrist social and 
liberal democratic party 11 percent itn said harris questioned 
2369 people 
the national opinion poll of nearly 2300 voters for the bbc 
showed labor with 51 percent the conservatives 32 percent and the 
centrists 10 percent the margin of error was 3 percent 
the polls showed the remainder of the vote scattered among the 
greens a centrist splinter group the social democratic party and 
nine fringe candidates 
the election seat became vacant by the suicide in december of 
the conservative politician who took 50 percent of the vote to win 
with a 14654vote majority in the 1987 general election 
thatcher aides argued that byelections traditionally attract 
large protest votes 
however the vote was likely to be regarded as a barometer of 
her chances of winning the next general election and a trouncing 
would renew speculation of a possible attempt to dump her as party 
leader this fall 
midstaffordshire runs from the affluent cathedral town of 
lichfield birthplace of the 18th century poet and dictionary 
compiler samuel johnson through an industrial town rugeley 
the voters include a high proportion of skilled bluecollar 
workers who voted tory through the 80s followed mrs thatchers 
exhortations to buy their own homes and are now hardhit by high 
home loan rates 
interest rates have doubled in under two years in an attempt to 
curb inflation now running at 77 percent and rising 
in addition midstaffordshire voted while theres a national 
furor over the new perhead tax dubbed the poll tax that next 
month replaces property taxes under a reform of local government 
financing 
the tax which mrs thatcher says is fairer because everyone 
pays is averaging 580 a year and means most families pay about 
onethird more 
the election had no effect on mrs thatchers overwhelming 
control of the 650member house of commons where she has a 
101seat majority going into the vote the conservatives had 374 
seats compared with labors 228 and the social and liberal 
democrats 19 the remainder are held by minority parties

a young man reached out as if to welcome 
a presidential candidate thursday and shot him to death with a 
submachine gun hidden in a newspaper police said a notorious drug 
lord ordered the assassination 
colombias intellegence police chief gen miguel maza marquez 
said an investigation had determined that the leader of the 
medellin drug cartel pablo escobar ordered the assassination of 
bernardo jaramillo of the leftist patriotic union party 
an official communique from the national security council said 
the police had intercepted radio communications between escobar and 
one of his subordinates implicating the drug boss in the killing 
early thursday at bogotas el dorado international airport 
earlier thursday a telephone caller claimed the attack for the 
medellin cartel 
bodyguards with jaramillo shot and wounded the gunman before he 
was captured at least two other people were reported wounded 
a man walked up to him to greet him like a supporter and then 
began shooting one of the bodyguards told caracol radio which 
also reported maza marquezs statement bernardo fell to the 
floor and was protected by his wife and bodyguards while we fired 
on the aggressor 
maza marquez said escobars order was confirmed by the gunman 
during interrogations the gunman said he was paid 625 to kill 
jaramillo 
the police chief who has been targeted by the cartel in two 
bombings said the assassin was a 16yearold boy who carried false 
identification papers police earlier said the assailant was a 
21yearold 
the gunman fired on jaramillo after the candidate and his wife 
arrived at the airport thursday morning for an avianca flight to 
the tourist city of santa marta on colombias north coast 
officials said 
jaramillo was hit four times twice in the throat and twice in 
the abdomen and died later at a hospital officials said 
caracols bogota station received a telephone call from a man 
who said the medellin cocaine cartel had slain the 38yearold 
candidate who was to run in the may 27 election 
the caller said four gunmen were involved and that three escaped 
he said another presidential candidate cesar gaviria of the 
liberal party would be assassinated next maza marquez said the 
captured gunman told police other politicians were on the drug 
cartels hit list 
drug traffickers in august killed another presidential hopeful 
luis carlos galan of the governing liberal party that killing 
sparked a government crackdown on drug lords and the extradition of 
14 drug suspects to the united states 
late thursday president virgilio barco said in a letter to 
patriotic union president diego montana that in light of the new 
offensive by the violent ones the party should join the 
countrys efforts to defend democracy 
on jan 18 the medellin cartel said in a communique that the 
government had won its war with the cartel and appealed for an end 
to extraditing suspects to the united states 
the caller thursday said it was renewing the war because barco 
would not accept an offer for the traffickers to give themselves up 
to be tried in colombian courts 
rightwing death squads also have been blamed for previous 
slayings of patriotic union members authorities say some of them 
are be run by drug traffickers the patriotic union though has 
claimed that colombias army and police are involved in the death 
squads 
the government permitted the communist party and former 
guerrillas to organize the patriotic union in 1984 to persuade 
rebel groups to end three decades of violence 
the party on thursday said interior minister carlos lemos 
simmonds had caused the latest killing with a statement last week 
and it called for him to resign 
lemos had accused the patriotic union of acting as the political 
arm of the countrys largest guerrilla group the colombian 
revolutionary armed forces 
a submachine gun attack by four men in the bogota airports main 
terminal on march 3 1989 killed a member of the executive 
committee of the patriotic union and wounded a liberal party 
presidential candidate ernesto samper 
americas watch a human rights group based in new york said 
thursday that such attacks in the past had been mounted by both 
drug groups and paramilitary organizations supported by army 
officers 
mr jaramillos murder highlights the fact that the targetting 
of the patriotic union and other leftist organizations has nver 
stopped in colombia even though international attention continues 
to be focused on the violent acts of the drug cartels against 
public officials said juan mendez americas watch executive 
director 
as word spread of jaramillos death disturbances flared in 
downtown bogota people burned a bus and shattered windows of a few 
stores the patriotic union called for a national strike 
the body of jaramillo was taken to the national capitol building 
while police reported several battles between people throwing rocks 
and security forces firing tear gas in the streets of bogota 
an official communique said one police officer was shot and 
wounded by one protester before riot police restored order 
at the state department in washington deputy spokesman richard 
boucher said the killing is yet another outrageous assault 
against the democratic aspirations of the colombian people and we 
condemn those who would attempt to force political change through 
violent acts such as this 
jaramillo was the 1044th member of the patriotic union party to 
be killed in the last six years he resigned as president of the 
patriotic union in february 1989 and fled the country citing death 
threats but returned six weeks later 
drug traffickers have killed more than 200 people in bombings 
and other attacks since the barco government began cracking down on 
drug lords after galans slaying

women guerrillas of the tamil 
tigers cyanide capsules around their necks and assault rifles 
ready have moved out of the jungles and into the towns since 
indian peacekeeping troops went home 
the emergence of the tiger women who were talked about often 
but seldom seen is jolting society in the jaffna peninsula of 
northern sri lanka where the tamil minority predominates 
violence has been a way of life here since the revolt by tamil 
separatists began in 1983 but warfare was considered mens work 
our social fabric and lifestyle have been completely 
destroyed said velupillai kanapathipillai a tamil 
schoolteacher it will never be the same after seeing these young 
girls carrying guns 
kanapathipillai was echoing traditional beliefs that tamil women 
should be demure 
lt imelda a 26yearold commander of the female tigers of 
tamil eelam has little time for that she and the other women in 
her outfit can handle t81 chinese assault rifles and machine 
pistols rocket launchers and antiaircraft guns she said 
stanley dominic district leader of the male tigers spoke with 
pride of the women 
they do everything we do he told an interviewer in jaffna 
they man checkpoints 24 hours they drive heavy trucks captured 
from the indian army they take part in active combat and they are 
willing to bite their cyanide capsules to avoid being captured 
the tigers say more than 300 of their men have used cyanide to 
commit suicide rather than submit to capture and interrogation 
imelda said she did not know how many women tigers had used their 
capsules 
about 25 tiger women in camouflage gear guarded her twostory 
headquarters during a recent visit the women are segregated from 
the male liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest guerrilla 
force which has fought both the sri lankan army and indian 
peacekeeping troops 
no men were in sight at the headquarters and a male visitor was 
eyed with suspicion 
imelda who uses a code name like many male tigers said 26 
women guerrillas died in facetoface combat with male indian 
soldiers in two years 
she denied periodic speculation that the female tigers were 
created to fight indian paramilitary policewomen who served in sri 
lanka along with the allmale indian army 
no indian woman soldier can fight me imelda said eyes 
blazing they are powder puffs i challenge them 
neither male nor female tigers will give the total strength of 
the guerrillas who seek a separate homeland in northeastern sri 
lanka to be called tamil eelam the militants claim discrimination 
by sri lankas ethnic sinhalese majority 
sinhalese 75 percent of the 16 million people control the 
government and army of this island off the tip of india tamils 
make up 18 percent of the population 
more than 11000 people have been killed in the 7yearold 
ethnic war 
in 1989 the tamil tigers began negotations with the sri lankan 
government on a peaceful solution as indian troops withdrew the 
tigers took over positions and whole towns once patrolled by the 
peacekeepers with no serious opposition from the sri lankan 
military 
male guerrillas patrol jaffna town but many residents speak 
with awe of the female tigers who occasionally are seen in the 
town and nearby villages 
imelda said the women tigers like their male counterparts have 
a strict code of conduct 
we are not permitted to have boyfriends wear makeup or 
jewelry not even powder our faces she said 
one of her fighters 20yearold valarmathy said women have 
been in the forefront of the liberation struggle all over the 
world we are no exception 
like imelda valarmathy would not say when she joined the tigers 
or what she did before

anniversaries always are big deals in tv but 
dont expect a gala edition of abcs nightline tonight to note 
that it will be 10 years old on saturday 
in fact dont even expect ted koppel to anchor it tonight 
as a matter of fact im taking the day off says koppel 
the shows anchor ever since it premiered as a 20minute 
mondaythroughthursday latenight news interview program on march 
24 1980 
the celebration of a decade will occur in late april with a 
primetime edition of nightline featuring suitable highlights 
of its existence 
the shows honors include two peabody awards and general acclaim 
for koppels crisp tothepoint interviews of a wide variety of 
guests world leaders sports executives diplomats aids victims 
arabs and israelis together generals and even gary hart a 
twotime visitor 
but his mostwatched show concerned what some might call light 
entertainment a chat with the sincefallen tv preacher jim bakker 
and his wife tammy in may 1987 it got a 41 percent share of the 
audience and viewers in more than 123 million homes tuned in 
true more cosmic matters tend to draw smaller audiences the 
show averages 5 million to 6 million homes each night abc says 
sometimes its even lower only about 39 million homes in the 
week ending march 9 
but nightline the brainchild of abc news president roone 
arledge has proved there is room in latenight tv for news 
interviews as an alternative to amusements and it can get ratings 
even on those nights johnny carson fills in for his guest hosts 
its the only show of its kind that time at night its 
really the only show of its kind in commercial television says 
koppel whose program among other things has held six worldclass 
town meetings 
the most recent one set against the backdrop of the freeing of 
black leader nelson mandela took place last month in south africa 
what has become nightline began on nov 8 1979 with a 
different title and as a singlesubject effort anchored by the late 
frank reynolds aired four days after 65 americans were seized at 
the us embassy in tehran the show was called the iran crisis 
america held hostage 
a week later through arledges efforts abc began america 
held hostage a latenight series on the crisis the show 
initially was anchored by reynolds then peter jennings and finally 
koppel 
koppel with abc news for 27 of his 50 years became permanent 
anchor of the series two weeks after it began staying at the helm 
as nightline premiered and evolved into its halfhour 
fivenight format 
the anchorman who now gets monday nights off became famous and 
wealthy and in an unusual arrangement nearly three years ago he 
also got a new contract under which his own production company 
makes four primetime abc specials a year which he then can sell 
overseas 
although he and nightline generally have enjoyed critical 
huzzahs they have suffered a few shots too notably from a media 
watchdog group fairness and accuracy in reporting 
fair citing its analysis of nightline shows from 1985 to 
1988 complained about what it said was the shows preponderance of 
white male guests from government corporations and the military 
the larger question here is their perception and analysis 
that we had a great many white male conservatives on the program 
koppel says 
well if you look at the 10 years that nightline has been on 
the air during those years ronald reagan was president george 
bush was president and the policymakers and decisionmakers the 
people they put into power tend to be white male conservatives 
koppel whose current abc contract ends in december estimates 
he and his nightline staff work about 13 hours a day on each 
show and a 15hour day isnt all that unusual 
but he has no ambitions he says to anchor a network newscast 
id rather do what i do now he says 
nor would he like to shift from what is showtime for him 
1130 pm est to a primetime news series such a series would 
give abc three it already has the veteran 2020 and fledgling 
primetime live 
but there would be no joy in weekly prime time for koppel 
i just dont think that a nightlinelike program would make 
it in prime time he says we would undoubtedly get more 
viewers than we get right now at 1130 at night but i dont think 
wed get enough more to make it a successful primetime program

to prosecutors and the families of his 
victims robert alton harris is a vicious murderer who laughed 
about killing two teenagers and told one to quit crying and die 
like a man 
to his lawyers and closest friend he is the product of a 
violently abusive childhood who during a decade on death row has 
grown into a stable caring remorseful man 
harris has become a symbol of the publics anger over violent 
crime and legal delays in carrying out the states death penalty 
law but april 3 barring a lastminute stay he will become the 
first person executed in california since 1967 
harris 37 was convicted of abducting and killing two 
16yearold san diego boys 12 years ago to get their car for a bank 
robbery that netted 3000 
it seems to me if anybody deserves the death penalty it is 
harris said san diego county superior court judge michael 
wellington who as a state deputy attorney general fought most of 
harris appeals over the past decade 
two murders a pair of kidnappings a bank robbery by someone 
who was six months out on parole from a previous homicide the 
crime is horrible inexcusable wellington said 
michael kroll a writer and death penalty opponent who 
befriended harris agrees the crimes are horrendous 
but he insists the man he has visited weekly for the past eight 
years is not the coldblooded monster drawn by prosecutors and 
should be spared the trip to san quentins gas chamber 
harris has admitted shooting the boys but said he does not know 
why 
on july 5 1978 he and his 18yearold brother danny planned 
to rob a branch of the san diego trust and savings bank but needed 
a getaway car 
harris spotted a green ford in a parking lot john mayeski and 
his friend michael baker sat inside eating hamburgers from a 
nearby fastfood restaurant 
harris pulled out a 9mm luger climbed into the ford and ordered 
john to drive to a deserted spot danny harris who followed in the 
brothers car later testified that harris told the boys he would 
not hurt them and ordered them to walk up a fire trail 
but harris shot john in the back and the head then ran after 
michael who fled and hid behind a rock danny said when harris 
caught up with him the boy screamed prayed and pleaded for his 
life 
quit crying and die like a man harris later boasted of 
telling the teenager a cellmate testified god cant help you 
now boy youre going to die 
harris shot michael four times then shot john again in the head 
at his girlfriends apartment he laughed about the shootings 
and ate the boys unfinished meals danny said 
among the officers who arrested harris a short time later was 
steven baker michaels father baker who learned only later his 
son was dead has waited more than a decade to watch harris 
execution 
they were good boys doing well in school they didnt have 
any problems and on that particular day they were going fishing 
baker said and harris just executed those boys 
in exchange for testifying against his brother danny harris was 
not charged with murder but served 3 years for robbery 
harris was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in early 
1979 but three previous execution dates were dissolved during the 
appeals process 
its just an open sore that never seems to heal baker said 
of the delays 
in january the us supreme court in its fourth consideration 
of the case refused to hear harris appeal on feb 5 a san diego 
judge issued a death warrant setting the april 3 execution date 
on march 16 the state supreme court refused to overturn the 
death sentence or stay the execution harris lawyers said they 
would file another appeal monday in federal court in san diego but 
there are few legal issues left to argue 
last week harris withdrew his request for clemency from gov 
george deukmejian saying he did not think it would get fair 
consideration deukmejian a former state attorney general 
advocates capital punishment and wrote californias current death 
penalty law 
harris attorneys argue his rights were violated and claim his 
progress in prison disproves a prosecution psychiatrists testimony 
depicting him as a sociopath incapable of remorse or 
rehabilitation 
they also have submitted statements from some of the 273 other 
death row inmates praising harris as wellliked decent helpful 
and generous 
unlike most men here weve seen the changes robert harris has 
gone through weve also seen something you wont see on many faces 
here remorse wrote inmate james a melton 
the supreme court petition also offered newly discovered 
evidence of mental disorders stemming from childhood abuse 
harris the fifth of nine children was born in south carolina 
more than two months prematurely when his father kicked his 
alcoholic mother claiming she was carrying another mans child 
he was beaten daily and dropped on his head several times as a 
young child a sister said in court documents that their father 
often threatened them loading his weapons and warning you have 
only 30 minutes to hide 
when harris was 13 after the family had moved to california and 
broken up his mother abandoned him as they picked fruit near 
modesto 
two years later he was arrested in florida for stealing a car 
and spent 4 years in prison then settled in southern californias 
imperial valley and worked as a welder his former wife cheryl 
later testified he beat her and threaten to kill her if she told 
anyone 
at the time of the murders harris had been on parole for six 
months after spending almost 2 years in prison for manslaughter 
his background does not excuse his crimes but helps explain 
them and makes life in prison a more appropriate penalty kroll 
said 
if you treat a child in a way totally devoid of love totally 
violent you will get pathological violence at the other end 
however its manifested he said 
baker and prosecutors argue that harris past was known and 
considered at the proper time by the jury that recommended a 
death sentence 
i believe very strongly that you are responsible for your own 
actions baker said its become so easy and so common for 
people to blame other circumstances 
now baker waits for prosecutors to call him in san diego and 
tell him to buy a plane ticket for the execution 
i think ill feel relieved that the entire ordeal is finally 
over he said

it doesnt pay to mess with a good thing 
take the 1990 buick riviera save for some modifications of the 
instrument panel and more luxurious interior features the car is 
virtually unchanged from its 1989 reincarnation as one of americas 
cherished luxury coupes 
thank heavens in the 1986 model year when buick shrank the 
riv sales plunged from 55546 the previous year to 25835 by the 
1987 model year sales were down to 19838 then to 9241 in 1988 
the signals were clear americans wanted their riv big and 
luxurious 
the 1990 riviera is that and more in fact the riviera ranked 
as the top domestic car and no 2 among imports and domestic cars 
combined in a study by market researchers jd power and associates 
of agoura hills calif the study surveyed buyers of 1989 models 
about initial quality of their vehicles 
for anyone with warm memories of earlier rivieras the 1990 
model doesnt disappoint 
exterior styling retains the traditional riv look with the 
cutoff rear roofline followed by sweptback rear end its longer 
by 11 inches than the previous model 
its solid doors are heavy and close with a decided thud 
the interior of the test car exuded traditional luxury the wide 
front seats cradled the body as did the outer seat areas of the 
back seat leather an 895 option made the test car even more 
luxurious legroom in back was commendable 
three adults could be accommodated in the back seat and even 
the person in the middle had a cushioned resting spot i liked the 
handles that buick installed on the door pillars next to the small 
rear windows they made getting out a lot easier 
oddly the two front seats offered distinctly different 
perspectives on the drivers side the dashboard and instrument 
cluster jut out to put the radio and ventilation controls within 
easy reach and the instruments close for easy viewing 
the instruments by the way were rather jazzy lit up in green 
circles in an arrangement that seemed befitting an airplane 
cockpit this was a simpler design from last years riviera which 
had an electronic control console that some auto writers criticized 
as too complex 
on the passenger side however the dash and glovebox were 
pushed back against the windshield offering a roomy seating area 
that made it easy to cross and uncross legs 
the trunk was wide but had a slightly raised area in the center 
where the spare tire is located the 38liter fuelinjectd v6 
coupled with fourspeed automatic transmission with overdrive was 
nicely responsive and controlled 
suspension and handling were not as mushy as you might expect 
thanks in part to the optional gran touring package 104 that 
added stiffer than normal suspension and goodyear gt4 radial 
tires still the ride should appeal even to those looking for a 
soft ride the test car also had optional antilock brakes 925 
that worked well but kicked up quite a fuss on ice 
as expected in a luxury car the 1990 riviera has a host of 
standard features such as automatic climate control which includes 
air conditioning cruise control amfm stereo cassette and power 
steering and brakes 
i also appreciated the test cars 865 option package that added 
a keyless entry system this niftily lets you lock and unlock the 
doors unlock the trunk and turn on the interior lights from within 
10 feet of the car by pushing buttons on a control switch on the 
key chain it saves having to fumble with keys with an armload of 
groceries for instance the package also includes power seats a 
rearview mirror that automatically adjusts to headlight glare and 
a heated driverside mirror 
buick spokesman gary witzenburg said women account for 56 
percent of the primary riviera drivers and 41 percent of the 
purchase decisionmakers riviera buyers have median income of 
60000 to 65000 and an average age of 50 seventyone percent 
are married and 40 percent have college degrees he added 
with the reredesign of the riviera in autumn 1988 sales 
rebounded to 20000 in the 1989 model year and while buick does 
not make projections for specific models in the 1990 model year it 
does look for overall sales of all buick models to increase 6 
percent witzenburg said 
despite the high quality rating from jd power and associates 
for 1989 rivieras earlier models have not fared as well according 
to consumer reports magazine it ranked the smaller 198687 
riviera v6 models as much worse than average in owner reports of 
trouble 
there were no consumer reports listings for the redesigned 1988 
or 1989 models

a stones throw from the smelly smithfield meat 
market is an office building complex with no sign or anything to 
attract the attention of londoners hurrying by 
mounted cameras jumpy guards and heavy doors keep out the 
uninvited the goldcolored interior is hushed and luxuriously 
decorated 
this is the central selling organization londonbased marketing 
arm of the de beers diamond empire controlled by the wealthy 
oppenheimer family of south africa its experts sort mounds of 
rough diamonds constituting 80 percent of the worlds annual 
production 
but scratch the surface of this secretive world and the diamond 
business loses some sparkle 
sales have declined sharply and the 56yearold cartel is 
facing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to 
sell more of their own gems 
although its prosperity and control of the world diamond 
industry looks unchallengeable the pressures could loosen its grip 
and crimp its profits 
this year is going to be a critical one for de beers says 
diamond intelligence briefs a trade publication 
de beers south african interests face an uncertain future 
largely because of a newly energized political will by the black 
majority in that country an important diamond producer the 
african national congress has pledged to nationalize south africas 
major sources of wealth if it takes power 
apparently attempting to limit risk de beers recently announced 
it would split south african and foreign interests into two 
publicly held companies one based in switzerland 
after growth spurts of 19 percent in 1987 and 35 percent in 
1988 rough diamond sales fell 2 percent to 409 billion last year 
because of slowing economies high interest rates and the 
organizations two doubledigit price increases in 1988 and 1989 
the decline was sharpest in the second half of the year when 
sales fell 24 percent from the first six months 
there was a very definite noticeable slack in demand said 
analyst peter miller of yorkton securities inc in london 
the decline has limited de beers scope for raising prices this 
past week de beers announced it was increasing prices 55 percent 
compared to a 155 percent increase a year earlier 
the organization must this year renegotiate fiveyear contracts 
with botswana the second biggest diamond producer in terms of 
value and argyle diamonds of western australia the biggest 
producer in terms of quantity 
the government of newly independent namibia meanwhile is 
expected to demand a onefifth stake in consolidated diamond mines 
de beers namibian subsidiary 
the organization sells most of the soviet unions westbound 
diamonds but the soviets the biggest value producer have been 
acting more independently and squeezing the cartels margins the 
experts say 
jack lunzer managing director of idc ltd an independent 
diamond distributor in london said de beers undoubtedly will 
continue to control the major part of world production but its 
marketing arms profits will fall 
the effect hasnt been felt yet de beers profit rose 37 
percent to 11 billion in 1989 
few diamondproducing countries dare sell their output outside 
the organization and some bold enough to leave have returned 
because of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone 
zaire returned in 1983 after a twoyear split angola which 
broke in 1985 has been negotiating its reentry 
we are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have 
been for many years said tim capon the cartels director 
the organization buys rough diamonds from de beers own mines 
which represent 30 percent of world production and from producers 
in tanzania south africa zaire botswana namibia australia and 
the soviet union 
it reveals few details about security it was robbed once in 
the early 1980s when some diamonds were snatched as couriers 
carried them from one building to another 
de beers picks its 160 or so buying customers from thousands of 
hopefuls ten times a year at sales called sights the clients 
are offered a selection of diamonds chosen by the organization and 
placed in a simple cardboard box the buyer basically can take it 
or leave it 
the gems then go to cutters in the worlds major diamondcutting 
centers bombay india tel aviv israel antwerp belgium and new 
york 
of all diamonds mined only 15 percent will end up in jewelry 
but these represent 80 percent of the value of the worlds diamond 
production the rest are put to industrial use 
the organization is fighting the lackluster sales trend by 
trying to create new demand last year it spent 160 million on 
advertising and promotion trying for example to boost purchases 
of mens diamond jewelry 
de beerss achievement over the decades has been to massmarket 
what was once an aristocratic luxury without greatly diminishing 
its value today diamonds remain the gem of gems although 
millions of people own them 
de beers insists it seeks longterm stability and prosperity for 
the industry saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence 
in the value of diamonds 
so far it has succeeded while other commodities markets have 
suffered repeated convulsions rough diamond prices havent fallen 
since the organization started announcing price changes in 1964 
even its fiercest competitors laud de beers for putting up 
considerable amounts of money and assuming the risks to develop 
mines and support the market 
during the early 1980s when high interest rates caused the 
worst diamond slump since the 1930s the organization prevented the 
markets collapse by doubling its diamond stockpile to nearly 2 
billion worth 
but producers criticize the organizations secretiveness and 
what they call its arbitrary valuation system some want more of 
the industrys millions of jobs relocated in their own countries 
said lunzer its not unnatural for people in the producing 
countries to say are we getting a proper share of the value of 
our national resource after reviewing a complaint filed by the 
british mining company consolidated gold fields plc alleging 
anticompetitive practices britains office of fair trading 
decided in august against formally investigating whether the 
organization abuses its monopoly 
gold fields acknowledged the complaint was a defensive maneuver 
against a hostile and ultimately unsuccessful takeover bid from 
oppenheimercontrolled minorco sa last year 
formally known as de beers consolidated mines ltd and based in 
kimberley south africa the company was formed in 1888 by the 
british industrial colonialist cecil rhodes 
sir ernest oppenheimer a diamond merchant became chairman of 
de beers in 1929 and five years later formed diamond trading co 
the precursor of todays cartel 
oppenheimer who linked the diamond business with his extensive 
anglo american corp goldmining interests is credited with 
steering de beers through the depression he died in 1957 and was 
succeeded by his son harry oppenheimer who has made the company 
more internationally minded and therefore less vulnerable 
now 81 oppenheimer still serves on de beers board of 
directors of which he previously was chairman his 44yearold son 
and heir apparent nicholas is deputy to chairman julian ogilvie

a log cabin is the only place of 
jewish worship in this frozen region once called a promised land 
for soviet jews the makeshift rabbi boris kaufman conducts some 
services with the new testament 
he says he believes in jesus christ that makes him a christian 
not a jew but few would notice in the jewish autonomous region of 
the soviet union 
little is jewish but the name in this remote corner of the 
soviet far east set aside in 1934 
kaufman a 40yearold preacher with a red beard who settled on 
judaism after trying the baptist and pentecostal faiths said he 
got his job by default after the regions only rabbi died a few 
years aged 86 
everything fell apart after the rabbis death kaufman 
recalled he acknowledged having little knowledge of hebrew the 
language of the old testament and said he interprets jewish 
religious doctrine loosely 
during hanukkah the feast of lights when jews around the world 
lit ceremonial candles and recited holiday prayers there were no 
candles in the jewish autonomous region and no worshipers in the 
cabin snowcovered street banners bore only secular greetings for 
the new year 
the region has no real rabbi or other jewish clergy no 
religious education or kosher food no one can remember the last 
true jewish wedding or bar mitzvah the ritual that marks a boys 
13th birthday 
as a western writer put it decadesold hopes for the jewish 
autonomous region were blown away by the cold siberian wind 
after the 1917 bolshevik revolution the new leaders broke with 
the czarist policy of confining jews to a section of the southern 
and southwestern russian empire known as the pale 
they gave jews their own territory a sparsely populated tract 
between the bira and bidzhan rivers a region the size of belgium 
rich in forests tin deposits and such wildlife as the siberian 
ussuri tiger and wild boar 
most of the jewish autononomous region is farmland wooden huts 
dot the landscape outside the regional capital birobidzhan a town 
of old brick apartment buildings and newer prefabricated concrete 
dwellings 
it was an artificial entity prompted by the new governments 
nationalities policy and by military strategy it forms a buffer on 
the border with manchuria 
creating the region also served to counter zionism the movement 
advocating jewish settlement in palestine 
the government hoped large numbers of jewish farmers and 
tradesmen would make the 5000mile trek from moscow and other 
russian cities in 1935 president mikhail kalinin boldly 
predicted in 10 years time birobidzhan will become the most 
important guardian of the jewish national culture 
kalinins hopes were not realized 
comparatively few jews made the trip and of those who did come 
to escape persecution and famine many soon left the climate was 
harsh temperatures reached 13 degrees below zero this winter 
the land was undeveloped and the nations jewish centers were a 
world away 
bolshevik leader leon trotsky a jew who was born lev bronstein 
eventually described the experiment as a bureaucratic farce 
the late soviet leader nikita s khrushchev declared it a failure 
jews never became more than a small minority in the region 
despite lenins stipulation of uniform nationality in such areas 
the jewish autonomous region has 8887 jews 4 percent of the 
regions population and less than onehalf of 1 percent of the 
soviet unions 14 million jews 
official propaganda still portrays the region almost as a jewish 
paradise a showplace of assimilation and a refutation of claims 
that soviet jews are persecuted 
in a dispatch in october 1988 about the russianborn jewish 
writer sholon aleichem the official news agency tass said that 
birobidzhans example clearly shows that the writers dream of 
seeing his people free and happy has come true 
most jews in the region appear to have assimilated and to have 
succumbed to official atheism 
some did not survive josef stalins purge of 1937 and his 
campaign against jewish cosmopolitanism in 1948 exhibits in a 
section of the birobidzhan museum say many jews including 
americans who came to help work the land were killed or sent to 
labor camps 
yiddish schools a publishing house and a theater were closed 
birobidzhan has some appearance of jewish life along with 
factories that make combines shoes and electrical transformers 
signs on stores and public buildings are in yiddish as well as 
russian the main street is not named after lenin as in most 
soviet cities but for sholom aleichem 
in keeping with government policy of treating jews as a 
nationality not a religious group there are some signs of jewish 
culture a theater radio programs in yiddish a cultural club and 
schools where yiddish is taught after a 42year ban a hotel 
restaurant serves pseudojewish cuisine 
there is virtually nothing religious although president mikhail 
s gorbachev has proclaimed official tolerance of religion and 
permitted a revival of religious life nationwide 
kaufman said few young people are interested in the religion and 
he has difficulty assembling the required 10man quorum for 
services 
he would like to see a religious revival he said and hopes a 
young man studying in moscow will become the rabbi in birobidzhan 
the student has been offered the job but some jews in birobidzhan 
said he wasnt interested 
local officials many of them jews seem uninterested in 
improving religious life 
mayor mark kaufman no relation to boris acknowledged the 
logcabin synagogue was in bad shape and pledged to improve 
conditions for worship he also called the synagogue a part of 
jewish history and suggested converting it to a cultural center 
arkady kuperman religion correspondent of the 
yiddishlanguage newspaper birobidzhaner stern said he saw 
nothing wrong with the lack of interest in religion 
we are atheists he said we spent our whole lives without 
god and this doesnt bother me 
at birobidzhans teachertraining college opened in october as 
part of gorbachevs liberalization program there is a jewish 
language and literature department with classes in yiddish hebrew 
classes are planned but not religious instruction 
there are no real believers among us except for old people 
said larisa tsilman one of the institutes two young yiddish 
teachers 
officials see the region as an alternative destination for 
soviet jews considering emigration a few families have applied to 
move here because of what they consider an increase of 
antisemitism elsewhere in the soviet union 
most soviet jews wanting to leave however continue to choose 
israel or the united states 
talk of emigration also increases among jewish residents of 
birobidzhan 
four families went to live abroad last year vladimir okun 66 
who runs the birobidzhan chess club and keeps up with the gossip 
predicts all the jews in the jewish autonomous region will be gone 
in five years

politicians seek the mainstream the way 
explorers once went in quest of the fountain of youth looking for 
comparable benefits both are supposed to offer rejuvenation and 
eternal vigor 
neither has yet been located 
the mainstream is supposed to be the center where the voters 
are but where that is depends on where you stand republican 
nelson a rockefeller made the term his trademark a generation ago 
as he campaigned long and fruitlessly for the white house against 
conservatives he said were extremists they said rockefeller was 
the extremist too liberal by far 
it remained a matter of republican debate through years of 
liberalmoderateconservative struggle the conservatives finally 
won and ronald reagans eight years as president pushed the whole 
political establishment toward the right 
now it is the democrats who are debating the whereabouts of the 
mainstream one man who thinks he has located it is freshman gov 
l douglas wilder of virginia who is urging the national party to 
get into americas new mainstream the force of the future 
the democratic national committee is trying to find winning ways 
at a meeting this weekend while a bloc of party centrists the 
democratic leadership council searches simultaneously in new 
orleans 
those conflicting if not rival meetings congressional and 
national committee chieftains are shuttling between them point to 
the difficulties the democrats face as they seek themes and 
messages that will register with the voters theyve lost five out 
of six presidential elections and at this point their prospects 
for 1992 dont look good 
while wilder is new to the democrats national lineup he may be 
a pivotal figure in their effort to change the odds wilder the 
first black elected governor of a state says the people already 
have embraced the principles that will be the issues of the future 
and are waiting for their leaders to follow 
those principles he says are a combination of strong family 
values individual initiative social conscience and fiscal 
responsibility 
americas new mainstream is not democratic or republican 
conservative or liberal right wing or left wing he says in a 
speech he is delivering to forums around the country it looks 
ahead not behind it unites people rather than pitting them 
against each other it builds rather than destroys 
wilder urges democrats to stop fighting with each other 
crippling their presidential nominees before the real campaigns 
begin 
were doing the other partys work for them and it must stop 
if we are ever again to be more than mere guests at 1600 
pennsylvania avenue wilder said in a washington speech a 
second lesson is equally clear in presidential elections our 
candidates must take the plunge into the waters of americas new 
mainstream 
in more practical terms wilder said americans want to hold the 
line against more government spending and taxes want tougher 
measures against drugs and crime those are republican issues now 
wilder says he proved in virginia that democrats can reclaim them 
and win 
wilder said in an interview that he is prepared to work actively 
for a mainstream democratic candidate in the campaign for the 
partys 1992 presidential nomination 
that would magnify his role because it means the partys ranking 
black office holder could wind up campaigning against jesse 
jackson an almost certain bet to make his third bid for the 
democratic nomination 
the governor doesnt put it that way saying he would not 
campaign against anyone but would work in behalf of a candidate 
whose views mesh with those he described his terms fit other more 
centrist democrats a lot better than they fit jackson 
jacksons prior campaigns have pushed other democrats to the 
left during the contest for nomination to positions that became 
problems after the ticket was picked democrats fear and 
republicans hope that will happen again in 1992 when jacksons 
position will be strengthened because california will hold its 
primary near the beginning of the campaign in 1992 instead of at 
the end jackson got 35 percent of the vote there in 1988 enough 
to put him at or near the top of the field should there be a 
multiplecandidate primary next time 
so a scant three months into his fouryear term as governor 
wilder is an important player at the democratic political table 
for a politician newly come to office the standard reply to 
talk about a national role is a flattered coy sidestep with the 
observation that such speculation is premature 
that is not wilders style 
theres been talk he was told that he might be a vice 
presidential choice in 1992 on a ticket headed by somebody like 
sen lloyd m bentsen of texas 
ive heard that too wilder said

its increasingly fashionable to knock the 
tobacco industry but the salvos from public officials and 
consumers have yet to seriously threaten its political health 
both sides in the battle over cigarette smoking agree the 
tobacco lobby is losing few fights on capitol hill and winning 
significant victories at the state level 
i wouldnt feel sorry for them yet said rep henry waxman 
dcalif chairman of a house health subcommittee they still 
have a formidable amount of power in the congress and influence 
around this country they still have economic clout 
one of the most powerful industry trade groups is the tobacco 
institute representing the nations cigarettemakers the 
institute has nine field offices with three employees each plus 
lobbyists in all the state capitols and some key cities its 
political action committee raises about 200000 for federal 
candidates during each twoyear election cycle and it has pacs in 
many states 
on the other side are antismoking groups growing in both size 
and sophistication making their case with lots of passion and not 
much money 
the two major national groups are the grassroots americans for 
nonsmokers rights and the coalition on smoking or health which 
represents the american heart lung and cancer associations and 
other voluntary health groups 
reinforcing their efforts is health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan who does not miss a chance to slam the tobacco 
industry 
he has attacked campaigns to market new cigarette brands to 
innercity blacks and undereducated young women and reported that 
smoking costs the country 52 billion a year in bad health and lost 
productivity hes also asked advertising agencies to reject 
tobacco accounts tv stations to warn viewers against smoking and 
athletic associations to reject blood money from tobacco 
companies seeking to sponsor sporting events 
and thats just this year 
the tobacco lobby lost a big one when congress passed the 
smoking ban that took effect last month on nearly all domestic 
airline flights its only comparable defeat came in 1983 when the 
federal excise tax on cigarettes was doubled to 16 cents 
after the airline ban took effect some congressmen said they 
would turn their attention to railroads just a few weeks later 
amtrak announced it would eliminate smoking on some trains and in 
some stations effective april 1 
while keeping damages to a minimum in congress the industry 
often has prevailed on the state level its latest project is to 
win statewide preemption laws that impose some smoking 
restrictions but bar cities or counties from passing anything more 
severe 
such laws are a pivotal industry strategy as more and more 
localities enact smoking ordinances one of the strictest took 
effect this year in greensboro nc a key tobacco state 
when you have 95000 local units of government in this country 
and you have a finite amount of resources then the smart thing to 
do is to try to limit the potential for mischief said walker 
merryman a spokesman for the tobacco institute 
mark pertschuk director of the berkeley califbased americans 
for nonsmokers rights said his group is getting its best results 
at the local level thats where 90 percent of antismoking 
activity occurs from protecting nonsmokers to banning vending 
machines and free samples pertschuk said 
preemption laws are thus an extraordinary victory for the 
tobacco industry he said 
a preemption law recently passed in virginia placing 
limitations on public smoking what worries pertschuk more is 
tobacco interests winning in states where their crop never has been 
king like pennsylvania florida and illinois 
but if some state capitols still are in the grip of the tobacco 
lobby pertschuk and others believe the industrys hold on capitol 
hill is weakening 
as evidence they point to the airline smoking ban and a barrage 
of antitobacco proposals pending or soon to be introduced 
some of the plans would ban advertising one would limit ads to 
text only with no logos or photographs and another would give 
states the power to limit cigarette billboards 
others would raise the cigarette excise tax eliminate tax 
breaks for business expenses associated with cigarette advertising 
and promotion tighten federal regulation of toxic cigarette 
ingredients and create a public health agency for tobacco research 
and education campaigns 
proponents say they have momentum from the flight ban victory 
and expect to achieve at least some of their agenda this year 
many of my colleagues understand that public opinion has moved 
dramatically on the whole issue of tobacco waxman said public 
opposition to tobacco is growing the strength of the antismoking 
majority is growing 
pertschuk said the entire antitobacco agenda is passable given 
enough constituent pressure on members of congress 
people just basically laughed at us when we asked to ban 
smoking on airplanes four years ago he recalled it was not 
considered to be at all feasible its just in hindsight that it 
seems doable 
but merryman described the airline smoking ban as an isolated 
defeat 
we were the only opponent he said and the time is long 
long past when any single vested interest could hope to defeat 
legislation 
the airline scenario is unlikely to be repeated because labor 
business and civil liberties groups and even president bush have 
aligned themselves with the institute against various of the other 
initiatives merryman said 
the issues dont dovetail at all he said people who 
dont like smoking on airlines are not in favor of censorship or 
regressive taxation 
even if all the proposals passed merryman said nothing 
thats pending is going to put us out of business 
nor is he worried about sullivans rhetoric or leaks of 
controversial marketing campaigns 
well roll with those punches theyre not fatal by any 
means he said anybody who thinks were down for the count is 
deluding themselves

problems plaguing the nations health care 
system are bringing democrats and republicans physicians and 
consumer advocates together on at least one point change is needed 
but what those changes should be could keep them arguing for a 
long time to come 
meanwhile americas health care bill keeps mounting this year 
medical expenditures are expected to exceed 600 billion nearly 
12 percent of the nations gross national product while as many 
as 37 million people go without any sort of medical insurance 
coverage 
were on an unsustainable path said jack meyer a 
washington health policy consultant 
but he and other analysts say that with many in congress averse 
to new spending and lawmakers still stinging from last years 
repeal of the medicare insurance program for catastrophic illness 
major changes in the health system are not imminent 
the voting public is not yet exercised about this for it to be 
a major political issue but thats changing said lynn 
etheredge a health policy consultant based in chevy chase md 
businesses hit by rising healthcare premiums are passing 
along more of the costs to their workers and pulling back some of 
the benefits health care benefits have been the central issue in a 
growing number of labor strikes 
the average american worker is unaware of the magnitude of 
the cost of healthcare benefits said william ferguson chairman 
of the board of nynex corp where workers last year staged a 
fourmonth strike in which health coverage was a main issue 
but they are starting to wake up workers are beginning to 
understand that rising health costs are putting a dent in their pay 
raises he said at a recent gathering of health care providers 
earlier this month the bipartisan pepper commission which 
included leaders of tax and healthcare committees in congress 
completed a yearlong study with a proposal to provide healthcare 
coverage and longterm care for all americans 
however the heathcare part of the plan was approved by only a 
onevote margin and the package was immediately criticized because 
it did not recommend a way to pay the estimated 66 billion federal 
pricetag 
many of the various players in the existing health care system 
including insurance companies physicians unions and corporations 
have come up with their own proposals 
and new groups and coalitions are still forming around the 
issue just this month 35 major corporations unions consumer 
groups and other private organizations formed the national 
leadership coalition for health care reform its the first attempt 
by big business and labor to join in drafting a plan 
of the proposals that have been put forth so far only a few 
advocate a governmentrun health system or go to the other extreme 
with a purely private approach most fall into a middle ground 
that like the pepper commission calls for a publicprivate 
sharing of the burden 
most of the plans would build on the existing system of 
employerprovided health insurance 85 percent of americans are 
covered in this way now with various incentives or mandates for 
business to include more workers in these programs some would 
create risk pools to make affordable policies available to those 
who because of chronic disease couldnt otherwise afford insurance 
and the government would have responsibility for taking care of the 
rest 
most policy analysts and healthcare consultants say this 
middleground approach is the only one that is politically 
possible but even then its not a sure bet 
we will address a national health plan when the president 
makes it an issue for his administration said henry aaron a 
senior fellow at the brookings institution a liberal think tank in 
washington 
the administration will move when it feels theres a good 
political opportunity he said and the key for any 
administration will be further crumbling of business opposition to 
government involvement 
he doubts the public will rise up in protest and demand 
solutions to the deficiencies in the current system 
any time 85 percent of the population is insured and receives 
the best medical care in the world it may be a little too 
expensive but so are automobiles and people will grouse about that 
theyre not going to grouse enough to make it a salient political 
issue he said

soil and water conservation programs are 
viewed kindly by the public and members of congress almost like 
moms apple pie or dads as the case may be 
but theres a darker side and special people in the agriculture 
department are looking into the cubbyholes and stairwells to see 
what evil lurks in the name of conservation 
another major interest is usda employee integrity and possible 
conflicts of interest within such big divisions as the farmers home 
administration the socalled lender of last resort for lowincome 
rural people 
the specialists are the auditors and criminal investigators of 
the office of inspector general an agency of 850 employees charged 
with preventing and detecting fraud waste and abuse 
conservation and fmha are only a couple of targets in the 
inspector generals hunting grounds every usda agency and program 
operated by the department and the nonfederal entities that 
receive usda aid is subject to scrutiny 
but the huge expansion of the conservation reserve program 
authorized by the 1985 farm law is one of the main focal points of 
this years sleuthing operations 
the program is administered by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service the sprawling agency that 
for decades has channeled federal commodity programs to farmers 
through more than 2800 county offices 
accountants and auditors look at financial statements review 
agency compliance with laws and regulations and sniff out flaws in 
operations that impair effectiveness the investigators are special 
agents who specialize mostly in crimes involving usda programs 
according to the 105page annual plan for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 the inspector generals team is attempting to 
identify largescale schemes and devices used by financial 
institutions and others to evade 50000peryear payment 
limitations specified under conservation reserve program contracts 
the scope of the audits will be limited to individuals 
entities or financial institutions that received a large number of 
crp payments but were not in the land management business prior to 
the crp the report said 
one of the tasks is the evaluation of land and producer 
eligibility for the program the program enables a farmer to take 
highly erodible cropland from production for 10 years and plant it 
in protective grass and trees 
in exchange the government helps pay the cost of installing the 
protective cover plus annual rental payments which average around 
50 an acre about 34 million acres are in the program so far the 
target is to have at least 40 million 
related audits are under way to see if the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service established effective 
controls to verify that farmers receiving 1989 disaster assistance 
complied properly with requirements to purchase federal crop 
insurance for the 1989 crop year other rules also are being looked 
at 
a recent audit survey disclosed several instances where land 
enrolled was not farmed during the base period years and therefore 
was ineligible the report said some farmers have submitted 
false records to ascs to show that acreage was planted in prior 
years 
another round of audits is directed at 1989 drought aid to see 
if crop yields and payment rates were properly used in computing 
assistance for nonprogram crops covered by last years law 
on the investigation side most work originates from referrals 
by usda or other federal agencies and individuals priorities are 
given to threats to public health and safety employee integrity 
including allegations of bribery embezzlement and theft or 
collusion with program recipients and fraud in the loan and 
benefit programs 
recent disclosures of influencepeddling and other improprieties 
in the department of housing and urban development prompted the 
inspector generals planners to conduct an evaluation of the 
controls over and the propriety of rural rental housing project 
approvals in the farmers home administration the report said 
we also plan to conduct a review of the statements certain 
officials are required to file concerning outside financial 
interests and an evaluation of management controls over the 
prevention detection and resolution of prohibited employee 
activities such as conflicts of interest the report said 
additionally the inspector generals plan calls for a 
determination of the feasibility of requiring financial disclosure 
statements by all loanapproval and paymentapproval officials 
food programs including food stamps school lunches and other 
childnutrition functions are fertile grounds for investigators on 
the prowl for fraud and abuse 
this year for example the agency projects that about 33 
percent of its investigative work will involve the food and 
nutrition service about 23 percent will be directed to farmers 
home administration operations and 17 percent to the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
food stamp fraud has often involved largescale operations in 
which thousands or millions of dollars have changed hands through 
the illegal use of the federal coupons in some cases the stamps 
have been used as currency for prohibited items including liquor 
and drugs 
since the authorized retailer is the key to eventual 
redemption of illegally obtained food stamps we will continue to 
place major emphasis in this area the report said 
we will also look at unauthorized retailers including those 
previously disqualified from the food stamp program for serious 
violations who continue to accept food stamps in willful disregard 
of program regulations

the king of the ocean predators is falling victim 
to lands deadliest hunters people and may face doom unless 
governments around the world agree to sharply limit shark catches 
the sharkfishing industry boomed in the 1980s to feed the 
worlds growing appetite for shark meat inexpensive and popular 
with yuppies and for delicacies such as sharkfin soup 
now the dusky shark once common off the northeast coast has 
all but vanished the night shark a formerly reliable catch in the 
florida straits is rarely spotted a lemon shark research project 
in the keys was abandoned last year when researchers could not find 
enough animals 
and sport fishermen report the number of the soughtafter mako 
sharks caught in the atlantic is dropping sharply 
i think we are reaching a critical stage if we are not 
already there said eric hawk administrator for the national 
marine fisheries service in st petersburg there is a strong 
feeling that the reason we have not yet detected a collapse is that 
there are many species out there and its hard to tell if some are 
in trouble 
the us commerce department is ironing out the final wrinkles 
in a plan that would limit to 5800 metric tons roughly a 
halfmillion animals the commercial shark catch in federally 
regulated waters in the gulf of mexico the eastern atlantic and 
caribbean estimates are that three times that amount of shark will 
either thrown away by boats seeking other fish such as tuna or 
caught by sport fishermen 
hawk noted those limits would not apply to state waters where 
65 percent of sport catches occur nor to countries like mexico 
which may take double the us catch 
the fragility of the shark population and the sharks vital role 
in shaping ocean evolution is only now beginning to be understood 
said samuel gruber a university of miami researcher who has spent 
a lifetime studying the ancient animals 
they are more like a whale than a fish they have their young 
one at a time gruber said but the sharks play a much more 
important role than the whales because they maintain the 
ecological health and balance of the seas 
just as wolves and mountain lions once culled antelope herds in 
the american west sharks have been guiding the evolution of fish 
for 400 million years he said 
anecdotal evidence from other biologists and sport fishermen 
indicate the disappearance of sharks has accelerated over the last 
decade coinciding with the boom in commercial shark fishing 
my impression is that the chickens have come home to roost 
this fishing has been going on for about 15 years and thats how 
long it takes for sharks to mature gruber said 
the growing sharkfishing industry is suspicious of the 
biologists data and the marine fisheries plan projected to take 
effect in june they have hired an attorney and expect to sue the 
program 
jim bonnell vice president of the southern offshore fishing 
association and a shark fisherman said reports from commercial 
fishing fleets fail to support the theory that shark populations 
are in trouble 
in the years we have been doing this we havent seen any 
decrease in the number of fish or the size of the fish he said 
the 800member association estimates there are 45 fulltime 
shark boats in the tampa bay area alone and far more than the 150 
estimated by the government in the area covered by the plan many 
fishermen have already been hit hard by new reeffish restrictions 
and switched to shark to make ends meet 
government biologists dont deny their data is sketchy but they 
insist it points to danger for sharks 
a 1980 study estimated maximum sustainable yield for the region 
was 25000 metric tons yet industry reports show that in the past 
decade up to 52000 tons a year was fished annually with most of 
it thrown away by boats that caught sharks by accident as they 
looked for other catches the figure for 1988 the latest year 
available was more than 43000 tons 
theres too many fishermen and were too efficient says 
jack casey a marine fisheries biologist in narragansett ri 
sharks have been in vogue before he said with sometimes 
disastrous results in 1938 several states developed shark fishing 
to meet a demand for the animals liver which is high in vitamin 
a most of the fisheries collapsed within 10 years in part because 
of overexploitation 
government biologists warn that us regulations are not enough 
to guarantee the sharks longterm survival tagged blue sharks 
for instance have been reported caught in 23 nations as they 
migrate through the oceans 
if the states and other nations dont adopt compatible 
measures we are just barking at the moon hawk said

americas 24hour onthego lifestyle is 
turning it into a nation of walking zombies who sacrifice sleep 
to keep up warns a cornell university researcher 
more than 100 million americans work and play with insufficient 
sleep nearly every other adult and teenager 
in addition to damaging an individuals psychological and 
physical wellbeing sleep deprivation costs the united states 
billions of dollars a year in lost productivity and medical costs 
said james maas chairman of cornells psychology department 
nearly half of all americans short themselves of one to two 
hours of sleep per night by weeks end its as if theyd missed a 
full night 
if you lose two hours of sleep because you go to a party on 
saturday night and then for the next five or six days you get your 
normal sleep which for most people is inadequate by friday you 
are like the narcoleptic said maas an awardwinning producer of 
sleep alert a documentary broadcast recently on public 
television and underwritten by north chicagobased abbott 
laboratories 
there are some people who are literally walking zombies he 
said if you need an alarm clock to get up in the morning or if 
you feel more than a minor sag in the middle of the day you need 
more sleep 
maas said he sleeps 7 hours a night but is trying to get eight 
hours 
ive been so busy with this program that im not getting as 
much sleep as i should be right now but ive at least regulated my 
sleeping habits by making sure im in bed every night by the same 
time midnight he said 
more americans undersleep than overeat said dr thomas 
roth director of the sleep disorders research center at henry ford 
hospital in detroit 
there is very little question the impact of sleepiness is 
great he said how many airplanes have to crash because the 
pilot falls asleep how many nuclear plants have to shut down 
because the operator falls asleep 
about 20 million americans have work schedules that include 
night shifts and surveys indicate 55 percent of them nod off at 
least once a week on the job says psychologist richard coleman a 
sleep expert in the film 
these people are not falling asleep on breaks not lying down 
on the job theyre trying to work he said from ross calif 
where he heads a shiftwork operations consulting firm 
three mile island happened at 4 am chernobyl at 2 am 
bhopal at midnight the exxon valdez at around midnight he said 
charles czeisler director for circadian and sleep disorder 
medicine at bostons brigham and womens hospital said part of the 
problem is that shift workers generally are rotated to the earlier 
hours opposite of the bodys biological clock and they are 
switched back and forth too frequently to allow them to adjust 
an institute study at one plant using a rotating shift schedule 
found that accidents increased significantly during the final two 
hours of a shift and were 40 percent greater at night than in the 
daytime he said 
maas documentary looks at how sleepiness affects the judgment 
and reaction time of pilots policemen and medical interns 
one doctor says she measured sleep in minutes when she worked as 
an intern while a retired commercial airline pilot recalls a 
flight when he awoke from a 10minute nap to find the captain and 
flight engineer also dozing 
youre afraid youre going to face somebody with a gun on you 
and you cant react in time because youre so tired and it doesnt 
register fast enough says a policeman 
the consequences of sleepiness loss of initiative and energy 
attention lapses distractibility and fatigue and mistakes dr 
william dement director of the sleep disorders center at the 
stanford university school of medicine said on mass documentary 
the institute for circadian physiology a research center in 
boston has reported that sleeping problems at work cost companies 
roughly 70 billion annually in lost productivity industrial 
accidents and medical bills 
maas said researchers report that after five years people who 
work night shifts are twice as prone to heart ailments and 
gastrointestinal diseases than those who work day hours 
theres even evidence that people getting inadequate sleep 
shorten their life span by eight to 10 years said maas 
in some professions sleepiness can have lifethreatening 
consequences 
the national transportation safety board cited pilot fatigue as 
either the cause or a contributing factor in 69 plane accidents 
from 1983 through 1986 in which 67 people died 
researchers have fashioned a test called the multiple sleep 
latency test to measure sleepiness said roth it is based on the 
premise that the faster people fall asleep the more sleepy they 
are at two hour intervals the subject is asked to spend 20 
minutes in a quiet bedroom trying to fall asleep 
tenyearolds who are fully alert all day never fall asleep 
while narcoleptics are asleep within five minutes on every 
occasion he said high school students often fall asleep as 
regularly and as fast as the narcoleptics he said 
maas said studies show high school seniors get an average of 61 
hours of sleep a day but need about 10 hours to function most 
effectively as many as 30 percent of high school students fall 
asleep in class once a week according to some studies he said 
while it is true children and teenagers need more sleep than 
adults it is a myth that as we grow older we need less sleep a 
typical adult should sleep eight to 8 hours a day said maas 
there are no easy answers people say when am i going to play 
golf or when am i going to do this or that parents and twocareer 
couples have household duties and childrearing duties they want 
some leisure time so what do they cut out they cut out sleep 
time said maas 
an ability to lead a fastpaced life on little sleep is a trait 
perpetuated by our aroundtheclock society with its allnight 
shopping centers cable television and 24hour banking said roth 
in our society sleep restriction is seen as a positive 
thing he said 
our society needs to rethink how it equates naps and staying 
in bed late with laziness said maas we should be just as 
concerned about our sleeping patterns as we are about our diet and 
exercise

mad cow disease has killed 10000 cattle 
restricted the export market for britains cattle industry and 
raised fears about the safety of eating beef 
the government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to 
human health but scientists still arent certain what causes the 
disease or how it is transmitted 
i think everyone agrees that the risks are low says martin 
raff a neurobiologist at university college london but they 
certainly are not zero i have not changed my eating habits but i 
certainly do wonder 
mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse 
was diagnosed only in 1986 the symptoms are very much like 
scrapie a sheep disease which has been in britain since the 1700s 
the incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims in 
late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly 
the suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle 
feed which used to contain sheep byproducts as a protein 
supplement 
the government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in 
june 1988 and later banned the use of cattle brain spleen 
thymus intestines and spinal cord in food for humans sheep offal 
is still used in pig and poultry feed 
earlier this month the government announced it would pay 
farmers 100 percent of market value or average market price 
whichever is less for each animal diagnosed with bse 
i think it is a recognition not just of pressure from 
farmers but that the public would feel more confident that no 
bseinfected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the 
food chain if there was 100 percent compensation said sir simon 
gourlay president of the national farmers union 
the disease struck one of his own cows gourlay said in the 
course of 24 hours the animal went from being ostensibly quite 
normal to very vicious and totally disoriented 
as of feb 9 the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food 
said that 9998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed 
with bse 
the government has paid 61 million in compensation and is 
budgeting 16 million for 1990 
irelands department of agriculture and food said about 20 cases 
have been confirmed there all of them near the border with the 
british province of northern ireland 
because of the disease the us department of agricultures 
animal and plant health inspection service banned imports of 
cattle embryos and bull semen from great britain in july said 
margaret webb a usda spokeswoman in washington 
similar embargoes have been imposed by australia finland 
israel sweden west germany and new zealand according to the 
agriculture ministry and the european community has proposed a ban 
on exports of british cattle older than 6 months 
david maclean a junior agriculture minister has complained of 
bse hysteria in the media and has insisted that the risk of the 
disease passing to humans is remote 
the government has committed 19 million to finding the cause of 
the disease 
a commission chaired by professor sir richard southwood of 
oxford university reported last year that the cause of bse is 
quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses 
the report said the disease was impossible to detect in 
apparently healthy animals because it did not prompt the immune 
system to produce antibodies 
the southwood report said it was most unlikely that the 
disease was a threat to humans but the report added if our 
assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect the implications 
would be extremely serious 
there is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy known as 
creutzfeldtjakob disease about two dozen cases were reported in 
britain last year 
another form known as kuru had been found cannibals in new 
guinea 
according to a report in the british medical journal the 
incidence of creutzfeldtjakob disease is no higher in britain than 
it is in countries free of scrapie 
it is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the 
lack of effect of bse on human health a consultative committee 
reported to the agriculture ministry the committees report 
released early this year said it is only a shrewd guess that 
bse was transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed

the special containers that make waffles brown 
and french fries crisp in microwave ovens have prompted authorities 
to question whether unsafe levels of chemicals are ending up in 
food 
at issue are heat susceptors metallized discs or strips built 
into packaging that absorb microwaves and act as little frying 
pans to brown or crisp foods like fish sticks and pizza or pop 
most of the kernels in a bag of popcorn 
at least one consumer advocacy group recommends consumers avoid 
products containing susceptors until the us food and drug 
adminstration determines if worrisome levels of chemicals in the 
packages migrate into food during cooking 
we need to know what chemicals are getting into foods at what 
levels said lester borodinsky a chemist with the fdas division 
of food chemistry and technology 
although the package components have fda approval the agency 
did not evaluate them at temperatures above 300 degrees heat 
susceptors can reach 500 degrees 
our crystal balls werent very good back then borodinsky 
said if you think back 25 years ago there were not very many 
microwave ovens in use these packages were not envisioned 
and flowed through cracks and 
fissures to lowlying areas as far as 400 miles to the north over 
the next 2 million years creating the plateau the theory holds 
another upwelling of lava is responsible for a hot spot of 
volcanic activity beneath yellowstone the scientists suggest 
the origin of hot spots far from the geologic plate boundaries 
where most volcanos are located is a longstanding mystery in 
geology as the earths crustal plates drift over stationary hot 
spots new volcanos are formed and old ones become extinct

if the united states fails to become a 
world leader in solar energy a trilliondollar new market could 
fall to the japanese a national conference on solar power was told 
frankly there has been a tendency by energy companies in the 
past to label solar energy as a joke said s david freeman 
general manager of the lower colorado river authority 
if we keep this up the joke will be on us we will see the 
japanese come in and put photovoltaic cells on our roofs and 
solarpowered cars on our roads freeman said in the keynote 
speech last week at a national solar energy conference 
freemans agency provides electric power to 33 cities and 11 
cooperatives in texas he previously was an energy adviser in the 
johnson nixon and carter administrations and was board chairman of 
the tennessee valley authority 
he told the conference that historians in the future may wonder 
why solar power wasnt investigated more vigorously during the late 
20th century while nations so heavily used such technologically 
difficult and environmentally risky sources as oil and nuclear 
energy 
freeman said a solarenergy breakthrough is crucial to the 
survival of a highenergy civilization particularly when us oil 
imports are soaring and concerns are growing over the environment 
if one looks at the awesome problems posed by nuclear power 
at its best one must wonder why this nation has not long ago 
embarked on a manhattantype project to harness the sun he 
said 
freeman said he doesnt believe the solar industry needs 
subsidies but we do need to be advocating pollution taxes to 
reduce pollution and to reduce the federal deficit he said

largest stock exchange which has plunged more than 20 percent 
since the start of the year 
the nikkei lost a combined 180925 points on monday and 
tuesday the markets were closed wednesday because of a national 
holiday 
the usually lively crowded floor of the tokyo stock exchange 
was sober and subdued as a rush of sell orders met with virtually 
no buyers almost half of the issues listed on the the exchange 
trading floors electronic billboard remained unquoted 
trading was estimated at an exceptionally low 180 million shares 
selling came mainly from institutional investors acting prior 
to the yearend account settlements said yoshio shimoyama a 
chief dealer at nikko securities co 
the sales were intended to offset earlier losses or cash out 
losing positions he said institutional investors have been 
selling in an attempt to reduce risk ahead of closing their books 
for fiscal 1989 which ends march 31 
shimoyama said the yens continuing weakness despite the 
discount rate increase accelerated selling 
japans central bank raised its official discount rate tuesday 
by one percentage point to 525 percent analysts blamed a delay in

thursday morning but the action had no major impact on the yen 
dealers said 
local news reports said the bank sold about 700 million the 
central bank does not officially comment on its market 
interventions 
traders attributed the dollars higher opening in tokyo to a 
strong showing in new york on wednesday multiple factors 
including escalating tensions in the soviet republic of lithuania 
were said to have contributed to the us currencys strength 
lithuania declared its independence from the soviet union on 
march 11 but the soviets have termed the move illegal soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev wednesday ordered lithuanians to turn 
in their weapons

treasury secretary nicholas brady says he 
opposes a proposed bill to tax the shortterm capital gains of 
pension funds because it might open the legislative door to other 
unwanted taxes 
brady told a senate panel wednesday that while the treasury 
department does not now support the proposed legislation we 
applaud its objectives of promoting longterm investment 
but brady told the senate finance committee that agreeing to a 
tax on pension funds might lead to taxes on individuals and other 
entities to which we would be opposed 
the bill sponsored by kansas republican senators robert dole 
and nancy landon kassebaum would tax the capital gains that 
pension funds make from the sale of securities held less than six 
months the bill would tax only funds with 1 million or more in 
assets most funds now pay no tax on any gains 
in 1987 pension funds held 24 percent of the securities traded 
in this country 
i believe that steps are needed to lengthen the time horizons 
of investors and corporate executives brady testified 
however i am concerned that we have not thought long enough to 
be sure the bill is the answer 
brady said the treasury wanted to work with congress to devise a 
plan balancing the needs for market liquidity capital and a secure 
source of retirement income 
he suggested working through bush administration proposals to 
cut the capital gains tax and encourage family savings through tax 
incentives 
business executives and critics of the 1980s merger mania have 
complained that investors particularly large institutional 
investors like pension funds have been concerned only with 
shortterm profit on their shareholdings 
they argue that has increased the pressure on corporations to 
concentrate on the quarterly bottom line at the expense of 
longrange planning research and development and nurturing 
endeavors that dont promise quick returns 
that bodes ill for our countrys future economic growth and 
prosperity said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the committee 
chairman 
earlier kassebaum told the committee the bill is not designed 
to raise revenue i would be happy if it didnt raise any revenue 
at all 
her bill would impose a 10 percent tax on pension fund profits 
from the sale of securities held up to 30 days and a 5 percent tax 
on gains from securities held between 30 and 180 days 
opposition to taxing pension fund capital gains also came from

the nations new economic ministers 
said wednesday they would shelve or modify most of the radical 
economic reforms pushed by their predecessors including a system 
requiring use of true names on financial transactions 
the nations largest opposition party warned that any reversal 
of reform policies would heighten political tension by incurring 
violent protests by dissidents and underprivileged groups 
new economic planning minister lee seungyun declined to discuss 
details but said he would announce by the end of this month new 
prescriptions to help revive the sagging south korean economy 
all policies are subject to change as the prevailing 
circumstances warrant and i think it is feared some landmark 
reforms being pushed could create a lot of problems he told 
reporters 
the controversial reforms center on a system requiring koreans 
to use their true names in all financial transactions beginning 
next year 
outgoing economic ministers said the new system would promote a 
fair economic environment by preventing tax evasion on all 
financial transactions 
but the new system is shocking to millions of koreans who are 
used to using pseudonyms for secret dealings in stocks bonds and 
bank accounts 
government analysts estimate that about 10 percent of all korean 
financial transactions are conducted using pseudonyms and about 30 
percent of bank accounts are kept under false names 
investors already have begun moving their money to overseas 
accounts and land speculation land and housing prices more than 
doubled in the past year 
kim daejung president of the largest and most radical 
opposition group the party for peace and democracy warned that a 
cancellation or stay of the system would sharpen social and 
political antagonism 
the shelving of the system would only benefit big businesses 
and those who have those who have not will feel frustrated and 
protest more vigorously he said 
lee a 58yearold exfinance minister was named to the 
nations top economic post in a sweeping cabinet reshuffle last 
saturday that affected 15 of 22 posts 
south koreas economy is experiencing difficulty with slow 
exports high inflation and low capital investment exports in the 
first two months of the year shrank 25 percent from a year ago 
helping create a trade deficit of 127 billion 
the consumer price index rose 1 percent in january and 09 
percent in february threatening the governments plan to curb 1990 
inflation to 7 or 8 percent 
unemployment rose from 23 percent to 26 percent this year 
after the nations economy grew only 65 percent last year which 
compared with annual doubledigit growth rates in the three 
previous years 
last years korean growth rate remains high by international 
standards but experts say the korean economy needs to grow at 
least at least 7 percent a year to absorb 700000 new people 
seeking jobs annually 
one aide speaking on condition of anonymity said bank lending 
rates currently ranging between 10 and 125 percent could be cut by 
at least 1 percent soon as an economic stimulation move

a gunshot hit a greyhound bus wednesday night 
cracking a window but leaving the driver and passengers unhurt in 
the latest violence in the strike against the countrys only 
nationwide bus company authorities said 
in another development three days after greyhound broke off 
contract talks with its striking drivers the company expanded bus 
service to 70 new locations mostly between boston and washington 
the bus carrying 30 passengers to dallas was on an entrance 
ramp to interstate 35 in san antonio around 730 pm when the 
bullet hit its service door said travis county sheriffs lt 
george meek 
the driver continued about 70 miles north to austin before 
reporting the shooting meek said the assailant was unknown 
the bullet penetrated the first window of the doublewindow 
door but not the second because it contained thick insulated 
plastic the lieutenant said 
the incident brought to at least 15 the number of shooting 
attacks on greyhound buses there have also been 46 bomb threats 
and numerous other incidents of vandalism or threats company 
officials say 
state police in virginia investigated a shooting attack on a 
greyhound bus carrying about 50 passengers from roanoke into 
christiansburg late tuesday no one was injured trooper er adams 
said holes in the windshield apparently were made by a 
smallcaliber rifle 
greyhound abruptly ended strike talks sunday accusing union 
leaders of stonewalling and of stepping up attacks on buses and 
replacement drivers 
unions representing 6300 drivers and an estimated 3000 other 
greyhound workers walked out march 2 over wages job security and 
grievance procedures 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions said it would 
resume negotiations at any time 
the company walked away from the table about 10 am sunday 
but the union stayed at the table said union spokesman nick 
nichols as far as we are concerned we are still at the table 
waiting for them to come back 
frank j schmieder president and chief operating officer of 
greyhound lines inc said that as of wednesday we are running 
46 percent of our prestrike schedule miles that is an increase of 
35617 miles daily compared to yesterday or 14 percent 
that included restoration of service to 70 locations mostly in 
the bostonwashington corrider as replacement drivers complete 
training greyhound spokesman george gravley said 
today were up to 1514 drivers gravley said the first 
day we had around 300 
tuesdays ridership was 45829 passengers about onethird of 
ridership on the same day last year the company said 
the union said it believes greyhound is operating at 15 percent 
of prestrike levels a restoration of service to 70 communities 
when greyhound served 9500 doesnt say much said spokesman 
nichols 
in chattanooga tenn a judge issued a restraining order 
wednesday limiting picketing at the citys greyhound terminal to 
two people and forbidding acts of violence or intimidation a 
similar restraining order was issued tuesday in fayetteville nc 
the company has obtained a total of 17 restraining orders 
against the union gravley said 
greyhound downplayed tuesdays decision by standard amp poors to 
downgrade the companys credit rating from b to b wall streets 
premier bond rating company cited a 380 million debt from a 1987 
leveraged buyout and said the strike has caused substantial 
losses 
we feel we have a sound financial position and were just 
continuing to operate as we had planned to do all along gravley 
said were not in the market to borrow money right now so its 
not going to affect us immediately

world of shopping in new york is part of a broader promotion of 
the positive aspects of new yorks businesses variations on the 
theres a world of theme eventually will be adapted for 
restaurants theatre health care banking and other industries 
retail was chosen as the subject to kick off the feelgood 
campaign in part because city government officials and business 
leaders felt it was time to highlight the pluses because the 
minuses had been getting a lot of attention

opportunities in the city and attracting retailers to open 
businesses here 
he said the ads arent meant to refute the widely publized 
problems that have been plaguing numerous retailers 
were not going to be talking about the negative those 
problems have been disproportionately blown up he said in an 
interviewthis is simply to remind people of the vastness and the 
diversity that is new york city 
the plight of several prominent us retailers grabbed headlines 
over the christmas season 
as the peak shopping season started b altman amp co a 
venerable old retailer went into liquidation department stores 
owned by the debt encumbered campeau corp including 
bloomingdales slashed prices to boost sales and raise cash 
forcing their more financially sound competitors to follow suit

meeting hosted by the association for a better new york the fifth 
avenue association and the mayors office for economic development

amtrak will eliminate smoking next month on 
some trains and in some stations under new policies that will more 
strongly segregate nonsmokers and those who want to light up 
noreservation trains of three or fewer cars will be designated 
nosmoking amtrak spokeswoman sue martin said wednesday 
this will affect a number of trains in the east some in the 
midwest and one in the northwest she said seventeen routes 
will have some trains that at least on some days have no smoking at 
all 
two lawmakers who led the successful fight to ban smoking on 
most domestic flights said wednesday that the nations passenger 
railroad would adopt the tougher smoking policies april 1 
they jumped the gun on amtraks own announcement of the new 
policy which had been scheduled for today 
these new rules are another victory for health and common 
sense said sen frank lautenberg dnj chairman of the senate 
appropriations subcommittee on transportation its further 
acknowledgement that nonsmokers should not be forced to breathe 
other peoples smoke 
lautenberg and rep richard durbin dill a member of the 
house transportation appropriations panel had said after the 
airline smoking ban took effect feb 25 that they would turn their 
attention to railroads 
it is my hope that eventually nonsmokers will be able to ride 
smokefree on all forms of public transportation durbin said 
although passengers will be permitted to smoke in sleeping 
compartments and lounges on longer trains smoking will be 
eliminated in 
firstclass cars on all trains in the northeast corridor that 
dont require reservations reservedseat metroliners will carry 
smoking cars and will set aside smoking areas in firstclass cars 
all areas except a portion of the lounge on other trains 
requiring reservations 
coach cars of reservedseat doubledeck superliners operating 
west of chicago currently amtrak allows smoking in the last four 
rows of superliner coaches the new policy will limit superliner 
smoking to the lower level of the lounge car ms martin said 
stations smaller than 1100 square feet 
at least threequarters of the area of larger stations 
amtraks ultimate goal is to separate the 25 percent of its 
passengers who smoke from the 75 percent who do not ms martin 
said toward that end amtrak will begin locating its smoking cars 
at the front or rear of unreserved trains so nonsmokers need not 
walk through smoking areas to reach their seats 
the amtrak policy changes drew fire from the tobacco institute 
the lobby for cigarette manufacturers 
once again were seeing unnecessary regulation above and 
beyond what is necessary said institute spokesman thomas lauria 
train travelers have accommodated each other smokers and 
nonsmokers alike ever since weve had trains lauria said 
obviously this is an attempt to put smokers in the back of the 
bus once again on shorter trains it seems meanspirited to ban 
smoking altogether 
lauria said he anticipated resistance from smokers to amtraks 
intended smoking restrictions in stations 
according to ms martin the changes are part of the national 
passenger railroads finetuning of its smoking policy as the 
number of smokers drops 
we feel it is very important for our marketing effort to 
continue to permit smoking on longer trips ms martin said it 
simply doesnt make good business sense to eliminate smoking 
altogether

japanese tourists shell out so much money for 
macadamia nuts when they visit hawaii that agriculture department 
trade analysts refer to the nutty souvenirs as suitcase exports 
macadamia nut production is also catching on in california and 
in other countries the us output has more than doubled since the 
late 1970s to an estimated 5900 metric tons in 1989 
john oconnell of the departments foreign agricultural service 
said world macadamia production has been growing rapidly including 
a 60 percent increase in australia since 1987 a sharp expansion is 
also indicated over the next decade in africa and central america 
with trees popping up all over it has been estimated that the 
world supply of macadamia nuts will double in five years and triple 
in 10 oconnell reports in the april issue of agexporter 
magazine 
that will cause producing countries to compete fiercely for 
export markets he said 
oconnell added wednesday in a telephone interview that the 
socalled suitcase exports of macadamia nuts to japan are almost 
impossible to estimate accurately although 15 million annually 
may be conservative 
the value of direct nut exports is approximately 5 million a 
year meaning that the suitcase shipments are at least triple the 
known level he said 
in his report oconnell said the japanese custom of giving 
gifts after returning from a vacation is behind the macadamia mania 
local retailers in hawaii have observed that a japanese 
tourist will often buy several boxes or even a case of macadamia 
nut products while mainland us tourists usually buy only one or 
two boxes he said 
several other asian markets are developing including hong kong 
singapore and south korea but if promoters have their way the 
biggest export prize yet may be europe where macadamia nuts are a 
relatively unknown oddity 
oconnell said macadamia trees are native to australia but 
commercial nut production began in hawaii after world war ii the 
nuts are similar in size and shape to filberts but have a taste and 
texture all their own 
harvested nuts are dehulled cracked and roasted before being 
processed into salted candycoated or chocolatecoated forms or 
used as ingredients in bakery dairy and other products

the agriculture council of america says it 
intends to set the record straight about the safety of the us 
food supply 
according to the washingtonbased organization a foodwatch 
campaign will involve a nationwide education and awareness program 
to inform the public about extensive health and safety measures 
currently in place that govern how food is grown and processed 
the program also will focus on the importance of biotechnology 
being developed and its role in maintaining and improve the food 
supply 
reflecting on the events of 1989 we saw a year filled with 
consumer skepticism about the food supply the aca said in a 
recent report one news article after another raised new concerns 
over the integrity of the us food supply and the technology used 
to produce it 
the aca and its education foundation represent a crosssection 
of farm commodity and agribusiness interests 
larry sitzman a corn farmer from culbertson neb is chairman 
of the foodwatch committee he said farmers should be proud of what 
they produce 
we need to be working together to keep our food and fiber 
system the best not pulling it apart sitzman said

the president of japans largest corporation was 
taking calls from irate shareholders this morning as the price of 
the companys stock fell more than 500 a share 
like the heads of many other japanese companies haruo 
yamaguchi chief executive of telecommunications giant nippon 
telegraph and telephone corp was struggling to find an 
explanation for the dive 
ntts performance has not weakened at all we cant avoid 
drifting with the general current yamaguchi told reporters at a 
luncheon gathering 
ntt stock japans most expensive fell 516 a share this 
morning but recovered slightly in the afternoon closing at 6903 
a loss of 452 or 61 percent for the day 
the tokyo stock exchanges leading index plunged nearly 6 
percent in the morning but recovered somewhat to end the day off 
313 percent 
we are making the utmost efforts to raise the price 
yamaguchi said 
ntts stock was first offered to the public at 7742 a share in 
february 1987 two years after the former telecommunications 
monopoly was turned into a private company it had the largest 
stock market valuation in the world 
he said ntt plans to seek approval at its stockholders meeting 
in june to raise the dividend from 3225 to 3870 or 12 percent 
of one shares face value of 32250 
yamaguchi said he owns 10 shares adding that he and other 
directors are not permitted to sell their shares 
on the first day ntt stock was listed on the tokyo exchange in 
1987 there were 128 million buy orders for the 10000 shares then 
offered two months later ntt was trading at 20516 a share 
most japanese share prices are in the 6 to 13 range 
as more and more japanese turned to the stock market in efforts 
to expand their sizable savings investors saw ntt shares as a safe 
bet although thenntt president hisashi shinto expressed worries 
about a collapse in its price 
i was a high school student in 1938 he said and i still 
remember clearly the panic of the stock market crash 
the tokyo markets key index fell 149 percent in the october 
1987 global crash but quickly recovered 
it ended 1989 trading with a series of record highs before 
turning around this year and falling 23 percent amid worries over 
higher interest rates and declines in bond prices and the yens 
value 
ntt stock had its own problems including declining investor 
interest in telecommunications then shinto and other ntt 
executives were implicated early last year in a major bribery 
scandal 
for the fiscal year ended march 1989 ntt reported a 143 
percent decline in unconsolidated pretax profits it cited lower 
longdistance revenues after competitors were allowed in the 
market and lower revenue from data communications services 
in september the government which still owns 102 million of 
ntts 156 million outstanding shares put off plans to sell 195 
million shares to the public it cited various factors including a 
slump in ntts share price which was then about 9678 
more recently investors have been put off by calls by a 
government advisory committee for breaking ntt into three separate 
companies for local longdistance and mobile telecommunications 
still yamaguchi said he did not understand the latest slump in 
the stock price which fell 129 on monday and 258 on tuesday the 
market was closed wednesday for a holiday

north carolina states computer labs have 
been hit by a virus which is leaving students smoking over its 
message 
your computer has been stoned legalize marijuana 
the virus is known as stoned it first popped up in 
wellington new zealand in 1988 and slowly has been wreaking havoc 
on computers across the world 
on the north carolina state campus the virus has wiped out some 
students work in computer labs 
it has been nightmarish said tracy carver a lab assistant 
in the humanities computer lab where stoned became such a 
menace that the lab had to shut down for a day and a half this past 
week 
computer labs across campus are requiring users to check their 
floppy disks at the door so they can be scanned for stoned to 
make sure it is kept under control 
the efforts have worked so far but on tuesday stoned was 
making its propot pitch known again in the social sciences 
computer lab 
computer viruses like stoned are programs that copy 
themselves between computers and destroy files overload the system 
or otherwise irritate users more than 70 such viruses are known to 
be circulating worldwide with points of origin as far flung as 
jerusalem birthplace of a virus that deletes files at random on 
friday the 13th and the netherlands first home to the holland 
girl virus that provides victims with the phone number of a girl 
named sylvia after the damage has been done 
witty though the creators of such virus programs may be campus 
computer users arent laughing 
this is a perverse form of intellectual sabotage said 
michael vasu director of the social sciences computer lab the 
only purpose to write a virus is to destroy you have someone with 
a high degree of technical competence who needs a basic course in 
ethics

a concerted campaign to make it easier to sell 
american products in japan appears to be yielding some results but 
also is triggering debate over how far tokyo should go to meet us 
demands 
negotiators on both sides are racing to meet a midapril 
deadline for a report on progress toward reforming business 
practices and laws that hinder efforts to reduce japans 49 
billion trade surplus with the united states 
washington has been demanding urgent action on key trade issues 
it contends that japans business world is too closed that land 
policies sharply boost the cost of doing business in japan and that 
this country should increase public investment to help reduce 
dependence on exports for economic growth 
in a march 23 summit with president bush and in talks with 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher in tokyo last week prime 
minister toshiki kaifu pledged to carry out some of the reforms 
sought in the negotiations 
at kaifus behest trade officials are drafting an interim 
report on steps to narrow the trade gap and the reforms the report 
is to be released in midapril and japanese reports say japanese 
and us officials are working on it this week in warrenton va a 
final report on the talks is due in july 
japanese press reports on the draft report which has not been 
made public indicate kaifu is making limited progress on the types 
of major changes demanded by the united states 
fair trade commission officials said tuesday they were 
considering raising penalties for violations of japans 
antimonopoly law us officials say lax enforcement of the law 
enables japanese companies to form cartels and exclude foreign 
firms from their markets in a number of areas including 
construction and electronics 
local media say the interim report also includes plans to ease 
enforcement of a japanese law that protects small neighborhood 
shops from large retail competition 
us negotiators contend that by forcing supermarkets and 
department stores to wait up to 10 years to open new outlets the 
law prevents foreignowned stores like toys r us from setting up 
shop in japan larger japanese stores are more likely than small 
shops to sell foreignmade goods they say 
mosbacher sent to tokyo by bush to follow up on trade 
demands returned to washington with at least one souvenir pledges 
from two japanese car makers to buy more americanmade 
semiconductors and promising responses from other major 
corporations 
the economic newspaper nihon keizai shimbun says the draft 
report includes plans to step up spending on roads sewers and 
parks ease restrictions on corporate takeover bids and impose 
higher taxes on some farmland in an attempt make more available for 
commercial and residential use thus pushing down skyhigh land 
prices 
despite these signs of progress japanese negotiators are shying 
away from us requests for measures requiring legislative approval 
japanese officials have refused to comment on the media reports 
japans business community has strongly opposed us calls to 
revise the antimonopoly law saying it only needs more rigorous 
enforcement there also is strong opposition to abolishing the 
retail stores law which business leaders and officials say would 
cause an economic slump 
they express concern that the farreaching reforms demanded by 
washington would sacrifice traditional sectors of the economy like 
small shops and perhaps even the nations robust economic growth 
for the sake of uncertain improvement in trade figures 
and despite calls for fully opening its agricultural markets to 
reduce high food prices japan has remained adamant against lifting 
a ban on rice imports it says it wants to protect its 
selfsufficiency in a staple food and preserve rural traditions 
while many analysts say us pressure is needed to bring 
consumeroriented reforms in japan they say the onus for change 
should be placed on washington 
america believes japan needs to make big changes most 
japanese dont we have made big changes already its necessary 
for the united states to change former trade ministry official 
makoto kuroda told the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper in a recent 
interview echoing the sentiments of many past and present trade 
officials 
the officials also question whether the united states will 
follow through on pledged reforms aimed at boosting export 
competitiveness and reducing the high consumption fueling demand 
for imports 
we are under pressure to show results but we will only 
promise what we can actually carry out said one japanese 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity the us side will 
promise all sorts of things but theres no guarantee they can 
follow through 
recent trade figures indicate the two countries are slowly 
whittling away at their enormous trade imbalance which accounts 
for 45 percent of the total 1059 billion us trade deficit 
the trade imbalance which peaked at 579 billion in 1987 was 
49 billion last year in january it dropped to its lowest montly 
level in five years 29 billion 
we are on the right track the question is whether it will 
move fast enough to meet political demands the official said

britains merchandise trade deficit narrowed 
sharply to a betterthanexpected 223 billion in february the 
government said thursday 
the reported providing some relief to the financial markets by 
easing the pressure for another interest rate hike 
the seasonally adjusted shortfall compared with a revised 
deficit of 323 billion in january the central statistical office 
said 
the markets have been worried that britains 15 percent interest 
rates would be raised to boost a sagging pound and fight 77 
percent inflation such a hike had seemed more likely after 
analysts said the governments new budget announced tuesday 
wasnt austere enough to curb inflation 
the current account deficit also narrowed to 223 billion from 
323 billion the office said 
the merchandise trade and current account figures were the same 
because the invisible trade included in the current account figures 
was in balance in february invisible trade includes services 
overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments 
the financial markets had been expecting a merchandise trade 
deficit of 24 billion and a current account deficit of 25 
billion 
exports fell to 134 billion in february from a revised 136 
billion in january imports fell to 157 billion from a revised 
168 billion 
since the beginning of the year britains merchandise trade 
deficit has shrunk to 55 billion compared with a deficit of 67 
billion at the same time a year ago

a traveler cant do much about making an 
airliner arrive on time but it is possible to avoid flights that 
are notoriously late 
more than two years after a law required airlines to report the 
ontime performance of each flight few passengers seem to be 
taking advantage of a simple clue to flight tardiness 
the clue is a single digit in the code every flight is assigned 
in travel agent and airliner computers on a scale of 9 to 0 each 
flight is rated for punctuality 
an example if you were thinking of taking usair flight 896 from 
philadelphia to boston at 555 pm you could know that your 
chances of arriving late are excellent late is defined as more 
than 15 minutes behind schedule 
in the latest monthly report covering january that flight was 
rated 0 and was the tardiest in the country arriving an 
average of 44 minutes late 964 percent of the time 
the clue lies in the flights code that appears in airline and 
travel agent computers the current code for the usair flight has 
improved to a 1 that means that lately it has been arriving on 
time between 10 and 20 percent of the time 
a 2 at the end of a flights computer code would mean the 
flight lands on time between 20 and 30 percent of the time and so 
on up to the 90 to 100 percent range 
a rating of less than 30 percent gets chronically late 
honors in the transportation departments monthly air travel 
consumer report 
so what does a traveler do if the flight has a low score 
a philadelphia passenger who wants to improve the odds of 
arriving on time in boston could take delta flight 648 at 450 
pm which has a 60 to 70 percent ontime record or usair flight 
424 at 5 pm which has a 40 to 50 percent record 
but how often do customers ask for this information 
no one ever has said yolande frommer referring to 
customers at her washington dc travel agency 
theyll ask the type of aircraft how many seats are in a row 
where the exits are and what movie is playing she said but they 
dont think to ask the chances of the plane arriving on time even 
though it often is a major concern 
many people simply arent aware that the information is 
available 
phil davidoff presidentelect of the american society of travel 
agents said that although few travelers ask for the data some 
agents notify customers when the ontime rating is below 50 percent 
its clearly down the line in factors that will affect a 
decision about which flight to take davidoff said 
the data come from the airlines which are required by law to 
report to the government each month delays due to mechanical 
problems are not counted in the ratings because the government 
thinks that including them might encourage airlines to rush repairs 
to keep up their ontime rating 
richard livingston of the airline passengers association of 
north america a consumer and safety advocacy group said he thinks 
the government should pay more attention to the relative safety and 
security of flights instead of collecting data that might not be 
used by passengers 
they tend to focus too much on delays he said 
in addition to the flight data the monthly transportation 
department report tells which of the 30 busiest airports have the 
most ontime arrivals at each hour of the day it also tallies lost 
baggage reports and logs consumer complaints to the government

toys intended for older children often get 
into the hands of younger siblings so the federal consumer 
protection agency says some of them should have warning labels 
the consumer product safety commission moved wednesday to 
require labels warning that younger children can choke on small 
parts in toys intended for children over age 3 
the commission told its staff to devise rules for the toy 
industry to develop mandatory warning labels for toys intended for 
3 to 6 yearolds which have potentially dangerous small parts 
the products affected include toys intended for children ages 3 
to 6 games such as jacks which include small balls marbles 
and balloons 
the commission left unanswered whether the new rules might also 
apply to childrens jewelry and other accessories arts and craft 
equipment puzzles and other items 
in moving toward hazard warnings for specific toys the 
commission sidestepped urgings by consumer groups and members of 
the medical community to review and develop a new smallparts 
standard 
the agency has received reports of 146 deaths since 1980 of 
children under age three involving products intended for older 
children but staffers said they could identify only eight which 
might have been prevented by use of a more different test standard 
the potential benefits to change are low said commission

authorities were investigating three incidents in 
which greyhound buses were fired upon by unknown assailants the 
latest in a string of shootings since company drivers went on 
strike nearly three weeks ago 
none of the shootings which occurred wednesday night in texas 
and early today in missouri and illinois caused any injuries said 
greyhound spokesman george gravley 
in another development the drivers union disputed greyhounds 
claim that it is operating at 46 percent of its prestrike 
schedule based on mileage covered a spokesman for the amalgamated 
council of greyhound local unions estimated that greyhound is 
operating at 15 percent of prestrike levels 
the latest round of violence brings the number of shootings to 
at least 17 since the strike began march 2 
in san antonio a sheriffs officer said 30 passengers were 
aboard the bus when a bullet struck its service door on an entrance 
ramp of interstate 35 
the bullet did not penetrate the thick window and the 
dallasbound bus continued about 80 miles north to austin before 
its driver reported the shooting said travis county sheriffs lt 
george meek 
a second shooting was reported on interstate 55 south of st 
louis when two shots struck the windshield of a bus carrying 19 
passengers from st louis to memphis tenn the incident was being 
investigated by the missouri highway patrol gravley said 
at collinsville ill not far from st louis four shots struck 
a bus en route from chicago to st louis gravley said eight 
passengers were aboard when the two shots struck the windshield and 
two struck the side of the bus 
the company announced wednesday that it had restored service to 
70 locations mostly in the bostonwashington corrider replacement 
drivers who completed training took over most of the routes said 
gravley 
starting today we are running 46 percent of our prestrike 
schedule miles frank j schmieder president and chief operating 
officer of greyhound lines inc said wednesday 
but union spokesman nick nichols said restoration of service to 
70 communities when greyhound had served 9500 doesnt say 
much 
gravley said greyhound had 1514 drivers five times more than 
it did the first day of the strike 
about 6300 drivers and 3000 other employees struck the company 
over wages job security and grievance procedures contract talks 
broke down sunday in arizona and have not been rescheduled 
union officials said the company offered a plan that failed to 
include guaranteed pay raises but would have made raises 
contingent on increased profits and ridership 
the company says in addition to the shootings 46 bomb threats 
and other incidents of vandalism have been logged 
nichols said the union has documented at least 32 incidents of 
violence against strikers including the death of a picketer who 
was crushed by a bus and assaults by greyhound managers against 
pickets 
regrettably this stuff is happening nichols said both 
sides are i believe legitimately concerned about it i dont know 
what more we can to convince people that regardless of whether 
theyre union members or not that this is not the way to behave

two big textile companies cone mills corp and milliken amp co 
said they were laying off more than 800 employees between them 
because of increased competition from imports 
cone mills said wednesday it was shutting down its 450employee 
american spinning plant in greenville sc 
meanwhile milliken said it would close a mill in robbins sc 
putting 255 people out of work and would eliminate 129 jobs from 
its drayton mill in spartanburg sc 
a statement issued to milliken employees wednesday afternoon 
said that while all of us have worked very hard to be successful 
with our customers it has not been enough to overcome the massive 
continuing growth of imported textile products into the united 
states 
this huge and escalating textile import burden has directly 
impacted the drayton plant and made it impossible for that plant to 
continue full operations a company statement said 
cone mills chairman dewey trogdon also cited imports in the 
closing the american spinning plant he also blamed rising fiber 
costs and the plants multistoried layout which made it 
impractical to install more modern equipment 
employees learned of their job losses as the house textile 
caucus launched a new campaign for legislation to curb imports of 
textiles and apparel 
milliken spokesman terry may and cone mills spokesman jim butner 
said the cutbacks had been considered for several weeks but both 
said the announcements were not timed to coincide with the textile 
caucuss decision to introduce a textile bill

debtridden southland corp which owns 7000 
7eleven convenience stores said today it has agreed to sell a 
controlling interest to its japanese partners for 400 million and 
the assumption of debt 
itoyokado co ltd japans secondlargest supermarket 
operator and longtime southland affiliate 7eleven japan which 
itoyokado controls would acquire 75 percent of southlands common 
stock under terms of the deal southland said in a statement 
the japanese companies would pay 400 million in cash the deal 
is contingent upon the restructuring of southlands 18 billion in 
debt and of its outstanding preferred stock 
the deal which has been approved by southlands board also 
must be approved by a syndicate of 32 banks the companys lenders 
southland spokeswoman cecilia norwood said the total acquisition 
cost was not yet known but the leading japanese financial journal 
nihon keizai shimbun today estimated the deal at about 1 billion 
in addition to companyowned 7eleven stores southlands six 
food processing centers and five distribution centers are also 
included in the deal 
independent licensees and affiliates also operate more than 
5900 7eleven stores in the united states and 21 foreign countries 
7eleven japan the largest conveniencestore operator in japan 
operates 3940 licensed stores itoyokado which southland 
described as japans most profitable supermarket chain owns 503 
percent of 7eleven japan southland has had a 17year affiliation 
with the japanese concerns 
suffering disappointing sales and earnings growth southland has 
been strained by debt associated with its 49 billion leveraged 
buyout in 1987 which gave dallas thompson family control of the 
chain 
for the nine months ended nov 30 1989 southland lost 299 
million on revenue of 63 billion the company attributed the loss 
to heavy interest payments and additional charges associated with 
the buyout 
southland said in november it faced a liquidity crisis to meet 
substantial debt payments last year the company sold off its 
halfownership of citgo petroleum corp which supplies many of its 
stores with gasoline 
southlands bank group has ordered the company to submit a 
restructuring plan by may 31 under terms outlined in the companys 
news release southland proposes to issue new bonds in exchange for 
outstanding bonds and issue additional common stock 
during the course of the last six months we have reviewed a 
broad range of alternatives that would maintain the longterm 
viability and success of southland said john p thompson 
southlands chairman 
we believe this strategic alliance is the best way to 
achieve the companys goals 
the deal caught some southland employees off guard johnny lacy 
who works at a 7eleven in the dallas suburb of farmers branch 
said he was confused by the announcement because the companys 
monthly newsletters have portrayed an increasingly fit firm 
this is strange he said i thought the thompsons were 
getting the company back on its feet from the newsletters it 
seemed like everything was going uphill 
itoyokado said it was approached by southland in late january 
to participate in the both the financing and management of the 
companys restructuring 
because of current friction over japanese investment in us 
companies masaaki kamata senior managing director of seveneleven 
japan stressed that the agreement was made in response to 
southlands request for assistance 
kamata said great care would be taken to explain the deal to 
political and financial leaders in the united states with an 
interest in the company 
masatoshi ito the chairman of 7eleven japan and president of 
itoyokado said he sees the deal as the beginning of a worldwide 
partnership 
as the world largest convenience store chain e will maintain 
and build upon our mutually strong market positions by combining 
the operating skills and strategic thinking of the american and 
japanese companies ito said 
another southland spokesman harris diamond said the japanese 
firm will be represented on the southland board of directors if the 
deal is completed 
the thompson family would retain about 15 percent of the company 
and would remain on the board the spokesman said 
there will be no layoffs and no store closings diamond 
said in fact we believe the 400 million cash infusion is going 
to be a tremendous asset 
thompson said the money will be used for improvements as well as 
advertising and promotion 
we believe this transaction is necessary to preserve the 
business weve built he said

the senate approached a showdown today over 
whether to provide aid to coal miners who lose their jobs because 
of new pollution controls and the outcome could determine whether 
a clean air bill passes this year 
the coal issue has placed two of the senates most powerful 
members at odds majority leader george mitchell dmaine and sen 
robert byrd dwva who was mitchells predecessor as senate 
leader and still wields immense power as chairman of the 
appropriations committee 
i expect that the coal miner issue will be resolved one way 
or another today said mitchell meeting with reporters before 
the senate resumed debate on the clean air bill 
no action on the amendment is expected until late in the day 
however 
byrd arguing for his proposal on the senate floor declared 
the coal miners are being asked to pay a very high price they 
will lose their livlihood 
byrd has been pressing an assistance program for miners in his 
state and elsewhere if they lose their jobs because of tougher acid 
rain controls at coalburning power plants in the midwest 
on wednesday night he offered to lower the packages expected 
cost from 700 million over four years to 500 million over three 
years 
byrds amendment offered nearly two weeks ago has threatened 
to derail progress in enacting the first improvements in federal 
air pollution controls in 13 years 
the white house vigorously opposes the assistance plan and 
mitchell is fearful its passage might cause the compromise clean 
air bill worked out in lengthy negotiations with the bush 
administration to unravel 
the miner aid issue was expected to come to a head today as 
mitchell tried to work out a compromise with the white house while 
byrd was likely to press for a vote on his amendment 
im not going to stand here and say ive got 51 votes needed 
for passage but i can tell you you dont have 51 votes either 
and i can tell you im very close byrd told mitchell during 
floor debate wednesday night 
while the senate has been considering a string of amendments on 
the floor the miner assistance program has been the hottest topic 
behind the scenes 
there has been intense lobbying by the white house to defeat the 
amendment and an administration source said wednesday that it has 
become less interested in seeking a compromise and was prepared to 
try to defeat the proposal 
mitchell and minority leader bob dole rkan meanwhile have 
been trying line up senators to vote against byrds proposal but a 
vote on the amendment was put off twice because its defeat was not 
certain 
offering his revised assistance proposal byrd complained that 
the white house was unwilling to negotiate and that he wanted a 
vote 
mitchell and dole said they expected a response shortly from the 
administration on a compromise assistance plan crafted by aides to 
mitchell that would include benefits to coal miners as well as 
other workers that could lose their jobs because of tougher 
pollution controls 
many senators have complained that if coal miners were to be 
given special assistance the same should be provided to workers in 
other industries 
the senate spent most of wednesday debating and then defeating a 
proposal aimed at tightening smog pollution controls in the 
nations cities 
the amendment which lost 5346 would have preserved the 
federal governments authority to impose air pollution reduction 
plans if states and localities failed to act 
it also sought to eliminate waivers for some industrial 
polluters if the controls were too expensive and would have 
broadened the smogreducing requirements to include smaller 
polluters 
earlier in the week the senate killed requirements for tighter 
automobile emissions controls and an expanded alternative fuels 
program to reduce urban smog 
the two proposals were singled out by environmentalists as being 
essential to assuring improved air quality in major cities 
earlier another strengthening proposal which would have required a 
reduction in toxic chemical emissions from automobiles fell by 
6533 
with the three defeats environmentalists said they planned to 
focus on the house where a clean air bill is still in committee 
in their attempt to strengthen curbs on smogcausing pollutants

grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade as traders 
ignored news of a new ussoviet grain deal and focused instead on 
weakness in the stock market 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 21 points at 
midmorning following a steep drop in the tokyo stock market

union that will increase the annual minimum shipments of us grain

under the current agreement 
under the agreement the soviets are committed to buy at least 
four million tons each of wheat and feed grains but moscow can 
substitute up to 750000 tons of one commodity for the other 
the deal was viewed as bullish for grain prices but was 
overshadowed by the sharp drop in stock prices 
if the stock market keeps going down theyre not going to pay 
any attention to the grain agreement said john frazier director 
of the agricultural division of gerald inc 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to cent lower 
with the contract for delivery in may at 358 a bushel corn was

total in five years and a sign the industry is recovering federal 
officials said 
the oil and gas business is starting to pick up a little

ninetyfive companies offered bids at wednesdays government 
lease sale 15 percent more than participated in the most recent 
comparable sale a year ago 
the bids totaled 5895 million for leases on 27 million acres 
of waterbottoms in louisiana mississippi and alabama bids likely 
to be accepted by the government came to 4274 million also the 
biggest since 1985 when winning bids totaled about 11 billion

the 25th floor of the south tower of the 
luxurious world financial center is empty save for a few boxes so 
are the 26th 27th and 28th floors 
in the booming mid1980s merrill lynch amp co expected to fill 
the space easily the nations largest securities firm booked two 
full towers in the ultramodern complex in lower manhattan that 
opened in 1986 using conservative estimates of employment growth 
then merrill scaled back to one tower plus about half the 
second after the 1987 stock market crash even that was too much 
and now the firm plans to sublet nine floors including the four 
undeveloped ones 
on wall street and broad street and greenwich street and 
battery place a securities industry recession has created an 
officespace glut in the worlds premier financial district 
vacancy rates are soaring in the maze of silver office towers 
and aging stone monoliths where stock trading began almost 200 
years ago under a buttonwood tree property brokers compare the 
slump to the mid1970s when new york teetered on bankruptcy 
were still headed south said robert fr ballard an 
executive vice president with the real estate firm cushman amp 
wakefield who has worked in the wall street building market since 
1959 we havent bottomed out yet 
manhattan real estate brokers say the vacancy rate in the 
downtown financial district is approaching 20 percent vs 8 
percent to 12 percent in 1985 during the securities industry boom 
put another way the 14 million square feet of available office 
space downtown equals three empty buildings each as big as a 
110story world trade center tower 
the glut is expected to worsen because hundreds of thousands of 
square feet to be abandoned by firms such as merrill shearson 
lehman hutton inc salomon inc and collapsed drexel burnham 
lambert inc havent been tallied yet 
unprecedented growth in stock trading and investment banking 
gave rise to handoverfist hiring and expansion by wall street 
firms in the 1980s 
average daily trading volume on the new york stock exchange shot 
up from 322 million shares in 1979 to 189 million shares in 1987 
while employment in in new yorks securities and commodities 
industries grew from 74 million to 163 million 
during that period wall street firms set ambitious expansion 
plans tied to the seemingly limitless possibilities of another 
boom building world headquarters seemed logical to accomodate 
technological advances that required more space for more computers 
for more trading into the 21st century 
many of the financial firms dont indulge in what we call 
intelligent strategic planning regarding their space needs said 
joel wechsler a managing director of the real estate firm edward 
s gordon amp co theyre getting a little more sophisticated in 
that area now 
stock market volume securities underwriting mergers and 
takeovers and other financial businesses are down sharply since 
the crash the securities industry has lost more than 40000 jobs 
the vacancy rates are directly related to the shrinkage in the 
financial services industry said anthony m saytanides edward 
s gordons chief operating officer 
ballard put it less gently the developers built too much 
space the tenants rented too much space the market took a 
nosedive 
during the decline several projects were abandoned and other 
overly ambitious ones have cost firms hundreds of millions of 
dollars salomon took a 150 million accounting charge against 
earnings after dropping out of a major project two firms that 
named buildings for themselves ef hutton amp co and thomson 
mckinnon securities inc are history 
shearson the no 2 brokerage behind merrill spent 450 million 
to build a 39story office tower known as shearson lehman hutton 
plaza the firm plans to fill the building which opened late last 
year but also is firing up to 5000 workers this year which could 
lead to more unused space 
workers in reduced shearson departments say they can roam floors 
almost undisturbed the firms new tower is adorned with a 
parthenonlike frieze and some wags say it too could wind up a 
monument to a golden age 
there may be some discussion in hindsight whether it was the 
most effective use of the firms money at the time a shearson 
official privately conceded adding that it is evaluating space 
needs as part of an overhaul 
merrill decided to move in the early 80s when its headcount 
was growing by 13 percent annually it booked the world financial 
center space anticipating only half that growth but since the 
crash merrill has slashed its work force back to a 1980 level 
more cuts are planned 
the firm took a 470 million charge against earnings last 
quarter for its restructuring 220 million to cover real estate 
commitments nearly all of that in new york 
the growth has certainly gone in the other direction 
merrill spokesman fred yager said our fixed costs have been 
reduced considerably and one of our biggest fixed costs is real 
estate 
for the real estate market the gluts the thing while modern 
office spaces such as the world financial center and world trade 
center complexes are almost fully occupied older buildings are 
bearing the brunt as firms move out 
the average asking rent downtown is falling but not in 
proportion to available space brokers say topline offices still 
command around 35 per square foot among the highest in the 
country some prices for older buildings though have fallen into 
the single digits just like in the 1970s 
brokers estimate the downtown vacancy rate will climb well above 
20 percent once a rash of moves some across new york waterways to 
cheaper brooklyn or new jersey are completed in the mid70s 
the rate was about 25 percent brokers said 
among the untallied moves the securities industry automation 
corps move to new quarters abandoning 200000 square feet 
salomons shift to 7 world trade center leaving 500000 square 
feet behind the consolidation by merrill and shearson and about 
15 million square feet by drexel 
during its junkbond driven heyday drexel planned to build new 
headquarters downtown the firm wisely scrapped the project after 
settling securities fraud charges with the government last april 
and trimming 4000 employees by selling its retail brokerage 
operations 
unwisely in retrospect drexel last fall extended the lease on 
its main broad street offices until 2004 six weeks ago drexels 
parent entered bankruptcy proceedings listing more than 470 
million in domestic lease commitments outstanding 
some brokers say the market has even further to fall because at 
least one sure sign of desperation has yet to take hold 
during the 70s a lot of the older buildings were turned into 
apartments ballard said that hasnt happened yet and if that 
hasnt happened we havent hit bottom

all the huffing and puffing against smoking has 
failed to blow tobaccos house down 
industry analysts say profits in the tobacco business are 
growing at a doubledigit clip due to higher prices improved 
production efficiency stable leaf costs and clever marketing they 
expect similar increases in the future 
but the antismoking drive could have an unintended side effect 
some media executives say newspapers and magazines will be hurt if 
new limits on tobacco advertising are adopted 
publishers planning new magazines for instance must consider 
in devising a business plan whether the magazine could survive if 
tobacco advertising were banned 
tobacco opponents say their chief goal has not been to make 
tobacco less profitable but to raise awareness of health issues and 
to puncture the glamorous image of smoking that some cigarette ads 
still promote 
results of their efforts are readily apparent smoking is 
prohibited on most domestic air flights and in many public places 
such as restaurants hospitals and offices one tobacco company 
withdrew plans to test a new cigarette aimed at blacks after 
disclosure of the plans stirred a barrage of complaints that it was 
preying on a minority group 
the segment of the adult population that smokes tumbled to 291 
percent in 1987 the most recent year for which such statistics are 
available from 407 percent in 1966 the us office on smoking 
and health says 
cigarette sales volume has also dropped steadily in recent years 
the tobacco institute a trade organization said cigarette 
shipments dropped to 562 billion in 1988 down 23 percent from 
1987 and 122 percent from the peak of 640 billion in 1984 
john c maxwell jr who follows the tobacco business for wheat 
first securities in richmond va estimates sales dropped by 61 
percent to 524 billion in 1989 he said the decline would have been 
half as large without unusual efforts by one company to reduce 
inventories held by wholesalers 
but the decline in sales volume and the percentage of smokers 
has not translated into a decline in cigarette revenue or profits 
the tobacco institute said domestic cigarette revenue reached a 
record 358 billion in 1988 up 65 percent from 1987 
tobacco company domestic pretax operating profits rose more than 
10 percent last year to 72 billion said industry watcher diana 
temple philip morris usa the industry leader with 419 percent of 
the market and the bestselling marlboro brand had an operating 
profit of 36 billion alone on revenue of 95 billion in 1989 
ms temple an analyst for the salomon brothers inc investment 
firm said the industry has reported an average 14 percent annual 
increase in operating profits over the past five years she said 
the dropoff in 1989 reflected the unusually large volume decline 
not antismoking efforts 
maxwell said the antismoking effort hasnt cut into tobacco 
profits and he forecast a continuation of doubledigit increases in 
operating profits for the forseeable future 
he said the tobacco companies have been able to overcome the 
impact of volume declines by raising prices as often as twice a 
year ms temple said an average pack of cigarettes cost 144 in 
1989 up 11 percent from 1988 
tobacco companies also have controlled costs by investing in 
machinery that produces nearly twice as many cigarettes a minute 
in addition domestic growers have been reluctant to raise raw leaf 
prices fearing cigarette makers will buy from foreign suppliers 
maxwell said 
analysts also said that despite the wellpublicized misstep in 
developing a new cigarette for blacks the tobacco companies have 
proven adept marketers who have been able to identify customers and 
tailor messages for them 
ms temple said tobacco companies also have grown more 
profitable because few have dared challenge the six leaders 
philip morris rj reynolds tobacco co brown amp williamson 
lorillard american brands and liggett group it is an 
unglamorous business that doesnt attract a lot of new entrants 
she said 
proposals to restrict tobacco advertising would not necessarily 
hurt profitability and could improve it analysts said 
maxwell said an ad ban would save money that would come right 
down to the bottom line for tobacco companies 
ms temple said the tobacco companies would probably shift ad 
spending to promotions such as distributing free samples 
sponsoring concerts or sports events or setting up more store 
displays 
federal trade commission figures show the tobacco companies 
spent 258 billion on advertising and promotions in 1987 
including 4135 million on advertising in newspapers and magazines 
a recent study by a group of advertisers media companies and 
advertising agencies said that by 1993 a ban on tobacco 
advertising could drive 165 magazines or 13 percent of the 
projected total of 12490 and 12 newspapers or 08 percent of the 
projected total of 1506 out of business 
it said prices would have to rise to compensate for lost ad 
revenue 
critics of the study said it failed to allow sufficiently for 
the possibility that other advertisers would fill the void left by 
tobacco ads just as occurred when tobacco ads were banned on radio 
and tv in 1971 
but the possibility that tobacco ads will be banned is already 
figuring into plans for new magazines 
michael klingensmith publisher of time warner incs monthold 
entertainment weekly said the magazine gets about 10 percent of 
its ad revenue from cigarette companies and supports the right to 
advertise a legal product 
but he said in drafting the magazines business plan he had to 
consider the possibility of a tobacco ad ban anybody launching a 
magazine today would have to consider that he said 
alan wragg publisher of tv time a new weekly tv listings 
magazine said he is counting on a much smaller contribution from 
cigarette advertising than if we were doing this five years ago

long banned from american airwaves the marlboro man still 
gallops across television screens in the philippines and other 
developing countries where us tobacco companies are selling more 
cigarettes than ever and lungcancer rates are soaring 
as the market shrinks at home the us government is helping 
american tobacco companies invade foreign markets particularly 
along the booming pacific rim 
in thailand where 65 percent of men over 20 smoke the us 
trade office is threatening sanctions unless import taxes and other 
barriers to american cigarettes are lowered 
health groups from nine asian countries sent a letter to 
president bush last year calling the threat a mockery of your 
countrys efforts to curb the export of other addictive drugs into 
your country 
billboards for marlboro and winston are common in bangkok 
despite a yearold law prohibiting all cigarette advertising thai 
health officials fear opening the door to us tobacco interests 
as south korea japan and taiwan did four years ago could mean a 
sharp increase in the number of teenage and female smokers 
my bottom line is antismoking said dr prakit 
vateesatokit of the thai antismoking campaign project i dont 
care if its thai or american cigarettes i see people die of 
smoking every day 
in hong kong where american cigarettes dominate 70 percent of 
the market lungcancer deaths increased 58 percent in the last 
decade and the number of teenage smokers is on the rise taiwanese 
antismoking advocates say 85 percent of young smokers whose ranks 
are being filled through american hardsell prefer imports 
smoking and lungcancer deaths are declining overall in some 
western european countries where health concerns mirror those in 
the united states 
in britain the heaviest smokers are bluecollar workers and 
people in their 20s but the number of teenage smokers is 
dropping they were the target of the government health education 
authoritys recent 165 million nosmoking campaign and an 
antismoking group called parents against tobacco 
young adults also are italys most avid smokers although 
smoking is declining overall the most recent statistics say 29 
percent of italians smoked in 1986 down from 35 percent in 1980 
the warning smoking is dangerous to your health is printed 
on all cigarette packs sold in argentina and uruguay but surveys 
say 68 percent of all men in uruguay and 32 percent of women smoke 
about 60 percent of the population of japan smokes and the 
admonition be careful not to smoke too much for your health in 
barely visible print on cigarette packs does little to counteract 
the impact of television advertising foreign actors such as james 
coburn and roger moore appear in ads promoting a glamorous image 
for smoking and japanese cigarette companies have taken a cue from 
their american counterparts by creating products for specific 
groups such as a brand for teenagers called dean after the late 
actor james dean a hero among japanese youth 
antismoking efforts have fared poorly in japan south korea and 
china where 250 million smokers follow their leaders puffing panda

at a recent meeting with video 
industry analysts blockbuster entertainment corp executives 
passed out free cinderella tapes 
the symbolism was subtle yet clear for those familiar with 
blockbusters chief who went from the unglamorous world of trash 
collection to the glitz of the movie industry and quickly 
transformed an obscure group of video stores into the nations top 
chain 
were not twice as smart we just work twice as hard said 
h wayne huizenga blockbuster chairman and chief executive 
officer weve only been at it for three years id say thats 
not too bad 
huizenga also is unabashedly upbeat about his latest venture 
professional sports earlier this month the 52yearold 
multimillionaire purchased a 15 percent share in the miami dolphins 
football team and a 50 percent stake in robbie stadium corp which 
operates the 75000seat home of the dolphins 
he predicts regularseason major league baseball will be played 
in miami before 1995 
there is no question well get a franchise someday in miami 
the question is how soon said huizenga theres no reason not 
to be optimistic 
huizenga resembles former new york mayor ed koch but doesnt 
copy kochs famous line how am i doin huizenga prefers to 
let numbers tell the story 
since huizenga purchased blockbuster for less than 19 million 
from a dallasbased video retailer the chain has grown from 19 to 
nearly 1200 outlets from guam to england at the present rate an 
average of one new blockbuster store opens a day and huizenga 
predicts sales could top 1 billion this year 
although blockbusters aggressive expansion has led to concern 
by some industry analysts huizenga believes the pace is 
manageable about 160 of the nearly 400 stores opened by 
blockbuster last year were companyowned the rest were franchise 
operators who need little if any help in getting started he said 
so thats really about one store every other day were 
directly responsible for its fast but not unreasonable said 
huizenga 
blockbusters fort lauderdale headquarters give only small hints 
of show business a glassencased ship model and leather chairs 
dominate the lobby of the spanishstyle building 
a small framed picture of president bush is signed to my 
video advisor nearby is a figurine of a teenage boy slumped in 
a chair hes watching a video 
for huizenga couch potatoes are generally sweet 
this is nothing like the trash business said huizenga if 
someone rents a movie and doesnt like it they blame hollyood not 
blockbuster there are very few problems with customers 
color television was still a novelty in the 1960s when huizenga 
took up a garbage collection route in fort lauderdale bringing in 
500 a week huizenga drove the truck and lugged the trash until 
the business grew 
meanwhile his uncles in chicago were doing well with their 
trash collection and salvage company 
the two merged and in 1971 put up the first public stock 
offering of waste management inc last year the company reported 
revenue of 45 billion 
although waste management is based in chicago huizenga would 
return each weekend to fort lauderdale where he had moved as a 
high school freshman 
when he left the company in 1984 he began a number of ventures 
ranging from a bottled water service to dry cleaning he still 
operates a helicopter fleet that picks up cash from atop banks 
the rapid expansion of blockbuster began almost immediately 
after huizengas 1987 acquisition blockbusters national presence 
was boosted by the january 1989 purchase of las vegasbased major 
video corps 175 stores 
now blockbuster is experimenting with huge video warehouses in 
former supermarket sites in atlanta one store features a 
basketball hoop in the back for kids the company prohibits xrated 
videos 
huizenga who foresees up to 3000 blockbuster stores in the 
united states believes the companys most promising frontier lies 
overseas blockbuster has 15 stores in the united kingdom 42 in 
canada and is negotiating for franchises in other european 
countries and australia 
i dont see any reason we cant compete in asia and south 
america and anywhere people have vcrs he said entertainment 
is a universal commodity 
but some analysts wonder about blockbusters rapid growth last 
may blockbuster stock fell following the release of a report by 
bear stearns amp co inc that blockbuster artificially inflated its 
financial statements by writing off the costs of tapes over three 
years rather than nine months 
blockbuster has reported more than 100 percent increases in 
earnings for two consecutive years in 1989 blockbuster revenue 
was up 133 percent to 663 million and net income rose 153 percent 
to 442 million 
with the baseball pay negotiations settled huizenga said he and 
several other south florida corporate leaders will begin their own 
talks on how best to lure the major leagues to joe robbie stadium 
which would need about 10 million in renovations to accomodate 
baseball 
one option said huizenga is to acquire an existing team at 
present prices huizengas stock in blockbuster and waste 
management is worth about 308 million giving him considerable 
financial muscle as a potential buyer 
however hed settle for bidding on an expansion club already 
cities such as st petersburg buffalo and jacksonville are far 
ahead of miami on lobbying the league for a new team 
if we dont get it on the first round then during the next 
expansion said huizenga we havent spoken with anyone 
offically yet about anything the only thing we have going for us 
at this point is our drive and enthusiasm

florida attorney general bob 
butterworth said thursday he would intervene in a lawsuit filed by 
texas billionaire robert m bass over dividends paid to the poynter 
institute a media center that runs the st petersburg times and 
other publications 
basss attempt to obtain dividends paid to the institute 
butterworth said has the potential to disrupt its funding he said 
he was getting involved because he has the constitutional athority 
to protect the integrity of charitable interests 
andrew barnes editor and president of the times institute 
chairman and chairman and chief executive officer of the times 
holding co and times publishing co issued a statement saying he 
welcomed butterworths move 
a spokesman for the bass group questioned the states action 
we are puzzled by the attorney generals announcement said 
david bonderman a general partner in the bass venture 
our longstanding request that times management act fairly and 
in accordance with its legal obligations poses absolutely no threat 
to the continuing survival of the poynter institute nor would our 
request in any way interfere with the services provided by the 
institute to public high schools and universities or florida 
residents he added 
butterworth said he would seek to stop an effort by 
poynterjamison ventures ltd an investor partnership controlled 
by bass to obtain dividends now paid to the nonprofit journalism 
institute 
the poynter institute is unique to florida and has served our 
public high schools and universities as well as numerous florida 
residents butterworth said it is important to florida public 
policy to protect charitable institutions from attack by 
profiteers 
the partnership includes the nieces of the late eleanor poynter 
jamison sister of founder nelson poynter it has made a 270 
million buyout offer for times publishing co parent firm of the 
newspaper congressional quarterly and other magazines 
the bass group owns 40 percent of the voting stock of times 
publishing co that organization under the complex stock 
arrangement set up by nelson poynter is in turn controlled by the 
times holding co which is controlled by the poynter institute 
bass maintains it wants a better return on its investment while 
times publishing defends the current stock arrangement as 
beneficial to the journalistic standards of the newspaper and the 
health of the poynter institute which offers education and 
national conferences to journalists and students

first came the trinkets and toys then the 
cameras cars computers and electronics now japan is ready to 
take on a remaining bastion of american economic dominance the 
credit card 
jcb international credit card co ltd the largest japanese 
credit card company is expanding aggressively in the united states 
and plans to peddle the card to american consumers beginning this 
summer 
the effort has jolted us card companies which are watching 
jcb with a mix of awe curiosity and fear 
at first jcb officials say the card will be offered primarily 
to us individuals such as business people who travel extensively 
in the far east where jcb is the most widely accepted plastic 
they say the card is not intended for a broader us audience but 
arent ruling out that possibility 
i frankly dont see jcb as a mass card in this country said 
dwayne krumme head of jcbs american operation based in los 
angeles i think the jcb card will be niche card at least in the 
early years 
krumme who formerly ran the credit card business of los 
angelesbased first interstate bancorp said jcb has held 
preliminary discussions with at least three banks in the midwest 
and east about issuing jcb cards in the same way banks issue visa 
and mastercard 
he declined to identify the banks but said we think we can 
work something out with them 
jcb already is issuing corporate cards to us businesses and 
has negotiated deals with creditcard processing companies for 
repayment services in is accepted by a growing number of american 
merchants from hotels and airlines to swank retailers eager to 
encourage spending by wealthy japanese tourists and business people 
the jcb card in an international context is really a travel 
and entertainment card said krumme when its used for other 
purposes its an upscale card used at tiffanys chanel and 
guccis 
at least 300000 american outlets are expected to accept jcb 
cards soon double the present number jcb officials say 
worldwide jcb is accepted by 14 million merchants triple the 
number of five years ago 
jcbs effort to muscle into the us market comes as credit card 
companies already are competing intensely jcbs entry also 
reflects japans seemingly inexhaustible financial might an 
advantage that some rivals find intimidating 
we think jcb is going to be one of the major competitive 
threats of the 90s said richard woods a spokesman for 
mastercard international accepted by about 8 million merchants 
worldwide 
they have deep pockets theyre longterm players theres no 
question they have an interest in providing global payment 
services woods said were watching them very closely 
visa international accepted by 75 million merchants worldwide 
also is monitoring jcbs forays said spokesman richard brancoli 
but he suggested jcb should be watching its own backyard 
there are 25 million japanese who have visa cards brancoli 
said we expect it to increase to 40 million in japan 
jcb stands for japan credit bureau founded three decades ago by 
sanwa bank one of japans largest commercial banks jcb is the 
oldest and predominant credit card company in japan with about 70 
million cards issued 
the cards biggest threat may be to the american express card 
both are charge cards targeted mainly to the same market of 
affluent consumers users must pay their balance in full each month 
visa mastercard and the discover card issued by retailing 
giant sears roebuck amp co are revolving credit cards targeted to 
a much wider income range of consumers users do not have to pay 
their full balance but are charged interest on the unpaid portion 
steven richardson vice president of travelrelated services at 
american express said he didnt consider the jcb card a 
significant threat and noted that in japan both card companies 
have a partnership arrangement nonetheless he said we 
obviously look at any new developments in the industry and consider 
them all seriously 
creditcard experts speculated that american express accepted 
by 3 million merchants worldwide is looking hard at ways to learn 
more about the competition 
obviously the american market is an attractive place said 
bruce brittain head of brittain associates inc an atlantabased 
consulting firm that does market research on creditcard use 
theyre targeting people with the big bucks 
so far jcbs only us offices are in los angeles chicago san 
francisco and new york they are seeking to increase the us 
merchantacceptance base but also operate as travel centers to 
help japanese cardholders much like american express does abroad 
for its clients 
mitsuo funayama new york branch manager said any rival fears 
of a japanese assault were unfounded 
im sure jcb wont be so big in this country he said

analysts said the new york market was ripe for a pullback after 
its recent advance and the japanese debacle exacerbated wall 
streets retreat 
the market was overextended said monte gordon vice 
president and director of research at dreyfus corp you would 
expect the market to retrace 
last week the dow jones average of 30 industrials gained a net 
5789 points to 274122 its highest level since early january 
the advance continued on monday as the bluechip barometer picked 
up another 1441 points but it stalled in tuesdays trading and

the blimpie chain of submarine sandwich shops 
said thursday it soon will serve only tuna said to be caught in 
ways that do not seriously threaten dolphins 
blimpies new policy states that no store will purchase any tuna 
unless it is deemed dolphinsafe caught by means posing only 
minimal risk to the marine mammals 
but an environmental group said it advocates a boycott of all 
canned tuna because it knows of no brand available in the united 
states containing only dolphinsafe tuna 
blimpie which says its 350 franchised shops served 4 million 
tuna sandwiches last year will not purchase yellowfin tuna the 
type associated most closely with harm to dolphins 
anthony conza president and cofounder of blimpies said the 
company began working on the tunadolphin issue when it was raised 
by various environmental and animal rights groups 
we believe that the fast food consumer will support our 
decision to take an environmentally responsible stance he said 
blimpie decided against an outright boycott in part because 
consumers enjoy tuna sandwiches 
tuna is a lowfat highprotein food that is highly 
recommended by nutritionists and wellliked by our consumers 
conza said it is not our responsibility to make the decision for 
the consumer on whether or not to boycott tuna 
food distributors have assured blimpie that the policy will be 
followed the company said most of the stores which operate in 16 
states will become part of the program by the summer 
blimpie already serves skip jack tuna from the philippines in 60 
of its southeastern stores and in 28 of its houston locations 
yellowfin tuna one of the most commonly used varieties are 
caught with the involuntary help of dolphins schools of yellowfin 
swim below dolphins so tuna fleets mainly off the coasts of 
southern california and south america search out dolphins to 
locate yellowfin the dolphins often are injured or killed as the 
yellowfin are caught 
dolphins supposedly do not swim with skip jack tuna 
we do applaud the efforts but right now we are focusing on a 
canned tuna boycott said brenda killian a national organizer of 
the save the dolphins project of san franciscobased earth island 
institute we are in support of any restaurants that are looking 
for dolphinsafe tuna and if indeed distributors can guarantee it 
we would like to know

eastern airlines and its pilots union have agreed 
to an interim contract calling for a 25 percent wage cut and 
benefit concessions the company announced thursday 
the pact did not resolve the issue of rehiring more of the 
pilots who engaged in a sympathy strike with the machinists union 
in march 1989 
eastern also insisted it needs twice the amount of concessions 
given in the interim pact by the time the contract expires on july 
1 to successfully emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
time to resolve the dispute regrettably has just about run 
out in light of the reorganization timetable said thomas j 
matthews senior vice president of human resources for eastern 
which is owned by texas air corp 
eastern insisted federal mediators would have to continue 
efforts to reach a permanent agreement to cut costs further 
if expedited mediation is not successful in leading to such an 
arrangement eastern will have to promptly seek bankruptcy 
court permission to achieve full cost reductions on a longterm 
basis the carrier said in a news release 
the interim cut applies to easterns approximately 850 pilots 
still being paid at the prestrike wage rate of about 72000 
eastern had 3600 union pilots who honored picket lines when the 
machinists went on strike on march 4 1989 since then many pilots 
have returned replacements have been hired at lower wages and the 
airline has sold many routes 
edward breen spokesman for the eastern air line pilots 
association contended the company intends to use the temporary 
agreement negotiated with the help of the national mediation 
board as a device to crush the union 
he said that by demanding more concessions in advance eastern 
hoped to push the talks into a final impasse 
breen said alpa executives had agreed in principle to the 
contract but it would not be signed until after a formal vote of 
the master executive committee on saturday in washington 
the 25 percent wage cuts exclude about 950 replacement pilots 
hired at an average 27500 when the strike began 
the new wage levels are among the lowest in the country for 
major carriers breen said 
an eastern pilot after this will make about 50 percent of what 
a united airlines pilot makes and they still cant make a 
profit he said 
eastern lost 2826 million in the last quarter of 1989 
bringing total losses for the year to 8523 million overall 
houstonbased texas air lost 8856 million 
the interim agreement also calls for a reduction in the 
airlines contribution to the pilots pension plan increased pilot 
contributions to their medical and dental insurance and the 
preservation of tougher work rules in effect since the strike 
easterns alpa contract expired in june 1988 but its provisions 
had remained in effect federal mediators have guided negotiations 
since september although eastern said the two sides have been 
consulting regularly for 33 months 
under easterns reorganization plan pilots will have to reduce 
their wages and benefits to the same degree as other employees 
matthews said

a federal judge on thursday delayed accepting a 
guilty plea from general development corp and ordered an 
independent expert to review a plan to monitor the company and 
repay thousands of people allegedly overcharged for its homes 
us district judge lenore nesbitt gave conditional acceptance 
to guilty pleas from the miamibased home builder and two former 
executives pending review of presentencing reports 
general development former president robert ehrling and former 
chairman david brown were named last week in a 16count indictment 
alleging a sevenyear scheme to sell overvalued homes at its nine 
florida communities 
the indictment claims the company priced homes well above 
comparable residences in florida and kept prospective buyers from 
learning about the difference most of the general development 
customers were northeast and midwest residents brought to florida 
on heavily subsidized trips 
reading from prepared statements in court both ehrling and 
brown apologized and admitted their knowledge of the pricehike 
scheme the company allegedly sold 10000 overpriced homes for 850 
million from 1982 to 1989 
i am truly sorry i did not take action sooner and im sorry 
for the customers who were misled said brown 
under the plea agreement with federal prosecutors the two 
executives and the company would plead guilty to one fraud count 
while the 15 additional counts would be dismissed charges against 
gdv financial corp a general development subsidiary that provided 
mortgages and financial aid to homeowners would be dropped said 
assistant us attorney norman moscowitz 
if ms nesbitt accepts the guilty pleas from brown 49 and 
ehrling 50 each could face up to five years in prison a 250000 
fine and restitution payments sentencing is scheduled for may 22 
brown and ehrling were making 600000 a year each before they 
were forced out by general development directors march 9 after the 
company disclosed it was facing indictment 
general developments estimated 100 million 25year 
restitution program is detailed in a civil consent decree that 
prosecutors expect to file within the next week 
ms nesbitt said she wants an expert perhaps a former trustee 
of a dissolved corporation to review the consent decree for its 
feasibility 
i dont want to accept something now and be locked in she 
said 
a hearing on the consent decree is scheduled for april 3 
the company also could face a maximum 500000 fine for its 
guilty plea 
in court moscowitz said general development priced its homes an 
average of 40 percent higher than market value and lot prices were 
inflated by up to 10 times up to half of the general development 
homebuyers were from the new york metropolitan area he said 
the indictment also alleges general development kept customers 
from learning about other homes prices in florida by assigning a 
sales representatives to stay with the people constantly and even 
to screen their calls in some cases 
the 35yearold company has sold or has available 350000 lots 
in florida and also operates a timeshare resort near walt disney 
world a recreational community in tennessee and 10 timeshare 
resorts in the west 
general development recently laid off 5500 workers about 10 
percent of its work force and shut sales offices in hollywood 
fla and boston 
the company is also the target of several classaction suits 
involving thousands of homebuyers alleging overpricing 
in delaware chancery court a general development shareholder 
filed suit last week seeking a court order to nominate three 
candidates to the board of directors in may and three others in 
1991 
general development claims new yorkbased united capital corp 
which owns about 127 percent of its outstanding shares missed the 
filing deadline for this years corporate elections and that 
directors can appoint people to the 1991 vacancies 
the delaware suit alleges brown persuaded united capital 
chairman attilio petrocelli to sign a letter dropping the proxy 
slate in exchange for permission to acquire up to 20 percent of 
general development stock but brown failed to disclose the 
companys financial problems and the pending indictments the suit 
alleges 
the suit seeks to nullify the agreement and restore united 
capitals proxy slate

the italian senate on thursday passed a bill that 
would restrict ownership of television and newspapers and ban 
commercials during film opera and theater productions on 
television 
the measure is seen as a major threat to the television empire 
of italian media tycoon silvio berlusconi 
the bill approved by a show of hands in the senate must be 
considered next week by the chamber of deputies the lower house of 
parliament 
the tv law would prevent those who own more than 16 percent of 
italys total newspaper circulation from owning a television 
station those who control from 8 percent to 16 percent of the 
circulation would be restricted to just one television station and 
those who own up to 8 percent of the circulation could own two 
stations someone who does not own a newspaper could own up to 
three television stations 
italy is the only european nation without a law regulating 
television ownership 
under the bill berlusconi could be forced to give up one of his 
three tv stations or his newspapers 
the rome daily la repubblica which berlesconi controls through 
his acquisition of mondadori editore estimated he could lose up to 
320 million a year in advertising if the amendment on commercials 
passes 
gianni letta a spokesman for berlusconis holding company 
fininvest said wednesday that approval of the amendment would 
mean the end of commercial television in italy to the advantage of 
a monopoly by staterun rai 
the staterun television carries advertising but mainly between

southland corp with its announcement thursday 
that it was selling out to a japanese firm became the latest 
company forced to seek outside help after being swamped by 
leveraged buyout debt 
the parent of 7000 7eleven convenience stores said it was 
selling a controlling interest to itoyokado co ltd japans 
secondlargest supermarket operator and a partner in the 49 
billion buyout of southland in 1987 for 400 million and the 
assumption of southlands debt 
southland joined the growing ranks of companies such as campeau 
corp revco ds inc and doskocil cos that were unable to handle 
the large debt bills run up in takeover deals 
their stories have common elements a debtfinanced buyout made 
during the rosy days of the 1980s takeover binge disappointing 
sales and earnings that cant support massive interest payments 
assets put up for sale to bring in desperatelyneeded cash 
economists are predicting that as time goes on more companies 
will find themselves in similar straits especially if the already 
slowing economy takes a downturn 
finding an outside investor as southland has done is one 
option a struggling company has for getting out of trouble the 
infusion of cash and assumption of debt brings an immediate end to 
the financial crisis but the price in this case a loss of 
corporate control can be high 
for other companies including revco campeau and doskocil 
the answer has been bankruptcy court protection 
revco one of the countrys biggest drugstore chains went 
private in a 15 billion junk bondfinanced buyout in 1986 it was 
the first big leveraged buyout to fail and revco is selling 
hundreds of stores as it reorganizes 
campeau was unable to handle a 7 billion debt load after buying 
allied stores corp and federated department stores inc again 
with highinterest junk bond financing when news of the companys 
troubles broke in september it set off a plunge in the junk bond 
market and helped bring the debtfinanced takeover boom to an end 
campeau placed the store businesses in bankruptcy court in 
january 
doskocil a food processing company defaulted on a 133 million 
loan after taking over the much larger wilson foods corp doskocil 
has been unable to find a buyer for assets it has tried to sell 
and the higher prices it has been forced to pay for raw materials 
has left it short of cash 
the company sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
earlier this month 
all of these companies when they went heavily into debt 
indicated they could handle the payments but the economy has 
slowed profits have fallen and interest rates have moved higher 
leaving some highlyleveraged operations in a bind 
retailers have been particularly vulnerable as several of tese 
firms illustrate the retail industry has been in a slump for 
several years and an expected improvement never materialized what 
looked like a great investment two years ago is todays bad deal 
some economists have warned the economy eventually could run 
into trouble because of highlyleveraged businesses 
companies that do business with financiallydistressed concerns 
may find they arent being paid for merchandise they have shipped 
or arent receiving as many orders they may have to cut back and 
possibly lay off workers as a result 
furthermore a company strapped by debt could be limited in its 
ability to compete and might lose market share to other concerns 
including foreign businesses a drop in market share means less 
demand for a companies products which also can mean lost jobs

shawmut national corp has revised its 1989 
earnings after an examination by federal bank regulators posting a 
129 million loss for the year instead of a previously announced 
200 million profit 
the bank revised its fourthquarter statement to reflected a 
327 million loss instead of a 39 million profit it also 
announced wednesday that it had lowered its dividend per share to 
25 cents from 36 cents 
the revision was another sign of the troubles facing banks 
because of the slumping real estate market examinations of real 
estate lending led to a 11 billion loss at bank of new england 
corp earlier this year 
investors seemed unconcerned by shawmuts move which could be 
viewed as protecting the bank against future problems shawmut 
stock gained 37 cents thursday to close at 1525 in new york 
stock exchange trading 
shawmut one of new englands largest banking companies said 
bad loans for the fourth quarter jumped sharply to 1234 million 
from 464 million 
after the review by federal regulators shawmut which is based 
in boston and hartford and has more than 400 branches said it 
nearly doubled the size of its reserves for loan losses at the end 
of 1989 to 739 million from 383 million 
bank examiners convinced shawmut to post the loss shawmut had 
called in 180 examiners from three federal agencies in a 
confidencebuilding effort after federal officials gave both bank 
of new england and bank of boston poor marks 
examinations of new england banks have drawn fire with bank 
officials accusing the examiners of being excessively harsh after 
failing to nip the savings and loan crisis in the bud 
shawmut chairman and chief executive officer joel alvord said 
the examiners had not changed the regulations but were calling 
the plays a little tighter 
when you see clouds on the horizon you carry an umbrella 
alvord said we may see showers but others might see storm 
clouds or a torrential downpour 
shawmut also said it expected a 40 million firstquarter 1990 
profit but that the figured would include 56 million in onetime 
gains and tax benefits 
news of the revision prompted both standard and poors corp and 
fitch investors service inc to lower their credit ratings of the 
banks senior debt issues to take the greater risk into account

a change of corporate culture is in store for 
michael hallman who is trading the presidency of boeing computer 
services for the same job at microsoft corp 
boeing is nearing its 75th anniversary microsoft was founded in 
the mid1970s boeing deals with everything from fax machines to 
fluid dynamics models microsoft focuses on computer software 
boeing has airplane models expected to be in development or use 
for 50 to 70 years the software industry has to react to sudden 
market changes 
its going to be a fun place to work hallman said in an 
interview tuesday its a place where you can work hard be 
successful and have fun doing it 
hallman 44 was named earlier this week by bill gates 
microsofts 34yearold billionaire chairman and chief executive 
to succeed jon a shirley who retires june 30 hallman will join 
microsoft april 2 
hallman who also will be chief operating officer described his 
new job as overseeing daytoday operations while company founder 
gates provides overall product and development direction 
the key he said will be to help microsoft cope with the 
realities that rapid growth and large size create but at the same 
time ensure theres the entrepreneurial spirit and environment that 
has kept the creativity flowing there 
microsoft has about 5000 employees and is expected to hit 1 
billion in sales in 1990 its operating system software for ibm 
personal computers and compatibles is the industry standard 
microsoft also leads in applications software such as word 
processing programs and programming languages 
at boeing computer services hallman directed about 13000 
employees and a boeing co division that does more than 1 billion 
in business a year 
about twothirds of the divisions work is for boeing but 
selling computer time and its expertise in data management and 
telecommunications brought about 360 million in sales last year 
bcs handles information management for all boeing divisions 
writes software and develops technologies such as artificial 
intelligence and computeraided design and manufacturing 
it operates about 13 billion worth of computer gear including 
a stateoftheart cray supercomputer it also has one of the 
worlds largest private telecommunications networks linking six 
major data centers nationwide 
and its customers include large corporations and the federal 
government the sort microsoft also would like 
i think thats an area where my background would lend itself 
well hallman said 
besides selling to such customers hallman also brings the 
perspective of an individual computer operator he has three in 
his home and a large corporate computer user boeing computer 
was in charge of acquiring the companys 43000 personal computers 
and the software for them 
hallman does not foresee microsoft switching its emphasis on 
desktop computers used by individuals and small businesses but he 
said the 1990s will see more personal computers linked in networks 
and with large mainframes microsofts products will need to 
reflect that he said 
hallman joined boeing three years ago after spending 20 years at 
international business machines corp much of that in sales and 
marketing he ran boeing computers outside sales until he was 
named president in november 1987 
microsoft spokesman marty taucher said hallmans compensation 
would be comparable to that of shirley who made 315000 a year 
according to microsofts 1989 proxy statement 
hallman said he was approached by microsoft about the 
presidents job last fall with contact accelerating after shirley 
formally announced his retirement earlier this year 
in recent weeks hallman said he spent a lot of time with gates 
and other microsoft senior executives discussing the job and 
making sure the chemistry was right 
bill and i get along great hallman said i think the 
facts are we share the same enthusiasm and passion and vision for 
where this technology is going to go 
hallman added that the change in corporate history and style 
from boeing to microsoft would be an advantage it would be a 
mistake to bring someone in who had exactly the same view because 
no value would be added there he said

percent or 907253 points

a jury on thursday acquitted exxon 
valdez skipper joseph hazelwood of being drunk and reckless in 
connection with the nations worst oil spill but convicted him of a 
minor charge of negligent discharge of oil 
after deliberating for just 10 hours the jurors absolved 
hazelwood of one felony and two misdemeanor counts stemming from 
the disaster in which his tanker ran aground spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of oil into prince william sound on march 24 1989 
the misdemeanor charge on which he was convicted carries a 
maximum sentence of 90 days in jail and a 1000 fine far less 
than the 7 years and 61000 fine he could have faced if found 
guilty on all four charges 
there were bursts of applause in the court room as superior 
court judge karl johnstone read the first three verdicts of not 
guilty 
johnstone said he would set a sentencing date later in the day 
hazelwoods new york lawyer michael chalos a former classmate 
of hazelwoods at the maritime academy at fort schuyler ny 
clapped the skipper on the shoulder and hit the counsel table with 
his hand at the first not guilty verdict 
the normally taciturn defendant smiled broadly for the first 
time in the twomonthlong trial and commented briefly to 
reporters saying only im just relieved i was nervous 
we think its a great victory for captain hazelwood chalos 
said we had great faith in the jury system the only charge hes 
been convicted of is a lowlevel misdemeanor 
one of the jurors said he found unbelievable the prosecutions 
complicated effort to prove hazelwood was intoxicated through 
backward calculations the skippers blood was not tested until 
long after the disaster and juror jeff sage said he and the other 
panelists figured out that from the prosecution experts 
calculations the captain would have had to consume an enormous 
amount of liquor before his ship ran aground 
if hazelwoods an average joe and you figured backwards the 
way he said its clear hed have to be dead from the alcohol 
sage said 
the jury felt there were just too many variables to pinpoint 
whether he was drunk at all sage said but he said the panel 
concluded that hazelwood was negligent to leave the bridge of his 
ship during an icy transit 
to this day were never going to know exactly what caused the 
accident sage said but he found no fault in the states 
decision to try the skipper on criminal charges 
i think that someone had to be tried he said and hes 
the captain he was in charge 
after a year of accusations against faceless villains exxon 
and oilrelated agencies the hazelwood trial provided a human 
side to the exxon valdez calamity focusing on frailties of captain 
and crew 
although 150 civil suits were filed and exxon was indicted in 
federal court hazelwood was the only individual charged 
criminally his lawyers complained he was a scapegoat in a 
disaster with many culprits 
his trial in anchorage superior court had the elements of an 
engrossing sea story with a dark subplot involving liquor troubled 
crew members and a starcrossed captain whose battles with the 
bottle were well known 
but the skipper who had been painted as a liquor swigging 
brigand turned out to be a quiet figure intent on nothing more 
than blending into the woodwork he sat back stroking his beard 
while others addressed the trials key questions was the skipper 
drunk on duty and was he reckless to leave the ships bridge 
whether hazelwood was drunk when his ship grounded remained a 
muddled issue because authorities failed to do a timely blood 
alcohol test when they got around to it 10 hours after the 
grounding hazelwood had a 061 alcohol reading lower than the 
alaska standard of 10 for drunken driving 
a prosecution expert witness tried to calculate backward and 
concluded that hazelwood had a blood alcohol reading of 14 when 
the ship grounded but defense experts ridiculed the figures as 
nonsense saying results could not be conclusive because there 
was too long a wait before the test and too many variables 
including whether hazelwood drank after the grounding 
hazelwood who chose not to testify never explained 
in six weeks of testimony witnesses came forward to tell what 
they knew of the day the exxon valdez and hazelwood sailed into 
history 
it was the thursday before good friday and the tanker had 
pulled into its namesake port of valdez to pick up a load of oil 
hazelwood went ashore for lunch with two crew members and a local 
pilot they remember that he sipped iced tea then they separated 
to do shopping 
later in the day the hour remained in dispute hazelwood met 
with his pals at the pipeline club a bar where they said he drank 
three vodkas in about three hours a woman patron of the club wife 
of a coast guard investigator in the case placed hazelwood there 
much earlier drinking for seven hours but her testimony never was 
corroborated 
on the way back to the ship the men stopped and bought pizza 
for the crew and hazelwood had another drink either beer or vodka 
when they arrived at the valdez terminal about 820 pm they 
learned that the sailing time originally set for 10 pm had been 
moved up to 9 pm the prosecution would maintain that hazelwoods 
tardiness in boarding his ship showed recklessness 
was the skipper intoxicated he showed no signs of it during 
the trial not a single witness said he appeared drunk 
did he stagger defense attorneys would ask did he slur 
his words inevitably the answers were no 
pilot william murphy who guided the tanker through the valdez 
narrows said he noticed a trace of alcohol on hazelwoods breath 
after a halfhour on the bridge he said the skipper went below and 
remained there for an hour when murphy left the ship at about 
1030 pm he conferred with hazelwood i reminded him there was 
ice reported ahead 
the crucial period recounted repeatedly in testimony began at 
1153 pm when hazelwood decided to leave the bridge in control of 
third mate gregory cousins after discussing maneuvers that would 
take the exxon valdez out of shipping lanes to avoid ice then turn 
back to the lanes before leaving prince william sound 
he asked if i felt comfortable with what we were going to do 
and i said yes recalled cousins he said do you feel 
comfortable enough that i can go below and get rid of some 
paperwork i said i felt very comfortable 
the prosecution would note that cousins did not have the special 
endorsement hazelwood had for piloting in prince william sound a 
license the defense claimed was mere formality and had been waived 
by the coast guard 
at the helm was robert kagan a seaman who had problems with 
steering in the past many witnesses would blame kagan for ramming 
the oilfilled tanker into a charted reef 
cousins said he ordered kagan to make a 10degree right rudder 
turn a routine order but he failed to check until it was too late 
to see if the turn had been made by then the exxon valdez was 
steaming toward bligh reef 
ten minutes after hazelwood left the bridge cousins glanced at 
the rudder indicator and i could tell we hadnt turned i 
think mr kagan didnt really understand the command 
cousins called hazelwood in his cabin 
i told him that we were getting into serious trouble 
the third mate recalled that was then we suffered the first 
shock and we were hard aground 
deep holes were gashed in the ships underbelly it was impaled 
on a rock the size of a volkswagen and warm oil was bubbling into 
the cold clear waters of prince william sound in all the ship 
belched out nearly 11 million gallons of alaska north slope crude 
oil in a hemorrhage that killed countless birds fish and wildlife 
on the richly populated sound the rocky shore turned black for 
hundreds of miles 
one issue which consumed half the trial was whether hazelwood 
in the frantic moments after grounding tried to drive his ship off 
the reef he denied it but prosecutors tried to show he risked 
capsizing the tanker and killing the crew 
the issue became moot when the defense proved the ship was 
immovable and the judge agreed hazelwood could not be convicted of 
trying something that was impossible

the state of connecticut on thursday 
joined with striking workers managers and private investors to buy 
the firearms division of colt industries giving the 154yearold 
gunmaker new life after a bitter fouryear strike 
state treasurer francisco l borges said the state would put up 
25 million from pension funds for a 47 percent stake in a newly 
created company to be called colts manufacturing company 
let me emphasize that this is a carefully thought out 
carefully structured potentially very profitable business 
venture borges said the states participation is not a 
bailout not a handout and not a subsidy 
union members whitecollar workers and investors also will hold 
stakes in the company which colt industries decided to sell in 
order to concentrate on its larger aerospace automotive and 
industrial services businesses 
the new companys first official act was to write a check for 
10 million in back pay for 1050 workers who had been on strike 
since jan 24 1986 about 50 striking workers applauded when the 
company produced the check at a news conference in borges office 
under terms of the buyout the company will pay a total of 13 
million in back wages to settle an unfair labor practices lawsuit 
brought by the united auto workers union against colt industries in 
the wake of the strike 
strikers will be put back to work based on seniority in 
addition to back pay they will receive a 13 percent wage increase 
and a stock plan that will allow united auto workers members to own 
115 percent of the stock in the new company 
in return for the back pay the uaw dropped its lawsuit against 
colt industries for unfair labor practices 
the national labor relations board said the settlement was the 
largest in its 55year history topping a 12 million settlement in 
1979 to chemical plant workers in westwego la 
salaried workers will own about 12 percent of the shares in 
colts manufacturing while the investor group cf holding corp 
will own about 12 percent said antony autorino chairman of cf 
holding corp 
colt industries put the firearms division up for sale 11 months 
ago at the time the division was ravaged by a threeyearold 
strike and had just lost the contract to produce m16 rifles for 
the us department of defense 
with no buyer in sight the striking workers won a major victory 
in september 1989 when an nlrb administrative law judge ruled the 
strike was caused by colts unfair labor practices the judge 
ordered the company to reinstate the workers and pay them lost 
wages estimated as high as 40 million 
in november cf holding announced it had agreed to buy the 
firearms division there was no mention at the time of union or 
state participation although both were expected to be part of a 
final agreement 
borges said thursday his office had fully investigated the 
firearms division and the firearms industry and concluded the 
business was a good investment for the state 
borges said he knew of no other instance in which labor 
management and public and private investors joined to preserve a 
company as big as colts firearms division 
he described the deal as a bold exciting and very inventive 
partnership in the best tradition of samuel colts entrepreneurial 
spirit 
colt was founded in 1836 in hartford by samuel colt inventor of 
the first successful repeating pistol after colts death in 1862 
the company developed the sixshooter that almost every cowboy 
carried the legendary gun that won the west 
in addition to the m16 the standard armyissue rifle colt 
makes the colt 45 handgun the king cobra magnum revolver and the 
ar15 rifle

they couldnt get it out 
the strike against southern peru copper is threatening to

general motors corps new line of three minivans 
was dumped into the incentive pool for the first time thursday as 
the automaker offered 1000 in cash rebates on the vehicles 
gm officials said the frontwheeldrive minivans sold as the 
chevrolet lumina apv the pontiac trans sport and the oldsmobile 
silhouette were selling well but needed the incentives anyway 
we could see that there is a need in todays market to have 
incentives on just about anything said pontiac spokesman ed 
lechtzin because people are coming in and like the vehicle but 
look at the price and say how much rebate money am i getting 
lechtzin said there was some concern that production at the sole 
plant producing the minivans may outpace demand but oldsmobile 
spokesman ross ruehle said the sales demand is a little stronger 
than anticipated for the silhouette 
i have heard that they are selling relatively well said 
senior economist tom webb of the national automobile dealers 
association in mclean va when asked why gm would offer a rebate 
on something selling well he said good question 
herb adcox owner of herb adcox chevrolet in chattanooga tenn 
said he suspected months ago that gm would offer incentives on the 
minivans when production at the north tarrytown ny assembly 
plant reached a certain level mainly because consumers expected 
them 
the company is increasing production at the plant which is 
expected to produce about 175000 vans this year and about 225000 
next year 
the new minivans went on sale last october since then gm has 
sold 30891 of the them with the chevrolet model making up more 
than half the new incentives became effective thursday and run 
until may 2 
chrysler corp whose minivan sales command more than half of 
the vehicles market segment offered rebates on the vans for the 
first time between last dec 15 and jan 31 
sales of the plymouth voyager dodge caravan and chrysler town 
and country soared during the incentive period since then the 
minivan sales pace has dropped 
what we think is we have been out there trying to sell 
something up against someone with an incredible rebate said 
chevrolet spokeswoman mary mcelyea 
ford motor co is offering a 500 rebate on its aerostar 
minivan that offer expires april 2

struggles to meet debt interest payments 
ingersoll newspapers is a holding company controlled by 
publisher ralph ingersoll its properties include the weekly st 
louis suburban journals the try ny record and several other 
mediumsized papers 
the offer is for as much as 80 percent of 125 million in 13 
percent reset notes issued by community newspapers inc also a

ingersoll newspapers also is offering to buy as much as 51

the 13 percent notes have been trading around 390 to 420 for 
1000 notes and the 1475 percent debentures for about 200 for

the company is under the pressure of a june 30 deadline to reset 
its interest rate to restore the value of the notes to face amount 
said junk bond analyst ned zachar of duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
reset notes must be adjusted periodically to keep their trading 
value in line with face value 
zachar said ingersoll like other newspaper companies in the 
northeastern united states is facing financial problems from the 
overall economic slowdown ingersoll spokesman mark harnett said 
earnings have fallen off

offer to avoid pushing the company into bankruptcy but he expected 
a higher purchase price to result from negotiations 
i think theres a pretty good chance ingersoll will suceed 
with a tender offer he said but whether it will be at this 
price or another remains to be seen the bondholders will likely 
push for a little more

three former northwest airlines pilots were 
charged by federal and state officials thursday with operating a 
boeing 727 commercial jetliner while under the influence of alcohol 
charges were filed separately by the us attorneys office in 
minneapolis and by north dakota officials against capt norman 
prouse 51 of conyers ga first officer robert kirchner 35 of 
highland ranch colo and second officer joseph balzer 34 of 
antioch tenn 
we consider the driving of a common carrier whether it be an 
aircraft a train or a bus while under the influence of alcohol to 
be a very serious offense us attorney jerry arnold told a news 
conference here 
according to an fbi agents affidavit prouse purchased 14 rum 
and diet cokes at a bar over a sixhour period the evening before 
the march 8 flight left fargo nd for minneapolis and another 
bar patron purchased five additional drinks for him the affidavit 
said the other two crew members were served seven pitchers of beer 
witnesses said prouse balzer and kirchner were visibly 
intoxicated at the bar the affidavit said between 7 to 8 hours 
expired from the time the pilots left the bar and their 630 am 
flight time 
tests conducted at the hennepin county medical center in 
minneapolis shortly after the pilots arrest showed prouse had a 
bloodalcohol level of 012 percent 
balzers bloodalcohol level was 007 percent and while 
kirchners was 006 percent according to the test results which 
were made available to the associated press 
federal regulations prohibit pilots from flying if they have 
higher than a 004 percent level the legal limit for driving a 
vehicle is 010 in most states 
arnold said the federal felony charges were brought under a 
statute passed by congress as part of the 1986 antidrug abuse act 
prohibiting operation of a common carrier while under the influence 
of alcohol or drugs 
the maximum penalty on the federal charges is 15 years in prison 
andor a 250000 fine he said 
arnold said arrangements were being made for the three pilots to 
turn themselves in voluntarily next week in minneapolis they are 
scheduled to be arraigned march 29 he said 
in north dakota the three were charged in cass county court 
with operating an aircraft while intoxicated and acting as an 
aircraft crew member within eight hours of drinking the charges 
each are misdemeanors punishable by a 1000 fine and one year in 
prison under north dakota law 
this kind of conduct by airline pilots should not be condoned 
and cannot be tolerated by todays traveling public county 
prosecutor robert hoy said its incumbent upon those individuals 
with positions of responsibility over this type of conduct to make 
sure it does not happen again 
prouse balzer and kirchner were detained in minneapolis upon 
landing flight 650 safely following a tip to federal authorities 
that the crew had been drinking the night before 
the airline has fired the three and the federal aviation 
administration has revoked their pilot licenses the three plan to 
appeal their license revocations their attorneys have said 
mark mcdermott a washington dc lawyer representing 
kirchner said the defense will do whatever we have to do to 
defend his rights 
bruce hanley the minneapolis attorney who represents balzer 
said his client will plead innocent he said it was too early to 
comment on the allegations in the governments affidavit 
prouse has an unlisted telephone number 
prosecutors from the city attorneys office in minneapolis have 
met with federal attorneys to discuss the case deputy city 
attorney mitchell rothman said wednesday his office would wait 
until federal authorities decided whether to prosecute the pilots 
before deciding whether to file city charges 
rothman had said the city isnt likely to prosecute if federal 
authorities do so 
bob gibbons northwest airlines director of media relations 
declined to comment thursday on the charges saying we wont 
have any viewpoint on any of the court action involving the former 
pilots

coast savings a thrift with 112 billion in 
assets said thursday it would provide free insurance on many items 
purchased with personal checks drawn on its accounts 
the move is the latest by man banks and thrifts to attract 
customers since last summer banks have extended monday through 
friday hours opened on weekends created branches in supermarkets 
and even paid bonuses to customers if service lags 
everybody is after market share said dan williams a bank 
analyst with sutro amp co in san francisco if deposit insurance 
works for coast it may get to the point where everyone will have 
to do it 
the plan is similar to those already provided by american 
express co and other credit card companies gold cards and a 
small but growing number of banks including californias napa 
valley bank and valley national bank of arizona 
purchases included in the program and paid for in full with 
coast checks are insured for 90 days against theft loss 
accidental breakage and fire manufacturers warranties are doubled 
up to a year so a 90day warranty is good for 180 days claims can 
be filed through a tollfree 24hour number 
coast with 112 billion in assets and 125 branches in the 
state is the first major california financial institution to 
provide such insurance 
its president gerrald d barrone said a quarter of coasts 
customers now have checking accounts about 200000 in all the 
thrift hopes to improve that figure by 50 percent this year taking 
in about 20 million a month in new checking accounts he said 
the program begins monday some items such as vehicles 
dwellings coins services art objects items used for business 
and consumables such as fuel and food are excluded from coverage 
barrone said coast pays an insurance company 86 cents per year 
per checking account for the purchase insurance service coast has 
a conventional range of checking accounts one popular one provides 
free checking with a minimum balance of 500 
financial services consultant bert ely said the united states is 
glutted with banks and thrifts coasts new program is taking 
place in the context of an extremely competitive industry ely 
said 
big banks were watching carefully 
its definitely something were looking at and were aware 
its gaining in popularity but we have no plans for a similar 
program at this time said kathleen shilkret a spokeswoman for 
san franciscos wells fargo bank

a house committee approved a compromise 
thursday on tougher smog controls in a clean air bill while a 
proposal for financial aid to coal miners still held up movement on 
similar legislation in the seante 
the 382 vote by the house energy and commerce committee created 
one areas of likely conflict when the senate and house versions of 
the two bills eventually have to be reconciled the senate earlier 
in the week rejected some of the same smog controls 
meanwhile senate leaders worked with the white house and sen 
robert byrd dwva in an attempt to find a way to resolve the 
dispute over the coal miner assistance 
a vote on the amendment brought to the floor by byrd nearly two 
weeks ago has been postponed at least twice senate leaders are 
fearful that byrd has the votes to get it passed that could 
unravel the compromise legislation worked out with the white house 
they fear because of the temptation it would pose for lawmakers to 
claim similar aid for other industries 
the coal aid amendment did not surface again thursday or 
thursday night and aides to senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said the issue would be held over to next week earlier in 
the day mitchell had said he expected it to be resolved one way 
or another by the end of the day thursday 
the house committee vote came after two days of negotitions 
among committee leaders including rep john dingell dmich the 
chairman many members voted only minutes after having first seen 
the inchthick document 
the house provisions would continue to allow the environmental 
protection agency to impose an air pollution control plan if local 
officials fail to act would bring many small businesses under 
smogcontrol regulations in cities with the dirtiest air and would 
eliminate certain waivers now possible on grounds that compliance 
would cost too much these were provisions the senate rejected 
earlier in the week 
the senate spent much time on marginal amendments 
the byrd proposal calls for a 500 million program to help 
miners who lose their jobs from tougher acid rain pollution 
controls the white house calls the plan too expensive and has 
lobbied hard against it 
but byrd one of the senates most influential and most powerful 
members as chairman of the appropriations committee returned to 
the senate floor thursday to plead his case 
the coal miners are being asked to pay a very high price 
they will lose their livelihood declared byrd calling the 
assistance program essential to help 5000 miners who are likely to 
lose their jobs 
mitchell eanwhile was working with sen bob dole rkan the 
minority leader to try to get the white house to produce a 
compromise aid package that might be agreeable to byrd 
mitchell and dole have said they are concerned that passage of 
the assistance program would cause the white house to drop support 
for the compromise clean air legislation that was agreed to in 
lengthy closeddoor negotiations between senate leaders and the 
bush administration 
if the deal falls apart there likely will be no clean air bill 
from the senate this year mitchell maintained earlier in the week 
on wednesday night byrd offered to lower the packages expected 
cost from 700 million over four years to 500 million over three 
years now he said he would retreat no further 
im not going to stand here and say ive got 51 votes needed 
for passage but i can tell you you dont have 51 votes either 
and i can tell you im very close byrd told mitchell as debate 
on the issue continued late into the night wednesday 
byrd complained that the white house had been unwilling to 
negotiate with him so ive negotiated with myself originally 
byrd had sought a much broader aid package which could have cost 
16 billion over six years 
byrd argued that coal miners should be singled out for help 
because the bill which calls for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions 
from electric utilities by 10 million tons a year by the end of the 
decade takes direct aim at these workers 
industry has argued forcefully among senators in recent weeks 
that the tougher proposed controls on toxic industrial chemical 
releases would cost thousands of jobs in the steel chemical and 
petroleum industries
