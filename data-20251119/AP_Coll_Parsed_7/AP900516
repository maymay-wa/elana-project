a vietnamera commander who advises the 
veterans affairs department on agent orange said wednesday veterans 
should be compensated for 27 cancers or other afflictions he says 
were linked to the herbicide 
retired adm elmo r zumwalt jrs assessment came at the 
opening of two days of hearings by a va advisory committee on 
health effects related to herbicide exposure 
the panels conclusions will help determine whether the va will 
award serviceconnected disability payments to vietnam veterans 
exposed to the dioxincontaminated herbicide 
the department has already decided to award compensation for one 
related cancer nonhodgkins lymphoma that decision was based on 
a congressionally mandated study of cancer among vietnam veterans 
the study however was inconclusive on agent orange exposure 
zumwalt was commander of naval forces in vietnam and ordered 
that the herbicide be sprayed his son elmo r zumwalt iii was a 
patrol boat commander at the time and died two years ago at age 42 
of cancer purportedly linked to exposure a grandson suffers from a 
birth defect also purportedly linked to exposure 
zumwalt has recently been an adviser to veterans secretary 
edward j derwinski and is a member of the vas advisory committee 
on environmental hazards 
he said his conclusions closely paralleled those of a group of 
independent scientists retained by the american legion vietnam 
veterans of america and the national veterans legal services 
project 
that group said earlier this month the vas advisory committee 
on environmental hazards ignored a large body of data the 
scientists said they found evidence to compensate veterans for 
eight ailments or diseases and evidence to consider compensating 
for 13 others 
i suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable 
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same 
conclusion zumwalt said 
zumwalt said compensation could be justified for 27 afflictions 
including softtissue sarcoma chloracne and other skin disorders 
liver disease hodgkins disease neurologic defects birth 
defects leukemia and 13 other cancers 
derwinski was still reviewing the private report from zumwalt 
and could not comment on it said spokeswoman donna st john 
the government and veterans advocates have been at odds for 
nearly a dozen years over the link between agent orange and various 
diseases the government centers for disease control has concluded 
that there is no way to determine which veterans have been exposed 
some 12 million gallons of the herbicide was sprayed between 
1965 and 1970 the herbicide was contaminated during manufacture 
with dioxin regarded by the environmental protection agency as a 
probable human carcinogen 
more than 36000 veterans have been denied claims as a result of 
the impasse derwinski in deciding not to appeal a court case a 
year ago paved the way for the issue to be reconsidered 
in another development dealing with agent orange the internal 
revenue service said it has declared nontaxable the payments to 
veterans from a fund established in 1984 by herbicide manufacturers 
as a result of a lawsuit some 60000 servicemen who served in 
vietnam from 1961 through 1972 or their survivors are eligible for 
payments

people dont fear the military as 
they did when gen manuel antonio noriega was in power but 
deciding on its role and personnel is a problem for the new 
government 
the new public forces include officers who were loyal to 
noriega many panamanians question whether highranking officials 
of the old regime have a place in the new order 
panamanians wont accept that officers of the old defense 
forces could be those who in a democracy control the police 
the newspaper panamaamerica said to think about putting into 
uniform and arming those who for many years oppressed punished and 
tortured is not an easy task 
the militarys makeup should be submitted to a referendum said 
alberto conte leader of the civic crusade a business and 
professional organizaion that led the opposition to noriega 
keeping noriegas old officers doesnt offer any guarantee 
that the new public forces will be efficient respectful and 
demilitarized he said 
eusebio marchosky in charge of an effort to recover state 
property stolen by noriega and his cronies said officers who had 
served the dictator were hindering his work and retaining them is 
against the national will 
ricardo arias calderon who is second vice president interior 
minister and justice minister has said panamas leaders chose to 
keep noriegas officers after the us invasion in december because 
to exclude them would be to judge them categorically and not as 
individuals 
officials of the civilian government have accused members of the 
new public forces of crimes 
special prosecutor rodrigo miranda charged capt leslie loaiza 
head of the judicial police academy with involvement in the 
kidnapkilling of marcos rodriguez justines 3yearold nephew of 
former col marcos justines who was noriegas second in command 
and now is in jail 
officials say the apparent reason for the abduction was to force 
justines jailed on charges of helping steal 47 million in a bank 
scandal to share the money why the child was killed is uncertain 
fortyseven other other noriega officers are jailed on charges 
ranging from misdemeanors to murder 
noriega took refuge in the vatican embassy but surrendered to 
us forces jan 3 and now awaits trial on drug charges in miami 
arias said many panamanians had suggested firing everyone and 
recruiting from zero on the second day of the invasion he said 
the leadership had to decide between that and issuing a call to 
service on new terms 
forming an entirely new military and police force would have 
meant asking us soldiers to remain three to five years while it 
was done arias said 
mario rognoni a legislator from noriegas democratic 
revolutionary party said the idea of demilitarizing the country 
is an error because a modern state must have the necessary elements 
of security 
he said panama is made vulnerable by its location and the fact 
that it will assume control of the panama canal at the end of the 
century 
for more than two decades the panama defense forces were 
responsible for all military and police functions which now are 
under civilian control 
this years military budget is 80 million about 70 million 
less than under noriega and only 35 percent of the total national 
budget 
several specialized battalions noriega controlled have been 
disbanded along with six schools or bases generally used for 
military instruction a civilian police academy is in the planning 
stages 
panamas air force is run by the national air service and 12 of 
its more costly planes are assigned to the treasury ministry the 
navy and marines no longer exist 
there will be nobody in uniform in charge of all services a 
role reserved for the civilian president arias said 
he said a commission concluded the ratio of security forces to 
citizens should be 4 to 1000 meaning 8000 officers but that 
panama needed 12000 because of its forests and special maritime 
needs the commission was made up of security officials from spain 
argentina and costa rica which disbanded its army more than 40 
years ago 
noriegas defense forces numbered about 15000

the simon wiesenthal center said tuesday it 
inadvertently invited frederic malek to be vicechairman of an 
event that will commemorate the holocaust 
malek president of northwest airlines resigned from george 
bushs presidential campaign in september 1988 after admitting he 
had drawn up a list of jewish officials in the us bureau of labor 
statistics in 1971 
malek has since told numerous jewish groups that he is not 
antisemitic he said he had acted under intense pressure from 
thenpresident nixon who thought a jewish cabal was trying to 
undercut his record on the economy 
the new york office of the simon wiesenthal center contacted 
every major american corporation soliciting participation by their 
chairmanpresident for its regional dinner on june 6 in manhattan 
said rhonda barad eastern regional director 
the dinner will honor journalists who covered the horrors of the 
holocaust the chairman is british publisher robert maxwell a 
holocaust survivor 
barad said that had center realized the same frederic malek 
involved in the 1971 controversy was president of northwest 
airlines the invitation to serve as a vice chairman would not 
have been extended 
malek accepted the offer however and his name appears on 
invitations to the 500aplate dinner it appeared he will remain 
on the guest list although barad did not immediately return calls 
to confirm that 
frederic malek has apologized publicly for his actions in the 
nixon administration and his apology was accepted publicly by 
abraham foxman of the antidefamation league among other jewish 
leaders the statement noted 
perhaps he wants to make amends which is why he responded to 
the letter barad told the new york post which first reported 
the story in tuesdays editions 
malek did not immediately return calls requesting comment but a 
northwest airlines spokesman bob gibbons said 
fred malek made his peace with jewish organizations a number

a computerized weather station atop 
the sphinx will begin transmitting data that scientists hope will 
help them stop the monuments alarming decay 
the sphinx has deteriorated more in the last 50 years than in 
all previous centuries of its existence combined sayed tawfik 
egypts chairman of antiquities said tuesday 
the 200000 solarpowered station was developed by the getty 
conservation institute of marina del rey calif for a project in 
china and was adapted for the sphinx 
people have worked for thousands of years to keep the 
4600yearold crouching lion with a pharaohs face from falling 
apart but nothing has worked for very long 
rocks still fall from the structure located at the base of the 
giza pyramids a large stone fell from the great beasts shoulder 
in february 1988 provoking an international outcry 
the massive stone face now is covered with scaffolding egyptian 
conservationists are removing and replacing blocks already restored 
on the right paw and sides trying to make the sphinx look like its 
old self 
the 200pound 6 foottall weather station installed tuesday 
sits piggyback on the sphinxs back held in place by sandbags 
scientists said the monitor will remain in place for at least a 
year transmitting data to a computer a mile away 
it will monitor rainfall wind direction and speed relative 
humidity pollutants temperature and the effects of water and salt 
on the limestone layers that make up the statue all are possible 
causes of the monuments problems said frank preusser acting 
codirector of the getty conservation team 
an adjacent instrument measures solar radiation 
preusser said data from the new project should help egyptian 
officials develop a plan to save the sphinx 
the sphinx s perhaps the most famed and by far the most 
thoroughly documented and scrutinized monument of the ancient 
world he said there has never been a coordinated effort to 
methodically quantify and examine factors affecting it 
we cant stop deterioration of any monument in the world but 
there is always a solution to slowing the decay 
tawfik called the sphinx the greatest symbol of our heritage

to say they like beer in this 
brewing city would be an understatement its like a religion 
any city that would mark the 45th anniversary of its world war 
ii liberation by filling a surplus battle tank with the famous 
local brew and drinking it in one evening takes its guzzling 
seriously 
so its no wonder pilsen is headquarters for the national party 
of the friends of beer membership 5100 
czechoslovakia is gearing up for its first free elections since 
1946 and the friends of beer hope to win at least a handful of 
seats to ensure all those beery latenight arguments arent for 
naught 
organizers say they are completely serious 
politics was always a favorite subject in czechoslovak pubs 
but it never led to any action said ludek sibr a 25yearold 
student teacher and a founder of the party 
now he said pub sitters who dream up answers to 
czechoslovakias many problems could contact their own 
representatives in parliament 
the party is concerned with general social and cultural 
problems private enterprise and competition said sibr and antonin 
jelinek the groups prague campaign manager 
but its chief goal is improving pubs to restore friendly 
relations between neighbors and not just to promote consumption of 
alcohol jelinek said 
many believe that during 41 years of communist rule the culture 
of beer drinking declined under state management the once warm 
and friendly pubs became ugly unclean filling stations for 
alcoholics 
the feel of an english pub is what the friends of beer aim for 
sibr said 
his party arose out of a student strike in pilsen that was part 
of last novembers peaceful revolution after the communists were 
toppled participants looked for a way to stay active 
a joking suggestion to form a beerdrinkers party led to 
unsolicited membership applications in the mail the students 
decided to establish a real political party 
the party registered held a national congress and collected 
enough signatures to get on the ballot 
the average member is a 35yearold male sibr said but the 
oldest is 79 and 15 percent of the members are women 
it is doubtful friends of beer will get the minimum 5 percent of 
the votes needed in the june 8 elections to qualify for seats in 
the federal parliament but it does have a chance of making the 5 
percent cutoff for the czech regional parliament jelinek said 
just like the other 22 parties that made the ballot friends of 
beer is entitled to four hours of free advertising on radio and tv 
the spots aim to entertain jelinek said one shows a cartoon on 
how to drink a glass of beer

ruben rocha thinks his ancestors were 
robbed and he wants the us government to pay 
rocha leads a group of descendants of early texas landowners who 
want the us government to compensate them for some 12 million 
acres in spanish and mexican land grants they claim were stolen 
after 1848 
a lawsuit filed in us claims court in washington dc last 
month seeks at least 13 billion primarily for texas land between 
the nueces river and the rio grande mexico at onetime recognized 
the nueces as its border with texas rather than the rio grande 
at the center of the dispute are 433 land grants given by the 
king of spain or the republic of mexico said rocha 
the brownsville resident is president of the alliance of 
descendants of texas land grants the lawsuit filed by rochas 
group alleges that families illegally lost the land when it became 
part of the united states after the signing of the 1848 treaty of 
guadalupehidalgo 
under the treaty following the mexican war mexico surrendered 
half its territory to the united states including areas of texas 
new mexico arizona and california 
rocha said many families including his were driven off their 
land in the following years he said he is a descendant of matias 
longoria who received land grants totaling about 36000 acres from 
the king of spain in 1767 
the united states did not protect the rights of those people 
who lived here rocha said some of them were cheated some of 
them were killed some of them were sent back to mexico any way 
they could get them there we feel that maybe its time for the 
united states to correct that 
us justice department spokeswoman amy casner said she could 
not comment on unresolved litigation 
oil and natural gas discoveries in south texas this century 
would have made the families wealthy said willard holgate an 
attorney for the alliance 
had these people not been deprived of their property i 
believe they would be very influential economically politically 
and socially he said 
in addition to at least 6144 million for the 686 alliance 
members the lawsuit seeks class action compensation of at least 
750 million for as many as 20000 others 
holgate said the 13 billion figure was based on the lands 
estimated value of 195 million in a 1923 treaty between the united 
states and mexico 
the lawyer said he also will try to persuade congress to pass 
legislation compensating the land grant descendants 
a lawsuit that land grant families filed against mexico was 
dismissed by a us court in 1983 for lack of jurisdiction

mikhail gorbachevs upcoming visit to 
the us heartland has rekindled an iowa familys memories of the 
day nikita khrushchev stopped by their farm and showed them 
russians werent evil nasty commies 
it was sept 23 1959 when the soviet premier made the corn 
fields of iowa a world stage for a show of warmth that marked the 
beginning of a thaw in superpower relations 
gorbachev has scheduled a visit to minnesota on june 3 after his 
washington summit with president bush 
arms reductions will be on the agenda for those talks but 
ussoviet tensions today are small compared with the period of 
khrushchevs visit to roswell and elizabeth garsts farm in those 
days americans were digging bomb shelters and schoolchildren 
practiced taking cover in the classroom 
liz garst was 8 when khrushchev visited her grandfathers 
2500acre farm she remembers discussions among the towns 1500 
residents about how long it would take for radioactivity to drift 
to coon rapids if a bomb fell on the strategic air command base at 
omaha neb 
but she found the soviet leader kind of jolly he smiled a 
lot he wasnt scary khrushchevs wife nina was a very 
motherly woman who was fluent in english ms garst said 
these people were not evil nasty commies they laughed and 
smiled they let you sit on their lap ms garst said im glad 
its happening again 
ms garst now chairwoman of a local bank vividly recalls the 
excitement of the visit 
a tomboy she fought unsuccessfully with her mother for trying 
to make her wear white anklets with a frilly pink party dress she 
remembers her brother and cousins asking soviet dignitaries for the 
medals they wore and getting maybe a dozen straight off their 
chests 
it was hardly a cozy gathering however with armed guards an 
unruly press corps of 300 and a soviet entourage of 80 
but it was a visit filled with symbolism 
at one point khrushchev patted the bulging belly of 240pound 
donald watkins and said thats what america is like then 
roared with laughter 
the visit was a signal that relations were warming said 
steven hoch a russian historian at the university of iowa it 
launched soviet efforts to improve farm productivity which is 
still a problem a dozen soviet experts are living with iowa farm 
families in a monthlong exchange to learn us agricultural 
techniques 
before the visit khrushchevs slogan to rally industrial growth 
in the soviet union was reach and surpass america and the 
soviet leader had declared we will bury you 
hoch said khrushchev and his advisers were truly shocked by 
the productivity of large american farms 
khrushchev returned to the soviet union obsessed with the idea 
of growing corn for animal feed and for popcorn and corn bread 
hoch said but his experiments failed food supply problems were 
key to khrushchevs fall in 1964 and these difficulties continue 
to plague the soviet leadership 
the garst family business which began selling seed for hybrid 
corn to the soviets in 1956 is now a subsidiary of the giant 
londonbased ici and still is doing business with the soviet union 
in march it announced the sale of more than 75 million pounds of 
seed corn to the soviet union the biggest such sale in more than 
10 years and enough to plant more than 500000 acres 
david garst 32 now vice president of garst seed co said his 
parents always believed that if you can help make a man prosper 
hes going to be happier and more friendly a wellfed nation is 
certainly less volatile

an engineering society thinks its time the 
world arms itself against asteroids that might collide with earth 
nuclear warheads suggests the american institute of aeronautics 
and astronautics may be needed to protect the planet against 
mountainsized space boulders that might smash into the earth at 
46000 miles an hour 
we have the technology needed to detect and track such an 
object and possibly to divert it from an impending impact the 
aiaa said we would be derelict if we did nothing 
in a position paper the society suggested that searches of the 
heavens be increased perhaps by spotting relatively inexpensive 
telescopes around the globe it also called for a study of ways to 
deflect or destroy or significantly alter the orbits of 
asteroids predicted to impact the earth 
vice president dan quayle referred to the position paper and a 
longstanding theory that asteroids could be captured and mined for 
minerals when he addressed the aiaas annual meeting earlier this 
month 
those same asteroids which promise material riches can be a 
threat as well he said in 1965 a small asteroid exploded 
high over canada with a force equivalent to an atomic bomb 
it would certainly benefit all nations to know when such a 
natural event might occur warn those who could be affected and 
maybe some day even affect whether or where such an event might 
happen quayle said 
asteroids are rocky bodies that orbit the sun between mars and 
jupiter the ones that have been observed range in size from 579 
miles in diameter down to about 700 feet 
some have struck earth in the past only last year an asteroid 
bigger than an aircraft carrier and traveling at 46000 mph passed 
within 400000 miles of the earth a distance less than twice as 
far as the moon 
such an object if it struck the earth today could cause a 
disaster of unprecedented proportions the aiaa paper said 
although the probability of such an occurrence is very small its 
consequences ie the casualty rate could be enormous 
johan benson the institutes administrator for public policy 
said it has been speculated that a nuclear weapon could be 
used to destroy or deflect an asteroid if it was discovered a 
year or so before impact 
use of a missile would depend on the composition and size of the 
asteroid benson said it could destroy it but if exploded 
properly it could simply propel it off into another orbit 
the aiaa suggested that an international agreement would be 
needed for nuclear interception and said this is a particularly 
good time to consider an international effort led jointly by the 
us and the soviet union 
another defense measure benson said would be to softland 
a propulsion system on the asteroid and slowly push it into an 
orbit that would miss earth 
last years asteroid was not discovered until it had passed dr 
bevan french a nasa scientist estimated if it had collided with 
earth the impact would have been equivalent to an explosion of 
20000 hydrogen bombs creating a crater five to 10 miles in 
diameter 
if it had hit the northeast corridor of the us or los angeles 
or tokyo said aiaa millions of people would have died instantly 
a sixmilediameter asteroid 65 million years ago is popularly 
believed to have caused a global catastrophe that destroyed the 
dinosaurs 
earthorbit crossing asteroids clearly present a danger to the 
earth and its inhabitants said the aiaa perhaps we have been 
lucky since 1908 there have been one direct hit one atmospheric 
entry and at least two near misses

tests commonly used to check for the aids 
virus may fail to detect many people who actually are infected a 
study suggested today 
scientists at emory university in atlanta tested the blood of 
165 people who had tested negative for the human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv which causes aids and found that 30 actually were 
infected with the virus 
dr tab ansari the emory professor who supervised the study 
said tuesday that his team used a new type of test to find hiv 
antibodies in blood samples that the routine laboratory tests had 
said were diseasefree 
all of the ones that they found positive we found positive in 
our assay said ansari but in addition there were quite a few 
that were negative in their assay that were picked up as positive 
in our assay 
ansari said the experiment began with 165 blood serum samples 
that were tested using elisa or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay 
the aids test most commonly used in hospitals and clinics the 
samples then were additionally tested using the western blot assay 
a test routinely used to confirm the elisa finding 
all of the samples tested in this traditional way were found 
negative for the hiv virus according to the study which was 
distributed by the national academy of sciences 
meanwhile unlabeled blood from the same samples along with 
blood specimens from healthy volunteers were provided to ansari 
and his team he said his team did not know which samples came from 
a highrisk population mostly drug users and which came from 
healthy volunteers 
the specimens all were subjected to a test called the pokeweed 
mitogen assay a procedure that forces specialized cells in the 
blood to expel antibodies into the blood serum the serum then was 
tested using the elisa and western blot assays 
thirty or 18 percent of the samples were found to contain 
antibodies to the hiv virus an indication of infection and each 
of these 30 samples were previously found by the elisa and western 
blot tests to be free of virus antibodies 
ansari said the routine tests now commonly used will give 
positive results only if hiv antibodies are detected in the blood 
serum he said the pokeweed mitogen assay shows that there may be 
infected people who do not develop antibodies to the aids virus 
for some reason there are blood cells that have the antibody 
but do not secrete it said ansari this means he said the 
elisa and western blot tests would not be able to detect the 
antibodies 
ansari said enough blood remained in 26 of the 30 test samples 
to conduct an even more sensitive assay the polymerase chain 
reaction the researcher said this final test confirmed the 
findings of the pokeweed mitogen assay in 21 of the 26 samples 
tested 
a national institutes of health researcher who asked not to be 
named said ansaris study is interesting and confirms the 
suggestions of other researchers that people can be latently 
infected and not test positive for the virus 
the researcher said the study shows that there are still gaps of 
understanding that must be filled to thoroughly understand how the 
hiv virus causes infection 
ansari said his study should not be interpreted to mean that 
blood for transfusion which is tested with the elisa assay is 
unsafe he said all of the blood that tested positive in his study 
came from people at very high risk for hiv who would be 
excluded from donating blood for transfusion 
the study is published in the proceedings of the national 
academy of sciences which officials at the academy said were to be 
distributed today

summits generate a vocabulary of their own 
with budget superpower nato and economic gatherings in the works 
its helpful to know the language used by the major players 
heres a glossary of phrases for this season of summits 
keep your snorkel above the water level this is president 
bushs counsel for riding out heated budget disputes like the 
current one over taxes tomorrow there will be another tidal 
wave is his followup 
no preconditions this is the way the white house makes it 
appear that the president is open to new taxes without actually 
proposing any 
the trap this is what democrats say they think bush is 
setting for them when he says no preconditions 
listen to what i say and see what we do thats the 
president explaining to journalists how to read his lips on the 
subject of taxes nowadays 
well keep some mystery in the marriage white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater uses this phrase to justify why 
unpopular proposals floated at the budget summit may not be 
announced publicly 
fitzwater uses the same expression for not divulging what 
agreements bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev may sign 
when they meet in washington in two weeks 
table this word varies from summit to summit in foreign 
policy jargon tabling a proposal means to formally offer it but 
in congressional lingo a tabled measure is a dead one 
in budget summitry table is used in another way 
negotiators like to talk about whats on the negotiating table 
supposedly everything or whats off the table supposedly 
nothing that suggests it must be an awfully sturdy table 
everything is on the table but no one wants to pick up the 
serving spoon says robert reischauer director of the 
congressional budget office 
but senate minority leader bob dole rkan said after the 
first budget meeting at the white house on tuesday theres 
nothing on the table 
the flat earth society members according to rep dan 
rostenkowski dill are those who say tax increases are 
unnecessary 
revenues its the word democrats and republicans alike use 
when they really mean more taxes franklin roosevelt called them 
revenues and if its good enough for franklin its good enough 
for me said sen alan simpson rwyo 
process reform thats what budget director richard darman 
says when hes really talking about giving the president lineitem 
veto powers and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget 
feet up thats how bush characterized in advance his first 
summit with gorbachev however last decembers shipboard meeting 
in malta turned out to be not quite so informal in fact bush 
presented a 17point package of proposals 
fitzwater said the upcoming bushgorbachev session rather than 
being a feetup gettogether will be one in which they can 
really roll up their sleeves 
the budget summit meanwhile is feet on the floor and hands 
on the table fitzwater says 
initial lack of progress on arms control agreements could 
leave bush and gorbachev with nothing to sign at their upcoming 
summit so when an agreement isnt quite ready to be signed it may 
still be eligible to be initialed 
then the details can be filled in later and even though bush 
says were going to have to hustle to have something to even 
initial the agenda for the summit includes a 6 pm june 1 
signing ceremony for sovietus documents 
what documents 
the united states isnt sure at this time says spokesman 
fitzwater theres a lot of things that could be signed he 
adds 
this goes for your horse too this is part of president 
bushs advice to gorbachev not to worry about demonstrators at 
home like the ones who booed the soviet leader at a may day parade 
bush did not elaborate perhaps wisely but he suggested that 
heckling was one of the fruits of democracy and that gorbachev 
should see some of the parades i go to around here 
in other words gorbachev might do well to keep his snorkel 
above the water level

mayor marion barrys attorney wants to avoid 
delaying the mayors upcoming drug and perjury trial but political 
aides say lengthy court proceedings wont stop barry from running 
for reelection 
after the mayor pleaded innocent on tuesday to six new drug 
charges in an amended indictment defense attorney r kenneth mundy 
said the extra counts could jeopardize the scheduled june 4 start 
of the trial 
we will not be deterred mundy said after the fiveminute 
hearing we want to show the public and the court that we will 
not drag our feet it will not be the defense that stalls 
july 5 is the deadline for barry to enter the democratic 
primary and a delay in the trial would mean that his legal dilemma 
would not be resolved by then barry has not officially announced 
his reelection plans but has been making a series of 
campaignstyle appearances around the city in recent weeks 
but a barry political aide speaking on condition of anonymity 
said a prolonged trial wont affect the mayors plans to seek a 
fourth fouryear term 
the bias from the campaign is that we just go ahead with 
the campaign said the aide the feeling is you just dont let 
the other side cut off your options 
the aide who stressed that meeting the july 5 deadline only 
allows the mayor to keep his options open said a reelection run 
appears likely anyhow were getting very encouraging signs from 
the community 
the new charges returned by a grand jury last thursday accuse 
barry of five misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and one 
misdemeanor count of conspiracy the mayor took drugs as far back 
as 1984 the new indictment alleges 
barry previously pleaded innocent to eight charges brought feb 
15 alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and that he 
possessed cocaine on five occasions the new indictment includes 
all 14 charges three of them felony perjury counts 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson said he hopes to 
start the trial on time but mundy complained during the hearing 
that the governments refusal to turn over a list of witnesses 
might hamper his preparation 
barrys lawyer complained that prosecutors on monday provided 
him only a set of photographs and telephone records 
outside the courtroom us attorney jay stephens refused to say 
whether the photos were from additional surveillance of barry or 
snapshots provided by grand jury witnesses stephens said last week 
the investigation of barry was continuing 
one of the drugpossession counts stems from barrys arrest jan 
18 in an fbi undercover sting operation that allegedly videotaped 
the mayor smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel 
the government is not required to disclose the names of 
witnesses who will testify against a defendant assistant us 
attorney richard roberts said in the courtroom 
roberts said hotel records had been produced for the defense as 
well as job applications he did not elaborate 
jackson said the defense is entitled to know who alleged 
coconspirators are he cautioned roberts that becoming immersed 
in disputes about turning over information to the defense would 
increase the likelihood of a postponement of the trial 
jackson said the defenses pretrial motions on the new charges 
will be due monday and the governments responses next thursday a 
hearing will be held may 25 
barry refused to talk about his legal situation with reporters 
after the court appearance

israels army citing enhanced arab chemical 
warfare capabilities has stepped up plans to distribute gas masks 
nationwide and has prepared television ads on how to use them 
when the army first gave out masks on a trial basis in 1979 the 
results showed the public did not take the threat seriously 
masks were used for painting cars or worn to masquerade parties 
needles in the medical kits were used for dart games 
in order to get public cooperation there has to be a 
perceived threat said an israeli major who briefed a reporter on 
the program under standing regulations he could not be named 
today israelis appear to accept the possibility of a poison gas 
attack as part of a new middle east reality 
army commanders say syria iraq egypt and possibly libya have 
chemical weapons and they say iraq is developing a biological 
potential as well as long range missiles to deliver such weapons 
the threat was brought home last month when iraqi president 
saddam hussein vowed to burn half of israel with poison gas if 
israel attacked iraq 
maj gen ehud barak the deputy chief of staff subsequently 
announced on government television an experimental distribution 
program will be expanded so virtually every home will have a gas 
mask 
the program is expected to begin on a gradual basis later this 
year in the meantime the army is producing a series of public 
service announcements on how to obtain and use the gas masks 
a videotape of one such commercial was obtained by the 
associated press a family is shown watching television when the 
husband hears his army callup code broadcast 
his wife kisses him goodbye at the door and then collects the 
childrens identity cards she heads to a storage depot to get the 
equipment and meets a neighbor along the way 
do you think there will be enough masks the neighbor asks 
yes theyll be enough for everyone answers the mother 
a narrator said anyone showing an identity card will receive a 
gas mask army officials concede this does not apply to the 17 
million palestinians living in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
palestinians in occupied lands where a 29monthold revolt 
against israeli rule is under way are excluded because the army 
says they will not be targeted by arab states and are unlikely to 
cooperate with israeli civil defense authorities 
the major said masks could be used by palestinian activists as 
protection against riot control tear gas used in confrontations 
between soldiers and palestinians 
the spokesman stressed that the 800000 arabs with israeli 
citizenship as well as foreign residents and tourists would have 
the same access to antigas equipment as the countrys 35 million 
jews 
israelis are already getting adjusted to life with gas masks 
drills have been held for the halfmillion pupils in the 
nations 2200 schools and gas masks have been distributed in 61 of 
the schools in the army officers say that almost every major 
exercise now involves antigas warfare 
the world still underestimates this danger and allows 
countries that develop and use such weapons to go unpunished 
said yitzhak samuel an insurance agent who lives in the tel aviv 
suburb of ramat hasharon 
samuel his wife etti and their three children inbal 14 roy 
11 and shimrit 6 received gas masks and medical kits 18 months 
ago as part of an experimental program in two cities to test 
whether israelis would take care of the equipment 
each family member received a cardboard box with a mask filter 
and syringe the needle contains an antidote and is injected into 
the leg in case of exposure to poison gas

the seniors at wellesley college may get not 
one but two first ladies at their commencement 
barbara bush said tuesday night she has invited raisa gorbachev 
to accompany her to the june 1 commencement at the massachusetts 
womens college where some students have questioned whether mrs 
bush a career homemaker is a good role model 
mrs bush said she has invited mrs gorbachev to accompany her 
and if she wants to id love to have her 
the first lady spoke with reporters tuesday night at the state 
dinner for tunisian president zine el abidine ben ali 
mrs bush laughed when asked if she had finalized her role in 
the may 31june 3 summit here between president bush and soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
all my life ive lived with the myth that i make the 
decisions i dont make all the decisions that go on im 
waiting to hear what everyones plans are she said 
mrs bush who delivered the commencement address monday at the 
university of pennsylvania in philadelphia said she was not 
worried about her wellesley speech and had no plans to import any 
special speechwriting help 
were all right on that she said i am going to give the 
same speech at wellesley that id give to the university of st 
louis or the university of pennsylvania or cumberland community 
college 
she admitted she was a little nervous at the university of 
pennsylvania but only because of 30000 people outdoors 
but it was wonderful she said i will confess that bill 
cosby walking in front of me didnt hurt me any cosby also 
received an honorary phd 
mrs bush proudly displayed one of the designer purses that was 
among the nearly 27000 in personal gifts she and the president 
received last year the tiny ornate bag designed by judith leiber 
of new york was in the shape of a wellstuffed puppy 
its gold and silver spangles snapped open to reveal a miniature 
comb mirror a tiny sack with what mrs bush called her mad 
money and a cheat sheet to remind her of guests names 
she said she may as well enjoy the purse one of four valued at 
3102 since i take the rap 
afterwards the bushes and their guests repaired to the east 
room where jazz pianist harry connick jr and his quartet

the owners of a stranded 
communications satellite are weighing an offer from nasa to launch 
a shuttle rescue mission for at least 130 million 
intelsats board of governors will determine the fate of the 
satellite orbiting uselessly 345 miles high at a meeting next 
month 
one of the paramount issues to be addressed is the question of 
cost said tony trujillo a spokesman for the washingtonbased 
notforprofit consortium of 119 countries it operates a global 
communications satellite system 
nasa payload manager william d green said tuesday the space 
agency will send up a shuttle in late 1991 or 1992 to rescue the 
intelsat vi satellite if intelsat covers the cost which could 
exceed 130 million 
it looks doable it basically comes down to a decision on how 
they feel about the costs versus the risks green said 
the uninsured 157 million satellite launched commercially 
march 14 ended up some 22000 miles lower than intended after 
failing to separate properly from a titan 3 rocket martin marietta 
corp which conducted the 272 million launch blamed an 
engineering design error in the rocket 
intelsat engineers afraid the satellite would enter the 
atmosphere and burn it managed to boost it into its present 
position where it can remain for several years trujillo said 
the 5ton satellite was to have eventually replaced two older 
intelsat satellites over the atlantic during its 13year lifetime 
it would have transmitted three tv channels and up to 120000 
telephone calls simultaneously 
the amount of money that could be made on the satellite as yet 
undetermined is something we have to factor into the 
equation trujillo said 
intelsat didnt insure the satellite because the premiums were 
too high and instead set aside money to cover a launch failure 
trujillo said he did not know whether that undisclosed amount would 
finance a shuttle mission 
nasa can retrieve the intelsat satellite and return it to earth 
for repair or have spacewalking astronauts attach a rocket that 
would boost it to its proper orbit 22300 miles high intelsat 
would prefer the latter option 
both options would involve the same degree of difficulty green 
said 
nasa has twice repaired satellites in space in 1984 and 1985 
and brought back two other spacecraft aboard shuttle discovery 
intelsat would pay only a portion of the cost if the shuttle 
carried other payloads for deployment 
plans for launching an intelsat satellite on the shuttle were 
scuttled by the 1986 challenger explosion after which president 
reagan and congress directed nasa to move away from the commercial 
launch business

mexico may be one of the fastestgrowing 
markets for us wheat in the coming decade says a new analysis by 
the agriculture department 
by the turn of the century mexico could be importing 22 
million metric tons of wheat annually triple the average of 
700000 tons during 198688 the departments economic research 
service said 
the us likely would capture most of the mexican wheat 
market assuming the import demand is for food wheat the report 
said mexico has been one of the largest us wheat markets in 
latin america although trade volume has been erratic 
analysts said the longrun import prospects are based on a 
computer model reflecting mexicos changes in economic policies 
forecasts of slower growth in domestic wheat production and an 
expected recovery in the countrys economy 
population growth and assumptions of world and domestic price 
changes also are factors in the mexican wheat outlook 
the report in the may issue of agricultural outlook magazine was 
written by economist myles j mielke of the usda agency 
per capita wheat demand in mexico declined during the 1980s 
largely in response to slow economic growth the report said 
since 1982 the economy has been weakened by large public debt 
payments reduced petroleum revenues rising inflation and interest 
rates falling real wages and high unemployment 
government policies in the 1970s and early 1980s also limited 
mexican wheat imports to protect domestic producers since the 
countrys financial crisis in 1982 a series of reforms has been 
undertaken 
import tariffs were dramatically reduced and other restricted 
trade practices eliminated in 198687 the report said however 
import license controls remained on wheat and some other 
agricultural commodities 
mexicos gradual liberalization of trade and price policy is 
expected to result in greater transmission of world commodity 
prices into the domestic market the report said the 
elimination of nontariff barriers should eventually lower domestic 
producer prices for wheat closer to world trading prices which are 
expected to continue their historic downward trend during the 
1990s 
according to the report mexicos per capita wheat consumption 
by the mid1990s is expected to regain its peak of a decade earlier 
and rise even further through 2000 
meanwhile mexicos growth in wheat production is expected to 
undergo a significant slowdown in the 1990s compared with the 
last 20 years 
with projected consumption growth outstripping production 
gains the results indicate a sharp rise in mexican import demand 
during 19902000 the report said 
but the author added that the computer study assumes no abnormal 
weather in projecting mexicos wheat import needs and that in 
reality weatherinduced variations in production likely will make 
annual import demand more unstable than projected

the agriculture department wants to hear from 
the public about designing new food safety regulations for certain 
refrigerated meat and poultry products 
products that would be covered by the regulations include 
readytoeat uncured perishable meat and poultry items that are 
packaged in a variety of sealed containers the labels indicate the 
food is perishable or carry instructions to keep 
refrigerated 
examples include soups sauces pastas salads and entrees found 
in refrigerated cases in delicatessens and grocery stores frozen 
foods or those that consist entirely of cured meat or poultry are 
not included 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said tuesday that consumer demand 
for fresh convenience foods has greatly increased the variety of 
these products on the market 
these products are perishable and if improperly processed or 
handled they may pose unique health risks to consumers he said 
we are asking for public comments information scientific data 
and recommendations to help determine what additional regulations 
are necessary to ensure the safety of these products 
crawford said the new refrigerated food products differ greatly 
from traditional meat and poultry although processed and packaged 
to destroy or retard the growth of harmful organisms they do not 
receive the thermal heat processing that is used to kill all 
bacteria in traditional canned goods 
the agency is also reviewing recommendations made by an advisory 
committee on microbiological criteria for foods on ways to ensure 
the safety of refrigerated meat and poultry he said 
comments can be sent by july 13 to policy office attention

total production of red meat and poultry is 
expected to rise about 2 percent this year due entirely to greater 
output of broilers and turkeys according to agriculture department 
economists 
red meat production is forecast to decline 1 percent from last 
year the departments economic research service said tuesday but 
broiler and turkey output is expected to gain 7 percent each 
beef production may increase slightly from 1989 the report 
said but commercial pork production will be down by about 2 
percent because of poor returns to farmers last year 
retail beef prices may rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last 
year and pork prices may go up 9 percent to 13 percent the report 
said 
total egg production is expected to be up 1 percent from last 
year following positive returns in 1989 and early 1990 the 
report said prices are declining as a result of the larger 
production

the conservative think tank created to 
do ideological battle with the russian revolution has extended a 
welcome to mikhail gorbachev 
the soviet leader has announced a twohour stop at stanford 
university on june 4 after his arms summit with president bush and 
visits to minnesota and san francisco 
your guess is as good as mine university president donald 
kennedy said when asked tuesday why gorbachev had scheduled the 
visit 
one attraction might be the hoover institute on war revolution 
and peace 
the think tank on campus has thousands of revolutionera 
documents including secret czarist police files among them is a 
police album with a mug shot of leon trotsky 
hoover director john raisian said scholars there would welcome 
any opportunity to exchange ideas about the monumental historical 
events ongoing in the world 
any visit to the hoover institution would be tinged with irony 
the institution was set up in 1919 by future president herbert 
hoover to demonstrate the evils of the doctrines of karl marx 
some of the czarist files were smuggled to the institute in the 
1920s said hoover associate director charles palm 
the french government had been asked by the soviets to see that 
the documents from the imperial russian embassy in paris were 
transferred to the new regime he said but an agent of the czar 
smuggled them out to us and then told the french the items had been 
destroyed in a fire 
the agent stipulated that the secret of how the items got to 
stanford be kept from the public until his death in 1957 palm said 
alexander kerensky premier of the provisional government 
overthrown by the bolsheviks in november 1917 came to work at the 
hoover institute in 1955 and stayed for 11 years he died in 1970 
as late as 1959 hoover wrote that the purpose of the facility 
must be by its research and publications to demonstrate the 
evils of the doctrines of karl marx whether communism socialism 
economic materialism or atheism thus to protect the american way 
of life from such ideologies their conspiracies and to reaffirm 
the validity of the american system 
the institution generated many of the conservative ideas and 
leaders of the reagan years reagan is an honorary fellow and 
several of his advisers including economist martin anderson 
former national security adviser richard allen and special envoy 
philip habib were among the more than 100 hoover scholars 
the institutes buildings including the landmark hoover tower 
house a library of about 16 million volumes and archives 
consisting of about 4000 collections 
hoover warned in 1961 that the leftwing faculty in stanford 
university is constantly conspiring to get control of the 
institution 
tension surfaced in the late 1980s when a drive was mounted by 
hoover scholars to put the ronald reagan presidential library at 
stanford after protests on political and environmental grounds 
the plan was scrubbed

offering his own plan 
cut defense spending in half raise taxes and cut middleclass 
entitlements he says and you can 
replace the deficit with a 70 billion budget surplus by 1995 
increase government spending by 15 billion a year for 
nonmilitary research and development to keep america competitive 
by 6 billion 150 per pupil to spur states to adopt educational 
reforms by 4 billion for highway and airport reconstruction to 
repair a deteriorating infrastructure also health insurance could 
be provided for the 30 million americans who lack it paying for it 
through a 6 percent value added tax essentially a national sales 
tax 
schultze who was chief economic adviser to president carter 
outlined his proposal in setting national priorities a 
brookings book whose appearance coincided with the start of white 
house budget negotiations on tuesday 
in the report henry aaron another economist from the liberal 
research organization disputed bushs assertion on inauguration 
day that america must limit what it tries to do because we have 
more will than wallet 
asserted aaron the question is not whether america has enough 
wallet but whether it has the will to use its abundant wealth to 
solve the problems that it faces the united states is a nation 
blessed with the highest per capita income its national product is 
2 times larger than that of the secondlargest economy 
the book concedes that the country faces no imminent crises 
that demand decisive leadership but says it instead confronts a 
more difficult challenge nagging problems whose solutions 
require immediate and tangible sacrifice but offer deferred and 
diffuse benefits 
schultzes plan for converting deficit to surplus in six years 
calls for cutting defense spending in half cutting social security 
benefits or taxing them like other retirement benefits cutting 
middle class subsidies and increasing taxes by 67 billion 
the amount that could be raised by an 85 percent surcharge on 
present personal and corporate income taxes 
those steps along with the savings from reduced interest 
payments on the national debt would generate a 70 billion surplus 
by 1995 he said 
that compares to the 119 billion deficit in 1995 the 
congressional budget office projects under present policies 
schultzes candidates for spending cuts include disability 
compensation to veterans with low disability ratings subsidies for 
merchant vessels and school lunches for middleclass children 
he also would jettison nasas manned space station a very 
expensive way to get modest scientific benefits cut mass 
transit capital grants and operating subsidies they go for the 
benefit of middleclass suburban commuters and eliminate small 
business administration loans except for minorities and disaster 
victims 
so far the nation has avoided disaster while running up 10 
straight big deficits each larger than 2 percent of the gross 
national product schultze concedes 
but he says that the nation can muddle through sustaining 
large budget deficits without a cyclical crisis does not mean that 
deficits do no harm and can be ignored a successful economy ought 
not only to avoid recession and inflation but also to provide for 
future growth 
aaron agrees that facing no military threat or economic crisis 
the united states can get by without absolute decline 
yet americans cannot escape the reality that decisions taken 
during this decade will determine whether the chronicle of growth 
at home and influence abroad continues or flags he said 
the budget impasse has led to a policy paralysis says another 
brookings researcher political scientist thomas e mann 
the most striking and unsettling feature of american 
politics says mann is the stark contrast between the 
extraordinary pace and scope of change occurring outside the 
country and the political immobilism within

a complex maze of federal and state laws 
governing employer health insurance plans practically invites con 
artists to prey on consumers say state regulators who want 
congress to change the system 
at a hearing tuesday by the senate governmental affairs 
investigations subcommittee the officials said con artists are 
using a regulatory black hole to set up fraudulent plans and 
leave thousands of americans with unpaid medical bills 
the panel is reviewing how the labor department and state 
officials investigate abuse and fraud within such plans known as 
multiple employer welfare arrangements or mewas 
the plans are normally used by small businesses with no other 
affordable means of coverage for their workers 
the federal law governing such health plans is murky because it 
gives conflicting responsibilities to state and federal 
authorities said jo ann howard of the texas state board of 
insurance 
it is far too easy for confidence men to hide behind the 
federal law and exploit its complexities she said fraudulent 
operators are taking advantage of a regulatory black hole to 
victimize the public she added 
tom gallagher florida state treasurer and insurance 
commissioner called on congress to return complete control of 
health care plans for small businesses to the states he noted the 
federal law governing such plans was primarily intended to regulate 
pensions 
for little firms more effective regulations means one master 
not two designate one level of government to regulate these health 
plans and you eliminate the con artists ability to rely on deceit 
ponzi schemes and false hopes of low cost gallagher said 
sen sam nunn dga subcommittee chairman said many of the 
plans were nothing more than sophisticated pyramid schemes in 
which the insurers ability to pay claims depends on attracting 
additional participants and premium dollars 
many of the plans are being looted by unscrupulous operators 
who use premium money to cover outrageous salaries commissions 
personal expenses and entertainment nunn said 
several victims of such schemes also testified robert wagner of 
whiteville nc thought he and 50 coworkers at a furniture store 
had health insurance coverage because they had been paying monthly 
premiums 
wagner said he found out the plan was fraudulent after he 
suffered a heart attack last year and was left with 12000 in 
medical bills roughly the amount of his annual takehome pay 
now he said he cant find coverage for himself and his two 
daughters 
david ball an assistant labor secretary who oversees the 
federal enforcement of pension and welfare benefits said no one 
had an accurate picture of the scope of the problem 
he noted that labor secretary elizabeth dole recently endorsed 
legislation to require the operators of such plans to register with 
the government and that she had asked congress for 130 additional 
enforcement officers to watch over pension and welfare programs

villagers waved danced and shouted 
support for rebels who drove reporters deep inside liberia to show 
their nearly 5monthold war against president samuel doe is still 
going strong 
western journalists were escorted on a 20hour drive sunday and 
monday through three of the countrys 13 counties including the 
countrys breadbasket and major mining center to disprove does 
claims his troops control the entire west african nation 
survivors of recent fighting said government troops massacred at 
least 32 people before fleeing advancing rebel troops and they 
showed reporters a pile of 15 bodies monday they said dozens of 
people were wounded by the government troops and it was likely 
other bodies were dumped in the bush 
when rebel leader charles taylor drove into tapeta with the 
13vehicle convoy carrying reporters scores of civilians waved 
palm fronds and welcomed him as a savior 
our leader mr taylor they chanted at the convoy which 
was protected by 200 armed rebels and an aging antiaircraft gun as 
it entered the town 120 miles north of the capital monrovia 
since taylors forces invaded dec 24 from the ivory coast more 
than 350000 people are estimated to have fled the fighting more 
than half of them going into neighboring ivory coast or guinea 
taylors promises to end corruption echoed those made by doe 10 
years ago when he took power in a bloody coup seizing control of 
the country from descendants of the former american slaves who had 
founded it in 1848 
taylor says he plans to install a transitional government and 
sees no role for opposition parties that have been harassed by doe 
until he decides to have elections he said that transitional 
period could last from 3 to 5 years 
he said the united states which has been the main source of 
foreign aid for liberia would continue to have a close 
relationship after he took power he added he would encourage 
investment particularly by western companies 
international human rights organizations accuse does troops of 
slaughtering hundreds of civilians particularly members of the gio 
or mano tribes taylors tribal base the us congress has passed 
a resolution condeming doe 
in the village of saithom survivor elizabeth kpue said does 
soldiers had rounded up people including children and shot them 
before fleeing the advancing rebels april 9 
they just shot her my little girl she was only 4 the 
27yearold woman said 
survivors were interviewed in a hospital on the liberian 
agricultural co rubber plantation owned by an american company 
taylors men appeared to be betterdisciplined than does and 
clearly controlled the areas shown reporters 
no vehicles were seen except those driven by rebels crude 
roadblocks of rope with a red triangularshaped flag that the 
rebels used were manned by villagers armed with shotguns 
reporters were met by a representative of taylor inside ivory 
coast on sunday and escorted to a dense forest path and across st 
johns river into liberia they were driven monday for almost five 
hours on the main road to within 30 miles of buchanan the main 
atlantic ocean port 
in tapeta the reporters were housed at a baptist mission whose 
american missionaries fled when rebels entered the town march 26 
taylor who said he was a prous diehard capitalist urged 
reporters to publish a warning to civilians of monrovia to evacuate 
the capital before his men invade he said he had held off 
attacking buchanan and monrovia to save civilian lives 
doe also has said he has held off attacking taylors strongholds 
because he wanted to avoid unnecessary bloodshed 
both men have refused to negotiate with each other 
taylor denied claims his forces had been trained and equipped by 
libya saying the soviet bloc assault rifles and other weapons they 
carried were captured from government troops who drop their arms 
and run whenever a shot is fired 
reports from witnesses of several battles support taylors 
claim some witnesses said the government troops quickly ran out of 
ammunition whenever combat began

a leatherclad brothel owner went to court 
brandishing handcuffs and a catoninetails whip to challenge a 
british claim for more than 98000 in back taxes for her services 
marion aken contended before three bewigged court of appeals 
judges on tuesday that since brothels were illegal she cannot be 
taxed 
andrew thornhill representing the government tax agency inland 
revenue argued that prostitution involved the provision of 
services and was therefore taxable 
no decision was made tuesday in the case which continues today 
her case came to the attention of the inland revenue in 1979 
when she incorporated her brothel business declared to be 
carrying on the business of prostitution 
this registration was later invalidated by the high court as 
being for an unlawful purpose said her attorney ian macdonald 
she therefore should not pay the 98750 in back taxes he argued 
thornhill argued robbers drug dealers and other people engaged 
in illegal activities are liable for taxes and ms aken should be 
too 
ms aken who told the court her age was anything between 28 
and 45 continues to work as a prostitute which is not illegal 
under british law provided a person does noy solicit on the street 
brothels however are illegal

after 12 years of debate leaders of 
irelands anglican church voted overwhelmingly in favor of 
ordaining women priests 
the clergy and laity gave their approval in separate votes in 
the churchs general synod session in dublin on tuesday the motion 
must be approved by the whole synod thursday 
the measure requires a twothirds majority but seems certain to 
succeed as that margin was secured in each of tuesdays votes 
the clergy voted 12959 and the laity 24261 on a recommendation 
made by last years synod the figures were announced by the 
churchs leader archbishop of armagh robert eames primate of all 
ireland 
the church of ireland has a total of 410000 members in the 
republic of ireland and britishruled northern ireland where most 
of the anglicans live 
the roman catholic church strongly rejects women priests and 
accounts for 70 percent of the 48 million citizens of both 
sections of ireland according to anglican statisticians 
about 1000 women have been ordained to the anglican priesthood 
mostly in the united states canada and new zealand 
the church of england mother church of the worlds 70 million 
anglicans still refuses to ordain women as do anglican churches in 
wales and scotland 
church of ireland officials said it probably will be many months 
before women become priests there are currently six women deacons 
and four others in training 
deacon ginnie kennerley said after the vote i just hope we 
can continue with it calmly peacefuly and prayerfully and without 
too much hurt on either side 
the rev john paterson dean of christ church dublin who 
opposes women priests commented some priests might feel they 
would want to leave the church of ireland altogether and perhaps go 
to the church of england others might feel they just have to 
withdraw to their parishes 
paterson said the consequence of ordaining women would be the 
adoption of a radical feminist attitude which would drive away 
members and weaken the influence of the anglican church as a bridge 
between different religious communities

actress jessica tandy one of several artists 
supporting government financial support for the arts says the 
movie for which she won an academy award this year owes a debt to 
the national endowment for the arts 
the 80yearold performer winner of the best actress award for 
her lead role in driving miss daisy told a congressional panel 
tuesday that the movie was based on a 1987 play that had received 
money from the endowment 
the endowment has come under close scrutiny since last year when 
conservative lawmakers pointed out that a few exhibits receiving 
nea funds contained art that many would consider objectionable 
sacrilegious or obscene 
the most outspoken criticism of efforts to put conditions on nea 
funding came from theater producer joseph papp who this year 
refused a 50000 grant because of restrictions placed on funding 
papp referred to the congressional critics of nea as jackals 
and hyenas ready to pounce upon an endowment that was weakened by 
constant underfunding during the reagan administration 
this years appropriation for the nea requires that art grants 
be reviewed for possibly objectionable content 
the subcommittee that heard from papp miss tandy and several 
other artists is conducting hearings on a request for 175 million 
in fiscal 1991 for the nea

several thousand flour mill employees who 
worked with grain pesticides 25 years or more were nine times more 
likely to get cancer than grain workers not exposed to the 
chemicals a new study says 
examination of health records of more than 22000 workers by the 
national cancer institute found they were at sharply increased risk 
of developing leukemia pancreatic cancer and nonhodgkins 
lymphoma 
we have a suspicion that it is a result of pesticide exposure 
but that isnt proven yet michael c r alavanja an nci 
researcher who supervised the study said tuesday 
results of the work were reported in the journal of the national 
cancer institute issue dated today 
alavanja said flour mill workers were twice as likely to have 
applied pesticides than were workers in other portions of the grain 
processing industry and that the excess numbers of cancer deaths 
appears most striking among flour mill employees 
alavanja said that in the last 40 years a variety of chemicals 
has been used at different times to control insects that infest the 
nations stored grains in the 1940s and 1950s the industry 
commonly used ddt and hydrogen cyanide carbon tetrachloride a 
known cause of cancer was used until it was banned in 1985 
phosphine gas is now the most commonly use fumigant 
the researcher said he had no evidence of any increased cancer 
risk for people eating bread or other products made from flour 
produced in mills where pesticides are used 
alavanja said that in a direct comparison with all other 
segments of the grain industry without regard to length of service 
flour mill workers were four times more likely to die of 
nonhodgkins lymphoma a cancer of the lymph system flour mill 
workers were twice as likely to die of pancreatic cancer and had a 
slightly increased chance of deeloping leukemia he said 
cancer risks increased with the length of the career in the 
milling industry 
when a comparison was made with other workers in the grain 
industry the relative risk rose to more than ninefold after 25 
years alavanja said in the study

it is unconstitutional for the justice 
department to require drug tests for attorneys applying for jobs in

the ruling tuesday by us district court judge gerhard gesell 
came in the case of carl willner who filed suit after the justice 
department tentatively accepted him for employment and then asked 
him to submit to a urine test 
gesell said testing willner would infringe on the right of any 
citizen not to be searched without a reasonable basis of suspicion 
the antitrust division requirement offends the fourth 
amendment gesell said 
the case is the first major federal decision on applicant drug 
testing involving government agencies said arthur spitzer an

as the goddess of democracy radio ship 
struggles to broadcast to china a small army of taiwanese is 
visiting that communist nation to distribute prizes to listeners of 
another prodemocracy station 
the recipients of the lottery prizes are among the many chinese 
from university professors to housewives who have been turning 
their dials to a taiwan radio station that began sending its 
broadcasts to china a year ago 
just days after chinas military crushed the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing last june the ruling nationalist party of 
taiwan began beaming its local news programming to the mainland as 
an alternative to the communist propaganda flooding the official 
air waves 
the strategy represented a dramatic departure from four decades 
militaryrun broadcasts to china had consisted mainly of vitriolic 
attacks on the communist bandits in beijing and instructions 
for air force pilots to defect across the taiwan straits in their 
mig jets 
its a soft sell of our way of life to china as opposed to the 
previous hard sell of ideological propaganda said john feng of 
the nationalistowned broadcasting corp of china 
the goddess of democracy is to begin broadcasting friday but the 
schedule may change because of difficulties it is encountering in 
taiwan where it stopped for supplies before it sails for 
international waters 
the taiwan government seeking to avoid hurting relations with 
beijing has voiced opposition to the project sponsored by a 
coalition of press organizations headed by the french magazine 
actuel 
while china has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the 
goddess of democracy the taiwan broadcasts have not been jammed 
they can be heard clearly in beijing more than 1000 miles to the 
north 
feng said the news broadcasts can be heard by up to 80 percent 
of chinas people but it wasnt until the station ran a lottery 
for its chinese listeners that the popularity of the programs 
became clear 
the station received more than 7000 letters from mainland china 
in less than two months after offering nearly 100 prizes 
including a motorcyle color tv microwave oven and refrigerator 
to listeners who could correctly identify the chinese zodiac sign 
for 1990 the year of the horse 
many of the letters came from chinese who described themselves 
as devoted fans of the allnews station some named favorite radio 
reporters while others offered opinions on the programming taipei 
traffic reports were big hits market reports were not 
the program we hate the most is stock market report wrote 
miss xiao from coastal jiangxi province we dont understand what 
a stock market is 
the drawing was held in january on chinese new years in taipei 
and the winners were notified by letter a student in beijing won 
the grand prize of a motorcycle 
since the station was wary of sending the prizes to china 
through the mail it held a second contest for its taiwan listeners 
in which the winners received a free trip to the chinese mainland 
to deliver the prizes they are traveling this month 
the station broadcast to china on three shortwave and one 
mediumwave channel provides coverage of local taiwan news 
although skimping on details of antigovernment protests as well 
as international developments such as the fall of communism in 
eastern europe 
i dont think our program is that provocative said feng in 
explanation of course we want the democratization of china 
but we really dont want to antagonize china 
still the broadcasts clearly are giving the chinese people 
information about the world that beijing would prefer they not hear 
a listener surnamed ren from the northern port of tianjin in 
china wrote to the station your broadcasts have given me a new 
understanding of the world and the meaning of the word democracy 
mr pan a faithful beijing listener said i feel that under 
the current news blockade on the chinese mainland your station 
provides us with a very good channel to understand whats happening 
outside 
organizers of the goddess of democracy radio ship also want to 
promote democracy in china through their broadcasts but say they 
will play a role different from that of the taiwan station 
the 1200ton ship is not the voice of any authorities or of 
any government said organizer christophe nick it is the voice 
of the free press from all over the world 
the ship was planning to leave for international waters 
thursday but it will find out later today if those plans must be 
changed because of delays in customs taiwan has refused to allow 
the ship to return to a taiwanese port after broadcasts to take on 
supplies 
the chinese nationalists who retreated to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to communist forces still claim china and 
remain technically at war with beijing although they have lately 
been trying to improve unofficial ties 
their stated goal is to one day return to the chinese mainland 
to again govern the country of 11 billion people

vincent van goghs melancholy portrait of the 
doctor who treated him in the weeks before his suicide sold at 
auction for 825 million making it by far the most expensive 
painting in the world 
the sale tuesday of portrait of dr gachet came after a 
10minute bidding war at christies auction house between two 
buyers who jacked up the price in increments of 1 million 
the 26by225inch oil was worth 141000 per square inch to 
kobayashi gallery of tokyo which has emerged in recent years as a 
major buyer of impressionist art 
the total surpassed the 539 million paid for van goghs 
irises in 1987 at sothebys said susan britman a christies 
spokeswoman 
explaining the astronomical price christies president 
christopher burge cited the paintings good condition its 
highprofile exhibitions in new york and the opinion among many 
that it is one of van goghs five best paintings 
we may have to wait another 10 years another 20 years for a 
picture of that importance burge said 
dealer hideto kobayashi told japans kyodo news service he 
bought the painting on behalf of an unidentified japanese company 
that wanted the work at any price they are extremely pleased 
kyodo quoted kobayashi as saying 
owned by the trust of germanborn banker siegfried kramarsky 
who died in 1961 portrait of dr gachet had hung since 1984 at 
the metropolitan museum of art christies had expected it to fetch 
between 40 million and 50 million 
the painting was completed in auverssuroise france six weeks 
before the artists suicide in 1890 dr paulferdinand gachet a 
practitioner of homeopathic medicine and a friend and physician to 
other impressionist painters had tended to van gogh in the final 
weeks of his life 
gachet is shown slouched at a table head resting on his hand 
in a letter to paul gauguin van gogh said he had painted gachet 
with the heartbroken expression of our time and that it was 
not destined to be understood 
a slightly larger version with less detail and flatter colors 
hangs in the musee dorsay in paris 
the auction had been anticipated as a test of the strength of 
the art market prices boomed in the mid to late 1980s but the 
1987 stock market crash and unusual circumstances surrounding the 
sale of irises had cast doubt on whether prices would continue 
to rise 
australian entrepreneur alan bond bought irises largely with 
money borrowed from sothebys bonds business empire became 
swamped in debt after the stock market crash and he was forced to 
sell the painting for an undisclosed price to the j paul getty 
museum of malibu calif in march 
on tuesday once the price on the van gogh reached about 36 
million two bidders dropped out the kobayashi representative and 
an anonymous private collector bidding by telephone began raising 
the price quickly burge said 
two people were determined to have a great picture burge 
said a tremendous battle ensued between the bidders all the way 
to the end 
the final price included a 75 million or 10 percent buyers 
fee that goes to christies 
the losing bidder bought another van gogh a selfportrait 
painted in arles france in 1888 for 264 million burge said 
the auction included other major works by impressionist and 
modern artists 
record prices were set for seven other artists including 1298 
million for henri de toulouselautrecs girl with fur and 99 
million for marc chagalls above the city 
the auction sold 57 of 81 works offered for a total of 2694 
million

a legislator today quoted president lee 
tenghui as saying he would be willing to talk to china on a 
governmenttogovernment basis to improve relations and work toward 
reunification 
defense minister hau peitsun likely to become the next prime 
minister today also supported such an initiative 
what we have in fact is one country two governments this is 
the reality he said 
the nationalist chinese government once ruled all of china but 
was forced to retreat to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to 
chinese communists it subsequently refused all official contact 
with beijing claiming the communists are a rebel government 
but both sides always have agreed that taiwan and china 
eventually should reunify 
we can accept governmenttogovernment talks under the 
framework of one china lawmaker ting shouchung quoted lee as 
saying in a meeting tuesday 
i can participate if we have equal status otherwise the 
chinese communists would consider taiwan to be a local 
government lee was quoted as saying 
such conditions may make such talks unlikely beijing has 
refused to recognize the nationalist government as an equal 
claiming that taiwan is a renegade province 
lees reported comments mark the first time the nationalist 
government has offered to hold official talks with its rivals 
ting said lee was responding to a proposal made by chinese vice 
premier wu xueqian who suggested to a group of visiting taiwan 
legislators last week that the nationalists and communists hold 
talks at the party level 
lee also said talks could not be held until beijing rules out 
the use of force against taiwan and stops trying to isolate the 
nationalists diplomatically 
it is unclear if lee is considering the formal recognition of 
the beijing government to make talks possible 
on tuesday the taiwan cabinet said it wants to set up a mission 
in beijing to handle the growing trade across the taiwan straits 
and allow china to have a similar office in taipei the proposal is 
viewed as a way to facilitate semiofficial contacts 
taiwan sanctions trade and investment in china if it is 
channeled through companies in third countries but many of the 
islands large entrepreneurs want to directly set up factories in 
china to utilize cheap labor and land

the stigma of love canal hasnt 
stopped people from signing up to buy homes at reduced prices at 
the former chemical dump 
about 200 people by tuesday had signed a list for homes that 
will go on the market in about six weeks according to the love 
canal area revitalization agency 
the environmental protection agency on monday pronounced 250 
homes in what has become a symbol of the nations toxic waste 
problems safe to live in they will be put up for sale over the 
next three years 
among those signing up were former love canal residents who want 
to return to the neighborhood they remember fondly 
the canal went right through my backyard as kids we used to 
go back in those fields mow them down play baseball said gail 
mcclinsey im fine and i have two children theyre fine i 
keep in touch with some of the friends i grew up with theyre 
fine 
james e carr the revitalization agencys planning director 
said drains have been installed to catch any leakage from chemicals 
dumped here by the hooker chemical co in the 1940s and 1950s 
they do testing all the time theres a continual monitoring 
going on he said sure id live here 
but lois gibbs a former love canal housewife who became an 
environmental activist said she and her allies would sue to block 
resettlement 
she said the study on which the epa ruled was flawed because 
scientists compared soil and air samples from the love canal 
neighborhood with samples from two other contaminated parts of the 
city 
carr said the asking price for the homes will be between 40000 
and 60000 about 20 percent less than the going price for similar 
homes elsewhere in niagara falls 
we are building in a certain stigma factor he said we 
think thats around 10 percent we are also building in a factor of 
the neighborhood being largely vacant 
the government declared love canal a disaster area in the late 
1970s after the dump began leaking pcbs dioxin and other toxic 
chemicals about 2500 people were evacuated and nearly 1100 
homes some built virtually on top of the dump were left vacant 
but carr said the stigma factor was minor 
a lot of people never believed the danger anyhow he said 
these are the people who are lined up on our list now

national enquirer photographer was on hand to record the event at 
her home 
but in october she was cited at an outdoor concert for popping 
bubbles so loud they disturbed the performers she said she did it 
so her kids could find her 
waiting outside a courtroom for dismissal of that case williams 
couldnt resist popping another one that drew the attention of two 
bailiffs who contended the explosions sounded like 38caliber 
gunfire

alleged nazi collaborators are hiding out in new zealand 
the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles provided his 
government with a list of suspects it included a former police 
chief in lithuania accused of killing several hundred jews in 1941 
and a lithuanian vigilante said to be responsible for the deaths of 
140 jews on july 29 1941 
palmer did not disclose the names of the suspects but said an 
inquiry would proceed 
we are going to conduct this whole thing with vigor palmer 
said it is a very important matter 
ephraim zuroff israel director of the simon wiesenthal center

zuroff said all the individuals listed were involved in the 
commission of murder he also refused to give the names 
the centers associate director rabbi abraham cooper said he 
did not know whether the suspects in new zealand were still alive 
so far crosschecking of immigration data and war crimes

commonwealth countries in recent years he said 
its a slow progress and there could very well be more names 
in new zealand he said 
new zealands external relations minister mike moore said he 
will set up a inquiry by monday 
he said a priority was to stop a person guilty of war crimes 
from slipping out the country while the investigation was under way

people slipped away ive asked for advice on that there is some 
urgency he said 
of the refugees who came to new zealand just after world war ii 
the vast majority were nazi victims 
if a few criminals smuggled themselves in thats a tragedy 
and that will be exposed he said

president roh taewoo will push ahead 
with his scheduled visit to japan his office said today despite 
an escalating diplomatic row over japans apology for its colonial 
rule of korea 
south korea however may develop some retaliatory measures if 
japan rejects its demand for a clearcut apology for wrongs 
committed under japans 191045 rule presidential spokesman lee 
soojung said he did not elaborate 
roh has been under public pressure to call off his trip next 
week to tokyo following controversial remarks by japanese 
governing party leaders asking japanese emperor akihito not to make 
an open strong apology but lee said the president would not 
reconsider the threeday visit beginning may 24 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu said tuesday he plans to 
apologize to roh about the colonial rule but would not say whether 
the emperor should 
elderly koreans have staged daily protests outside the japanese 
embassy to demand an apology and compensation for japans wartime 
acts the protesters many related to koreans who were killed 
during world war ii have asked roh to cancel his visit during the 
war japan drafted hundreds of thousands of koreans as soldiers and 
forced laborers 
japan the war criminal must apologize compensate a dozen 
protesters shouted today during a sitin outside the embassy which 
was guarded by riot troopers wearing helmets and carrying shields 
police did not intervene 
the matter is delicate for the japanese touching on the nature 
of the emperors role under the postwar constitution and recalling 
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late emperor 
hirohito had for japans wartime actions 
akihito succeeded to the throne after hirohito died in january 
1989 
rohs trip had been delayed twice by issues involving the legal 
status of some 700000 ethnic koreans living in japan japan agreed 
early this month to provide greater legal protection for koreans

officials said today that iraq has started 
civil defense drills in its major cities to prepare citizens in 
case of a nuclear or chemical attack by israel 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
drills were useful for both the authorities and the population to 
learn how to deal with such cases but he would not discuss 
details of the preparations 
residents in various cities said part of the drill included 
moving to huge concrete shelters where they stay for hours until a 
siren blows signaling they are clear to leave 
they were also given gas masks to wear 
others said they were moved outside towns in fast buses in an 
exercise aimed at moving them from a site that would be hit by 
nuclear or chemical weapons 
president saddam hussein said in april that if iraq was the 
target of a nuclear attack by israel he would unleash his countrys 
chemical weapons arsenal 
israel is distributing gas masks to its citizens in the wake of 
the threat 
israel staged an air raid against an iraqi nuclear facility in 
june 1981 accusing iraq of developing nuclear weapons iraq said 
its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and has voiced concern 
that israel will again attack to try to thwart iraqs developing 
weapons program 
israel has neither confirmed nor denied having nuclear weapons 
but has said it would not be the first to introduce such weapons in 
the middle east 
during the 198088 war with iran iraq built huge concrete 
shelters designed to withstand nuclear and chemical attacks iran 
and iraq slammed each others capitals with scores of longrange 
surfacetosurface missiles which killed hundreds of the civilian 
population

the badtempered highkicking african 
ostrich can run at 60 mph but thats not fast enough to escape a 
group of breeders who see the worlds largest bird as a nonstop 
profit machine 
the breeders say there is increasing demand for their feathers 
skin and highprotein lowcholesterol meat 
along with ostrich meats newfound popularity among stressed 
executives and health nuts in western industrialized nations the 
japanese have taken to preparing it sushistyle and eating it raw 
says breeder kevin grant 
unlike its domestic relative the chicken the ostrich yields 
red meat with a distinctive flavor about 55 pounds of top quality 
meat worth about 500 can be stripped from the averagesize bird 
but the 6footer offers other values says grant head of a 
recently established organization representing about 40 zimbabwe 
breeders 
finely tooled ostrich skin cowboy boots fetch as much as 5000 
a pair in texas the leather industry in that state alone demands 
94000 15footsquare skins a year 
not much else of the ostrich goes to waste either the 
feathers a symbol of justice in ancient egypt and of wealth to 
european royalty in the early 1900s made a comeback in the french 
haute couture of top fashion designer christian lacroix earlier 
this year 
japan wants the feathers to dust its cars and already japanese 
dealers have been sent to inspect zimbabwes fledgling ostrich 
industry 
according to grant an adult ostrich provides about three pounds 
of feathers and in all meat skin and other byproducts account 
for about 98 percent of its body weight 
scientists are even studying whether ostrich corneas are 
compatible with the human eye 
the flightless bird is not susceptible to tickborne diseases or 
traditional livestock ailments covered by international quarantine 
and transportation laws on animal products 
it makes good practical sense grant says 
neighboring south africa is the worlds biggest supplier of 
ostrich products some ranchers in texas and other parts of the 
american southwest also are dabbling with the birds 
grant says the fertile ostrichs giant egg is far too valuable 
to scramble for breakfast and contrary to popular belief the 
ostrich does not bury its head in the sand 
as well as that formidable kick the birds rapierlike toe can 
cut a person from chest to groin in a single swipe 
the risk of being kicked is part of the business says 
grant i have a gamblers heart and this could be a big money 
spinner

twenty years ago police opened fire on a 
college dormitory and killed two students linking jackson state 
with kent state in the national consciousness of a wars bloodshed 
brought home 
but while the may 4 1970 killings of four students at the kent 
ohio university were marked this year by the inauguration of a 
monument in a ceremony attended by thousands the 20th anniversary 
of the jackson state shootings passed virtually unobserved 
classes here ended may 12 and the few staff and students on the 
quiet sunny university campus tuesday went about their business 
evidently oblivious to the anniversary of the deaths of james earl 
green and phillip gibbs 
a small ceremony took place may 2 attended by about 300 people 
school officials said turnout was light because classes werent 
dismissed that day but some students admitted they knew little 
about the barrage of gunfire aimed at a crowd outside a womens 
dormitory 
there wasnt much talk about the shootings said tracie 
archie a 20yearold political science student who stopped by to 
view a black stone memorial to the slain students on tuesday my 
mother told me about it 
at 1205 am on may 15 1970 policemen opened fire on students 
at jackson state then a college during a protest of the vietnam 
war and civil rights issues the fbi later found more than 275 
bullet holes in the fivestory alexander residence center 
killed were gibbs a 21yearold prelaw major and 17yearold 
green a jackson high school student walking through the campus on 
his way home from work a dozen other students were injured 
its a part of history that really i think was kept quiet 
said cass parker an assistant chemistry professor and former 
student but there are students who will never forget what 
happened there are some students that will never let it be 
forgotten 
students lost a lawsuit over the shootings in 1974 no one was

the dollar rose slightly in european trading today 
but was expected to fall later in the day after the release of us 
consumer price figures gold fell slightly 
the us consumer price index to be released later today was 
expected to show consumer prices up 03 percent in april after 
rising 05 percent in march this would indicate falling 
inflationary pressures and increase the chances of lower us

the index is seen in some quarters as one of the most 
influential us indicators but dealers were not certain whether 
this months figures would trigger a dollar move instead traders 
may wait for the release of the latest us trade figures on 
thursday 
a lot of recent figures have been disregarded by the market 
said paul darmody senior dealer at nikko bank ltd in london he 
said the market seems to be pegging currency movement on a 
particular event with hindsight rather than reacting at the time

the consumer data could provide just the excuse investors are 
seeking to sell the dollar 
gold rallied in new york early tuesday but then fell later in 
the day the decline continued in far east trading early today 
one dealer said the decline was a combination of normal 
corrective reaction to the rally and a bout of japanese selling he 
said that although new york had driven the price higher on 
expectations of japanese buying japan had sold the precious metal 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 065 yen to a closing 15195 yen later in london 
it was quoted at a lower rate of 15180 yen

when his wife opened the library for her son andy on sunday asked 
if he thought it was unfair for his son to enjoy the privilege he 
said i dont know i wasnt there 
janet ashcroft and andy a seventhgrader spent more than two 
hours in the library used primarily by the executive and 
legislative branches of government it is normally open only monday 
through friday mrs ashcroft declined an interview request from 
the associated press on tuesday

some information out of a book i dont know so far i think 
thats uh weve been trying to get him to do that for about 7 or 
8 years now and i think every time i can encourage my son to do a 
little research im going to do it

the tiny gallery that bought the worlds most 
expensive painting for an anonymous client in a new york auction 
has added another trophy to japans growing collection of 
masterpieces 
the kobayashi gallery of tokyo bought portrait of dr 
gachet one of vincent van goghs last paintings for 825 
million after a 10minute auction battle tuesday with a telephone 
bidder at christies auction house the price includes a 10 percent 
buyers premium 
a staff member of hideto kobayashis oneroom gallery in tokyos 
fashionable ginza district said the world record purchase far 
surpassing the 539 million paid for van goghs irises at a 
sothebys auction in november 1987 came as a surprise 
we werent prepared for the deluge of reporters and 
photographers this morning said kasunori tanabe the price is 
amazing its as if we bought a dream 
tanabe said the new owner of portrait of dr gachet is a 
company listed on the first section of the tokyo stock exchange 
but declined to say more 
in new york kobayashi told japans kyodo news service that his 
client was extremely pleased 
kobayashi established an independent gallery in the ginza home 
to hundreds of similar art dealers 12 years ago after working for 
the nearby fujii gallery tanabe said 
both galleries are active collectors of impressionist works 
with tuesdays purchase kobayashi joined a growing list of 
recordsetting japanese art buyers 
the worlds third most expensive painting les noces de 
pierrette pierrettes wedding by pablo picasso was sold for 
489 million in november to nippon autopolis co the firm said it 
planned to make the painting the centerpiece of an auto racing 
theme resort 
another record smasher sunflowers by van gogh sits in the 
corporate headquarters of yasuda marine and fire insurance co in 
tokyo the 399 million purchase in march 1987 was a world record 
at the time and marked a highprofile return of japanese buyers to 
the world art market 
several others among the worlds 10 most expensive paintings 
have gone to japanese buyers 
shigeki kameyama owner of the mountain tortoise gallery in 
tokyo owns at least two prize masterpieces the mirror by 
picasso bought at sothebys for 264 million in november and 
interchange by willem de kooning also bought from sothebys 
in november for 206 million 
an anonymous buyer bidding through a tokyo department store 
paid 3846 million for picassos acrobat and young harlequin 
in a christies auction in 1988 
japanese dealers and collectors have bought 40 to 50 percent of 
impressionist works at christies and sothebys auctions in the past 
few years 
lackluster bidding in the most recent auctions indicates that 
the meteoric price increases of the mid to late1980s have 
plateaued sothebys auctioneer julian thompson said in tokyo last 
month 
but active japanese participation at recent auctions indicates 
that demand in japan for the worlds greatest masterpieces remains 
strong he said

australia will not permit the united 
states to base nuclear weapons in its territory if the pentagon 
decides to withdraw its military forces from the philippines prime 
minister bob hawke said today 
the lease for the six extensive us installations in the 
philippines expires in september 1991 without another agreement 
the issue was raised by a report of a study by the rand corp 
an american think tank which said australia was a possible option 
if the united states had to leave the philippines 
hawke said there had been no formal approach on the matter by 
the united states and he did not expect one would he said basing 
nuclear weapons in australia would go against provisions of the 
south pacific nuclear free zone treaty which it signed 
us navy vessels including some believed to have nuclear 
weapons have stopped in australian ports but us authorities 
have refused to say whether nuclear arms were aboard australia has 
not pressed the issue 
in dismissing the possibility of a us transfer of bases hawke 
said the rand report was more than a year old and had been public 
since december he said the corporation was a private body that 
could not speak for the us government 
it had identified australia as one possibility rather than as a 
preferred option 
hawke said the negotiations with the philippines were still at 
an early stage and there was no reason to think a post1991 
agreement would not be reached

pan american world airways called on the united 
states and foreign governments today to establish uniform 
antiterrorist security measures for all air carriers 
in a fullpage advertisement carried in the new york times and 
the washington post pan am said security measures ordered by the 
federal aviation administration were required for american 
airlines but not for foreign carriers 
to be effective security systems must come about through a 
cooperative team effort among governments their agencies and 
airlines it said to do otherwise would be to perpetuate the 
present patchwork of rules and regulations 
the advertisement signed by pan am chairman thomas g plaskett 
came one day after the presidents commission on aviation and 
security and terrorism released a critical report on airline 
security 
the commission was convened to investigate the december 1988 
bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland which killed 
259 people on the plane and 11 people on the ground 
pan am suggested that security systems could be supported by 
government funds or a surcharge on all international air fares 
governments of all nations must take direct responsibility 
by providing whatever resources are necessary for improving the 
security of international air travel the airline said 
the presidential commissions report called on the government to 
consider preemptive or retaliatory military strikes against 
terrorist enclaves in other countries to combat air terrorism 
a system should be set up to notify passengers of credible 
terrorist threats it said and the government should take more 
seriously the possibility of terrorist strikes in the united states

rival christian forces bombarded 
residential districts of their enclave for an eighth straight day 
today killing four people and wounding 23 
that raised the overall casualty toll to 1026 dead and 2753 
injured since the battle between rebel gen michel aouns troops 
and lebanese forces militiamen led by samir geagea for dominance of 
the christian enclave broke out jan 30 
aoun today was quoted by the conservative addiyar newspaper as 
denying an earlier report that he offered to step aside if the 
maronite catholic synod of archbishops under patriarch nasrallah 
sfeir asked him to 
i am staying at baabda to welcome geageas fighters here 
aoun told addiyar in an interview referring to the presidential 
palace 
at sunrise aouns troops and lebanese forces militiamen battled 
with rocketpropelled grenades and automatic weapons in the 
alleyways of east beiruts badaro sin elfil and ein rummaneh 
disricts according to police 
overnight explosions shook christian east beirut as well as the 
pinecovered mountains northeast of the capital 
the two sides have fought each other to a standstill there has 
been no clearcut victor but the lebanese forces control 
twothirds of the 310squaremile enclave 
we dont want aoun nor geagea i wish you go to hell youre 
killing our children youre starving us and youre kidnapping our 
men said a weeping woman on geageas lebanese broadcasting corp 
television during tuesday nights newscast 
weve always coexisted you just leave us and youll see how 
we can live together peacefully she said 
aoun geagea and syrianbacked president elias hrawi are 
maronites the community that dominated power since lebanon gained 
independence from france in 1943 
aoun holds the presidential palace refusing to hand it over to 
hrawi because he contends hrawis election by parliament on nov 24 
was unconstitutional 
aoun also rejected a peace plan worked out by parliament at a 
special session in taif saudi arabia last fall to end lebanons 
civil war because it did not specify a timetable for syrian 
withdrawel 
hrawi was elected to enforce the taif plan which gives moslems 
an equal share of parliamentary power with the christians and 
envisions the government ruling over a united beirut

an aborigine group today branded as 
racist and ridiculous an official report saying their people 
receive better care in prison than at home and do not see 
incarceration as a deterrent 
the queensland corrective services commission said in a report 
tuesday night to the state parliament that prison provided better 
housing education medical and recreational facilities than most 
aborigine prisoners experience outside 
tragically they do not see it as a deterrent state justice 
minister glenn milliner said 
the report said aborigines and another group of australia 
natives the torres strait islanders comprise 20 percent of prison 
inmates in queensland state but only 26 percent of the population 
the queensland aboriginal legal service called the findings 
racist and ridiculous the legal services vicechairman steve 
mam said the vast majority of aborigines and islanders would be 
horrified if charged with a criminal offense let alone sent to 
prison 
most prisoners come out of jail having learned only about 
violence and brutality he said in a statement 
aborigines have been living in australia for at least 40000 
years and today number about 160000 or less than 1 percent of the 
total population 
keith hamburger director general of the corrective services 
commission said australian society has to confront the social 
crisis facing aborigines and islanders 
there is no doubt that if the community as a whole would face 
up to its responsibility to solve the awful social crisis facing 
this muchmaligned and disadvantaged yet potentially talented 
ethnic minority there would be immense social benefits to our 
society as a whole he said 
the department of aboriginal affairs said aborigines have a life 
expectancy 20 years less than other australians and an unemployment 
rate six times the national average 
the government has said that 100 aborigines have died in police 
custody since 1980

organizers of the goddess of democracy 
ship today called on a senior taiwanese official to try to remove 
roadblocks to their planned radio broadcasts to china a spokesman 
for the vessel said 
the 1200ton ship which arrived in nearby keelung harbor 
sunday to take on provisions is awaiting approval by customs 
officials to take on radio equipment needed to beam the broadcasts 
from international waters 
a broker who was to help the ship handle the customs procedures 
pulled out tuesday and the ship has yet to find another agent 
organizers said they do not know when the ship will be able to set 
sail with all the necessary equipment on board 
organizers originally planned to leave keelung on thursday and 
begin broadcasts the following day 
ship spokesman pascal dupont said he other organizers and 
chinese dissident yan jiaqi outlined the project and the 
difficulties it was encountering to government spokesman shaw 
yuming during the 45minute meeting 
we also asked mr shaw different things we want to know 
dupont said refusing to elaborate 
dupont said shaw promised to make an official response soon the 
government spokesman was not available for comment 
local newspapers have quoted unidentified government authorities 
as saying the ship already has reminded the world of the crackdown 
on the prodemocracy movement in beijing in june and should abandon 
plans to broadcast to china 
although taiwans governing nationalist party is a sworn enemy 
of the beijing government tensions between the two sides have 
eased in recent years as business and civilian contacts have 
expanded 
china has accused taiwan of secretly helping the goddess of 
democracy and has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the 
broadcasts the nationalists have denied involvement in the project 
and have said the vessel cannot return to take on more provisions 
after the broadcasts begin 
the goddess of democracy is named after the statue erected by 
demonstrators in tiananmen square in beijing in may it was 
destroyed during the june 4 military crackdown that left hundreds 
perhaps thousands of civilians dead 
the ship is sponsored by a coalition of french news 
organizations and has a french crew although the vessel plans to 
broadcast taped messages from chinese dissidents who escaped the 
crackdown none of them is expected to be on board

voters in liberal eugene have rejected the 
chance to strengthen the citys nuclearfree zone ordinance 
with 24 percent of the precincts reporting from tuesdays 
primary elections 13789 voters or 70 percent opposed the 
measure while 5304 or 27 percent supported it 
the margin of defeat surprised both supporters and opponents of 
the initiative that would have toughened an ordinance that bans the 
local manufacture of nuclear weapons and their components 
the initiative also would have required nuclearfree zone signs 
at entrances to the city and an annual nuclearfree commemoration 
event the city would send notices about the ordinance each year to 
the oregon governor the states congressional delegation and all 
nations that possess nuclear weapons 
the opposition spent close to 70000 and we spent 6000 
said steve johnson chief petitioner for the initiative thats 
the most money ever spent in eugene on a ballot measure 
johnson said opponents got a boost when a company cited the 
measure in taking 250 jobs elsewhere and other businesses 
threatened to relocate if the measure passed 
we believe in peace because we do have a nuclear free zone 
eugene mayor jeff miller people are saying that we have other 
important things to deal with 
in 1988 voters approved an advisory measure asking whether the 
nuclear free zone should be retained 
rohr industries inc which manufactures parts for the aerospace 
industry said it had selected eugene for a 15 million plant 
after company officials learned of the pending initiative rohr 
decided to build the plant in san marcos texas

a federal appeals court has opened the way 
for construction of a 200 million observatory on an arizona 
mountaintop where a colony of endangered squirrels lives 
environmentalists attacked the order tuesday by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals and said they would argue against the 
mount graham telescope at congressional hearings june 26 
what the 9th circuit did was confirm that the endangered 
species act is dead and specifically anybody with enough money can 
kill it at will said robin silver spokesman for the maricopa 
audubon society 
the university of arizona which claims its observatory in 
southeastern arizona will not harm the 180 mount graham red 
squirrels said it hopes construction will begin in four to six 
weeks 
were very pleased that the appellate court thought the 
project should proceed university of arizona spokesman steve 
emerine said 
the twomember appeals court lifted a fourmonth freeze on the 
telescope imposed march 26 by us district judge alfredo marquez 
in tucson marquez was responding to fears the project would lead 
to extinction of the squirrel 
two us fish and wildlife service employees claimed the agency 
had suppressed their reservations about the telescopes effects on 
the squirrel population when it released a 1988 impact report 
the report found no danger to the squirrels survival leading 
to congressional authorization for the project 
the appeals panel said tuesday it did not appear the evidence 
presented to marquez was new information not previously considered 
by congress 
the court specified that the judge could reinstate the freeze 
should subsequent proceedings reveal effects of the project not 
previously considered 
but silver said every major national environmental and 
conservation group joined together to fight this from happening 
this project sets the precedent for abolition of environmental law 
and ignores the fact that alternative less destructive astronomy 
sites exist 
interior secretary manuel lujan provoked an outcry from 
environmentalists last week when he said nobodys told me the 
difference between a red squirrel a black one or a brown one he 
called on congress to weaken the endangered species act 
the act prohibits any development that would harm species on the 
endangered species list

lucille doris and ida are three widows in 
search of a play 
lucille is the saucy one always on the prowl for bargains and a 
new man doris is the sour one practical but suspicious of good 
fortune ida is the sweet one diplomatic and generous to her 
friends and family 
in the course of a long two hours you dont learn much more 
about these charter members of the cemetery club ivan 
menchells tepid little tombstone comedy that opened tuesday at 
broadways brooks atkinson theater 
what its doing there is not entirely clear the play should 
have bypassed broadway altogether and gone directly to summer 
stock dinner theaters and community playhouses but its real home 
is television maybe as a soso movie of the week or golden 
girls on an offnight 
at first the plot seems promising the three friends meet 
regularly at a graveyard in queens talk to their dead husbands and 
wonder how they will get on with their lives to its credit the 
dialogue is not maudlin but its not very interesting either 
their female camaraderie is shattered by the appearance of sam 
the butcher a widower who also makes regular cemetery visits to 
his dead wife sam takes a fancy to ida thats the sweet one 
and suddenly its every woman for herself 
but the play degenerates into a succession of tired jokes about 
perpetual care blue cross philandering husbands gas pains 
jewish weddings and their good friend the muchmarried but 
neverseen selma who is tying the knot again this time with an 
italian 
at selmas wedding reception sam not only escorts ida and her 
friends but brings mildred a predatory woman out to snare the 
mildmannered butcher she causes a rift between ida and sam their 
problems are eventually solved but not before a few tears are shed 
the cast seems stymied by the material particularly eileen 
heckart as the abrasive but really softhearted lucille she plays 
it onenote cute underlining all her laugh lines with her 
honeycoated voice inflections more successful are doris belack as 
the nononsense doris and especially elizabeth franz as ida who 
makes a few of the stickier speeches about getting on with life 
after the death of a spouse affecting 
the sole male role is played by lee wallace who earned murmurs 
of approval from a preview audience because he bears an astonishing 
resemblance to former new york mayor edward koch hes also a 
pretty good actor 
director pamela berlin who had more luck with another 
femalebonding play called steel magnolias cant inject much 
life into the script 
the liveliest moments of the play occur when john lee beattys 
wonderful cemetery set including several rows of headstones rolls 
into view beatty also has come up with a splendid new york skyline 
backdrop for his queens graveyard and when the roar of jet engines 
occasionally interrupts the proceedings it seems more real than 
anything else on stage 
the cemetery club received poor reviews elsewhere 
in the new york post reviewer clive barnes said it is 
certainly within a genre of play that say 30 years ago before the 
age of tv sitcoms and cheapo movies of that same ilk broadway and 
most of its critics would have embraced but i fear these golden 
girls are too late 
and in the new york daily news critic howard kissel said i 
wouldnt be surprised to learn it was originally written as a tv 
pilot which the networks had the good sense to reject 
new york newsday critic leo seligsohn also compared it to 
television the cemetery club is the golden girls marinated 
in chicken soup rarely has a play been so targeted at a particular 
audience as this 
in the new york times drama critic frank rich was a bit more 
ruthless moving at the leisurely pace of a contentious canasta 
hand the cemetery club could be one of the best arguments yet 
advanced for cremation

a us official reacted angrily today 
when the philippines claimed the united states owes it more than 
222 million in compensation and that the debt could jeopardize 
talks on american bases 
at clark air base more than 600 people attended a memorial 
service for two us airmen slain sunday by communist rebels 
opposed to the bases in a message read at the ceremony president 
bush promised their deaths would not deter the united states from 
the cause of freedom 
in manila police arrested 15 people in the third straight day 
of antibases protests coinciding with talks toward a new bases 
agreement they were among 300 people who included roman catholic 
nuns and representatives of 14 nations who tried to march to the 
us embassy but were blocked by police 
filipino delegates complained that the united states had fallen 
short by 2226 million in aid promised to manila to maintain the 
six us military installations whose lease runs out in september 
1991 said rafael alunan spokesman for the philippine panel 
us officials acknowledge only a 96 million shortfall 
alunan warned that the disagreement could jeopardize the talks 
the way i see it that will endanger the future of the talks 
with the united states he said i would like to think that 
both sides are prepared to work out their differences as friends 
and allies are expected to do 
the two sides agreed to set up a committee to study the issue 
however the chief us delegate richard armitage reacted 
angrily to the philippine statement about the outstanding debt a 
spokesman for the us delegation stanley schrager quoted 
armitage as saying he did not stand next to a cash register when 
conducting foreign relations 
the issue of back payments was raised during the third day of 
talks between the united states and the philippines on a new bases 
agreement the two delegations canceled an afternoon session so 
they could attend the memorial service for the two american airmen 
at clark 50 miles north of manila 
the killings of airmen john h raven 19 of delta junction 
alaska and james c green 20 of craig colo were believed 
timed to coincide with the opening of the talks 
us ambassador nicholas platt read bushs message at the 
service 
barbara and i want to express our shock and sorrow at the 
brutal murders of airman john raven and airman james green the 
message said terrorism will not deflect our nation from its 
purpose to preserve and protect democracy and freedom 
foreign secretary raul manglapus chief philippine delegate at 
the bases talks told reporters afterward that he attended to 
stress the position of our government that these acts of killing 
unarmed american soldiers is an act of weakness and diminishes the 
dignity and honor of the people of the philippines 
armitage said the killings will not shake our resolve to see 
the talks through on the bases 
communist rebels claimed responsibility and vowed more attacks 
until all us troops leave the country 
in a related development military dissidents also called for 
the bases to be closed by 1991 the statement was telephoned to 
news organizations by the revolutionary alliance of the 
massessoldiers of the filipino people which led the dec 19 
failed attempt to overthrow president corazon aquino 
meanwhile sources in the us military community said 
restrictions had been further tightened after sundays killing 
at clark airmen formerly housed in civilian hotels were brought 
back to the base the sources said single sailors and marines who 
had been living offpost have been ordered back to barracks at 
subic the sources added 
troops are being billeted in gymnasiums and are doubling up in 
the barracks the sources said on condition of anonymity 
following sundays killings the us military barred offpost 
leaves for the 40000 troops defense department civilians and 
military dependents those living off post were ordered to stay in 
their homes after duty hours

two masked men beat up a high school 
teacher calling her a dirty jew and a dirty arab after 
she devoted a class to racism in response to the desecration of a 
jewish cemetery the teacher said today 
the reported attack was the latest in a series of racist 
incidents since the discovery on thursday of the desecration of 
gravestones and the mutilation of a corpse at carpentras in 
southern france 
also today officials in naples italy said vandals dug up 
tombs and overturned 20 gravestones in a jewish cemetery the 
desecration occurred about two weeks ago but was made public only 
this week by leaders of naples 200member jewish community 
the mayor of naples pietro lezzi met tuesday with jewish 
officials and expressed his indignation 
christiane guiard a history and geography teacher at the emile 
zola college of royan near bordeaux said she was getting out of 
her bathtub monday morning when two masked intruders entered her 
home and beat her 
the reported attack followed several threats in anonymous 
telephone calls she said speaking from her hospital bed 
the men told me dirty jew dirty arab you were warned 
said mrs guiard 41 who suffered several cuts and remained under 
medical surveillance at the malakoff hospital of royan the 
reason i see one its racism 
moslem immigrants have been the target of racist attacks 
extreme rightwing leader jeanmarie le pen who frequently utters 
antisemitic remarks says he favors expelling frances 34 million 
moslem immigrants 
mrs guiard said she used the desecration of the carpentras 
cemetery to teach a class saturday on racism to her 15 and 
16yearold students 
she said she discussed frances antiracism law of 1972 i 
noted to the students that since this law freedom of expression 
still exists of course but that racism in any form is not an 
opinion but a crime 
school principal henry bugnet gave police a complete list of the 
parents of the students who were expected to be questioned by 
police 
the attack was denounced at the national assembly today first 
by the communist group then by health minister claude evin 
since the discovery of the desecration of the carpentras 
cemetery swastikas and neonazi slogans have appeared on buildings 
in several towns and on jewish tombs in a suburban paris cemetery

a scholar for the nations largest ecumenical 
group says the us supreme court weakened religious freedom when 
it said a state could punish two men who used an illegal drug in a 
church ritual 
the main pillar upholding the venerable and precious right of 
religious liberty in the constitution has been virtually 
repealed said dean kelley speaking tuesday at a pittsburgh 
conference of the national council of churches 
needless language in the recent ruling means states easily can 
prosecute people who cite their beliefs as reasons for violating 
laws said kelley the church councils director of religious 
freedom and an authority on churchstate relations 
board members of the council which represents 32 church 
organizations with 42 million members agreed to draft a resolution 
calling for the high court to reconsider the april 17 ruling 
the justices in a 63 decision said oregon officials could 
withhold unemployment pay from two members of the native american 
church who used peyote a hallucinogenic drug derived from a 
cactus as part of their worship 
its not just the indians that caught it in that case its 
all religions including ours kelley said 
this case holds that criminal punishment of the central 
religious ritual of an ancient faith raises no issue under the free 
exercise clause and requires no justification wrote law 
professor douglas laycock of the university of texas in remarks 
prepared for the church council 
the court weakened the freedom of religion clause in the bill of 
rights when justice antonin scalias majority decision said 
prosecutors must show only a rational means to achieve a 
legitimate end to obtain a conviction when religion is used as a 
defense kelley said 
previously the government needed to establish a compelling 
state interest to override the constitutional protection of 
religious freedom he said 
justice sandra day oconnor who voted against the workers but 
dissented from the majority opinion said the court didnt need to 
lift the compelling state interest provision 
its a whole new ball game now kelley said the 
ecumenical communions have tended to be very relaxed about alleged 
threats to religious liberty but the time has come for real 
alarm 
kelley said the high courts ruling affects dozens of pending 
cases involving religious freedom and one faith already has noted 
the effects of the oregon case 
the justices told minnesotas high court to use the peyote 
decision in reconsidering a ruling involving amish farmers in that 
state 
the minnesota justices said the state couldnt enforce a law 
requiring amish buggy drivers to place a bright orange triangle on 
their vehicles the amish considered the triangles garish and 
agreed to use silver reflectors 
in another case in clearwater fla the high courts ruling 
supersedes a federal judges ruling that the city cant force 
churches to disclose financial data if they accept donations 
kelley said 
also 49 states have laws protecting the confidentiality of 
talks between a priest and members of his congregation but the 
high courts ruling could force the clergy to reveal information if 
those states repeal those laws west virginia is the only state 
that doesnt have a law protecting communications with priests

an independent soviet circus stranded in 
suburban atlanta rejected free tickets home because the offer came 
from someone with ties to its competitors 
the great circus bim bom rejected the offer tuesday from a 
businessman who promotes the official moscow circus at the same 
time an atlanta transportation company said it would not release 
the troupes costumes and equipment because it is owed 120000 
forcing a delay in negotiations for new performances 
the moscow circus is our competition they would love to have 
our artists go back to russia said andy trueman managing 
director of the circus whose performers have been living in a 
marietta motel since its twoyear goodwill tour was canceled last 
week 
our artists are better than theirs he added it would 
just be to get us out of town we havent been jumping at the 
offer 
the businessman who offered the tickets steven e leber said 
the bim bom performers would rather be here making no money than 
be there in the soviet union they would like to stay in 
america theyre not anxious to go home he said 
lebers assistance was solicited by soviet officials who fear 
that the problems encountered by the independent bim bom troupe 
will hurt future tours of the successful governmentsponsored 
moscow circus which just completed an eightmonth us tour 
the bim bom circus arrived in the united states march 31 and 
played just two stops before cancelling its tour 
poor advance publicity led to low attendance at shows in 
hershey pa and knoxville tenn and the circus claimed that its 
backers also withdrew support however a lawyer for the backers 
said his clients had merely given the circus a loan and had not 
intended to back the whole tour

earlier in the day west german economics minister helmut 
haussmann urged east germany to start now turning over staterun 
companies to private owners 
haussmann said the bonn government was ready to offer east 
germany 42 billion for restructuring companies after the economic 
merger takes effect 
he said that money would help ease the transition to a market 
economy and massive unemployment it was not clear if that money 
would be separate from the german unity fund 
kohls party the christian democratic union suffered election 
losses in two important west german states on sunday and he since 
has tried to step up the pace of unification including calling for 
allgerman elections as early as this year the defeats apparently 
were caused by concern among voters over the cost of unification 
there have not been any firm estimates of the cost 
the suggestion for early joint elections drew criticism from the 
west german opposition and from east german officials 
although kohl has not suggested a date his chief of staff 
wolfgang schaeuble said allgerman elections could be held on dec 
2 the same date for west german federal elections east germany 
announced tuesday that it plans to hold state elections on the same 
day

prochoice republican barbara hafer won the 
right to challenge antiabortion gov robert p casey in november 
in a race that turns the usual political lineup on abortion upside 
down

percent over marguerite pet luksik who had never sought public 
office before and had no advertising budget luksik was supported 
by righttolife groups 
the campaigns reversed the typical political alignments on 
abortion and the vote tuesday showed that casey was succeeding in 
his effort to buck the national democratic line 
the result is a strong endorsement by the democratic voters of 
this state of our record of the last four years casey said 
they support that agenda though abortion is important he 
said people were just as concerned about his efforts to create 
jobs stop drugs and clean up the environmental 
a lot of republicans that i talked to across pennsylvania 
didnt even know there was a primary hafer said we have to 
remember that the prolifers are very organized they went out and

long lines formed at 
polling places today as dominicans voted in what was seen as a 
close contest between two old foes president joaquin balaguer and 
former president juan bosch 
the voting attracted 30 international observers including 
former president jimmy carter who will work closely with the 
electoral board which tabulates votes from 4000 polling stations 
nationwide 
polls opened closed at 6 pm same time edt and initial 
returns were not expected until after midnight the central 
electoral board said 
by statute businesses are closed today and no liquor sales 
were allowed 
balaguer and bosch both in their 80s were voting separately at 
the same polling station in a santo domingo residential area 
santo domingo was calm tuesday with campaigning commercials 
and newscasts suspended for the day under the countrys election 
law 
police said at least six people were injured outside the capital 
monday night in clashes between opposing political supporters in 
which motorcycles and at least one car were set on fire and rocks 
were thrown at two houses 
balaguer 83 a fivetime president who is blind from glaucoma 
has been running under a campaign slogan balaguer a road without 
danger portraying bosch as a dangerous marxist balaguers 
popularity has declined since the last election four years ago as 
the countrys economic crisis deepened 
bosch 80 elected president in 1963 but ousted only six months 
into his term has described himself as marxist but not a 
communist he has been campaigning as a moderate who will promote 
capitalism and privatization 
carter who arrived with his wife rosalyn on monday night said 
he was invited by electoral commission president froilan tavares 
and will observe balloting to help guard against any fraud 
we are here as objective analysts we will certify if the 
elections have been fair and free carter said 
boschs leftist dominican liberation party has been claiming 
balaguer organizers have prepared 300000 phony ballots to rig 
the vote a charge denied by balaguers conservative social 
christian reformist party 
over the weekend the two candidates drew crowds estimated at 
more than 100000 each to outdoor rallies in santo domingo 
bosch had been leading in opinion polls by 10 points over the 
past year but some observers believe he may be hurt by his 
criticism last week of a 1954 agreement with the vatican providing 
all army chaplains be roman catholic this nation of 7 million 
people which shares the caribbean island of hispaniola with haiti 
is overwhelmingly catholic 
balaguer who briefly served as a figurehead president under 
dictator gen rafael leonidas trujillo won three consecutive 
fouryear terms after his first election in 1966 since his last 
reelection in 1986 he has embarked on a costly publicworks 
program 
he is banking on the popularity of the new homes apartments 
roads and schools to ensure reelection the projects created a 
construction and employment boom but also fueled inflation at a 
time when public services such as electricity are deteriorating 
badly 
among the six other presidential candidates are jose francisco 
pena gomez a former santo domingo mayor and hero of the 1965 civil 
war and jacobo majluta a former vice president who became 
president for 43 days in 1982 after the suicide of president 
antonio guzman majluta finished a close second to balaguer in 1986 
there are 32 million dominicans eligible to vote for president 
vice president 30 senators 120 congressional deputies and 103 
mayors eighteen political parties are fielding candidates

civil libertarians are concerned over a 
new push by the federal government to seize leases from public 
housing tenants suspected of dealing drugs even if they face no 
criminal charges 
the proposal announced tuesday by housing secretary jack kemp 
will target 23 cities nationwide using the asset forfeiture 
provision of the antidrug abuse act of 1988 
meanwhile other bush administration officials were sending 
congress a package of antidrug measures that would give the 
immigration and naturalization service greater authority to deport 
noncitizens without hearings 
duke austin chief spokesman for the service said tuesday the 
plan would add a small number of serious drug offenses such as 
trafficking or possession with intent to distribute to the list 
of serious crimes for which conviction can bring deportation 
without hearings 
those hearings and subsequent appeals can take two years 
among antidrug proposals being sent to congress today to 
implement president bushs updated drug control strategy issued in 
january are proposals that 
allow the death penalty for drug kingpins 
allow the extradition of us citizens to foreign countries 
even if the united states is not obligated by the extradition 
treaties involved 
make drugrelated public corruption punishable by up to 25 
years imprisonment 
allow officials to seize the assets of violators of 
drugparaphernalia statutes and impose civil penalties 
make it a criminal offense not to obey a federal law 
enforcement officers order to land an aircraft or bringto a 
vessel 
kemp described his proposal tuesday saying when the cases 
for forfeiture are filed and approved by the local federal courts 
us marshals will promptly take custody of the apartments from 
which the traffickers are operating 
such an action kemp said specifically targets serious drug 
traffickers because the standard of proof for a forfeiture order 
is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the apartment has been 
used for the commission of a drug felony 
kemp who spoke at a conference hosted by the office of national 
drug control policy declined to identify the 23 cities involved in 
the program 
the american civil liberties union criticized the proposal 
it takes a solid principle of american jurisprudence which 
is that you are innocent until proven guilty and turns it on its 
head said aclu spokeswoman colleen oconnor 
it suggests the governmeninto a means of enforcing the drug 
laws 
kemp noted that civil liberties concerns were raised last year 
when he took steps to speed up evictions of public housing tenants 
involved in drug activity and he said we are carefully 
addressing those concerns 
bud albright jr deputy general counsel for the department of 
housing and urban development said the leasehold seizures by 
public housing authorities working with us attorneys would be 
aimed solely at largescale operations 
but david bryson of the national housing law center said it will 
be difficult to limit the targets once the operation is under way 
the difficulty is once secretary kemp gives out this message 
and starts this ball rolling he has no control over it said 
bryson whose center provides support and legal research to 
attorneys representing lowincome people with housing problems 
the further you get away from the secretary himself the more 
likely that you will have an abuse of power the greater your 
chance is that youll hit somebody who is blinded by the message 
that we have to get these people out and will do anything to get 
them out bryson said 
kemp also announced tuesday that hud is proposing new 
regulations for section 8 rent subsidies under the proposal those 
convicted of drugrelated or violent crimes and evicted from public 
housing will not be allowed to use section 8 vouchers for other 
rental property 
albright said the regulations should be sent to the office of 
management and budget today and should be published in the federal 
register next month 
although congress specifically identified leaseholds as 
forfeitable assets in the 1988 antidrug measure the seizure 
procedure was available earlier to enterprising government 
officials bryson said the new york city housing authority made 
its first seizure of a public housing lease in april 1987 
albright said the new program will be a nationwide hit to 
raise the consciousness of drug dealers and of the public that this 
is something we can use and we intend to use

americans about dangers of smoking

year for expanding research into the smoking habit encouraging 
states to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to 
minors and attempting to reduce smoking by target groups 
including pregnant women and bluecollar workers 
the legislation would allow the government to buy antismoking 
advertisements 
before the bill was approved the committee stripped away 
several contentious provisions including one that would have 
required labels warning that smoking is addictive sen edward m 
kennedy dmass chairman of the subcomittee said those 
provisions may be restored when the senate debates the bill 
despite considerable progress in reducing smoking rates 
throughout the country tobacco products account for onesixth of 
all deaths every year kennedy said too many people 
especially young people have not yet received the message about 
the dangers of smoking 
the bill will be a major step forward in our ongoing 
battle to inform the public and reduce the high toll of death and 
disability that smoking inflicts on our society kennedy said

guards surrounded government buildings in 
the secessionist republic of estonia today after soviet loyalists 
converged on parliament in what the premier called a failed coup 
attempt 
lawmakers in neighboring lithuania began a closeddoor debate on 
new proposals designed to end an impasse with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev calm was reported in all three baltic 
republics 
in moscow secretary of state james a baker iii said he would 
press soviet leaders to explain why they have not begun talks with 
baltic leaders baker is on a fourday visit to make progress on 
arms control before gorbachev and president bush meet in washington 
this month 
in the latvian capital riga about two dozen proindependence 
demonstrators stood outside parliament holding a banner that shows 
a cow made up of the national colors of the three baltic republics 
and a figure of gorbachev sucking on the udder the also held 
latvian flags 
antiindependence protesters in estonia threatened a general 
strike may 21 unless their demands are met by thursday according 
to interfax a news service of radio moscow they want the 
immediate resignation of the republics government a referendum on 
esotnian secession from the soviet union and abolition of the 
resolution on the national status of estonia 
a proindependence newspaper the estonian independent reported 
that estonian prime minister edgar savisaar told baker in a 
telegram about tuesdays attempts by moscow loyalists to occupy 
estonian government buildings 
savisaar told baker the estonian government would be deeply 
surprised were the incidents in estonia and latvia not to find 
reverberation in todays talks 
a crowd estimated at up to 6000 swarmed around estonias 
parliament building in the republics capital tallinn on tuesday 
savisaar broadcast an appeal for citizens to come here to save 
estonia 
there is a coup attempt here he said in the broadcast 
which was monitored in moscow and transcribed by the eta estonian 
news agency in tallinn 
thousands of tallinn residents rushed to the parliament and 
replaced the red soviet flag with the traditional blue white and 
black banner that was raised last week when the legislature 
restored a 1937 independence charter 
proindependence demonstrators formed two human chains through 
which soviet loyalists were allowed to leave the area eta reported 
calm returned to the city by 750 pm estonian reports said 
finnish television said proindependence crowds remained around 
government broadcasting stations during the night to block any 
takeover attempt 
peoples front security guards were stationed around the clock 
at other government buildings eta reported eta estimated the 
moscow loyalists at 2500 and put proindependence forces at 3000 
finnish tv estimated the proindependence crowd at 50006000 and 
the secessionist demonstrators at 20000 the incident lasted just 
over two hours 
the estonian independent said the estonian government late 
tuesday decided to set up a home guard of civilian volunteers 
to protect official buildings so far the buildings have been 
guarded by members of the peoples front a grassroots political 
group 
a similar confrontation occurred tuesday in the latvian capital 
of riga where for the second day whistling and jeering soviet 
soldiers tried to muscle into the parliament building but were 
blocked by proindependence crowds 
it was unclear whether the disturbances in estonia and latvia 
were coordinated from moscow or organized by local soviet loyalists 
the presidents of latvia estonia and lithuania asked bush and 
gorbachev in letters over the weekend to discuss the baltics at 
their summit and to support their independence moves 
gorbachev has called the baltic republics independence 
declarations illegal and has imposed economic sanctions against 
lithuania which declared its independence from moscow on march 11 
latvia declared may 4 that it was passing through a transition 
period to independence estonia had taken a similar step march 30 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze warned of 
anarchy in the baltic republics which were forcibly annexed by 
the soviet union in 1940 
the right to selfdetermination has to be implemented within 
the framework of our constitution if this principle is violated 
then it will mean anarchy i am sure shevardnadze said in an 
interview with cbs 
in moscow radicals at the opening of the russian republics 
congress said today they want to take over the republics affairs 
from the national government and elect a rival of gorbachev as 
their president 
some lawmakers demand that russia secede from the ussr the 
state news agency tass reported the republic contains 52 percent 
of the soviet unions population and threequarters of its land

government officials say theyre moving to 
boost airline security as recommended by a commission on the 1988 
downing of pan am flight 103 but wont immediately cancel plans to 
install new bombdetecting devices criticized by the panel 
the report released tuesday sharply criticized the federal 
aviation administration and others charged with protecting us air 
travelers it called on the government to consider preemptive or 
retaliatory military strikes against terrorist enclaves in other 
countries to combat air terrorism 
its time to punish anyone we can prove took our aircraft 
down said sen frank lautenberg dnj a member of the 
sevenperson panel 
for families of the victims who sought formation of the 
commission against what they called government indifference the 
report marked a victory 
for many of us its been the most satisfying day since dec 
21 1988 when the plane was bombed over lockerbie scotland 
said bert ammerman organizer of the victims of pan am 103 
all the areas and recommendations are an endorsement of what 
weve been asking for said ammerman whose brother thomas was 
killed in the pan am crash 
the presidents commission on aviation security and terrorism 
criticized the faa the state department and pan american world 
airways and recommended major reforms in handling threats to air 
safety 
the panel called for a system to notify passengers of credible 
terrorist threats and said the government should take more 
seriously the possibility of terrorist strikes in the united states 
were pledged to continue to pursue this said lautenberg 
adding that if the recommendations were not enacted through federal 
regulations then were going to be on the senate floor putting 
them into place 
white house and transportation department officials said they 
would consider implementing some of the recommendations that are 
not already in the works 
the faa is doing everything it can to ensure that traveling on 
us airlines is one of the safest and secure ways to travel in the 
world said transportation secretary samuel skinner in a 
statement 
his statement was accompanied by a list of steps the department 
has taken since the pan am crash and he added more are under way 
that we believe reflect the commissions recommendations 
faa administrator james busey said he would continue with plans 
to use six sophisticated thermal neutron analysis tna machines 
the faa has already contracted to purchase but will await the 
results of studies before deciding whether to change plans for 
broader installation 
the commission asked that an order requiring airlines to 
purchase and install the units at highrisk airports be deferred 
until they can be proved to be more effective in detecting small 
amounts of plastic explosives 
faa units already are operating in new york and miami and one is 
being installed in london the commission said the machines as 
currently being operated likely would not have detected the 
lockerbie bomb but it recommended going ahead with installation of 
the first six for testing purposes 
some relatives of victims said they disagreed with the proposal 
to halt installation of the devices 
the commission said the lockerbie disaster in which 270 people 
on the plane and on the ground died may well have been 
preventable 
and it said the federal effort to ensure aviation safety is 
seriously flawed and has failed to provide the proper level of 
protection 
without doubt the faas performance was nothing short of 
dismal said one commission member sen alfonse damato rny 
commissioners recommended creating a position of assistant 
secretary of transportation for aviation security and intelligence 
busey said he welcomed the suggestion for organizational 
changes but chafed at some of the adjectives used to describe 
the faa 
the system was flawed mistakes were made i want to own up to 
those mistakes said busey who took over the faa several months 
after the bombing he said the agency has taken significant steps 
to improve security but we have more work to do 
the report recommended a more vigorous us policy that not 
only pursues and punishes terrorists but also makes state sponsors 
of terrorism pay a price for their actions 
the report recommended planning and training for preemptive 
or retaliatory military strikes against known terrorist enclaves in 
nations that harbor them 
where such direct strikes are inappropriate the commission 
recommends a lesser option including covert operations to 
prevent disrupt or respond to terrorist acts 
the white house declined to comment on specific recommendations 
we certainly agree that we need to be as aggressive as 
necessary to fight terrorism said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett said he disagreed with some of 
the commissions criticisms of the airline but said the report made 
several positive recommendations 
the report strongly criticized pan am for security flaws at 
frankfurts airport where flight 103 originated 
in a fullpage advertisement in the washington post and the new 
york times pan am said the us government and other governments 
have not provided meaningful support in combating terrorism 
directed against civil aviation 
pan am called for establishment of a uniform international 
standard of procedures for airline security adding that money from 
the federal aviation trust fund could be used to help implement 
such a program

falling costs for vegetables fuel oil and 
womens clothing helped hold consumer price inflation to 02 
percent in april the government said today 
it was the smallest increase since september and the first 
moderate report after a severe cold snap sent prices spiraling 11 
percent in january the labor departments consumer price index had 
risen 05 percent in both february and march 
were correcting from the unusually high prices of the 
winter said economist donald ratajczak of georgia state 
university you could argue the worst of inflation is behind 
us certainly for this year 
in a separate report the commerce department said housing 
starts plummeted 58 percent in april to their lowest level since 
the 1982 recession it was the third drop in a row 
interest rates reacting to the evidence of quiescent inflation 
and anemic economic growth inched lower in early trading on the 
bond market 
the inflation number was expected but the housing number was 
not together the reports were taken as a sign the federal reserve 
would have no need to raise rates to battle inflation 
however even with the april improvement inflation for the 
first four months of the year was running at a 68 percent 
seasonally adjusted annual rate up from 46 percent for all of 
1989 
in april food and beverage prices fell 02 percent the first 
decline since july 1987 nonalcoholic beverages and dairy products 
were down while prices rose for cereal and bakery products beef 
pork sweets and oils 
fresh vegetable prices which rose 292 percent in the first two 
months of the year fell 155 percent last month bringing the 
decline for april and march to 198 percent 
energy prices dropped 04 percent after declining the two 
previous months gasoline prices with the start of the warm 
weather driving season climbed 03 percent and electricty costs 
were up 02 percent however fuel oil fell 06 percent the third 
consecutive decline while natural gas dropped 30 percent 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices rose a 
moderate 02 percent after rising a worrisome 07 percent in march 
economists say this core number is often a better indicator of 
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy 
new automobile prices fell 02 percent in april clothing price 
inflation moderated from a month earlier apparel prices overall 
were unchanged after rising 17 percent in march 
womens and girls clothing costs fell 05 percent however 
mens and boys clothing costs were up 04 percent while infants 
and toddlers costs rose 19 percent 
health care costs rose a steep 08 percent the third increase 
in a row at that level they were up 89 percent from a year ago 
the various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 
1289 in april that means a hypothetical selection of goods that 
cost 100 in the 198284 base period cost 12890 last month up 
from 12310 a year earlier 
separately the department said americans average weekly 
earnings after adjusting for inflation increased 02 percent last 
month however over the past year real weekly earnings were down 
17 percent 
so far this year wholesale prices as measured by the 
governments producer price index have recovered from the winter 
weather shocks much more swiftly than consumer prices as a result 
wholesale prices for the first four months of the year have risen 
at a more moderate annual rate of 42 percent 
analysts attribute the slower recovery of consumer prices to the 
heavy influence of the service sector which accounts for slightly 
more than 50 percent of the consumer index and none of the 
wholesale index 
the economic slowdown of recent months has slowed demand for 
goods pulling down wholesale costs but until very recently it 
hasnt affected employment 
economist robert brusca of nikko securities co international 
inc said sluggishness in the goodsproducing sector of the economy 
may finally be spreading to services 
i think were breaking the upward trend of inflation that was 
introduced earlier in the year he said 
despite the firstquarter surge brusca forecasts an increase in 
consumer prices for all of 1990 of about 43 percent 
other analysts however are less optimistic the consensus of 
51 top economists surveyed earlier thas month by blue chip economic 
indicators of sedona ariz called for a 47 percent rise 
brusca argued that the improvement in inflation will be enough 
to allow the federal reserve to stimulate economic growth with 
lower interest rates policymakers for the central bank met behind 
closed doors tuesday and many economists predicted they would hold 
monetary policy steady until clearer evidence emerges of the 
economys direction

environmental officials from 34 countries 
today approved a declaration that calls for protecting the worlds 
ecology but they shied away from making recommendations to deal 
with specific problems 
the united states stalled several proposals it considered too 
costly or unattinable including one for a new international fund 
to help developing countries 
chief us delegate john a knauss expressed satisfaction with 
the outcome of the environmental conference and the declaration 
i believe the way the document is written should not cause 
concern over rising taxes he said 
but environmentalists criticized it as vague and watered down 
greenpeace the international environmental group said in a 
statement that the conferences failure to agree on actions for 
specific problems sends out an ominous signal to the rest of the 
world 
it referred to the meeting as the bergen fiasco 
the us delegation conceded a major issue when it agreed to the 
socalled precautionary principle which calls for measures to 
protect the environment even when scientific proof of their benefit 
is lacking 
future policies should take the precautionary principle into 
consideration scientific uncertainties should not prevent concrete 
measures to limit environmental destruction the document said 
the americans and most east bloc nations also objected to 
setting new targets for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions they 
advised waiting until a un report on global climate change is 
published this fall 
the declaration issued a general call for building more public 
transportation systems help for eastern europe and the third world 
in cleaning up its environment and better labeling of products 
the united states refused to approve new funds for ozone 
research and protection and the document only called on each 
country to take appropriate action

just when it seemed aerial spraying against 
the medfly would be winding down los angeles county supervisors 
have paved the way for spraying against a new pest the mexfly 
supervisors voted tuesday to declare a state of emergency to 
give the county legal immunity in the event of accidents and 
lawsuits related to antimexfly malathion spraying which is being 
overseen by the state 
the vote came hours before helicopters sprayed malathion over a 
57squaremile area encompassing suburban compton and south gate 
overnight to eradicate mexflies officials discovered two mexican 
fruit flies in compton on may 3 and may 8 
after another helicopter spraying in two weeks officials plan 
to release sterile laboratorybred mexflies in the area to stop 
breeding 
the mexican fruit fly attacks more than 40 types of fruit 
primarily citrus and stone fruit the fly is established in mexico 
parts of central america and in texas lower rio grande valley 
supervisor ed edelman who voted against the emergency decree 
questioned the states eradication strategy 
im wondering if it makes sense to embark on the same 
eradication program on the mexican fruit fly which hasnt worked 
as it was supposed to on the medfly edelman said i think its 
time to move on to other strategies 
gov george deukmejian signed declarations of emergency monday 
for los angeles and san diego counties to authorize the pesticide 
missions several mexflies also have been found in el cajon east 
of san diego 
meanwhile other cities on tuesday continued their fight to stop 
pesticide spraying against the mediterranean fruit fly 
los angeles glendale and burbank will fight a motion by the 
state to have a judge from another county hear a lawsuit that seeks 
to stop spraying an attorney said tuesday 
the states motion is an attempt to obtain a judge from an 
agricultural area more sympathetic to the aerial pesticide spraying 
program said keith pritsker los angeles deputy city attorney 
los angeles and the two neighboring cities filed the suit in 
february 
the medfly affects more than 250 varieties of fruit and 
vegetables and state officials say threatens californias 
multibilliondollar farm economy 
critics claim more research is needed into malathions possible 
health effects state agricultural officials counter the amount of 
malathion being sprayed poses no health threat

the northern state of slovenia 
today established the first regional noncommunist government in 
yugoslavia in almost 50 years and announced plans to abolish its 
secret police 
premierelect lojze peterle head of slovenias christian 
democratic party also said slovenia would strive to form its own 
army westernize its communiststyle police force and seek greater 
autonomy 
we will press for a confederation in yugoslavia based on the 
freely expressed will of its peoples peterle said in his 
inaugural speech to parliament he added without elaboration that 
this would be done through constitutional means 
peterle told the state legislature he had succeeded in forming a 
cabinet supported by demos a sixparty coalition that won last 
months first free elections the legislature subsequently approved 
his cabinet 
among new cabinet members is janez jansa a prominent former 
anticommunist dissident who was sentenced to 18 months in jail in 
1988 for allegedly revealing military secrets he was elected 
slovenias new defense minister 
all the parties within demos the largest of which are the 
christian democrats will be represented in the new 27member 
government alenka leskovec a parliamentary spokeswoman said in an 
interview 
debate on whether the yugoslav federation of six republics and 
two provinces should be turned into a looser confederation of 
states cooperating voluntarily has pitted slovenia and neighboring 
croatia against serbia whose hardline communist leadership favors 
a strong central government 
during the election campaign demos had demanded that slovenia 
proclaim its full sovereignty and secede from yugoslavia but after 
its victory the coalition has backed off from demanding full 
independence 
multiparty elections have also been held in croatia where a 
centerright government is due to be officially installed at the 
end of may after the ruling communists were defeated 
except for serbia all other member states also have scheduled 
free elections serbias communist authorities have not yet 
legalized opposition parties and have opposed the introduction of 
westernstyle democracy 
in his inaugural speech peterle said slovenias large financial 
contribution to the federal government was stifling economic 
growth in his republic yugoslavias most prosperous region he 
also urged that funding be reduced particularly for the military 
budget 
yugoslavias influential and communistdominated armed forces 
have long been at odds with slovenia over that republics demands 
for less military meddling in the countrys political life 
slovene politicians and the regions media have in the past 
repeatedly accused the army leadership of being under the sway of 
serbias hardline communist authorities 
changes will have to be implemented in the militarydefense 
field peterle declared adding that his government would strive 
for an independent slovene army 
he also said the republics communiststyle police force would 
be remodeled along western lines and that the secret political 
police would be abolished

ministers later convinced the president it wasnt necessary to meet 
their demands

at a roadblock on the outskirts of the airport other soldiers 
carrying loaded weapons said they were only being paid 14 a month 
and that they had to buy their uniforms and shoes they showed 
reporters tears in their uniforms and holes in their shoes 
the soldiers claimed the defense minister had become a 
millionaire by taking money due them they also claimed that 
millions of dollars had been collected for a fund set up last year 
to combat security problems in the country but they had not seen a 
cent of it 
the soldiers asked whether they would accept new promises to 
improve their conditions said we keep our weapons with us 24

water from a swollen reservoir roared 
through floodgates in an ever more powerful flow today as the first 
flood crest reached the dam threatening to swamp 200 square miles 
of southeastern texas 
parts of arkansas flooded since may 1 were declared a disaster 
area tuesday by president bush on the red river which climbed 
toward a 45year high national guardsmen worked to shore up a 
weakened levee protecting the town of garland 
in louisiana gov buddy roemer flew over flooded regions of his 
state today to check out damage caused by the red river col frank 
skidmore of the army corps of engineers told him 700000 acres of 
farms and woods would be inundated by the muddy water 
elsewhere heavy rain pelted waterlogged central and southern 
illinois overnight causing flooding that forced the evacuation of 
several families in vermilion and macon counties 
in washington the federal emergency management agency today 
extended a presidential disaster area to four more texas counties 
making a total of 33 counties eligible for government assistance 
because of severe weather and flooding since april 15 
the trinity river in texas was carrying flood crests from 
torrential rain two weeks ago in the dallas area and from heavy 
rain last week upriver near crockett the first of the crests 
crossed lake livingston today as the water flowed southward 
this is the front end of it this is just the beginning 
said liberty county emergency management coordinator jim mitchum 
the water released from the lake livingston dam flooded areas 
where some 7000 residents were warned to evacuate it was the 
worst flooding in texas in 80 years 
the trinity river authority released water at a record rate of 
88000 cubic feet per second tuesday and today through the gates of 
the dam 
discharges later today were likely to pass 90000 cubic feet 
and the 100000 level was expected by monday said grady manis the 
authoritys southern region manager he said that level was likely 
to be sustained for six to eight days 
roads leading into more than 15 subdivisions in wooded areas 
along the river in liberty county were already covered with water 
although many homes probably will have some flood damage 
mitchum said he does not expect entire subdivisions to be wiped out 
by the heavy current 
we will not be washed down the trinity river into the gulf of 
mexico he added 
manis said he expected the worst flooding on monday 
below lake livingston dam theres about 990 square miles 
maybe 20 percent of that is probably going to be underwater at the 
height of this 
the area threatened is about 50 miles south of the dam and 60 
miles northeast of houston many residents heeded early warnings 
and moved to higher ground some of those who chose to stay lost 
their nerve and called for help 
now theyve become frightened and they want out said jim 
mitchum liberty county emergency management coordinator 
heavy rain in past weeks also caused flooding in oklahoma and 
kansas 
the flooding has been blamed for one death in oklahoma and 13 in 
texas including a 25yearold cleanup worker swept away tuesday 
near texarkana 
the red river sent water deeper over louisiana cropland today 
but officials said it may have crested in shreveport earlier and 
lower than expected 
the red crested tuesday at shreveport at 345 feet nearly a 
foot below the crest initially predicted for today and 45 feet 
above flood stage the difference was attributed to better 
absorption of water upstream and less than expected effects from 
recent rain in oklahoma and arkansas 
the worst is over but were not quite out of the woods yet 
said ernest ethridge chief meteorologist at the national weather 
service in shreveport 
its the worst flood weve had here in my lifetime said 
rep jim mccrery rla who toured the region 
the water had forced 225 people out of their homes in the 
shreveportbossier city area of northwestern louisiana an 
additional 135 were flooded out downstream in rapides natchitoches 
and red river parishes 
the red river in arkansas began to abate on tuesday and 
officials said they could concentrate on cleaning up in kansas 
city daylong downpours caused creeks and rivers to overflow and 
forced hundreds of people from their homes 
weve been saying that this was going to be a truly 
devastating flood and it looks like it will be said judge 
dempsie henley in liberty county we dont have any historical 
data to compare what the damages and losses could be 
at the rattlesnake ranch in houston county partowner and 
manager john merriwether estimated losses in cattle homes fences 
and property will exceed 1 million statewide agriculture losses 
have been put at 500 million 
we lost cattle but how many cattle we dont know said 
merriwether probably a lot of them are floating now

the investigation into the assassination of 
sen robert f kennedy should be reopened to look at the mystery of 
one or more extra bullets say scholars who have studied the 
massive files 
the demand to reopen the kennedy case coincides with tonights 
airing of nbctvs unsolved mysteries which reexamines the 
secondgun theory in the midst of the may ratings sweeps period 
gregory stone a political scientist who spent nearly two years 
studying material from state archives said tuesday it is possible 
that at least nine bullets and perhaps as many as 12 were fired in 
the pantry of the ambassador hotel on the night of june 5 1968 
when kennedy was slain 
the convicted assassin sirhan b sirhan carried a 22caliber 
revolver that held eight bullets 
after 22 years it is not acceptable to allow fundamental 
questions to remain unanswered about the murder of one of the 
greatest public figures of our time stone told a news conference 
significant new evidence has recently surfaced suggesting that 
more shots may have been fired during the assassination of sen 
robert kennedy than could have been discharged by sirhan sirhan 
acting alone he said 
stone called for the los angeles county district attorney and 
the county board of supervisors to reopen the investigation 
the socalled second gun theory has haunted the kennedy case for 
years raising persistent speculation that someone else in the 
pantry fired shots that night 
the researchers did not speculate on who a second gunman might 
have been 
cmdr william booth spokesman for the police department said 
the secondgun theory was thoroughly explored by investigators he 
dismissed stones allegations as a rehash of old material 
there are no plans to reopen the investigation unsolved 
mysteries is reviving the howmanyguns theory they havent 
presented anything that hasnt been presented before booth said 
kennedy was hit three times and five other bullets hit 
bystanders who survived police have said seven of the bullets 
were recovered 
others appearing at the news conference included author dan 
moldea philip melanson a professor and author former fbi agent 
william bailey and david mendelsohn a tv producer who has 
researched the case 
new evidence cited by the group included moldeas recent 
interviews with five police officers involved in the investigation 
who said they remembered seeing bullet holes in a door frame which 
has since been destroyed some said they heard that bullets were 
removed from the frame

the senate pushing aside objections by sen 
jesse helms is moving toward a vote on a 600millionayear bill 
to help states and cities cope with the costs of aids 
passage was assured both sides said as more than twothirds of 
the senates members 67 were cosponsors of the bill 
the senate voted 953 on tuesday to limit debate a procedural 
step made necessary to proceed after helms rnc erected 
parliamentary roadblocks 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine tentatively scheduled 
a vote for today as the senate resumed considering amendments 
sen edward kennedy dmass called the overwhelming vote 
tuesday a clear signal the senate intends to approve the measure 
a similar bill was approved by the house energy and commerce 
committee and awaits floor action it contains some different 
provisions and would authorize the spending of more than 800 
million a year 
the senate agreed to a series of amendments to the bill 
including one dedicating it to ryan white who died april 8 at the 
age of 18 his sixyear struggle against the disease and the 
discrimination it brought won him widespread attention and 
admiration 
the spirit of this brave and gallant young person is very much 
a part of this legislation kennedy said 
whites mother watched from the senate gallery as the senate 
debated the bill jeanne white of cicero ind later said she was 
angered by a charge by helms that homosexuals were cynically 
exploiting her sons death to push their own causes 
i was very irate about it she said 
ryan didnt feel like that at all i felt he was putting words 
in my mouth and in ryans mouth she said ryan always felt he 
did not blame anybody so why should you 
white contracted the disease through a blood transfusion 
homosexual contact and illegal intravenous drug injections are 
primary methods of transmitting the disease 
helms acknowledging his objections would be futile charged 
that too much money as being spent on aids at the expense of other 
diseases and that the money would encourage homosexuality 
what originally began as a measured response to a public 
health emergency has become a weapon frankly for the 
deterioration if not the destruction of americas judeochristian 
value system he said 
kennedy charged helms with misrepresenting and distorting the 
bill 
the senate agreed to an amendment requiring states or local 
governments to receiving money under the measure to carry out what 
they decide is an appropriate program of notification of partners 
of people testing positively for the aidscausing virus 
it rejected on a 6533 vote an amendment offered by sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo that would let states with fewer than 100 cases of 
aids to spend their share of the money on other diseases 
supporters of the bill criticized helms arguments that aids was 
spread through immorality 
we dont reject the cancer patient who didnt try to stop 
smoking said sen orrin hatch rutah 
helms home state of north carolina is a major producer of 
tobacco 
only sens gordon humphrey rnh and steven symms ridaho 
joined helms in voting against the debate limitation 
supporters described the measure as emergency relief for 
communities and public health systems overburdened by patients with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the bill provides 300 million for metropolitan areas with the 
largest number of aids patients atlanta boston chicago dallas 
houston los angeles miami new york newark nj philadelphia 
san francisco san juan puerto rico and washington dc 
those areas have reported 60 percent of the nations aids cases 
sponsors said the money would be used to care for aids patients 
and for support programs 
another 300 million would go to states to develop comprehensive 
aids care programs

armys third brigade no army representative has been a member of 
the peace delegation since president alfredo cristiani was 
inaugurated in may 1989 
cristianis usbacked government and the rebels signed a 
preliminary agreement in geneva on april 4 that set the framework 
for new rounds of talks it established as the main objectives 
political accords leading to a ceasefire and respect for the 
rights of the civilian population 
most of the 71000 killed in the war were civilians 
this round of negotiations is the resumption of talks broken off 
by the guerrillas following the union hall bombing in november 
a few days later the guerrillas launched a major offensive that 
left more than 1000 people dead most of them in san salvador the 
rebels withdrew after failing to defeat the army and without the 
popular uprising the rebels had hoped to instigate in the capital 
rebel demands have moderated significantly in recent years at 
first they focused on sharing power and the integration of the 
government and guerrilla armies now they stress democratic reforms 
and a purge of army officers suspected of belonging to death squads 
cristiani seems to have accepted the idea that some highranking 
officers will have to leave the ranks 
a month ago when cristiani came to caracas for talks with 
perez he said he was willing to along with restructuring of 
the army but he was quick to defend it from any charges of death 
squad involvement

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
may 11 
capital journal pierre sd on the family leave bill 
the house of representatives which obviously has nothing better 
to do has decided to tell american business how to treat its 
employees 
the house approved a bill that would guarantee unpaid leave of 
up to 12 weeks for medical reasons or for the care of a new or ill 
child parent or spouse the bill exempts businesses with fewer 
than 50 workers 
the bill passed despite a threatened veto by president bush now 
the bill goes to the senate where hopefully keener minds will 
prevail 
its galling to see an outfit that cant balance a budget try to 
tell the business community whats right for its employees 
business and industry are swamped with federal red tape already 
now the government is again mandating benefits and making life 
tougher for people who keep this country working 
our lawmakers have to realize that they cant mandate americas 
character as a kinder gentler nation

statesman journal salem ore on the family leave bill 
in the interests of supporting family values and an efficient 
work force president bush should withdraw his threat to veto a 
family leave bill 
the federal bill approved by the house supports 
several important economic and ethical issues one is the now 
obvious fact that our economy cannot function without the skills of 
women workers and that many families cannot function without a 
wifes paycheck 
anything that helps women work helps the economy these economic 
facts are beyond argument 
at the same time as president bush and others have said many 
times we must encourage strong family relationships and help 
couples who want a family but who might in some circumstances 
choose abortion if having a child meant that the mother could not 
work 
most of all workers should be allowed to spend time at home to 
care for a new baby or a sick relative it is not only the humane 
thing to do it is the practical thing 
family leave is hardly likely to be exploited even with medical 
benefits paid by a company few employees could afford to remain 
away from work longer than is absolutely necessary

kenosha wis news on the family leave bill 
does george bush ever rue the day his speechwriters came up with 
the phrase kinder gentler probably not he himself seems a 
relatively kind and gentle man but when he watches his political 
opponents turn the slogan into a partisan club there must be some 
grinding of the presidential teeth 
the white house announced the other day that it would veto a 
family leave bill now in congress the presidents decision is 
good public policy but one of the bills boosters immediately told 
reporters i cant believe the kinder gentler president is going 
to veto this bill 
it would be helpful if policy provisions were discussed 
according to their merits rather than the moral makeup of the 
person who holds them sadly politics doesnt work that way the 
president should stick to his position nevertheless

former hostage frank reed is starting to irritate us 
since his return to the united states after spending 3 years in 
captivity in lebanon reed has kept officials off balance with his 
dr jekyll and mr hyde comments 
one day reed says he understands and accepts the governments 
handling of the hostage crisis the next day he blasts the 
president because he refuses to negotiate for the hostages still in 
captivity 
reed must take some responsibility for his kidnapping he was 
abducted in lebanon after the united states advised its citizens to 
leave the middle east because it could not guarantee their safety 
reed ignored the advice he said he thought his conversion to 
the moslem faith would protect him 
he was wrong 
now after making a colossal blunder reed is trying to talk the 
government into making another mistake he wants the united states 
to throw caution and its hostage policy to the wind and negotiate 
for the six americans still held hostage 
reed said he and four other hostages once had some notsonice 
thoughts about people who we thought werent willing to trade for 
our lives 
mr reed those same people you are complaining about warned all 
americans to leave the middle east why didnt you listen

akron ohio beacon journal on secondhand smoke 
the environmental protection agency has fanned the flames of the 
smoking debate with a comprehensive study on the hazards of 
secondhand cigarette smoke 
the study is about what you would expect people who dont smoke 
themselves but are exposed to cigarette smoke are at a greater risk 
of dying from cancer or other smoking related diseases 
the epa draft report attributes 3000 deaths annually to cancers 
caused by secondhand smoke other illnesses cause more deaths 
children of smokers are a particular concern 
reaction to this news also was predictable the tobacco industry 
said the study proved nothing a philip morris official said the 
report was based on 24 studies 18 of which showed no danger from 
secondhand smoke and three showed that breathing other peoples 
cigarette smoke was actually good for you where do they get these 
guys 
the point is that even though the conclusions are preliminary 
the findings are good information from a good source that a danger 
exists and the report provides ammunition for antismoking groups 
employers and sympathetic lawmakers to extend regulation of smoking 
in public areas and workplaces

the santa fe nm new mexican on bushs environmental policy 
environmental policymaking in the white house of late has 
caused us to muse on that strange animal the ostrich an 
ostrichlike posture if you keep your head in the sand long enough 
the problem with go away allows the president to ignore the 
compelling ecological signs that action must be taken now 
protection of the ozone layer is a leading case in point holes 
in the ozone layer put us all at risk developed and developing 
nations alike yet over the objections of environmental protection 
agency chief william k reilly the bush administration recently 
welched on its commitment to put 20 million a year into a new 
environmental fund for financial and technical assistance to 
developing nations this fund would help developing nations phase 
out chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that deplete the 
protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere 
over the past 40 years the united states has set an example for 
the world weve empowered many nations to do good things to 
rebuild their shattered economies to establish stable democracies 
the president should be providing global leadership on this and 
other critical environmental issues not sticking his head in the 
sand

the greenwood miss commonwealth on the delta commission 
report 
even before the lower mississippi delta development commissions 
report gets a chance for a full airing some critics have begun 
to surface 
they charge that the report wasnt worth the money it cost so 
far the commission has spent one and a half years and 24 million 
in producing the 186page report the total could reach 3 million 
by the time the commission goes out of existence sept 30 
its true that much of the depressing findings in the study of 
this povertystricken area are wellknown to the people who live 
here high rates of illiteracy and school dropouts high 
unemployment and a low per capita income a heavy dependency on 
federal welfare high infant mortality rates and large areas of 
substandard housing too many unskilled workers and too few 
highpaying jobs 
but the critics at home miss the point they and most of the 
people who live in the sevenstate region studied by the delta 
commission are well aware of the problems but a goal of the delta 
commission was to convince president bush and congress who dont 
know the problems firsthand that the delta needs help from the 
federal government 
if the delta commissions report is to do more than gather dust 
it had to be persuasive and comprehensive from what weve read 
about the study it is that not only does the report fully outline 
the problems but its 10year economic development plan contains 
more than 400 recommendations many of which are steps the region 
should take to help itself without any federal expenditures 
we hope that the delta commission gets more than a sympathetic 
ear from the president and congress in many respects parts of the 
delta are like the impoverished third world nations of asia africa 
or south america it doesnt make sense for this nation to send 
foreign aid to help third world nations while continuing to ignore 
similar conditions in our own backyard

we think for the sake of thoroughness the census bureau ought 
to make it possible for these folks to sign on in the national head 
count this should be worked out with us embassies abroad to make 
their inclusion as simple as possible 
if the census bureau can worry about the plumbing in us

right thing to do for the sake of a complete count

iranian and european community officials 
met today at irans request raising modest hopes of progress 
toward freeing western hostages in lebanon 
hussein moussavian irans top official on west european 
affairs made no comment as he arrived at medieval dublin castle to 
meet officials from ireland france and italy there were no 
statements issued after the meeting 
the meeting was the first such gathering since iran appointed an 
ambassador to the european community in march an irish foreign 
ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity said iran 
asked for the talks 
irish officials had said the talks were likely to focus on 
irans wish to improve trade relations but that the europeans would 
bring up the plight of hostages believed held by proiranian shiite 
moslem groups in lebanon 
the meeting set to last two hours went on for nearly three it 
was relatively lowlevel involving foreign ministry political 
directors padraig murphy of ireland bertrand dufourcg of france 
and enzo perlot of italy 
eight of the westerners missing in lebanon four britons a 
dual british and irish national an italian and two west germans 
are from european community states 
also missing are two swiss red cross workers and six americans 
including the longestheld hostage terry a anderson anderson 
the chief middle east correspondent of the associated press was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
ireland has been increasing efforts for the release of dual 
national brian keenan a teacher seized in 1986 
former hostage robert polhill an american who was held with 
keenan and british journalist john mccarthy before being freed last 
month says keenan wants to be considered irish and is highly 
critical of britains policy of refusing to negotiate with 
kidnappers 
there had been speculation that if todays talks went well 
britain and iran would start direct talks abut the fate of keenan 
mccarthy and church of england envoy terry waite 
iran and britain broke diplomatic relations in february 1989 
after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for the death of british 
author salman rushdie khomeini accused rushdie of blaspheming 
islam in his novel the satanic verses 
paul cooper brother of british businessman roger cooper who 
has been jailed without trial in tehran for five years arrived in 
dublin from britain to appeal to moussavian for his brothers 
release 
as far as my brother is concerned there has been a great 
miscarriage of justice cooper said 
but he added i dont blame iran this type of thing can 
happen anywhere

jakarta indonesia post on us bases in the philippines 
major developments taking place in the past few years caused 
to a large degree by mikhail gorbachevs perestroika and glasnost 
policies and the strong desire of the us congress to reduce 
military spending have significantly changed the cold war nature 
of global politics 
they unavoidably must have influenced the setting of the 
negotiating meeting between the philippines delegation led by 
foreign secretary raul manglapus and the us delegation led by 
washingtons special negotiator richard armitage 
for the philippines it is clear that whatever the case the 
american bases will eventually have to go it is not an expression 
of excessive and belated nationalism to say that for an independent 
and sovereign nation in southeast asia today it would be 
anachronistic to still cling to the view that it is necessary to 
have foreign military base on its territory 
what is lacking so far on the american side is the ability or 
willingness to see the need for gradually phasing out the us 
presence in the philippines within the larger context of a 
comprehensive us policy for southeast asia

the nation bangkok thailand on us bases in the philippines 
there is more at stake in the talks on us bases in the 
philippines than just the bases in the rapidly changing world and 
in the continuing crises of the philippines the inherent stability 
the bases bring would be welcome thailand already is on record as 
favoring continuation of a us military presence in the region 
given the diminishing tension among the superpowers and the 
growing trend of reduced military spending by many countries around 
the world a case can be argued in favor of phasing out clark air 
force base and subic bay naval base 
on the other side of the coin a continued us presence in the 
philippines can also be viewed in a positive light as a regional 
security deterrent useful until such time as peace and economic 
cooperation between countries of differing political ideologies in 
the region become firmly rooted 
striking a proper balance between these conflicting concerns is 
not easy but it could well be to the advantage of the 
philippines and the region as a whole for the manila government to 
negotiate a schedule that would allow the continuation of the bases 
for another period of time before the eventual phasing out

the sunday telegraph london on south africa 
is south africa too important to be left to south africans 
even black ones the orthodox reply is that all countries have the 
right to selfgovernment regardless of how they will misuse it 
that orthodoxy has resulted in one african state after another 
being allowed to go to hell in its own way 
in the main this has not mattered much except to the miserable 
inhabitants themselves famine apart the rest of the world has 
looked the other way let ill alone has been the white mans motto 
south africa is different south africa is a serious country 
what happens there matters nor does it matter only to the west it 
matters almost equally to the soviet union chaos in the gold and 
diamond markets might be the last straw that broke the back of the 
soviet economy 
no new constitutional settlement entrenching white rights has 
any serious chance of lasting unless it is guaranteed policed and 
in effect upheld by the great powers the united states russia 
and western europe conventional wisdom will dismiss such idea as 
wildly fanciful 
so in many ways it is but it is far less wildly fanciful than 
the orthodox assumption that whites and blacks in south africa 
left to their own devices have a chance in hell of living happily 
ever after if the outside world is serious about helping south 
africa it will have to do more about ensuring the right results

el mercurio santiago chile on the communist party in italy 
the collapse of the entire eastern european bloc in late 1989 
and the weakening of the ideological faith in the soviet union 
itself have led the italian communist party to the brink of a 
situation nobody would have imagined a few years ago a discussion 
about abandoning the commuist doctrine 
the setback suffered by the communist party in recent regional 
elections will certainly heighten the partys internal debate 
whatever the outcome of the discussion might be the fact 
remains that this is a party that has lost faith in its old creed 
thus it does not seem remote the time when the communists may join 
in alliances with socialist and liberal groups

a kind of vaccine that protects plants 
against pests can reduce reliance on hazardous pesticides the 
vaccines developer says 
the vaccine involves the insertion of bacteria called endophytes 
into a plants seeds the bacteria have been genetically engineered 
to carry a naturally occurring protein that kills inects said 
peter s carlson who developed the vaccine 
as the plant grows the endophytes spread the protein throughout 
the plant he said tuesday at a rockefeller foundation seminar on 
agricultural research 
this is something brand new he said no one ever thought 
of using endophytes before 
researchers reported in the journal of the national cancer 
institute tuesday that flour mill workers had a cancer rate nine 
times that of grain workers not exposed to the chemicals the 
researchers suspected but did not prove that exposure to pesticides 
in grain storage was the cause 
reports like that are encouraging researchers to find 
alternatives to pesticides 
david pimentel of cornell university in ithaca ny estimates 
that pesticides poison 500000 people around the world annually 
resulting in 10000 deaths 
furthermore the public health and environmental problems 
associated with pesticides are costing the us government 3 
billion per year pimentel said at the seminar 
carlson who founded crop genetics international in hanover md 
to produce the plant vaccine has completed two years of field 
tests of corn that had been vaccinated to protect it against the 
european corn borer 
this pest a tiny caterpillar destroys 500 million worth of 
corn per year in the united states said carlson 
the vaccine has proven to be safe and the tests have shown that 
the genetically engineered endophytes dont spread appreciably into 
neighboring plants carlson said 
unlike human vaccines the plant vaccine does not boost the 
plants immune system to ward off pests the endophytes are 
genetically engineered to include a gene from a bacterium called 
bacillus thuringiensis 
once that gene has been put into the endophytes they make a 
bacillus thuringiensis protein that kills the european corn borer 
the endophytes spread through the corn plant as it grows 
causing it no harm but carrying the insecticidal protein with them 
when corn borers move into the corn stem where they feed they 
encounter the protein and are killed 
conventional insecticides are not too effective against corn 
borers carlson said because the insecticides do not get inside 
the corn plants where the pests live 
another advantage is that biological pesticides like this one do 
not affect other insect species these are not broadbased 
poisons they are specific biological toxins carlson said 
the endophytes and their toxic protein are not passed on to 
future generations of the plant through its seeds carlson said 
and the corn produced by vaccinated plants has not been genetically 
altered itself so it need not pass rigorous safety tests required 
by the federal government of genetically engineered organisms 
carlson is now seeking approval for the vaccine from the 
environmental protection agency 
carlson said that field tests are continuing and the vaccinated 
corn could be on the market by 1993 or 1994 if the tests are 
successful and the government approves the vaccine

president bush said today that the continued 
standoff in the secessionist baltics republics certainly puts 
some tension on his upcoming summit with mikhail gorbachev but 
stressed his determination to press ahead with arms control 
negotiations 
the president said he was waiting to hear from secretary of 
state james a baker as to whether meetings underway in moscow 
might indicate progress in arms talks 
i would not predict that these matters cannot be resolved in 
time for the summit he said of several pending treaties 
bush opened a midday news conference with an urgent appeal 
to congress to approve his request for millions of dollars in 
economic aid to nicaragua and panama he called on congress to 
cancel a planned memorial day recess next week to act on the 
legislation 
asked about the remaining six american hostages in captivity in 
lebanon bush said i have seen no reason to be encouraged that 
the process is under way that would lead to their release two 
americans frank reed and robert polhill have been released in 
recent weeks 
the president also said he would announce a decision in days 
and not weeks on whether to approve a ban on offshore oil 
drilling off the coast of florida and california he cited 
nvironmental concerns but also noted he did not want the united 
states to become more dependent on foreign oil 
bush also told reporters he thought his administration and 
congressional leaders would be able to reach accord on a bipartisan 
program to cut a burgeoning deficit 
on other domestic issues bush said he was confident he could 
work out an agreement with members of congress on civil rights 
legislation the president has met with civil rights leaders and 
other in recent days 
he was less optimistic about legislation mandating companies to 
provide leave time for new parents ive got some problems with 
that one he said the white house has said previously bush would 
veto the measure that recently passed the house 
bush sounded none to confident about events in the soviet union 
where baker told reporters he hadnt seen much to be encouraged 
about in moscows response to the baltic drives for independence 
bush said the united states would like to see negotiations or 
dialogue discussion whatever you call it between the kremlin 
and the independentminded baltic republics of lithuania latvia 
and estonia 
calling on moscow to end the economic pressures imposed on 
lithuania bush said until something like that happens there 
will be tension between the united states and the soviet union 
but he indicated he was looking forward to his may 30june 3 
meetings with gorbachev saying pointedly we negotiated with the 
soviets when all eastern europe was in captivity

housing starts fell in april to their lowest 
level since the last recession in 1982 the government said 
wednesday 
interest rates remained high and the availability of 
construction money fell and analysts said the tight money 
situation was increasing housing costs and causing unemployment 
the lending spigot has been turned off said martin 
perlman president of the national association of home builders 
the result will be higher housing costs 
perlman said the home builders had dropped their 1990 forecast 
from 142 million starts to 128 million which would mean a loss 
of 200000 jobs in the housing industry 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
fell 58 percent in april to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
125 million units the smallest number since an annual rate of 
117 million units in the recession month of october 1982 
applications for building permits often a barometer of future 
housing activity were down 87 percent to an annual rate of 113 
million the lowest level since 105 million were sought in 
september 1982 
analysts attributed the situation to high interest rates and a 
credit crunch caused by the savings and loan bailout law and 
tighter lending policies by commercial banks 
that certainly must have given home builders a lot to think 
about before going out and starting new units said richard 
peach an economist with the mortgage bankers association 
mark obrinsky an economist with the federal national mortgage 
association said new home sales had been hurt by rising mortgage 
rates but he noted that mortgage rates usually follow the pattern 
of longterm bond rates which have been declining for several 
weeks 
so my best guess is well see some modest declines in mortgage 
rates over the remainder of the year he said 
john a tuccillo chief economist with the national association 
of realtors said the sampl bailout law was contributing to the 
credit crunch by reducing the amount of money that can be loaned to 
a single builder 
this factor coupled with the credit crunch being experienced 
across the country particularly in the northeast has had a biting 
effect on housing starts he said 
perlman said a survey of 6000 builders indicated that 60 
percent of those responding were cutting back plans for future 
housing laying off employees and in some cases just calling it 
quits 
after jumping 232 percent in january the warmest january on 
record housing starts have declined for three straight months 
58 percent in april 112 percent in march and 51 percent in 
february 
singlefamily starts in april fell 75 percent to an annual rate 
of 934000 units the lowest level since a 931000unit rate in 
december the fourth coldest december on record singlefamily 
starts had fallen 125 percent in march 
apartment construction was unchanged at 311000 units after 
falling 69 percent in march 
the only gain in starts was in the midwest where they were up 
38 percent to an annual rate of 298000 units 
starts in the south dropped 87 percent to an annual rate of 
480000 they were down 81 percent to 340000 units in the west 
and 8 percent to 127000 units in the northeast 
the building activity means the pace during the first four 
months of 1990 was 4 percent below that of the same period of 1989

a prosandinista strike virtually 
paralyzed public services in the capital today putting staggering 
pressures on the 3weekold government of violeta barrios de 
chamorro 
in another blow to the government and the crippled economy the 
bush administration said it could not provide a 40 million loan 
for legal reasons 
striking public employees spent their second day occupying 
government buildings but the capital was quiet this morning talks 
between the government and the strikers broke off around midnight 
a sandinista newspaper reported 
nicaraguan and us government officials accused the onceruling 
sandinista national liberation front of trying to undermine the 
conservative administration a charge no sandinista official has 
denied publicly so far 
sonia ortiz a labor leader said the strikers want a 200 
percent pay raise a subsidized food package rehiring of a labor 
leader fired monday and the demobilization of the contra rebels 
lady violeta has no idea what organized sandinista workers 
are she said 
the governing coalition uno which backed mrs chamorro en route 
to her feb 25 election victory issued a letter of support for 
her the 14party coalition recently had been suffering from 
factional disputes 
three weeks ago today mrs chamorro inherited an economy 
ravaged by 11 years of leftist sandinista mismanagement the contra 
insurgency and a us embargo that was lifted when she took office 
inflation is running about 70 percent a month 
in a cable to president bush mrs chamorro appealed for a quick 
40 million to curb the economic crisis that led to the strikes 
while congress considers a 300 million aid request 
my country is bankrupt she said in a cable dated may 11 
that was obtained tuesday 
but a white house official said today that it cannot provide the 
money because as a temporary loan the funds would have to be tied 
to some future expectation of revenue 
without assurances that lawmakers will approve the 300 million 
in aid the necessary guarantee was missing the official said on 
condition of anonymity bush instead planned to renew his plea for 
the aid package the official said 
striking airport workers closed the international airport 
schools banks and most communications were halted tuesday and 
only about 20 buses operated stranding thousands 
public hospitals were open but one said it would limit treatment 
to the very old or young pregnant women and emergency cases 
telephone telegraph and telex communications were dead cutting 
off most of nicaragua from the rest of the world communications 
workers allowed journalists to file stories but denied service to 
others 
outgoing phone service even to president chamorros offices was 
cut for several hours on tuesday 
government buildings in managua remained occupied but 
electricity and water supplies to the capital were not halted early 
today as threatened a day earlier by striking utility workers 
officially the goal is higher pay but mrs chamorro is looming 
as a major and growing target her government has declared the 
strikes illegal 
shouts of violeta start packing your bags the people own 
the government not the bourgeoisie and not one step back 
flew through muggy managua streets tuesday as workers occupied the 
buildings and police stood by or made halfhearted attempts to 
remove them 
at the ministries of agrarian reform and commerce and industry 
the police most of whom were hired by the sandinistas stood 
around joking with the strikers 
vice president virgilio godoy said on the radio the sandinistas 
are trying to overthrow president chamorro 
it is unfortunate that the sandinistas despite their promises 
to work with the chamorro government to achieve economic 
reconstruction and national reconciliation are engaging in what 
appear to be politically motivated strikes said us state 
department spokesman richard boucher in washington 
officially the strike is being coordinated by the union of 
national employees a relatively obscure but militantly 
prosandinista labor federation it has a lower profile than the 
betterknown sandinista workers central tied in the public eye to 
the sandinista organization 
most government workers are sandinistas left over from the 
previous government 
but dania salazar a communications worker said she opposed the 
strike because president chamorro had been in office just three 
weeks and we must let her try to do something first 
neither mrs chamorro nor sandinista former president daniel 
ortega made a public statement about the walkouts tuesday 
at the foreign ministry an angry mob rushed foreign minister 
enrique dreyfus and a group of managuas newly appointed 
ambassadors who took refuge in a nearby restaurant 
you have no business in nicaragua go back to miami the mob 
shouted at the diplomats inside the steak house 
many antisandinista nicaraguans lived in miami before mrs 
chamorro took office april 25 
this is a trial by force with the sandinistas said ernesto 
palazio appointed nicaraguan ambassador to washington who stood 
with his fellow diplomats before the mob rushed them 
mrs chamorro has promised to undo many of the leftist policies 
enacted by the sandinistas who insist on retaining control of the 
military and say their revolutionary reforms should not be touched

washington ap here is the text of president bushs news 
conference wednesday 
well today im making an urgent appeal to congress to come to 
the assistance of the peoples of nicaragua and panama i announced 
my original request for 500 500 million in assistance to panama 
on jan 25 and on march 13 i submitted my modified request for 
800 million for both nicaragua and panama 
at the time of submission i asked the congress for passage of 
the legislation by april 5 when that date passed i asked for 
passage in time for violetta chamorros inauguration on april 25 
i also asked members of congress in public and in private that 
the bill not be loaded up with extraneous items and members of our 
administration have met with the congress to explain the content 
and the urgency of this request 
but the easter recess came and went with no passage and 
moreover the bill has tripled in size as extraneous items have 
been piled onto it even worse the additional amendments include 
provisions that i vetoed as recently as last fall provisions that 
have absolutely nothing to do with nicaragua and panama and ive 
met repeatedly with the leadership of both houses of the congress 
to urge rapid passage

four groups representing most of the nations 
colleges and universities have urged defense secretary dick cheney 
to change the pentagons policy barring homosexuals from military 
service 
in a letter handdelivered tuesday and made available wednesday 
to the associated press the four higher education associations 
said the pentagon policy dated back to the days of official 
discrimination against blacks and other minority groups 
the letter focused on the policys impact on reserve officer 
training corps cadets several cadets in recent months have been 
denied commissions after telling superiors they were gay in most 
of those cases the military has sought repayment from the cadets 
of scholarships and other money 
the arguments for change in current rotc practices are 
several and seem to many of us compelling the four association 
presidents wrote 
the groups represented were the american council on education 
the association of american universities the american association 
of state colleges and universities and the national association of 
state universities and landgrant colleges together they 
represent virtually all of the colleges in the country 
the association heads asked for a meeting with cheney 
maj doug hart a defense department spokesman said wednesday 
that cheneys office had received the letter but he has not 
actually looked at it himself 
the association heads wrote sexual orientation appears to be 
the only basis on which discrimination is condoned within rotc or 
similar programs 
denial of equal opportunity on the grounds of race gender 
religion nationality or political affiliation among other 
possible criteria has long since been barred they said 
discrimination based on sexual orientation thus remains a curious 
anomaly 
the pentagon policy often runs counter to explicit prohibitions 
set by the schools against antigay discrimination in the case of 
the university of wisconsin the policy runs counter to state law 
the association heads noted 
the leaders warned that by continuing the policy the defense 
department would not only deprive itself of many qualified recruits 
who happen to be gay but would also drive away many who hold 
conventional sexual views but find discrimination unacceptable in 
any form 
hart took issue with the point in the letter suggesting that 
denial of equal opportunity based on political affiliation has 
been barred in the past 
i dont think if a person said they were a member of the 
communist party theyd have much luck getting an rotc 
scholarship he said 
the involvement of the education groups stemmed from incidents 
on various campuses involving protests against the rotc policy or 
actual cases in which gay cadets were denied commissions and told 
to repay their tuition scholarships

secretary of state james a baker iii said today 
the soviet response to pleas that they open negotiations with 
baltic republics pushing for independence is not encouraging 
baker starting four days of talks with foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze said he would press soviet officials to explain 
why they have not negotiated with leaders of the restive baltic 
states 
that dialogue has not yet developed baker said before going 
into talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak who also is 
visiting moscow its not encouraging to us to see the absence of 
a dialogue between leaders there and the kremlin 
in washington president bush told a news conference he was 
concerned that the baltics problem could inflect damage on the 
wider sovietamerican relationship 
it certainly has put some tension in the summit meeting he 
is to open with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in washington 
on may 30 bush said but he said the issue is not a reason to end 
or slow down discussion on arms control and other issues 
bush said it was too early to tell whether remaining obstacles 
to a treaty cutting longrange nuclear weapons could be overcome in 
time for the washington summit 
i wouldnt say it appears unlikely that at least the main 
elements of an agreement could be in place by then he said 
after meeting with mubarak baker met with jewish refuseniks 
who have been denied soviet exit permits he then sat down with 
shevardnadze to prepare for the ussoviet summit in washington 
later this month 
baker who also will meet friday with gorbachev hoped to revive 
stalemated armscontrol talks as well as discuss the unrest in the 
baltics 
shevardnadze told reporters before his session with baker at the 
soviet foreign ministry the fact we are able to discuss any 
problem shows we have reached a new frontier 
he also pledged to try to speed arms control agreements that 
were to serve as a centerpiece for the summit we have been 
working very intensively shevardnadze said 
asked if the soviets had retreated as some us officials 
insist shevardnadze replied through an interpreter i dont 
think so this is the view of those who really dont know whats 
happening 
baker meanwhile said the effort now to bridge differences is 
very important when you consider we have only two weeks to go 
leaders in the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia 
have been attempting to open talks with gorbachev over independence 
efforts but the soviet leader has balked 
a proindependence newspaper the estonian independent reported 
that estonian prime minister edgar savisaar told baker in a 
telegram that the estonian government would be deeply surprised 
were the incidents in estonia and latvia not to find 
reverberation in his talks with shevardnadze 
tension between moscow and the three breakaway republics casts 
an shadow over the summit which is due to begin may 30 there are 
also deep differences between us and soviet negotiators over 
missile reductions 
its our desire and i hope its the desire of the soviets 
they say it is that we can close the gap on all of the major 
substantive issues by the time the two presidents get together in 
washington baker told reporters 
but he stressed that we still have a pretty good road to 
travel there are still a number of issues between us 
baker was asked about the baltics when he arrived at the 
egyptian embassy to see mubarak about prospects for negotiations 
between israel and palestinian arabs 
mubarak gave a downbeat assessment of the situation in the 
middle east 
he said there had been nothing positive from the direction 
of prime minister yitzhak shamir since the israeli leader last 
month declined to endorse bakers framework for talks with 
palestinians in cairo 
administration officials accompanying baker said he had no plans 
to present mubarak who was here to confer with soviet officials 
with a new approach to getting peace talks going between israel and 
palestinians 
the secretary of state went from his meeting with mubarak to a 
session with 15 jewish refuseniks who have been denied soviet 
exit permits 
the refuseniks are jews who have long awaited permission to 
emigrate baker said there are 79 unresolved cases of applicants 
that have us support 
were very anxious that they be given permission to 
emigrate he told reporters 
two us officials who traveled to moscow with baker told 
reporters the soviets had backtracked on certain potential arms 
reduction measures in talks in washington last month after having 
made considerable headway in february in moscow 
there has been some movement to try to pick up the pieces 
one of the officials said of ongoing talks in geneva but he 
declined to venture a prediction of baker success or to describe 
recent headway as substantial 
it would be very disturbing if they were not prepared to get 
back to where we were said the official who like his colleague 
spoke only on condition of not being identified by name 
baker aides said on the flight from washington to moscow that 
key issues remain unresolved 
the differences are over restrictions to be placed on cruise 
missiles carried aboard planes and warships on mobile missiles 
with multiple warheads and on heavy landbased missiles 
in addition the two sides have not yet agreed to a method of 
verifying compliance with reductions in strategic nuclear weapons 
other issues include completion of an accord on ending the 
production of chemical weapons and reducing troop and tank strength 
in europe

president bush said today he wont attempt to 
rally public support for slashing the deficit until a bipartisan 
compromise is framed saying it could send the wrong signals to 
financial markets 
bush also told a news conference that he wont be bullied by 
democrats into showing his hand first in proposing a package of 
spending cuts and possible tax increases 
lets not talk about whos going first weve got a problem a 
national problem bush said 
his comments came as congressional democrats criticized him for 
refusing to go directly to the public with the economic bad news 
that prompted him to call a summit on the budget deficit 
i dont want to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the 
markets bush said 
im not going to go out there with a lot of suggestions to 
part of the problem he added 
he said that some democrats he met with on tuesday at the 
kickoff session of his domestic budget summit had suggested that he 
go first 
i said wait a minute bush said adding that he had 
reminded lawmakers that taxes and spending originate in congress 
bush the day before had spurned the request of some democrats 
that he go on primetime television to discuss the seriousness of 
the widening budget gap 
at the appropriate time i will said bush asked when that 
would be bush said i dont know weve got to get on with what 
i told you the process is and the process is not setting 
preconditions 
asked if the current budget situation was a test of his 
leadership on a major domestic problem bush said i expect so 
as he has before bush completely sidestepped the issue of new 
taxes saying that he did not want to comment on any issues that 
might be up for negotiation 
asked if a tax existed that would not be a drag on the economy 
bush declared youre trying to get me to do that which just one 
second ago i wouldnt do 
but on the prospect of reaching a budget compromise that can 
win the support of the administration and a majority of both house 
and senate the president said after some initial posturing 
around well make some headway 
bush said that he hopes to see interest rates fall but had no 
guarantee from the federal reserve that the central bank would act 
to force rates down 
the administration has cited rising interest rates along with 
lowerthanexpected revenues and a higherthan expected pricetag on 
the savings and loan bailout as the reason for the widening deficit 
gap 
earlier today democrats criticized bush for not presenting his 
own remedies for trimming the deficit 
if were in such bad straits the american people ought to 
hear it and lets get on with fixing the crisis said rep 
barbara boxer dcalif a member of the house budget committee 
at the first session of the budget summit on tuesday a 
closeddoor session the presidents budget director said the 
deficit could near 200 billion next year unless action is taken 
the budget talks began two weeks after congress began moving 
toward approval of 12 trillion spending plans written by 
democrats those measures slash bushs proposed pentagon budget 
but lack the deficit reduction the white house now says is needed 
bargainers said that while tuesdays session went well no 
specific approaches for attacking the shortfall were discussed 
including possible tax increases or spending cuts 
everything was generalities said rep silvio conte of 
massachusetts ranking republican on the house appropriations 
committee 
participants said the 100minute meeting focused on the growing 
size of the budget gap and the urgency of tackling the problem 
one negotiator senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn said he believes bush wants democrats to first reveal 
their own deficitreduction ideas 
sasser also said that at tuesdays session white house budget 
chief richard darman offered new figures further swelling the 
expected size of the budget gap for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 
1 
according to sasser darman said next years deficit would range 
between 140 billion and 188 billion if the costs of rescuing the 
savings and loan industry are included the shortfall would be 
about 138 billion if those expenses are not counted 
the new figures mean it would take 72 billion to 124 billion 
in some combination of higher taxes and spending cuts to stay 
within the grammrudman deficit limit of 64 billion for next year 
one possible outcome of the talks however is an agreement to 
raise next years deficit target thus requiring fewer cuts or new 
taxes darman has said he believes a good goal for the negotiators 
is agreement on a 50 billion deficit reduction package

in the last several days ive shared with them the contents of 
this letter that i received from president chamorro of nicaragua 
pleading for prompt passage 
the situation in nicaragua is critical mrs chamorros 
government is absolutely bankrupt and there are strikes and 
demonstrations in the streets 
shes asked me for an emergency bridge loan but i cant provide 
that because the nicaraguans have no assured means of repayment 
and our hands are tied and i cant provide a loan anchored on 
legislation which is not assured panama is also in dire need of 
the jumpstart that our assistance will give to enable it to 
recover from the economic devastation of the noriega dictatorship 
were now facing the memorial day recess without the assurance 
that this legislation will be passed i would like the legislation 
this week certainly early next week but i will call on the 
congress to remain in session until it completes action on a bill 
that i can sign 
we must not let this procedural gridlock in the congress destroy 
the hopes for freedom in these two fledgling democracies i feel 
very strongly about it and i will again appeal to congress to get 
moving on this bill 
q mr president officials accompanying secretary of state 
baker to moscow say the soviets have backtracked on earlier 
agreements on arms control does it appear unlikely that youll 
have the outlines of a start treaty to sign at the summit and how 
much of a setback would that be 
a terry i dont i wouldnt say that it appears unlikely 
i have not heard from jim baker since the talks have started in 
moscow i expect well be hearing pretty soon but i would not 
predict that these matters cannot be resolved in time for the 
summit but if theyre not were going to keep on because we want 
a start agreement and im convinced the soviets want a start 
agreement 
q how much of a cloud has been put over the summit by the 
tension the soviet pressure on the baltic states 
a well ill be able to answer that a little more after jim 
comes back from moscow but id say that it is certainly puts 
some tension on the summit we want to see negotiations or dialogue 
or whatever you call it discussions between gorbachev and the 
lithuanians get going and then id like to see the release of that 
economic pressure on lithuania and that would clear the air fast 
but until something like that happens there will be tension 
but we have a broad agenda of items that we must go forward on 
and we have negotiated with the soviets when all of eastern europe 
was in captivity and when we had cold war times and i im 
unhappy about the state of play in the baltics because id like to 
see them obtain their desire of freedom as soon as possible 
but i feel that its important from our standpoint the 
important standpoint of eastern european countries and western 
european allies and indeed the whole world that we have these 
discussions with mr gorbachev and i look forward to them very 
much and i particularly look forward to the private ones where i 
can get a better feel for the problems facing him and i can tell 
him of our priorities in a very frank setting 
helen 
q mr president will you sign the panamanicaraguan aid bill 
if it contains funding for abortion will you sign the parental 
leave bill and will you sign the civil rights act 
a on the on the i will not accept the nicaraguapanama bill 
with that mischievous language placed on it it has nothing to do 
with nicaragua and panama and it ought to be taken out but if they 
dont if it comes to me that way it will go right back up and 
well still urge the congress to do what they ought to do to help 
these democracies 
what were the other two 
q the civil rights act and parental leave you have a have 
you removed a veto threat on civil rights and the threat remains on 
parental leave 
a civil rights were working hard to get agreement weve had 
a series of meetings ive participated in two of them weve had 
three at the white house with leadership groups our staff is 
working with congress and i hope we can narrow the differences 
enough so that we can go forward together on this legislation 
and parental leave ive got some real problems with that one 
but i just have to have to wait til i get recommendations on it

in a major reform the 
government wednesda johannesburgy declared public hospitals open to 
all races 
reversing its decadesold policy of segregated health services 
health minister rina venter told parliament in cape town that 
all hospitals must be available to all south africans for the 
countrys health system to run effectively

lawrence harrington says he has not eaten british 
beef for 12 weeks and that the hamburger meat in his butcher shop 
is irish 
he too is caught up in the panic that has spread across britain 
over socalled mad cow disease 
britains chief medical officer tried to calm consumers with a 
statement that beef can be eaten safely by everyone both adults 
and children 
but more than 1000 schools have dropped british beef from their 
cafeteria menus 
a parliamentary committee wednesday announced an urgent inquiry 
into the mysterious disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 
bse which affects a cows brain and central nervous system 
what we hope to do is either allay fears or if there is a 
problem force the government to do things that will then calm the 
fears of the public said martyn jones a microbiologist and 
labor party member of the house of commons agriculture committee 
the government said there is no known case of bse affecting a 
human but the fears intensified last week when the government 
reported that a siamese cat had died from a suspected feline 
version of bse 
ive been in this business for 17 years and ive never seen 
beef sales drop off like this said harrington leaning against 
the counter of his shop bruton meat across the road at 
smithfields meat market crews hosed meat and blood off the street 
in preparation for the refrigerated trucks that rumble nightly into 
londons wholesale meat market 
cattle suffering the disease foam at the mouth and are unable to 
stand or walk normally 
the precise cause of the disease is unknown but experts believe 
the cattle contracted it by eating highprotein feed containing the 
remains of sheep infected with a strain of bse 
since 1986 when bse was first identified 13000 head of cattle 
have been slaughtered the national farmers union said 
harrington said the government should act forcefully to calm 
people 
all the herds where theyve found one diseased cow should be 
destroyed so they can put peoples minds to rest he said 
barry simmons a butcher for 35 years also criticized the 
government 
the governments not clarifying it said simmons at his 
central london shop its become political the government 
doesnt want to lose the farmers vote whats upsetting the public 
the most is not actually knowing 
prime minister margaret thatchers office said british beef was 
the main dish at lunch wednesday with greek prime minister 
constantine mitsotakis 
agriculture minister john gummer ate a hamburger for the cameras 
and declared i can say perfectly honestly that i shall go on 
eating beef and my children will go on eating beef because there is 
no danger 
simmons said he had not noticed a substantial drop in british 
beef sales 
he surmised that having endured major scares about contaminated 
water salmonella in eggs and listeria in chickens people are fed 
up with worrying 
people just say sod it if the beef dont kill you the chicken 
or the water will he said 
richard guy said the scare boosted sales for his real meat 
company which sells grassfed beef 
were all more likely to be run over on our way back home 
tonight than we are to get bse he told bbctv but i do feel a 
disease that can knock a halfton animal out and render it a sort 
of gibbering idiot must be looked into fairly urgently 
because of bse the us department of agricultures animal and 
plant health inspection service banned imports of cattle embryos 
and bull semen from great britain in july 1989 similar bans have 
been imposed by the soviet union australia israel and britains 
european community partners

exclusivism 
however a southern baptist church historian the rev g thomas 
halbrooks said at a later session that despite impressions to the 
contrary the historic baptist stance favored relationships 
with other churches 
others have often perceived southern baptists as being 
isolated sectarians who consider themselves as having no need for 
relationships with anyone else he said 
some actions have upheld that negative perspective said 
halbrooks president of the denominations historical society and a 
professor at southeastern baptist theological seminary in wake 
forest nc 
he said the 15 millionmember denomination has varied roots 
some of them such as the colonial root and eastern root 
supporting cooperation with other denominations on the other hand 
he said a frontier root and western root stressed 
exclusivity as the only true church and joined with the 
provincial southern root in becoming dominant 
southern baptists may look to their eastern and colonial roots 
and there find guideposts that can point the way out of the 
darkness of their provincialism into the brightness of the broader 
community of the christian faith he said 
in the earlier comments from other denominations reported by 
baptist press dalton who for aroman catholic 
observer at southern baptist conventions said he admires their 
zeal and music 
but he said the infighting and preoccupation with church 
membership threaten to obscure larger social issues while a lack 
of ritual and emphasis on show rather than substance may 
undercut genuine worship 
dalton of cincinnati an educator and vice president of glenmary 
home missioners who work extensively in the south said what i 
see in mr or mrs average baptist sometimes saddens me i see a 
conversion experience in danger of becoming only a ritual of 
walking the aisle 
in the south catholics tend to view you defensively with 
prejudice and with a certain amount of disdain touched with an 
envy of your buildings and your power he said 
in may ways southern baptists epitomize the american ethos 
he said your danger is that you will fall into cultural 
captivity and lose your prophetic edge of biblical strength 
peck manager of periodicals at the united methodist publishing 
house in nashville said mainline denominations view southern 
baptists as dominated by politics and polemics in controlling 
their institutions 
he said southern baptists tend to be more loyal to their 
denomination than others but he said the church is impoverished if 
only people who agree that scripture is without error are allowed 
positions of leadership 
mainliners might envy your denomination for its evangelical 
fervor its compassion for others around the globe its fine 
publications its healthy budgets and large membership but they 
would not trade all these together for freedom of thought he 
said 
he said southern baptists seem more conservative more 
friendly and hospitable and yet less tolerant of the views of those 
who differ with them

yeah 
q mr president the democratic leaders who came out of 
yesterdays first round of the budget talks indicated that before 
theyre going to advance any proposals at all for dealing with the 
problem they want to hear first the administrations discussion of 
how grave the problem is and then an administration proposal or 
set of proposals for dealing with it does the administration have 
ready a set of budget proposals that would address the deficit 
fully at this time 
a not fully but dick darman has already begun discussions 
after yesterdays meeting with congressman gephardt and i think 
that the negotiation can go forward so that both sides come to the 
table say what they think and we get an agreement im confident 
we can get one but this mandating who does what first thats not 
going to get the job done 
so were going to go up there no preconditions and have a 
good discussion and i think after theres some initial posturing 
around were going to make some headway we have to make some 
headway 
in terms of the magnitude of problem i do feel that we have an 
obligation to be sure the congressmen understand it but brit in 
this sense of going out right now to the american people i want to 
go out when we have a bipartisan answer to the problem say 
heres what the problem is and heres what the answer and if i 
go out there today we dont have a bipartisan answer and thats 
the only way this problems going to be solved its not going to 
be done one party or another and it is urgent enough and when the 
congress sees the data and the estimates and then cbo and omb work 
with the estimates im convinced that well have enough of a sense 
of urgency that well go forward and get a deal 
q well mr president surely you must recognize that part of 
the reason why theyre so wary is that they heard what they thought 
were conflicting signals from the administration last week you 
saying no preconditions gov sununu suggesting something 
quite otherwise first of all what 
happened there and second what did you say to him about that 
a well i havent said anything to him about it but ive heard 
conflicting signals out of congress from the first day i said no 
conditions people trying to interpret what that meant and a wide 
array of blasts out of congress on both sides of the aisle 
but it doesnt help for me to do anything other than to cool it 
down and say look weve got a big problem heres the problem 
let me explain it to you all as best omb can you tell us how cbo 
sees it then lets as lyndon said reason together and try to 
get a deal and then make sure the american people understand how 
serious it is 
but brit im not going to go out there and try to and do 
something that might inadvertently suggest crisis and and and 
frighten markets what i think we ought to do is come up get 
agreement on the size of the problem and then have a bipartisan 
answer and this is very sensitive stuff 
right now the markets are reasonably reasonably optimistic 
and there is there are reasons to be optimistic about the 
economy ive seen that earlier on there were some predictions of 
recession but right now it appears that most economists dont 
think there will be a recession so we are blessed by dealing with 
this problem at a time of some growth not the robust growth that 
some of us would like to see but with some growth and yet 
theres still some concerns on the part of the fed and others on 
inflation so i dont want to inadvertently send the wrong signals 
to the markets 
yes charles 
q mr president mr darman has already indicated that there is 
little probability of getting all the cuts that are necessary and 
the problem is estimated at 100 billion what is your 
predisposition towards stretching out or amending grammrudman so 
that you can do this at a unintelligible pace 
a charles i hate to its a very good question very direct 
and im not going to answer it because i am not going to go out 
there with a lot of suggestions to part of the problem and ive 
said that ive agreed with the congress i think theyre not 
supposed to do that either 
so we will conduct our discussions in private and then we will 
have recommendations that might be part of it because this the 
problem is pretty big but i dont have a position on that and i 
because ive said there are no preconditions 
yes 
q well sir actually your spokesman mr fitzwater has 
listed some conditions he says you wouldnt 
a down with him down hes laughter 
q you wouldnt do anything on the budget deficit and you 
wouldnt advocate any solutions that would be a drag on the 
economy my question to you is can you be persuaded that a tax 
exists that would not be a drag on the economy do you know of any 
such tax 
a john youre trying to get me to do that which just one 
second ago i said i wouldnt do and i am trying to negotiate and 
to keep the negotiating process in good faith but i just cant 
if i start going into answering questions like that no matter how 
much merit they have then i start having conditions or 
preconditions and i cant do that and deal in good faith with the 
congress 
q can i ask you your concept 
a yes 
q of leadership on this 
a yes 
q you will n in the period 
19471987 health care spending grew 25 percent faster per year 
than other spending and that it now consumes more than 11 percent 
of the gross national product 
that percentage compares with just 5 percent of gnp in 1947 it 
comes at the expense of other areas of the economy at the expense 
of housing and education for example it robs funds from 
environmental improvement 
if trends continue says fuchs a stanford university health 
economist the percentage will reach 20 in a few decades right 
now he says there is little prospect to substantially alter 
this trend 
the problem has myriad causes judging from the vast number 
typically named by specialists in the field among them 
high labor costs without increases in productivity poor 
hospital management technological innovation aging population 
poor health habits thirdparty payments that remove patient 
incentives to save 
fuchs who is also a researcher at the national bureau of 
economic research in cambridge mass observes that health care 
wages have risen more rapidly than those of other workers while 
productivity gains have been slower 
his figures show that net incomes of physicians rose about 8 
percent a year in 19771987 while the wages of private 
nonagricultural workers rose about 55 percent a year 
many businesses are attacking the rising cost to them by 
requiring workers to fund more of the bill for health insurance 
a survey of 1900 companies by a foster higgins amp co a 
benefits consultant showed 45 percent require contributions for 
individual coverage vs 39 percent in 1988 
the same survey showed that individual deductibles once 
commonly placed at 100 are now often at 300 and that 72 percent 
of employers require employees to pay some portion of hospital 
charges compared with 66 percent in 1988 
some smaller companies are putting their workers on the payrolls 
of employee leasing companies whose large number of workers allow 
them to obtain lower health insurance rates and lower costs for 
other benefits as well 
barry kerr director of employee leasing of new york inc 
claims that our typical client reduces his medical insurances 
costs anywere from 20 percent to 35 percent when we take over the 
payroll 
larger companies and insurers too also are becoming more aware 
of the need to emphasize preventive medicine to teach better 
health habits to convince employees to change destructive 
lifestyles 
a health and fitness survey of 2000 employees at steelcase 
inc a michigan manufacturing company found that just 10 percent 
of the employees accounted for 66 percent of the companys health 
care costs 
the study conducted by the university of michigan fitness 
research center found that many of the workers health problems 
involved smoking alcohol drugs highfat diets lack of exercise 
and uncontrolled high blood pressure 
more than half of all chronic diseases including cancer and 
heart disease said the centers director prof dw edington are 
related to lifestyle it is a rare company nevertheless that 
offers incentives to better lifestyles 
without some fundamental change it is obvious that health care 
costs will eat like a cancer into other areas of the economy 
devouring funds once aimed at improving environment child care 
housing education and social issues 
the michigan findings provoked prof dw edington the centers 
director to make this comment 
we are swiftly moving into an era of increasing conflict 
between two prized american values access to health care and the 
freedom to choose how we live something has to give

a senate committee approved a 
110millionayear antismoking bill wednesday that would 
encourage states to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes 
to minors 
the bill approved 104 by the labor and human resources 
committee also would finance improvement of programs designed to 
educate americans about dangers of smoking the government would be 
authorized to buy advertisements encouraging nonsmokers to avoid 
the habit and smokers to stop 
the bill will be a major step forward in our ongoing 
battle to inform the public and reduce the high toll of death and 
disability that smoking inflicts on our society said sen edward 
m kennedy dmass chairman of the committee 
the bush administration last february called the legislation 
unnecessary the tobacco industry which has been negotiating with 
the committee staff to change some provisions opposes the bill 
as senator kennedy acknowledged today a good deal of progress 
was made during those discussions said walker merryman a 
spokesman for the tobacco institute he added however it is 
clear that the previous weeks of discussions are not reflected in 
this committee action 
before the vote the committee stripped away several points of 
contention including one provision that would have required a 
label describing smoking as addictive 
kennedy said efforts to restore those provisions may be made 
when the full senate considers the bill most of the provisions 
fall under the jurisdiction of the senate commerce committee 
rather than kennedys panel 
kennedy noted 44 states restrict the sale of tobacco to minors 
but said few states or communities enforce those laws 
retail establishments throughout the nation require proof of 
age for the purchase of alcoholic beverages but this step is 
rarely required for tobacco products he said this bill will 
encourage states to bring their retailers into compliance with 
state laws 
the bill would set up grants to reward states for better 
enforcement of laws that prohibit sale of tobacco to minors 
other parts of the legislation would 
establish a center for tobacco products in the centers for 
disease control the center would expand federal antismoking 
education and research such questions as why people smoke and why 
some stop 
set up a pilot program offering grants to help reduce workplace 
smoking among groups such as bluecollar workers with a high 
incidence of tobacco use 
provide grants to states for distribution to elementary and 
secondary schools to help create a smokefree environment 
set up a national program to provide information on how tobacco 
use affects health this would include money for creating 
publicservice announcements and paid commercials targeted on those 
with the highest risks 
require public disclosure of tobacco additives and how they 
could affect health

q is this the biggest test of your leadership on a domestic 
problem 
a i expect so 
q mr president you are facing a deadline on a decision of 
granting most favored nation status to china 
a yes 
q can you tell us first of all if youve made the call 
secondly if you havent what pressures do you face in terms of 
once again rewarding china in the absence of significant 
concessions or changes on their off mike 
a i have not made a decision on it we are its a that 
issue is under under i would say lively discussion i have seen 
significant editorial comment that urges strongly against cutting 
off mfn that comment coming from people that were quite critical 
of me in the way i handled the student matter in other words they 
would have preferred to see the pelosi legislation as opposed to 
the executive action that i took 
theres another dimension that you asked how what the 
thought process is here that relates to hong kong that is quite 
important in terms of trade a significant importance 
some of the people that opposed my earlier approach are urging 
that mfn continue and so it isnt an easy call because i dont 
want to send a signal that we are happy with the human rights 
record we have considerable i still am of the mind that having 
contact and working in an area where there has been progress on the 
economic side with china is important so these are some of the 
ingredients were considering right now but it isnt it isnt 
that clear a call for me yet 
q well do you think that you might not grant most favored 
nation status as a way to signal them of the disappointment that 
youve admitted to because they havent changed that much after 
tiananmen square 
a well ive i i am not suggesting thats what i plan to do 
yeah maureen 
q mr president a lot of republicans especially republican 
women congresswomen are wondering how you could threaten to veto 
a bill that would guarantee job security to pregnant women and 
other people with family emergencies especially since every other 
industrialized nation except south africa has such a bill 
a i think it boils down to the concept of whether you are in 
favor of mandated benefits or not and one of the complaints i get 
from our close proximity to the governors and working with the 
governors is please dont mandate more benefits from the central 
government 
so weve had a difference ive been quite open with my 
concerns about that and yet i have great respect for the 
republican women and others that you mentioned that differ with me 
on that one 
yeah 
q mr president a few weeks ago when the two hostages were 
released you said you hoped that it was the beginning of a 
process has anything happened since then thats encouraged you 
that a process is underway 
a no 
q i mean is it that blunt i mean is it worse than that does 
it look like nothing has happened at all 
a i answered it as best i can i see no reason to be encouraged 
that the process is under way but i think i said right in this 
room there were certain things we could do and were trying to 
follow up things we can do without violating some fundamental 
principles on negotiating or trading hostages for something and 
were going forward there 
i remember i mentioned the account of trying to account for 
four iranians that were taken and whom i our government feels are 
dead but the iranians are very most interested in having an 
accounting for that and thats something i feel that we can move 
forward on so were trying to get more information although they 
didnt suggest and i can confirm that we had nothing to do with the 
taking of those people but its a human its a matter of human 
concern to their families and all so heres an area where we might 
be able to facilitate matters there

many people who test negative for the aids 
virus may actually be infected according to a study published 
wednesday 
dr tab ansari of emory university in atlanta said his 
laboratory tested the blood of 165 people who had tested negative 
for the aids virus and found that 30 were in fact infected 
he said in an interview that the study raises the possibility 
that there are people who are chronically infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes aids but who never get sick 
or develop easily found antibodies 
in a study published in the proceedings of the national academy 
of science ansari said his team used a new type of test to find 
hiv antibodies that had escaped detection by routine hospital 
laboratory blood tests 
all of the ones that they found positive we found positive 
ansari said but in addition there were quite a few that were 
negative in their assay that were picked up as positive 
ansari said the experiment began with 165 blood samples tested 
using elisa or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay the aids test 
most commonly used in hospitals and clinics the samples then were 
additionally tested using the western blot assay a test routinely 
used to confirm the elisa finding 
all of the samples tested in that traditional way were found 
negative for the hiv virus according to the study 
meanwhile unlabeled blood from the same samples along with 
blood specimens from healthy volunteers were provided to ansari 
and his team his team did not know which samples came from a 
highrisk population mostly drug users and which came from 
healthy volunteers 
the specimens were subjected to a test called the pokeweed 
mitogen assay a procedure that forces specialized cells in the 
blood to expel antibodies into the blood serum the serum then was 
tested using the elisa and western blot assays 
thirty of the samples or 18 percent were found to contain 
antibodies to the hiv virus an indication of infection each of 
those 30 samples were previously found by the two standard tests to 
be free of virus antibodies 
ansari said the routine tests would give positive results only 
if hiv antibodies are in the blood serum the pokeweed mitogen 
assay he said shows that there may be infected people who dont 
develop serum antibodies to the aids virus 
for some reason there are blood cells that have the antibody 
but do not secrete it ansari said adding that the elisa and 
western blot tests would not be able to detect the antibodies 
the study similar findings by other researchers and studies of 
viral infections in monkeys suggest that some people may contract 
the hiv infection but never progress to the actual aids disese he 
said 
we need to follow up these people and study their immunity and 
then perhaps we could understand how that happens he said 
ansari however emphasized that the possible existence of 
hidden chronic hiv infections that never progess to disease is 
only speculation 
a national institutes of health researcher who asked not to be 
named said ansaris study confirms the suggestions of other 
researchers that people can be latently infected and not test 
positive for the virus 
the emory study ansari said should not be interpreted to mean 
that blood donated for transfusion which is tested with the elisa 
assay is unsafe 
he said all of the blood that tested positive in his study came 
from people at very high risk for hiv and that those people 
would be excluded through an interview process from donating blood

radical russian lawmakers began a fight wednesday 
to win more power for the soviet unions largest republic and said 
they want to elect communist maverick boris yeltsin as their 
republics president 
either russia will be a supporting part of the soviet empire 
or the russian federation will be independent in economic 
political and cultural fields lawmaker oleg rumyanstev said at 
the opening of the russian republics congress 
the russian reformers seek greater control over their republics 
economic and political affairs which are now almost entirely 
controlled by the national bureaucracy 
either its allowed to be free or someone from moscow will 
dictate everything said rumyanstev a leader of the newly formed 
social democratic party he spoke during a break in the opening 
session which was devoted largely to procedural matters 
the official soviet news agency tass said some russian lawmakers 
are demanding independence like the three baltic republics and 
groups in azerbaijan georgia and the ukraine 
russian news media regularly discuss sovereignty which they say 
would give the republics greater rights as members of a less 
centrally controlled soviet union 
the russian republic is the heart of the soviet union it 
includes moscow 52 percent of the nations population and 
threequarters of its land from the baltic sea to the pacific 
ocean russian is the soviet unions dominant language 
russia is by far the largest of the 15 soviet republics it 
embraces 11 time zones and the vast oil gas mineral and gold 
reserves of siberia many russians feel their wealth supports the 
other republics 
in the race for the new post of president of russia a yeltsin 
victory could mean a loss of face for soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev because yeltsin is his most popular rival yeltsin has 
advanced his career by criticizing gorbachev and the privileges of 
the party elite 
gorbachev has thrown his support in the race to current russian 
premier alexander vlasov 
gorbachev emphasized the importance of this battle by spending 
all day wednesday silently observing the opening sessions debate 
in the grand kremlin palace legislators said organizational 
matters could easily postpone the presidential election until 
friday 
if yeltsin and the radicals win control of the russian congress 
they plan to seek changes in the russian constitution that would 
clash with the national charter some would follow the baltic 
example in demanding that laws of the russian republic take 
priority over national ones 
russia has no rights it follows the lead of the center it 
has no policies of its own foreign or domestic yeltsin said at 
a rally monday its time the central government stopped biting 
pieces off russia fifty percent of its population lives at or 
below the poverty level 
political allegiances in the congress of the russian federation 
probably will remain unclear until the lawmakers elect their 
chairman popularly known as the president of the republic 
yeltsin has estimated that he and vlasov each would win 30 
percent of the votes the rest are up for grabs he said 
other possible contenders are lesserknown figures yuri 
manayenkov a communist party secretary ivan polozkov a hardline 
opponent of free enterprise and arkady volksy who for more than a 
year headed the communist party committee that ran the ethnically 
torn nagornokarabakh enclave in the caucasus mountains 
yeltsin 58 was ousted from his job as moscow communist party 
chief and his slot in the party politburo two years ago after 
criticizing gorbachev and party privileges but he made a comeback 
by winning 89 percent of the popular vote to represent moscow in 
the national parliament 
both yeltsin and vlasov have taken up the issue of russian 
sovereignty in their platforms 
vlasov told soviet television that the republic not the 
national government should control its natural resources he also 
said all forms of ownership should be encouraged in agriculture an 
implied endorsement of private land ownership still forbidden by 
soviet law

a human rights report published thursday said 
159 arab children were killed and as many as 63000 wounded by 
bullets beatings and tear gas during the first two years of the 
palestinian uprising 
the study sponsored by the swedish save the children group 
claimed israels army practiced calculated cruelty in some 
cases and it urged international protection of palestinian 
children 
the findings were rejected by the office of brig gen nachman 
shai the army spokesman and criticized by israeli human rights 
activists as onesided 
maj moshe fogel an army spokesman said proplo activists used 
children as shields during protests and were responsible for their 
injuries 
we are faced with an uprising which turns its children into 
martyrs and actually encourages minors to participate in violent 
activities against israeli soldiers whether actively or 
passively he said 
thomas hammarberg head of the swedish group and a former 
secretarygeneral of amnesty international said israeli leaders 
failed to investigate abuses adequately and gave soldiers the 
impression they could do as they liked 
it could be the soldiers believe plastic and rubbercoated 
bullets are nonlethal he said in an interview but i think it 
begins to take the form of the intentional if they let it continue 
when they know the consequences 
the report said 159 children aged 16 and under were killed in 
the first two years of the uprising against israeli rule of the 
occupied lands the uprising began in december 1987 the report 
said 106 of the 159 children were shot to death so far this year 
13 children have been shot to death the report said 
the army says 79 children under the age of 14 were fatally 
wounded in the last 29 months it does not have a figure for 
victims 16 and under 
the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied 
territories says 148 children 16 and under had died through may 1 
spokeswoman zahava galon said tear gas deaths were excluded as too 
difficult to substantiate and that no reliable injury estimates 
were available 
the army disputed the reports claim that the vast majority 
of soldiers were not punished for wrongdoing fogel said soldiers 
were courtmartialed or disciplined for improper use of force in 25 
percent of the fatality cases of children recorded by the army 
he said army investigations were hampered because palestinians 
often take bodies before autopsies can be performed and arab 
witnesses refuse to cooperate with army investigators 
the threevolume 1008paged study was written by anne elizabeth 
nixon former deputy director of the american save the children 
program in israel it was funded by a ford foundation grant 
the report examined how children 16 and under suffered physical 
injuries and the effects of collective punishments such as school 
closures curfews house demolitions raids and economic sanctions 
it concluded in view of the palestinian communitys 
difficulty in protecting its children and the inadequacy of 
safeguards dependent upon israeli government enforcement 
protection of palestinian childrenbecomes an urgent matter in 
need of immediate consideration by the international community 
joshua schoffman an israeli civil rights lawyer said the study 
had serious flaws because it relied too heavily on palestinian 
sources 
just as one has to treat army announcements with skepticism 
you have to treat palestinian testimony with skepticism and balance 
the two he said 
among the findings 
52 percent of the children killed were not in the vicinity of a 
protest when they were fatally injured 
children accounted for 21 percent of all deaths and 38 percent 
of all injuries and deaths combined by ap count 687 palestinians 
have been killed along with 43 israelis 
the average age of children killed was 10 years 
about one in every 15 to 20 children in the occupied lands was 
injured totalling 50000 to 63000

senegalese president abdou diouf said 
wednesday the united states could hasten an end to dictatorships in 
africa by withholding aid to countries which do not tolerate 
opposition parties 
this might be a way to assist a quicker coming of democracy to 
our continent diouf told a gathering at the center for strategic 
and international studies a private research group 
diouf who met with president bush earlier this week said 
senegal is committed to a democratic course pointing out that 17 
parties operate in his country 
he is highly regarded in washington because of his conservative 
economic policies support for an african common market and 
generally prowestern views 
diouf said that in light of the demise of communism in eastern 
europe last year marxist parties in senegal have become 
political invertebrates

arizonas senate approved a state holiday 
honoring martin luther king sending the bill to the house for a 
vote today despite demands that the racially sensitive issue be put 
to the voters 
the senate voted 1614 tuesday to create a paid king holiday for 
state employees and restore a paid columbus day holiday the 
measure would replace a law signed last year replacing columbus day 
with king day 
the house gave the measure tentative approval on a voice vote 
and gov rose mofford said she would sign it after a formal vote 
later today 
but opponents said they would gather signatures for a 
referendum they would have 90 days to do so and polls suggest 
that more than 80 percent of arizonans believe the issue should be 
decided by the voters 
opponents say an extra holiday would cost the state 500000 to 
35 million supporters point to a january report that conventions 
and meetings canceled because of years of fighting over a king 
holiday cost the state about 25 million in 198788 
the measures chief senate sponsor democrat carolyn walker 
said there was no need to let the voters have a say in what could 
become a racially divisive referendum 
i know there are those who say we are taking this away from 
the people she said i would like to remind them that the 
people elected us in the state of arizona as leaders 
republican sen doug todd said votes against the holiday had 
helped build a berlin wall of fear bigotry and hatred 
last years kingforcolumbus bill so angered king opponents and 
columbus supporters that they joined forces and gathered nearly 
twice the 43350 signatures needed to hold a referendum in 
november the law was suspended in the meantime 
approval of the new bill would wipe out that referendum but 
could lead to another 
former gov evan mecham who was impeached in 1988 and is 
running again has promised to put thousands of his volunteers into 
the field to help gather signatures he says the issue isnt king 
but the peoples right to vote 
democratic gov bruce babbitt declared a king holiday in 1986 
but mecham rescinded it days before it would have taken effect 
fortyseven other states have a holiday honoring king the other 
states without official king holidays are montana and new hampshire

labor secretary elizabeth dole moved wednesday 
to force americans making a career change to transfer their pension 
benefits to a new retirement account rather than spending the cash 
the proposal announced at a conference of the association of 
private pension and welfare plans would have to be approved by 
congress 
mrs dole said 80 percent of americans who receive retirement 
savings in a lump sum when they change jobs spend it rather than 
put it in a new retirement plan 
under mrs doles plan to promote pension portability a 
workers former employer would be required to transfer pension 
savings to the workers new pension plan or an individual 
retirement account 
the worker could retrieve the cash if it went into an ira but 
would have to pay a penalty 
a worker could not get to the money if it were transferred to a 
new pension plan savings would be routed to a new pension plan or 
an ira depending on what kind of pension plan the worker had 
we as a nation consume too much and save too litte mrs 
dole said adding that the change would ensure that workers can 
continue to achieve taxfree buildup on more of their retirement 
savings 
mrs dole said the nature of the workforce was changing 
the days of working for one employer for 30 to 40 years are 
now the exception and not the rule she said 
each year one in five working americans changes jobs and one in 
10 changes careers mrs dole said some experts predict the 
average worker will soon hold up to 10 jobs during his or her 
career she said 
mrs dole also called for expanding pension coverage for 
employees of small businesses so that as many as 55 million more 
american workers would be covered 
businesses with fewer than 25 workers often unable to provide 
complicated pension plans now may let their employees participate 
in simplified employee pensions which allow workers to defer 
up to nearly 8000 of their pretax salary by contributing it to 
iras 
mrs dole is proposing expanding that program to businesses with 
50 or fewer workers

dire economic problems in eastern europe are 
likely to worsen bringing recession unemployment and consumer 
shortages a cia report said wednesday 
the report released by members of the congressional joint 
economic committee said the newly emerging democracies in eastern 
europe could be rocked by unrest if the public is unwilling to 
accept hardships for years to come 
the publics tolerance for prolonged austerity will be the key 
to the success of the reforms and it remains largely untested 
even in poland the report said 
as long as aggressive implementation of austerity measures 
coincides with consumer shortages and a prolonged decline in living 
standards there will be a risk of public protest that could set 
back reforms and economic recovery cia analysts wrote in their 
report 
sen jeff bingaman dnm said the report underscored that the 
road to economic wellbeing will be long and arduous for the 
nations of eastern europe 
unemployment will be a big problem as countries try to transform 
their centrally planned economies into those dominated by market 
forces 
unemployment is likely to soar if the new governments 
vigorously pursue plans to break up large singleenterprise state 
monopolies restructure their economies eliminate state 
subsidies and let the market determine winners and losers the 
report said 
in poland joblessness could easily exceed 15 million or 9 
percent the study said unemployment is forecast at 15 to 20 
percent in east germany and yugoslavia and 5 percent or more in 
bulgaria and hungary 
the new democracies have economic hangovers because of four 
decades of economic mismanagement under communist governments 
the problems include slow or stagnant growth declining 
productivity energyintensive and obsolete heavy industries heavy 
foreign debts poorquality goods and noncompetitive exports 
massive environmental problems and deteriorating infrastructures 
to name a few 
others economic problems also threaten eastern europe the 
analysts said 
for instance heavy debt burdens and poor prospects for 
increasing export revenues will make it difficult for countries to 
pay their debts and modernize their economies 
then countries will have to determine how to distribute wealth 
the report said the struggle over privatization could be intense 
on top of the economic squeeze is the inexperience of the new 
governments some of which are coalitions of divergent groups the 
cia report said 
western nations will play a big role in getting the new 
democracies on their feet with financial aid and private 
investment the study said adding that joint ventures are viewed 
as particularly crucial 
while governments seem eager to help eastern europe longterm 
economic development will depend on how much private investment 
pours into the region it said bank lending to the region already 
shows signs of drying up the report said 
jeffrey sachs a harvard university professor who has worked 
with the polish government said the united states must move to 
become actively involved in development of the soviet union 
lets make clear to the soviet union that we will support 
economic reform in a measured careful way he said 
it is important for the soviets to know at a time of great 
insecurity and uncertainty that there is help out there 
sachs said 
last weekend president bush proposed spending 300000 to start 
up a volunteer corps to provide assistance to the democracies in 
eastern europe 
a similar proposal was introduced in the senate in march by 
sens david pryor dark nancy kassebaum rkan and slade 
gorton rwash

yeah 
q mr president if you cut taxes or if you cut if you raise 
taxes im sorry or if you cut spending either way there will be 
a drag on the economy unless interest rates also fall are you 
operating under an assumption or some kind of guarantee from the 
fed that that will happen 
a no theres no such guarantee id like to see interest rates 
falling and i think when you have a when the fears of inflation 
decline one might expect interest rates to come down but no i 
have no such guarantee 
q are you taking then a gamble that even if you come up with 
some kind of package that it wont help the actual the economic 
performance 
a well i think you raise a very good economic question and 
that is how much can be taken out of an economy what percentage of 
the gnp can be taken out in terms of taxes and not threaten the 
dynamism of the economy and one figure that ive heard bandied 
about is i want to be careful here but id say about 1 or 
were growing at what 2 percent and of each now it looks 
like were growing at 2 percent growth gnp and id say anything 
over half of that would be very you know risk doing what you 
say slowing down the economy further and thats exacerbating the 
problem rather than making it better 
yeah jerry 
q mr president if i could return to the budget negotiations 
for a second theres a lot of speculation of without getting 
into the details of the negotiations about why you personally 
decided the matter was urgent enough now to resort to this process 
is it because youre afraid interest rates might stop the economic 
growth that you want so much is it because the automatic spending 
cuts would be too painful for the country to absorb or are you 
just frustrated that the deficit continues to restrict your ability 
to maneuver on a lot of issues 
a well i think i want to say almost all of the above but 
its really that when you take a look at the most recent estimates 
and one of the ingredients in the shortfall has been interest 
rates is that the problem is of such a magnitude that we need to 
address it its more that than it is a fear of any specific 
category its just big enough that we have to do something about 
it and thats why ive taken the approach i have taken 
and i think but in here you see it is a place where we need 
to get understanding from the american people but i want to go 
there saying look heres the problem everybodys agreed on it 
now were not going to have some new organization come in and 
argue with the estimates and that means getting cbo and the omb 
together as much as possible heres a bipartisan answer taking 
a compromise here give and take there and this is what we must do 
as a nation on the deficit and im hopeful that we will be able 
to come forward with such an agreement that will enable me to do 
that 
q do you have a timetable of your own 
a no we talked about a timetable this morning jerry but we 
didnt do that has not been agreed with congress and again i 
want to work with them on these answers not do it just in the 
yeah owen 
q for some time youve hinted mr president that you would 
ban offshore oil drilling off the coast of florida can you tell 
us where you are now on that decision as well as the issue in 
california 
a a while back i said weeks and not months and today 
ill say days and not weeks because we just finished just 
concluded a meeting with those cabinet departments that have 
recommendations to make to the president and now weve got to sort 
it out internally but i cant give you an exact date but were 
getting very close to making recommendations in that regard 
q can you tell me is there a big difference in how you see the 
situation in florida compared with california 
a well i think ive already said that im concerned about the 
the the environmental aspects as it relates to florida albeit 
the drilling as i was told this morning if quite a ways off shore 
the projected the leases are but that is a highly sophisticated 
and sensitive area and so ive already said that but i dont want 
to suggest that i dont feel that way about certain areas off 
california 
another aspect of all this is the overall energy requirements of 
the country and regrettably im going to have to make a decision 
on this or feel compelled to before we have our whole energy 
study which is quite important and but i have to go forward 
anyway without that and its too bad i am increasingly concerned 
about our dependence on foreign oil so it is my responsibility 
then to balance out these needs 
two more right john and jesse and then ive got to go 
q mr president i know youre as a former member of the 
house that you know its not unusual for legislation to be loaded 
down with amendments have you exhausted all administrative relief 
for possibility of relief for panama and nicaragua and 
contingency funds 
a yes we have and we looked i tasked the treasury upon 
hearing from mrs chamorro to see if there is some way to arrange 
a bridge loan and as i said in my statement regrettably you 
cant make a bridge loan based on the on on pending 
legislation in other words using pending legislation to bridge 
it to pay it off and so weve tried very hard on that indeed i 
asked through general scowcroft the secretary of the treasury to 
see if we couldnt encourage private lending to help violetta get 
across this difficult problem and they run into collateral 
problems as well so it is a matter of dire urgency and its 
q did you tell the democratic leaders that yesterday 
a yes i did 
q could i ask you what did they say 
a well they said theyd try very hard and with fairness to 
speaker foley i talked to congressman jamie whitten about it and 
it is very frustrating and i think the american people are 
frustrated by the inability of the congress to do business in a 
prompt and orderly fashion i believe this has the support of the 
american people 
yeah jesse and then i really do have to run

plans to shut down radio free europe should be 
drafted now in the hope that democratic institutions become rooted 
in eastern europe an advisory panel recommended wednesday 
in its annual report the us advisory commission on public 
diplomacy said also that congressional directives to establish such 
services as tv marti which broadcasts to cuba reduce the 
flexibility needed to meet programming opportunities in eastern 
europe 
the panel said radio free europe broadcasts probably should 
eventually come to an end however it added that us government 
radio which has been broadcasting from west germany since the end 
of world war ii should continue operating in a united germany 
the continued broadcasts would serve as a major source of 
information about democracy and the united states for the 16 
million east germans who would join a united germany the report 
said 
radio free europe whose broadcasts to eastern europe have 
spanned four decades of cold war will have achieved its goals if 
democratic trends in eastern europe are sustained the panel said 
in addition the commission said a strategy should be developed 
now for transferring radio free europes assets to the voice of 
america whose broadcasts it said will become more important than 
ever 
the change should be made when democratic institutions and free 
media alternatives are well established in the region the panel 
said 
it added however that radio free europe should continue 
broadcasting while the possibility exists that the current wave of 
democratization could be reversed 
radio free europe was set up in 1950 with funds from the cia 
control was transferred to the independent board for international 
broadcasting in 1951 the radio service and radio liberty a 
companion service that broadcasts to the soviet union operate 
under an annual budget of about 400 million 
the bipartisan advisory panel was established by congress to 
oversee the international public affairs and educational exchange 
programs of the us government including the us information 
agency 
the panel said it deplored what it called a lack of cohesion and 
highlevel commitment to public diplomacy within the bush 
administration and called on the president to establish a national 
council on public diplomacy to coordinate efforts 
it said usia had been disappointingly slow in developing 
programs to take advantage of the collapse of rigid communist 
regimes in eastern europe 
it said the agencys work will become increasingly important as 
ideological and military competition is replaced by a focus on 
economic cultural and communications issues 
the panel recommended also that 
usias broadcast media emphasize democracy in action 
originating programs on the rule of law the role of a free press 
and adjusting national interests to ethnic differences those it 
said should combine with a range of programs that tell listeners 
how to organize a political party run a public meeting write a 
constitution or start a small business 
emphasis be placed on english language instruction 
commissions should be established in the newly democratic 
countries of eastern europe to begin and expand longterm scholarly 
exchanges 
potential foreign public reaction to proposed policies should 
play a part in all major policy decisions

millions more americans may have died from the 
effects of radiation releases from nuclear plants and bomb tests 
than acknowledged by the government the authors of a new book on 
the health effects of radiation said wednesday 
a spokeswoman for the commercial nuclear industry called the 
claim hysterical fearmongering 
benjamin a goldman and jay m gould authors of deadly 
deceit said their analysis of government mortality and radiation 
statistics showed death rates for infants and the elderly rose 
significantly in the aftermath of accidental radiation releases at 
nuclear plants in south carolina connecticut and pennsylvania in 
the 1970s 
goldman a researcher and author and gould a statistician 
also claim that radioactive fallout from the explosion of the 
chernobyl nuclear power plant in the soviet union in april 1986 
accelerated the deaths of about 40000 americans during the summer 
of 1986 
as the basis for this claim the authors cite government 
statistics that showed a 53 percent increase in reported us 
deaths in may 1986 compared with may 1985 they said this was the 
biggest may increase in 50 years and that the odds of this being a 
chance event unrelated to chernobyl were less than one in 1000 
the book also contends that deaths related to fallout from 
aboveground nuclear tests which were banned in 1963 may be far 
in excess of any previous estimates 
the authors reached this conclusion on the basis of national 
mortality tables that showed a steady decline in death rates in the 
united states until the 1950s when the rate flattened out the 
rate resumed falling after the early 1960s 
this 10year period of little or no improvement in the death 
rate coincided with the height of the us and soviet atmospheric 
nuclear testing programs 
we have estimated that this midcentury mortality failure 
could have been measured as equivalent to 9 million excess 
deaths as the difference between the observed number and what 
would be expected on the basis of pre1950s trends gould told a 
news conference 
the authors said they could not be entirely sure of the accuracy 
of their conclusions since they were formed on the basis of 
statistical anomalies and not scientific investigation of links 
between radiation doses and human health 
if it is not lowlevel radiation that caused this then it is 
up to the scientific community to explain what in gods name 
accounted for this gould said 
cathy roche a spokeswoman for the us council for energy 
awareness the nuclear industry trade group said the assertions by 
gould and goldman had been made previously and debunked by state 
and federal health authorities she said the authors have an 
antinuclear bias that skewed their analysis

q mr president many of the participants from yesterdays 
budget meeting came out shaking their heads and scratching their 
heads in frustration at the size of the problem as youve just 
talked about here the magnitude of the deficit problem and the 
lack of trust that appeared to be in the room in fact one of the 
participants said they all turned back their paper that they had 
written notes on so that no one would be able to quote from them 
and they all said they its going to take a lot of 
a that was a heartening development jessica 
q a lot of leadership im wondering what is it that you 
think you can do that can move the atmosphere forward the 
atmosphere of trust first of all so that people will believe in 
the good faith that you are expressing 
a i think there was i think there was a meeting that involved 
a fair degree of trust i dont think people think im trying to 
blindside them in the congress that might have been early on when 
i first said lets go no preconditions but i didnt get the 
feeling of distrust and when people headed handed the papers 
back it was so the process could work in an orderly fashion and 
it wasnt the republicans that suggested it as i recall it was a 
democratic leader who said just leave these and let our group 
thats going to meet on thursday discuss these matters and discuss 
it in a you know as quiet a surrounding as possible without 
having a big flurry out there surrounding the discussions and so 
i think that i interpreted that as a determination to work 
together jessica not the other way i hope im right 
q but they all say that theres a stalemate about how to 
address the one side of the equation the tax side of the equation 
thats going to take leadership to move things someones going to 
have to move first now do you have some 
a thats what the process will do no tricks no tricks in the 
bag but when you start a negotiation a labor management 
negotiation they get behind closed doors and they say now look 
heres our view and what is yours and reasonable people go 
forward and try to negotiate so i think the democrats did come 
down some of them saying well you should go first 
and i said to them wait a minute who appropriates all the 
money wheres the revenue whos got the obligation under the 
constitution to raise the revenue so lets not talk about whos 
going first 
weve got a problem we have a national problem and i want to 
be a part of having the american people understand the problem and 
i want to have an answer to the american people that i know can 
work 
and its not going to work with just republicans or just the 
white house or just the democrats 
so i think we got over that hurdle i hope we did of 
suspicion and im trying very hard here today because these are 
good tough questions about procedure and substance and i am not 
going to get into those i am going to try to keep my share of the 
bargain by not discussing what we might do or might not do what my 
bottom line is what my opening wedge is because once i do that 
youll have 435 people in the house doing it and 100 in the senate 
and that isnt the way were going to solve this national problem 
thank you all very very much 
q another one on the philippines 
a philippines 
q yes do we need those bases there now as much as we did in 
the past 
a i thought our negotiator made a very sound statement rich 
armitage on the philippines because what he pointed out is there 
we dont have a total blank check regarding this 
and theres another point he made and if were not wanted 
there were not going to be there and so this isnt something 
that is absolutely essential to the united states it is those 
are great facilities those two facilities and we will negotiate 
in good faith but there are certain parameters there are certain 
limits to what i will do what i will accept as president and 
its very important that in dealing in good faith that the 
philippine government and its leaders know that and i thats why 
i strongly support what rich armitage said or what i saw that he 
said on the television which is almost that 
q will we be able to protect our interests in the pacific if 
were thrown out of the philippines 
a yeah there are other ways to skin this cat but some of them 
are quite expensive and some of them are less expensive but you 
can be assured i am looking at those options

west germany said wednesday it was 
creating a 70 billion fund to help rebuild east germanys 
shattered economy the opposition said the move raised new 
questions about unifications real costs 
details of the plan were outlined at a news conference by west 
germanys finance minister who said costs of the program would be 
borne by the federal government and the 11 west german states 
meanwhile the west german government said a treaty to formally 
merge the two german economies on july 2 will be signed at a 
ceremony in bonn on friday the announcement was made by chancellor 
helmut kohls chief spokesman hans klein 
the two germanys have been negotiating the economic merger since 
march talks have centered on replacing east germanys nearly 
worthless currency with west germanys mighty mark and creating a 
strong social security net for east germans 
negotiations on the economic merger had been complicated by east 
german fears of widespread joblessness as the countrys economy 
undergoes a total overhaul but the two sides were able to reach 
agreement this week as planned 
in another development a west german goverment official said 
kohl and east german prime minister lothar de maiziere would speak 
soon about possible dates for an allgerman vote 
alfred dregger parliamentary leader for kohls christian 
democrats said kohl and de maiziere will be having contacts 
in which an election date will be in the forefront 
kohls government which supports speedy unification is 
pressing for united german elections as early as dec 2 when west 
german national elections are slated de maiziere has not said what 
he thinks of holding allgerman elections this year 
but east german foreign minister markus meckel a leader of the 
opposition social democratic party said an early date for joint 
elections is not in our interest 
like the east german party west germanys social democrats 
favor slower unfication and oppose united elections this year 
a leading official in kohls coalition michaela geiger gave 
another reason for holding early elections uncertainty over how 
the troubles of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev could affect 
german unity 
we dont know exactly how things will be continuing in the 
soviet union she said its therefore very important to 
quickly complete unification after we have the approval of all 
participants 
west germanys finance minister theo waigel said the agreement 
to create a fund to aid the east german economy was reached 
wednesday by the governors of west germanys 11 states and federal 
officials 
he said 575 billion will be raised on the domestic capital 
market with the federal government providing 50 percent and the 11 
states sharing the other half another 121 billion will come from 
federal budget savings he said 
but east germany must begin quickly turning over stateowned 
property to private owners to cover further costs the finance 
minister said 
the opposition social democrats said the move supported their 
charges that kohl has not been forthcoming about what the merger of 
the two germanys will cost 
ingrid matthaeusmaier the social democrats parliamentary 
leader said the fund will cover only part of unification costs 
hansjochen vogel the social democrats national chairman 
repeated a demand that the kohl government detail the mergers 
price 
also wednesday it was announced in east berlin that east 
germanys central bank president horst kaminsky was retiring 
immediately for health reasons kaminsky had headed the central 
bank since 1974 
east germanys central bank will lose most of its power when the 
two german economies are merged because its west german 
counterpart the bundesbank will control monetary policy of both 
germanys

the food and drug administration said 
wednesday it wants to ban 258 ingredients in overthecounter 
remedies used to treat conditions ranging from acne to warts 
the ingredients have not been proved effective the fda said 
the agency and an industry official said many of the ingredients no 
longer are used 
the fda announced a similar proposal earlier this month to ban 
more than 100 unproven ingredients used in nonprescription diet or 
appetite suppression drug products 
the two proposals are the latest developments in the fdas 
massive review of all ingredients in an estimated 300000 
nonprescription products the review began in 1972 and is expected 
to be completed in 1993 
john walden of the nonprescription drug manufacturers said he 
found nothing earthshattering on the list of ingredients to be 
banned and agreed with the fda that companies have had ample time 
to show the ingredients were effective 
most of them have been taken out of the preparations in 
which they had been used he said 
the ingredients that would be banned were or are used in drugs 
treating a variety of conditions including allergies boils cold 
symptoms dandruff ingrown toenails pain psoriasis thumbsucking 
and swimmers ear 
the fda said it would issue a final rule after a 60day comment 
period

the government is failing to adequately 
recognize or regulate chemicals that lead to alzheimers and 
parkinsons diseases and other neurological disorders a 
congressional report says 
a study by the office of technology assessment said federal 
agencies must give more attention to nervous system disorders 
caused in part by environmental toxins and should do the research 
necessary for new rulemaking 
millions of american workers are exposed to neurotoxic 
substances in the workplace but illness stemming from these 
exposures often goes undetected and untreated the study said 
because of inadequate research it said little is known about 
the potentially adverse effects of thousands of these chemicals on 
the nervous system 
the report called for congress to consider increasing spending 
on research into the effects of toxic chemicals on the nervous 
system to provide additional funds for toxicity testing and 
monitoring of groups of people exposed to such chemicals and to 
better coordinate a federal regulatory program for neurotoxic 
substances 
chronic neurotoxicity presents a health risk every bit as 
large and as tragic as cancer yet almost nothing is being done 
about it sen albert gore said in releasing the report our 
regulatory system is virtually blind to this risk 
gore chairman of a senate technology subcommittee told a 
capitol news conference that the office of management and budget 
denied a plea by the environmental protection agency for an 
additional 15 million to conduct research on the problem i 
would hope we could end this footdragging the tennessee 
democrat added 
the report said more than 65000 toxic substances and chemicals 
are in use and many can damage the nervous system causing or 
contributing to such disorders as parkinsons disease alzheimers 
disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis known as lou gehrigs 
disease 
the neurotoxic substances range from industrial chemicals and 
drugs to food additives and ingredients in cosmetics

grappling with whether to remove preferential trade conditions from 
china to protest its repression of democracy advocates

it isnt an easy call he said at a news conference 
bush has until june 3 the first anniversary of the crackdown in 
which chinese demonstrators were killed near beijings tiananmen 
square to decide whether to seek extension of the 
mostfavorednation status for chinese exports to the united states

government will make this year and certainly the most important 
with respect to china said rep stephen solarz chairman of the 
house foreign affairs subcommittee on asia 
winston lord us ambassador to beijing from 1985 until last 
year told two congressional subcommittees that bush should extend 
the trade provisions for another year 
lord who broke with the bush administration over its policy on 
china also said the concessions should be accompanied by strong 
gestures of support for democracy and human rights within china 
lord said it should be made clear that if conditions do not 
improve inside china its leaders cannot expect mfn to be 
preserved a year from now

eye and nearly took his life 
an actor singer dancer and impressionist the exuberant davis 
lived life hard and fast his gold chains heavy rings and gaudy 
bracelets were as much a part of his personality as the chain of 
cigarettes he smoked 
his work on stage screen and television displayed a versatility 
matched by few though scorned by some as merely a gilded las vegas 
drone and criticized by others as being a token of the rat 
pack davis was greatly admired and respected as an entertainers 
entertainer 
he gave his heart and soul to every performance and he was a 
true american institution there will never be another one like

two nebraska democrats who finished just 94 votes apart faced 
the prospect wednesday of a timeconsuming recount to determine who 
earns the right to run against republican gov kay orr 
in pennsylvania auditor general barbara hafer won a gop primary 
to challenge democratic gov robert p casey but she said a strong 
showing by her antiabortion opponent sends a message to the 
prochoice people that we are not organized 
with complete but unofficial returns from nebraskas sevenman 
democratic primary tuesday bill hoppner a former aide to sen bob 
kerrey led with 44281 votes or 27 percent ben nelson an omaha 
lawyer and former state insurance director had 44187 or 27 
percent 
hoppner said he was beginning immediately to campaign for 
novembers general election obviously its better to be 94 
votes ahead than 94 votes behind he said you only need one 
more to win 
said nelson im not going to operate as though i lost its 
more like operating in a bit of limbo he said his campaign might 
try to shorten what officials said could be a 27day process for a 
recount 
canvassing boards in each county will meet thursday to begin 
counting remaining absentee ballots said ralph englert deputy 
secretary of state 
state law requires the recount if the runnerup appears to lose 
by a margin equal to 1 percent or less of the votes received by the 
leader 
the board of state canvassers will meet june 11 to determine if 
there will be an automatic recount if so it would begin june 13 
englert said 
mrs orr the nations first republican woman elected governor 
of any state won her own primary defeating omaha businessman mort 
sullivan by a 6931 percent margin but democrats said that only 
showed her vulnerability 
let me point out that her opponent hardly a household name 
got 30 percent of the vote thats hardly a show a of strength 
kerrey said 
former omaha mayor mike boyle who led the democratic field much 
of the night finished third with 41154 votes or 25 percent 
followed by lincoln mayor bill harris with 31361 or 19 percent 
in pennsylvania hafer who is prochoice and had the backing of 
the state gop defeated marguerite luksik of johnstown in a race 
that was closer than expected casey who like luksik is strongly 
opposed to abortion easily dispatched a prochoice democratic 
opponent 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting casey had 630892 votes 
or 77 percent to 184656 or 23 percent for lawyer philip s berg 
hafer had 319670 votes or 54 percent to luksiks 268563 votes 
or 46 percent 
this should send a message to the people who want me to be the 
next governor of pennsylvania that it is incumbent on us to 
understand that choice is a very very very big issue hafer 
said 
here are highlights of other results in tuesdays voting 
pennsylvania democratic lt gov mark s singel like casey an 
opponent of abortion survived a challenge on the issue from former 
state party chairman edward mezvinsky 
nebraska twoterm democratic sen james exon had no primary 
opposition and former republican rep hal daub won the gop 
nomination piling up 92 percent of the vote against omaha landlord 
otis glebe 
oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer won the republican 
primary for governor gaining 79 percent of the vote in a sevenway 
race he will compete in november against democratic secretary of 
state barbara roberts 
sen mark hatfield defeated environmentalist randy prince with 
78 percent of the vote in to win the republican nomination for a 
fifth term his november challenger businessman harry lonsdale 
took 63 percent of the vote in a sixway race 
residents of the college town of eugene soundly defeated a 
measure to toughen an ordinance banning the local manufacture of

household plumbing fixtures should come with 
safety devices that shut off when water gets hot enough to burn a 
small child a childrens advocacy group said wednesday 
such safety valves would help prevent scaldings that send 100 
children a day to hospital emergency rooms nationwide the national 
safe kids campaign said 
this year 37000 children under the age of 14 will be 
injured by a scald burn severely enough to receive emergency 
medical treatment said former surgeon general c everette koop 
most he said will be injured in their homes by tap water hot 
beverages or food in less than the time it takes you to answer 
the telephone in an adjoining room 
the majority of the incidents will occur while children are 
unattended said koop who is chairman of the safe kids campaign 
it happens all the time every day 100 children are taken to 
emergency rooms with scald burns in this country he said 
just three seconds in tap water over 140 degrees fahrenheit 
can cause a thirddegree burn requiring hospitalization and skin 
grafts koop added the group said water temperatures as high as 
180 degrees have been recorded in urban apartment buildings 
the coalition a nonprofit organization founded in 1988 to help 
prevent childhood injuries said wednesday it would work to amend 
local plumbing and construction codes to include stricter 
regulations for fixtures that control water temperatures and 
regulate water pressure 
ann parsons and kim snyder nurses in the burn unit at 
childrens national medical center in washington praised the safe 
kids initiative saying 50 percent of the burns they treat are from 
scaldings 
what gives us a little red mark can give a small child a 
first or seconddegree burn parsons said 
safe kids also will help provide the saftey valves for faucets 
bathtubs and showers in lowincome homes with children under five 
the average cost for retrofitting fixtures in older homes is 13 
per sink 17 per shower and 40 per bathtub members of the group 
said however safe kids will provide the installations for 5 each 
to lowincome residents 
the coalition has launched a pilot project to install the 
devices in homes in seven cities

freed american hostage robert polhill has a 
cancerous growth around his vocal cords that will require surgeons 
to remove his voice box his physicians said wednesday 
such radical surgery scheduled for thursday might have been 
avoided if the tumor had been diagnosed sooner doctors said 
the tumor is quite old probably at least a year col russ 
zajtchuk deputy commander of clinical services at walter reed 
medical center said at a news conference 
if it had been discovered earlier he probably wouldnt have 
to lose his voice box provided he had the right radiation 
therapy zajtchuk said 
there is no evidence the cancer has spread but polhills 
treatment will include radiation therapy zajtchuk said 
polhill 55 was held captive by shiite moslems in lebanon for 
39 months before being released april 22 
we are going to overcome this ordeal we are survivors and we 
are definitely going to survive this ordeal ferial polhill said 
at the news conference which her husband did not attend 
polhill has told his doctors he was visited by physicians eight 
or 10 times during his captivity 
im pretty sure they didnt examine his throat zajtchuk 
said 
hes a smoker and this condition is related to smoking 
zajtchuk said adding that polhill told him his captors had kept 
him in cigarettes 
the growth is involving both vocal cords one vocal cord the 
left is paralyzed zajtchuk said the tumor also extends below 
the vocal cords so it is quite an extensive lesion 
polhills weak raspy voice prompted early discovery of the 
tumor a full diagnosis was put off until polhill a diabetic and 
who was 25 pounds underweight when he was released gained enough 
stamina to undergo the general anesthesia necessary for a biopsy 
polhill was told after the biopsy last week that the growth was 
cancerous and agreed to surgery public disclosure was postponed 
to give polhill time to tell members of his family zajtchuk said 
mrs polhill said her husbands spirits were very high very 
positive strong polhills mother ruth nodded agreement 
zajtchuk said polhill had begun working with a speech therapist 
to explore various methods for voice communication once the larynx 
is removed 
one common method involves the use of an electronic device that 
emulates the voice box another technique involves swallowing air 
and regurgitating it in a way that forms words 
a third possibility one not favored for radiation patients 
requires a tracheotomy the insertion of a breathing tube in the 
throat 
his mental status is remarkable zajtchuk said imagine a 
fellow being locked up for 3 years and then he comes to walter 
reed and he virtually gets locked up again and then he cant 
communicate because hes going to lose his voice box 
polhill is expected to spend about two weeks in the hospital 
after the surgery then will undergo radiation treatments 
polhill has made several excursions out of the hospital since he 
returned to the united states he visited president bush at the 
white house and attended a dinner to celebrate his 10th wedding 
anniversary 
he also has visited frank reed a fellow hostage who was 
released this month reed has been recuperating at a hospital at 
nearby andrews air force base md

arkansas gov bill clinton said wednesday the 
federal government could do more for the poor people of the lower 
mississippi delta through development programs than with the 
welfare payments now sent 
if we were a foreign country we might get more development 
aid clinton chairman of the lower mississippi delta commission 
told a house hearing 
he said millions of dollars in welfare money now going to the 
region keep the 8 million residents there just above starvation 
wouldnt development be better so they can start sending 
money back to you clinton a democrat said at a joint meeting 
of subcommittees with jurisdiction over programs sought by the 
commission 
the commission released a report this week based on an 18month 
study of the problems in the 219 counties of louisiana 
mississippi arkansas missouri illinois tennessee and kentucky 
that comprise the delta 
anyone who reads this report can see we ask more of ourselves 
than the federal government clinton said of 400 recommendations 
for federal state and local action 
he said congress should first decide which of the 
recommendations can be carried out immediately by the bush 
administration 
the suggestions should then be organized by cost 
he could not estimate the total cost of the suggestions in the 
186page report but said improvements to roads and highways 
probably would be the most expensive 
clinton said the states would pool money to set up an office 
that would lobby for the recommendations after the 
congressionallycreated commission goes out of business sept 30 
rep mike espy dmiss whose constituents are among the poorest 
in the nation and rep bill emerson rmo have created a working 
group of 24 house members who say they also will be advocates for 
the report 
its my first priority said espy i think well see some 
material action this year on these projects 
in his testimony clinton called for reauthorization of the 
national health service corps act at 1985 levels he said congress 
should provide special provisions for placement of physicians in 
the delta and revise medicaidmedicare reimbursement formulas to 
help rural hospitals 
we also ask states to do the same he said he also 
suggested immediate action to improve education agriculture 
housing and community development utilities highways and private 
enterprise 
we ask you to immediately agree on a bill that increases the 
number of subsidized day care positions for lowincome families 
which will help welfare mothers go to work and not take a financial 
loss clinton said 
agriculture has been and will continue to be a major economic 
resource for the delta said clinton we recommend that a delta 
agriculture technology transfer program be developed by colleges 
and universities with the support of federal and state governments 
to disseminate information and training to farmers on the latest 
agriculture technology 
he also asked congress to support a national biotechnology 
cooperative project in the region to generate private investment 
and educational opportunities and contribute research

shifting patterns on the television screen when 
youngsters play video games can on rare occasions trigger 
epileptic seizures a doctor warns 
the doctor described one such case as that of a 13yearold girl 
who played a nintendo game steadily for three hours 
seizures caused by flickering light are called photosensitive 
epilepsy it is uncommon and occurs in about 2 percent to 3 percent 
of people with epilepsy in these people ordinary television 
disco strobe lights or sunlight seen flashing through leaves while 
riding in a car may touch off a seizure 
while video games also may trigger seizures in people who 
already have epilepsy they do not cause the underlying disorder 
the latest example was reported by dr edward j hart of the 
franciscan childrens hospital in boston his letter headlined 
nintendo epilepsy was published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine 
he noted that a similar episode dubbed dark warrior 
epilepsy was described in the british medical journal eight 
years ago 
in a statement nintendo of america said the company is 
sympathetic to those who suffer from photosensitive epilepsy it 
urged victims to consult their doctors 
in the same issue of the journal dr richard brasington of the 
marshfield clinic in wisconsin described another potential hazard 
of too much game playing nintendinitis 
he described a 35yearold woman who woke up with a sore thumb 
the day after she played nonstop nintendo for five hours the pain 
went away after she took a pain killer and avoided video games for 
a few days 
to this nintendo replied we believe the amount of game play 
necessary to induce such symptoms is extraordinary and consequently 
we believe these instances occur quite infrequently

israeli and finnish authorities are 
working out a plan to allow soviet jews immigrating to israel to 
use a small airport on the finnishsoviet border as a transit 
point official sources said wednesday 
the pact would make finland the fourth major route for jews 
emigrating from the soviet union the others are hungary romania 
and poland 
under the plan to take effect early in june convoys of finnish 
buses will begin shuttling emigrants from the soviet union to 
lappeenranta a finnish town of 54000 people about 12 miles from 
the soviet border the sources said they spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
israelichartered aircraft will fly the soviets directly to tel 
aviv within hours of their arrival in finland said the sources 
speaking by telephone from finland 
a report that lappeenranta would become an air bridge for soviet 
jews also appeared wednesday in helsingin sanomat finlands 
leading daily newspaper it quoted unnamed israeli sources 
finnish radio reported wednesday that president mauno koivisto 
had rebuffed a call from palestine liberation organization chairman 
yasser arafat to abandon the project 
in response to a letter from the plo chief koivisto wrote that 
finlands decision to allow the transit of jews was based on 
humanitarian principles and the freedom of movement the radio said 
but koivisto also told arafat that finland understood that the 
israeli government would not settle the new immigrants in the 
israelioccupied territories 
the sources said plans call for the transit of several hundred 
emigrants every month in the first stage and possibly thousands 
monthly later on 
israel said about 10500 soviet jews arrived in april a monthly 
record since the soviet union opened the gates last year to most 
jews who want to leave 
the finns announced in march they had agreed to let soviet jews 
pass through their territory but the negotiations for mass transit 
were held in strict secrecy in the face of arab opposition 
reports from israel on the subject were quashed by military 
censorship 
the sources claimed finland received explicit threats of 
terrorist reprisals if the transit plan proceeds they did not say 
by whom or to whom the threats were made 
should there be some sort of terrorist threat a clear 
concrete threat we have had plans in readiness for some time to 
deal with it said police inspector teuvo ikonen on finnish radio 
lappeenranta airport cannot handle large aircraft requiring long 
runways but the town was reportedly chosen because its proximity to 
the soviet border reduces security risks

a private research group on wednesday proposed 
restructuring the nations health care system to give consumers 
more control over the prices they pay and quality of care they 
receive 
john goodman president of the dallasbased national center for 
policy analysis said the plan differed from most of the dozens of 
health care reform proposals because it would rely on the 
freeenterprise system 
it is designed to appeal largely to small businesses and the 
selfemployed which comprise a large part of the estimated 31 
million americans without health insurance 
the plan would abolish state regulations that require insurance 
companies to cover certain costs this would allow insurers to 
offer nofrills plans which cost less because they pay only for 
catastrophic illness he said also deductibles on all insurance 
plans would be raised to 1000 
the centers plan would give individuals a tax credit for a 
portion of their health insurance premiums he said this would 
give people who are not offered health insurance by an employer tax 
advantages now available only for employerprovided health 
insurance 
people would be encouraged to put money saved by these tax 
credits and other personal funds into their own medisave 
account they would use this money to pay the smaller 
noncatastrophic medical bills for which they could negotiate 
prices with providers goodman said 
the proposal was outlined in a report prepared by researchers 
from 40 research organizations and universities but goodman said 
not all of the researchers agreed with every recommendation he 
said he drafted the framework for the proposal

european tour and is to meet with president bush in washington on 
june 18

sanctions imposed on south africa in september 1987 in protest of 
the nations apartheid policies they include a ban on new 
investments and imports of oil and kruegerrand gold coins and a 
reduction in sports contacts 
the sanctions were seen as symbolic and israeli officials said 
at the time they would not seriously hurt the annual 240 million 
in trade between the two countries

cooperated closely in producing cruise missiles and fighter 
aircraft israel also has sold fast patrol boats 
surfacetosurface missiles and rifles to south africa according

once a sprawling frontier town of more than 10000 residents 
virginia city had a population of 190 as counted in the 1980

president bush said wednesday that he wont 
yield to pressure from democrats to go first in proposing tax 
and spending cuts needed to bring the federal budget deficit under 
control 
nor will he make a primetime television address to the nation 
on budget problems in the absence of a deal with congress bush 
told a news conference 
i dont want to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the 
markets bush said adding that he would make such an address 
at the appropriate time 
some congressional democrats criticized bush on wednesday a day 
after the first budget summit talks for refusing to go directly to 
the public with the economic bad news that prompted him to call a 
summit on the budget deficit 
if were in such bad straits the american people ought to 
hear it and lets get on with fixing the crisis said rep 
barbara boxer dcalif a member of the house budget committee 
democrats kept the pressure on bush to give the deficit a 
higherprofile stance despite his arguments against the primetime 
television appearance 
he should be speaking out said rep david bonior dmich 
if hes so concerned about this foreign aid going to nicaragua 
and panama he should be as concerned about these budget deficits 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee and a budget summit negotiator said bush must start 
now to sell the dimensions of the problem and go before the people 
to talk about the seriousness of it 
it should be a major address to the american people bentsen 
said the longer he waits the more difficult it will be 
bush said he was optimistic after the first round of budget 
negotiations saying the session involved a fair degree of trust 
i dont think people think im trying to blindside them in the 
congress 
the president offered no apologies for his decision not to 
present an opening proposal on deficitcutting steps to get the 
budget talks moving his refusal to list specifics helped fuel 
democratic suspicions that he was trying to blame them for tax 
increases 
the democrats did come down some of them saying well you 
should go first bush said i said wait a minute who 
appropriates all the money whos got the obligation under the 
constitution to raise the revenues taxes 
so lets not talk about whos going first weve got a 
problem we have a national problem bush added 
bush said he was hopeful that he and democrats had gotten over 
the hurdle of suspicion 
a second bargaining session which the president will not 
attended will be held thursday on capitol hill 
bush said he intended to keep my share of the bargain by not 
signaling what we might do or might not do what my bottom line 
what my opening wedge is 
because once i do that youll have 435 people in the house do 
it and 100 in the senate he added 
speaking to reporters in the white house briefing room bush was 
asked if he considers the current budget situation a test of his 
leadership on a major domestic problem he responded i expect 
so 
as he has before bush sidestepped the issue of new taxes 
saying he did not want to comment on any issues that might be up 
for negotiation 
asked if a tax existed that would not be a drag on the economy 
bush declared youre trying to get me to do that which just one 
second ago i wouldnt do 
however on the prospect of reaching a budget compromise that 
can win the support of the adminstration and a majority of both 
house and senate the president said after some initial 
posturing around well make some headway 
bush said he hopes to see interest rates fall but had no 
guarantee from the federal reserve that the central bank would act 
to force rates down 
the adminstration has blamed the widening deficit gap on rising 
interest rates along with lowerthanexpected revenues and a 
higherthan expected pricetag on the savings and loan bailout 
budget director richard g darman has said the deficit could 
near 200 billion next year unless action is taken 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush planned 
no television speech because the public already knows the problem 
we talk about the problems all the time so a televised 
address on the budget is not needed fitzwater said we talk 
about the deficit everybody knows what the deficit is

homeowners cant be assured that all radon 
tests are reliable despite government attempts to verify their 
accuracy congressional investigators said wednesday 
the environmental protection agency annually monitors test 
procedures and the accuracy of radon test kits from hundreds of 
testing companies and allows manufacturers to promote the fact that 
their kits are epa approved 
however officials of the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress told a house science space and 
technology subcommittee that the epa review does not necessarily 
assure homeowners that the test information is accurate 
the voluntary nature of the government program allows firms 
to market devices that fail the program or that have not been 
tested said richard hembra of the gao 
gao investiations he said have shown that some companies sell 
test kits that did not meet government standards or kits that had 
not been reviewed by the epa in a few cases companies submitted 
one type of device for review and put another type on the market 
he said 
various public interest groups also have complained that the epa 
monitoring program for radon test kits allows companies to know 
beforehand when one of their test samples is being examined so 
special precautions can be taken 
the epa estimates that as many as 20000 lungcancer deaths are 
attributed to indoor radon contamination making radon the second 
greatest cause of lung cancer after smoking 
if radon levels in a home are found to be greater than 4 
picocuries per liter of air the epa said levels should be reduced 
radon is a colorless odorless radioactive gas emitted from the 
earth the concern arises when the gas becomes trapped in closed 
homes and accumulates to unhealthy levels a radon problem often 
can be resolved by increasing ventilation authorities say 
a rapidly growing radontesting industry has emerged in recent 
years although the epa does not require testing for radon 
hembra cited a gao study late last year that indicated many of 
the test kits dont meet federal standards and said additional 
reviews continue to raise questions about test accuracy 
even with the increased number of firms demonstrating 
proficiency in measuring radon epa and the public still cannot be 
assured that all companies meet proficiency standards or that 
measurement results are accurate on a daytoday basis hembra 
said 
because epa review is voluntary hembra some testing companies 
can continue to market kits that have not been reviewed by the epa 
or failed epa scrutiny the agency also does not require companies 
to implement quality assurance programs 
henry habicht the epas deputy adminstrator said the agency 
was expanding socalled blind tests during which companies are 
not aware that one of their kits is under agency scrutiny 
he said the epa also is requiring that testing companies in the 
review program develop quality assurance programs but acknowledged 
participation remains voluntary

two computer dealers turned into hightech 
bandits in a scheme to illegally ship a supercomputer to 
bulgaria the us customs service charged wednesday 
an eta 10 mainframe computer made by control data corp was 
awaiting shipment to marseilles france when it was seized tuesday 
in two shipping containers at the port of charleston sc said 
miami customs chief william rosenblatt 
what we have here basically is two hightech entrepreneurs in 
the businesss who because of their greed and avarice became 
hightech bandits he said technically this computer could 
run a whole city 
one man was arrested in charleston and the other when he arrived 
in miami allegedly to collect 1 million for the computer 
the 9ton computer is banned for sale to east bloc countries 
because of its potential military applications customs officials 
said 
if in fact the computer had gone to an eastern bloc country as 
they thought it was going to the damage to the united states in my 
opinion would have been immeasurable rosenblatt said at a news 
conference 
only seven eta 10s have been exported legally and customs 
spokesman michael sheehan said the agency believes the seized 
supercomputer was the most sophisticated anyone has ever tried to 
ship illegally 
the investigation began in january with a tip from an informant 
who had been approached by the two men who said they were 
interested in selling an eta 10 customs said 
under the direction of customs agents in miami the informant 
told the men he wasnt interested in the computer himself but had 
contacts in the east bloc who were 
the illegal nature of the enterprise was constantly noted by 
the customs source who cautioned that substantial documentation 
and commerce department approval were required for the sale said a 
customs service news release 
but the men said they knew the requirements and would produce 
false documents agents said 
robert wheeler 44 president of american technology trading 
group ltd in san francisco was arrested in charleston and later 
released on 100000 bond 
nick spiliotis 44 president of cid corp of long beach 
calif was taken into custody in miami and was being held pending 
an appearance before a us magistrate 
both were charged with violating the export administration act 
which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a 
100000 fine

president bush said wednesday the soviet 
effort to block independence drives in the baltic republics 
certainly puts some tension on his summit with mikhail s 
gorbachev but would not stand in the way of nuclear arms talks 
bush held out hope the superpowers can agree soon to cut 
longrange nuclear weapons when he meets with gorbachev in two 
weeks 
appearing to choose his words with great care bush said i 
wouldnt say that it appears unlikely that he and gorbachev would 
be able to sign a treaty framework on nuclear arms during their 
four days of talks 
i would not predict that these matters cannot be resolved in 
time for the summit he said 
us officials have complained that moscow has backtracked in 
arms talks clouding prospects for a deal 
bush at a wideranging news conference said he was awaiting 
word from secretary of state james a baker iii who is in moscow 
trying to break the stalemate 
the president met with reporters one day after the opening of 
budget talks with congress and he expressed optimism about 
reaching an agreement to cut the burgeoning deficit 
while rejecting democratic calls that he go first with a 
comprehensive package of his own bush said he had no tricks in 
the bag he declined to say what tax increases if any he would 
accept 
spurning democrats suggestions that he make a televised address 
on the economys problems bush said he wanted to wait until he had 
a bipartisan solution 
the president said he did not want to do something that might 
inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten stock markets 
right now the markets are reasonably optimistic and there are 
reasons to be optimistic about the economy 
opening the news conference bush made an urgent appeal to 
congress to approve 300 million in economic aid for nicaragua and 
500 million for panama 
he urged the house and senate to cancel a planned memorial day 
recess next week if necessary to enact the legislation i think 
the american people are frustrated by the inability of the congress 
to do business in a prompt and orderly fashion he said 
however bush said he would veto the aid bill if congress 
included a provision involving federal money for abortions in the 
district of columbia 
bush said he was unable to provide a 40 million temporary loan 
requested by nicaraguan president violeta chamorro because the 
nicaraguans have no assured means of repayment and our hands are 
tied 
on other points bush said 
he has not decided whether to grant an extension of 
mostfavorednation trade benefits for china bush said there are 
strong arguments not to terminate the benefits but that he did not 
want to signal that he was happy with beijings record on human 
rights 
he will announce a decision in days and not weeks on 
whether to permit offshore oil drilling near the coasts of florida 
and california while citing environmental concerns bush said he 
did not want the united states to become more dependent on foreign 
oil 
the united states would reluctantly give up its two military 
bases in the philippines if the government of corazon aquino 
demands too high a price there are other ways to skin this 
cat bush said referring to alternate basing proposals 
moscows efforts against independence moves taken by lithuania 
estonia and latvia have put a deep strain on ussoviet relations 
a senior administration official commenting after bushs news 
conference said the issue was the most difficult problem in our 
relationship 
bush said id say that it has certainly put some tension on 
the summit 
we want to see negotiations or dialogue or whatever you call 
it discussions between gorbachev and the lithuanians get going 
he said and then id like to see the release of that economic 
pressure on lithuania 
and that would clear the air bush said 
still the president made clear that the dispute would not stand 
in the way of his meeting with gorbachev 
we have a broad agenda of items that we must go forward on 
bush said we have negotiated with the soviets when all of 
eastern europe was in captivity and when we had cold war times 
he said he wanted to see the baltic states gain their 
independence but that i feel its important from our standpoint 
the important standpoint of eastern european countries and western 
european allies and indeed the whole world that we have these 
discussions with mr gorbachev 
turning to bills being considered in congress bush expressed 
confidence about reaching agreement on civil rights legislation 
that would reverse recent supreme court rulings making it more 
difficult to prove employer discrimination and easier to challenge 
the legality of affirmative action plans 
however he said he had real problems with legislation that 
would require companies to provide leave time for new parents i 
think it boils down to the concept of whether you are in favor of 
mandated benefits or now bush said 
asked about the six remaining american hostages in lebanon bush 
said i have seen no reason to be encouraged that the process 
toward their release is under way

special payments to vietnam veterans who were 
exposed to the herbicide agent orange are not subject to federal 
income tax the internal revenue service ruled wednesday 
an estimated 60000 us military personnel and their survivors 
are eligible for payments from a fund created in 1984 as a result 
of a classaction lawsuit against several manufacturers of the 
chemical payments are restricted to those who served in vietnam 
between 1961 and 1972 
the administrator of the fund asked the irs for a ruling on 
whether the payments or interest earned on investment of the funds 
assets were taxable income the irs said the money is not taxable 
because it is considered compensation for personal injuries 
the fund administrator gave the irs permission to make the 
private ruling public said irs spokesman steve pyrek 
many veterans say they suffered lasting injury to their health 
by being exposed to agent orange which us forces used to 
defoliate vietnamese jungles

there has been much argument over the past two 
decades about the exact merits of sesame street but none over 
the crucial role jim hensons muppets played in the television 
programs phenomenal popularity 
it was unclear wednesday what affect hensons death would have 
on the program which is produced by the childrens television 
workshop 
theres no way of telling said mary sue holland a 
spokeswoman for ctw we honestly dont know 
sesame street reaches 11 million american households and is 
broadcast in 80 foreign nations it has been estimated that about 
half of all american children between 3 and 5 watch the show 
bob mcgrath an actor on the program returned a telephone call 
to the associated press but said he and other cast members had been 
asked by hensons family not to speak with the news media he 
referred questions to ctw 
in the beginning henson certainly was the key figure in 
developing characters and their style but over 20 years theyve 
grown and matured so theres a team there now said dr milton 
chin director of instructional television for kqed in san 
francisco and a former researcher for ctw 
theres a lot of talent all around at henson productions 
but theyll be missing the creator he added 
the muppets first regular widespread exposure came when 
sesame street went on the air in 1969 the characters indulge 
in slapstick introduce video clips and live performances and 
participate in skits they have sung with ray charles and played 
tennis with martina navratilova kathleen turner has read them 
bedtime stories and tracy ullman has told them jokes 
the shows muppets have been created assembled and dressed in 
hensons officefactory in manhattan he once denied that they were 
created with any human personality in mind with big bird we knew 
we wanted to do a large a great big character he should represent 
a child so he can make the kinds of mistakes that kids make and 
talk about it and be out front about that so we wanted this large 
kooky creature 
hensons contributions to the show twice won him emmys and made 
stars of these characters 
big bird the yellow 6footer who still manages to see and 
enjoy life like a small fry 
oscar the grouch a beast of indeterminate species who lives in 
a garbage can and complains about the high quality of life on 
sesame street 
bert and ernie humanoid companions who are attached 
respectively to a paper clip collection and a yellow rubber duckie 
the cookie monster a shaggy blue beast who was named for his 
chief weakness 
kermit the frog who appears as a live if bumbling television 
correspondent at the scene of the such fairy tales as the princess 
and the pea and cinderella 
guy smiley americas favorite game show host 
the count an eastern european of noble birth who is obsessed 
with numbers 
henson was the voice and puppeteer for kermit ernie and guy 
smiley and it was hard to see how at least in this capacity he 
could be replaced

mikhail s gorbachev will make his first visit to 
canada as soviet president on may 2930 en route to his summit in 
washington with president bush 
prime minister brian mulroney who invited gorbachev to visit 
canada when the two men met in moscow last year made the 
announcement tuesday in ottawa 
no agenda has been released though gorbachev who visited canada 
as part of a soviet trade delegation in 1983 is expected to spend 
the night in ottawa before heading to washington where bush and 
gorbachev are to meet may 30june 3 
the baltic states drive for independence from moscow will be a 
major topic for discussion while gorbachev is in ottawa mulroney 
said 
its a followup to our discussions in moscow last november 
mulroney said it has been rolled very quickly to the front 
burner and its something on which we would want to have a lengthy 
discussion 
mulroney told reporters outside the house of commons that 
canada like the united states has never recognized the forced 
annexation of the baltic states by the soviet union in 1940 
in a reference to soviet pressure on the baltic states to 
renounce their declarations of independence mulroney also recalled 
he and external affairs minister joe clark were given assurances 
last year that there would be no crackdown 
i suppose you could argue over what a crackdown is but there 
have been some changes in attitudes obviously

members of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade agreed wednesday to grant the soviet union observer status in 
the international trade group a spokesman said 
david woods said the group unanimously approved moscows 
application and soviet officials later attended a meeting of gatts 
top decisionmaking body 
us deputy trade representative rufus yerxa told the meeting a 
soviet presence would increase understanding of centrally planned 
economies and help countries instituting reforms 
it is the sincere hope of my government that the ussr 
will eventually embrace a marketbased price and distribution 
system which could be compatible with gatt norms yerxa said 
but he said discussion of soviet membership in the 96nation 
group was premature 
a text of his speech to the closed meeting was made available to 
journalists 
soviet representatives will be allowed to attend regular 
meetings of gatts decisionmaking council which discusses trade 
disputes and other issues affecting global commerce they will be 
able to speak in debates but will have no voting rights 
washington opposed observer status for the soviets last year 
saying the status should not go into effect until after the 
socalled uruguay round of talks on liberalizing trade practices 
to be held in december 
yerxa said the bush administration agreed to drop this condition 
because nearly all the members of gatt supported giving the soviets 
observer status earlier 
it is too late however for the soviets to participate in the 
uruguay round the talks began in 1986 and their goal is to reach 
comprehensive agreements for free trade in areas such as 
agriculture and textiles 
more than 30 countries have observer status with gatt including 
china which is seeking full membership 
the members of the trade forum account for more than fourfifths 
of global commerce 
also wednesday the ruling body of gatt accepted the findings of 
an arbitration panel that european community taxes on japanese 
electronic components assembled in the ec are illegal 
but european community trade representative tran vanthinh told 
the meeting there were no immediate plans to change ec legislation 
on socalled screwdriver plants that allegedly merely assemble 
components imported from a third country 
the ec canada and the united states are pressing for tougher 
measures to prevent countries from dumping products on a foreign 
market for a lower price than on the home market

there was the drought of 88 torrential 
rains in 89 an early freeze and then this springs deluge 
threatening their cotton and wheat farm finally a suicide pact 
james mcmullen shot his wife billie to death then turned the 
gun on himself sunday night after a weekend of heavy rain 
both were 58 years old 
mrs mcmullen wrote and signed the note they left detailing 
their wishes for funeral services but offering no insight into why 
they decided on suicide said capt marvin melton of the desoto 
parish sheriffs office 
the timing has led some friends to speculate that the flooding 
in their northwestern louisiana community of evelyn was a factor 
friends said mcmullen who suffered a heart attack last year had 
become quieter and more withdrawn recently and that he and his wife 
seemed closer 
but steve schutz hadnt noticed any difference in their behavior 
i guess im one of the few who really hadnt seen a change in 
him schutz said in a telephone interview schutz is red river 
parishs county agent a local representative of the us 
agriculture department 
i was with him friday evening looking at a wheat crop that 
had failed which was an insured crop he had good coverage on the 
crop it was lost to cold wet weather this spring schutz said 
he just needed to go through the insurance procedures and 
then i assumed he was going to go ahead and plant soybeans there 
he said but im the only one i know of who had that impression 
everyone else ive talked to says that when they think back they 
noticed a change 
mcmullens home a restored plantation house sits on a knoll 
overlooking the farm outside of evelyn about 1500 acres of 
tableflat land bordered by bayou pierre a backwater of the red 
river 
the red is out of its banks sweeping over 200 square miles of 
louisiana farmland and bayou pierre had no place to go except over 
mcmullens land and other nearby farms some 240 miles northwest of 
new orleans 
the mcmullens are survived by a son another son died about 
20years ago in a farming accident when he was 5 
buddy johnson also a farmer knew mcmullen well and said he 
understands why his friend took his life 
farming is not just a business its a lifestyle its your 
whole life johnson said if youve got high hopes and all of 
that is suddenly taken away from you what have you got to live 
for 
it costs about 300 an acre to produce a cotton crop and 
mcmullen already had reseeded his land once this spring after rains 
buried his work in mud 
schutz said he believed mcmullen was back in decent financial 
shape after a couple of really rough years at least three 
generations of mcmullens family were farmers and mcmullen farmed 
in northeastern louisiana before moving to evelyn more than 20 
years ago 
i think he had turned the corner he maybe wasnt very far 
from the corner but it appeared to me that he had made it he 
said to me that he was able to get financing on such a large 
operation indicated that the banks had faith in him a lot of 
people couldnt get financing 
as schutz and mcmullen wound up their visit on friday rain 
began to fall eight inches of rain fell on saturday and flood 
water roared down the red river from arkansas and texas on sunday 
about 36 hours after their visit mcmullen and his wife were dead 
my pastor called me at home after church and told me about it 
i was shocked schutz said

energy had a face it was slackjawed with a 
broken nose and crooked smile and versatility had a name it was 
sammy davis jr 
he was a spunky little treasure of raw talent whose battle with 
cancer had been as fierce as the battles he fought throughout his 
60year career 
davis who measured a mere 5foot6 and weighed not much more 
than a jockey died wednesday at 64 he was the last working 
vestige of oldtime vaudeville as well as entertainments 
renaissance man davis did it all and then some singer dancer 
impressionist actor comic 
i love working he once said i know ill have a lot of 
time to rest and read my scrapbooks you never know when the public 
gets tired of you theyre fickle you never know when it can 
happen the average life of a performer is four five years for me 
its been unusual 
but despite the money the glamour the accolades the fame the 
celebrity it was also rough real rough for a oneeyed black 
jewish guy 
from the time he put on his first pair of tap shoes as a baby in 
harlem to his death sammy davis jr always seemed to be proving 
something always seemed to be looking for acceptance and trying to 
win over his detractors 
he entered show business at a time when black people were called 
colored and danced buggedeyed with white paint on his face 
because white producers wanted it that way and though he was 
everyones little darling he lived in segregated hotels and ate in 
segregated restaurants 
he danced his way into the army during world war ii and 
responded to prejudice with his fists his nose was broken in a 
fight with a white soldier others painted him white to remind him 
that he wasnt and gave him a beer bottle filled with urine 
he performed at army bases around the country while in special 
services giving an extra surge of energy the minute he sensed 
anyone in the audience who hated blacks he said in his 
autobiography yes i can that he had to neutralize them 
and force them to acknowledge him 
years later associates said that one reason davis continued to 
perform with such gusto and go that extra mile was an attempt to 
make the world love him 
after the war his highenergy flashdancing and impressions of 
bing crosby frank sinatra and humphrey bogart made his popularity 
soar it was a time when blacks were called negroes and negroes 
werent supposed to mimic whites but davis did 
negroes also werent supposed to date whites but davis did 
despite death threats during his friendship with actress kim novak 
and stares and taunts during his marriage to swedish actress mai 
britt 
after a racial demonstration outside a london theater where he 
was performing in 1960 he spoke to reporters with tears in his 
eyes this is little london england not the niggerhating 
south he said i cannot get over it i really cannot 
but he kept on dancing and he kept on singing and acting and 
entertaining with verve and strength with conviction 
when he was 30 he told the associated press talent is 
something you either have or dont have but the next most 
important thing is honesty you have to play fair with your 
audience you have to give them everything thats in you 
everytime you go out there or theyll spot you for a phony and 
once audiences think youre a phony you cant last long 
davis dived into his work with a vengeance in 1966 while he 
performed nightly at the majestic theater on broadway in golden 
boy he spent his days filming the movie a man called adam 
and his weekends shooting his tv series the sammy davis jr 
show 
the pace eventually led to exhaustion and he had to take a rest 
but not for long sammy can never quite relax a friend once 
said he has to be doing something all the time 
when black became beautiful davis became one of the gang the 
rat pack that bon vivant group of highflying celebrities he was 
chastised by other blacks for being a token 
no matter these were his buddies and he had known sinatra 
since meeting him in the early 40s while touring with his father 
and uncle as the will mastin trio for davis being a 
ratpacker was a heady experience 
during the past decade davis popularity diminished a victim 
of his problems with alcohol and hard living and of an apathetic 
audience that had moved on to other things 
still little flickers of his energy remained he tapped his 
heart out and taught the very talented gregory hines a thing or two 
in the 1989 movie tap this despite an artificial hip davis 
had received in 1988 
after a while you cant keep playing don quixote davis 
said in a 1986 interview you cant keep fighting windmills

tracey ullman the versatile comedian who 
helped launch fox broadcasting co and won the fledgling network 
its first emmy announced wednesday she was quitting four years 
into a fiveyear contract 
i have decided not to go on with the tracey ullman show 
after four seasons in which i was constantly challenged and happily 
tortured by a unique group of people miss ullman said in a 
statement released by fox 
i thank fox for letting somebody no one ever heard of do a 
show on a network that didnt exist 
miss ullmans departure comes two days after her friend and 
executive producer james l brooks announced he was leaving fox to 
sign a deal with columbia pictures television 
miss ullmans personal style of comedy mixed a closetfull of 
personalities with offbeat humor and earned the alternative network 
four emmys and twenty nominations 
although critically acclaimed the saturday night show featuring 
comedic and musical sketches never did well in the ratings often 
finishing last in the nielsens race the final show has been 
completed and is scheduled for broadcast on may 26 
we are grateful to every one of the extraordinary group who so 
painstakingly built each segment of the 81 episodes of the tracey 
ullman show fox chairman barry diller said in a prepared 
statement 
miss ullman leaves fox four years into a fiveyear contract i 
think it was probably mutually agreed upon said fox spokeswoman 
antonia coffman reruns of the tracey ullman show will be shown 
exclusively on the lifetime cable channel beginning in september 
she said 
despite poor ratings the program had built a cult following of 
dedicated viewers 
the british comedians seemingly endless array of characters and 
accents helped make her one of the bestknown new performers in 
this country 
miss ullman costars with kevin kline in the recently released 
theatrical film i love you to death and is currently in new 
york rehearsing for a summer run of the taming of the shrew in

draft registration is a relic of the cold war 
and should end an oregon congressman said wednesday 
you can even buy pieces of the berlin wall in discount stores 
meanwhile the selective service system continues as if nothing 
happened that doesnt make sense rep peter defazio said in an 
interview 
defazio a democrat introduced a house bill that would 
eliminate the presidents authority to mandate registration 
effective nov 30 sen mark hatfield rore is expected to 
introduce a similiar measure in the senate 
the rationale for registering 18yearold men has been 
eliminated by the wave of democracy spreading through the soviet 
union and eastern europe defazio said 
the military today is not worried about how to recruit 
mobilize or train people he said they are worried about how 
to make a reduction in force that will be necessary in the coming 
years 
defazio ending the draft would save between 10 million and 16 
million annually 
our national security is best served by a welltrained 
wellequipped and highly motivated reserve force not outdated 
symbols that have little if anything to do with military 
preparedness he said

a tornado that pulverized a path across 
the city smashed cars blew away roofs and drove wooden planks from 
shredded rafters 2 and 3 feet deep into yards 
i thought our house was bad but when you look at this part of 
the neighborhood i dont even know how anybody could survive 
this kathy ackerman said wednesday as she looked over the damage 
the tornado caused late tuesday you have to see it to believe 
it 
one person was killed and eight were injured in stillwater and 
more than 200 homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged a 
tornado also struck near foyil in northeastern oklahoma injuring 
eight people and damaging 10 homes 
gov henry bellmon promised he would seek federal disaster aid 
for the area of mostly brick homes 
it came through those back yards and touched down on top of 
our house said jan van pelt were still digging but at least 
we still have each other and our baby and our puppy 
mrs van pelt standing in her roofless home said her husband 
saw the funnel cloud on the horizon and ordered the family into a 
bathroom it was one of the few rooms left standing wednesday 
its hard to believe she said i dont think the full 
impact has hit me i havent sat down and cried yet 
police and a national guard unit cordoned off one square mile of 
the most heavily damaged homes and businesses in stillwater only 
residents authorities and the media were allowed into the areas 
police lt kirk mittelstet said some looting had been reported 
a lot of people have come up and told us their apartments or 
houses were stripped mittelstet said we have no idea yet on 
the extent of it we have the streets blocked off so it mostly was 
what they could carry 
next door to mrs van pelts home trey mccauley picked through 
the wreckage of his residence mccauley a student at oklahoma 
state said he had heard the sirens and fled to shelters on campus 
when he returned he couldnt believe what he found 
i heard it was bad i didnt know it was this bad he said 
troopers of insurance adjusters began arriving late wednesday 
morning to survey damage 
clem santine who heads the disaster team for state farm 
insurance said damage would be difficult to assess 
a lot of these houses are total losses he said theyre 
probably looking at bulldozing and starting over 
santine estimated the cost of most of the homes at between 
45000 and 60000 
some of the worst damage was caused by debris from neighboring 
homes 
dennis davis home was smashed by a large section of a roof that 
blew onto his property from across the street 
i felt my house shimmy i could hear the rain and the wind 
then it sounded like an explosion he said 
firefighters say it could be two days before all electricity is 
restored in the neighborhood

imported fruits and vegetables are likely to 
be contaminated by illegal pesticides according to data from the 
food and drug administration released wednesday 
overall 5 percent of the imported produce examined by fda 
inspectors during the last two years contained residue from 
pesticides that are not allowed to be sold to farmers in the united 
states 
the contamination rate may be even higher because fda does not 
screen for all the possible pesticides that are used in foreign 
countries said sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee 
although fda is responsible for inspecting almost all imported 
food it only samples a minuscule 1 percent to 2 percent of the 
food entering this country said leahy the rest is simply 
waived through at the wharf 
leahy requested the fda data he is sponsor of a bill that would 
ban us chemical companies from selling pesticides abroad that are 
outlawed for health reasons here the bill is scheduled for a 
committee vote friday 
leahy called the new data the most compelling reason for 
stopping export of dangerous pesticides 
about 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables eaten by americans 
come from other countries data on domestically grown produce 
showed little or no pesticides residues 
buying food should not be a gamble leahy said consumers 
should not have to choose between offseason cantaloupes and cancer 
every time they buy imported fruit at the supermarket checkout 
line 
here is the extent by percentage to which 12 tested fruits and 
vegetables were found to be contaminated based on inspections 
between oct 1 1988 and april 13 1990 peas 103 eggplant 94 
cabbage 89 pears 8 peppers 74 squash 45 carrots 23 
broccoli 17 tangerines 71 okra 72 blackberries 89

a bipartisan group of congressmen introduced 
legislation wednesday to correct what they called medigap insurance 
industry practices that range from deceitful to fraudulent 
the group said insurance companies were pressuring millions of 
elderly people into wasting meager resources by duplicating health 
coverage 
many senior citizens are frightened to death of the extreme 
high costs of health care and are terribly vulnerable to being 
exploited said sen donald riegle dmich they end up 
spending unconscionable sums of money on policies they dont need 
its time to put a stop to that 
medigap insurance covers health care costs not included under 
medicare the federal health insurance program for the elderly 
riegle said part of the problem was sharp increases in medigap 
insurance rates since congress repealed the catastrophic health 
insurance program last year 
the proposed legislation drew quick opposition from the health 
insurance industry which said the lawmakers were exaggerating the 
problem of duplicative medigap coverage 
if just one person buys insurance they do not need thats one 
too many but we do not believe its a widespread problem said 
don white spokesman for the health insurance association of 
america 
he said an industry survey last year found that 15 percent of 
senior citizens with supplemental medicare policies had more than 
one private insurance policy in addition to medicare

jerusalem mayor teddy kollek said wednesday he 
was deeply offended by an article by new yorks cardinal john 
oconnor condemning a jewish settlement in the christian quarter of 
jerusalems old city 
there is no question that the action of the jewish settlers 
was political but i feel more and more strongly that politics is 
equally the motive behind a good deal of the reaction kollek 
wrote in a letter to oconnor 
beyond the onesidedness of your article the mayor said 
i am personally deeply offended 
oconnor spoke with kollek about the move and on thursday wrote 
in the weekly archdiocesan newspaper catholic new york i trust 
his sincerity when he tells me he does not believe that the 
incident in jerusalem is part of a massive land grab or other 
antichristian policy planned by the government 
but he added i have no way of knowing whether his opinion is 
right or wrong 
in a letter released by kolleks office wednesday the mayor 
said he assured oconnor the incident was not in any way part of 
an antichristian policy of the israeli government 
kollek who strongly opposed the settlement said he believed 
christian leaders have overreacted because of a conspiracy 
syndrome caused by pressure from moslem and palestinian activists 
what surprised me he wrote is that you chose to 
subscribe to this conspiracy syndrome which will surely not help in 
our efforts to reinstate the understanding and harmony that have 
characterized relations between jews and christians in jerusalem 
throughout the years 
on april 11 about 150 jewish settlers moved into an old city 
complex owned by the greek orthodox church sparking angry protests 
by christian and moslem arabs 
religious leaders in the holy land temporarily closed christian 
holy sites to protest the move the israeli supreme court has since 
evicted most of the settlers 
about 20 caretakers remain in the building pending a decision on 
a property dispute in which the greek church claims a former tenant 
illegally sold his leasing rights to the settlers 
the israeli government admitted it contributed 18 million to 
fund the controversial settlement

britains unelected house of lords is preparing to 
kill government legislation to allow trials of suspected nazi war 
criminals 
it would be the first time in modern history that the lords 
mostly hereditary aristocrats have rejected outright a bill passed 
by the elected house of commons 
nazi hunters are distressed but some in the lords argue that 
fair trials are impossible at a distance of up to 50 years that 
the crimes were not committed on british soil and that retroactive 
legislation is unjust 
the expected rejection of the bill in a lords vote on june 4 
has revived qualms about the powers still vested in this unique 
collection of bluebloods bishops jurists and recently ennobled 
politicians all of whom owe their place in the upper chamber to 
birth or political patronage 
however prime minister margaret thatchers government seems 
quietly relieved at the prospect of avoiding what critics call 
show trials of three aging east european emigres 
officials have said in unattributable briefings that if the 
lords reject the war crimes bill at its most important legislative 
stage the second reading the conservative government will abandon 
it 
i think the government will be only too pleased lord 
ponsonby 59 chief whip for the opposition labor party said in an 
interview 
but it disturbs me added ponsonby who inherited his 
fathers title in 1976 i have always held that the nonelected 
house has no right to thwart the will of the elected house 
the lords power to kill legislation has gradually diminished 
this century and today they can do no more than delay bills for up 
to a year 
the government could in theory reintroduce the bill in the 
commons after the new session of parliament opens in november if 
commons again passed the bill the lords could not reject it in its 
entirity 
however the government is not expected to take that action 
because officials have privately said they will drop the measure if 
the lords kill it 
the commons adopted the war crimes bill 348123 in december 
mrs thatcher voted in favor 
dropping the bill would make britain the only world war ii ally 
to take no action against suspected war criminals on its soil 
australia and canada are holding their first trials and the 
united states deports suspects for trial in israel including john 
demjanjuk whose appeal of a death sentence began this week 
in a first shot the lords on may 1 defeated 13762 a separate 
government measure to allow scottish courts to accept videotaped 
evidence in war crimes trials 
the only suspect repeatedly identified in the british media 
antanas gecas 73 a lithuanianborn mining engineer lives in 
scotland 
he belonged to a notorious lithuanian police battalion and says 
he witnessed atrocities but never participated in them he is suing 
the times of london for libel 
among the active members of the lords about 350 out of 1178 
life peers predominate many of them heavyweight lawyers and top 
judges 
lord campbell of alloway a 73yearold lawyer conservative 
life peer and wartime prisoner of the germans says there is no 
reasonable assumption of a fair trial and no appropriate 
punishment 
supporters of the bill point to the enormity of the crimes and 
say war criminals lied their way to safety and citizenship in 
britain 
why should britain act differently from australia canada 
france holland and even germany itself conservative lawmaker 
john marshall wrote to the times 
the commons vote followed a governmentordered inquiry into 
names submitted by the nazihunting simon wiesenthal center 
the commission saw sufficient evidence to prosecute three 
suspects and investigate 124 others and warned that to do nothing 
would taint britain as a safe haven for criminals 
they the lords say old men cannot stand trial but they are 
competent to pass laws said the dean of the los angelesbased 
center rabbi marvin hier its a contradiction 
conservative richard shepherd said that despite the commons 
majority for the bill many legislators are uneasy about mounting 
the trials 
although it has a conservative majority the upper house has 
consistently troubled mrs thatcher by amending controversial 
legislation 
but this is the first bill since 1949 that the lords are 
threatening to throw out wholesale according to the lords 
information office

government and airline officials said they 
were considering new tactics for protecting us travelers in 
response wednesday to a highly critical report on aviation 
terrorism 
the report by a presidential commission said us aviation 
security is seriously flawed and called for preemptive and 
retaliatory miltary strikes against statesponsored terrorists 
that proposal brought no immediate response from the white house 
or state department 
but the inquiry into the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 
103 produced scores of nutsandbolts recommendations which 
transportation and state department officials as well as airline 
representatives said they are considering 
the commission on aviation security and terrorism issued its 
final report tuesday on its investigation of the bombing that 
killed all 259 people aboard the boeing 747 and 11 residents of 
lockerbie scotland where the plane fell 
the proposals covered reforms in the federal aviation 
administration changes in state department policies new laws to 
require more vigilance by airlines and a warning system to give 
passengers the option of canceling passage on flights that have 
been threatened 
the air transport association which represents major airlines 
called together airline security officials for a thursday meeting 
in washington to discuss how some of the proposals might be carried 
out 
spokesman tim neill said the group would assess which proposals 
might pose difficulties and try to find ways to implement some of 
them without faa action 
one recommendation which might create problems is a call for 
airlines to take primary responsiblity for the security of mail and 
other cargo neill said much of the cargo arrives shrinkwrapped 
or sealed in containers he said 
the state department issued a statement wednesday saying 
officials were studying the best way to implement the 
recommendations that apply to this department 
ivan selin undersecretary of state for management was 
appointed to set up a task force to review the proposals said 
spokesman richard boucher 
the department already has taken steps to deal better with 
crises such as airliner bombings including some recommended by the 
commission victims relatives had complained of government 
insensitivity after the lockerbie bombing 
faa administrator james busey said he dispatched a team tuesday 
to work with the commission to decide which of its recommendations 
could be followed 
busey said he would go ahead with plans to install sophisticated 
bomb detectors in six airports but would await the results of 
studies of the systems before pursuing an order that airlines 
install scores more 
the commission asked the faa to hold off on widespread 
installation saying the thermal neutron analysis units likely 
would not have detected the flight 103 bomb 
among panel recommendations that officials are expected to 
consider are 
more aggressive efforts to protect american passengers abroad 
including the appointment of a special ambassador for internatonal 
aviation security 
phasein of antiterrorist measures at us airports with the 
appointment of federal security coordinators at key terminals 
passage of laws to require criminal records checks of all 
airport employees to impose additional fines against airlines that 
endanger passengers lives with lax security and to provide 
financial payments to victims of terrorist acts 
increased training for airport and airline security personnel 
more scrutiny of mail and cargo carried aboard airliners 
stronger security measures for checked luggage and for people 
with access to airliners 
reorganizaton of the faa to give security operations higher 
status 
more research and development of devices to detect the most 
sophisticated terrorist bombs and of ways to reinforce airliners 
against damage from small explosions 
establishment of a system for letting passengers know when an 
airliner has received a credible bomb threat 
more humane procedures for dealing with victims of foreign 
terrorism and their family members

the justice department on wednesday sought to 
narrow the scope of a court order barring drug testing for 
attorneys seeking jobs in the departments antitrust division 
us district judge gerhard gesell said tuesday that in the 
absence of a reasonable suspicion of drug use such testing 
violates the constitutional right of citizens not to be searched 
without cause and under a warrant 
gesells ruling came in a lawsuit by a private attorney carl 
willner who applied for a job in the division 
the decision should apply only to willner not to all applicants 
for attorney positions the department said in court papers 
the scope of this injunction is beyond the courts subject 
matter jurisdiction said the justice department motion to modify 
the court order 
gesell said willner lacked standing to challenge all 
preemployment drug testing at the department and its various 
components 
it follows that willner likewise lacks standing to challenge 
preemployment testing of all new employees in the antitrust 
division said the justice department brief

president bush on wednesday accused congress 
of risking the hopes of freedom in nicaragua and panama by 
failing to quickly pass an emergency aid bill and said lawmakers 
should not leave for their memorial day recess before acting 
however he said he would not sign a bill including 
mischievous language providing abortion money for washington 
dc as one current version does 
several democrats suggested the delay wasnt their fault and 
one accused bush of a taking a cheap shot at them to divert 
attention from bigger problems such as dealing with the economy 
the president said he has exhausted all administrative avenues 
for providing aid to the threeweek old government of nicaraguas 
president violeta chamorro and cannot legally grant her request for 
an emergency 40 million loan the treasury department cannot make 
such loans without assurance nicaragua would get us aid or other 
revenues to pay it back 
bush renewed his plea for congressional movement on his proposal 
for 300 million for nicaragua and 500 million for the new 
proamerican government of panama 
we must not let the procedural gridlock in congress destroy 
the hopes of freedom in these two fledgling democracies the 
president said 
bush added however that he will veto any aid package that 
reaches his desk with language that approves federal money for 
abortions in the district of columbia 
he blasted congress for piling on that and other amendments 
that have absolutely nothing to do with nicaragua and panama 
the american people are frustrated by the inability of 
congress to do business in a prompt and orderly fashion said 
bush 
on capitol hill however rep david bonior dmich said that 
nobody is screaming in my district about aid to nicaragua and 
panama instead he said they are talking about education health 
care the budget deficit and other domestic issues 
rep david obey dwis said bush was merely taking a cheap 
shot at congress in order to take attention away from bigger 
problems 
the house he said has followed its rules only to be thrown 
off course by republicans in the house and senate 
democrats indicated it was unlikely the money bill would be 
passed before the end of next week when congress is scheduled to 
begin its memorial day recess 
republican whip newt gingrich of georgia retorted that the 
democrats were guilty of destructively irresponsible actions 
that the two nations were being jeopardized by petty 
congressional games 
the nicaraguapanama aid package is tangled in a legislative 
knot 
first the house must pass an authorization bill to spend the 
money that bill which has already passed the senate will be 
taken up by the house on monday it includes a democratdriven 
proposal to hold back military aid for el salvador in 1990 and 1991 
in an effort to promote peace negotiations in that wartorn central 
american country 
at the same time housesenate negotiators met wednesday 
afternoon to deal with the appropriations bill which has billions 
of dollars of domestic projects attached to it they didnt finish 
work on the measure 
bush first requested the panama aid in january and added the 
nicaragua request following mrs chamorros election on feb 25 
with addon amendments he said the bill has tripled in size 
the president said he wanted passage of a bill this week or 
early next week and failing that i will call on the congress to 
remain in session until it completes action on a bill i can sign 
the situation in nicaragua is critical bush said mrs 
chamorros government is absolutely bankrupt 
bush said he had even asked his aides to look into whether the 
government could encourage private lending to help the new 
nicaraguan government through its economic crisis but that such 
lenders would run into the same type of collateral problem the us 
government has 
mrs chamorro sent bush a may 11 cable requesting a 40 million 
bridge loan to enable her to get through the immediate financial 
crisis 
she said the sandinista government that preceded her had run the 
treasury dry and left reserves that will not get the country 
through the next month 
she is beset by a paralyzing prosandinista strike by government 
workers nationwide 
striking public employees have occupied public buildings phone 
service has been interrupted and other public utilities and 
services impeded by the strike 
officially the strikers want a 200 percent pay raise a 
subsidized food package rehiring of a labor leader fired monday 
and the demobilization of the contra rebels 
in the nicaragua aid package that the administration is seeking 
30 million would be earmarked for humanitarian aid and 
resettlement of the contras who are stationed in five temporary 
encampments within nicaragua while they disarm and resettle 
organization of american states officials who are distributing 
food to the contras say the contras will be out of food by the 
weekend 
some administration officials have said that could unravel the 
whole peace process that brought the rebels to the camps because 
they still have their weapons and might leave the security zones 
and get into conflict with sandinista soldiers

the united states and arab countries have been 
unable to negotiate a mutually acceptable un security council 
resolution criticizing israeli settlements in occupied territories 
as a violation of international law us officials said wednesday 
the arab countries have temporarily abandoned their effort to 
draft such a resolution partly because the negotiations were 
unsuccessful said the officials who commented on condition of 
anonymity 
israel has protested the joint usarab effort 
officially the state department said only that it would 
withhold comment on the subject until it sees a final text of any 
arab resolution 
the arab nations were hoping to come up with a resolution that 
would both criticize israel and not be vetoed by the united states 
they are concerned about the increasing flow of soviet jewish 
refugees to israel and the prospect that large numbers would be 
resettled in territory seized by israel in the 1967 war 
this would make more difficult the fulfillment of the arab goal 
of establishing a palestinian state in those areas 
but israel has said that only a tiny fraction of the refugees 
have been resettled in either the west bank or gaza strip or in 
east jerusalem 
the state department has generally sided with the arab position 
that soviet jews not be settled in the occupied territories 
officials have said that a request for a 400 million us loan 
guarantee to house the soviet emigres would be jeopardized if 
soviet jews are resettled in these areas 
the administration has expressed opposition to all settlement 
activities in the territories but it has stopped short of saying 
they are illegal 
israel believed that the united states by trying to cooperate 
with the arab countries on the issue was going along with what it 
described as an arab effort to block the flow of soviet jews to 
israel 
the settlement issue is one of several on which the united 
states and israel have been in disagreement but the bush 
administration maintains that it continues to view israel as a 
close ally

mutinous soldiers abandoned their 
ninehour siege of the capitals international airport on wednesday

president bush heard advocates and critics of 
a civil rights bill agree wednesday that women who suffer job 
discrimination deserve the same right to damages as minorities 
bush held two more meetings with a wide range of interest groups 
as he pressed for a compromise to avoid an embarrassing veto of the 
measure which would reverse six 1989 supreme court rulings that 
narrowed protection against bias in the workplace 
were in the listening stage here with reasonably open 
minds bush said as he sat down with representatives of womens 
groups the disabled and others 
he held a separate session with hispanic leaders and met monday 
with black civil rights advocates 
were working hard to get an agreement bush said at a 
midday news conference i hope we can narrow the differences 
enough so that we can go forward together on this legislation 
attorney general dick thornburgh said last month that he might 
recommend a veto of the kennedyhawkins bill because it smacks of 
quotas 
bush has supported his own legislation to undo two of the six 
high court rulings but he has not agreed to support damages for 
those who suffer discrimination based on sex and religion the law 
already entitles minorities and ethnic group members to damages in 
such instances 
but even conservative activists who fear that the 
kennedyhawkins bill would force employers to resort to quotas 
support damages for women and religious group members 
the issue that we all seem to be very much in support of even 
our colleagues from different standpoints was that we want 
damages said anne bryant executive director american 
association of university women 
linda dorian executive director of business and professional 
women usa said the law also needs to give some finality to 
consent decrees that have resulted in a lot of gains for women 
and minorities 
a supreme court ruling has reopened cases previously settled by 
consent decrees 
mark liedel director of special projects for the heritage 
foundation castigated the kennedyhawkins bill saying it would 
create a quota system but he added there is a need to put 
damages into title vii of the civil rights act 
carey stacy president of the national association of women 
business owners said the civil rights of employers may be in 
jeopardy we would go around being guilty until proven 
innocent 
judy golub of the american jewish committee said we are 
convinced that nothing in this act creates or condones quotas 
the civil rights bill named after chief sponsors sen edward 
kennedy dmass and rep augustus hawkins dcalif has not 
passed either the house or senate

little has changed in blighted liberty city in the 
decade since three days of bloody race rioting left 18 people dead 
except perhaps things have gotten worse 
expectations that stark social problems highlighted by the riots 
would be remedied have dwindled as few concrete changes 
materialized 
mayor xavier suarez elected in 1985 agreed relief efforts have 
been slow in coming apparently at the time there was a lot of 
promising going on he said 
typifying liberty city dilemmas is that of darnell rudolph and 
leroy taylor who sell hubcaps and used appliances from a scarred 
liberty city street corner they say local authorities have been 
little help 
on every corner they got cocaine but they dont want nobody 
selling hubcaps said leroy taylor brother of rudolph and uncle 
of darnell they stop us but they cant stop the cocaine boys 
their complaints echo those of others who lament the lack of 
progress made since liberty city and other innercity miami 
neighborhoods exploded on may 17 1980 after five white police 
officers were acquitted in the beating death of black insurance 
executive arthur mcduffie 
the taylors 6monthold business consists of about 20 stacks of 
hubcaps set in from a neat row of tires the men say they make 
about 25 a day 
we are freemarket entrepreneurs said rudolph taylor 54 
who is disabled and holds a county peddlers license but an 
inspector recently told the trio their business violated county 
codes and ordered them to move 
the taylors say they have no money to start up a permanent 
business or to afford insurance licenses and other costs they 
are not alone 
a 1989 dade county report summarized the causes of the 1980 riot 
and three other violent civil disturbances later in the decade as 
lack of economic opportunity and economic and political power 
lack of concern on the part of civic leaders housing problems 
unemployment policecommunity relations and the criminal justice 
system in general 
in december 1979 mcduffie led police on a chase after running a 
stop sign on his motorcycle when they caught him they battered 
him with nightsticks and heavy flashlights one of the officers 
testified at the trial moved to tampa because of publicity 
mcduffie spent four days in a coma then died the five 
metrodade officers were acquitted by an allwhite jury 
i just didnt see how these people could get away like that 
when they just brutally murdered him said his brother lewis 
mcduffie 
the rioting that ensued left 18 dead 270 wounded and caused at 
least 100 million in property damage 
police sgt wayne knowles a 19yearveteran of the force who 
grew up near liberty city said he saw terrible things while 
battling rioters things have gotten worse he said 
the availability of highpowered weapons is a growing problem 
as is crack cocaine addicts steal everything that can be sold as 
scrap from vacant houses making them irreparable knowles said 
often the homes become crack houses 
educator marvin dunn author of a book on the mcduffie riot and 
its aftermath said government has been slow or ineffective in 
improving liberty city but he praised the private sector for its 
contribution to rebuilding efforts 
these people raised 7 million out of their own pockets and 
they get very little recognition for it he said its not that 
what they did made that much difference but it did say to the 
black community we havent given up on you 
dunn estimates 35 million in federal state and private funds 
was spent in the area after the 1980 riot 
millions of it got squandered away in socalled training 
programs for new business leaders and just all kinds of exotic 
things that didnt translate into bricks and mortar in that 
community 
meanwhile under the rusty old lights that once illuminated a 
grocery parking lot the taylors sell an occasional hubcap and 
hope they can stay in business 
if i dont have a job ill try to make my own job darnell 
said we do the best we can

lithuanias parliament offered wednesday 
to suspend laws it has enacted since declaring the republics 
independence if the kremlin agrees to negotiate 
the resolution adopted by the lithuanian supreme council aimed 
at breaking lithuanias impasse with moscow but parliament 
spokeswoman rita dapkus said it did not involve rescinding the 
republics march 11 declaration of independence as the kremlin has 
demanded 
the offer will be delivered to president mikhail s gorbachev on 
thursday she said 
ms dapkus said the proposal closely resembled the compromise 
suggested last month by french and german leaders but adds a 
transition period before full independence and concrete proposals 
on military cooperation economic plans and other topics 
gorbachev spokesman arkady maslennikov has said the proposal by 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois 
mitterrand went along the lines of gorbachevs thinking but 
stopped short of calling it acceptable 
gorbachev pronounced lithuanias declaration of independence 
invalid in march and followed up with economic sanctions including 
a partial blockade that officials say has left the republic of 38 
million on the verge of running out of fuel 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said tuesday she 
believed talks with moscow could begin as early as this week 
a leader of neighboring latvia said wednesday that talks on 
baltic independence would start next week with midlevel kremlin 
officials estonias premier edgar savisaar appealed wednesday for 
us help to smooth the way 
latvian deputy prime minister ilmars bisers just back from 
meetings in moscow said talks with soviet officials would focus on 
the gaining of independence on the basis of a treaty with the 
soviet union 
savisaar also appealed to us secretary of state james a baker 
iii to discuss the baltic republics drive for independence in his 
meetings this week with soviet leaders in moscow the estonian news 
agency eta said 
all three baltic republics were reported to be calm wednesday 
one day after thousands of antiindependence protesters converged 
on government buildings in riga the capital of latvia and 
tallinn the capital of estonia 
in moscow baker said he would press soviet leaders to explain 
why they have not begun talks with baltic leaders 
its not encouraging to us to see the absence of a dialogue 
between leaders there and the kremlin baker said 
in washington president bush said the standoff between moscow 
and the baltic republics certainly puts some tension on his may 
30june 3 summit 
gorbachev has offered latvia and estonia special status in a 
revamped soviet federation in late april they chose instead to 
pursue their drives for gradual but full independence 
estonia latvia and lithuania were independent states before 
they were forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 their open 
defiance of moscow has stirred activists in other republics 
including russia to begin talking about starting their own open 
campaigns for independence from the soviet union a federation of 
15 republics 
about 100 volunteer guards surrounded the parliament building in 
riga on wednesday 
in tallinn more than 2000 men signed up for an unarmed home 
guard to protect key government buildings and communications 
lines eta reported 
the guard was formed under a new government decree prompted by 
what savisaar called a failed coup attempt on tuesday when a 
crowd of several thousand protesters tried to occupy tallinns 
government building 
a similar confrontation occurred tuesday in riga where for the 
second day whistling and jeering soviet soldiers tried to muscle 
into the latvian parliament building but were blocked by 
proindependence crowds 
the estonian antiindependence protesters have threatened a 
general strike may 21 unless their demands are met by thursday 
according to interfax a news service of official radio moscow 
they want the immediate resignation of the republics government 
and a referendum on estonias campaign to secede from the soviet 
union 
savisaar also told baker in a telegram about tuesdays attempts 
by moscow loyalists to occupy estonian government buildings 
reported the estonian independent a proindependence newspaper 
savisaar told baker the estonian government would be deeply 
surprised were the incidents in estonia and latvia not to find 
reverberation in his talks with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
it was unclear whether the antiindependence protests in estonia 
and latvia were coordinated from moscow or organized by soviet 
loyalists in the republics

civil libertarians on wednesday attacked a 
bush administration plan to allow federal law enforcement agencies 
greater authority to seize the assets of accused criminals 
the proposed legislation would allow the seizure of the gross 
receipts gained from a wide variety of crimes before a defendant 
was convicted the crimes include mail and wire fraud procurement 
fraud computer fraud and credit card fraud 
isnt this contrary to our principle of presumption of 
innocence rep don edwards dcalif asked attorney general 
dick thornburgh during a house judiciary committee hearing 
edwards a civil liberties advocate chairs the panels 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights he noted that 
congress already had authorized asset seizures for accused drug 
traffickers 
but this pretrial seizure of property was supposed to be an 
extraordinary remedy dictated by the unique nature of the drug 
cases he said 
thornbugh said he didnt believe the asset forfeiture violated a 
defendants presumption of innocence he noted that the supreme 
court recently upheld such seizures in racketeering cases 
thornburgh noted also that congress recently authorized similar 
seizures of the fruits of alleged savings and loan fraud in 
addition to drug trafficking and racketeering 
whitecollar criminals drug traffickers organized crime 
chieftains are all committing criminal acts for one purpose only 
to make money thornburgh said to the extent we can neutralize 
their ability to make money through their illegal activities we 
are serving i believe the public interest 
edwards responded the problem in your response is that you 
say illegal activities these these people are innocent until 
proven guilty under our american system 
its a sad thing when the justice department is proposing this 
kind of institutional injustice where the police can seize your 
property and stick out their tongues at you said arthur spitzer 
an attorney for the american civil liberties union 
its done too often on too low a standard of proof and without 
adequate procedures so the person is presumed guilty until he 
proves himself innocent and often doesnt have an opportunity to 
prove himself innocent 
the bill would extend to a new set of crimes the assetseizure 
provisions in crime laws enacted by congress in 1984 and 1986 
as a result of such legislation the justice departments asset 
forfeiture fund has grown from 272 million collected in 1985 to 
580 million that was seized in the 1989 fiscal year 
the measure would allow the us postal service and the treasury 
department to initiate administrative forfeiture proceedings 
arising from mail fraud credit card fraud and violation of customs 
statutes

president bush said wednesday he plans no 
further sanctions against china although the administration retains 
serious concerns about violations of human rights there 
even though beijing has made a number of limited positive 
steps since the united states imposed sanctions against the 
chinese government last year the effect of the positive steps 
has been diluted and in some cases negated by new restrictive 
measures bush said in a report to congress on uschina 
relations 
still he wrote the united states should continue dialogue with 
china and flexible application of existing us policy steps 
could help us to restore a sounder basis for relations with china 
in the years ahead 
we continue to have serious concerns about the human rights 
situation in china where he said little has changed since the 
violent suppression of prodemocracy movement last june 
while the most overt forms of repression army patrols and 
arrests have diminished this is largely due to a climate of 
intimidation that inhibits open dissent bushs report said we 
are prepared to take further steps should conditions in china so 
warrant but for the moment we regard the existing level of 
suspensions as appropriate 
restrictive measures imposed by beijing he said in the report 
include a new regulation requiring university graduates to work for 
five years before being permitted to study abroad 
other regressive steps mentioned were government control of the 
media arts trade unions and nongovernmental organizations 
heavyhanded surveillance and harassment of foreign journalists 
imprisonment of political prisoners and dissidents including 
several hundred in tibet continued detention of a few thousand 
participants in last junes prodemocracy uprisings 
talking briefly about china in a news conference wednesday bush 
said he has not decided whether to extend chinas status as a 
country receiving most favored nation trading status from the 
united states 
bush must decide by june 3 whether to recommend continuation of 
that status which guarantees a country that it will get the best 
us tariffs for its exports that any other country gets 
that issue is under lively discussion bush told 
reporters included in the discussion is consideration of what the 
impact would be on hong kong which is to become part of china in 
1997 bush indicated 
it isnt an easy call because i dont want to send a signal 
that we are happy with the human rights record bush said i 
still am of the mind that having contact and working in area where 
there has been progress on the economic side with china is 
important 
congress in february asked bush to report on the affect of the 
us sanctions imposed on china in the wake of beijings violent 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrations last june 
the report released by the white house on wednesday concluded 
generally that it is difficult to assess precisely what impact 
us and multilateral measures have had on china clearly 
chinas own retrenchment policies not external sanctions have 
been the principal factor behind economic developments in china 
over the past year 
the sanctions included suspension of nuclear and military sales 
and exchanges although the administration has since lifted 
restriction on some exports such as communications equipment that 
are not considered to be of weapons use and suspension of 
guarantees for new investments in china by the overseas private 
investment corp a governmentbacked agency that insures us 
investments abroad 
the president a former us ambassador to china maintains that 
despite his disappointment over chinas policies the worlds most 
populous country has too much geopolitical importance to be 
isolated by the united states 
trade between the united states and china surpassed 18 billion 
last year making china the united states 10th largest trading 
partner he said

an order by the states chief justice 
barring a bonfire of the vanities film crew from a county 
courthouse was challenged in court wednesday by the county and the 
american civil liberties union 
chief justice robert n wilentz acted because he said the script 
called for a scene that showed blacks acting in a riotous 
lawless and lifethreatening manner 
he said the scene could cause black moviegoers to lose faith in 
the justice system the warner bros film crew can use the 
courthouse if the scene is dropped wilentz said 
warner production crews are looking elsewhere for a courthouse 
and are withholding 250000 that essex county would have been paid 
for use of the building 
hes violating the first amendment said county executive 
nicholas amato hes also costing the taxpayers in essex county a 
lot of money and for what 
the movie is based on the tom wolfe novel of the same name about 
a white wall street bond salesman sherman mccoy who is thrust 
into the court system of the bronx after he accidentally kills a 
black youth 
wilentz invoking his authority as chief of the court system in 
new jersey objected to a scene that shows a metal gate being 
slammed in the faces of a black mob after the charges against mccoy 
are dismissed 
a work of fiction as opposed to a documentary can exaggerate 
to make a point said warner publicist rob harris we think 
what the judge has done is unreasonable but were not waiting for 
him to change his mind 
warner is not part of the lawsuit because it cannot wait for it 
to be settled to complete filming the movie scene 
the suit says wilentz is unlawfully seeking to censor 
restrict and regulate the content of the movie in violation of 
first amendment guarantees of freedom of speech 
it asks that wilentz be barred from prohibiting use of the 
courthouse and seeks unspecified compensatory damages 
wilentz had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it 
said state courts spokesman carl golden 
his position hasnt changed though golden said 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
supported wilentz calling it reprehensible for public property 
to be party to perpetuating racist stereotypes 
earlier this month bronx borough president fernando ferrer 
objected to a new york courthouse being used for filming because 
the movie depicts the area as dangerous 
what the scene depicts is rage over the outcome harris 
said the judge seemed to think that that rage could be conveyed 
through two people engaged in dialogue 
if he really thinks that i wouldnt want to see any movie he 
would direct

a tollfree hotline is being set up to tell 
people about federal compensation for people injured by 
vaccinations officials said wednesday

set out in the law 
as of may 11 the program had paid 32 million in 62 cases

injured by vaccines and a group of parents filed a lawsuit aimed 
at forcing federal health officials to generate more publicity for 
the compensation program

chess studios where so much musical history was 
made that the rolling stones once used its address as a song title 
was voted a landmark wednesday by the city council 
the council voted unanimously to honor the twostory brick and 
terra cotta building at 2120 s michigan ave where chuck berry 
muddy waters bo diddley and others made music together over the 
years 
a celebration commemorating the 79yearold building was 
scheduled for june 7 timed in conjunction with the citys annual 
blues festival 
i think its one of the greatest honors bestowed upon us 
phil chess said wednesday in a telephone interview from his tucson 
ariz home i just wish my brother was around to accept the 
honor really but thats life 
chess records was born in 1950 evolving from another label 
owned by brothers leonard and phil chess in 1957 the polish 
immigrants moved their label and studios to michigan avenue across 
the street from the old lexington hotel gangster al capones 
onetime headquarters 
the studio was home to recording sessions that gave american 
music a whole new sound in the 1950s 
berry recorded johnny b goode howlin wolf cut 
spoonful diddley made you cant judge a book by looking at 
the cover and waters recorded im your hoochie coochie man 
chess said radio station program directors were slow to 
broadcast the blues artists but others were listening mostly 
young people 
the urban blues and rock n roll from chess caught on making 
its way across the atlantic and returning transformed by groups 
forming the british invasion of the early 1960s 
the english groups are the ones that had the influence of 
making the pop stations play the blues mainly by white artists 
but later they started playing black artists too chess said 
the rolling stones took their name from waters 1950 record 
rolling stone one of chess first releases in 1964 they 
recorded cuts for their 12 x 5 album at chess including the 
song 2120 south michigan avenue 
chess flourished until 1969 when the family sold the operation 
leonard chess died of a heart attack that fall the chess catalog 
is now owned by mca records 
the building is owned by former chess sessionguitarist gerald 
sims a crooked line of stickon numbers gives the address there 
are two remaining commercial tenants and an office space for 
lease sign is taped to the front window 
but sims has big plans for 2120 
he wants to build a museum on the first floor the studios are 
still operable and were used by rock star john mellencamp last fall 
to record a 90minute performance aimed at promoting the building 
for landmark status 
all musicians need inspiration and we hope that by setting up 
a shrine to some of these great musicians that came through there 
and recorded some of their music there it will inspire some of the 
young people to go on and do great things sims said

a top iranian official on wednesday 
demanded the release of moslems held in israel and lebanon and 
indicated no more western hostages would be freed until there is a 
reciprocal gesture 
iran has intensified its efforts to secure the release of 
hostages in the past months hussein moussavian irans director 
of western european affairs said after meeting officials of the 
european economic community 
we believe that goodwill should be shown against goodwill 
he said 
at a news conference after the threehour meeting at dublin 
castle moussavian said western countries only care about their 
captives and accused the west of racism 
he also adamantly stated that iran will not retract its death 
sentence against indianborn british author salman rushdie 
iran and britain severed diplomatic relations last year after 
irans late spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called 
on moslems to kill rushdie on grounds that his novel the satanic 
verses blasphemes islam 
ireland which holds the rotating presidency of the 12nation 
community made no statement after the meeting 
but the talks appeared to have made no progress toward securing 
freedom for the remaining 16 western hostages despite modest hopes 
raised after iran requested the meeting in the past month iran has 
helped free two of the six americans held by proiranian moslem 
captors in lebanon 
those six americans including the longestheld hostage terry a 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
seven citizens of eec states are also held they include three 
britons a dual british and irish national an italian two west 
germans two swiss red cross workers are being held in lebanon 
asked why iran has not followed up efforts that helped free 
americans robert polhill and frank reed the past month moussavian 
said lebanese groups holding westerners now expect to see moslem 
captives freed 
it is only the expectation of the lebanese groups that the 
other side also makes a gesture and releases hostages said 
moussavian he spoke through an interpreter at the iranian embassy 
this is their expectation that the other side should show 
goodwill and we think they are right he said 
moussavian said israel and christian groups hold hundreds of 
moslem hostages 
moussavian spoke to reporters after meeting the foreign affairs 
political directors of ireland france and italy those countries 
represent the past present and future presidents of the eec 
the meeting marked the communitys first formal talks with iran 
since that country in a move toward improving relations with the 
west appointed an ambassador to the european trade bloc last march 
moussavian sidestepped questions on whether the plight of 
individual hostages was raised 
the feeling has come to us that the western countries are 
racist talking only about their own hostages and they attach no 
value to the iranian and moslem hostages whose numbers are 
tenfold he said 
he reiterated irans demand that the west secure the release of 
four iranians believed seized by christian militiamen in lebanon 
british officials said the four have most likely been killed 
moussavian said irans trade relations with the community were 
good and the only major political problem was the controversy over 
rushdie 
iran is demanding that britain condemn rushdie and ban his 
novel britain says this would contravene freedom of speech 
we should consider a boundary line between freedom and respect 
for the beliefs of people moussavian said unfortunately this 
line and boundary has not been maintained by western countries

six members of an albanian family that took refuge 
in the italian embassy in tirana for 4 years left albanias 
capital wednesday after their government reached an accord with 
rome the foreign ministry said 
italian state television said the asylumseekers were taken in a 
red cross van from the embassy in tirana and driven to the airport 
in its statement the italian foreign ministry said one of its 
officials was accompanying the two brothers and four sisters aged 
57 to 65 on a special flight to rome 
without giving details the statement said the popa family was 
able to leave the embassy following an accord reached between the 
italian and albanian governments thanks also to the intervention 
of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
after arriving in rome from albania perez de cuellar said 
monday the albania government was prepared to resolve the case soon 
the popa family entered the embassy on dec 12 1985 and sought 
political asylum 
their father a pharmacist had been accused of collaborating 
with italian fascist occupiers during world war ii 
the albanian government had long refused to allow the family to 
leave the country but a few weeks ago indicated it would be 
willing to let the six emigrate 
the case turned into a cause celebre in italy where all parties 
in parliament united in urging the rome government last year not to 
surrender the popas 
 
the happy solution of the popa case cannot help but influence 
the future course of italianalbanian relations which in the last 
months had already experienced a positive evolution due to the 
first openings in a democratic sense of the tirana government 
the foreign ministry said in its statement 
in recent months the albanian regime has shown signs of easing 
its rigid isolationist stance

a homeless woman who allegedly abducted her 
daughter from a hospital last week returned the girl wednesday 
despite her fears that the child would undergo heart surgery which 
she opposes for religious reasons 
police said 12yearold kimberly winfield was in good condition 
they said her mother carolyn l winfield 35 a jehovahs witness 
was arrested and charged with one count of felony child abduction 
a bond hearing was set for thursday 
dr d woodrow benson head of cardiology at childrens memorial 
hospital examined kimberly and said her condition had not worsened 
during her absence 
the child who suffers from two weakened heart valves was 
abducted before a scheduled court hearing last thursday on a state 
agencys effort to obtain an order to proceed with the surgery over 
ms winfields objection 
david schneidman of the illinois children and family services 
department said wednesday that while kimberlys heart condition 
was not immediately lifethreatening hospital officials had said 
it was advisable she be treated within a month 
schneidman said the mother and daughter who disappeared early 
on may 11 were spotted wednesday morning at an apartment that 
catholic charities not realizing who she was was trying to help 
her rent 
a neighbor who talked with ms winfield learned that kimberly 
was inside the apartment and contacted catholic charities 
before police arrived however ms winfield decided to 
surrender said schneidman 
schneidman said kimberly and her brothers were in his agencys 
custody because the family was homeless he said the department 
will continue to seek a court order to allow doctors to operate on 
kimberly whose heart problems developed after an attack of 
rheumatic fever when she was 5 
we dont step in simply because religious beliefs dictate 
against medical procedure said schneidman we do step in if a 
child is being abused or neglected here it was obvious they 
needed help 
jehovahs witnesses refuse blood transfusions on religious 
grounds they cite a section of leviticus that reads whatsoever 
man eats any manner of blood i will cut him off from among his

the world attracting an estimated 235 million viewers in 100 
countries his magic touch was evident again this year with his

entertainment industry or anywhere said erwin okun a friend and 
spokesman for the walt disney co

the world okun said he was a giant in the entertainment 
industry we are also grieving for his wonderful family

cigarettes he smoked 
his work on stage screen and television displayed a versatility 
matched by few though scorned by some as merely a gilded las vegas 
drone and criticized by others as being a token of the rat 
pack davis was greatly admired and respected as an entertainers

french quarter jazz will be as cool as ever 
but somewhat quieter at least temporarily now that a judge has 
ordered one bourbon street club to turn down its volume 
civil court judge george connolly on tuesday told the famous 
door to turn down its sound to within the limits set by city noise 
laws 
the clubs operators however dont feel theyve broken any 
laws and say they may appeal 
the decree was sought by the royal sonesta hotel which filed 
suit earlier this month claiming the famous doors loud music was a 
nuisance that had generated complaints from hotel guests more 
than 100 since jan 1 
were most pleased sonesta attorney mark van horn said of 
connollys order which remains in effect pending a full trial of 
the case 
to convince connolly of the need for an immediate order the 
hotel produced noiselevel readings taken by an expert on certain 
nights in recent months including some taken in the sonestas 
secondfloor balcony rooms 
lois and louis karno who operate the famous door said its 
impossible to accurately measure noise near their club because of 
fluctuating amounts of noise coming from crowds in the street and 
from other nightclubs nearby two of which are operated by the 
royal sonesta 
but connolly sided with the hotel saying it is possible to 
estimate the noise levels fairly and accurately and that the 
hotels expert had done so 
the famous door violated noise limits for the french quarter 
and the sonesta is justified in branding the clubs loud music a 
nuisance that threatens the hotels business and reputation 
connolly said

pneumonia a disease that strikes about 2 million americans each 
year is primarily a hazard of the very young and very old and 
rarely kills people who are in otherwise good health 
muppet creator jim henson who died unexpectedly wednesday of 
pneumonia at age 53 was an exception to the usual pattern of the 
disease 
while pneumonia causes the deaths of between 40000 and 70000 
people annually many are already ill with other serious diseases 
such as heart disease or cancer 
pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs that is most often 
caused by streptococcus pneumoniae the bacteria that caused 
hensons illness many other forms of bacteria as well as viruses 
can also cause this common illness 
in hensons case doctors said the disease was so advanced when 
he reached the hospital that the infection had spread throughout 
his body attacking other organs at that point it could not be 
controlled with antibiotics the usual therapy 
although pneumonia can strike at any age infants and the 
elderly are often victims for many it is a mild complication of 
the sniffles but it can also be life threatening especially if 
peoples immune defenses are already weakened 
according to the american public health association pneumonia 
caused by the streptococcus bacteria is fatal in about 20 percent 
to 40 percent of victims who already have major underlying diseases 
among those who are at especially high risk of pneumonias 
complications are people whose immune systems have been weakened by 
diseases or medicines pneumonia is a common hazard of people with 
aids 
dr david m gelmont director of intensive care at new york 
hospitalcornell medical center in new york said aids was not a 
factor in hensons death 
categorically he did not have aids said gelmont 
pneumonia also frequently occurs in people who take 
immunesuppressing drugs because of organ transplants cancer 
medicines or steroid drugs for such diseases as rheumatoid 
arthritis

friend not only to me but to anyone whose life he touched said 
dean martin who with davis sinatra and bishop was among 
hollywoods funloving and highliving rat pack in the 1960s 
sammy was the type of person who if i were to call him and say 
im doing a benefit he would drop everything and be there in a 
minute said comedian bob hope who said he and davis had done 30 
or 40 television shows and numerous charity benefits together over 
the years

eight former members of the 
african national congress said wednesday they were among dozens 
imprisoned and tortured by the organization while in exile they 
also said the anc executed several dissidents 
the allegations of mistreatment at anc prison camps in angola 
were similar to those made by other exanc members in recent weeks 
we left this country with high ideals of bringing freedom to 
our people however the years in exile unfortunately have proved 
different mueze twala one of the eight told a news conference 
the leadership of the anc presided over by president oliver 
tambo has never practiced democracy and has violated human 
rights 
twala said he spent almost five years at the ancs quatro prison 
camp in angola he was moved to tanzania in 1988 then expelled 
from the anc late last year 
all eight said they were held at the quatro camp and either were 
tortured or witnessed abuses that included beatings with sticks and 
pouring boiling water on the heads of prisoners 
the eight said they were never told why they were detained or 
given a hearing 
the group said dozens of prisoners were held at any given time 
at the quatro camp they said several prisoners died due to poor 
living conditions and seven were executed following a revolt by 
dissidents at the ancs pango camp in angola in 1984 
they said chris hani a leader of ancs armed wing presided 
over a tribunal that ordered the executions 
we are aware of the names of people now lying in shallow 
graves in africa and we would like to make contact with their 
parents or relatives who must demand an explanation from the anc 
twala said we are also concerned about those who are fugitives 
from the anc suffering in exile and looking for a way to return to 
south africa 
the eight including two women said that possibly hundreds of 
anc dissidents were either in detention or unaccounted for the anc 
has an estimated 15000 members living outside south africa 
nelson mandela deputy president of the anc recently 
acknowledged that anc security forces tortured some dissidents and 
members believed to be agents of the south african government 
he said the practice was never anc policy and was halted when 
top anc officials learned of the mistreatment 
the eight exanc members said they decided to return to south 
africa after president fw de klerk legalized the anc and other 
black opposition groups in february 
the eight were detained by police when they arrived at the 
johannesburg airport on april 24 all were released tuesday 
the government and the anc held their first ever talks two weeks 
ago and are working together to remove obstacles to full 
constitutional negotiations

the ira claimed responsibility for a bomb blast 
wednesday outside an army recruiting office in north london that 
killed an army sergeant and seriously injured another soldier 
the explosion came just two days after an ira bomb buried in a 
flowerbed outside an army office in southeast london blew a hole 
in the building and injured seven civilians 
scotland yard said an explosive device detonated at 512 
pm just after two sergeants got into an unmarked army van parked 
behind an army careers information office in wembley north london 
a woman civilian clerk waiting to get into the van suffered from 
shock but was not injured police said 
in a statement released to news organizations wednesday night in 
dublin the ira said a small device containing two pounds of 
explosives was planted in the military vehicle outside a british 
army recruiting office which had been under surveillance for some 
time 
while the british government persists in its continued 
occupation of the north of ireland the ira will persist in 
attacking the british government and its forces in england 
all three of the victims worked at the recruiting office of the 
territorial army britains parttime volunteer reserve force 
scotland yard said the injured man and the clerk were taken to 
northwick park hospital his condition was believed to be stable 
the defense ministry identified the dead soldier as sgt charles 
chapman 34 married with two children 
armed forces minister archie hamilton visted the injured 
sergeant and said the soldier was sitting in the back of the van 
when the bomb went the soldier suffered from cuts bruises smoke 
inhalation and some damage to his eardrums 
charles baggett who lives near the center said on bbctv that 
he heard a very violent explosion and ran down the street where 
he saw a badly burned man being led away the van itself was just 
a tangled mass quite horrific really he said 
hamilton said it was the first time london had seen two bomb 
attacks so close together i think we are being subjected to a 
campaign of terror by them the ira this is a new situation and 
we must assume they will try elsewhere possibly in the london area 
in the near future he said on channel 4 tv news 
speaking before the ira claim of responsibility was released 
home secretary david waddington said yet again we see a 
sickening attack by the ira which can do no good to their cause or 
to the name of the irish people

antiterrorist squad visited the site of the explosion and warned 
soldiers and other people involved in northern ireland affairs to 
check their vehicles

unite the protestantdominated north with the overwhelmingly roman 
catholic republic of ireland in the south

the directorate of army education in the residential area of

heavy crude oil that leaked from a damaged 
liberian tanker washed up on britains southern shore wednesday 
forcing authorities to close several popular tourist beaches 
oil washed up on 12 miles of beaches and coves forming bigbury 
bay east of plymouth in far western england authorities closed 
beaches to permit an unhindered cleanup 
we were fighting a battle against the elements and the wind 
won said commander john bywater of the department of transports 
marine pollution control unit bywater is supervising teams of 
workers equipped with bulldozers and shovels 
the oil came from the liberianregistered supertanker rosebay 
which had been loaded with iranian crude for sweden the vessel was 
damaged in a collision with the devon trawler dionne marie on 
saturday in the english channel 
about 1000 tons of oil or 293916 gallons were spilled 
government officials say half that amount was cleaned up with 
airdropped chemicals and ships that sucked it up from the sea 
but raw crude and huge patches of oil emulsified into a brown 
sludge by the chemicals could be seen drifting to shore officials 
said the cleanup could take a month to complete 
lawmaker anthony steen who represents the area told the house 
of commons the sludge was 18 inches thick in one cove 
steen and others said tankers should have double hulls to 
prevent similar spillages 
shipping minister patrick mcloughlin said the collision was 
being investigated 
he said it was the trawlers duty to give way he said it had 
not altered its course although the 275000ton tanker had taken 
evasive action 
richard clark chief executive of devon county council said the 
international tankers owners pollution federation representing 
the rosebays owners had agreed to pay for the cleanup no cost 
estimate was given 
clark said the blackened areas should be clean before the main 
tourist season begins 
the royal society for the protection of birds said the area is 
not among britains biggest breeding grounds for seabirds 
however it said cormorants kittyhawks guillemots shags and 
gulls at the marine nature reserve of wembury bay were threatened 
by the slick 
some oilsoaked seabirds have been washed ashore on area 
beaches the society said

dozens of growling bears and chattering 
monkeys were paraded by prime minister vp singhs home on 
wednesday to protest a government ban on animal street shows 
snakes in their baskets were taken on the twomile march that 
caused traffic jams and even some panic forcing police to 
accompany the men and boys who earn their livings performing with 
animals and reptiles 
police halted the procession a halfmile from singhs house a 
customary security precaution during the capitals frequent 
protests over political and social issues 
a man dressed as a monkey jumped from tree branch to tree branch 
en route and pretended to snatch food from roadside vendors 
children on their way home from school looked bewildered some 
clapped while others peeped from behind trees 
bread is more important than environment read a placard 
hung around the neck of a 12yearold bear paraded in the midday 
103degree heat 
at least 1 million indians earn their bread by holding 
roadside shows with bears monkeys goats snakes and mongooses 
said the protests spokesman and organizer dhirendra pratap 
and you want to stop it if you do it they will all die of 
hunger he said referring to both the handlers and their animals 
on may 1 minister of state for environment maneka gandhi 
ordered police to enforce a decadeold law that bans animal shows 
mrs gandhi said many of the animals especially the bears die of 
mistreatment and heat the bears are naturally found in the much 
cooler himalayan foothills 
mrs gandhi an animal lover ordered all such animals picked up 
and kept in zoos until they can be freed in the forests 
officials from her ministry visited several homes of handlers to 
try to persuade them to part with their animals but were chased 
away pratap said 
in a test case indias bestknown performing bear munna was 
taken by police and brought to the city zoo munna earned fame 
during the 1985 festival of india in france the bear was kidnapped 
in paris by an animal activist group and later found in a forest 
at least two dozen policemen came to my house and asked me to 
bring munna to the police station where i was forced to put him in 
a cage under threat said nasir khan kalandar the bears owner 
todays march is also to seek freedom for munna the 
75yearold man said wiping tears from his eyes 
kalandar said munna did not eat for six days in the zoo he 
ate only when my wife visited him the other day 
environment ministry officials said the decision to take the 
bears and other animals stemmed from a desire to prevent cruelty 
the poor things go through a terrible period of socalled 
training and our minister decided to put a stop on that said 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity 
there are no official statistics on how many bears monkeys 
snakes and mongooses are in the custody of performers nationwide 
the figure will run into thousands for the animals and tens of 
thousands for the snakes said pratap 
in new delhi 250 bears 2000 monkeys 10000 snakes and 1000 
mongooses are used for entertainment shows he said 
these animals are like our sons said hasan din a 
performer my family is totally dependent on moti bhalu he 
said pointing to a 10yearold sloth bear 
pratap asked if mrs gandhi can keep 15 dogs at her home why 
cant these people keep the animals 
mrs gandhi runs a hospital and sanctuary for animals on the 
outskirts of new delhi and her own lawn is usually crowded with 
abandoned dogs and orphaned puppies

a pioneering company in 
the commercial space industry launched another privately funded 
rocket wednesday completing experiments that had to be aborted in 
a failed flight last year 
the 52foot starfire 1 rocket built by space services inc of 
houston whose president is former mercury astronaut donald k 
deke slayton blasted off at about 840 am to the cheers of 
about 100 spectators at the white sands missile range 
ten of the 12 experiments carried aloft in the consort 3 payload 
were successfully completed mission officials said mechanical 
failures knocked out two experiments 
thats how the launches ought to look said ssi vice 
president pete armitage as the rocket shot above the san andres 
mountains into the cloudless blue sky leaving behind a thin tail 
of white smoke 
ssi launched the first licensed commercial rocket in march 1989 
essentially inaugurating the commercial space industry in the 
united states wednesdays 25 million flight was sponsored by the 
university of alabama at huntsvilles consortium for commercial 
development in space 
sixteen nasasponsored consortiums exist in the united states to 
develop the commercial space industry alabamahuntsvilles 
consortium receives about 4 million a year from the national 
aeronautics space administration 
the rockets payload dubbed consort 3 was made up of the same 
experiments that flew aboard a rocket launched in november 1989 
that flight consort 2 was terminated 30 seconds after takeoff 
when the rocket flew off course the payload survived the flight 
officials considered cancelling the consort 3 flight when they 
found problems in the roll resolving gyro which is part of the 
rockets guidance system but a halfhour of checks and maneuvering 
of the rocket on the launch pad fixed the problem armitage said 
the launch was delayed 10 minutes for the replacement of radar 
equipment that failed 
we were scratching our heads pretty hard there for a while 
wondering whether we should scrub or not said slayton 
the rocket sailed 1892 miles into space before coasting for 
about seven minutes in microgravity critical for the 12 
experiments aboard the rocket after 15 minutes the payload 
parachuted back to earth 54 miles north of the launch site and 
parts of the booster were recovered by helicopter 
scientists were studying their experiments wednesday afternoon 
to determine the microgravity effects 
francis wessling associate director of the alabamahuntsvilles 
consortium said the flight was a disappointment for his experiment 
wessling was testing whether polyurethane insulation used in 
homes and which could be used in space station construction 
could be made stronger lighter or better in space than the 
polyurethane insulation produced on earth 
the chemicals in his experiment were supposed to form a foam 
ball we didnt get a foam ball we just got a mix of a shiny 
liquid that sprayed all over the place he said 
a bricklike device containing dozens of small vials also didnt 
function the device called a materials dispersion apparatus was 
supposed to align the vials to mix chemicals but never moved 
during the flight 
we did everything we were supposed to and it didnt work so 
were going to do some testing this afternoon said jaak 
holemans manager of commercial space programs for instrumentation 
technology associates inc ita is the maker of the materials 
dispersion apparatus 
a similar itamanufactured device aboard the rocket worked 
holemans said that device will be used for experiments the company 
will fly on the space shuttle atlantis in november 
he said clients who paid 75000 for vial space on the rocket 
flight will have their experiments flown on the next ssi flight 
slayton said ssi hopes to launch 12 commercial rockets this year

excess water thundered through a dams floodgates at record 
levels wednesday as a flood crest crossed a texas reservoir 
flooding subdivisions downstream where 7000 people were urged to 
evacuate 
muddy water that devastated arkansas crops rolled across 
thousands of acres of louisiana farms 
louisiana gov buddy roemer flew over flooded areas to check 
damage caused by the red river col frank skidmore of the army 
corps of engineers told him 700000 acres of farms and woods would 
be inundated 
severe thunderstorms also flooded parts of missouri 
mississippi kansas and illinois in oklahoma where flooding was 
largely over except around lake texoma a tornado late tuesday 
killed one person and injured eight in stillwater 
a 25yearold cleanup worker drowned when he was swept away by 
floodwaters along the red river in northeast texas raising the 
states total of floodrelated deaths to 13 
the federal emergency management agency extended a presidential 
disaster area wednesday to four more texas counties bringing the 
total to 33 counties eligible for government assistance because of 
severe weather and flooding since april 15 
roads leading to more than 15 subdivisions along the trinity 
river downstream from lake livingston in southeastern texas were 
covered with water officials said the trinity continued to soak up 
more land wednesday as a flood crest crossed the reservoir 
this is the front end of it this is just the beginning 
said jim mitchum liberty county emergency management coordinator 
the trinity river authority released water through the lake 
livingston dams floodgates at a record rate of 94800 cubic feet 
per second and authorities planned to increase the rate before 
thursday morning 
a discharge rate of 100000 cubic feet per second level was 
expected by monday said grady manis the authoritys southern 
region manager he said that level was likely to be sustained for 
six to eight days 
below lake livingston dam theres about 990 square miles 
maybe 20 percent of that is probably going to be underwater at the 
height of this manis said 
residents who did not heed earlier evacuation advisories and now 
want out can call for boat assistance from the county said mitchum 
at the rattlesnake ranch in houston county part owner and 
manager john merriwether estimates losses in cattle homes fences 
and property will exceed 1 million 
we lost cattle but how many cattle we dont know said 
merriwether part owner of the 3700head ranch about 85 miles 
north of houston some of these cattle that got in the water 
probably a lot of them are floating now 
agricultural losses also were high in arkansas 
sam walker of the agricultural stabilization and conservation 
service said about 281000 acres of cropland had been affected by 
high water primarily along the arkansas and red rivers 
during the weekend a quarter of little river county in 
southwest arkansas was under water 
we had 70000 acres flooded including 40000 acres of row 
crops and 25000 acres of wheat all gone county judge clyde 
wright said we had 18000 head of cattle in the area we dont 
know how many lived 
i know ranchers who will never recoup their losses from this 
flood the judge said 
on may 1 it was estimated that 138 million acres of wheat 
would be harvested in arkansas this year the flooding could affect 
about 13 percent of that total 
and ron chastain also of the conservation service said very 
little planting is going on because of the wet ground if they 
plant later theres a potential lower yield and greater potential 
for the crop failing if they plant real late he said 
in louisiana the red river crested tuesday at 345 feet at 
shreveport about 45 feet above flood stage a day early and 
nearly a foot below the predicted crest the difference was 
attributed to better water absorption upstream and less than 
expected effects from recent rain in oklahoma and arkansas 
the worst is over but were not quite out of the woods yet 
said ernest ethridge chief meteorologist at the national weather 
service in shreveport 
the water had forced 225 people out of their homes in the 
shreveportbossier city area of northwest louisiana an additional 
135 were flooded out downstream in rapides natchitoches and red 
river parishes 
in flooding elsewhere police in missouri said up to 300 people 
were evacuated on kansas citys east side during the night after 
nearly 7 inches of rain in nearby blue springs at least 60 homes 
were temporarily evacuated after rain threatened to burst the dam 
of a private lake 
flash flooding in central and southern illinois forced about 20 
families to flee five families in macon county had to be removed 
by boat police said

fear disgust and an overriding desire to protect 
her children from their father an organized crime boss drove 
betty tocco to testify against her husband she said 
in an interview published in wednesdays chicago suntimes she 
called albert tocco a ruthless thug who broke the mobs code of 
ethics and even cheated his daughter at tictactoe 
mrs tocco is believed to be the first wife of an organized 
crime leader to testify against her spouse 
tocco 61 convicted of running a racketeering and extortion 
ring on the south side of chicago was sentenced monday to 200 
years in prison and fined 2 million it was the stiffest penalty 
ever handed to a chicago mob leader 
describing what led her to testify mrs tocco said until 1986 
she believed toccos story that he was not a mob boss 
she learned otherwise when she drove to an indiana cornfield to 
pick up her husband and he told her he had just buried tony 
spilotro and his brother michael 
i couldnt believe what i was hearing she said i was 
shocked nauseated disgusted it was fathers day his sister and 
mother were coming over for a barbecue what was i supposed to say 
albert just buried the spilotros last night so we cant barbecue 
today 
she said tocco was abusive at home and threatened her and her 
children when an unexpected knock came from the front door she 
said her husband made her answer it especially after a killing 
tocco would later be linked to by federal prosecutors 
he often told her to pack his bags on a moments notice she 
said and he would disappear without telling her where he was going 
it was during one of those disappearances that fbi agents came 
looking for him tocco was arrested on jan 5 1989 after his wife 
told fbi agents that albert was trying to get her son michael out 
of the country 
toccos conviction and incarceration have done little to ease 
her fears she said 
a jailhouse informant told authorities tocco said hed like to 
get his hands around her throat 
but she believes she did the right thing 
its not because of me hes where hes at she said i 
didnt tell him to go out there and bury people to go out there

a former panamanian president whose son is 
on trial for allegedly threatening to kill president bush testified 
wednesday that presidential death threats are the way we express 
ourselves in panama 
my life was threatened thousands of times said demetrio b 
lakas who led panama from 197278 thats the way we express 
ourselves saying it and doing it are two different things 
lakas flew here from panama to testify on behalf of his son 
otto on the opening day of his trial in us district court 
a local pawnbroker told authorities that otto lakas while 
considering buying a pistol last month said he had a bullet with 
bushs name engraved on it and would blow his expletive head 
off 
otto lakas his family and friends have said the statements were 
a joke 
but secret service agents took him at his word the 21yearold 
lubbock christian university architecture student has been jailed 
without bond since his arrest april 17 
if convicted he faces five years in prison or a 250000 fine 
or both 
his attorney tommy turner told the jury wednesday that the 
government would be unable to prove lakas understood and meant 
what he was saying or that he knowingly and willfully intended to 
be taken seriously 
prosecutor paulina jacobo declined to comment 
stacy and tracy nichols twin brothers who manage their parents 
exect pawn shop said they talked to otto lakas april 4 while he 
considered buying a 357 colt revolver 
stacy nichols said lakas said the gun would be for his own 
protection 
while discussing everything that 21yearolds talk about 
stacy nichols testified wednesday lakas voiced anger about the 
december invasion of panama by us troops for which he blamed 
bush 
i have a 223caliber rifle at home and a bullet with bushs 
name engraved on it stacy nichols in a secret service 
affidavit quoted lakas as saying bush is coming to lubbock and 
i will blow his expletive head off 
stacy nichols was quoted in an april 17 secret service affidavit 
as saying he was afraid to tell authorities of lakas statements 
for fear of retaliation 
but he testified wednesday that lakas alleged threats were the 
only serious part of a threehour conversation filled with jokes 
nichols said he was never concerned for his own safety while 
lakas was in the shop and that he would have sold lakas the gun if 
he produced the money 
nichols also said the incident was reported only because the 
brothers mentioned it to a friend who is a police officer who told 
the secret service 
the nichols brothers and john steven barker the secret service 
agent who arrested lakas are the governments only witnesses in 
the case 
barker said a search of lakas apartment produced a 3030 
caliber rifle and a box of bullets none of which was engraved with 
bushs name 
the trial is expected to end this week

two key philippine senators said even if the sides reached an 
agreement on the bases they doubted it would win the necessary 
senate approval 
philippine delegates to the talks said the us debt could 
jeopardize prospects for extending the lease on the six bases 
which expires sept 16 1991 but the chief us delegate was 
quoted as saying he would not stand next to a cash register 
while trying to settle the question 
president bush said in washington that he was studying 
alternative locations for us bases in case the negotiations fail 
if we are not wanted there we are not going to be there 
bush said at a news conference its not something absolutely 
essential for the united states 
the two sides called off an afternoon negotiating session to 
attend a memorial service at clark air base for two us airmen 
slain sunday the eve of the talks opening 
communist rebels claimed responsibility for killing airmen john 
h raven 19 of delta junction alaska and james c green 20 of 
craig colo and threatened more attacks until all american 
occupational troops left the country 
in a message read at the ceremony bush promised the deaths 
would not deter the united states from the cause of freedom 
terrorism will not deflect our nation from its purpose to 
preserve and protect democracy and freedom the message said 
the killings prompted a tightening of security by military and 
civil aviation officials 
the manager of manilas ninoy aquino international airport 
eduardo carrascoso said the staff assigned to check planes owned 
by us carriers or bound for the united states had been doubled 
and that scrutiny of cargo would include the use of bombsniffing 
dogs 
united airlines continental airlines and northwest airlines 
operate in the country philippine airlines also flies from manila 
to hawaii and california 
restrictions were also tightened further for the 40000 troops 
defense department civilian employees and military dependents 
sources in the us military community said 
at clark air base airmen formerly housed in civilian hotels 
were brought back to the base sailors and marines who had been 
living offpost were ordered back to barracks at subic the sources 
said 
in manila meanwhile police turned back more than 300 people 
including roman catholic nuns who tried to march to the us 
embassy to protest the six bases police said 15 people were 
arrested 
during wednesdays talks the philippine panel charged that the 
united states had fallen behind by 2226 million in aid promised 
in return for use of the facilities us officials put the 
shortfall at 96 million 
the two sides agreed to appoint a committee to study the matter 
but the us response was chilly us spokesman stanley schrager 
quoted richard armitage the chief us delegate as saying he does 
not stand next to a cash register when conducting foreign 
relation 
us officials said armitage would leave the philippines on 
friday when the first phase of talks is scheduled to end they 
said he would return if the two sides decide to continue the talks 
the current talks are considered exploratory to determine 
whether the two governments will begin formal negotiations on a new 
agreement officials have said this first phase of talks could be 
extended beyond friday 
even if an agreement is reached two philippine senators 
expressed doubts it would win the needed ratification sen leticia 
ramosshahani chairwoman of the senate foreign relations 
committee and sen ernesto maceda chairman of the chambers 
defense committee said they did not believe lawmakers would 
approve a pact 
us officials say if no agreement can be reached the bases 
will be closed 
in canberra australia prime minister bob hawk said his country 
would not allow the united states to base nuclear weapons in its 
territory if the bases in the philippines were closed 
the issue was raised by a report of a study by the rand corp 
an american think tank which said australia was a possible option 
if the united states had to leave the philippines 
as a matter of policy the pentagon does not say whether us 
vessels carry nuclear weapons

puppeteer extraordinaire jim henson who gave 
his voice to kermit the frog and his elfin spirit to a multitude of 
muppets as they taught and delighted millions worldwide died 
unexpectedly wednesday he was 53 
henson who lived in manhattan died at 130 am of 
complications from pneumonia said a statement issued by new york 
hospital henson had been admitted to the hospital early tuesday 
with galloping pneumonia untreated for at least three days the 
hospital said 
theres a lot less sunshine in the world today opera diva 
beverly sills said 
hensons creatures first appeared in 1954 and he watched them 
explode from a local television favorite to a worldwide phenomenon 
and multimilliondollar industry 
his sesame street characters from kermit to oscar the 
grouch to big bird were welcomed into homes around the united 
states each morning for the past 21 years it was too soon to 
assess how his death would affect the show said spokeswoman mary 
sue holland 
the muppet show which starred kermit and miss piggy and 
debuted in 1976 became the most widely seen television program in 
the world attracting an estimated 235 million viewers in 100 
countries his magic touch was evident again this year with his 
work on the box office smash teenage mutant ninja turtles 
he was our generations charlie chaplin mae west wc fields 
and marx brothers and he drew from all of them to create a new art 
form said joan ganz cooney chairman of childrens television 
workshop which produces sesame street 
an emotional lena horne who appeared frequently with hensons 
characters over the past 20 years said she had missed the 
puppeteer tuesday night at a gathering of the sesame street 
cast and friends but she had no idea henson was near death 
this has just overwhelmed me she said we just cant 
afford to keep losing our great people 
i never met a kinder gentler wonderful soul in the 
entertainment industry or anywhere said erwin okun a friend and 
spokesman for the walt disney co 
we are deeply saddened profoundly shocked at a great loss for 
the world okun said he was a giant in the entertainment 
industry we are also grieving for his wonderful family 
henson married his wife jane in 1959 and they had five 
children 
under an agreement signed last summer the walt disney 
entertainment empire purchased the rights to blend kermit the frog 
miss piggy and other animal characters created by henson into its 
theme parks movies tv shows and retail merchandising products 
henson created the muppets 36 years ago but they became 
immensely popular after their debut in 1969 on sesame street 
kermit cookie monster bert ernie and grover delighted parents 
while instructing their children 
while miss piggy was modeled after mae west his characters had 
star appeal that attracted diverse performers such as opera singer 
placido domingo and actor danny devito characters such as meryl 
sheep were named after celebrities 
puppets have the same sort of graceful aging that cartoon 
characters have henson said in a 1986 interview im sure 
kermit will stay younger a lot longer than i will 
hensons work with the muppets earned him many awards including 
a peabody for excellence in television programming and a grammy for 
a muppet album his saturday morning cartoon show the muppet 
babies won four consecutive emmys for outstanding animated 
program 
henson admitted the word muppet was something he just made 
up although to appease interviewers he would say it was a 
combination of marionette and puppet in addition to 
kermit he did the voices of ernie and game show host guy smiley 
millions of children grew up on sesame street which is seen 
in more than 80 countries and has 15 international coproductions 
the show is aimed at children 1 to 5 teaching basic math and 
english to children around the world although the program was 
initially intended to assist innercity children its popularity 
far transcended that 
henson educated adults as well not only was jim a good friend 
for 20 years he was the person who taught me more than anyone 
else said bob mcgrath a sesame street regular for two 
decades 
bob keeshan televisions captain kangaroo said henson 
never talked down to children he never degraded children and 
thats why his work was universally accepted 
his contribution was not just to childrens tv keeshan 
added jims work really was universal and appreciated by adults 
as much as children 
fred rogers host of another childrens program mister rogers 
neighborhood noted hensons enormous contributions to public 
television 
you could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands 
and himself into them rogers said 
peggy charren founder of action for childrens television a 
lobbying group said i can hardly believe it he was so young 
and there was so much ahead for him to do 
hensons death was the third to strike sesame street in the last 
year joe raposo who wrote many of the songs for the popular 
childrens series died last year at age 52 a televised tribute to 
raposo was scheduled for wednesday night former cast member 
northern calloway who played david also died recently 
first lady barbara bush who recently appeared on sesame 
street to promote her literacy campaign released a statement 
saying 
mr hensons pioneering contribution through the educational 
and entertaining sesame street and muppets characters was unique in 
the history of television 
his dedication to wholesome childrens programming has 
enlivened the minds of young and old alike mr hensons 
originality and creativity will influence entertainers educators 
and most important of all children for generations to come 
dr david m gelmont who treated henson at the hospital said 
henson apparently came down with the flu on friday in north 
carolina and was examined by a doctor there who did not find the 
pneumonia 
his condition worsened and henson returned to new york on 
monday but the pneumonia ultimately resulted in multiorgan 
failure gelmont said in response to a reporters question 
gelmont said the pneumonia was categorically not aidsrelated 
asked why henson might have allowed his health to deteriorate 
for several days without seeking further help susan berry a 
publicist for jim henson productions replied 
my guess is he was totally absorbed he couldnt be bothered 
he was very cavalier with his health ive known him for five 
years and i think he was sick twice during that time 
henson was born in greenville miss on sept 24 1936 
the muppets first appeared on a local washington dc 
television program sam and friends kermit made his debut on 
the show which won a local emmy in 1959 
during the 1960s henson and his troupe appeared regularly on 
the jimmy dean show and the ed sullivan show rowlf a 
talking dog frequently carried on conversations with dean 
things broke wide open for henson when his characters appeared 
on sesame street in 1969 he introduced the muppet show in 
1976 and it captured three emmys during its fiveyear syndicated 
run 
the muppets also appeared in the first year of saturday night 
live in 1975 the creations for that show included the idollike 
mighty fuvog 
his recent television work included the ghost of faffner 
hall on hbo and fraggle rock for cable tv he won another 
emmy for the jim henson hour a special on nbc 
hensons puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with the 
muppet movie followed by the great muppet caper in 1981 and 
the 1984 the muppets take manhattan which ended with the 
marriage of kermit and miss piggy 
henson also directed the fantasy films the dark crystal in 
1982 and labyrinth in 1986 he codirected the former with 
frank oz the voice of miss piggy 
his family said plans for a memorial service will be announced 
later

britains unelected house of lords is preparing to 
kill government legislation to allow trials of suspected nazi war 
criminals 
it would be the first time in modern history that the lords 
mostly hereditary aristocrats have rejected outright a bill passed 
by the elected house of commons 
nazi hunters are distressed but some in the lords argue that 
fair trials are impossible at a distance of up to 50 years that 
the crimes were not committed on british soil and that retroactive 
legislation is unjust 
the expected rejection of the bill in a lords vote on june 4 
has revived qualms about the powers still vested in this unique 
collection of bluebloods bishops jurists and recently ennobled 
politicians all of whom owe their place in the upper chamber to 
birth or political patronage

in a letter to members of congress they said such an increase

to support societal goals the letter says we need to do so 
again to curb the terrible toll alcohol is taking 
signers included officials of the national council of churches 
and its evangelical counterpart the national association of 
evangelicals mormons southern baptists and several other 
protestant denominations their membership totals more than 60 
million 
saying that the excise tax on wine and beer has not been raised 
since 1951 the letter cites a report by former surgeon general c 
everett koop that increasing the tax 25 cents on a can of beer and 
147 per bottle of wine would bring in 206 billion in new

roman catholic high schools once taught mainly 
by nuns and religious brothers but now staffed mainly by lay 
teachers still are making a special impact on students 
a study finds theyre more concerned for others and more 
critical of militarism than public school students however 
catholic students are less enthusiastic about school perhaps 
because its tougher 
these are among findings of a comparative analysis done by a 
research center the search institute of minneapolis of an annual 
government survey of 16000 high school seniors 
the examination of effects of schools on student values beliefs 
and behaviors commissioned by the national catholic educational 
association turned up these conclusions 
that seniors in catholic schools have stronger promarriage 
attitudes and indicate more concern for others including greater 
wilingness to contribute money to help them than do their public 
school counterparts 
that the catholic students are less supportive of military 
programs than public school students suggesting a shift in 
catholic thinking which once was most solidly supportive of the 
military 
that catholic seniors in terms of faith and church 
dedication are more religious than public school students as 
measured by church attendance contributions and degree of 
importance attached to religion 
that paradoxically while the catholic seniors are more 
consistently determined to get a college education they have a 
less positive attitude toward school now than do public school 
students 
the researchers suggested that the catholic students edginess 
about their present school experience is because of its more 
rigorous academic demands 
of the overall results michael guerra executive director of 
the nceas secondary schools department said the evidence 
clearly demonstrates that catholic schools succeed in touching the 
hearts of their students 
he said other influences than the school may contribute to the 
differences observing 
unlike its public school counterpart the catholic high school 
is part of a larger setting in which strength is drawn from a 
common moral lnaguage a common history and a shared vision of the 
human journey 
the study also turned up differences in family and personal 
background between students in schools run and paid for by the 
church and students in governmentrun public schools paid for by 
taxes 
catholic seniors were more likely to have grown up in larger 
urban communities and their parents generally have higher education 
than was the case for public school students 
also the catholic students had fewer nights out and fewer hours 
working on jobs during the average school week than did the public 
school students catholic students also were more likely to live in 
a twoparent home 
a special finding on a point of wide concern was that the 
beliefs values and behaviors of the current catholic seniors are 
about the same as held by their precursor classes in past years 
there has been a great concern about the decline in moral 
values and visions of the nations youth during this past decade 
guerra said adding 
this study shows that in general recent catholic high school 
graduates have reported beliefs vaules and behaviors consonant 
with purposes of catholic schools and consistent with their 
predecessors 10 years ago 
he said school climate parental involvement teacher 
commitment and strong school leadership may have an even greater 
impact on formation of student values than they do on academic 
achievement 
sister catherine t mcnamee ncea president noting that the 
organizations theme for this year is catholic education 
transforming our world said 
what more dramatic way to transform the world than to graduate 
students who bring to society the strong beliefs and values 
instilled in them by catholic secondary schools

the grand old flag issue is back just in time 
for the political fireworks season it will ignite some no matter 
which way the supreme court rules on the law against flag burning 
overturn it and congress will quickly consider and almost 
certainly approve a constitutional amendment to ban burning the 
american flag just as certainly the showoffs who helped generate 
the issue in the first place will show up again with flags and 
matches 
there arent many of them and not many flags would be burned 
enough to fuel the independence day political oratory though and 
to help put the whole matter into the middle of the congressional 
and state election campaigns 
with the law upheld and a jail term threatening there would be 
fewer flag burnings or defacings but the same handful of 
demonstrators would set about finding other ways to make themselves 
offensive and they probably would succeed 
but with a big difference if the court upholds the statute 
they will be a brief sideshow should the law be overturned they 
will get a new round of national attention while congress begins 
the process of trying to write a ban on flag burning into the 
constitution 
the more effective way to get flag burning off the agenda would 
be to ignore the people who do it since there arent many of them 
and they wouldnt bother if nobody paid attention but that seems a 
political impossibility 
the flag burning episode that caused the whole controversy dates 
from the 1984 republican national convention in dallas it went 
largely unnoticed for five years until the court overturned the 
conviction of the demonstrator involved 
that produced the issue overnight with the issue came the 
demonstrators who tend to vanish if ignored then the new law 
the flag protection act of 1989 makes it a crime punishable by 
up to a year in prison to burn mutilate deface or trample a flag 
it was passed in an effort to overturn by statute the supreme 
courts reversal of a texas law against flag burning the court 
held that law violated the first amendment guarantee to freedom of 
speech 
president bush wanted a constitutional amendment adopted then 
on grounds that an act of congress couldnt reverse the court 
ruling and protect the flag from burning but democrats pushed the 
law instead of an amendment and bush let it take effect without 
his signature 
the overturned texas law banned the burning or defacing of the 
flag as an act of contempt that would seriously offend others the 
new federal law doesnt mention motives it simply bans the 
desecration of the flag as soon as it was enacted it was 
challenged by demonstrators who burned flags on the steps of the 
capitol and outside a federal court in seattle 
federal judges in both cities held the law unconstitutional the 
supreme court then took it up on a fast track heard arguments on 
monday and will issue its decision before recessing for the summer 
speaker of the house thomas s foley has promised he will put a 
constitutional amendment on flag burning up to a vote within 30 
days if the court overturns the statute he also said he would vote 
no because there should be no tinkering with the bill of rights 
such an amendment would be the first change in the first amendment 
since it was adopted 199 years ago 
it would take a twothirds vote in each house of congress to 
approve an amendment and send it to the states for ratification 
threequarters of them or 38 would be needed in order to make it 
part of the constitution 
the amendment bush was pushing came to a vote in the senate last 
year it got 51 votes 16 short of an absolute twothirds margin 
but some senators who voted against it said they would support an 
amendment should the statute be overturned and majorities in both 
parties probably would line up that way 
gov mario cuomo of new york warned of the political risks in a 
brief submitted to the court saying that reversal would almost 
certainly trigger a divisive battle in congress and in the states 
over amending the constitution 
the safe vote would be for patriotism and the flag especially 
in an election year the ratification process would take a lot 
longer and every time a state legislature dealt with it the tiny 
fraternity of flag burners could emerge to inflame the issue

us bombers destroyed the 
young girls home and she avidly practiced target shooting in case 
americans those monsterlike people who would not even smile at 
children invaded her homeland of north vietnam 
two decades later nguyen hanh appears regularly on americas 
cable news network hopes to hone her skills in the united states 
and says she bears no hard feelings about the past 
the 29yearold newswoman is one of four employees of staterun 
vietnam television who contribute almost every week to cnns 
world report which presents reports from local correspondents 
around the world without comment or editing 
an agreement worked out in the face of us government 
opposition provides vietnam television with the cnn service while 
the american cable network gets reporting from mrs hanh and her 
colleagues 
cnn charges a token 50 vietnamese dong a year less than a us 
penny for its service and has thrown in free a satellite 
receiving dish to be installed in hanoi by midjune 
the programs stress on foreign media doing things its own way 
can make it difficult to evaluate reporting content said stuart 
loory a cnn vice president who oversees world report but he 
said the vietnamese input has improved technically 1000 
percent he also praised mrs hanh 
she is one of those who has been working very hard to 
interpret her country to the rest of the world loory said in a 
telephone interview from cnn headquarters in atlanta 
mrs hanhs coverage for cnn normally two or threeminute 
spots has included private enterprise in ho chi minh city 
vietnams attempts to attract foreign tourists and a recent return 
by hanoi of remains of americans missing in action 
she said her early connections with america were not happy ones 
on dec 26 1972 her home in hanoi was destroyed when former 
president nixon ordered the christmas bombings to pressure 
vietnam into agreeing to peace terms 
when i was small i thought americans were terrible 
monsterlike people who would not even smile at children she 
said she remembered scoring 29 out of 30 points in target practice 
designed to prepare everyone for possible american attacks 
mrs hanh whose husband is a sports reporter for vietnam 
television graduated in english from hanois foreign language 
teachers training college and later took courses in journalism she 
hopes she can attend a training course in atlanta that cnn offers 
some world report contributors 
sometimes cnn suggests stories but its not always possible 
to do them mrs hanh said we try to think up things that will 
make foreigners understand vietnam better 
mrs hanh said vietnam television wanted to put the countrys 
best face forward to international audiences and suggested more 
leeway was allowed in critical and investigative reporting for 
domestic consumption 
unfettering communist vietnams guarded media was one argument 
used by the turner broadcasting system which owns cnn in its 
battle with the us government which initially said the networks 
dealings violated a tough us trade embargo with vietnam 
but the us congress in 1988 amended the embargo to exempt 
information materials and when the government finally backed down 
last january an administration official noted the importance of 
having us news programs in vietnam 
it still is unclear however what if any censorship vietnam 
television will exercise in disseminating the cnn service within 
the country 
after some reportedly difficult dealings with the vietnamese 
cnn owner ted turner met with vietnam television executives two 
years ago and agreement was quickly reached cnn currently has 
similar cooperative arrangements with 150 organizations in 120 
countries or other entities 
ted turner believes strongly in the free flow of information 
and sees this exchange as helping to bring vietnam back into the 
world of nations loory said

april food prices especially for vegetables 
were lower than in march fuel oil prices fell womens apparel 
prices which had soared a month earlier retreated sharply 
but health care costs soared 
for the third straight month they rose 08 percent a rate that 
if maintained would mean about 10 percent inflation this year in 
this one category 
its an old problem an alarming one a worsening one and one 
that isnt likely to be resolved without bitter debate about who 
should live and who should die and perhaps a demand that americans 
shape up or lose jobs 
victor r fuchs a health economist observes that in the period 
19471987 health care spending grew 25 percent faster per year 
than other spending and that it now consumes more than 11 percent 
of the gross national product 
that percentage compares with just 5 percent of gnp in 1947 it 
comes at the expense of other areas of the economy at the expense 
of housing and education for example it robs funds from 
environmental improvement 
if trends continue says fuchs a stanford university health 
economist the percentage will reach 20 in a few decades right 
now he says there is little prospect to substantially alter 
this trend 
the problem has myriad causes judging from the vast number 
typically named by specialists in the field among them 
high labor costs without increases in productivity poor 
hospital management technological innovation aging population 
poor health habits thirdparty payments that remove patient 
incentives to save 
fuchs who is also a researcher at the national bureau of 
economic research in cambridge mass observes that health care 
wages have risen more rapidly than those of other workers while 
productivity gains have been slower 
his figures show that net incomes of physicians rose about 8 
percent a year in 19771987 while the wages of private 
nonagricultural workers rose about 55 percent a year 
many businesses are attacking the rising cost to them by 
requiring workers to fund more of the bill for health insurance 
a survey of 1900 companies by a foster higgins amp co a 
benefits consultant showed 45 percent require contributions for 
individual coverage vs 39 percent in 1988 
the same survey showed that individual deductibles once 
commonly placed at 100 are now often at 300 and that 72 percent 
of employers require employees to pay some portion of hospital 
charges compared with 66 percent in 1988 
some smaller companies are putting their workers on the payrolls 
of employee leasing companies whose large number of workers allow 
them to obtain lower health insurance rates and lower costs for 
other benefits as well 
barry kerr director of employee leasing of new york inc 
claims that our typical client reduces his medical insurances 
costs anywere from 20 percent to 35 percent when we take over the 
payroll 
larger companies and insurers too also are becoming more aware 
of the need to emphasize preventive medicine to teach better 
health habits to convince employees to change destructive 
lifestyles 
a health and fitness survey of 2000 employees at steelcase 
inc a michigan manufacturing company found that just 10 percent 
of the employees accounted for 66 percent of the companys health 
care costs 
the study conducted by the university of michigan fitness 
research center found that many of the workers health problems 
involved smoking alcohol drugs highfat diets lack of exercise 
and uncontrolled high blood pressure 
more than half of all chronic diseases including cancer and 
heart disease said the centers director professor dw edington 
are related to lifestyle it is a rare company nevertheless that 
offers incentives to better lifestyles 
without some fundamental change it is obvious that health care 
costs will eat like a cancer into other areas of the economy 
devouring funds once aimed at improving environment child care 
housing education and social issues 
the michigan findings provoked edington to make this comment 
we are swiftly moving into an era of increasing conflict 
between two prized american values access to health care and the 
freedom to choose how we live something has to give

leaders of eight national religious bodies 
including some that rarely work together have backed a proposed 
increase in the federal excise tax on alcoholic beverages 
in a letter to members of congress they said such an increase 
could discourage alcohol consumption and raise revenues to help 
reduce the federal deficit 
historically our nation has used excise taxes as a mechanism 
to support societal goals the letter says we need to do so 
again to curb the terrible toll alcohol is taking 
signers included officials of the national council of churches 
and its evangelical counterpart the national association of 
evangelicals and of the mormons southern baptists and several 
other protestant denominations their membership totals more than 
60 million 
saying that the excise tax on wine and beer has not been raised 
since 1951 the letter cites a report by former surgeon general c 
everett koop that increasing the tax 25 cents on a can of beer and 
147 per bottle of wine would bring in 206 billion in new 
revenue

the hapless brooklyn dodgers always could wait 
till next year but theres only one year for the longsuffering 
house republicans 1992 
the gop now outnumbered 257176 foresees a convergence of 
political fortunes that could wrest control of the house from the 
democrats in the 1992 elections theyve been marshalling all their 
hope money and energy to that endoing to be a unique opportunity said 
house minority 
leader bob michel rill if it doesn 
it is gt happen this time a lot 
of our members are going to feel like well judas priest what is 
the use 
frustrated is the term most frequently used to describe the 
minority party in the house frustrated and hungry 
dealing with the frustration is one of the most serious 
issues said rep jerry lewis of california chairman of the 
house republican conference you cant have over time a 
substantial number of your members throwing up their hands you 
continually have to work on it 
republicans last held a majority when president eisenhower was 
in his first term and the dodgers still were in brooklyn through 
the 1960s and 1970s the words democratic and congress 
seemed forever mated 
t works and everybody hugs everybody else 
except for the last part thats a scenario being proposed by 
the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics although 
asteroid orbits rarely intersect earths the aiaa thinks we should 
be ready for one that might 
we have the technology needed to detect and track such an 
object and possibly to divert it from an impending impact the 
aiaa said we would be derelict if we did nothing 
in a position paper the institute suggested that searches of 
the heavens be increased perhaps by spotting relatively 
inexpensive telescopes around the globe it also called for a study 
of ways to deflect or destroy or significantly alter the orbits 
of asteroids predicted to impact the earth 
vice president dan quayle referred to the position paper and a 
longstanding theory that asteroids could be captured and mined for 
minerals when he addressed the aiaas annual meeting earlier this 
month 
those same asteroids which promise material riches can be a 
threat as well he said in 1965 a small asteroid exploded 
high over canada with a force equivalent to an atomic bomb 
it would certainly benefit all nations to know when such a 
natural event might occur warn those who could be affected and 
maybe some day even affect whether or where such an event might 
happen quayle said 
asteroids are rocky bodies that orbit the sun between mars and 
jupiter the ones that have been observed range in size from 579 
miles in diameter down to about 700 feet 
some have struck earth in the past only last year an asteroid 
bigger than an aircraft carrier and traveling at 46000 mph passed 
within 400000 miles of the earth a distance less than twice as 
far as the moon it missed earth by only six hours 
such an object probably comes by undetected once every two or 
three years aiaa said if it landed a disaster of unprecedented 
proportions and an enormous number of casualties could result 
johan benson the institutes administrator for public policy 
said a nuclear weapon could be used to destroy or deflect an 
asteroid if it was discovered a year or so before impact 
another defense measure would be to softland a propulsion 
system on the asteroid and slowly push it into an orbit that would 
miss earth 
use of a missile would depend on the composition and size of the 
asteroid benson said it could destroy it but if exploded 
properly it could simply propel it off into another orbit 
the aiaa suggested an international agreement would be needed 
for nuclear interception and said this is a particularly good 
time to consider an international effort led jointly by the us 
and the soviet union 
last years asteroid was not discovered until it had passed dr 
bevan french a nasa scientist estimated an impact with earth 
would have equaled an explosion of 20000 hydrogen bombs 
if it had hit the northeast corridor of the us or los angeles 
or tokyo said aiaa millions of people would have died instantly 
a sixmilediameter asteroid 65 million years ago is popularly 
believed to have caused a global catastrophe that destroyed the 
dinosaurs 
earthorbit crossing asteroids clearly present a danger to the 
earth and its inhabitants said the aiaa perhaps we have been 
lucky since 1908 there have been one direct hit one atmospheric 
entry and at least two near misses

in the heart of america a team of book experts is on a special 
mission sifting through millions of dollars of treasures trying 
to write the final chapter in a mystery some feared never would be 
solved 
their task is painstaking their work daunting to pore over 
about 28000 books and papers some rare and priceless others 
ordinary and worthless determine which are stolen then match 
them with their owners 
their work stems from the fbis largestever seizure of stolen 
rare books and manuscripts a cache valued at up to 40 million 
all recovered this spring from one mans house in iowa 
while these library experts are figuring out what belongs to 
whom a bigger question looms how 
it would be interesting to know how somebody like this can go 
into library after library amassing so many books and it took so 
long to put an end to this said william moffett president of 
the association of college and research libraries 
stephen carrie blumberg 41 who is undergoing psychiatric tests 
at a missouri prison hospital after being charged with theft has a 
long history of emotional problems and scrapes with the law over 
the years authorities have nabbed him with piles of books found 
him snooping in libraries tracked and arrested him 
but this is more than the tale of a troubled man 
its the story of how difficult it is to protect some of 
americas cultural heritage how hardnosed cops know little about 
the cloistered work of rare books and how someone purportedly took 
advantage of both weaknesses 
this man apparently was quite brilliant said gary menges 
head of the university of washingtons special collections and 
preservation and chairman of the library associations rare books 
security committee 
he knows the system he knows the way things work said 
peter briscoe collection development officer at the university of 
californiariverside where blumberg was arrested in 1988 
libraries have done more and more to make things secure blumberg 
seemed to be one step ahead 
an attorney who has known blumberg and his family for years 
disagrees 
hes being portrayed as a master thief said john daubney a 
st paul minn lawyer representing blumberg in a case in that 
state this kid is totally incapable of doing this physically 
mentally or otherwise theres no question he apparently had some 
books improperly taken but the great bulk of them were 
purchased through legitimate means 
he was more of a buyer than a seller he was a collector 
said daubney noting that blumberg had an annual income of more 
than 70000 from family trusts 
blumberg who has spent time in psychiatric hospitals is a 
softspoken loner who travels to flea markets in an old truck and 
wears old clothes daubney said 
hes fascinated by stained glass windows and door knobs and once 
bought an old minneapolis mansion selling it at a 100000 profit 
the attorney added 
the kid is not stupid by any stretch daubney said he 
just thinks differently than the rest of us 
blumbergs legal troubles date back more than 20 years said 
steve huntsberry a corporal with the washington state university 
police who has tracked him as part of an investigation of rare book 
thefts at the school 
blumbergs record includes a 1967 charge of stealing antique 
doorknobs in iowa and a 1974 accusation of theft in colorado after 
his car was found stuffed with books huntsberry said the latter 
case was dropped 
in 1988 blumberg who used the alias of matt mcgue was fined 
and placed on probation after pleading guilty to trespassing and 
possessing burglary tools in the closed rarebooks section at 
californiariverside authorities say 
i knew he would get caught again somewhere huntsberry said 
i just thought he would skate through it 
but on march 20 authorities raided blumbergs house in ottumwa 
iowa carting off 19 tons of books and papers in one 40foot van 
and a load of antiques in another 
dozens of library experts including an eightmember team from a 
group called online computer library center which has a database 
of 21 million titles are helping the fbi identify and catalogue 
the books and manuscripts which are warehoused in an office 
building in omaha neb 
this is unprecedented in the book world to get that much 
attention from the authorities said jake chernofsky editor and 
publisher of ab bookmans weekly a publication for antiquarian 
book dealers 
the inventory should be computerized within four weeks said w 
dennis aiken assistant special agent in charge of the fbis omaha 
office 
when we first got into this we thought it would be an 
overwhelming impossible task he said very quickly through 
the outpouring of cooperation from the public and private literary 
sector its becoming a very manageable task 
aiken said tricks were played to conceal book owners during the 
raid a trunk of bookplates library cards and other identification 
data was found 
while some books are worthless one is valued at 70000 to 
90000 aiken said the fbi said one expert estimated all the 
volumes and papers could be worth up to 40 million 
authorities say they have found a bible from 1480 and three 
shelves of priceless materials from 14501500 an era known as the 
incunabula a period following the invention of the gutenberg press 
it was apparent that they had been chosen with great care 
david schoonover university of iowa rare books curator said of 
the nine rooms of floortoceiling books he surveyed at blumbergs 
home 
aiken said that while the books and manuscripts come from 140 
universities the bulk are from about 10 schools some libraries 
he added had no idea materials were missing 
other valuables also were seized in minnesota where blumberg 
was born and lived authorities searched three places in 
minneapolis and st paul taking more than 300 stained glass 
windows gold coins jewelry silverware door knobs antiques and 
other items 
police plan to show the public a videotape of them this week for 
identification purposes 
daubney however said he has provided the fbi with more than 
5000 receipts often nothing more than little scraps of paper 
including some for stained glass windows and gold coins 
the blumberg case some say illustrates both the problems of 
protecting rare books and investigating these thefts 
experts say rare book libraries have a delicate balancing act 
making collections accessible yet secure 
and police are novices in the area 
its not the average street creep were dealing with said 
sgt richard hansen of the eugene ore police who investigated 
the loss of 662500 worth of material including 9000 to 11000 
manuscripts believed to have been taken from the university of 
oregon library in 1987 
we dont have a network of contacts its absolutely fish 
out of water hansen said i had no idea of whos reliable 
whos not 
the librarians helping piece together the puzzle will make the 
telling difference aiken said 
we would not be able to do that without their expertise he 
said my career would be over before this got done

farmer founder of the congress of racial equality is teaching a

prominent men and women in various fields who have returned to the 
campus to share their expertise 
</TEXT>

the distinguished visiting professor 
with the patch over his right eye tugs at a tweed sleeve and bends 
an ear to his chiming wristwatch 
twentyeight minutes past one james farmer announces in 
that resonant mellifluous voice to a hushed class of 40 juniors 
and seniors leaning forward pens poised over notebooks 
as i was saying those troopers were bellowing come on out 
farmer we know youre in there 
i was meant to die that night they were kicking open doors 
beating up blacks in the streets interrogating them with electric 
cattle prods i got out alive in a hearse 
it was a lovely spring day on the campus of predominantly white 
mary washington college a state institution in historic 
fredericksburg bright sunshine slanting through the budding trees 
gave a roseate glow to the whitecolumned georgian brick buildings 
but the imposing black figure at the lecture desk in monroe hall 
was wrapped in the darkness of another time in another southern 
state 
he couldnt see the azaleas blushing at the windowsill or sniff 
the cherry blossoms just come into bloom around the fountain in the 
square there was too much tear gas billowing through the busted 
windows of the plymouth rock baptist church in plaquemine la and 
the splashing fountain brought back the swoosh of the fire hose 
washing hymn books and bibles down the aisle as the mob smashed 
pews and ransacked the church 
scared spitless farmer says recalling that violent summer 
night a quarter of a century ago 
one moment hes a terrified freedom rider pleading with the 
local telephone operator to put a call through to the white 
house the attorney general the fbi in new orleans 
then hes a redneck deputy snarling through jowls chock full of 
chaw we know youre in there farmer 
next hes the spunky lady operator of the funeral parlor down 
the street telling him to play dead in the back of that hearse 
and ordering the driver to take dirt roads known only to blacks 
since plantation days 
then hes himself the founder of core the congress of racial 
equality wondering if that night in louisiana less than a week 
after the march on washington and martin luther kings i have a 
dream speech would be his last on earth 
this guy is tremendous says senior rich cooper one of the 
students in farmers course the history of the civil rights 
movement a full threecredit course in the history department 
hes a living piece of history its hard for students our age to 
imagine an america where blacks could not go into a restaurant had 
to ride in the jim crow coach next to the engine and were hunted 
down like possums or some other swamp dweller for daring to 
register to vote 
here is a man who has changed history hes seen it all and 
now the tragedy is he sees nothing 
but in the classroom the now totally blind champion of civil 
rights sees something he never saw before in his 70 years a ray 
of hope just a glimmer 
the hope for america is with these young people he says 
gathering up a bundle of their term papers their minds are not 
closed at the beginning of the semester black kids and white kids 
alike find it difficult to grasp that this is the way things were 
here 
with martin luther king roy wilkins and whitney young now dead 
farmer is the last of the big four of the civil rights movement 
we were the knights of the round table he chuckles counting 
the nine steps down to the taxi taking him home for a brief rest 
before facing an evening class of nearly 200 freshmen and 
sophomores 
farmer is now in his fifth year at the college named for george 
washingtons mother where in a student body of 3500 twothirds 
are female and 4 percent black 
the preachers kid from marshall texas who grew up on a series 
of black baptist campuses where his father a phd from boston 
university taught theology is still at it preaching teaching 
with compelling charm a nonviolent approach to racial harmony 
eloquently he drives home the fundamental lesson of the civil 
rights movement be better than your former self not better than 
the south africans and thereby make a better world 
students are awed at farmers lack of bitterness toward those 
who have wronged him and his race 
sherry brinser a spanish major from richmond va says hes 
fascinating it all happened to him and yet theres no bitterness 
none how can he forgive what he cant forget 
in the eagles nest the student snack bar some compared farmer 
with the actor james earl jones the rich voice the fullbacks 
build the features borrowed from a roman coin the deep infectious 
laughter the mimics ability to play all parts 
they cited the morning lecture when he was suddenly the owner of 
a diner on us route 1 between new york and baltimore turning 
away young blacks trying to integrate eateries along what they had 
renamed freedom highway 
we dont serve negroes here 
well thats fine by us farmer replies in his own voice 
we dont eat them 
hes very expressive you think youre right there says 
patty charron a junior from springield va 
but hes a lot more than just a performer insists rich

reduced buyer incentives and low inventories 
contributed to an 84 percent slide in earlymay sales of north 
americanmade vehicles analysts say 
the 10 major us car and truck makers tuesday reported a 103 
percent decline in car sales and 53 percent drop in truck sales 
during the may 110 period compared with last year 
those figures leave no clear indication of a trend in the 
market said auto analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co in new 
york 
we ended april with inventory many dealers described as too 
low he said they had such a cautious attitude coming into 
this year that they know they lost some sales because of their 
caution 
the automakers said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate 
of 33448 during the may 110 period this year compared with a 
daily rate of 36524 during the same time last year 
sales of cars made by general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp slipped 169 percent while sales of cars from 
transplants or japaneseowned us manufacturing plants rose 
856 percent 
big three automakers held 865 percent of the us market for 
domestically produced cars in early may down from 935 percent a 
year earlier 
last years sales rate was strong mainly because of the 
extension of incentives the big three had been offering as this 
april wound up the companies cut back their incentive programs 
generally reducing the number of vehicles covered and lowering cash 
rebates 
that said ford spokesman joel pitcoff may have pulled some 
wouldbe may sales into april selling periods as consumers took 
advantage of the more generous incentives 
brady said if there was any such effect it was small 
i think it is very difficult to try to quantify that he 
said 
lateapril sales of the big threes domestically made vehicles 
were 01 percent higher than the same period a year ago which was 
a strong period 
for the year through may 10 sales of domestic vehicles were 
down 33 percent with car sales off 44 percent and truck sales 
down 14 percent 
chrysler which has seen its share of the us market dwindle 
said its earlymay car and truck sales were down 192 percent so 
far this year sales were off 129 percent 
ford said its combined car and truck sales during early may this 
year were 154 percent and down 79 percent for the year 
gm said its vehicle sales declined 87 percent in early may for 
the year so far sales were running 28 percent below last years 
pace

selling days last year and 111 selling days so far this year 
compared with 110 selling days in the corresponding period a year 
earlier

a deal between perkinelmer corp and a 
california company will keep a crucial semiconductor technology in 
us hands and may ease fears about an erosion of competitiveness 
against japanese chip makers 
perkinelmer said tuesday it had sold a 60 percent stake in its 
optical lithography business to silicon valley group inc of san 
jose calif for at least 20 million the division produces 
machines that manufacture computer chips and is a critical link in 
the semiconductor industry 
international business machines inc also plays a key role in 
the deal ibm is buying a minority stake in the business and has 
agreed to help develop its technology and place big orders for its 
equipment 
norwalkbased perkinelmer also will retain a minority stake 
mark fitzgerald an analyst with dataquest in san jose said the 
deal represents an effort by the american industry to save a 
business that the us had led until the japanese began making 
inroads 10 years ago 
the real story here is that were seeing us companies band 
together to defend a key technology for future chip development 
he said this is an important technology were not going to let 
it outside this country 
the division which perkinelmer has been seeking to sell for 
two years makes machines that use optical lithography to etch 
patterns on computer chips its micrascan system can etch patterns 
on smaller wafers with greater sharpness and promises to be a key 
tool in efforts to build ever more powerful computer chips 
perkinelmer reportedly discussed a possible sale of the 
division to nikon corp last year the reports touched off concern 
that a loss of such vital technology could hamper the ability of 
american chip makers to compete with japanese companies 
the divisions technology still is being developed and will not 
be used in fullscale manufacturing for two to three years 
although ibm is using three machines in essex junction vt to 
develop new semiconductors said company spokesman paul bergevin 
fitzgerald said the technology is ahead of what the japanese 
have developed 
the japanese have such an insurmountable lead at this point in 
time that if this technology went to a japanese company the us 
suppliers would be totally out of leadingedge work in 
semiconductors he said 
the deal adds another dimension to svgs semiconductor business 
the company already makes equipment that prepares wafers for the 
lithography patterning 
i can assure you with the right partners here we have an 
excellent chance to be a global supplier and global competitor 
said papken s der torossian president and chief executive officer 
of svg the company earned 96 million on sales of 130 million 
last year 
he said his company already has paid 20 million for the 
business to be called svg lithography systems inc he would not 
say if svg would make further payments or place a total value on 
the deal but said the financial arrangements would be detailed in a 
filing with the securities and exchange commission 
fitzgerald valued the business at under 100 million 
ibm will provide an unspecified amount of funds to develop the 
lithography equipment along with a chemical compound used to coat 
the wafer surface for the etching process it also has committed to 
buying tens of millions of dollars worth of the new machines 
bergevin said 
sematech a consortium of government and industry leaders also 
will provide development funding along with technical support and 
help in improving the technology said vahe a sarkissian the new 
units president 
ibm will have first dibs on the new micrascan equipment as will 
other sematech members with existing orders 
operations will be consolidated in a single building in wilton 
conn svg plans to retain all 800 workers 
for perkinelmer the sale is the final step in the companys 
twoyear effort to divest and concentrate on analytical 
instruments the company which had 784 million in sales and 47 
million in profits last year already has sold its electrooptics 
division electron beam unit and german aerospace business

ames department stores officials struggling to 
revive the ailing discount retail chain say a new 250 million 
loan agreement is the first step toward restoring confidence in the 
company 
this is what its going to take to start this company on the 
road to recovery said michael cook the lead attorney 
representing ames in hearings in us bankruptcy court where the 
credit was approved tuesday 
ames also said it had cut the number of store closings planned 
immediately from 74 to 33 but said it still is reviewing its 
operations and could close more stores later 
the nations fourthlargest retailer filed for protection from 
creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code on april 25 
after many suppliers who had not been paid for earlier deliveries 
stopped shipping merchandise the company also was unable to get a 
new credit agreement from its lenders to ease a cash flow crunch 
officials said the new 250 million line of credit will allow 
the company to pay vendors on time and keep merchandise coming into 
its 680 stores 
i believe it was what we needed to hear to give the trade 
vendors the security to feel free to ship us the goods we need 
said ames president george granoff 
the agreement approved by us bankruptcy court judge howard c 
buschman iii allows ames to borrow up to 250 million from chemical 
bank 
buschman authorized the financing after a group of 33 banks 
withdrew its objection to the plan 
in his order the judge said ames did not have sufficient 
working capital to finance its operations 
absent such availability the debtors cannot supply their 
retail stores with the inventory they need in order to ensure 
adequate sales levels and continued customer loyalty buschman 
said 
stephen l pistner ames new chief executive officer 
confidently predicted the company would make a comeback with the 
new financing 
if we want to save this company it takes money and competent 
business i know how to do the rest pistner said 
buschman postponed a final hearing on pistners appointment as 
ceo until may 24 creditors had asked for more time to review terms 
of his contract which could pay him up to 8 million in salary 
bonuses and benefits over three years 
a bank group headed by new yorks citibank withdrew its 
objection to the 250 million loan after reaching an agreement with 
ames early tuesday 
ronald dekoven an attorney for the banks said the agreement 
allows the banks to split with the company 91 million in cash 
collateral ames has in its account he said the agreement also 
resolves a dispute between ames and the bankers over outstanding 
letters of credit totaling 65 million 
ames owes the citibank group about 450 million the banks had 
objected to ames request to borrow the further 250 million 
because chemicals loan would have a higher repayment priority than 
the citibank groups debt 
antonio alvarez a principal in a new york consulting firm that 
helped ames negotiate the loan with chemical told the judge that 
the company has been unable to convince vendors to ship goods he 
said if the trend continued the company could see sales drop 40 
percent or more 
the court earlier had approved 25 million in credit from 
chemical bank ames which claims it has been losing more than 10 
million a week said it needed the additional 225 million to pay 
vendors and assure the company of merchandise for the critical 
backtoschool and christmas sale seasons 
the company has literally been bleeding to death said cook 
an attorney representing a committee of ames creditors said the 
group was satisfied with the new financing arrangement 
our committee did want this approved because the company 
needs the money to keep operating said the attorney john m 
friedman jr i think this will be a big help in getting back to a 
sense of normalcy with the vendors 
also tuesday ames said it lost 228 million or 641 a share 
in the year that ended jan 27 the loss which the company 
predicted last month compared with earnings of 42 million or 
107 a share in 1989

southpoint magazine a regional publication from 
a subsidiary of time warner inc has suspended publication after 
the june issue in another sign of tough times in the magazine 
business 
southern progress corp based in birmingham ala said tuesday 
that southpoint had not achieved its circulation and advertising 
goals 
in a difficult magazine environment we decided it best to 
utilize our resources elsewhere within our company said don 
logan chief executive of southern progress which also publishes 
books and five other magazines 
there have been signs throughout the magazine business this year 
that advertising growth has been sluggish at best the magazine 
publishers of america said advertising pages in magazines were down 
35 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with a year 
ago 
in one notable example of the depressed state of the ad market 
businessman leonard stern closed 7 days magazine last month because 
of insufficient advertising the awardwinning magazine covered the 
new york arts scene for two years 
on monday hachette sa put its womans day magazine up for sale 
the womens service magazine had suffered a 221 percent decline in 
ad pages during the first quarter following a 15 percent decline in 
circulation in 1989 
southern progress acquired a controlling interest in southern 
magazine in march 1989 and transformed it from a regional 
publication of general interest that focused on the arts 
literature and culture into one that focused on business and travel 
topics 
the transformation took effect with the october 1989 issue in 
which the monthly publications name was changed to southpoint 
we set certain goals but it did not meet our expectations in 
either advertising or circulation and newsstand sales were soft 
logan said 
he said the magazine was losing money but did not say how much 
its circulation rate base was 250000 with the large majority sold 
by subscription 
logan said the company has no plans to publish any more editions 
of the magazine after the june issue which comes out in the next 
10 days but would be interested in talking to anyone who wants to 
buy the magazine 
he said he told the staff on monday of the decision to cease 
publication and said efforts would be made to find them positions 
with the companys other publications he said southpoint employed 
27 people fulltime 
southern progress other titles include southern living a 
regional monthly home and service magazine with a 23 million 
circulation cooking light a bimonthly magazine on cooking that 
has just boosted its circulation rate base to 900000 and southern 
accents a home furnishings magazine published 10 times a year with 
a circulation of 250000 
it also publishes travel south a regional quarterly and 
progressive farmer a 103yearold magazine aimed at the rural 
market which has editions aimed at the south and the midwest with 
combined circulation of 650000

chrysler corps decision to go ahead with 
production of its highperformance viper sports car may not make 
much money for the strapped automaker but it could draw crowds 
into dealer showrooms analysts say 
a company source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
tuesday that chrysler chairman lee iacocca would announce approval 
of the project at a news conference friday in los angeles 
the source had few details about the project but said it was 
aimed at starting production in late 1991 for the 1992 model year 
production volume and a retail price were not available 
however there have been reports that chrysler was aiming at 
building no more than a few thousand a year and autoweek magazine 
said its price could be as much as 40000 
the cost of the project also was not available but company 
officials said use of a new computeraided design process was 
helping keep costs down 
the car would be equipped with a v10 engine which reportedly 
would put it in a performance class with the hottest corvette ever 
made the zr1 autoweek said it has the capability of going from a 
standing start to 100 mph in less than 10 seconds the corvette 
zr1 reaches the same speed in about 115 seconds according to a 
road test in road amp track magazine 
some analysts questioned the wisdom of developing such a 
muscular narrowly focused car when chrysler is wrestling with 
slumping sales and in the throes of a 15 billion costcutting 
program 
charles brady of oppenheimer amp co said he wasnt excited about 
the project but thought it would do respectably well in the market 
if you are going to make a penny on it in low volume youre 
going to have to price it up there he said 
analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc of new 
york said there was a place for the car 
there is an enthusiasts market out there she said if 
they come out with something thats really sensational its 
conceivable they could sell out however many they choose to make 
sudol and brady agreed that the viper should serve as a magnet 
in dealerships drawing in curious consumers who may end up buying 
something else 
thats already happened at lynn hickey dodge of oklahoma city 
general sales manager david slone said he said media reports of 
the car have boosted showroom traffic 
i know weve sold one daytona off it he said anything 
that piques the traffic is what we want anything that shows people 
that dodge is back in the performance business is good news 
a viper prototype was introduced last year at an annual auto 
show in detroit and drew huge crowds the twoseat convertible is a 
throwback to the era of sleek highpowered sports cars with few 
electronic gadgets 
the prototype has been part of a sixcity tour this spring 
during which chrysler executives have touted the quality of the 
companys vehicles comparing them favorably with those made by 
japanese automakers the tour ends friday in los angeles

an aggressive expansion plan at 
american airlines shows little sign of slowing despite a first 
quarter loss and concerns over increasing fuel costs and contract 
negotiations with pilots 
thats how it should be say most analysts who see current 
weaknesses as an investment in future strength 
stockholders seem to agree there was nothing on the agenda of 
todays annual meeting to indicate dissatisfaction with amr corp 
americans parent company 
chairman robert l crandall is scheduled to report on the events 
of 1989 that included a aborted takeover attempt by donald trump 
and the end of record quarterly profits 
i think its a situation where if the company were stagnant 
that might help profits in the very short run but it would be 
detrimental in the long run said jessica tully an airline 
industry analyst at the eppler guerin amp turner brokerage in dallas 
illustrating amrs growth strategy the company is upgrading its 
international service and announced the plan less than a week 
after it reported a 193 million first quarter loss 
americans international flagship service featuring french 
wine plush seats fresh linens and haute cuisine is part of a 
21 billion fiveyear expansion program the carrier will spend 
about 14 billion on new aircraft and about 6 billion on terminal 
facilities and other items spokesman al becker said tuesday 
the company has orders or options for 500 planes through 1994 
many intended to serve overseas markets and help reduce the fleets 
average age to less than 9 years the newer more efficient planes 
should help american contain rising fuel costs better than its 
rivals analysts say 
the expansion follows seven years during which american doubled 
in size to become the no 1 us carrier it has put american in 
position to gain from the faltering of such weaker rivals as pan 
american world airways and trans world airlines 
they are financially stronger and this is an industry where 
the strong are getting stronger said analyst samuel buttrick of 
kidder peabody amp co american is distancing itself from the 
pack 
one result however has been depressed earnings due to 
expansion costs plus higher fuel and labor expenses 
amrs first quarter loss compared with a profit of 1567 
million in the same period a year earlier for all of 1989 profits 
were down nearly 45 percent from the previous year to 4548 
million 
we expect that 1990 will be a difficult year as a result of 
high fuel prices weak traffic and downward pressure on yield 
crandall said in the companys annual report 
however we believe the company has great longterm 
strength and for that reason i remain optimistic about the 
prospects for amr in the years ahead 
amr stock closed at 66 a share tuesday well below its high for 
the past year of 10725 in the midst of trumps takeover try 
there has been little sign of shareholder dissatisfaction despite 
the decline however 
trump criticized amrs refusal to pay a dividend and its low

in an attempt to deter increasingly crafty 
shoplifters a growing number of clothing stores are turning to a 
sort of doomsday device a tag that if tampered with squirts the 
garment with an indelible dye 
the theory sometimes you have to ruin a dress to save it 
if thieves know they cant sell it and they cant wear it 
then they wont steal it says don barnett whose company makes 
colortag one of two such products on the market 
the other is called inktag and heres how it works 
you the shoplifter are strolling through a department store 
when you see an anne klein cream linen suit for 515 that you must 
have 
you notice a white plastic disc about two inches in diameter 
clamped on the skirt like a sandwich it bears this warning 
forcing tag open causes breakage permanent ink sprays out injury 
can occur from broken glass metal and ink 
since grenades are not customarily attached to dresses you 
disregard the warning anyway you figure you can always remove 
the disc in the safety of your own home so you take it into the 
dressing room stuff it into your purse and head for the exit 
you step out of the store exultant but when you get the dress 
home and try to pry the disc off with a screwdriver your hands are 
suddenly squirted with blue red and yellow ink that also stains 
the dress 
the stain wears off your hands in a few days but repeated trips 
to the dry cleaner fail to eradicate the dress spot you cant wear 
it anywhere except to halloween parties and the hipper downtown 
clubs 
three vials inside the disctag were rigged to break when it 
did releasing three teaspoons of a biological stain that 
interacts with the cells of natural fibers so it cant be washed 
out according to robert dilonardo of security tag systems in st 
petersburg fla which makes inktag 
if the garment had been purchased the tag would have been 
cleanly removed by a sales clerk with a small device bolted down 
next to the cash register 
dilonardo said his company has sold several hundred thousand 
tags to 40 stores since production began last fall colortag says 
its product on sale for two years now is used in hundreds of 
stores 
michael myers vice president of security for the casual corner 
chain of womens clothing stores says colortag has reduced losses 
by about 60 percent at the 40 stores where they have been tried he 
described the reduction as incredible and said the company 
plans to order more 
a quarter century ago stores began tagging merchandise with 
magnetic strips and installing detectors at the door but store 
security officials say professional shoplifters who account for 
about 85 percent of all shoplifts have learned how to remove the 
tags in the store and to shield them from the detector on the way 
out 
meanwhile shoplifting is soaring annual estimated losses 
exceed 25 billion and one study found that shoplifters escape 
with the goods 97 percent of the time 
the ink tag concept originated in sweden and has been used in 
europe for six years store security consultant peter berlin says 
that since such tags are more expensive than magnetic ones 
inktags cost about 275 each they may be better suited for 
smaller clothing stores 
but berlin says the tags appear to be effective despite the 
label warning there is no explosion when the vials break and 
little chance of accidents it really has to be abused before it 
breaks said dilonardo 
sometimes however clerks forget to remove the tags from 
purchased items dilonardo said one woman brought her wedding dress 
home and found the tag still attached despite the warning her 
fiance insisted he could get it off he did and she had to walk 
down the aisle in another dress

nordstrom inc leaders fended off 
charges of unfair labor practices and said they see no reason to 
change the way the upscale retail chain does business 
long noted for its sterling service nordstrom faces labor 
grievances and a union classaction lawsuit filed on behalf of 
approximately 100000 employees 
the companys shareholders contend in a separate suit that 
nordstrom should have revealed the extent of its labor problems 
which will be costly to resolve 
but nordstrom cochairman bruce nordstrom told shareholders at 
the retailers annual meeting tuesday the company has concluded 
that only recordkeeping changes are required to address the labor 
grievances 
not only does the system work it also is fair and just 
nordstrom said 
union leader joe peterson clad in a tuxedo for the meeting at 
the posh four seasons hotel said labor violations were systematic 
and could cost nordstrom up to 300 million in back pay and 
damages he said the union would fight for years if necessary to 
get employees the money 
this dispute is not going to end peterson head of the 
united food amp commercial workers union local 1001 told reporters 
before the meeting the company needs to sit down and find 
reasonable solutions to this problem 
bruce nordstrom and his cousins james and john nordstrom told 
reporters the company set aside 15 million last year to cover the 
cost of the labor dispute 
they said they expect to settle many of the labor complaints 
but added they also expect the union will file more to keep 
pressure on the company 
with 26 billion in annual sales seattlebased nordstrom calls 
itself the nations largest independently owned specialty fashion 
chain its reputation for service was polished over decades and is 
practiced at 60 stores in washington oregon california alaska 
virginia and utah 
nordstrom officials attribute the high level of service to the 
companys incentive system 
to inspire a will to succeed among its employees the latest 
annual report says the company adopted a commission pay 
structure that rewards the salespeople for their fine efforts 
but in its lawsuit the union representing washington nordstrom 
workers says those policies force employees to work unpaid hours 
stocking shelves make deliveries on days off cart merchandise 
from one store to another do inventory work at home and skip 
lunches and coffee breaks 
the union collected about 600 complaints from california 
nordstrom workers and about 600 more from workers in other states 
most claims contend employees worked four to 10 hours per week 
without pay averaging about 4000 per year in lost wages 
nordstrom maintains the union stirred up complaints about back 
pay after contract negotiations reached an impasse the last 
contract expired july 31 
the company now insists that union membership no longer be 
mandatory in washington 
how much the labor woes have affected consumer confidence in 
nordstrom is in debate 
the company said this month that its firstquarter profits were 
off 43 percent at 132 million the nordstroms attributed the 
decline almost entirely to problems with inventory the northern 
california quake that devastated a big store and price cutting 
throughout the industry

highyield junk bonds and circle k has struggled under the debt 
which required annual interest payments of 100 million 
in april circle k said its largest stockholder 
cincinnatibased american financial corp and an 11member 
consortium of creditor banks gave it seven months to come up with a 
plan to restructure its debt 
the company said today it was still negotiating on a socalled 
standstill agreement that would provide for the deferring for 
all principal and interest payment through oct 31 
the company lost more than 28 million in the three months that 
ended jan 31 
circle k is the secondlargest convenience store chain after 
7eleven operated by southland corp of dallas southland which 
was taken private in a leveraged buyout in 1987 also was unable to 
pay its debts and was forced to sell a controlling interest to a 
partner in the buyout itoyokado co ltd of japan 
the two convenience store retailers are among the growing number 
of companies that have been overwhelmed by debt following buyouts 
or expansions campeau corps department store divisions and ames 
department stores inc also have been forced into bankruptcy court 
circle k has faced growing competition from 24hour supermarkets 
and rival gasoline dealers about 42 percent of circle ks gross 
revenues in fiscal 1989 came from gasoline sales

shareholders defeated a proposal calling 
for upjohn co to sever south african ties but the pharmaceutical 
company said it may sell one of its two south african plants 
because of poor sales 
upjohn president theodore cooper said at tuesdays annual 
meeting he hopes a buyer is found by summer for asgrow sa which 
develops vegetable seeds and employs about 100 people 
upjohn doesnt plan to phase out its other south african 
subsidiary the upjohn ltd pharmaceutical firm as long as it 
meets the companys social objectives and business objectives 
cooper said 
at present the board believes the companys continued 
presence in south africa is justified he said 
shareholders also rejected a proposal to institute confidential 
shareholder votes also opposed by the companys directors 
cooper had opened last years annual meeting by denying rumors 
that the pharmaceutical giant was for sale and opened tuesdays 
meeting by saying that stance is the same despite an industry trend 
toward consolidation 
and you can see we did not sell it in the last year nor do 
we intend to sell it in the future he said 
he said upjohn is looking at possible projects in the soviet 
union and looking for new markets for drugs such as its rogaine 
baldness treatment and xanax antianxiety drug 
upjohn reported net earnings of 176 million on net sales of 
291 billion in 1989

strategic alliances once referred to the common 
market opec nato and the warsaw pact but now they also mean 
getungsram ibmsiemens and daimlermitsubishi 
international corporate joint ventures the latest trend in a 
shrinking world are redefining economic strengths and increasingly 
eroding the importance of national boundaries in business 
more than a dozen joint ventures have been announced in the past 
six months some between giant rivals others between the strong 
and meek to a large degree they reflect the inability of any one 
company regardless how rich to compete in the world marketplace 
without help from a partner 
the latest catalyst for many joint ventures seems to be a desire 
to exploit enormous changes in europe 
the 12nation common market is eliminating internal trade 
barriers in 1992 creating what amounts to the biggest single 
market of affluent consumers anywhere in eastern europe many 
businesses are beckoning western partners after four decades of 
nowrepudiated communist control 
despite the creative powers harnessed by joint ventures they 
pose problems that ultimately conflict with national sovereignty 
experts say 
for example it could be more difficult for governments to 
regulate and tax the companies involved joint ventures also may 
make it harder to determine who builds what products complicating 
enforcement of trade quotas and tariffs 
what nationality for example is a car with a chrysler 
nameplate designed jointly by chrysler and mitsubishi and built by 
americans at a joint chryslermitsubishi plant in illinois 
the alliances also have raised concerns about concentration of 
industrial power such as the plans by daimlerbenz west germanys 
largest industrial group to form joint ventures with the 
mitsubishi companies japaneses largest industrial conglomerate 
that announcement also raised the specter of a resurrected world 
war ii alliance daimlerbenz and mitsubishi armed the axis 
another concern is that some venture partners may be mismatched 
the economist magazine recently editorialized that participants 
could spend the rest of the 20th century unraveling a tangle of 
reckless marriages 
many alliances are essentially defensive moves by sluggards to 
resist nimbler competitors the magazine said if a firm cannot 
compete it is probably doomed no matter how many dancing partners 
it has signed up 
among alliances announced in recent months 
international business machines corp the worlds largest 
computer maker will develop computer memory chips with siemens ag 
west germanys largest electronics company 
american telephone amp telegraph co and nec corp the huge 
japanese electronics company will make semiconductors and 
cooperate on other computer technologies 
general motors corp the worlds largest automaker bought a 
halfinterest in carmaking operations of swedens saabscania ab 
chrysler corp and austrian automaker steyrdaimlerpuch ag 
will make chryslers minivans in austria 
ab volvo of sweden and renault the french govermentowned 
automaker will buy stakes in each other and engage in joint 
research product development and purchasing 
general electric co entered into one of the largest deals in 
east europe by buying control of the hungarian light bulb maker 
tungsram 
many joint ventures of the past few months depart from the 
historical model said stephen j kobrin professor of management 
at the university of pennsylvanias wharton school 
previously he said a joint venture was viewed as a foothold 
abroad it typically involved a multinational company taking a 
stake in a local firm that would provide market access 
but many ventures are alliances between multinationals often 
competitors in which they agree to jointly work on a new 
technology or share product development costs 
i think whats driving a lot of them is technology kobrin 
said the complexity of technology is such that even huge 
leadingedge firms dont have all the knowledge and skills they 
need to deal with it 
moreover he said the amount of money is so huge that a 
prudent private firm wouldnt want to do it on its own you cant 
afford one failure 
corporations cant support the necessary research by selling in 
just a few markets said david wyss an economist with the research 
firm drimcgraw hill 
however stephen chazen a mergers and acquisitions banker with 
merrill lynch amp co said he believes access to foreign markets is 
the overriding reason for most of these ventures 
they take the cheapest approach which is to make some sort of 
deal he said 
wyss said joint ventures have gained popularity as international 
buyout activity has slowed due to increasingly tight credit 
conditions which makes borrowing money for takeovers more 
expensive he predicted the jointventure trend will continue for 
some time 
we are moving much more toward a global economy those 
companies that cant participate globally are going to be 
restricted to areas where they can compete which means relatively 
lowtechnology sectors he said 
but wyss said some of these joint ventures may not have been 
well thoughtout 
some companies are sort of panicking at being squeezed out of 
these markets so theyre finding someone to jump into bed with 
that doesnt necessarily make for good longterm relations he 
said 
kobrin said the alliances pose another problem 
the primary concern with a lot of strategic alliances is 
youre often dealing with a direct competitor youre worried about 
keeping your core technology to yourself he said and that 
doesnt lead to true cooperation 
the joint ventures involving japanese companies are of 
particular concern wyss said japanese companies have a history of 
exporting technology from the united states and europe to japan 
they also have established a pattern of eventually taking over 
joint ventures by buying out their partners 
eastern europe presents another booming area for joint ventures 
for major corporations besides the ge hungarian deal general 
motors plans to make cars under a venture with an east german 
concern siemens said it will make industrial robots with an east 
german counterpart and japans suzuki motor co plans to build cars 
with a hungarian firm 
any business that aspires to be a global business cant for 
too long ignore a new market of that size and promise said paul 
lawrence a professor at the harvard business school 
for the reformist east european governments joint ventures 
are a critical part of their whole economic reform program 
lawrence said 
as jointventure agreements transcend national boundaries 
governments may be forced to devise new ways to police them 
in the long run it means that countries are going to more 
closely coordinate tax laws because as companies become more 
multinational theyre going to gain a greater ability to tax shop 
across national borders wyss said 
kobrin said governments also may seek restrictions on joint 
ventures that risk spreading technology considered proprietary but 
he said that thinking may be outdated 
technology is inherently international he said i wonder 
if in eight or 10 or 12 years youll be able to talk about national 
products or national technologies

blacks were rejected more than twice as often 
as whites for home loans in the first half of 1989 a treasury 
department official testified wednesday 
from the second half of 1988 to the first half of 1989 the 
rejection rate for blacks rose from 23 percent to 29 percent 
jerauld c kluckman told a senate banking subcommittee 
during the same period the rejection rate for whites rose from 
11 percent to 13 percent kluckman told the subcommittee on 
consumer and regulatory affairs the panel is examining 
discrimination in the mortgage lending industry 
kluckman director of compliance programs at the office of 
thrift supervision said the agency is concerned about these 
changes however he cautioned against drawing too many 
conclusions from the data 
the differences in rejection rates in and of themselves do 
not indicate that savings associations are discriminating on a 
prohibited basis he said for example the data in their present 
state do not consider creditworthiness or the criteria set by 
lenders 
the significance of the differences cannot be ignored but can 
only be explored and explained through vigorous field examinations 
that thoroughly analyze a given savings associations policies 
procedures lending programs and critera he said 
kluckman was one of several government witnesses at the hearing 
which was called by sen alan dixon dill kluckmans office 
which regulates the savings and loan industry was the only witness 
to have detailed data on refusals 
the number of witnesses reflected the number of entities 
involved in enforcing laws against lending discrimination 
comptroller of the currency housing and urban development federal 
deposit insurance corp and federal reserve 
dixon and others expressed surprise that despite statistics 
showing such a wide gap between loan approvals for blacks and 
whites not one case had been referred to the justice department 
witnesses said violations have been handled through 
administrative channels 
assistant housing secretary gordon h mansfield said that 
situation could change we are currently consulting with justice 
in one case he said 
other reports have indicated a pattern of discrimination in 
mortgage lending a series of stories published by the the atlanta 
constitution in 1988 showed that highincome blacks were rejected 
more often than highincome whites 
kluckman said the justice department had written 64 atlantaarea 
lending institutions in the last year requesting information on 
lending standards policies and practices as well as other data

earnings for the nations 500 largest service 
companies dropped 123 percent in 1989 but it still was their 
second most profitable year ever fortune magazine said in an 
annual ranking released wednesday 
the report attributed the decline for the fortune service 500 to 
drops in profitability among the biggest commercial banking thrift 
and retailing businesses 
the drop might have been worse had the diversified service 
companies and the diversified financial companies not done the 
heavy lifting the magazine wrote in an article about the 
rankings that appear in its june 4 issue 
profits at the diversified service group which includes 
companies ranging from movie studios to waste processors more than 
doubled from a year ago and rose nearly 121 percent for 
diversified financial services 
fortune said the 500 biggest service companies earned a combined 
697 billion in 1989 down from a revised 795 billion a year 
earlier 
the 1988 figure originally was reported at 738 billion but was 
revised upward because the magazine has begun including net income 
for life insurers 
fortunes 34th annual service 500 survey indicated profits 
tumbled 60 percent to nearly 7 billion at the 100 largest 
commercial banking companies while the 50 largest savings 
institutions had a combined loss of 31 billion in contrast to a 
profit of 12 billion a year earlier 
the magazine said bad real estate loans and too many junk bonds 
left banks and thrifts pretty winded 
profits dropped 455 percent to nearly 5 billion at the 50 
biggest retailing companies which the magazine wrote were 
hobbled by both cautious consumer spending and their own suicidal 
price wars 
the 50 biggest transportation companies also showed a profit 
decline dropping 147 percent to 467 billion in what the 
magazine said reflected a bumpy ride among the major airlines 
in the plus column the 100 biggest diversified service 
companies posted a combined profit of 141 billion more than 
double the 634 billion earned a year earlier 
profits rose 121 percent to 141 billion at the 50 largest 
diversified financial companies 76 percent to 61 billion at the 
50 biggest life insurance companies and 15 percent to 219 
billion at the 50 biggest utilities 
american telephone amp telegraph which led the diversified 
services companies in sales with 363 billion earned 27 
billion its best showing since the bell system breakup five years 
earlier 
ranking behind new yorkbased atampt in sales were the wholesale 
foods distributors fleming cos of oklahoma city and super valu 
stores of eden prairie minn 
the top three commercial banking companies remained citicorp and 
chase manhattan corp both of new york and bankamerica corp of

there also were no changes in the top three spots among the 
diversified financial companies american express co of new york 
was followed by the federal national mortgage association of 
washington dc and salomon inc the new york securities firm 
hf ahmanson of los angeles remained the topranked savings

mobil corp one of the major producers of 
plastic grocery bags said wednesday it will begin collecting and 
recycling used bags from supermarkets across the country 
the oil giants mobil chemical co unit annually manufactures 
over 5 billion of the 23 billion bags used by the nations grocery 
stores mobil said it will recycle the bags into plastic sacks and 
other products made of polyethylene such as plastic garbage cans 
the first stores to participate in the program will be 244 
safeway markets in california nevada and hawaii which will begin 
collecting bags sometime next month said greg auth business 
manager of mobils grocery bags 
other chains are expected to join in as consumer concern over 
the environment continues to mount 
mobil the nations secondlargest oil company and sonoco 
products co manufacture more than half of the nations plastic 
grocery bags sonoco said it collects bags from 1500 supermarkets 
around the country the bags are then sold to a separate company 
for use in plastic tubing 
mobil chemical spokesman john lord said the compnay will begin 
making presentations to all our customers in the coming weeks 
we expect strong suport from supermarket chains across country 
he said 
the use of plastic grocery bags has mushroomed in less than a 
decade in 1982 just 5 percent of all grocery sacks were made of 
plastic today the figure is roughly 60 percent as more and more 
supermarkets and shopkeepers opt for plastic bags which are 
inexpensive strong and take up onetenth the space of their 
brownpaper counterparts 
lord said legislation pending in a number of municipalities that 
would ban the use of plastic bags contributed to mobils move to 
set up the program even though plastic grocery sacks contribute 
very small volumes to the total waste stream 
the key to the programs success will be consumer participation 
not only must consumers bring used bags to the supermarkets but 
the bags must be clean auth said dirty bags cannot be recycled as 
easily and it is time consuming to remove them from recycling bins 
the bags will be recycled at four mobil plants that handle 
polyethylene products the company said its researchers are 
stepping up efforts to develop products that can contain greater 
amounts of recycled materials

the bankruptcy trustee for the delaware amp 
hudson railway has accepted a 25 million bid for the carrier from 
canadian pacific ltd in a deal that drew praise wednesday from 
both companies 
under the agreement canadian pacific will either run the 
delaware amp hudson or underwrite its operation by trustee francis p 
dicello dicello has been overseeing its operation since february 
while trying to sell the freight line which runs from montreal to 
washington and from albany to buffalo ny 
the delaware amp hudson the nations oldest continuously operated 
railroad filed in june 1988 for chapter 11 protection from its 
creditors it is about 100 million in debt 
we believe that the selection of canadian pacific will provide 
jobs for employees and ensure continued viable rail service and 
that the price negotiated with other considerations provide a basis 
upon which a reorganization plan can be negotiated with a fair 
return to creditors said delaware amp hudson president cp belke 
canadian pacific which owns 14000 miles of track in canada and 
5000 in the us said the sale was an investment opportunity in 
light of relaxed trade barriers between the united states and 
canada 
certainly under the free trade agreement we can see some 
major benefits said spokesman john cox it allows us to 
operate one of the largest market segments in the northeast 
a hearing on the proposed sale is scheduled for june 7 in 
bankruptcy court in wilmington del the sale is subject to 
approval by federal and state authorities and the delaware amp 
hudsons labor unions 
canadian pacifics 25 million bid is 10 million less than it 
offered earlier this year the carrier withdrew that bid feb 13 
when it was unable to negotiate with consolidated rail corp to 
secure track rights between hagerstown md and harrisburg pa 
conrail toughed it out and just wouldnt budge so theyre 
going to do the deal without it and compete in other arenas said 
charles white an attorney working with dicello to sell the line 
the proposed deal includes rolling stock 600 miles of track and 
an additional 900 miles to which the railroad has running rights 
the agreement also allows the trustee to sell easements for 
fiberoptic cables along the delaware amp hudson rightsofway white 
said he said the rights are worth about 5 million

the dollar closed mostly lower on world currency 
markets wednesday in light trading 
gold prices retreated after rising overseas on the commodity 
exchange in new york gold bullion for current delivery settled at 
369 a troy ounce off 190 from late tuesday republic national 
bank in new york quoted a late bid for gold at 36905 an ounce 
down 120 
traders said the dollar was barely affected by fresh government 
data pointing to slow economic growth and moderate inflation the 
government said consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 02 
percent in april while housing starts were down a 
largerthanexpected 58 percent 
the figures were enough to weaken the dollar but it has not 
gone down that much said earl johnson a vice president at 
harris trust and savings bank in chicago 
there was a feeling in the market that the dollar had bottomed 
out for the time being traders said some noted that they were 
unable to push the dollar below 150 japanese yen which proved to 
be a formidable barrier johnson said 
most market participants were awaiting thursdays release of 
merchandise trade data for march to confirm their suspicions that 
the dollar is headed lower the expectation is for a deficit of 
between 77 billion and 85 billion februarys deficit totaled 
649 billion 
a large deficit is negative for the dollar when the united 
states imports more than it exports it diminishes the need for 
dollars by foreigners to purchase us goods but over time a weak 
dollar helps the trade picture by making us goods more 
competitive overseas 
still some traders were predicting little reaction whatever the 
trade report bears because all the bad news has already been 
built in said kevin lawrie vice president and manager of the 
bank of bostons new york office 
earlier in tokyo the dollar closed at 15195 japanese yen up 
from 15130 yen tuesday later in london the dollar traded lower

a steep hike in health care costs was a major 
contributor to a modest rise in inflation last month the 
government said wednesday 
overall consumers received their first break since a cold snap 
sent prices soaring at the beginning of the year but that news was 
tempered by the fact that health care costs skyrocketed 08 percent 
in april it was the third increase at that level according to the 
labor departments consumer price index 
health care costs were up 89 percent from a year ago 
the government said declines in the cost of vegetables fuel oil 
and womens clothing offset the higher healthcare costs to restrain 
the overall increase the rise in the consumer price index was held 
to a seasonally adjuted 02 percent in april the most modest gain 
in seven months 
were correcting from the unusually high prices of the 
winter said economist donald ratajczak of georgia state 
university in atlanta you could argue the worst of inflation 
is behind us certainly for this year 
the index spurred by weatherrelated increases in food and 
energy prices soared 11 percent in january and climbed 05 
percent in february and march 
the earlier price spurt along with a burst of economic activity 
fueled by unseasonably warm weather following the freeze had 
persuaded many analysts that the economy was breaking free of the 
sluggishness of late 1989 
however the latest inflation report fits with recent 
employment retail sales and industrial production figures that 
show a return to slow growth in april 
separately wednesday the commerce department said new housing 
construction fell sharply for the third month in a row plummeting 
58 percent in april to the lowest level since the 1982 recession 
the economy has not fundamentally changed it remains weak and 
inflation is not a threat we expect more of that to come said 
david a levy of levy economic forecasts in chappaqua ny 
interest rates reacting to the evidence of quiescent inflation 
and anemic economic growth inched lower in early trading on the 
bond market and stocks rose slightly both markets however 
quickly reversed and analysts were at a loss to explain 
some suggested that market participants were looking beyond the 
april inflation figure to the fact that inflation for the first 
four months of the year was running at a 68 percent annual rate 
up from 46 percent for all of 1989 
in april food and beverage prices fell 02 percent the first 
decline since july 1987 nonalcoholic beverage and dairy product 
prices were down while prices rose for cereal and bakery products 
beef pork sweets and oils 
fresh vegetable prices which rose 292 percent in the first two 
months of the year fell 155 percent last month bringing the 
decline for march and april to 198 percent 
energy prices dropped 04 percent after declining the two 
previous months gasoline prices with the start of the warm 
weather driving season climbed 03 percent and electricty costs 
were up 02 percent however fuel oil fell 06 percent the third 
consecutive decline while natural gas dropped 30 percent 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices rose a 
moderate 02 percent after increasing a worrisome 07 percent in 
march economists said that core number was often a better 
indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy 
new automobile prices fell 02 percent in april clothing price 
inflation moderated from a month earlier apparel prices overall 
were unchanged after rising 17 percent in march 
womens and girls clothing costs fell 05 percent however 
mens and boys clothing costs were up 04 percent while infants 
and toddlers costs rose 19 percent 
the various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 
1289 in april that means a hypothetical selection of goods that 
cost 100 in the 198284 base period cost 12890 last month up 
from 12310 a year earlier 
separately the labor department said americans average weekly 
earnings after adjusting for inflation increased 02 percent last 
month however over the past year real weekly earnings were down 
17 percent 
so far this year wholesale prices as measured by the producer 
price index have recovered from the winter weather shocks much more 
swiftly than consumer prices as a result wholesale prices for the 
first four months of the year have risen at a more moderate annual 
rate of 42 percent 
analysts attribute the slower recovery of consumer prices to the 
heavy influence of the service sector which accounts for slightly 
more than 50 percent of the consumer index and none of the 
wholesale index 
the economic slowdown of recent months has slowed demand for 
goods pulling down wholesale costs but until very recently it 
hadnt affected employment

pork futures prices soared wednesday after a report showed an 
unexpected drop in pork belly stocks sparking speculation that the 
hog and belly markets will resume a sizzling rally that suffered a 
setback last week 
on other commodity markets cattle futures also advanced cocoa 
and coffee futures surged precious metals retreated oil futures 
were mixed and grains and soybeans were mixed 
hog futures settled 25 cents to the permitted daily limit of 
15 cents higher on the chicago mercantile exchange with the 
contract for delivery in june at 65 cents a pound 
frozen pork belly futures ended 147 cents to the limit 2 cents 
higher with may at 6422 cents a pound 
in cattle futures trading on the merc live cattle settled 15 
cent to 87 cent higher with june at 7442 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were unchanged to 63 cent higher with may at 8475 cents a 
pound 
analysts said the cattle rally reflected spillover buying 
enthusiasm from the adjacent pork pits 
pork futures generally have been in an upward trend since late 
february partly due to a decline in hog slaughters that defied 
normal seasonal patterns 
wednesdays rally appeared to be rooted in the mercs weekly 
report tuesday on belly stocks in commercial freezers outside of 
chicago the report showed a net decline of 199000 pounds instead 
of the expected increase of up to 15 million pounds 
the report was startling according to charles levitt senior 
livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
i dont recall it ever having occurred he said 
pork bellies are the part of a hog from which bacon is made but 
with hog slaughters declining on a yeartoyear basis levitt said 
meat packers also are using bellies in hot dogs and pork sausages 
meanwhile rising hog prices have made it profitable for 
producers to fatten up their animals a bit more before marketing 
them which is contributing to the slower slaughter pace analysts 
said 
hog prices normally reach an annual peak in midsummer 
tom morgan president of sterling research corp said market 
sentiment is divided between those who think the rally already is 
at or near its peak and those who believe hog futures will exceed 
the record high of 68 cents a pound reached on aug 20 1982 
those people sure came out of the woodwork today morgan 
said 
cocoa futures climbed to their highest levels in nearly 14 
months on new yorks coffee sugar and cocoa exchange amid news of 
new antigovernment protests by soldiers in the ivory coast the 
worlds largest cocoa producer 
cocoa settled 35 to 38 higher with the july contract at 1433 
per ton the highest settlement of a nearmonth cocoa contract 
since march 22 1989 
coffee futures also rose sharply in new york amid reports that 
colombia had moved to tighten coffee exports 
coffee settled 12 cents to 233 cents higher with may at 9363 
cents a pound 
inflationsensitive precious metal futures fell on new yorks 
commodity exchange after the government reported a moderate 02 
percent rise in consumer prices in april 
gold futures settled 190 to 240 lower with june at 37030 a 
troy ounce silver was 02 cent to 05 cent lower with may at 501 
a troy ounce 
energy futures were mixed in fairly heavy trading on the new 
york mercantile exchange with prices of nearterm crude oil 
deliveries tumbling and unleaded gasoline gaining ground 
the action followed tuesdays weekly american petroleum 
institute stocks report showing an unexpected rise in us crude 
stocks and a surprising drop in gasoline supplies 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 56 cents lower to 04 
cent higher with june at 1903 a barrel heating oil was 05 cent 
to 23 cent lower with june at 5163 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 35 cent lower to 66 cent higher with june at 6417

selloff but corn futures retreated extending the steep losses

problems ranging from government 
interference to rising fuel and labor costs threaten to slow growth 
of the worlds airline industry and raise fares the head of the 
largest us carrier said wednesday 
we must keep in mind that if the many factors pushing up our 
costs are not restrained they may have the effect of pushing up 
prices sufficiently to curb the demand on which our future 
depends robert l crandall chairman of amr corp told 
stockholders at the companys annual meeting amr is the parent of 
american airlines 
other challenges cited by crandall were the need for new 
equipment and terminals and tougher standards for safety and 
efficiency 
crandall said fares would have to rise to pay the bill for 
meeting the industrys various challenges 
we must charge fares to give us sufficient revenue to pay for 
the airplanes pay for the facilities pay for increases in 
compensation that our people want pay for the improved maintenance 
procedures pay for all of the improved things that people want 
from the airline system crandall told reporters later 
american is pushing an international expansion program but 
crandall said foreign governments control of landing rights make 
it difficult to crack those markets 
domestically we are also bedeviled by a shortage of airspace 
and airport capacity a problem that has been with us for far too 
long crandall said as a result we have too few controllers 
too few airports inefficient airspace management and inadequate 
planning for the future he added 
as for the future of amr itself crandall declined to forecast 
when the company would begin to benefit from a 21 billion 
fiveyear expansion plan or whether the companys financial 
performance would improve this year 
amr reported a 193 million loss in the first quarter of 1990 
its first loss in more than two years the loss followed two 
quarters of lower earnings 
we very consciously avoid making any specific forecast 
crandall said 
during the meeting stockholders reelected the companys 
directors and rejected three shareholders resolutions that would 
set minimum stock ownership requirements for directors changed the 
way shares are counted in directors elections and allowed 
confidential voting by shareholders

letteringmachine maker kroy inc and a european 
subsidiary have filed a rare prepackaged reorganization proposal 
the company says will avoid the death spiral delays typical of 
such filings 
the chapter 11 petition in federal bankruptcy court seeking 
protection from creditors while allowing kroy to continue to 
operate lists assets of 50 million and liabilities of 53 million 
it includes kroy europe ltd and has the approval of some of its 
major creditors the company said wednesday in announcing its 
filing 
it also proposes sale of a substantial portion of its equity to 
minneapolisbased red oak investments kroy said a smaller portion 
will be sold to kroys existing equity security holders no details 
were disclosed 
kroy president howard klemmer said the scottsdalebased company 
ran into a cashflow problem after it incurred a 60 million debt 
in a 1986 leveraged buyout by its management 
operating profits have had to be funneled into debt payment he 
said producing a severe cash flow problem limiting research 
development and marketing 
klemmer said the prepackaged bankruptcy technique is relatively 
new and allows the court to view documents and confirm the 
reorganization plan in the shortest period of time usually the 
plan is submitted to the court months after the initial filing 
typically what would happen in a chapter 11 case is the 
company files for protection and goes through 120 days where they 
file a reorganization plan klemmer said people lose faith in 
the company employees become discouraged and the company suffers 
its a death spiral 
the arizona biltmore a phoenix resort filed a prepackaged 
reorganization plan in february and had it approved a month later 
kroy said its approval was likely to take longer because the 
company hadnt yet reached agreement with all its creditors 
klemmer took over kroy in october in attempt to dig the company 
out of its financial problems 
the company which has 120 employees at its scottsdale 
headquarters was sued last year by the us department of labor 
for hurting its employee stockownership plan with the buyout the 
reorganization plan addresses that issue as well klemmer said 
kroy was formed as united fabricators and electronics inc in 
1963 as a spinoff from plastics corp of america in 1969 it 
changed its name to kroy and began selling lettering machines in 
1973 along with a wide variety of labeling lettering and other 
printing products 
it has 400 dealers and distributors worldwide

a federal appeals court ruling likely will 
crimp regulators ability to save the government money when a bank 
owned by a holding company fails attorneys said wednesday 
the decision by the us court of appeals in new orleans 
challenges the federal reserve boards source of strength 
doctrine which required holding companies to pump money into banks 
they owned if the institutions weakened 
the court said the fed had no authority to force mcorp a 
dallasbased bank holding company to inject capital into 20 
banking subsidiaries that later failed 
regulators declared the 20 subsidiaries insolvent in march 1989 
leaving mcorp with five solvent banks the estimated cost of 
bailing out depositors at the failed banks is 2 billion making it 
the secondlargest commercial bank rescue ever 
stephen verdier an attorney with the independent bankers 
association of america said the ruling in effect makes oneway 
barriers of the firewall restrictions between a bank and its 
holding company 
bank profits can be transferred in the normal course of business 
to the holding company but if the bank gets in trouble the 
holding company now will be able to choose whether to support the 
bank or let it fail and have federal deposit insurance pay the 
bill he said 
i think the regulators have a problem said verdier whose 
organization represents smaller community banks in theory a 
bank could upstream its profits to the holding company and then 
later on the bank could fail and the holding company and its 
nonbank affiliates could wash their hands 
the fed in policy directives in 1984 and 1987 had said a 
bank holding company shall serve as source of financial and 
managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and should stand 
ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds 
to subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or 
adversity 
however the appeals court said congress granted the fed 
authority to issue capital directives only to banks not to their 
holding companies 
it is not our role to pass judgment on the wisdom of the 
scheme congress put in place to regulate bank holding companies 
similarly the board cannot exceed the authority congress granted 
to correct perceived flaws in the congressional scheme judge w 
eugene davis who wrote the decision for the threejudge appeals 
panel 
ruling in the feds favor would require mcorp to disregard its 
own corporations separate status and amount to a 
violation of its duty to its shareholders davis said 
attorney james mclaughlin of the american bankers association 
said the ruling puts stockholders in bank holding companies on the 
same footing as shareholders in other financial services companies 
it should help bank holding companies attract investors he said 
from a broad policy perspective its necessary to provide the 
incentives to get capital in there to bank holding companies 
mclaughlin said 
congress had considered explicitly enacting the 
sourceofstrength doctrine into law as part of sampl bailout 
legislation passed last summer however it rejected that and 
adopted a provision requiring banks but not the holding company 
itself to help the government bail out affiliate banks 
verdier predicted congress would have to settle the 
sourceofstrength question next year when it considers legislation 
to reform the deposit insurance system and revamp the financial 
system 
the appeals court in releasing its ruling tuesday upheld a 
june 1989 decision by judge lynn n hughes of the us district 
court for the southern district of texas

a federal judge has refused to throw out charges 
against a psychiatrist accused of using confidential information 
from a patient to make a profitable stock deal involving 
bankamerica corp securities 
the decision tuesday by us district judge miriam cedarbaum 
revealed for the first time that the patient was the wife of 
primerica corp chief executive sanford i weill who was involved 
in a 1986 attempt to head bankamerica 
the indictment against the psychiatrist robert howard willis 
identified the patient only as jane doe 
willis is accused of using nonpublic information about weills 
negotiations with bankamerica obtained during consultations with 
joan weill to make a 27475 profit in transactions involving 
bankamerica stock 
the psychiatrist allegedly bought bankamerica stock between jan 
14 1986 and feb 6 1986 and then sold it after a public 
announcement on feb 21 1986 about weills attempts to become 
chief executive 
weill at the time was chief executive of the wall street firm 
shearson loeb rhoades since integrated into shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
weill was unsuccessful in his bid to join bankamerica neither 
weill nor bankamerica was charged with any wrongdoing 
the indictment filed last august charged willis with 23 counts 
of securities fraud and 23 counts of mail fraud 
willis 55 of tenafly nj has an office on manhattans upper 
east side 
cedarbaum rejected arguments by willis lawyers seeking to 
dismiss the securities fraud charges because willis had not been 
accused of breaching a duty to a market participant or to any 
participant in the corporate world 
by not advising his patient of his intention to disclose her 
confidential information and to profit personally from it dr 
willis fraudulently induced his patient to confide in him in 
connection with his purchase and sale of securities the judge 
said in a written opinion 
cedarbaum also dismissed new arguments raised by willis defense 
since an appeals court on may 2 reversed the securities fraud 
conviction of former stockbroker robert chestman 
in that decision the 2nd us circuit court of appeals found 
that chestman did not know that information he received about the 
imminent sale of the waldbaums supermarket chain was confidential 
when he traded on it 
dr willis knew that he was receiving the information in 
confidence and that by disclosing and using the information for 
his personal benefit he was breaching the duty of trust and 
confidence that he owed to his patient she said 
no trial date for willis has been set

ronald j jackson a former president and chief 
executive of kenner parker toys inc is returning to the toy 
business as chairman president and ceo of fisherprice officials 
announced wednesday 
jackson is leaving as president and chief executive officer of 
stride rite corp of cambridge mass to take the new post 
his appointment to the top job at fisherprice became effective 
immediately said the toymakers parent company quaker oats co 
chicagobased quaker last month announced plans to spin 
fisherprice off to its shareholders as an independent company 
fisherprice is the worlds biggest maker of infant and 
preschool toys and is based in east aurora ny the business 
suffered an 11 percent drop in operating income during the fiscal 
year that ended last june and had an operating loss of about 25 
million in the most recent quarter 
toy industry analysts have blamed fisherprices problems on a 
costly poorly planned attempt to develop toys for older children 
quaker chairman william d smithburg expressed confidence 
jackson can turn the company around 
ron jacksons background as a toy company executive and 
especially his experience in heading a newly independent publicly 
traded kenner parker toys from 1985 to 1987 makes him ideally 
suited to lead fisherprice during this very important period 
smithburg said in a statement 
quaker has said it hopes to complete a taxfree distribution of 
fisherprice stock to quaker shareholders by the first quarter of 
1991 
jackson 46 said the appointment represented a great 
opportunity 
i know from experience how highly regarded fisherprice is in 
the toy industry and despite its recent performance this company 
has what it takes to bounce back and succeed he said in a 
statement 
paul e price a senior vice president of quaker who served as 
interim president of fisherprice since january will return to his 
duties at quaker smithburg said 
jackson worked for parker brothers and its parent general mills 
inc from 1974 to 1985 when he left the company he returned as

1988 
at stride rite chairman arnold hiatt will assume the post of 
chief executive for the time being a position he held in the past

president bush said wednesday he is close to 
deciding whether to recommend new oil and gas exploration off the 
coasts of california and florida and indicated the nations 
dependence of foreign oil will influence his decision 
members of congress who met with bush who pioneered offshore 
drilling in his days in the oil business said he did not tip his 
hand but asked many questions about the nations energy needs 
in another development the interior department told 
massachusetts members of congress it did not intend to offer leases 
on georges bank a prime fishing ground off cape cod 
in a news conference wednesday bush mentioned his previously 
stated concerns about environmental protection in the florida keys 
which he called a highly sophisticated and sensitive area 
and so ive already said that but i dont want to suggest 
that i dont feel that way about certain areas off california he 
added 
his mention of certain areas off california could mean he 
wants to block new drilling in some but not all of the two study 
areas one in northern california and one in southern california 
that along with southern florida have been under review by an 
administration task force 
the task force including cabinet members and top aides who met 
separately with bush on wednesday has presented bush with a series 
of options on how the matter might be handled administration 
officials say 
no matter what bush decides much of the waters off california 
and florida have been closed to drilling by congress until sept 30 
through a provision in an appropriations bill as they often were 
throughout the 1980s 
in the 1980s environmentalists persuaded appropriations 
subcommittees that the risks of drilling were too great the loss 
of 11 millions of gallons of crude oil from the exxon valdez in 
alaskas prince william sound in march 1989 reinforced their 
arguments according to many in congress 
but bush already had promised in the 1988 campaign to look into 
the offshore drilling issue 
massachusetts politicians had protested that drilling on georges 
bank now believed to contain gas not oil posed too much danger 
to the fish and the livelihoods of the crews who harvest them 
rep chet atkins dmass provided documents sent him by barry 
williamson director of the minerals management service in the 
interior department indicating no lease offerings there before 
1993 which would mean no drilling could take place before 1996 
the possiblity of drilling on georges bank is now very very 
remote atkins said 
democratic sen alan cranston in a twist on the coastal 
protection views held by many in the states delegation told 
reporters after meeting with bush that he would not oppose all new 
drilling in southern california which was usually omitted from 
annual congressionally mandated drilling bans in the 1980s 
i doubt there are any places in northern california where 
there should be any oil drilling but there might well be some off 
the coast of southern california to the far south and way out at 
sea it should not be close to the shore he said 
pressed on where he was talking about the senator told 
reporters he had no specific suggestions but that it should be 
at least 25 miles off shore 
republican sen pete wilson who has differed with the bush 
administration by insisting on no new drilling off california 
seemed surprised at cranstons statement 
we are facing a situation where there is relatively little 
oil where there is not enough to warrant a substantial risk 
said wilson who is a candidate for governor in the environmentally 
conscious state 
he said bush in the meeting with congress members said very 
little he listened 
he and other members said bush seemed most interested in hearing 
about how he can balance the nations energy needs against 
environmental protection and decrease dependence on foreign oil 
according to the american petroleum institute the principal 
trade group 49 percent of the nations oil came from abroad in the 
first quarter of 1990 compared with 44 percent in the same period 
of 1989

western union corp said its 
losses widened sharply in the first three quarter as the booming 
trade in facsimile transmissions cut into its profitable telex 
business 
increased debt service and costs of integrating its financial 
services business also contributed to the loss the company said 
wednesday 
the company sid it lost 181 million on revenues of 145 
million in the first three months of the year compared with a loss 
of 189000 on revenues of 158 million in the first three months 
of 1989 
after deducting for undeclared dividends on preferred shares 
the latest loss amounted to 37 cents for each share of common 
stock compared with a loss of 32 cents a share in the first 
quarter of 1989 
the company had about twice as many common shares outstanding in 
the latest period as a year earlier spokesman warren r bechtel 
said it hasnt paid a dividend since 1988 he added 
bechtel blamed the losses partly on mounting debt payments and 
the cost of integrating the national payments network into the 
western union system the interest rate on 500 million in senior 
secured notes was reset last june from 165 percent to 1925 
percent he said 
western union bought the national payments network in the summer 
of 1989 he said the system that lets utilities customers pay 
bills through outlets in local stores

in the latest body blow to california 
aerospace northrop corp said wednesday it would cut 3000 jobs or 
7 percent of its workforce by year end because of defense spending 
cuts on its b2 bomber 
the radardodging batwinged stealth bomber made up 58 percent 
of northrops 128 billion in firstquarter sales 
as world tensions ease however defense secretary dick cheney 
has proposed cutting purchases of the bomber from 132 to 75 peak 
production would fall from 36 planes a year to 12 
world events government decisions economic conditions are 
all evolving at a rapid rate at an unprecedented rate chief 
executive kent kresa said in announcing the cuts which will be met 
through layoffs and attrition 
questions are being asked about fundamental assumptions that 
have not been questioned since many of us here were children he 
said in remarks prepared for northrops annual meeting wednesday 
spokesman tony cantafio said 2700 jobs will be lost in southern 
california that follows news last week that mcdonnell douglas 
corp would cut 4000 jobs mostly in long beach and that lockheed 
corp would shut down in burbank eliminating 4500 local jobs over 
the next few years 
the layoffs could create a ripple effect through the aerospace 
industry the greatest source of manufacturing jobs in the region 
chamber of commerce economist jack kyser said 70 percent of the 
areas aerospace companies employ 50 or fewer workers kresa noted 
that northrop has 6000 subcontractors and suppliers in the region 
on our major programs today northrop as prime contractor is 
responsible for only 30 or 40 percent of the work 60 to 70 percent 
is done by our subcontractors and suppliers kresa said they 
also will be among the first to feel the effects of budget 
reductions and stretchouts 
northrops employment peaked at 48200 at the end of 1987 it 
cut 2500 employees during the past year and currently has about 
41000 workers 
kresa said northrop can eliminate its 1 billion debt by the 
mid1990s through costcutting and sale of assets the company made 
an aftertax gain of 90 million and cut its shortterm debt by 
218 million through the recent sale and partial leaseback of its 
corporate headquarters complex 
northrop officials wouldnt say what assets might be sold 
kresa also set a goal for northrop which lost 635 million 
last year or returning to the 20 percent returnonequity level it 
achieved in the mid80s 
i was impressed by his comments said lawrence harris a 
securities analyst with bateman eichler hill richards in los 
angeles the 20 percent returnonequity goal is certainly 
ambitious but its the kind of target the street would be looking 
for on a longterm basis

the federal aviation administration has ordered 
operators of hundreds of new boeing 737s to inspect the jetliners 
after a steering wheel came off in a copilots hands boeing said 
wednesday 
the faa issued a telegraphic airworthiness directive wednesday 
ordering immediate inspections of the copilot control columns on 
the 378 most recent 737s built said mark hooper a spokesman for 
boeing commercial airplane group 
the directive orders the inspections within 72 hours and affects 
737 models 300 400 and 500 built over the past two years roughly 
hooper said 
boeing told the faa monday that a steering wheel came off in a 
copilots hands during a flight hooper said the plane landed 
safely after the pilot took back control of the aircraft he said 
the spokesman refused to say what airline was involved or 
whether it was a foreign or domestic carrier 
kiro television reported that the incident occurred during a 
test flight of a 737 that had just been delivered to a west german 
airline the station did not identify the airline 
the pilot turned it over to the copilot hooper said of the 
flight the copilot obviously recognized the problem and the 
pilot regained control of the plane and took it from there 
an investigation revealed the cotter pin was missing from the 
bolt that attaches the steering wheel to the control column and 
the bolts threads were damaged hooper said boeing inspected 
several undelivered 737s on its flight line and found one other 
plane with a cotter pin missing from the copilots wheel he said 
inspectors are supposed to check that the in is in place he added 
i think we have to find out the degree to which the problem 
exists and then trace some steps back to see where the problem 
occurred or with what particular assembly he said 
the faa directive orders the aircraft operators to inspect the 
cotter pins visually which hooper said takes only a few seconds 
airlines are to make any necessary repairs and report their 
findings to the faa within 48 hours of making checks 
the 737 is the smallest and most popular jetliner made by 
boeing it is a twinengine shorttomedium range aircraft 
produced in the seattle suburb of renton the model 300 can carry 
as many as 141 passengers the 737400 can carry up to 159 
passengers and the 737500 the newest model can seat 122
