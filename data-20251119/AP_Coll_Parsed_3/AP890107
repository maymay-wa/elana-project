speaker jim wright who normally has strong 
influence over the house agenda says he will neither encourage 
nor prevent a vote on a 50 percent pay raise proposed for 
congress judges and top executive branch officials 
while wright declined to take a stand friday on the politically 
risky pay plan he said lawmakers would ban speaking fees and 
certain other outside income for themselves if the proposal were 
enacted 
the large pay raise was recommended by a presidential commission 
and endorsed thursday by president reagan who will formally send 
the proposal to congress with his budget plan on monday 
we must ensure that the door to service remains open to 
americans who must work to support their families educate their 
children and save for their retirement the president wrote 
congress in a letter explaining his position reagan also proposed 
an end to the oftencriticized outside income system for members of 
congress 
the raise will become law automatically unless each house of 
congress rejects it by feb 8 30 days after reagans budget 
submission 
i think that the speaker house speaker jim wright is 
committed to making sure there is no vote said rep tom tauke 
riowa who has proposed legislation requiring congress to vote on 
any pay raise while delaying enactment until the next congress 
wright said friday i will neither encourage nor prevent a 
vote regular procedure will be followed 
regular procedure normally means legislation would go to a 
committee be the subject of hearings and return to the house floor 
after committee approval such a process normally takes far longer 
than 30 days 
referring to outside income for lawmakers called honoraria 
wright said if the pay raise takes effect there will be a ban on 
speaking fees and certain other forms of outside incomeearning 
limitations are being drafted in bipartisan consultations 
in the senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine has 
promised a vote 
sen gordon j humphrey rnh called the pay raise 
preposterous and said he had asked senate leaders to schedule an 
early vote on a resolution of disapproval 
reagan chose not to modify the presidential commissions 
recommendation that members of congress and federal district judges 
who now make 89500 a year be paid 135000 
the speakers annual salary would go from 115000 to 175000 
and that of majority and minority leaders from 99500 to 155000 
top executivebranch officials such as cabinet members would get 
raises from their current 99500 a year to 155000 
reagans proposal would raise a presidents annual pay to about 
350000 from the current 200000 where it has stood since 1969 
however such a hike would not take effect until 1993 because of a 
constitutional prohibition on raising a presidents pay during his 
term 
presidentelect bush said friday he supported reagans decision 
but may take another look at the issue when he becomes president 
bush takes office jan 20 
asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big pay 
increase at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits 
bush said well i dont know whether we can afford anything than 
to get this deficit under control 
david keating executive vice president of the national taxpayers 
union said reagan has a personal stake in his recommendation 
because his pension would rise by 56 percent if the pay raise is 
approved the pension is tied to cabinet salaries 
the pension increase from 99500 to 155000 annually also would 
apply to former presidents ford carter and nixon 
keating said reagan and the three former presidents should refuse 
the increase 
a white house press spokesman bj cooper said the taxpayer 
union figures were accurate but had no comment on the call for 
reagan to refuse the increase 
the president was not aware of that when he approved the pay 
raise cooper said i dont know whether it would have changed 
his decision the other factors being so overwhelming

30 percent while medicare and medicaid would be restrained under a 
health and human services budget the reagan administration will 
submit to congress on monday a published report said 
the new york times in its saturday editions reported that the 
4244 billion budget for the department of health and human 
resources amounts to 228 billion more than the department got in 
1988 
more than half of the budget 260 billion would be spent on 
social security which would receive 13 billion more than is now 
spent to cover an increase in recipients and a 36 percent 
costofliving boost the times said 
the proposed expenditures are subject to revision by 
presidentelect george bush after jan 20 and by congress although 
bush has said he would not make cuts in social security which goes 
to more than 40 million americans 
for aids the reagan administration recommended spending 25 
billion including 16 billion for research education and 
prevention and 925 million for treatment and other assistance for 
aids victims 
the administration proposed 1061 billion for medicare an 
increase of 10 billion but still 35 billion less than would have 
occurred under current law it proposed 36 billion for medicaid a 
boost of nearly 2 billion but 2 billion less than under current 
law the times said 
medicare is the health insurance program for 31 million older 
americans and 3 million other disabled persons and medicaid is a 
federalstate health program for the poor

central american immigrants filed suit 
against the immigration and naturalization service on friday 
demanding that the agency once again let them travel to their us 
destinations to apply for asylum 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in brownsville seeks 
to reverse ins rules of dec 16 that made it impossible for most 
asylumseekers to leave south texas or work while waiting 30 days 
for approval or denial of their claims 
it would allow the asylum applicant to have the interview and 
the adjudication of the asylum claim heard and decided by the ins 
office nearest their intended residence in the us said robert 
rubin who heads the national immigrant and refugee rights project 
for the san francisco lawyers committee for urban affairs 
a hearing has been set for 9 am monday on their motion for a 
temporary restraining order ins officials in washington declined 
comment on the lawsuit because they had not seen it 
most central americans enter the united states illegally in the 
brownsville area of the lower rio grande valley the nearest land 
point to central america 
officials with the ins harlingen district said nine personnel 
were added friday bringing the total of harlingen asylum 
adjudicators to 16 and will speed up processing and eliminate a 
backlog 
the lawsuit accuses the ins of imposing a policy change without 
allowing public comment of denying aliens access to the asylum 
process and access to counsel and improperly restricting the right 
to work 
it cites the case of a 69yearold nicaraguan woman who said she 
slept outside the ins office in harlingen for three nights to keep 
her place in line then was told she needed a fingerprint card she 
said she then walked four miles to the harlingen police department 
to obtain the prints then returned to the ins office where she 
again slept outside to keep her place 
before dec 16 asylumseekers in harlingen were allowed to 
travel to their us destinations to apply for asylum often miami 
or los angeles 
ins officials said they adopted the new procedure in harlingen to 
reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curb abuses of the 
system that delayed processing for legitimate asylum cases 
they also said the new procedure apparently has begun to deter 
frivolous claims with the more than 2000 claims a week in early 
december reduced to about 1000 a week since dec 16 
those who previously would have traveled out of the area are 
staying in places such as the condemned amber motel in brownsville 
on the border 25 miles south of harlingen and a squalid makeshift 
campsite where several hundred people have carved out spaces in the 
brush

the citys transit and sewage authority is giving 
up 480000 of granite it bought for a downtown bus tunnel because 
the stone came from south africa the agency announced 
it would violate the spirit of our policy and would be an 
affront to the community to use the granite executive alan gibbs 
told the metro council thursday 
the granite enough to cover 24000 square feet is sitting in 
supply yards in italy where it was cut 
were going to have to eat the cost said david kalberer 
superintendent of the 430 million tunnel project metro hopes to 
sell the granite for scrap to recoup some of the cost he added 
seattle mayor charles royer agreed with the decision 
this could be a serious affront and embarrassment for lots of 
people he said 
the metro council banned the purchase of south african goods 
because of that countrys policy of racial segregation or 
apartheid after a county councilman and city councilman protested 
the use of south african steel in tunnel work in 1987

the first man since the vietnam war to get 
through eight years of draft eligibility without being called to 
arms said something was missing from his 26th birthday celebration 
im proud within myself about it i wish i had an award or 
something though that would have been nice maybe a plaque to hang 
on the wall said joseph frank 
frank the first 18yearold to sign up and be processed by the 
selective service system after draft registration was revived in 
1981 turned 26 on friday that made him too old to be called up 
even if congress and the president reactivate the draft according 
to selective service officials in washington 
i didnt have to go active and im glad about that frank 
said but if it was gods will i would have gone its a blessing 
to be a soldier for this country 
frank said he had no idea he was the first man in the country to 
register when he did so he said he just followed the law and signed 
up 
i wasnt worried about being drafted when i was 18 i dont 
think i even thought about it but if it had happened it would have 
just happened when i turned 21 i got more worried about it frank 
said 
the draft was stopped in 1973 after the end of the vietnam war 
but registration was revived on jan 5 1981 federal law requires 
every man to register with selective service within 30 days of his 
18th birthday

the federal government is recommending that 
airlines replace tens of thousands of rivets on more than 600 older 
boeing 727 passenger jets 
in a proposed directive issued friday the federal aviation 
administration also urged the carriers to adopt special inspection 
procedures until the rivet work is done 
the repairs are not expected to disrupt air service because most 
of the work will be done on a timetable that could stretch over as 
long as four years faa officials said 
the proposed directive is the result of increasing concern about 
cracking on older commercial jetliners it is similar to an order 
issued last october for older boeing 737s 
a final order will not be issued until after a brief period to 
allow public and industry comment 
the faa estimated the repairs and extra inspections of 623 older 
boeing 727s will cost the airlines 357 million 
in a separate action friday the faa broadened a previous 
directive for special inspections of older mcdonnell douglas dc9s 
to include any aircraft with at least 45000 landings 
last november the agency told airlines to conduct repetitive 
inspections using the electronic eddy current method of all 
dc9s that have had more than 55000 landings because of concern 
about possible cracks in the fuselage skin 
but the agency said since then it has discovered cracks on more 
than 20 aircraft that had between 45000 and 52000 landings 
prompting the special precautions for the additional aircraft 
the agency said 476 dc9s belonging to us air carriers would be 
affected by the new directive 
under the order airlines must conduct repetitive eddy current 
inspections of the fuselage skin as well as an area just over the 
wings on the dc9s the inspections must be conducted at least every 
5800 landings 
the proposed directive on the boeing 727s requires that airlines 
over the next four years replace from 3300 to 4150 rivets on each 
plane depending on the model of 727 involved it said the 
countersunk rivets now on the planes is believed to cause 
cracking under some circumstances while the substitute 
buttonhead is less likely to do so 
the faa said cracks on both the 727 and 737 aircraft have been 
traced to a cold bonding process that was used in the earlier 
models of the plane to bind sheets of fuselage skin together that 
method was discontinued in later models 
the agency said it plans to order eddy current testing and 
increased visual testing of the boeing 727 on a regular basis until 
the rivets can be changed 
last october the faa ordered thousands of rivets replaced on 
older boeing 737s to help guard against cracking 
there have been a number of incidents during the past year in 
which large cracks developed on older aircraft

inmates at the youthful correctional 
offender institution rioted for about two hours friday but 
corrections officers and police tactical units stayed on overnight 
authorities said 
three inmates and one corrections officer were injured in the 
uprising and there was minimal damage to the lockup said kathy 
drake a spokeswoman for the department of corrections in atlanta 
ms drake said she did not know what set off the disturbance or 
how many inmates were involved despite the name of the facility 
the average age of the 970 inmates at the prison is 24 according to 
ms drake 
ms drake said the injured officer who was not identified broke 
his hand apparently by slipping and falling the injury she said 
was not in contact with an inmate she did not have details of 
the inmates injuries 
five tactical units of 18 officers each were called in to help 
stop the uprising which began about 445 pm apparently in 
sympathy with a disturbance at a nearby state prison earlier this 
week 
the riot which broke out around 445 pm with inmates damaging 
and breaking property ms drake said 
the crowd control officers used tear gas to halt the uprising in 
the kemper building one of three units comprising the lockup ms 
drake said 
when they did use tear gas they immediately began to quiet 
down it then spilled over into the holly building a second 
unit she said 
tear gas was not used in the second unit because the situation 
there was not as severe ms drake said there was no damage done 
it was mostly a lot of yelling a lot of cussing she said 
because the tear gas spread beyond the kemper building about 100 
inmates could not be returned immediately to their cells and were 
held in a yard until the gas clears ms drake said 
two tactical units from milledgeville in central georgia about 
25 miles east of macon and one from reidsville remained on the 
scene ms drake said adding that the department of corrections 
would begin an internal investigation into the disturbance 
if the inmates who were responsible are identified they would be 
segregated from the rest of the prison population and would face 
administrative charges she said 
fridays uprising marked the second disturbance at a georgia 
prison this week on tuesday inmates rioted at rivers correctional 
institution in milledgeville an incident officials called the most 
serious in the state in 10 years 
more than 900 inmates participated in the earlier incident with 
three officers and three inmates injured and 300000 in damage

leading senators are demanding attorney general 
dick thornburgh explain why the reagan administration refused to 
release classified information deemed important to the irancontra 
case against oliver l north 
the reagan administrations position on the secrecy question 
contributed to a move by independent counsel lawrence walsh earlier 
this week to have two key charges against north dropped 
thornburgh on friday strongly defended the administrations 
refusal to allow the release of more classified material in the 
north case saying that dropping the conspiracy and theft counts is 
hardly going to provide a precedent in every case 
the attorney general said the question is whether it is more 
important to go ahead with a particular criminal prosecution as 
opposed to what harm might come to the countrys longterm 
interests by exposing sensitive information 
an interagency intelligence group in the administration refused 
to permit the release of additional classified material which us 
district judge gerhard a gesell said must be disclosed in order for 
north to get a fair trial 
walsh then decided to abandon the charges that the former white 
house aide illegally diverted more than 14 million in usiran 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels three others are also 
charged with the same counts but their trials have been severed 
north still faces 12 other charges his trial is scheduled to 
begin jan 31 
the classified information procedures act requires a full 
explanation to the congressional committees as to why 
conspiracy and theft charges against north could not be tried 
without disclosing classified information said the chairmen of 
the senate judiciary and intelligence committees 
in a letter to the attorney general the senators asked 
thornburgh to include the explanation in his next semiannual report 
on the operation of the law which was passed by congress to prevent 
defendants from using graymail to scuttle their prosecution 
the letter came from sens david boren dokla and william 
cohen rmaine respectively chairman and vicechairman of the 
intelligence panel and sen joseph biden ddel who chairs the 
judiciary committee 
gesell on monday is expected to grant walshs motion to drop the 
two counts against north 
the classified information procedures act requires the attorney 
general to report to the congressional intelligence and judiciary 
committees any time criminal charges are dismissed on grounds that 
continued prosecution in open court would jeopardize national 
security 
the lawmakers acknowledged that walsh not the justice 
department had decided to seek dismissal of the two central charges 
but they said the cipa reporting provision was enacted to 
provide an opportunity for congress to review as appropriate 
circumstances of this sort 
such reviews are needed to ensure that decisions not to 
prosecute alleged criminal conduct were in fact prompted by 
legitimate national security concerns

amtrak and a control tower operator who tested 
positive for drugs share the blame for a bostonbound train 
derailment that injured 25 people says the national transportation 
safety board 
the operator thomas connor fled the control tower after the 
january 1988 accident in chester pa and later tested positive for 
marijuana and small traces of cocaine and methamphetamine 
the ntsb said in a report friday that connor who resigned after 
the accident let the night owl train travel on a section of 
track undergoing maintenance the train struck a work vehicle 
the ntsb said connors failure to hit the proper switch so the 
train could cross to the right track was the result of of 
impairment by drugs or distraction or both 
the agency said amtrak shared responsibility with connor for the 
accident it said the passenger line should develop a procedure to 
prevent locomotives or trains from entering outofservice track 
sections unless permission has been received from the person in 
charge of the outofservice track 
amtrak also failed to adequately monitor the activities and job 
performance of the tower operator the agency said

leave available to french women before their due date said 
researcher emile papiernik 
for example a woman whose job involved a lot of standing might 
begin the leave 10 weeks before the due date said papiernik 
chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the 
university of paris south 
the program also included teaching women to avoid physically 
taxing situations at home like moving a household and to follow 
such steps as sitting rather than standing when washing clothes 
papiernik said friday in an interview 
it also stressed close relationships with caregivers he said 
the overall goal was to reduce physical exertion that triggers the 
uterus to contract during pregnancy 
a study of more than 16000 deliveries at the hospital found that 
while premature deliveries stood at 54 percent of live births for 
197174 they decreased to 36 percent for 197982 
the study could not demonstrate statistically that work leaves 
themselves made a difference but they probably helped papiernik 
wrote in a book about the research 
but an american expert said the french approach would incur 
inappropriate and unnecessary costs in the united states because 
most participants would have had fullterm pregnancies anyway 
most women at risk for premature births carry their fetuses to 
term and physicians cannot predict with great accuracy who will 
deliver prematurely said paul macdonald of the university of texas 
southwestern medical center in dallas 
macdonald also said many women may not want to pass up economic 
and psychological benefits of working 
he and papiernik spoke at a seminar sponsored by the march of 
dimes birth defects foundation 
some 350000 american babies every year are born more than three 
weeks before the end of the normal 40week term the foundation 
says they account for 70 percent of infant deaths and are at risk 
for such problems as cerebral palsy seizure disorders mental 
retardation and impairments of vision and hearing

said in a statement released by the white house shortly after the 
annoucement of the emperors death friday 
reagan said the emperors 62year reign spanned one of the most 
tumultuous and yet at the same time constructive eras in the 
history of mankind an age of unprecedented economic collapse a 
most vicious war astonishing scientific acheivement and dramatic 
political and social changes throughout the world 
it was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation his majesty 
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two 
peoples to an end and leading the japanese people through a period 
of reconstruction and reconciliation that has resulted in both the 
prosperity the japanese know today and in the close relations our

tokyo ap emperor hirohito will be remembered for one 
overwhelming decision during his 62year reign japan must bow to 
defeat for the first time in its history and end the pacific 
conflict in world war ii 
shortly after that decision and for most of his reign hirohito 
became a figurehead isolated from his subjects by tradition and 
steeped in his great love the study of marine biology he was the 
last survivor among the national leaders of the world war ii era 
but in his first 20 years the son of heaven was worshiped as 
a divinity descended from the sun goddess amaterasu 
the solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so 
intrigued hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who 
became the 124th occupant of the chrysanthemum throne at the age of 
25 on christmas day 1926 designating his reign showa 
enlightened peace 
the emperor was generally portrayed as having played no 
significant role in planning or carrying out japans military 
adventures in the 1930s and 1940s but it was his first effective 
decision as emperor and his most courageous that ended the pacific 
conflict 
on aug 10 1945 four days after historys first atomic bomb 
devastated hiroshima and one day after a us bomber dropped the 
second atomic bomb on nagasaki the generals and admirals of 
imperial japans wartime government argued for hours in the 
sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the tokyo palace 
should japan agree to the allies surrender demand or fight on 
until annihilation 
speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and 
obviously nervous monotone hirohito the spiritual and titular 
leader offered his opinion for the first time he spoke of his 
sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war and of 
families who lost everything in air raids 
i cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer he 
said ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to 
relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is 
burdened 
then evoking a memory of his grandfather the emperor meiji 
whose reign 18671912 saw the end of 250 years of feudal japanese 
isolation from the outside world hirohito told the officers 
the time has come when we must bear the unbearable 
in the days that followed hirohito continued his break with 
tradition in a national radio broadcast aug 15 the first time 
ordinary japanese ever actually heard his voice he personally 
announced the decision to surrender 
he told the ravaged nation that the war situation has developed 
not necessarily to our advantage 
three weeks later hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat striped 
trousers and a top hat to meet the allied commander gen douglas a 
macarthur at the us embassy in tokyo it was the first time 
hirohito had ever gone to see anyone and the first of several calls 
on the general who had led the pacific war against japan and became 
its postwar governor 
on new years day 1946 at macarthurs insistence the emperor 
publicly renounced his divinity it was a choice that enabled 
hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured 
that he would not face charges as a war criminal as some abroad had 
demanded 
it also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this 
gentle shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a 
living god 
the emperors status in the eyes of many japanese changed to that 
of a kind uncle 
he became a widely respected authority on marine biology he 
possessed rare collections of marine life discovered several 
species himself and wrote or coauthored at least 12 books on 
hydrozoa or sea animals his specialty 
in recent years his life had become the subject of a popular 
comic book series 
still hirohito and the imperial system remained important to 
japan 
a nationwide survey by the daily newspaper mainichi shimbun in 
march 1987 indicated more than 80 percent of 2184 people polled 
supported the imperial system while only 11 percent said it should 
be abolished five percent said the emperor should have more power 
from 1946 to 1954 hirohito toured japan to encourage the people 
to rebuild 
the imperial household agency which ran his affairs said 
hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling 
times of his life in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery 
from a war that cost 31 million japanese lives 
despite the humanization of the imperial family hirohito 
remained under strict control of the imperial household agency 
protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited 
from speaking on any controversial subject 
hirohito was born on april 29 1901 in accordance with ageold 
imperial custom he was taken from his parents as an infant to be 
reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one 
role that of emperor 
his education came as japan surged into the modern world the 
feudal samurai ethic was still strong when his grandfather died 
gen maresuke nogi the mentor for the 11yearold prince calmly 
committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor his master to the 
grave 
hirohito studied government and law with private tutors when he 
was 20 his father emperor taisho sent him abroad the first time 
any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside 
japan 
hirohito visited england scotland france belgium the 
netherlands and italy receiving various decorations he was also 
received by pope benedict xv 
the young man handled money for the first time paying his own 
fare on the paris subway he developed a passion for bacon and eggs 
and it became a lifelong breakfast habit a palace chamberlain said 
in a 1980 interview that hirohito shunned japanese food unless it 
is forced on him by an unwitting host 
hirohito also acquired a preference for western clothes he was 
never seen in public wearing traditional japanese garb and a palace 
official confided that the emperor of japan did not even own a 
kimono 
hirohito became prince regent on nov 25 1921 after his father 
became a mental and physical invalid became emperor five years 
later and was formally enthroned in 1928

sen dennis deconcini dariz has postponed a 
trip to the middle east after approval was withdrawn for his chief 
political fundraiser to accompany him as a temporary staffer on the 
senate payroll a spokesman said 
the washington post reported in todays editions that sen robert 
c byrd dwva the new appropriations committee chairman 
withdrew approval for earl katz to make the trip after receiving an 
inquiry about the arrangement 
deconcini had been scheduled to leave today for a 12day trip to 
nine mideast countries spokesman robert w maynes said katz had 
arranged the trip and it now would be postponed 
katz a retired phoenixarea real estate investor who has been 
deconcinis chief fundraiser and middle east adviser for years was 
being placed on the senate payroll for 21 days so he could arrange 
and go on the trip maynes said 
katz planned to repay his 115 salary to the government and pay 
as much of his expenses as he could the spokesman said 
the post reported that a spokeswoman for byrd said that committee 
tradition did not permit members of a senators personal staff to 
make trips on committee business without approval from the majority 
leader 
katz was placed on the payroll temporarily so he could travel on 
military aircraft and get an official passport and visas maynes 
said 
im not exactly sure why sen byrd as the majority leader 
approved it in december and then as chairman of the appropriations 
committee unapproved it today maynes said 
deconcini had planned during his trip to discuss his opposition 
to arms sales to the arab countries the state department hoped 
officials in those countries might persuade the senator to be less

although those trips did not involve military transportation

in the 44 years since he survived a 
massacre of americans at a japanese prisoner of war camp in world 
war ii glenn mcdole had often wondered what happened to his 
filipino rescuers 
a balky telephone answering machine almost cost him a chance to 
find out but thanks to the persistence of a wisconsin nurse named 
mary anne ancheta mcdole finally has been able to track down the 
guerrilla band that saved him 
fortyfour years ago mrs ancheta was mary anne major a 
7yearold whose father ran a guerrilla camp in the philippines 
mcdole was a young marine who was brought into the camp with malaria 
he was shaking like a leaf he had the chills she said 
friday i remember him although i didnt remember his name 
last month she noticed an article about a reunion of american 
prisoners of war in the philippines saw mcdoles name and called 
his home on new years eve but the tape on his answering machine 
ran out and he didnt get her last name or phone number 
publicity about his request to have mary anne call again 
resulted in a story in a green bay newspaper wednesday mrs ancheta 
saw it and called mcdole on thursday 
i saw it at 11 at night and it was too late to call i couldnt 
sleep and i called the next morning she said i felt like i 
have known him all that while its overwhelming im so glad to 
know hes alive and well after all that ordeal 
for mcdole the conversation recalled december 1944 when he and 
about 150 other americans were held by the japanese in palawan 
prison 
he had been there 33 months when american forces staged an 
invasion nearby 
they made a feint to come toward us but turned away mcdole 
recalled thats when the japanese decided to annihilate the group 
of prisoners they had us down in trenches and they threw in 
gasoline and torches the ones who climbed over the edge were 
machine gunned 
mcdoles trench was the one nearest to a 60foot cliff 
overlooking a bay 
we had started digging through anyway and we knocked the side 
of ours out and went over the cliff i think 20 25 of us made it to 
the beach but some of them panicked and they were gunned down 
i got pinned down and hid under a pile of garbage i stayed 
there all night and part of the next day i thought i was the only 
man of the 150 to be alive you do a lot of praying and crying and 
i knew that if i didnt make it nobody would know what happened 
they the japanese would probably blame it on our own planes 
of the 150 prisoners 11 escaped and six were brought to the 
guerrilla camp run by maziro major now 88 and retired in manila 
after a career in the army 
it turns out he was educated in kansas which is where he met 
his wife mcdole said they were wonderful to us they saved our 
lives 
the rebels protected and healed the americans for a month when 
they were picked up by a navy sea plane the two groups never made 
contact again 
mary anne eventually became a nurse in the office of her husband 
dr valentino ancheta in algoma wis while mcdole 67 is now 
chief of the patrol division of the polk county sheriffs office 
mcdole said he too was overwhelmed by the call its brought 
back some of the concerns of what happened to the family ive 
thought about them all a lot then all of a sudden boom you get a 
call and i find out the captain is still alive and this is his 
daughter im going to get a letter off to the captain today i feel 
real good 
all these years i had been hoping to meet one of those men 
she said she and mcdole said they both hope to attend a reunion 
next december

throughout his lifetime emperor hirohito reigned 
behind the wide moats and imposing stone walls of the vast imperial 
palace grounds in central tokyo during his 62year reign only once 
did an exclusive interview with him appear in print 
the imperial household agency zealously protects the imperial 
family from intrusions but granted the unique interview to a 
persistent american journalist shortly before hirohitos 1975 visit 
to the united states 
bernard krisher tokyo bureau chief for newsweek magazine from 
1968 to 1980 kept his campaign secret from competitors 
ever since i came here i waited for an occasion to persuade the 
imperial household agency to grant me an interview krisher now 
chief editor of focus a japaneselanguage magazine told the 
associated press 
for six months after the announcement of hirohitos trip krisher 
spent about half his time meeting with lower and middlelevel 
officials i knew they couldnt help me but i asked them not to 
oppose or discuss my campaign krisher said 
finally persuaded that an interview before the emperors us 
visit would be worthwhile imperial household agency officials 
relented krisher was permitted to meet the monarch at the imperial 
palace for 32 minutes although he was asked to submit questions in 
advance krisher was allowed to ask other questions 
the emperor described his overseas tours to europe in 1921 and 
with empress nagako again in 1971 as the happiest times of his 
life my happest expectation is looking forward to our trip to the 
united states hirohito told krisher 
as to my view of americans they seem to have very clearcut 
views they are always straightforward pragmatic and realistic i 
believe they are a people who are very easy to be friends with 
the emperor said 
during his twoweek visit with the empress hirohito met 
government officials and farmers and dined with hollywood stars he 
had said the visit was the fulfillment of a 50yearold dream 
although hirohito admitted to a desire deep in my heart to 
become a common man and to be closer to his people he also 
expressed his belief that most japanese still have a respect for 
the imperial family 
the imperial tradition has survived for centuries in japan he 
said because throughout history the imperial family has always 
given first thought to the welfare of the people 
the next emperor hirohitos son crown prince akihito may have 
his own ideas but it has always been the tradition of the imperial 
family to act for the benefit of the people so i am also looking 
forward to such an attitude on his part as well he said 
the emperor hesitated to name influential people in his life but 
did speak of his grandfather the emperor meiji during the meiji era 
1868 to 1912 hirohitos grandfather played an important role in 
introducing public education and in modernizing his mostly 
agricultural nation 
i always have kept his deeds in my mind hirohito said 
the emperor said the saddest time of his life was during world 
war ii unable to watch his people suffer further after the atomic 
bomb attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki hirohito accepted allied 
surrender terms in august 1945 urging his nation to bear the 
unbearable 
at the time of the termination of the war i made the decision 
on my own that is because the prime minister failed to obtain 
agreement in the cabinet and asked my opinion so i stated my 
opinion and then made the decision according to my opinion 
hirohito told krisher 
the emperor has never made a direct public admission that he 
opposed the war maintaining that the constitution would not permit 
him to do so 
now at the time of the outbreak of the war and also before the 
war when the cabinet made decisions i could not override their 
decisions he said 
krishers interview went to press soon after he met hirohito 
about a week later the emperor met with a small group of foreign 
reporters who had been outraged when the exclusive newsweek article 
appeared nothing could top that interview krisher said

once a familiar figure who often accompanied emperor 
hirohito in his travels empress nagako in recent years has been 
confined to a wheelchair and seldom makes public appearances 
the 85yearold empress married hirohito who died saturday 
nearly 65 years ago and would have celebrated her anniversary later 
this month 
born march 6 1903 nagako was the daughter of imperial prince 
kuniyoshi kuni she was brought up in tokyo attending the elite 
peers school for girls 
she later received instruction from two american quakers 
elizabeth vining and esther rhoads who were credited with inspiring 
many of the democratic changes which permeated the private life of 
the imperial family mrs vining also tutored crown prince akihito 
to his fluent english 
at age 15 princess nagako was one of several prospective brides 
selected for hirohito then crown prince 
he chose her over the objections of some powerful court 
officials including the fujiwara family that traditionally supplied 
imperial brides they tried to stop the engagement by producing 
medical records of color blindness in her mothers family but 
doctors disputed the claims and hirohito made it clear he already 
had decided 
once betrothed the couple met only nine times during their 
sixyear engagement the wedding set for 1923 was postponed after 
the great kanto earthquake in september left much of the capital 
burned and in ruins they were wed in an elaborate ceremony on jan 
26 1924 
on christmas day in 1926 nagako became empress of japan when 
hirohito succeeded to the legendary chryanthemum throne on the death 
of his father the taisho emperor 
married longer than any imperial couple in japans history she 
called him okami or honorable master and he affectionately 
referred to her as nagamiya naga from her name and miya 
meaning princess 
she gave birth to seven children the first four were all girls 
and court officials urged hirohito to take a concubine to ensure 
there would be a male heir to the throne 
but the emperor refused and the next child was a boy crown 
prince akihito who was born on dec 23 1933 prince hitachi was 
born in 1935 and a fifth daughter in 1939 
two of their children died a daughter during infancy and the 
eldest child the former princess teru at age 35 in 1961 
the empress enjoys writing 31syllable poems called waka and 
plays the piano violin and koto a 13stringed japanese instrument 
she studied painting under two of japans most respected artists 
signing her work toen or peach garden collections of her works 
have been published in two volumes and an exhibition of her 
drawings was held when she and hirohito traveled to washington in 
1975 
according to custom she spent most of her time with her husband 
and family at the moated imperial palace in central tokyo or their 
mountain and seaside villas 
she kept busy with various indoor duties including newspaper 
clipping for the emperor and keeping track of greetings to foreign 
dignitaries imperial household officials say 
confined by a back ailment and hip problems to a wheelchair the 
empress in recent years has rarely appeared in public but her 
smile graceful wave and devotion to her husband have made her a 
familiar grandmotherly figure to the japanese

multiple abdominal organ transplants are still 
in the early stages of development where failure is common but hope 
remains high despite the death of another toddler following the 
risky surgery experts say 
were in areas that are essentially unchartered said dr 
marc rowe chief of pediatric surgery at childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh what were doing is making tentative steps and then 
very carefully analyzing where weve been and what weve learned 
before we make any decision about the next one when well do one or 
whether well do one 
the fifth of six children in the country to undergo a multiple 
abdominal organ transplant died friday threeyearold rolandrea 
dodge of fruitland nm survived six weeks with a transplanted 
liver pancreas stomach small intestine and portion of a large 
intestine and was awaiting another set of organs 
four other recipients died shortly after the transplants and the 
sole survivor calvin oliveira 14 months of deerfield beach fla 
was doing well friday despite a seizure earlier in the week and a 
bout of pneumonia said dr tony dalessandro a transplant fellow 
at the university of wisconsin 
the boy received a small intestine and liver dec 31 at the 
university of wisconsin hospital and clinics in madison 
every organ thats been transplanted has had its early 
problems dalessandro said there are hurdles that you have to 
go over and along the way you have to learn from everything thats 
been done in order for things to progress 
the death of five patients is very disappointing said dr 
james w williams director of transplantation at 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in chicago 
but this is what happened in the early days of liver 
transplantation he said 
rolandrea better known as rolly was with her parents brandon 
and cyndi dodge when she died in the hospitals intensive care unit 
the childs chances of withstanding another fiveorgan 
transplant providing a suitable donor could have been found began 
to dwindle friday as her condition swiftly deteriorated her name 
was placed back on the transplant waiting list wednesday four days 
after tests showed her small intestine was being rejected by her 
bodys natural immune system 
doctors do not know whether any of the other four organs 
transplanted nov 29 were rejected or to what degree rowe said 
the child was born with a disorder that prevented her intestines 
from absorbing food and liquids 
the nations first multiple abdominal organ transplant was 
performed in 1983 by dr thomas e starzl of the university of 
pittsburgh who pioneered liver transplants that first patient a 
6yearold girl lived only a few hours 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota questioned the ethics of the operation 
even if it worked well and people were living with a good 
quality of life im still not sure there are enough potential 
donors caplan said its very rare to have someone with five 
good organs 
im also not sure society is going to view giving them all to a 
single person is the best thing to do i dont he said i think 
if you can spread the organs to more people that is what should be 
done the ethical principle should be to save the most lives 
intestines are especially difficult to transplant because of the 
extremely technical nature of the surgery the lack of biological 
markers indicating organ rejection and the bowels ability unique 
among organs to counterattack the patients immune system 
dalessandro said 
the longest survivor of a multiple organ abdominal transplant 
tabatha foster 3 of madisonville ky died last may six months 
after receiving five organs at childrens hospital 
unfortunately many many children are in desperate need of 
having this sort of operation rowe said we cant possibly 
think about the success and failure what were thinking about is 
trying to have a child who has a fatal disease and trying to 
have them live and have a good life

akihito who becomes japans first emperor to ascend 
the chrysanthemum throne as a human and not a living god has 
quietly transformed the cloistered monarchy into a popular symbol of 
the people 
the grayhaired akihito has waited 55 years to take up the 
imperial mantle a gracious selfeffacing man schooled among 
commoners he has spent those years maturing with his country 
as hirohito lay dying the prince assumed the full roster of the 
emperors official duties on sept 22 
the princes daily shuttles from his residence near the forested 
imperial compound to hirohitos deathbed drew swarms of 
photographers whether in predawn darkness or afternoon drizzle 
akihitos face showed the same stoic deference to the ailing 
monarch and court physicians listening outside the imperial chamber 
reported quiet conversations between father and son 
akihito took on the imperial duties once before as hirohito 
recuperated from intestinal bypass surgery in september 1987 he 
retained a few responsibilities but returned most after the 
emperors recovery those duties include affixing the imperial seal 
to government laws and appointments opening sessions of parliament 
and receiving foreign ambassadors 
to these the prince has added frequent visits to factory 
openings festivals and various observances across japan and with 
numerous trips abroad as his fathers proxy he has almost 
singlehandedly brought japans monarchy into the global age and the 
eye of a curious public 
i want to be a man with a strong moral backbone with keen 
reliable insight and knowledge he once reportedly told a friend 
i want to shake up the imperial protocol system 
akihito set his most spectacular imperial precedent with his 
marriage in 1959 to a commoner michiko shoda was the beautiful 
cultured daughter of a wealthy miller and the young prince courted 
her by phone in a widely reported romance that was conservative but 
refreshingly typical 
the match shocked the imperial retinue and thrilled the public 
hirohito gave his consent and the couple married after a cavalcade 
that drew 500000 gawking subjects onto the streets of tokyo 
akihito and his princess produced three children prince hiro 
who at 28 is next in the imperial succession prince aya 22 and 
19yearold princess nori they broke another imperial tradition 
with their decision to raise the children by themselves 
born dec 23 1933 as a militaristic japan geared for growing 
confrontation in asia and the pacific akihito was shuttled among 
the imperial familys countryside villas when american planes began 
firebombing tokyo in the closing months of the war he was still 
short of his 12th birthday when his fathers armies were crushed and 
the nation suffered the ultimate defeat in 1945 
at the urging of us occupation officials hirohito also 
surrendered the divinity that had been the birthright of every 
japanese monarch and agreed to a new constitutional role as the 
symbol of the state and of the unity of the people deriving his 
position from the will of the people 
akihito took his role seriously the imperial family should 
always be passive he has said the most important thing is the 
will of the people 
having inherited a centuriesold legacy of passive monarchs his 
job may have been made easier the prince who was invested as heir 
to the throne in an unprecedented public ceremony in 1952 soon set

california smokers and smokeshop owners are 
fuming over a weekold tobacco tax increase that boosts the cost of 
a pack of cigarettes from a vending machine to 2 or more 
the tax approved by voters in november and effective jan 1 
jumped from a dime to 35 cents on a pack of cigarettes and raised 
the price of cigars chewing tobacco snuff and pipe tobacco by 42 
percent 
theyre leaving here screaming said mike mustafa a clerk at 
mikes grocery in san francisco theyre saying no way they 
storm out the door they think its only me raising the price i 
tell them you voted for it 
the hike makes californias tobacco tax one of the nations 
highest minnesotas tax of 38 cents a pack on cigarettes is tops 
by contrast north carolina where tobacco is the leading cash crop 
charges a mere 2 cents a pack 
the tax increase coincided with price increases from many 
wholesalers and a new federal tax of 45 cents a pound on tobacco 
some manufacturers are charging 75 cents a pound more for pipe 
tobacco and 5 to 15 cents more for each cigar 
a pack of regular domestic cigarettes that sold for about 150 
two weeks ago is now selling for 175 over some counters 2 to 
225 in vending machines and 3 at candlestick park concession 
stands 
at one smoke shop the price of a 14ounce package of pipe 
tobacco jumped from 1056 to 1816 
the tax is expected to generate 650 million in revenue to be 
spent for health care for the indigent research on smokingcaused 
diseases smoking prevention education and fire prevention it was 
approved by a 58 percent to 42 percent margin 
american tobacco institute spokesman walker merryman in 
washington dc said no one really knows how many people may cut 
back on smoking or quit but the longterm economic impact on the 
industry undoubtedly will be negative 
i think its a brutal tax you dont see this sort of tax on 
alcohol said judy adami whose family has run the smoke shop at 
bank of america headquarters in san francisco for 18 years 
cigarette sales are down adami said but faring even worse are 
highquality cigars cigars that sold for about 63 a box a year ago 
are about 100 now 
she blamed the declining sales on the tax increase new years 
resolutions by many smokers to quit and endoftheyear stockpiling 
adami said many customers are stoic the answer i get is this 
will separate the men from the boys 
it was amazing how many cigarettes we were selling during the 
last week of the year said joe singleton owner of ramona village 
market and liquor in chino south of los angeles the 
manufacturers couponed their products with everybody stockpiling i 
think they did pretty good at getting rid of their old inventory 
at a tobacco shop in el cerrito about 15 miles east of san 
francisco an owner who asked not to be identified said he sold only 
two packs of cigarettes between new years day and late thursday 
this is a state tax that is killing me and killing me he 
said adding that he may shut down unless business improves he 
contended that election advertising for the proposition stressed 
taxes on cigarettes alone 
bob wharton a smokewatchers international director and longtime 
leader of stopsmoking clinics doubted that higher prices affect 
the habits of hardcore smokers 
the biggest thing that motivates people to stop smoking is peer 
pressure more than all the health scares surgeon generals 
warnings or price he said 
at the tinder box tobacco shop in glendale near los angeles a 
woman who asked not to be named said my mother told me if it was 
2 a cigarette shed still smoke 
researchers at the national centers for disease control in 
atlanta issued a report thursday saying that smoking is more of a 
mark of the poor and less educated and has declined across all 
educational groups 
the researchers also said fewer than 10 percent of college 
graduates will smoke in the year 2000 but at least 30 percent of 
those with no more than a high school education will 
more than 50 million americans smoke smokingrelated deaths 
claim 390000 lives in the united states annually according to

national security adviser donald p gregg as ambassador to south 
korea he also named lawrence s eagleburger a protege and 
associate of henry kissinger as his choice for deputy secretary of 
state 
the gregg nomination could spark controversy because of the

indication of when he will name an energy secretary and appoint a 
drugczar

federal officials bush said he may revisit the pay question when he 
is president 
i dont know whether we can afford anything other than to get 
this deficit under control he said adding that when the buck 
is stopping on my desk i may have something else to say about it 
eagleburger was a career foreign service officer who rose to the

consulting business he is currently president of kissinger 
associates inc

catto a former white house protocol chief as ambassador to 
britain and vernon a walters the outgoing united nations 
ambassador as ambassador to west germany 
bush in a brief exchange with reporters said irancontra 
prosecutor lawrence walsh did the right thing in moving to drop 
two key charges against oliver north because of national security 
concerns 
i think he properly found that there are legitimate national 
security interests that need to be protected said the vice 
president 
bush will not make a formal state of the union address until next 
year but aides say they expect the new president to address 
congress a few weeks after the jan 20 inauguration

session of the congress

fiscal 1990 on monday administration officials say it will hold the 
deficit to 92 billion 
i wont have time to submit a budget this thick said bush 
holding his hands a foot apart but i will have time to analyze 
the presidents proposals a budget incidentally that will go up 
there without raising taxes and say heres what ill add here 
and take off a little there something of that nature 
the 1990 budget year begins oct 1 of this calendar year 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan will propose 
eliminating 80 programs many of them survivors of past reagan hit 
lists 
i hasten to emphasize that this is a reagan administration 
budget and not a bush administration budget said fitzwater who 
will also be bushs spokesman bush will make some alterations and 
change some priorities fitzwater said but this is not a 
goodcop badcop exercise 
fridays bush appointments include five top positions at the 
state department under bushs secretary of statedesignate james a

in a modest tent surrounded by crumbling 
palaces where ethiopian emperors reigned for 250 years a united 
nations official appealed for funds to rebuild the grandeur of this 
marxist states feudal past 
these sites are part of our universal cultural heritage 
unesco chief federico mayor told western ambassadors international 
donors and representatives of other un agencies thursday the 
history of this region is as imposing as the historical remains are 
impressive 
the directorgeneral of the united nations educational 
scientific and cultural organization arrived in ethiopias capital 
wednesday to dramatize the need for 145 million for ethiopias 
10year program to restore palaces monasteries castles and other 
monuments that unesco has declared heritages of mankind 
mayor immediately flew to gondar 285 miles northwest of addis 
ababa a city graced by palaces and castles built by emperors who 
ruled between 1632 and 1868 
palaces such as gondars ras beit are in need of restoration 
because they have been used continuously for two or more centuries 
ras beit is an 18th century edifice used as offices of president 
mengistu haile mariams government 
some monuments were nearly destroyed in warfare between different 
dynasties and in resistance to foreign invasions others fell into 
disrepair because of neglect 
in need of repair are the 11 fantastical churches hewn from rock 
in northern lalibella town monasteries around lake tana the source 
of the blue nile and the granitecarved obelisks of axum which once 
rose 13 storys high 
axums tallest obelisk an intricately carved stone column that 
once stretched up 100 feet has fallen the tallest still standing 
is more than 75 feet high the height of a 10story building 
they were built when a a flourishing kingdom existed around 500 
bc in axum 341 miles north of addis ababa in wartorn tigray 
province the king and his subjects embraced coptic christianity in 
330 ad during the middle ages this kingdom gave way through 
palace feuds and intrigues to others in the south 
however by 1636 gondar had become the capital of centralized 
authority in the mountainous region giving ethiopia a political 
entity long before european colonization 
mayor said ethiopias monuments are treasures a legacy of 
civilizations spanning more than 40 centuries 
anyone who sees the state into which the masterworks have 
fallen would shudder and move into action to preserve these and 
other jewels of ethiopias past for the common enrichment of present 
and future generations he said 
he appealed to the international community to contribute money 
equipment and services for the restoration 
the 50state organization of african unity announced from its 
addis ababa headquarters the first donation of 10000 to help 
restore treasures of one of the continents most ancient 
civilizations 
ethiopian culture minister ghirma yilma said his countrys rich 
cultural history had attracted scholars from many parts of the 
world ethiopian artifacts and art are to be found in museums all 
over the world he noted 
ghirma said the government established after a 1974 coup ousted 
the late emperor haile selassie was keen to see the ancient 
monuments restored 
gondar lalibella and axum form the ethiopian tourist 
orgnizations northern historic route however tourism there 
has been handicapped since the rebel tigrean peoples liberation 
army took up arms against the government 14 years ago demanding 
more autonomy for the province 
mayor took issue with reporters who asked whether money spent on 
restoration of ancient monuments could not be better spent on people 
affected by natural calamities like the droughts and famines which 
intermittently afflict the east african nation 
guaranteeing opportunities to learn about and share our common 
heritage is also indispensable he said

the physician who operated on former sen john 
tower said the colon surgery shouldnt interfere with his serving as 
secretary of defense in presidentelect george bushs cabinet 
sen tower is in excellent health and he should expect a 100 
percent recovery dr rd dignan said friday and i see no 
reason whatsoever why he cant pick up where he left off 
dignan and other doctors removed a polyp and a onefoot section 
of towers colon during a threehour operation thursday the polyp 
and section of colon appear to be benign doctors said although 
final reports from an analysis of the growth and tissue were not 
expected to be available until today 
there is little chance of previously detected malignant cells 
resurfacing dignan added 
tower 63 appointed defense secretarydesignate by bush on dec 
16 was listed in good condition friday night hospital officials 
said 
the former republican senator is expected to remain hospitalized 
another seven or eight days and dignan has recommended that he rest 
in dallas another four or five days after being released 
doctors discovered the colon polyp dec 27 when physicians 
performed a colonoscopy and removed a cancerous rectal polyp they 
had discovered in november 
all of the malignant cells from the rectal polyp have been 
removed and there is nothing but a high likelihood that a cure has 
been achieved i think it would be the remotest possibility that he 
would have any additional trouble dignan said 
dignan said the surgical procedure is standard for a broadbase 
polyp and similar to surgery performed on president reagan 
physicians also removed lymph nodes and a small portion of 
towers small intestine 
tower must return for regular examinations to insure that other 
polyps do not develop but will not be expected to make any changes 
in his diet or take any prescription medicine

as an arms negotiator for president reagan and headed the white 
houses irancontra investigative panel

when emperor hirohito announced japans surrender 
over the radio in 1945 his voice until then unheard by commoners 
shocked a nation battered by countless bombings and exhausted by a 
war it could not win 
but later in his reign the emperors voice and appearances on 
television became part of the nations yearly routine showing the 
transformation of hirohitos role from aloof god to gentle symbol 
retired shopkeeper tadashi fujii recalled the emperors aug 15 
announcement when i heard the broadcast i just didnt believe it 
i couldnt believe it was the emperor 
said fujii 65 then in the imperial navy some people thought 
he was a god we were educated to think of him as a deity but when 
we heard his voice on the radio with all the static many of us were 
just relieved that the war was all over that we could go home 
when hirohito assumed the throne in 1926 the ancient idea that 
the emperor was a direct descendant of the sun goddess had been 
rejuvenated and hammered into the minds of the japanese by 
19thcentury reformers who sought to overthrow feudalism and justify 
their modern approach to government 
the reformers realized that though the emperor and imperial 
family have rarely wielded power no government has been able to 
rule without their tacit approval 
historians agree that the emperors of japan have not held real 
power since the ninth century the meiji restoration of 1868 is 
named after the meiji emperor but he was then only 15 and it was 
his ministers who made all the changes that created modern japan 
the reformers constitution of 1889 on paper at least declared 
hirohitos grandfather the meiji emperor to be sacred inviolable 
and the supreme authority in all matters of government 
wartime militarists built on the godemperor image turning it 
into impetus to keep the nation fighting in the wars final days 
hirohito did assert himself telling generals i cannot bear to 
see my innocent people suffer any longer 
the postwar constitution largely imposed by us occupation 
authorities redefined the emperors role he became the symbol 
of the state and of the people the emperor himself told the nation 
he was not a divinity in 1946 
during the allied occupation gen douglas macarthur chose to 
deny a request by the emperor to step down and take responsibility 
for the war opting instead to get him out among the people to help 
create an egalitarian society 
the emperor responded in 1946 by embarking on a 165day trek 
around the country covering all provinces but okinawa 
his travels in the provinces right after the war played a key 
role in boosting morale and unifying the japanese said toshiaki 
kawahara a journalist and author specializing in the imperial 
family he met the people talked to them 
and the imperial will as interpreted by macarthur continued long 
after the occupation ended in 1952 and japan took control of its own 
destiny 
the emperor served as a symbol and a uniting factor in the 
nations redevelopment kawahara said 
by opening the chrysanthemum throne to an extent never before 
seen hirohitos postwar reign also symbolized the nations growing 
democratization kawahara said 
each year since 1958 to celebrate the new year and hirohitos 
birthday on april 29 the grounds of the imperial palace in tokyo 
were opened to swarms of japanese seeking a glimpse of the monarch 
who would wave and give a short speech 
one year after these public appearances began the emperor 
allowed his son crown prince akihito to marry a commoner the 
break with tradition greatly enhanced the popularity of the imperial 
family 
but direct contact with common japanese became more infrequent as 
hirohito aged 
the ambivalence of the nations young people toward the emperor 
and the imperial system was reflected by a 25yearold office 
worker toshiko kodama who said i feel nothing but pity for him 
he was so weak

a polish trawler captain who was afraid his sailors 
might try to jump ship in boston harbor refused to enter the port 
but 16 crewmen determined to flee their homeland simply hopped 
aboard a refueling barge 
the sailors decision to jump ship thursday was the latest in a 
wave of defections that immigration officials say is unusual and 
puzzling fortyeight sailors all members of polands banned 
solidarity union have fled from three polish fishing vessels in 
boston in the last month us immigration and naturalization 
service officials said 
ship jumping is a very common occurrence in all us ports but 
even so i dont remember hearing of these kind of numbers said 
verne jervis a spokesman for the ins in washington 
jervis said he could not understand the defections because if 
anything things in poland have improved in recent years 
the sailors who applied for political asylum friday said the 
decision was easy the opportunity difficult 
between bites of pepperoni pizza at bostons polishamerican 
club tadeusz waliszewski 36 said he had been thinking for more 
than two years of defecting to the united states and decided to make 
the jump as soon as the trawler kantar reached boston from halifax 
nova scotia 
however he and his shipmates feared their chance might slip away 
when the captain canceled a twoday shore leave for the 57man crew 
and refused to enter bostons inner harbor 
he said there would be no leave because they were worried 
about more defections waliszewski said through an interpreter 
so he stayed out in the harbor but he had to send for a fuel 
barge 
at that point when we saw the barge coming we went to the 
captain and told him there were 12 of us who were going to defect 
no matter what he said we asked for our passports and other 
documents he refused to give them to us but we were determined 
and we just took our bags and left 
andrei kryzianowka 27 said the captain warned the defectors 
that their families in poland would face hefty fines but he did not 
physically try to block them 
even if the captain had wanted to he couldnt have gotten 
anyone to help him kryzianowka said 
not all the defectors got away at once 
the barge pulled away after the first dozen men had jumped onto 
it the other four jumped ship when it returned three hours later 
polishamerican families have offered to take the sailors in 
while the ins reviews their applications for political asylum said 
cathryn macinnes an immigration consultant to the city 
all the sailors will receive temporary work permits but 
permanent asylum will be granted only if they can prove they would 
face persecution upon their return to poland said timothy a 
whelan deputy director of the ins in boston 
thirteen polish sailors who fled two vessels after docking in 
boston in january 1988 were granted political asylum by april under 
what the federal government considers an expedited process ms 
macinnes said 
waliszewski said most of the sailors left wives and children 
behind but are hopeful that their families will be allowed to join 
them eventually 
of course its very hard he said i did talk about it 
with my wife but at this point she doesnt know i actually am here 
we all have families and were all thinking about them now

727s 
washington ap the federal aviation administration wants 
airlines to replace thousands of rivets on more than 600 older 
boeing 727s the goverment also wants them to initiate inspection 
procedures until the modifications can be completed 
the faa estimated friday that the repairs and extra inspections 
of 623 older boeing 727s will cost the airlines approximately 357 
million 
the proposed directive on the boeing 727s requires that airlines 
over the next four years replace from 3300 to 4150 rivets 
depending on the model of 727 involved it said the countersunk 
rivets now on the planes are believed to cause cracking under some 
circumstances while the substitute buttonhead is less likely 
to do so 
the proposed faa directive is similar to an order issued last 
october for older boeing 737s a final order will not be issued 
until after a brief comment period

the united states and libya engaged in a 
verbal dogfight in the security council over the authenticity of 
photos that washington says prove a libyan mig was armed when it was 
shot down by us jets 
the us envoy said friday the photographs clearly show a libyan 
aircraft armed with missiles not as he put it a bouquet of 
flowers he said the us pilots acted in selfdefense after using 
evasive air maneuvers five times to try to avoid the approaching 
jets 
the libyan envoy called the photographs fakes fabricated 
pictures directed in a hollywood manner by actors and clever 
editors libya says the planes were unarmed reconnaissance craft 
the already bad relations between the united states and libya 
worsened in recent weeks with us assertions that col moammar 
gadhafis government is ready to begin production of chemical 
weapons in a desert factory outside tripoli libya says the plant is 
designed to make pharmaceuticals 
washingtons un ambassador vernon a walters dramatically 
exhibited two blurred photographs friday that he said showed 
missiles under the wings and fuselage of one of the two sovietbuilt 
mig23s shot down by two us f14 tomcats on wednesday over 
international waters of the mediterranean sea 
us officials say they believe the other plane was similarly 
armed 
the photographs were passed around the council during the 
session which libya had sought in order to condemn the united 
states the session adjourned until monday morning 
the united states and its british ally are expected to veto the 
resolution of condemnation drafted by the 101nation nonaligned 
movement 
about 25 speakers mostly from arab and nonaligned nations have 
denounced the us action in the un session no one has supported 
it but us allies have not yet spoken 
libya says the us government wants to provoke a libyan 
retaliation so it can launch a fullscale attack 
us planes raided two libyan cities in 1986 to retaliate for 
purported libyan support of terrorism in connection with the bombing 
of a west german disco frequented by us servicemen 
a spokesman for libyan information minister rajab abou dabbous 
said friday that 14 us planes not two attacked the libyan 
craft 
the united states says the photographs were taken from videotape 
of the encounter made by the pilot of one of the us aircraft it 
says they show two views of a single aircraft armed with aphid and 
apex missiles 
however not everyone was convinced on friday soviet ambassador 
alexander m belonogov told the council that the us military 
action was absolutely unfounded 
he said the photographs were blurred and added its immaterial 
whether the libyan planes carried any missiles or were just pure 
reconnaissance planes we cannot recognize the right of a 
military plane of one country to shoot down a military aircraft of 
another country just because they both happen to be very close to 
each other in international airspace 
im not going to get into a hassle over the quality of image 
walters retorted after libya criticized his evidence the 
important thing is that us aircraft made five evasive maneuvers to 
turn away from the oncoming migs 
if you are walking down a dark alley at night and you see a man 
who has a gun and you cross the street and he crosses the street 
you slow down and he slows down you speed up and he speeds up 
youve got to realize that hes not coming to present you with a 
bouquet of flowers said walters 
he said the us planes were on a routine mission and acted in 
selfdefense 
however the libyan envoy reminded the 15member council that in 
july a us warship shot down an iranian commercial airliner in the 
persian gulf because crewmen mistakenly believed it to be an 
attacking warplane all 290 people on the plane were killed 
we are in the country of hollywood he told reporters it 
is very well edited very well done and it is not true

a man who hijacked a jetliner to 
cuba and spent five years in prison there has been sentenced to 
spend another five years in a us prison 
robert richter 31 of suburban chicago received the sentence 
friday from us district judge william zloch who rejected a 
federal probation officers recommendation to let richter remain 
free on probation 
richter hijacked an air florida flight from fort lauderdale on 
july 7 1983 when he was 26 years old and reportedly fascinated 
with cuba 
less than 24 hours earlier the us government said it had 
received word that cuba was cracking down on hijackers and that any 
sky pirates landing there could expect to spend 50 years in a cuban 
prison 
when richter returned to the united states in june he pleaded 
innocent to us charges he later changed his plea 
richters odyssey began when he boarded air florida flight 8 at 
fort lauderdalehollywood international airport he used a fake bomb 
to force the crew to take the boeing 737 to havana instead of tampa 
its scheduled destination air florida is now defunct 
richter was arrested tried convicted and sentenced to 20 years 
in prison he probably would still be in the prison in cuba if not 
for the efforts of his father chicago businessman john richter 
neither richters father nor the fbi have discussed how richters 
release was achieved but the fbi has insisted that the us 
government was not involved in the negotiations 
since his return from cuba richter has been free on a 250000 
bond signed by his father and has worked for his fathers business

the us government has turned south 
texas into a detention camp with a ruling that prevents central 
american immigrants from traveling to other areas to apply for 
asylum a lawsuit contends 
the lawsuit filed friday in us district court in brownsville 
seeks to reverse immigration and naturalization service rules of 
dec 16 that made it impossible for most asylumseekers to leave 
south texas or work while waiting 30 days for approval or denial of 
their claims 
in essence south texas has been transformed into a de facto 
detention area and asylum applicants are trapped there says the 
lawsuit which was filed on behalf of central americans and other 
asylumseekers in the ins harlingen district at the southern tip of 
texas 
before dec 16 asylumseekers in harlingen were allowed to 
travel to their us destinations to apply for asylum often miami 
or los angeles ins officials said they adopted the new procedure in 
harlingen to reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curb 
abuses of the system that delayed processing for legitimate asylum 
cases 
at least 30000 central americans passed through the area last 
year according to ins figures most of them enter the united states 
illegally in the brownsville area of the lower rio grande valley 
the nearest land point to central america 
due to the new policy to process these cases in harlingen 
severe backlogs have been created and hundreds of refugees are 
forced to sleep overnight on the sidewalk outside the ins office so 
as not to lose their place in line the lawsuit said many are 
sleeping in empty lots and eating from garbage bins many are 
traveling with small children who also are forced to endure winter 
elements without shelter 
the lawsuit names us attorney general richard thornburgh and 
ins commissioner alan nelson as defendants 
ins officials in washington declined to comment 
us district judge filemon vela of brownsville has agreed to 
hear a motion monday for a temporary restraining order said robert 
rubin managing attorney for the immigrant and refugee rights 
project for the san francisco lawyers committee for urban affairs 
the order would again allow asylumseekers to pursue their cases 
at their destinations where the attorneys said many have families 
and friends to help them 
the lawsuit accuses the ins of implementing a policy change 
without publishing it in the federal register for public comment of 
denying aliens access to the asylum process and access to counsel 
and improperly restricting the right to work

prosecutors in the pentagon procurement 
investigation say an initial 27count indictment is just the start 
of an expected wave of court activity in the prosecution phase of 
operation ill wind 
us attorney henry hudson of the eastern district of virginia 
said the pace of the investigation that began more than two years 
ago is moving with unprecedented speed given the complexity of the 
case 
in the next few months you will see a great deal of additional 
activity he said 
on friday a federal grand jury filed the first charges in the 
procurement case accusing a defense contractor a navy employee and 
five other men with crimes including conspiracy bribery and theft 
of government property 
hudson who is leading the nationwide investigation into the 
defense departments 150 billionayear purchasing system said the 
indictment strikes at the very heart of alleged corruption in 
the procurement process 
kenneth walton an fbi official said the no 1 priority of 
the bureaus white collar crime program is fraud in the defense 
department 
the 86page indictment focuses on activities alleged to have been 
undertaken by teledyne electronics of newbury park calif a branch 
of teledyne inc of los angeles and three men navy procurement 
specialist stuart e berlin and private consultants fred h lackner 
and william l parkin a former navy acquisitions official 
specifically the indictment charges that teledyne and three of 
its officers agreed to pay parkin 160000 to assist them in 
obtaining a navy contract related to radar worth 100 million 
the indictment contends parkin paid lackner a californiabased 
private consultant who in turn paid stuart e berlin for his 
assistance in manipulating the procurement process to insure that 
the contract was awarded to teledyne hudson said 
berlin participated in various decisions within the navy 
affecting the contract and is accused of giving teledyne advance 
information so the company could tailor its bids hudson said 
if convicted of all charges berlin parkin and lackner could 
face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of 55 
million each hudson told a news conference teledyne faces a fine 
of up to 65 million 
also named in the indictment were teledyne employees george h 
kaub eugene r sullivan and dale schnittjer they could face 
confinement ranging between 50 and 85 years and fines of up to 25 
million if convicted on all counts 
the overall conspiracy charge says the defendants worked together 
to defraud the navy and the air force to bribe a public official 
to make false statements and to commit wire fraud 
in advance of the indictment teledynes attorney thomas patten 
said the company had been offered a deal by the government but was 
unsatisfied with the terms attorneys for parkin and lackner have 
contended their clients did nothing wrong and would be vindicated in 
court 
before the indictment was returned another company hazeltine a 
division of emerson electric co agreed to plead guilty in us 
district court to conspiracy to defraud the united states 
conversion of government property and making false statements to the 
government company attorney scott muller said 
under terms of the agreement hazeltine which is cooperating with 
the government agreed to pay fines of nearly 2 million including 
court costs 
two former hazeltine employees joseph colarusso 58 who was the 
companys senior vice president and charles furciniti 54 who was 
a marketing representative also pleaded guilty to one count of 
conspiracy to defraud the government and commit wire fraud 
the maximum sentence they could face is five years in jail and a 
250000 fine us district judge claude m hilton set sentencing 
for march 17 
michael savaides 41 an employee of teledyne electronics 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery he too could be 
sentenced to five years in prison and a 250000 fine 
prosecutors said those pleading guilty had agreed to cooperate 
with the government in exchange for reduced charges all had a 
relationship with parkin and lackner the consultants who allegedly 
paid bribes to berlin 
investigators said hazeltine hired parkin to obtain inside 
information from pentagon employees that would allow the company to 
compete for a 159 million contract for battlefield equipment 
hazeltine said in a statement that it has already taken 
additional steps to enforce its longstanding requirement of ethical 
business behavior and to guard against such incidents in the 
future 
federal agents used telephone wiretaps in the case which was 
first made public last june when agents searched offices and homes 
of people suspected to be involved 
at the pentagon defense officials said the navy is reviewing 
all information released in connection with the indictments 
announced by the justice department to determine any necessary 
action regarding navy programs personnel contractors or 
consultants

world leaders from president reagan to malaysias king mourned 
todays death of emperor hirohito who surrendered a broken nation 
to the allies in world war ii but presided over its rise to economic 
preeminence 
reaction to hirohitos death at age 87 however was decidedly 
cool in several asian countries including south korea which 
endured years of harsh colonial rule by japan 
while south korea president roh taewoo sent his condolences a 
government party statement added we reserve further comment 
considering the unhappy past and the current koreajapan 
relationship 
the main opposition party led by kim daejung said we have 
complex feelings at the death of hirohito in view of japans 20year 
rule over korea during his reign 
a leading newspaper in seoul the joongang daily news wrote 
that hirohitos death reminds all the korean people of a disgraced 
period and humiliation hirohito is the symbolic figure who 
must assume most and final responsibility for japans preposterous 
crimes to the korean people 
korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist 
south in 1945 when us and soviet troops ended japans rule that 
began in 1910 with japans forced annexation of the peninsula 
there was no official comment from the nationalist chinese 
government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between 
taiwan and japan but the mass circulation chinese daily united 
evening news said 
asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of 
japans militarists during world war ii may bury their animosity 
with hirohitos death chinese suffered the most from the 
japanese invasion 
it was an irony that while hirohito apologized to the united 
states and europe for the war he did not direct a single word to 
china to show his sorrownow hirohito has died we may not want to 
collect the reparations but we shall never forget the painful 
historic lessions 
in the united states president reagan said in a statement his 
majestys 62year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous and yet 
at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind an 
age of unprecedented economic collapse a most vicious war 
astonishing scientific acheivement and dramatic political and 
social changes throughout the world 
it was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation his majesty 
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two 
peoples to an end reagan said referring to hirohitos decision 
to end world war ii 
in new zealand prime minister david lange said hirohitos death 
marks the end of an era 
during his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulent 
period in japans modern history to the stability and prosperity of 
today lange said 
president corazon aquino of the philippines sent condolences to 
the imperial family and her foreign secretary raul manglapus a 
japanese prisoner of war during world war ii praised hirohito as 
a stabilizing factor in the creation of a democratic japan 
he provided a figurehead that kept the japanese people firmly 
committed to peaceful means of achieving their national goals 
manglapus said 
condolences also came from king sultan mahmood iskandar of 
malaysia to hirohitos oldest son crown prince akihito who 
immediately ascended the chrysanthemum throne 
prime minister bob hawke of australia paid his respects in a 
message to japanese prime minister noburu takeshita throughout 
his long life the emperor was held in the highest esteem by his 
people now as japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for a 
new age our thoughts are with you 
but bruce ruxton an official of the returned services league 
which representing almost 300000 australian war veterans said 
there would not be too many tears shed around the world he 
described hirohito whose role in the war has been debated as one 
of the worst war criminals 
marine biologists paid homage to another facet of the monarchs 
life his 12 books published on hydrozoa or sea animals robert 
hessler of the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla 
calif said hirohito preferred the quiet study to his destined role 
as leader 
the poor man didnt really get to do what he wanted to do he 
had to be emperor first then second a scientist and normal human 
being hessler said

japans new imperial era was formally named 
heisei or achieving peace to set a new tone for emperor 
akihitos reign after the turbulence of his fathers 62year epoch 
the government announced today 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi announced the new name 
which will be used on calendars and official documents 
under a 1979 law and a custom dating back 1300 years a new 
name is assigned when a new emperor ascends japans 2600yearold 
chrysanthemum throne 
emperor hirohito died today of intestinal cancer after a 3month 
illness he was 87 
his oldest son akihito 55 immediately succeeded him 
heisei was chosen for akihitos reign because the word 
consisting of two chinese characters includes the meaning of 
achieving peace domestically internationally and in heaven prime 
minister noboru takeshita said in a statement 
i think it is the most appropriate era name to reflect the 
coming new age takeshita said 
the new era officially begins sunday with this year becoming 
heisei 1 the name was approved by takeshitas cabinet today and 
akihito signed with a calligraphy brush to give the measure formal 
effect 
reflecting japans postwar democratic constitution private 
citizens were included for the first time on the council that 
recommended three names for the new era to the cabinet the group 
also included cabinet ministers imperial household agency officials 
and scholars 
the opinion of the new emperor was not given much weight 
hirohitos reign which began dec 25 1926 was known as showa 
the era of enlightened peace by the japanese calendar this 
year was showa 64 
during the showa era hirohito saw his nation plunge into world 
war ii and suffer historys first atomic attack announced its 
surrender and later saw it rise to economic superpower status 
on the death of hirohito japans longestreigning monarch 
akihito succeeded automatically to the throne becoming the 125th 
emperor in the worlds oldest imperial line held by the same 
family since at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 bc 
in a ceremony a few hours after hirohito died akihito received 
three sacred treasures a sword jewels and the imperial seal 
that have been handed down through the centuries 
other ceremonies were expected to extend over at least two years 
ending with the formal enthronement 
a debate over naming the eras of japans emperors had flared 
between opposition parties and the conservative liberal democratic 
party which revived the eranaming clause in 1979 after it was 
dropped from the postwar constitution 
the socialist party and the communist party favor the exclusive 
use of the western calendar and charge that naming eras violates the 
constitutional provision that sovereignty rests with the japanese 
people 
the eranaming tradition was imported from china and reflected a 
belief that the sovereign controlled time itself

emperor hirohito played a major role in ending 
world war ii between japan and the united states according to 
documents in washington archives 
president reagan paid tribute to the actions of hirohito in 
helping to end the the hostilities and leading the japanese people 
through reconstruction after the mikado died on friday 
the japanese account of hirohitos role in the last days of the 
war was first made public when the state department in 1969 issued 
the 1945 volume in its continuing series of us diplomatic 
documents historians regard his acts then as one factor influencing 
the us decision against including the emperor among japanese 
leaders prosecuted for war crimes 
one lengthy report to washington describes the hirohito as 
changing his customary practice of acquiescing in all decisions of 
others to put the brakes on a futile war effort that was out of 
control 
after the collapse of germany it was obvious to japanese leaders 
that the war was lost but the force of militarism and the momentum 
which was carrying the war along were like a bicycle rolling down 
hill without brakes there was no way to stop it and the army itself 
did not know how to give up said the november 1945 account of 
the japanese version of events leading to surrender 
max w bishop a political adviser to gen douglas macarthur the 
supreme allied commander wrote the report quoting a long 
conversation with hisatsune sakomizu who was chief cabinet 
secretary under japans last wartime prime minister kantoro suzuki 
suzuki an admiral had been hirohitos aidedecamp for six 
years and had a personal friendship with the emperor unlike the 
earlier prime minister gen hideki tojo who was later convicted of 
war crimes and hanged 
thus hirohito for the first time was able to express his true 
feelings through the prime minister bishop quoted sakomizu as 
saying 
on august 9 the day nagasaki was bombed in historys second 
atomic attack suzuki decided that nuclear weapons and the soviet 
unions entry into the war provided needed justification for ending 
the conflict the emperor agreed that the war should be brought to 
an end on the basis of the allied potsdam declaration the 
account said 
it continued six top leaders discussed accepting potsdam and 
deadlocked prime minister suzuki the navy and foreign ministers 
favored acceptance provided only that the emperor was retained the 
war minister and the army and navy chiefs of staffs insisted on two 
other conditions that allied forces not occupy japan and that 
japan be allowed to bring home its forces without surrendering them 
abroad 
unable to get the customary consensus suzuki went to the 
emperor who called an imperial conference at 11 pm deadlock 
continued with the prime minister supported 43 
always before it had been the custom for a conference to reach 
a decision without directly involving the emperor but because of 
the close division suzuki asked him to decide said the report 
bishop said sakomizu quoted the mikado as speaking out for peace 
and giving his reasons 
1 from the very start of the war the plans and information of 
the military had been far removed from the facts of the true 
situation 
2 that to continue the war would mean the destruction of the 
japanese people and the country and would also be disastrous to 
world civilization and 
3 termination of the war in this manner at this time was in 
accordance with the will of god and the destiny of the world 
early aug 10 the imperial government messaged acceptance of 
potsdam with the understanding that the emperor would be retained a 
reply three days later said the ultimate form of government would 
depend on the freely expressed will of the japanese people 
suzuki favored immediate final acceptance but most of the 
military again unalterabily opposed hirohito on his own 
initiative called another imperial conference for aug 14 at which 
he asked all to accept his decision to issue an imperial rescript 
ending the war 
it was readied at 11 pm and the emperor decided on his historic 
broadcast directly to the people 
sakomizu also gave details of alreadyknown unsuccessful moves by 
diehard army officers to prevent the broadcast by sealing off the 
palace during the night of august 15 attacking the prime ministers 
official residence and burning the homes of suzuki and baron 
kiichiro hiranuma the privy council president who had favored peace 
on august 16 the stunned populace for the first time heard 
hirohitos voice declare that the war has developed not 
necessarily to japans advantage and was over

a senior member of afghanistans 
sovietstyle ruling party said today that deposed king zahir shah 
could play a role in ending the afghan war but president najib would 
not resign 
najmuddin kawyani one of 14 politburo members of the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan accused antigovernment guerrillas 
of blocking efforts to form a broadbased government 
leaders of the afghan moslem resistance who have been meeting 
this week in pakistan with the soviet first deputy foreign minister 
yuli vorontsov vehemently reject the participation of najib and his 
party in any future government 
najib will not resign and we have not heard any such thing 
from moscow kawyani told a news conference at the afghan embassy 
in new delhi 
najib told western journalists in kabul last month he was willing 
to do anything to bring peace to his country as soviet forces 
withdraw but he avoided saying whether that included resigning 
kawyani who comes from najibs own parchami faction of the 
party said i must emphasize that without the participation of 
the peoples democratic party of afghanistan peace is impossible 
asked about zahir shah the deposed monarch whom vorontsov met in 
italy last month kawyani said 
the peoples democratic party of afghanistan is of the view 
that the exking zahir shah can play a role in a political 
settlement of afghanistan were waiting for him to express a 
point of view were interested in a settlement the return of zahir 
shah does not mean a return of the monarchy 
zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 by his cousin mohammad daoud 
who was killed five years later in the coup that installed the 
sovietbacked government in 1979 soviet troops intervened in 
afghanistan to help defend the government from moslem guerrilla 
attacks 
in the last few years the party has sought to distance itself 
publicly from its marxist beginnings but the moslem resistance 
movement composed of seven pakistanbased parties and eight 
iranbased parties routinely refers to the party as godless 
communists 
zahir shah is increasingly mentioned as the only afghan leader 
with sufficient stature to serve as even a symbolic leader 
vorontsov met resistance leaders in saudi arabia on dec 3 
giving the guerrillas the kremlins first public recognition as a 
negotiating force for afghanistans future 
the guerrillas have been fighting kabuls government since the 
1978 coup with arms supplied by the united states pakistan china 
and several arab nations the guerrillas also attacked soviet forces 
that numbered 115000 a year ago 
the soviets started withdrawing troops last may under a 
unsponsored accord signed in geneva the remaining 50000 red 
army soldiers are scheduled to leave afghanistan by feb 15 under 
the accord 
kawyani in his late 30s with a black mustache reminiscent of 
josef stalin accused the united states and pakistan of violating 
the geneva accord by continuing to arm the guerrillas 
he demanded pakistan stop providing shelter for the guerrillas 
the seven mujahedeen parties based in pakistan openly maintain 
offices in peshawar 20 miles from the afghan border 
a council of peace should be formed from all the involved 
parties kawyani said another option is an international 
conference under the auspices of the united nations

the grandson of soviet revolutionary leader 
leon trotsky back from his first visit to the soviet union in a 
halfcentury said the soviet attitude toward his grandfather is 
full of contradictions 
however esteban volkow bronstein said the fact that he was 
granted a visa indicated a slight improvement in his grandfathers 
status 
volkow said friday that he spent five days in moscow last month 
visiting alexandra zakharonavna his halfsister and trotskys 
granddaughter 
shes very gravely ill with cancer said volkow 
nevertheless he said they had a happy reunion volkow said he 
hadnt seen his sister since he fled the soviet union with his 
mother in 1931 when he was 5 years old 
volkow was living with trotsky in mexico city when the former 
head of the red army was assassinated on josef stalins orders on 
aug 20 1940 
trotsky born lev davidovich bronstein was one of the leaders of 
the october 1917 revolution that established the soviet union but 
he lost a power struggle with stalin and was exiled in 1929 
under stalinism trotsky was deemed a nonperson reviled in the 
soviet union 
it was only recently that trotskys reputation began to be 
revived as mikhail gorbachevs policy of glasnost gathered steam 
trotskys name is now sometimes mentioned in public and he is 
described as an enemy of stalin rather than an enemy of socialism 
and the revolution 
last year the soviet supreme court rehabilitated a son volkows 
uncle sergei sedov who was executed on stalins orders in 1937 the 
court ordered all charges against sedov dropped 
volkow said he traveled to moscow shortly after the earthquake 
last month that devastated armenia killing about 55000 people 
we had trouble getting seats there were so many people flying 
to moscow to help said volkow 
he said in addition to visiting his sister he met with about 500 
members of a group formed in trotksys memory he said he was also 
interviewed on videotape by ogonyonk the magazine on the leading 
edge of glasnost 
i dont know if theyll broadcast the videotape he said i 
think it was for use sometime in the future 
volkow a retired chemical engineer believes his grandfathers 
role in the founding of the soviet union should not be distorted or 
hidden 
volkow also said he left the soviet union at such a young age 
that he remembers almost nothing he now considers himself a mexican 
and said moscow was extremely cold 
it was all snow volkow said

japan will bury emperor hirohito after weeks of 
ceremonies that will follow closely the rituals and pageantry of his 
fathers funeral 62 years ago 
the formal state funeral is planned for feb 24 kyodo news 
service reported quoting government sources there was no immediate 
government announcement 
hirohito died today from intestinal cancer he was 87 
ceremonies to purify the mausoleum where hirohitos body will 
lay to enshrine his spirit and to mark the departure of the 
imperial hearse from the palace for the burial site are among 29 
funeral rites planned 
prime minister noboru takeshita will head a committee to decide 
funeral details 
hirohitos father emperor taisho was buried 45 days after his 
death on dec 25 1926 in an elaborate garden ceremony that 
included a funeral march of 6000 people 
although there have been many changes since then including 
major changes in the constitution in practical terms there wont be 
many alterations in the funeral rites a palace official said 
before hirohitos death 
that would mean there could be more than 61 different ceremonies 
rites and imperial court appearances extending over at least two 
years before his son akihitos formal ascension to japans 
2600yearold chrysanthemum throne 
many are directly linked to japans native shinto religion for 
which the emperor serves as chief priest 
hirohito was considered a living shinto god until allied 
occupation authorities forced him to renounce his divinity after 
world war ii the postwar constitution makes the emperor the 
symbol of state 
officials say hirohitos body will be placed in a casket two or 
three days after his death 
the funeral on a day that will be declared a national holiday 
will include a procession of top officials and foreign dignitaries 
to a royal burial ground 
in a departure from common japanese practice palace officials 
said the emperor will not be cremated 
government officials avoided talking about the funeral before 
hirohitos death believing it inappropriate while he was still 
battling his illness 
the 45day period after taishos death was likely related to the 
time required for foreign dignitaries to travel to japan since only 
boat transportation was available at the time the palace official 
said

in hawaii where onequarter of the population is of japanese 
descent emperor hirohito was remembered as a symbol of unity who 
helped japan emerge as a leading democracy in asia 
hirohito who reigned for 62 years died today of intestinal 
cancer at age 87 his eldest son crown prince akihito 55 
immediately became the 125th occupant of the chrysanthemum throne 
elsewhere friday americans made books of condolence in 
washington state and colorado as officials planned to mark his 
passing in ceremonies during the coming days 
in washington dc president reagan offered condolences and 
lauded hirohito for playing a truly heroic role in urging his 
country to surrender after the atomic bombing of japan by the united 
states at the close of world war ii 
mourning was most evident at the japanese consulate in honolulu 
where hirohito had planted a tree during a 1975 visit to the 
islands the japanese flag flew at halfstaff and officials 
monitored japanese radio accounts of hirohitos death 
consul general tadayuki nonoyama invited mourners to the 
consulate on monday and tuesday to sign a book of condolences for 
the royal family 
nonoyama said his own loss was made greater because he had known 
hirohito once serving as an interpreter in the royal household 
i have a deep affection for the emperor he was a very sincere 
man nonoyama said 
sen spark matsunaga dhawaii said he had great respect for 
hirohito with whom he met on several occasions 
the emperors role as a symbol of unity contributed to the 
miracle performed by the japanese people in developing their country 
as the leading democratic nation in postwar asia politically 
economically and culturally matsunaga said 
honolulu mayor frank fasi said hirohito will long be remembered 
as the god who became a man and through his personal humility 
brought respect and dignity out of the tragedy of war 
in seattle plans to mark hirohitos passing would be formalized 
next week said christine rose assistant director of the japan 
america society of the state of washington seattles japanese 
consulate also would have a book of condolences for signing she 
said 
in california japaneseamericans voiced restrained sympathy over 
the monarchs passing 
i suspect that in a way the japaneseamericans who are living 
in the us may take the death a little more seriously or hard 
said peter duus professor of modern japanese history at stanford 
university 
when the older generation left japan the emperor was almost 
like a russian czar surrounded by religious awe and the younger 
generation here as a result have a wonderful timecapsule picture 
of the japan their parents knew duus added 
leon kimura president of the japaneseamerican citizens leagues 
san jose chapter said this is a shock even though we knew he was 
sick 
even though we are japaneseamericans there is still some 
strong feelings for our homeland kimura said 
in colorado japanese residents planned a ceremony monday to 
memorialize the emperor but the states buddhist community planned 
no commemoration to avoid misunderstanding over hirohitos wartime 
role 
joe ozaki vice president of the japanese association of 
colorado said the organization made arrangements for a kicho 
or memorial ceremony for the states 7000 japanese to bow before a 
portrait of the emperor and sign a condolence book on monday at 
sakura square a japanese commercial area in downtown denver

col moammar gadhafi made a surprise 
appearance today at a hotel filled with foreign journalists and 
vowed that libya would not yield to us pressure for a million 
years 
gadhafis unannounced arrival at tripolis top hotel was his 
first public appearance since us jetfighters on wednesday shot 
down two libyan sovietbuilt migs over the mediterranean 
according to sources in the capital gadhafi had not been seen in 
public for several weeks a period of sharply increased tensions 
between the united states and libya over us allegations the 
libyans had constructed a chemical weapons factory in the desert 60 
miles southwest of tripoli 
gadhafi has insisted the plant will manufacture medicine us 
president reagan has said he could not rule out a military strike 
against the site at rabta 
his recent disappearance from view had prompted speculation that 
fearing a us attack he had fled the capital possibly going to a 
refuge in the desert 
gadhafis fortified headquarters in tripoli which include a 
residence of the leader was bombed by the united states in april 
1986 to retaliate for libyas alleged support of terrorism 
about 200 reporters mobbed gadhafi who was ringed by bodyguards 
when he appeared in one of the hotels lobby lounges speaking 
softly for about five minutes he gave a statement in arabic whose 
translation was not immediately available 
then he answered some of the journalists shouted questions a 
man from libyas official news agency jana translated some of his 
replies in arabic into english 
libya is opposing the use of chemical weapons gadhafi said 
in his only comment on issue in the questionandanswer period 
asked how he felt he said only im fine 
his curly hair was topped by a black wool pillbox hat he wore a 
maroonandblue sweater covered by a brown wool cape to protect 
him against tripolis rainy weather 
asked about the us pressures on his country he vowed never to 
bow to the americans even if this confrontation lasts 1 million 
years 
the unexpected sight of a smiling gadhafi in the hotel set off 
chaos journalists and camera crews knocked over potted plants 
scrambled atop chairs and climbed over a twostoryhigh ornamental 
fountain inside the lobby 
the libyan government challenging us justifications for the 
downing of two libyan jets has claimed its planes were overwhelmed 
by 14 hostile american aircraft 
a government spokesman said the us assertion that two american 
jets had acted in selfdefense after being dogged in the air by the 
libyan mig23s was a fabrication 
washington has provided television stations with videotape said 
to be from wednesdays attack as taken by one of us aircraft and 
has shown blurred photographs to the un security council of what 
it said was a libyan plane carrying four bombs that was downed in 
the encounter 
the council met in emergency session thursday and friday to 
consider libyas request for a condemnation of the us act the 
council is to resume its session monday morning 
libyan un envoys have contended the planes were unarmed and on 
a simple reconnaissance mission 
in other developments 
at least two mig23 jet fighters sat at tripolis airport 
friday poised to enter the takeoff runway a day earlier no 
military planes were seen on any runway increased security was 
noted at the headquarters of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
a western diplomat in tripoli said he believed the united states 
and libya had had contacts through a third country to defuse the 
tension 
reports circulated that gadhafi had ousted his military chief 
but the reports could not be confirmed 
rajab abou dabbous secretary of the information ministry told a 
news conference friday that the us navy jets launched a 
premeditated attack 
he disputed washingtons account that the two planes which were 
attached to the us navys 6th fleet were threatened by the libyan 
migs 
the truth is that 14 count them attacked two libyan planes 
on a normal reconnaissance flight said dabbous 
the us statements of the last couple of weeks show a 
pattern of premeditation he added it is not by chance the 
us fleet was off our coast 
tensions between the united states and libya have been high over 
washingtons charges that gadhafi is on the verge of full chemical 
weapons production the united states has threatened to bomb the 
plant it says is involved 
in a special program friday night official libyan television 
said while the libyan jets were carrying out their duties 
seven groups of hostile american aircraft suddenly appeared at 1100 
hours 
it said the us planes flew away but one pair suddenly 
reappeared and fired at our aircraft while they were in their 
regular flight 
the television program and jana said the issue was not whether 
the libyan planes were carrying missiles but one of us 
premeditated aggression

attorneys representing the estate of rock 
hudson portrayed a companion of the actor who died of aids as an 
opportunist who threatened to go public with the love letters hudson 
had written him 
but a lawyer for marc christian said his client was victimized by 
the actor who died in october 1985 because hudson concealed 
knowledge of his incurable and contagious disease 
hudsons secretary mark miller hid hudsons disease from 
christian until the whole world heard about it attorney harold 
rhoden told jurors friday in christians 11 million lawsuit 
marc christian got a call from mark miller in france said 
rhoden he said im sorry the movie star told me not to tell 
you i know its not fair but i was only following orders 
rhoden said the trial would focus on whether hudson had a duty to 
warn his sexual partner that he had aids and whether christian 
should be compensated for emotional distress and the enhanced 
fear that he too had been infected 
the estates attorney robert mills said christian has not 
developed aids which supports his theory that the affair ended 
shortly after it began 
if he doesnt have aids what motivation is there for suing 
he asked and if it wasnt a movie star of rock hudsons stature 
would he be suing 
millers lawyer andrew banks said miller had vowed to keep 
hudsons illness secret from everyone including christian 
this was a man rock hudson trusted closer than he would trust a 
brother he said when rock hudson learned he had aids he 
turned to this friend he trusted with this terrible secret because 
it would be safe 
but he said miller did not believe that hudson was continuing to 
have sex with christian 
rock hudson told mark miller they were not having sex that 
they hadnt had sex since february 1984 banks said 
he also quoted hudson as telling miller give the kid what he 
wants he has letters 
banks said christian lived off hudson as he lived off a woman 33 
years his senior with whom he had an affair 
what the evidence is going to show said banks is he 
christian is interested in the will money and publicity 
when the rock hudson gravy train ended and mr hudson died 
marc christian filed this suit because the will had been probated 
and he wasnt in it he said 
attorneys for miller and the hudson estate contend the love 
affair between hudson and christian soured in early 1984 because 
christian told hudson he had sold sex for money they said hudson 
stopped having sex with christian and allowed him to stay in his 
home for the next 18 months only because christian threatened to 
expose the stars homosexuality 
rhoden said hudson deluded his lover by hiding his disease and 
was protected by miller who told christian that hudson had 
anorexia not aids 
rhoden described a tender 2year love affair that began when 
hudson and christian met at a political fundraiser in october 1982 
christian was 28 and hudson 56 
in early 1983 hudson said he was falling in love with 
christian and that he hadnt felt this way since he was in high 
school rhoden said 
the men engaged in sex three to five times a week with neither 
man using a condom rhoden said hudson developed symptoms of aids a 
year later including rashes and sores profuse sweating and rapid 
weight loss 
hudson was diagnosed with aids in june 1984 but decided not to 
tell christian rhoden said

the number of azerbaijanis who fled neighboring 
armenia to their homeland in the face of ethnic unrest and a 
devastating earthquake has swelled to 160000 an azerbaijani 
official said today 
thousands of the refugees are camping in schools clubs and other 
public buildings as they await resettlement said azerbaijan foreign 
ministry spokesman bagirov who did not give his first name 
others have been placed in new jobs and housing all over the 
azerbaijan he said although officials are still trying to persuade 
both azerbaijani and armenian refugees to return home 
the refugee situation in neighboring armenia is much worse since 
the 90000 armenians who fled azerbaijan have been joined by half a 
million left homeless by the devastating dec 7 earthquake 
previous figures refugees issued in november said about 75000 
armenians and 75000 azerbaijanis had fled to their homelands 
ethnic violence between the moslem azerbaijanis and the christian 
armenians has torn the two southern soviet republics for the past 
year and the latest outbreak starting in november killed 43 people 
according to todays pravda 
bagirov said baku the azerbaijani capital was calm the 
atmosphere in the city was described as explosive during ethnic 
unrest just before the quake 
however chief investigator gen lt vk pankin of the national 
ministry of interior told pravda today the situation is still 
complicated 
his department has sent staffers from moscow and elsewhere in the 
soviet union to assist azerbaijani law enforcement personnel to 
ensure correct investigation of crimes he told pravda 
several armenian prosecutors were fired this week for failing to 
fulfill their duties 
authorities have begun filing criminal charges against those who 
committed acts of violence during the riots including murder and 
arson pankin said for example one teahouse manager has been 
arrested for inciting teenagers to riot and carry an islamic flag 
in demonstrations he said 
in baku authorities continue to detain 100 to 200 people a night 
for curfew violations bagirov said on friday for example 104 
people were held for violating the curfew and four were detained for 
inciting ethnic dissension where a curfew has been imposed 
about 15000 armenians have returned to baku after fleeing at the 
height of the violence and daily demostrations by azerbaijani 
nationalists bagirov said

emperor hirohito once venerated as a living god and 
made into the guiding spirit of a world war today died of 
intestinal cancer ending a 62year reign that saw his nation 
recover from ruin to riches he was 87 
crown prince akihito oldest of the emperors two sons became 
the 125th occupant of the chrysanthemum throne in a solemn 
wordless fourminute ceremony a sword jewels and the imperial 
seals were placed on a table in front of him and he bowed 
hirohito died without ever having shed much light on his world 
war ii role 
historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was required 
to approve decisions of the military leaders until he decided the 
japanese had suffered enough atomic bombing firebombing and 
invasion and personally announced surrender in august 1945 
his death followed a 3month illness during which reports on his 
blood pressure and temperature became fixtures of japanese routine 
and many festivities were postponed or canceled 
the government proclaimed a sixday formal mourning period and 
named the new emperors reign heisei or achieving peace hirohitos 
reign which began on dec 25 1926 was called showa or 
enlightened peace 
thousands of people signed condolence registers at the palace 
japans stock markets closed but banks and many shops remained open 
some clerks wore black ribbons to signify mourning but prepared 
by the monarchs long illness people generally reacted calmly 
in western japan however an 87yearold man hanged himself 
today leaving a note that said in part i want to follow the 
emperor in death police said 
kyodo news service said umanosuke ue a former imperial army 
soldier had been particularly proud of having been born in the same 
year as the emperor 
in western tokyo police arrested 10 members of the radical 
leftist chukakuha middle core faction on charges of assembling 
weapons for a demonstration against the nations monarchy 
about 100 faction members tried to demonstrate and some of 
those arrested tried to push through with bamboo rods against riot 
police said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said 15000 riot police were being mobilized around tokyo 
against possible sabotage 
about 90 people peacefully marched in another tokyo district with 
banners bearing such slogans as no more emperor and suggesting 
hirohito bore responsibility for the war 
i could not stand the thought that people outside japan are 
going to think everyone is crying over his death said 
organizer ryuichi harada it is about time we should learn that 
the image of him being a pacifist and warm and kind old man was 
forced on us 
the formal state funeral is planned for feb 24 kyodo news 
service reported quoting government sources there was no immediate 
government announcement 
until hirohitos death palace officials refused to acknowledge 
that the emperor was suffering from cancer japanese rarely inform 
cancer patients of their disease 
after fell seriously ill on sept 19 678 pints of blood 
transfusions helped keep hirohito alive 
in september 1987 hirohito had undergone intestinal bypass 
surgery but doctors had said that a growth found there was not 
cancerous 
with heartfelt sorrow i together with our people wish to 
express my deep sense of loss on the passing prime minister 
noboru takeshita said in a television address 
takeshita recounted hirohitos eventful and turbulent reign 
through the depression and the calamities of that deplorable war 
to unprecedented postwar economic growth 
he resolutely brought to an end the war that had broken out in 
spite of his wishes out of a determination to prevent further 
suffering of the people said takeshita 
in washington president reagan joined leaders worldwide in 
offering condolences reagan lauded hirohito for playing a truly 
heroic role in urging his country to surrender 
reaction to his death however was muted in south korea ruled 
harshly as a colony during 20 years of hirohitos rule and by some 
chinese who held hirohito accountable for the japanese invasion of 
china in world war ii 
hirohito died in the moatringed palace where he had stayed most 
of the time a remote figure who was known however as an eminent 
marine biologist and avid fan of sumo a traditional japanese form 
of wrestling 
hirohito wrote 12 books on hydrozoans small sea animals 
the worlds oldest imperial line held by the same family since 
at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 bc passed 
automatically to akihito 
if tradition is followed there will be more than 60 different 
ceremonies over the next two years until akihito is formally 
enthroned 
akihito 55 was schooled among commoners and in an upset to 
precedent married a commoner 
with princess michiko becoming the new empress hirohitos wife 
nagako 85 becomes empress dowager 
the new crown prince akihitos eldest son naruhito 28 formerly 
known as prince hiro also is a tennis player and studied at oxford 
university in england 
akihito has indicated he would lower some of the walls around the 
monarchy and he once reportedly told a friend i want to shake up 
the imperial protocol system

stores covered display windows with white cloth 
tokyos disneyland turned its music down and the stock market closed 
today in a show of commercial restraint as japan mourned the death 
of emperor hirohito 
and in western japan an 87yearold man hanged himself today 
leaving a note that said in part i want to follow the emperor in 
death 
but while shock and a flurry of cancellations followed the sudden 
worsening of hirohitos health in september his long illness had 
given japanese time to prepare for the end of his 62year era 
the government declared an official sixday mourning period and 
the ministry of education called on schools and athletic 
organizations to unite together to suitably mourn the emperor 
thousands of people lined up at the imperial palace to pray and 
sign their names on registries to express condolences for hirohito 
87 who died today of intestinal cancer 
of course its a shock i had hoped that the emperor would live 
as long as possible said masakichi koizumi 69 one of those in 
line but it was inevitable 
in downtown tokyo a group of about 90 people marched for about 
an hour protesting the imperial system of rule 
television newscasters changed into dark clothing to express 
mourning 
although stock exchanges canceled their regular halfday 
sessions banks department stores and chain stores remained open 
tokyo disneyland was open but played its music at half the 
normal volume 
most stores in tokyos normally garish ginza shopping district 
turned off their electric signs and erected japanese risingsun 
flags topped with black streamers at a mcdonalds restaurant 
clerks with black ribbons pinned to their lapels scurried to serve 
customers 
department stores covered their elaborate show windows with white 
sheets 
we thought it would be better given the circumstances to 
cover up the decorative displays said haruhisa hattori director 
of advertising at wako department store 
but not everyone supported the expressions of jishuku or 
selfrestraint 
i think its crazy to do things like that for someone who 
shared responsibility for world war ii said a 33yearold office 
worker pointing to the covered wako window i had hoped the 
emperor would apologize for the war before he died 
questions over hirohitos wartime role whether he was an active 
participant in planning the hostilities or merely used by 
militarists remain controversial in japan although most people 
express affection for the dead monarch and say they favor the 
emperor system 
the antiimperial protest went on for about an hour in downtown 
tokyo 
i could not stand the thought that people outside japan are 
going to think all japanese are emperor lovers and everyone is 
crying over his death said organizer ryuichi harada 
passersby looked uncomfortably at the marchers i dont 
believe it one said are they really japanese 
all major political parties expressed sorrow over the emperors 
death with the exception of the japan communist party which 
officially opposes the imperial system 
takako doi chairwoman of the japan socialist party the largest 
opposition group said the emperors reign was full of bitter 
experiences and shocks and pledged her party would work to use 
the lessons of history to achieve a permanent peace 
the sad news of the passing of his late majesty the emperor has 
left me griefstricken prime minister noboru takeshita said 
our sincere prayers for his recovery were in vain and i am at a 
loss for words 
hirohitos fifth daughter takako shimazu said her father had 
battled gallantly against his cancer i hope he now will be 
able to rest peacefully she said 
he wasnt a god but he was somehow different from ordinary 
people said hiroko gotoh 22 i dont think ive changed inside 
because of his death but i have a feeling an era has changed in 
japan

soviet deputy foreign minister yuli 
vorontsov said today moscow would find a way to support kabuls 
communist government after the withdrawal of the red army from 
afghanistan 
vorontsov told reporters a broadbased government representing 
all the political forces of afghanistan is the only way to 
guarantee peace after the remaining 50000 soviet troops depart the 
soviets are to withdraw by feb 15 
the soviet envoy dismissed claims by moslem insurgents as well 
as pakistani and western analysts that the ruling peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan will be toppled once soviet troops 
leave 
it will survive in its own right and you will know it after the 
withdrawal of the soviet forces said vorontsov we will be 
supporting them kabul communists if there is no broadbased 
government we will support the regime in kabul as the legal 
government of the republic of afghanistan 
we will find the way said vorontsov we will tell you 
later he refused to elaborate further 
afghan guerrillas who have been fighting the sovietbacked 
government for 10 years have promised to establish a council to 
choose a transitional government 
if thats going to be only a onesided council there is no 
value in it said vorontsov 
the alliance of seven afghan guerrilla groups headquartered in 
pakistan has said no afghan communists will be allowed to 
participate in their council 
pakistan which is giving refuge to more than 3 million afghans 
also dismissed the participation of the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan in a postwar government 
however vorontsov said the peoples democratic party has all 
the right to participate as a political force in that broadbased 
government 
they must be realistic he said of the guerrillas by 
puffing and huffing they will not be able to destroy the house of 
the present regime if we take the words of the famous fairy tale 
about the three little pigs 
vorontsov said the february withdrawal deadline would be met 
unless the guerrillas attack departing soviet soldiers 
it could be delayed if there were all out fighting on soviet 
forces if there were attacks on soviet forces withdrawing said 
vorontsov they will fight back to defend and will not withdraw 
the soviet soldiers are not running for their lives he said 
the kremlin sent more than 100000 soviet soldiers into 
afghanistan in december 1979 last april moscow agreed to withdraw 
them by feb 15 half had left by august 
vorontsov suggested the warring factions should look to the 
united nations to resolve the deadlock over afghans future 
government 
they have an important role to play even more important than 
ours he said of the united nations 
vorontsovs diplomatic mission began in early december when he 
met pakistanbased guerrillas in saudi arabia the only significant 
agreement to come out of that meeting was a decision to hold the 
islamabad talks the only agreement this time was to hold more talks

marketstyle economic reforms have brought new 
prosperity to china but have cost some women their jobs others 
their education and have revived traditional views that women should 
stay at home 
in the new atmosphere of competition and making money the 
40yearold official line that women should share equally in 
building socialism has been muted 
instead employers some local officials and even the influential 
peoples daily have said openly over the past year what many chinese 
believe privately women are more suited for housework and should be 
liberated from outside jobs 
among related developments 
many companies forced for the first time to make a profit are 
refusing to hire women both uneducated and college graduates 
saying they cant afford maternity benefits now that factories can 
fire workers they are cutting nearly two women for every man 
officials say 
single teenage girls in rural areas can still find jobs 
however and many peasant families are pulling them from school to 
go to work believing that only sons should be educated more than 
fourfifths of children not in school are girls officials say 
these trends which have emerged mainly over the past year are a 
startling aboutface in a society where nearly 70 percent of women 
work outside the home they have generated heated debate in chinese 
newspapers and protests from womens groups 
we advocate that women hold outside jobs said cai sheng a 
spokeswoman for the allchina womans federation an official 
organization concerned with womens issues this is the first step 
in liberation only then can women achieve political status and 
economic independence 
for thousands of years chinese womens roles were strictly 
defined by a confucian code that required obedience first to ones 
father then to ones husband rural women often worked in the 
fields alongside men but few were taught to read and write or 
played any role in the larger society 
many young urban women joined the political ferment that 
culminated in the communist victory in 1949 the communists outlawed 
the practice of binding womens feet mandated education of both 
boys and girls and encouraged women to work in building the new 
china 
but ms cai said traditional views of womens roles remained 
strong especially in the countryside comments by officials of some 
rural areas appear to buttress that contention 
if women dont stay home we men cant go to work with a 
light heart said li fengzhuang a spokesman for the government of 
daqiuzhuang village 
daqiuzhuang a community of 3550 people in the tianjin municipal 
region in east china has received favorable publicity from the 
peoples daily because nearly half the workingage women have become 
fulltime housewives in the decade since china began its newest 
economic reforms 
li said those reforms have increased prosperity in the village 
and made two incomes unnecessary 
by staying home women can liberate daqiuzhuangs 
productivity he said whats wrong with people doing what they 
do best its appropriate for women to do housework theyre more 
thorough its their specialty men have strong bodies and can do 
hard labor 
li said most of the housewives were illiterate and therefore made 
poor outside workers daqiuzhuang does offer education programs on 
closedcircuit television the subjects are cooking and cleaning 
wu yurong 35 one of daqiuzhuangs housewives said she once 
worked in a factory cafeteria and enjoyed it but she said she was 
underpaid and she now concentrates on caring for her two children 
10 and 14 and for her husband 
me go to work she asked a woman cant earn enough at 
the cafeteria she made 324 a year her husband now earns more than 
1620 as a workshop foreman more than twice the average workers 
salary 
although the peoples daily said approvingly that daqiuzhuang may 
set the trend for chinese women in the future ms cai said it 
remains an exception 
more widespread she said is the problem of employers refusing 
to hire women or laying off those who are pregnant or have small 
children the employers argue they cant afford maternity benefits 
usually about 70 percent of wages and that women with children tend 
to miss work more often and are more tired 
the allchina federation of trade unions recently cited a survey 
showing only about 5 percent of company heads favored hiring women 
a recent official report said 13000 women in the northeastern 
province of liaoning lost their jobs in 1987 because they were 
pregnant or had just given birth 
having children is necessary for society and we think society 
should be responsible ms cai said 
she supports experiments in several cities that seek to ease the 
burden on individual enterprises by having government and companies 
set up a collective fund to pay maternity benefits 
most women would need maternity leave only once because china 
trying to control its population attempts to limit each couple to 
one child 
resistance to the traditionalist revival is strongest among 
young educated women 
after i marry i will still struggle to achieve my goals 
said liu guanghong 23 one of daqiuzhuangs working women she is 
in charge of the administrative office of one of daqiuzhuangs 
corporations and said her goal is to become company head 
i am a woman of the 80s said ms liu my mother is 
satisfied being a good wife and mother but i want to pursue a 
career and improve myself 
however even expressing ambitions is difficult for many chinese 
women 
apart from the sex discrimination by society sex 
discrimination also exists in the thinking of women in their sense 
of inferiority ms cai said 
the key to change she said is education but it will take a 
long time maybe decades

lobby which wants to substitute public financing for individual and 
special interest money in the quarterbilliondollar plus business 
of winning seats in congress 
its going all the way to the top says fred wertheimer 
common cause president theres a different dynamic now an awful 
lot of republicans are upset with the present system and talking 
about need for change theres an unusual opportunity for 1989 
joining in the push are some people common cause wants to send to 
the election sidelines for example bill baer a senior 
partnerlobbyist in arnold amp porter one of washingtons big league 
law firms 
things have gotten out of hand says baer who heads the 
150member lobbyists and lawyers for campaign finance reform 
baer says there is deep and growing dissatisfaction over the 
seemingly endless congressional fundraising events sometimes as 
many as 10 in one night at which lobbyists fete candidates with 
2000 contributions from political action committees operated by 
industry labor and ideological groups 
the final tabulations for the 19878 election cycle havent been 
made by the federal election commission but the fec says that 
through last sept 30 pac money continued to grow both in total 
dollars and in comparison to campaign contributions from individuals 
for the period pacs pumped 357 million into all senate 
campaigns up 17 percent over the corresponding 21 months of the 
19856 cycle they provided more than onefifth of the 1598 
million given to senate candidates 
pacs provided one of every three dollars given to house 
candidates or about 737 million of the 2144 million 
contributed the pac money was nearly 24 percent higher than in the 
first 21 months of the 19856 cycle 
as in past years incumbents fared better than their challengers 
in the scramble for pac dollars senators got 517 for every 1 
contributed to challengers in the house it was 10 to one in favor 
of incumbents 
when the votes were counted all but six of the 411 house members 
seeking reelection received another term 
under consideration are spending limits that would slow or halt 
the rapidly rising cost of campaigns provisions could be included 
involving phonebank support that labor gives far more readily to 
democrats and lawmakers are puzzling over what to do about huge 
sums in littlecontrolled and unreported collected by the national 
parties 
republicans have opposed altering the system for more than a 
decade thinking that they benefit more from the status quo but 
democrats are getting more pac money their fundraising among 
individuals is catching up with that of the the gop 
the democratic party already has pulled even in the socalled 
soft money race to put the bite on corporations and people who 
can afford a 100000 contribution not covered by fec limits and 
labor continues to favor democrats 
although wertheimer is optimistic about action in the 101st 
congress he sees a tough battle because individuals who benefit 
from the current system incumbents will be writing the new rules 
aides say house leaders want to negotiate a bipartisan bill but 
house whip tony coelho dcalif is warning that if necessary 
democrats will use their majority to pass their own package 
the senate is a different matter if they keep their ranks 
together as they did in the last congress the 45 republicans can 
again prevent a vote on campaign legislation they think favors 
democrats 
we can have a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill or well 
have no bill says sen mitch mcconnell rky senate gop 
spokesman on the issue we can stop it in the senate or we can 
stop it in the white house 
mcconnell says that theres no middle ground on spending 
limits this puts him in direct conflict with democrat boren who 
last year cosponsored a package calling for voluntary spending 
limits for senate races 
even with this apparent basic difference boren says he sees some 
unspecified bargaining room with mcconnell and the republicans

the ambiguity of emperor hirohitos place in history 
rests with a key decision made in 1945 by gen douglas macarthur 
who told washington he would need a million reinforcements to occupy 
japan if hirohito were prosecuted for war crimes 
macarthur also said hirohito did not deserve to be prosecuted 
but many people then thought the opposite even as hirohito lay on 
his deathbed 43 years later there were some who said he was a war 
criminal 
the debate seems likely to continue as long as the war is 
remembered 
at the end of world war ii the allies prosecuted nazi and 
japanese war criminals seven japanese government officials 
including the prime minister gen hideki tojo were hanged after 
being found guilty in the main tokyo war crimes trial 
macarthur head of the forces occupying japan wrote in his 
memoirs reminiscences that he fended off pressure from britain 
and the soviet union to indict hirohito indeed the initial list 
of those proposed by them was headed by the emperors name he 
wrote 
but the general had decided the emperor could play a major role 
in changing japan from a militaristic nation to a peaceful member of 
the world community 
also macarthur had told washington a guerrilla war could break 
out if the emperor were indicted 
when washington seemed to be veering toward the british point 
of view i had advised that i would need at least one million 
reinforcements should such action be taken macarthur wrote 
he hadnt told the nervously waiting japanese of his decision 
and when the 44yearold emperor called on macarthur the general 
believed hirohito might plead for mercy 
instead macarthur said hirohito his hands trembling declared 
i come to you gen macarthur to offer myself to the judgment of 
the powers you represent as the one to bear sole responsibility for 
every political and military decision made and action taken by my 
people in the conduct of the war 
hirohito accepted a likely death sentence by assuming a 
responsibility clearly belied by facts of which i was fully aware 
macarthur wrote 
this provided major evidence of the view held by most historians 
today that hirohito had been a powerless figurehead but had 
approved orders that led to the attack on pearl harbor and put most 
of east asia under an often brutal japanese rule 
the main piece of contrary evidence is that hirohito was the one 
who decided to end the war if he had that power and if he thought 
the war was wrong why didnt he prevent it 
hirohito was asked at news conferences later to explain but he 
gave evasive answers he said he wouldnt criticize those who had 
ruled japan and felt obliged as a constitutional monarch to approve 
all government decisions 
as to having power to end the war he said the government had 
told him to decide what to do so again it was the governments 
responsibility 
analysts of the war crimes trial say a key episode involving gen 
tojo threatened to bring hirohito back into the picture 
tojo testified there is no japanese subject who would go 
against the will of his majesty more particularly among high 
officials of the japanese government 
since the american prosecutors had decided to keep hirohito out 
of the trial they were alarmed at the implication the emperor might 
bear responsibility 
so a week later the exprime minister was led again into the 
same territory but this time he had been briefed to give a 
different impression american author richard h minear wrote in his 
1971 book victors justice 
tojo was asked if it was hirohitos will to institute war he 
replied it might have been against his will but it is a fact 
that because of my advice and because of advice given by the high 
command the emperor consented though reluctantly to the war 
according to minears book 
minear comments the decision to exclude the emperor was a 
political decision not a decision based on the facts of the case 
under the concept of conspiracy invoked by the prosecution it would 
have been easy to assure the conviction of the emperor on all counts 
of the indictment 
the prosecutors position was that the militarists had deluded 
the japanese into thinking the emperor was with them in going to war 
macarthur summed up his view of the emperor i found he had a 
more thorough grasp of the democratic concept than almost any 
japanese with whom i talked he played a major role in the spiritual 
regeneration of japan and his loyal cooperation and influence had 
much to do with the success of the occupation

currently most incidents occur in natal where inkatha and the 
united democratic front are fighting for control of segregated black 
townships

sabotage campaign of the outlawed african national congress he 
disagrees with front policies supporting boycotts sanctions and 
strikes to end the apartheid policy of legal race separation

at a another group killing one man in mpumalanga township where a 
house was damaged by a gasoline bomb

radical palestinians in the occupied territories 
have formed a coalition of moslem fundamentalists and prosyrian 
factions opposed to plo chief yasser arafats recent peace overtures 
the radical alliance on friday issued a leaflet accusing arafat 
of selling out the cause when he recognized israel and renounced 
terrorism 
arab hospital officials said today that a palestinian village 
leader in the occupied lands was stabbed to death friday by 
unidentified assailants 
elsewhere israeli troops today shot and wounded 10 palestinians 
who attacked them with rocks an arab reporter said 
hospital officials said one of the wounded was a 16yearold girl 
who was in critical condition after being shot in the head in the 
west bank city of nablus three other west bank arabs were shot and 
wounded while six were wounded in the southern gaza strip arab 
reports and hospital officials said on condition of anonymity the 
military said it was checking the reports 
mahmoud abdallah hamoudah the 57yearold mukhtar or traditional 
leader of the west bank village of qubeiba died friday of multiple 
stab wounds said a ramallah hospital official 
israel radio said hamoudah was killed by a palestinian mob that 
attacked him at his home because he was suspected of working for 
israeli security forces 
his two sons nasser mahmoud 22 and walid 29 were slightly 
wounded in the attack said the hospital official they were treated 
for head wounds and discharged a military spokesman refused to 
comment on the incident 
qubeiba is seven miles northwest of jerusalem 
palestinians have killed more than a dozen suspected palestinian 
collaborators since the antiisraeli revolt started 13 months ago 
they are among at least 347 arabs and 14 israelis who have died in 
the uprising 
last week death threats against bethlehem mayor elias freij were 
scrawled on walls in the town after he proposed a truce in the 
palestinian uprising also last week a 25yearold suspected 
collaborator was killed in jericho 
reports in palestinian newspapers say prosyrian groups want to 
install more radical leaders 
in the occupied gaza strip four refugee camps were under curfew 
today said an army spokesman who demanded anonymity 
the united national front in occupied palestine as the radical 
new coalition calls itself said in its leaflet we demand the 
establishment of a militant leadership to replace the diminishing 
leadership of yasser arafat 
the new faction includes members of ahmed jibrils popular front 
for the liberation of palestinegeneral command and abu moussas 
breakaway faction of arafats mainstream fatah group 
there can be no reconciliation with the israeli killers and no 
negotiations with zionist criminals the document said we 
oppose any kind of political settlement whatever its source and 
consider negotiation with the enemy to be grave treason and an 
unforgivable crime 
it called for a new palestine national council to be led by 
advocates of armed struggle the palestine national council in 
november implicitly recognized israel in a declaration of an 
independent palestinian homeland 
israeli officials did not accept the implicit recognition and 
maintain the palestine liberation organization still is dedicated to 
destroying israel 
prosyrian palestinians said the new palestinian alliance 
resulted from increased collaboration between extremist factions 
over the past few months 
the plo has been moving from one mistake to another we totally 
reject the plos political compromises said sufian khatib a 
jerusalem physician opposed to arafat

secretary of state george p shultz today urged the 
leaders of more than 140 countries to foreswear using chemical 
weapons and to keep them out of the hands of terrorists 
addressing the first session of an international conference on 
chemical weapons shultz proposed the imposition of unspecified 
penalties by the united nations to those violating the 1925 geneva 
protocol banning the use of one of humanitys most dreaded and 
dreadful forms of warfare 
shultz warned that the threat of terrorists using chemical 
weapons is a real one and said some governments linked to 
terrorism have the ability to produce deadly chemical agents 
there are no insurmountable technical obstacles that would 
prevent terrorist groups from using chemical weapons shultz told 
the conference delegates 
shultz did not specify any particular country but it appeared 
libya was at least one of his targets when he said some 
governments which have been known to sponsor terrorism now have 
sizable chemical weapons capabilities 
libya is among the countries on the state departments list of 
nations sponsoring terrorism syria is also on the list and some 
analysts fear the country also may have embarked on a chemicals 
weapon program 
with the inhibitions against employing such weapons now 
weakened through recent years and with targets for conventional 
terrorist attacks becoming better protected terrorist groups could 
be tempted to shift without warning to use of chemical weapons for 
dramatic political and media attention he said 
shultz also supported increasing in the un secretarygenerals 
authority to investigate allegations into the use of chemical arms 
in war and said nations must find ways to block the transfer of 
technology 
he made no direct reference to libya nor did he single out any 
other nation believed to possess or have the ability to produce 
chemical weapons only the united states and the soviet union 
acknowledge having such stockpiles 
us officials maintain chemical weapons are being developed at a 
plant 60 miles from the libyan capital libya denies it 
however the us secretary of state said chemical weapons have 
proliferated in recent years he cited reports of the use of 
chemical arms in the middle east southeast asia and afghanistan 
we cannot delay time is not on our side he said 
technology is not stagnant ever more lethal and insidious 
chemical weapons are being developed the ability to produce such 
weapons is rapidly spreading and with it the technology to produce 
ballistic missiles as delivery vehicles 
shultz said it was grimly ironic that the threat of chemical 
weapons has grown just as progress is being made in controlling and 
reducing nuclear arms 
a nightmare for all of course would be the combination of 
ballistic missiles chemical warheads and biological weapons in the 
hands of governments with histories of the conduct of terrorist 
violence 
in opening the fiveday conference today president francois 
mitterrand of france told delegates this conference is not going 
to be a court of justice however you should state unconditionally 
and unreservedly your condemnation of chemical arms 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar asked for a minute 
of silence to honor emperor hirohito of japan who died today more 
than 140 nations were represented including 80 by their foreign 
ministers at the meeting at the headquarters of the un 
education scientific and cultural organization 
the conference is aimed at reaffirming the 1925 geneva protocol 
banning use of chemical arms and pressing for a broader agreement 
that would prohibit their use production and stockpiling 
the emnity between the united states and libya loomed over the 
conference as the united states pressed its accusations about 
libyan chemical weapons capabilities trying to persuade 
industrialized nations the claims are correct 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said friday that 
the us downing of two libyan jetfighters poisoned the 
atmosphere of the meeting 
us officials say two us planes shot down two libyan planes 
over the mediterranean in selfdefense wednesday the officials also 
say the issue of a libyan chemical plant on the verge of production 
had nothing to do with the air incident 
libya claims its chemical plant in rabta 60 miles southwest of 
tripoli is for making pharmaceuticals 
shultz and foreign minister hans dietrich genscher of west 
germany agreed today that us and west german experts would meet 
next week in washington to weigh any evidence west german firms are 
involved in the factory in rabta 
we will do everything in our power to prevent german nationals 
and german companies from taking part in chemical weapons 
production genscher said 
some published reports have linked a west german firm to the 
libyan plant but the bonn government has expressed skepticism 
for nearly two decades negotiators in geneva have worked without 
success to draft a new wider convention to give it some power of 
enforcement the meeting in paris is meant to give a political push 
to the negotiations 
perez de cuellar told the delegates the time has come to take 
concerted political action at a high level 
mitterrand said the conference should also examine the question 
of how to control and verify any future chemical weapons accord 
the conference was formally proposed by president reagan 
mitterrand had said earlier he was looking for such an initiative 
french officials stress that the final communique to be issued 
wednesday is political in nature and that binding agreements must 
come from geneva where delegates from 40 nations are at work 
according to us estimates about 20 nations have or are capable 
of producing chemical arms

presidentelect bush will keep the sideline 
seat he has occupied for the past eight years when president reagan 
sends his final budget to congress but this time all eyes will be 
on bush because the next moves clearly will be his to make 
the vice president who repeatedly touted a vague flexible 
freeze to pare the federal deficit during his campaign has been 
equally mum about details during the transition period 
but with the formal submission of reagans 115 trillion 
spending plan out of the way monday attention will shift quickly to 
bush 
theres no question his first test of leadership will be on 
this issue rep leon e panetta dcalif chairman of the house 
budget committee said in an interview 
if bush carries through on his vow and produces a credible 
spending plan that holds the increase in overall spending to the 
rate of inflation then i think that could very well be the basis 
for negotiation and for compromise with the congress panetta 
continued 
if on the other hand he walks away from that challenge in 
some way then obviously we are facing a potential for 
confrontation 
bush has said he will outline his budget priorities in an address 
to a joint session of congress soon after he takes office following 
reagans 1981 example he has indicated he wont submit a complete 
new budget but will spell out what hell add here and take off 
there 
the amendments which have yet to take shape will embody bushs 
key priorities and reiterate his oftstated pledge not to raise 
taxes transition officials said 
clearly many of reagans pet budget projects selling off a 
host of federal assets wholesale abolition of programs and agencies 
and the privatization of federal functions arent high on 
bushs list of priorities based on his campaign statements 
and he will have to make room in his budget outline for the 
kinder gentler nation proposals he talked about so much before 
the election including 22 billion in childcare tax incentives 
600 million in additional promised funds for education and 
increasing spending for environmental cleanup 
but basically reagan at least has given bush a spending outline 
that generally conforms with the vice presidents flexible 
freeze goal without advocating new taxes 
reagans budget is expected to envision a federal fiscal 1990 
deficit of 925 billion lower than the 100 billion target of the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law and a sharp decline from the 155 
billion projected in the current fiscal year 
and reagans expected call for 115 billion in overall spending 
represents a 45 percent increase over this years anticipated 110 
billion spending level thats close to the estimated 44 percent 
annual rate of inflation the consumer price index posted for 1988 
in other words the reagan budget in numbers alone adds up to the 
bush flexible freeze 
while bush and his lieutenants have maintained a low profile in 
the preparation of the reagan budget his choice for budget 
director richard g darman has made frequent trips to capitol hill 
to meet with republican budget writers 
in the meetings darman indicated the forthcoming bush proposals 
would be general and that the incoming president would put greater 
emphasis on negotiations with congress according to participants 
the bush amendments are more likely to reflect overall targets 
for major programs rather than a programbyprogram list of specific 
increases and offsetting cuts the congressional sources said 
darman all along has advocated a series of quiet negotiations 
with congress to forge a budget consensus and bush has said he 
would send his budget negotiating team headed by darman to meet 
with congressional leaders at the outset of his presidency 
however both democratic and republican leaders said bush would 
have to do more than just negotiate he would have to come up with 
his own set of proposals to have negotiating credibility 
bush has promoted some new programs that the president of the 
united states has not said new mexico sen pete v domenici the 
senior republican on the senate budget committee i dont think 
bush has been a part of this reagan budget he has to do his own 
produce his own changes 
darman so far has been laying low said mike johnson an aide 
to house republican leader robert michel of illinois i dont 
think theyre prepared at this point to begin specific discussions 
on the hill theyll wait until after bush is inaugurated to do 
that 
still darman has been kept closely informed on details of the 
preparation of the final reagan budget and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady a close bush confidant whom the vice president has 
announced he will retain played a role in shaping it 
in fact brady will be one of the administrations principal 
briefers on the document after its release monday 
outgoing budget director joseph wright suggested the reagan 
budget would be a good starting point for bush this is a very 
good thing for ronald reagan to propose as he is going out and then 
george bush can go in there and negotiate wright said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater who will occupy the same 
post in the bush presidency has said the two men differ somewhat in 
specifics but they are in general agreement about budget policy 
but he emphasized the spending plan is a reagan 
administration budget and not a bush administration budget 
bush echoed that sentiment lets see what the president does 
and then when the ball is in my court and the buck is stopping at my 
desk i may have something else to say about matters of this 
nature

the prosecutions request to drop the most 
sweeping and controversial irancontra charges against oliver l 
north could make it easier to put the former presidential aide on 
trial legal experts say 
the most politically explosive charges alleging a conspiracy to 
divert to nicaraguan rebels 14 million in proceeds from usiran 
arms sales will be gone if the dismissal move by independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh succeeds 
but some experts say that would leave a lean and mean case 
against north free of problems that have bogged down the 
proceedings for months 
district judge gerhard a gesell will decide whether to grant the 
dismissal motion if he does prosecutors will still be able to try 
the former national security council aide on 12 felony charges 
including allegations that he shredded documents and lied both to 
congress and a presidential inquiry in an effort to conceal his 
involvement in the irancontra affair 
the sex appeal part of this case is always the conspiracy 
said washington attorney stanley brand but there is still a 
substantial case left 
lying to congress and obstruction of justice are not small 
matters if in fact thats what happened said brand a former 
counsel to the house of representatives 
lying to the congress may be worse than actually diverting 
armssale proceeds to help the contras at a time lawmakers had 
banned such assistance to the rebels brand said 
the publics perception of this and what it says about the 
distribution of powers among the branches of government is as 
important to me as whether anybody goes to jail he added 
the remaining counts carry prison terms totaling 60 years they 
include charges that north lied to congress in 1985 and 1986 about 
his involvement in the covert contra resupply operation 
north also is accused of accepting installation of a 13800 
security fence around his suburban virginia home pocketing at least 
4300 in travelers checks from contra leader adolfo calero and 
illegally using a taxexempt foundation to raise money for the 
rebels 
other counts charge that north lied to attorney general edwin 
meese iii and destroyed official documents during the nov 2023 
1986 presidential investigation of the irancontra affair 
since the indictment was returned march 16 a number of federal 
prosecutors have privately criticized walsh for bringing a broad 
conspiracy charge against north and his three codefendants 
these prosecutors questioned the wisdom of trying to criminalize 
the conduct of north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
but many of these same prosecutors also supported the decision to 
charge north with destroying documents and lying to meese 
the justice department last fall filed a brief criticizing a 
legal theory walsh used to support the conspiracy charge saying it 
would set a dangerous precedent for prosecuting government officials 
whose conduct had not actually violated any laws 
brand rejected this criticism of walshs use of the conspiracy 
statute a popular law among federal prosecutors in other cases 
it was fine with those guys to use it against politicians when 
they thought it was in their interest he said 
walsh successfully defended the legality of the charges he 
brought against north gesell refused to dismiss all but two of the 
16 original charges 
from the start however there was a problem about the conspiracy 
and theft charges 
norths defense against the charges that he thought he was 
acting with president reagans permission hinged in part on highly 
secret information about covert operations 
gesell meanwhile stuck to his ruling that the prosecution must 
disclose more information than the reagan administration wanted 
released in open court 
that prompted walsh on thursday to seek dismissal of the key 
charges a motion in all likelihood gesell will grant at a hearing 
monday 
walshs decision prompted charges that the reagan administration 
deliberately held back releasing some secrets to help scuttle the 
major charges against north 
but attorney general richard thornburgh defended the 
administration noting that when walsh informed him of the decision 
the independent counsel did not complain that the intelligence 
agencies had treated him unfairly 
reagan himself said walshs decision satisfies our problem 
which has been concern about national security 
norths lawyer brendan v sullivan jr said in a statement that 
although the heart of its case is destroyed the independent 
counsel continues to toy with col north 
sullivan vowed to continue to press the secrecy issue on the 
remaining charges stating that walsh apparently refuses to 
recognize that classified information pervades the remaining charges 
as well 
but laurence tribe a harvard university law professor who has 
done some work for walshs office said the secrecy problems will be 
radically reduced once the conspiracy and theft charges are 
dismissed 
walsh will have a lean and mean version of the prosecution 
tribe said with must of the most dramatic conspiracy and theft 
elements removed walsh can proceed without the cloud of national 
security hanging over the case

in his 10 years as leader of the nations 
capital marion barry has earned the sobriquet mayor for life 
and a reputation for withstanding embarrassment and scandal that 
would wither any other politician 
in the past two weeks though there have been indications his 
industrialstrength coating of political teflon may be wearing thin 
the latest episode to ensnarl barry has triggered a federal grand 
jury investigation and raised new allegations of drug use 
corruption consorting with criminals and interference with a 
criminal investigation 
its worse than the other scrapes he has gotten into said 
bishop edward h moore leader of 125 storefront independent 
predominantly black churches across the city 
the grassroots thats been behind the mayor hes losing 
them moore said and hell lose them as he goes along 
barrys latest problems began three days before christmas when 
district of columbia police detectives went to investigate a 
suspected drug dealer at a hotel bordering a seedy area they 
encountered one of the mayors security guards barry was in the 
room of the suspect 
police left without talking to the man charles lewis he checked 
out he next day a search of the room later turned up traces of 
cocaine but barry denied any drug use and authorities said there 
was no way to determine how recently cocaine had been in the room 
from there the story reported in daily detail by the washington 
post and other local news outlets has taken a variety of twists 
none of them good for barry 
police said they were investigating a complaint by a hotel maid 
that the man barry visited had offered her drugs in exchange for sex 
the newspaper reported the police were called back from their 
investigation of lewis after confronting barrys security agent 
barry acknowledged he made several calls to the assistant police 
chief isaac fulwood and others but denied trying to interfere or 
pressure the investigation 
barry gave conflicting accounts of why he was there and of how 
many times he had visited the man 
and lewis who dropped from sight for several days before 
resurfacing in the virgin islands had a long history of contact 
with barry a native of the virgin islands he had headed an 
agreement between the islands government and the dc government 
for washington officials to provide consulting help on personnel 
matters but he was fired amid concern about free spending by 
visiting dc government officials who stayed in expensive resort 
hotels in the islands barry himself made at least one trip there in 
connection with the project 
auditors for the interior department which oversees us 
territories including the virgin islands were already investigating 
that arrangement inspector general james richards said they found 
little documentation of expenses and no trace of even a contract 
there were more damaging details but barry angrily blamed the 
post and others in the media in his first public statements he 
later apologized for the lewis episode and said im guilty of 
poor judgment no question 
as only the second elected mayor since rule over washington 
dc was released by congress 15 years ago barry has been a 
powerful symbol for many of the residents of the city that is 70 
percent black he grew to represent both the aspirations of the 
citys downtrodden and the success of its black elite 
barry who is black emerged from the civil rights movement of 
the 1960s where he was a leader of the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee or sncc 
a toughtalking figure of the streets who favored wearing 
colorful african dashikis barry slowly earned respect from and drew 
closer to the political mainstream through neighborhood work and 
service on first the school board and later the city council by the 
time he ran for mayor in 1978 he had attracted support from the 
white establishment 
he won reelection twice with twothirds or more of the vote 
leading to the conclusion the job was his for as long as he wanted 
but along the way barry raised plenty of eyebrows with reports of 
womanizing and innuendo of possible drug use 
a dozen city officials have been convicted on corruption charges 
under his administration including two deputy mayors one of them 
ivanhoe donaldson was barrys closest friend and political alter 
ego 
barry himself was the object of a highly publicized investigation 
by the us attorneys office that ended in 1987 there were 
allegations that close friends of barry paid hush money to a 
convicted cocaine dealer karen johnson 
barry who is married acknowledged a personal relationship with 
the woman but denied buying or using drugs she served a prison 
term on contempt of court charges for refusing to testify about 
barry to a grand jury later a washington magazine published what it 
said was her diary naming barry and grading his sexual performance 
barry has survived embarrassments involving other women and his 
frequent absenses from the city 
his problems this time seem most serious in part because of the 
issue of drugs and the heightened concern over that issue 
barry has been leading a public crusade against drug use in a 
city where openair drug markets operate some in close view of the 
capitol dome violence has accompanied the explosion in drugs and 
homicides came at a rate of more than one a day in 1988 
by the account of city hall insiders support for barry is 
eroding even among his own appointed officials 
one longtime ally speaking on condition he not be identified by 
name pointed to pictures of barry on his own office wall and said 
sadly this was taken three years ago but hes aged 10 years 
since then he really seems like hes on a selfdestructive course 
a washington television station wrc conducted a poll last week 
of 400 dc residents and reported nearly half thought he should 
resign 40 percent thought he was involved with drugs 
some of his support may have eroded said city council member 
john wilson who is black i think a lot of people are waiting to 
see what the us attorney and others are coming up with in this 
situation youve got to realize weve been through this three or 
four times before each time theyve not come up with anything to 
indict the mayor or force him from office 
barrys term expires in 1990 and he has not yet indicated 
whether he will run for reelection

from the muddy trenches of world war i to the lofty 
chambers of unesco today the subject of chemical warfare has long 
been of concern to france 
french troops were among the first victims of the deadly yellow 
chlorine gas released by the germans at ypres belgium on april 22 
1915 an estimated 5000 men died and 15000 others were 
incapacitated in what is considered the beginning of 20thcentury 
chemical war 
about a month later 6000 more men in the trenches suffocated 
from inhaling phosgene gas used by the germans on the russian front 
by the end of world war i chlorine phosgene and mustard gas had 
been established as chemical weapons 
public revulsion at their use brought about the international 
agreement in 1925 banning the use of chemical and bacteriological 
agents 
france which acknowledges it has the capability of making 
chemical weapons but has never admitted possessing them is 
custodian of the 1925 geneva protocol holding the original document 
in the foreign ministry and accepting additional signatories to it 
over the years 
successive governments have made much of the moral responsiblity 
implied in serving as custodian and the feeling was the backdrop 
against which president francois mitterrand proposed france play 
host to the international conference on chemical weapons that began 
saturday 
not everyone however saw france as the best choice for the 
fiveday conference 
the englishlanguage tehran times said saturday that paris was 
the least qualified to host the meeting because of its estimated 
5 billion worth of arms sales to iraq during the eightyear persian 
gulf war 
in view of frances indirect condonement of the iraqi regimes 
actions during the war and in view of the fact that iraq is one 
country which flagrantly used chemical weapons any western 
capital would have been a better and happier choice the newspaper 
said 
both iran and iraq have accused the other of using poison gas it 
is known that iraq used mustard gas during the war both are 
signatories to the protocol

boat people fleeing poverty in the 
dominican republic are boarding flimsy motor boats and braving a 
hazardous 90mile stretch of the caribbean to reach puerto rico 
gateway to the united states 
many of the illegal aliens drown during the threeday voyage 
most who make it ashore later pose as puerto ricans to slip past 
immigration officials and board flights to new york 
us coast guard and border patrol officials in puerto rico say 
they dont have enough manpower to halt the exodus which has 
increased sharply in recent months as the dominican economy worsens 
the dominican republic has a population of 6 million and as many 
as 30000 try to leave each year officials estimate they say no 
more than 10 percent to 20 percent of dominicans illegally entering 
puerto rico are caught some 3000 people were detained in 1988 the 
rest either make it or drown 
authorities complain that the problem isnt getting the attention 
it deserves because its happening so far from the us mainland 
puerto rico a us commonwealth is 1000 miles southeast of miami 
there are human beings dying and they also pose an economic 
threat to the united states but the consciousness of this is 
zero said capt william a caster head of the coast guards 
greater antilles command 
us officials say the dominican exodus has reached the scale of 
haitis in 1985 when thousands of boat people were intercepted by 
the coast guard and hundreds of others washed up on floridas shores 
the only difference is that haitians were dying off the us 
coast said caster who also led the haitian operation 
another difference is that the coast guard has an agreement with 
haiti allowing the coast guard to board haitian boats to check for 
illegal aliens the agreement resulted in the arrest of some 4000 
haitians in 1988 
there is no such accord with the dominican government although 
talks are to start in the new year about signing one 
we are focusing on the drug problem not aliens said caster 
we dont go out looking for dominicans were coming across them 
on our patrols and when we do it invariably turns out to be a 
rescue operation 
the boats are in such bad shape and the people are in so much 
danger they are thankful to be taken anywhere he said 
facing 30 percent unemployment rate and 60 percent inflation 
dominicans are lured to the united states in search of jobs and to 
puerto rico because spanish is spoken here and puerto ricans are 
us citizens a dominican who can pass for a puerto rican doesnt 
need documents or a passport to fly to new york where most illegal 
dominicans end up 
authorities concede it is easy for dominicans to get past 
immigration officials at san juans airport with a wellrehearsed 
new york when asked where theyre from 
there arent that many differences between the languages and 
cultures of the dominican republic and puerto rico said james 
walker the district director of the immigration and naturalization 
service he said more than 1 million dominicans are in the united 
states most of them illegally 
if the family never hears from them they assume they made it 
safely they dont think anybody drowned said walker 
about 100 bodies were recovered in a twomonth period alone in 
1988 
but we never find the bodies when they drown in the high seas 
we suspect theres quite a number though said joe b bennett 
chief of the border patrol the federal agency set up a year ago in 
the northwest port of aguadilla where most dominicans arrive 
dominicans take on the 90mile mona passage in fragile wooden 
fishing boats loaded with up to 80 people they usually wear no life 
jackets or other safety equipment 
they dont know the first thing about navigating in the most 
hazardous conditions in one of the most dangerous waters of the 
world said bennett 
clashing winds from the caribbean and the atlantic can whip up 
20foot swells in the mona passage its a trip even the coast guard 
and border patrol avoid on rough days 
dominicans sell stoves and refigerators to raise the 500 
smugglers charge for the journey the price is 3000 if a plane 
ticket to new york is included 
ramon antonio sanches a 30yearold fisherman recently arrested 
off the cost of aguadilla said he sold everything he had for the 
trip 
if hunger is going to kill me i prefer to be killed 
escaping he said what i want to do is work but there are no 
jobs at home 
the coast guard patrols 13 million square miles with seven large 
patrol boats four smaller boats four helicopters and three planes 
the border patrol has 17 agents and two boats for a 30mile 
coastline bennett said it would take 200 agents to halt the exodus

shell oil co officials said a pipeline rupture 
that sent 840000 gallons of oil into the gasconade river last month 
may have been caused by a malfunction at an illinois refinery that 
temporarily increased pressure in the line 
shell spokesman tony canino said friday that pressure increased 
in the pipeline laid in 1948 while valves at a refinery in wood 
river ill 170 miles east of the spill site in central missouri 
were switching some crude oil from the shell pipeline into another 
line operated by marathon oil co 
canino said company officials have not determined what caused the 
malfunction 
the oil from the spill one of the worst inland spills in us 
history made its way from the gasconade to the missouri river and 
from there to the mississippi 
meanwhile a spokeswoman for the us department of 
transportation said a federal inspector visited the spill site last 
week to determine if shell violated any regulations in its operation 
of the 435mile pipeline which runs from cushing okla to 
roxanna ill 
the oil lost in the shell spill is more than three times larger 
than the amount lost in all pipeline accidents in 1987 the last 
year for which figures are available said the spokeswoman suzette 
paes 
the oil erupted from a 35foot rupture in a buried pipeline near 
the gasconade river about 140 miles west of st louis 
also friday anheuser busch cos announced that it had recalled 
1500 of 2000 bottlers and brewers laid off tuesday when production 
shut down after tasters noticed an oily aroma to the water used for 
brewing the beer water samples taken wednesday by the state 
department of natural resources turned up no traces of oil or 
related chemicals 
in a statement andrew j steinhubl senior vice president of 
brewing said the company would return gradually to full 
production and full employment 
st louis water department officials have said that while the 
water from city taps might taste and smell oily for a few days 
there was no danger extra steps were taken in treating water taken 
from the missouri and mississippi as the oil spill moved past the 
city

in a short silent ceremony soon after the death of 
his father emperor akihito on saturday ascended the chrysanthemum 
throne and received the mythic symbols of imperial legitimacy a 
sword and jewels 
the ancient ceremony began when the new emperor clad in black 
morning coat and gray trousers and accompanied by six male members 
of the imperial family entered the matsu no ma hall of the imperial 
palace 
for the first time reporters were allowed to witness the somber 
ritual which later was broadcast on national television 
journalists were led through dimly lit concrete tunnels to the 
palace where they watched through tinted windows that hid them from 
those at the ceremony 
it lasted just four minutes 
taking his place before a purple and gold folding screen and 
highbacked wooden chair bearing the imperial chrysanthemum crest 
akihito stood facing the official witnesses prime minister noboru 
takeshita 19 cabinet ministers the four heads of parliament and 
two supreme court judges 
the government leaders later were joined by top imperial 
household agency officials and chamberlains all wore morning coats 
and black ties 
with bows three palace officials presented the seals and two 
encased objects of the regalia a sword and jewels then placed 
them on short wooden tables before the emperor the third regalia 
item a mirror is kept at a shrine on the palace grounds 
the regalia which have deep religious significance to followers 
of japans native shinto religion have never been displayed in 
public and were encased throughout the rite 
after exchanging bows with those present akihito left the room 
preceded by the sword bearer and followed by the chamberlain 
carrying the jewels the imperial and state seals carried in two 
purple pouches were removed after other members of the imperial 
family had left 
for centuries the regalia have symbolized the divine origin of 
the worlds oldest imperial family 
according to legend the mirror was used by the deities to lure 
the sun goddess amaterasu out of selfimposed seclusion on the high 
celestial plain and the jewels were given to her after she emerged 
the sword was a token of repentance by her brother who drew it 
from a giant eighttailed eightheaded snake he killed after being 
banished from the divine highland for misconduct 
amaterasu later gave the regalia to her grandson ninigi no 
mikoto before sending him to conquer the japanese islands he 
passed them on to jimmu another descendant of the sun goddess who 
by legend was japans first ruler 
today the supposed original mirror is kept at the grand shrine 
of ise the center of shinto sun goddess worship 200 miles southwest 
of tokyo the original sword is at the atsuta shrine in nagoya 
central japan and the original jewels said to be commashaped 
stones are kept at the imperial palace in tokyo 
replicas of the sword and mirror themselves ancient are used in 
imperial ascension ceremonies 
until his death saturday emperor hirohito slept in a room where 
the jewels and replica sword are stored

moammar gadhafi today called for direct 
negotiations with the united states to resolve a dispute over a 
libyan factory us officials claim was built to produce chemical 
weapons 
the libyan leader made the statement at tripolis best hotel 
where he arrived unexpectedly to speak to foreign reporters it was 
his first public appearance since two us navy jets shot down two 
libyan migs over the mediterranean sea on wednesday 
america must understand that her policy of surrounding us and 
using force against us will absolutely fail gadhafi said 
speaking softly in arabic 
they must negotiate with libya directly and they should sit at 
the negotiating table with libya without their weapons to achieve 
peace in the mediterranean he said he was ringed by bodyguards 
during his appearance in a hotel lobby lounge 
i think the bush administration will be able to do this because 
they will have learned their lessons of the previous administration 
there have been enough lessons they will have learned that force 
does not pay especially with libya gadhafi said 
we will not respond to force only to politeness and direct 
negotiations 
the united states brushed aside gadhafis call for direct 
negotiations a senior us official attending a chemical warfare 
conference in paris said communications is not the problem the 
problem is libyan policy 
but the official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity also said i am not ruling anything in or out 
secretary of state george p shultz said thursday the united 
states had been able to stay in touch with libya through 
intermediaries 
gadhafis fiveminutelong statement was translated into english 
by a libyan who works for the information ministry 
the libyan leaders curly hair was topped by a black wool 
pillbox hat he wore a maroonandblue sweater covered by a brown 
wool cape to protect him from tripolis rainy weather 
asked about the us pressures on his country gadhafi vowed 
never to bow to the americans even if this confrontation lasts 1 
million years 
the unexpected sight of a smiling gadhafi in the hotel set off 
chaos journalists and camera crews knocked over potted plants 
scrambled atop chairs and climbed over a twostoryhigh ornamental 
fountain inside the lobby 
sources in the capital said gadhafi had not been seen in public 
for several weeks and there was speculation he had fled in fear of 
a us attack 
tensions between the united states and libya have increased 
because of us allegations that libya has built a chemical weapons 
factory in rabta 60 miles from the capital 
libya has insisted the plant will manufacture medicine president 
reagan has said he could not rule out a military strike against the 
site 
in 1986 gadhafis headquarters in tripoli was bombed by the 
united states in to retaliate for libyas alleged support for 
terrorism 
gadhafi told reporters today that the administration of 
presidentelect george bush should sit with libya to discuss 
facetoface cases of dispute libya is absolutely against terrorism 
but we are beside the just struggle for just causes 
he added the palestinian peoples stuggle for a free palestine 
is a just struggle and we will never hesitate to support it 
gadhafis regime came to power in 1969 with a coup that ousted a 
westernbacked monarchy 
bush will have another lesson from the failure of americas 
childish policies which gain nothing said gadhafi 
gadhafi and other libyan officials offered the united states a 
onetime inspection of the rabta plant but the reagan 
administration rejected that offer saying libya could disguise the 
plant for the inspection and then restore its chemical weapons 
capabilities 
gadhafi told reporters today libya will participate in all 
negotiations to get rid of all weapons from ordinary guns to nuclear 
bombs america must get rid of its chemical and nuclear weapons 
factories and cancel the star wars program refering to us 
research for a spacebased defense system 
all nations of the world must agree to get rid of weapons and 
settle for peace if this does not happen we have only 
confrontation libya will never surrender and america will lose 
said gadhafi 
libya will accept the participation of any international 
committee to inspect israeli factories and factories in america 
europe and any spot of the world gadhafi concluded in his 
statement 
on friday the libyan government charged at a news conference and 
in official media that its planes were overwhelmed wednesday by 14 
hostile american aircraft 
a government spokesman maintained the us report that two navy 
jets had acted in selfdefense was a fabrication 
washington provided the us media with videotape taken by a us 
aircraft of the encounter and showed photographs to the un 
security council of what it said was a heavily armed libyan plane 
involved in the encounter

attacked costa rican president oscar arias proposal to postpone 
this months central american peace summit other leaders said they 
still plan to attend 
arias who won the nobel peace prize in 1987 for spearheading a 
regional peace plan said friday the summit planned for jan 1516 
should be postponed to give presidentelect george bush time to 
formulate his policy in the region 
the great irony is that president arias the great creator of 
the esquipulas peace plan for which he was given the nobel prize 
could be the same person that buries the plan ortega said friday 
night 
he was speaking at an awards ceremony for milos jakes visiting 
secretarygeneral of czechoslovakias communist party 
fixing the dates of jan 15 and 16 was proof by the central 
american governments that we werent going to be waiting until the 
new north american government assumed power to debate our problems 
and look for a solution he said 
arias also said he and his counterparts in honduras guatemala 
nicaragua and el salvador need more time to prepare for the meeting 
in san salvador el salvador 
the presidents had planned to talk about how to revive the peace 
plan they signed in 1987 although some progress had been made the 
plan now is stalled in all the countries it applied to 
ortega said arias proposal could practically kill previous 
peace accords between the central american nations 
honduran and guatemalan officials said they still plan to attend 
im still preparing for the meeting president jose napoleon 
duarte of el salvador told reporters 
arias hinted to a news conference that central american leaders 
may get more support for their plan from the new us administration 
president reagans administration didnt fully understand the 
plan for peace in central america arias said while the 
statements of mr baker make it appear that there is a commitment to 
give diplomatic support to resolving the conflicts in central 
america 
the united states supports nicaraguas contra rebels who are 
trying to overthrow nicaraguas leftist government it backs the 
governments of el salvador and guatemala in their conflicts with 
leftist rebels and considers costa rica and honduras strong allies 
arias peace plan called for ceasefires political amnesties and 
negotiations between guerrillas and the governments of nicaragua el 
salvador and guatemala 
a ceasefire has been in effect between the contras and the 
nicaraguan government since march 1988 and the level of fighting 
there has dropped drastically but fighting continues in guatemala 
and has escalated in el salvador

a halfdozen students in an adult 
literacy project were hesitant at first but now theyre all 
published authors 
the book of six stories fireside memories was mailed last 
week to 200 people who helped keep the hattiesburg education 
literacy project going during the past year 
the 24page book is partly a thank you to those who have 
given time and money to the literacy project but its also a way to 
get the students interested in writing said project director ron 
blackwell 
when blackwell and tom boss volunteer coordinator for the 
center first proposed to students that they write stories for 
publication the answer was no way boss said 
some of the adult students dont want to let their friends and 
coworkers know they have trouble reading boss said 
but eventually six students agreed to put their ideas in print 
some wrote their stories alone others dictated to a tutor 
tom miller who has been working with tutor kathy ballard for two 
years wrote poetically about colors of christmas with all of its 
beauty of red gold and silver and the pure white snow which stands 
for gods pure love for us all 
we talked about writing what christmas meant to him ballard 
said he came in with it and it was written it was not all in 
complete sentences but i didnt want to touch it it was free 
verse the only things i changed were some possible spellings

what would a legal document be without a few 
heretofores and forthwiths 
it probably would be better written and easier to understand 
says minerva h neiditz director of the university of connecticuts 
institute of writing who is running a contest to find the best 
legal brief written in connecticut in 1988 
for the contest 900 law firms and state agencies have been asked 
to submit their best appellate briefs filed in either state or 
federal court the deadline is jan 15 and neiditz is hoping to 
receive at least 100 entries 
lawyers have been my most difficult clients because they all 
assume they can write theyre extremely sensitive to anyone 
criticizing them nieditz said 
there is a tremendous amount of extra verbiage and pomposity 
she said so i thought it would be an exciting first project for 
the institute to create this competition for the best legal brief 
briefs will be screened initially by members of the uconn law 
review then a panel of six judges will make the final selection 
some details of the contest are still to be worked out for 
instance neiditz doesnt know how many runnersup will be named 
she doesnt know when the winners will be announced and she doesnt 
know if cash prizes will be given although shes hoping they will 
in the event of a tie neiditz will cast the deciding vote

april lasalata elizabeth croff and lydia 
grohoski all turned to the courts to ward off their estranged 
husbands but the long arm of the law was not long enough or strong 
enough to prevent their murders 
in the past two weeks all three long island women who had 
obtained court orders of protection from their estranged or former 
husbands were shot to death by those men each man then killed 
himself 
we did our damnedest to protect her mary werner chief of 
the suffolk county district attorneys family crime bureau said of 
the most recent victim mrs lasalata who was killed tuesday 
mrs werner choking back tears said we knew for about a year 
of horrendous fear that she lived with every day we tried 
everything to help her short of placing an armed 24hour guard in 
front of her house and we failed her 
it is a refrain becoming unnervingly common on long island 
mrs croff 30 of central islip was chased down and shot to 
death by her exhusband william as she clutched her 2yearold 
daughter dec 30 
she obtained a court order of protection almost a month before 
she called police on at least five occasions seeking to have him 
arrested but was told they could make an arrest only if her husband 
was there when they arrived 
on dec 26 george grohoski invaded his estranged wifes southold 
home and shot her in the face with a shotgun before killing himself 
she too had an order of protection and police had gone to the 
couples home four or five times in the past year on calls of 
domestic violence 
police pointed out that the killings all occurred during the 
holidays when family violence tends to escalate but it was 
possible police said that one shooting inspired another copycat 
style 
they also inspired hysteria organizations that aid battered 
women reported a flood of calls from women whose fears were 
aggravated by reports of the murders 
suffolk county authorities point to a yearold policy that police 
make arrests rather than encourage mediation in domestic violence 
arrests increased from 126 in 1987 to 1200 in 1988 
meg oregan suffolk county deputy attorney said of 1930 
protective orders by suffolk family court last year 275 were 
violated 
an order of protection cannot stop a psychotic killer she 
said but most husbands are not psychotic killers 
it was not the first attack on mrs lasalata anthony lasalata 
was charged with trying to kill his 34yearold exwife in february 
months after their eightyear marriage was dissolved he broke into 
her house cut her telephone lines and stabbed her with a hunting 
knife the couples son ran to a neighbor who called police 
lasalata was ordered held on 25000 bail on charges of assault 
and attempted murder despite pleas by the district attorney for a 
higher bond 
when lasalata posted bail after eight months in jail police 
installed a sophisticated alarm in mrs lasalatas home to 
automatically alert police if anyone broke in 
they also gave her a handheld electronic device to signal police 
in an emergency patrol cars carried a picture of lasalata so they 
could identify him if he appeared in her neighborhood mrs 
lasalatas mother lillian principio went to her daughters house 
every night so someone was home when mrs lasalata returned from 
work 
the protection order did not dispel mrs lasalatas fears in 
october she told authorities that her former husband drove past her 
house and stared at her the prosecutor sought higher bail judge 
rudolf mazzei refused 
mazzei refused to increase bail on another occasion when mrs 
lasalata claimed her husband had called her and breathed heavily 
into the phone 
the only reason for bail is to return a defendant to court and 
he had made all his court appearances said mazzei we dont 
have preventive detention in the united states 
weeks ago mrs lasalata made a will and chose an urn for her 
cremation she knew she was going to die said her mother 
mrs lasalata was gunned down in front of her brentwood house as 
she returned home from work tuesday on friday her husbands body 
was found with a rifle in the front seat of his car at a highway 
rest stop 
suffolk law enforcement officials have asked the state 
legislature to upgrade violations of protection orders from 
misdemeanors to felonies 
suffolk county announced that henceforth a judge would be 
available every night to issue arrest warrants that did little to 
appease mrs lasalatas mother 
the system stinks said mrs principio if it was the 
judges daughter he would not have let him out on bail 
mazzei dismissed his critics as mondaymorning quarterbacks 
this is a human tragedy he said its the kind of thing 
that can drive a judge crazy

the number of students entering us nursing 
schools rose 11 percent last year after falling nearly a third from 
1983 to 1987 according to a survey of more than 220 schools across 
the nation 
schools responding to the annual survey to be published monday 
by the trade magazine nursingworld journal had a total of 15494 
freshmen in 1988 up from 13970 a year earlier 
the magazines publisher richard a devito attributed the 
turnaround primarily to rising salaries and plentiful job 
opportunities probably the most important thing is that there has 
been so much publicity about the national shortage of nurses he 
said friday 
but a more troubling factor devito said is that many schools 
have reduced minimum entry level gradepoint averages to attract 
more applicants perhaps as a result he said graduate nurses 
failed their licensing exams at a record rate of 16 percent in 1988 
four times the level of 1987 
hospital officials hailed the surveys finding as good news for 
the nations health care system it has been strained by a 
significant and persistent shortage of nurses according to a 
december report by the commission on nursing of the us department 
of health and human services 
were going through a period where theres a wrenching change 
in need for intensive nursing because new york san francisco 
boston and other cities are faced with a pandemic of aids we need 
more nurses not less said martin h bander a spokesman for 
massachusetts general hospital 
two critically burned patients were turned away in august 1988 
from the only hospital in denver with a special burn unit because of 
a shortage of nurses and in february the largest hospital on long 
island in new york began refusing nonemergency cases because of a 
lack of nurses 
some 300000 nursing jobs were unfilled nationwide the american 
nurses association estimated last year 
and the federal bureau of labor statistics said the biggest 
demand for any single occupation between 1988 and the end of the 
century would be for registered nurses 
devito said the shortage has had a direct impact on wages 
pushing up starting salaries for registered nurses by an average of 
5000 to 6000 over the last five years registered nurses now 
typically start at 22000 to 28000 a year depending on the 
region of the country and experienced nurses earn up to 55000 in 
some cities he said 
nursingworld journal said it sent its survey to 1491 us 
nursing schools and received responses from 227 institutions in 44 
states 
according to the survey licensed practical nursing programs 
experienced the greatest increase in entering students in 1988 
reporting a 254 percent jump hospitalbased diploma programs were 
next with a 146 percent rise 
bachelors degree programs at fouryear colleges and universities 
saw a 107 percent increase the smallest change was in associate 
degree programs offered by twoyear junior colleges which reported 
87 percent more freshmen 
devito cautioned that because of the decline in entrance 
requirements the overall increase of 11 percent may not necessarily 
translate into an 11 percent rise in the number of nursing graduates 
the problem its going to create is that while we have roughly 
a big increase in freshman enrollees theyve lowered the admission 
standards so we may have fewer people who are going to be able to 
make the grade he said

state leaders are trying to make wisconsin 
less attractive to poor people considering moving there by offering 
new residents only as much in welfare as they would have received in 
their old state 
following a recent study that concluded the state was a welfare 
magnet gov tommy g thompson is proposing to limit payments for 
incoming welfare recipients for their first three or six months in 
wisconsin his aides said friday 
the republican governors plan to be included in his budget 
message to the legislature later this month was revealed a day 
after a key democrat state senate majority leader joseph strohl 
advocated a similar plan 
it is time that we democrats admit that people really are 
moving here because of our higher benefits and begin to address 
it strohl said 
but others say the twotiered benefit plan even if it applies 
only during a residents first few months in the state is 
unconstitutional 
the supreme court says its illegal to have a twotiered system 
of benefits said the rev ted steege head of the lutheran office 
of public policy in wisconsin 
steege said each state has established a standard of need for 
welfare recipients and no state can create a new class of citizens 
who arent entitled to that 
the supreme court in 1969 ruled a oneyear waiting period for aid 
to families with dependent children benefits in several states and 
the district of columbia was unconstitional because it created an 
invidious distinction among citizens 
but lawmakers here said a twotiered plan in effect giving out 
lower benefits rather than no benefits for the first few months of 
residence has never gone before the court 
strohl said he was mildly optimistic the courts would uphold 
such a plan because it does not deny all benefits based on ones 
length of residency in the state 
a recent report from the wisconsin policy research institute that 
found 29 percent of new welfare cases in wisconsin were people from 
other states 
more than onefourth of the new arrivals were from illinois 
where a family of three receives 558 a month in afdc benefits and 
food stamps a family of three received a total off 542 a month in 
indiana combined benefits for such a family in wisconsin are 680 a 
month 
steege contended welfare recipients are attracted to wisconsin 
for a variety of reasons including its quality of life lower crime 
rate good schools and to join family members who have previously 
moved there 
in november 83216 families in wisconsin received afdc compared 
with 72646 in 1980

president reagan touted his forthcoming budget 
today as a responsible plan that will cut the deficit and assure 
americas prosperity without raising taxes 
i leave as i came dead set against any new taxes reagan 
said in the nexttolast radio address of his presidency 
the fiveminute talk was taped on friday because the president 
entered walter reed army medical center for surgery today to correct 
a curvature of his left ring finger 
the presidents final spending plan is due out monday a 115 
trillion budget that is said to propose the elimination of 82 
government programs while protecting his twoterm defense buildup 
it covers the 1990 fiscal year which begins next oct 1 
but since presidentelect george bush is slated to take office on 
jan 20 reagans document has been branded in some quarters as 
irrelevant 
its a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without touching 
social security weakening defense or reducing benfits to the 
needy reagan asserted and the best news is that this budget 
proves it can be done without raising your taxes 
raising taxes would be the surest way to kill the economic 
goose that lays the golden eggs reagan said 
the president argued that his plan will contain additional funds 
for air safety fighting crime housing the poor the war on drugs 
and the space program as well as fighting acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or aids 
the president also warned that his defense buildup must be 
maintained saying it is the price of peace and security for 
america 
my fiscal year 1990 budget provides for the needy does not 
raise taxes and by controlling the growth in spending reduces the 
deficit next year by nearly 70 billion reagan said 
this budget is a realistic program which protects the working 
families of america provides adequate support for those who depend 
on government and helps assure americas prosperity for years to 
come reagan said 
the president also put in a plug for his decision this week to 
back the large pay raise for congress judges and top executive 
branch officials that has been recommended by a presidential 
commission 
we must be willing to pay for excellence in government or risk 
a government run only by people of wealth or by those beholden to 
special interests regan said 
the 50 percent pay raise will be come law automatically unless 
each house of congress rejects it by feb 8 the plan includes a ban 
on outside speaking fees and other certain income and will formally 
be sent to the congress with reagans budget on monday 
giving the democratic response to reagans radio speech was house 
speaker jim wright of texas who expressed hopes for a new era of 
cooperation and good feelings between congress and the white house 
speaking about bush wright said we in the house leadership 
are eager to help him attain his announced goal of wider access for 
all americans to education to child care to affordable housing and 
to a cleaner environment 
we in congress hope that the next administration together with 
us will usher in a new era of cooperation and good feelings between 
the legislative and executive branches of government wright said

the california raisins are in the middle of 
a mild rhubarb and the adcelebrities wont be marching in 
presidentelect george bushs inaugural parade 
the wrinkled television stars were billed last week by parade 
coordinators as prominent characters in the 78float parade 
following the swearingin on jan 20 
but the people who run the california raisin advisory board 
which bankrolls the famous corrugated crowd of tv ad fame said it 
was news to them 
the inaugural procession would include attractions from 
bellringers to bagpipes california raisins to rodeo queens 
said the announcements on parade plans 
i was surprised to read it said robert phinney the boards 
director of advertising 
phinney denied that bushs damned dancing raisins campaign 
crack had anything to do with the boards refusal to have people in 
california raisin costumes march in the parade 
for more than two years the board has promoted its product with 
the help of animated figures shaped like raisins dancing to the 
1960s song i heard it through the grapevine 
since then raisin sales shot up 11 percent and more than 300 
raisin dolls shirts and other items have gone on store shelves 
the human version of the california raisins people in black 
tights under costumes occasionally make public appearances and 
during christmastime first lady nancy reagan invited the furrowed 
fellows to help entertain children of foreign diplomats at a white 
house party but the parade presented some new wrinkles 
ed cassidy spokesman for the bush inaugural committee said the 
raisin marchers were selected by the council on physical fitness to 
accompany its float but that the raisin advisory board but the 
kibosh on the plans wed be pleased to have the california 
raisins in the parade if the board wishes them to be there he 
said 
phinney said the big hangup was the councils plan for the 
raisins to walk 2 miles in their raisin outfits alongside the 
floats such a walk said phinney would be too tough on the raisins 
our characters are known for their dancing phinney said 
the absence of the raisins might not be terribly disappointing to 
bush who will watch the parade from a reviewing stand in front of 
the white house bush has already seen the raisins 
they performed at a bush campaign rally in kingsburg important 
raisin country on the final weekend of the campaign bush joked 
that he canceled a planned return to the area because he didnt want 
to see those damned raisins again 
phinney insisted the wisecrack had nothing to do with the parade 
refusal adding that the remark certainly didnt warm the cockles 
of our heart

prosecutors say the investigation of pentagon 
corruption which took more than six months to yield its first 
indictments is just getting started 
none of the indictments issued in us district court on friday 
involves highranking present or former military officials but us 
attorney henry hudson said the continuing inquiry promises to be a 
protracted affair 
one defense contractor a navy employee and five other men were 
indicted on charges that included conspiracy and bribery while 
another corporation pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the 
government 
i think over the next few months perhaps the next year youll 
see a great deal of additional activity hudson said friday 
adding that the initial round of indictments represented a small 
percentage of the case 
its a significant investigation and my assessment of its 
dimensions hasnt changed in the last six or seven months he 
said prosecutors have subpoenaed more than 1 million documents and 
spent many many hours before the grand jury he said 
the bigrigging investigation hinges on allegations that private 
consultants hired by defense contracting firms paid bribes to 
government employees for inside information that gave them an 
advantage in securing multimilliondollar contracts 
hudson who had once promised indictments in late fall said he 
is satisfied with the pace of the complex case 
i think if youll compare this to others of its type this 
investigation is almost unprecedently quick he said 
six months ago president reagan declaring he was very upset 
about the reports of corruption in the pentagons 
150billionayear purchasing system told law enforcement agents 
to move as rapidly as possible to get the facts on the case 
said his spokesman marlin fitzwater 
and presidentelect bush said the allegations if correct showed 
people stealing from our national defense and undermining our 
national security 
although the investigation had been under way since september 
1986 it was not made public until midjune when the fbi issued 
search warrants at 38 locations and 12 states investigators used 
courtordered wiretaps to gather much of their information 
at least 20 defense contractors are under investigation as well 
as six pentagon officials and a number of consultants among them 
melvyn paisley former assistant secretary of the navy for research 
engineering and systems 
hudson has said no congressmen were targets of the investigation 
although rep roy dyson dmd and former rep william chappell 
dfla were once described as being under scrutiny no search 
warrants or subpoenas were issued to members of congress or their 
staffs 
shortly after the investigation was revealed defense secretary 
frank carlucci reassigned the six pentagon officials under scrutiny 
then based on information he received from court papers he 
suspended payment on 1 billion worth of potentially tainted 
military contracts 
the investigation has prompted calls in congress to overhaul and 
procurement system at the pentagon which lets contracts worth 620 
million daily 
the first indictment named teledyne electronics of newbury park 
calif a division of teledyne industries three of its employees 
two private consultants and a navy procurement specialist they will 
be arraigned friday in us district court teledyne could be fined 
up to 65 million if convicted 
at the heart of the indictment are charges that teledyne and its 
officers agreed to pay consultant william parkin 160000 to assist 
them in obtaining a navy contract worth 100 million 
parkin paid fred lackner a californiabased private consultant 
who gave money to stuart e berlin a navy procurement official for 
his assistance in manipulating the procurement process the 
indictment says 
if convicted of all charges berlin parkin and lackner could 
face maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of 55 
million each hudson said 
at the same time hazeltine corp of greenlawn ny a division 
of emerson electric co pleaded guilty among other things to 
conspiracy to defraud the government in its efforts to obtain a 
contract for radar testing devices 
hazeltine which is cooperating with the government agreed to 
pay fines and court costs of just under 2 million a fee hudson 
said he believed was appropriate 
two former hazeltine employees and a teledyne electonics employee 
also pleaded guilty to lesser charges they too are cooperating 
with the government 
the pentagon said it is reviewing the guilty pleas and the 
indictments to see what action should be taken

president reagans doctors surgically corrected 
a curvature of his left ring finger on saturday and he was described 
as being in good spirits after the 2hour operation 
the president is comfortable and completed the operation with 
flying colors reagans doctor col john hutton said in a 
statement released by the white house 
the operation was designed to alleviate a rather common but 
deforming condition known as dupuytrens contracture it caused the 
presidents finger to curve inward 
reagans arm will be in a sling and his hand bandaged for several 
days he he will receive no special medication other than routine 
postoperative antibiotics and analgesics the statement said 
it is anticipated that the president will have full use of his 
finger the statement added 
hutton said reagan was alert and responsive throughout the 
surgery which began at 824 am est and was sucessfully 
completed around 11 am est his overall health is excellent 
the physician said 
hes in good spirits white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said following the surgery reagan returned to his hospital room 
shortly after the procedure and was visited by his wife nancy the 
spokesman said 
todays procedure is not expected to interrupt the presidents 
normal work schedule fitzwater said 
fitzwater said reagan chatted with the team of physicians 
throughout the procedure talking about horses and his upcoming 
return to california reagan returns to his home state on jan 20 
after presidentelect george bush is inaugurated 
hutton reported that the presidents doctors began administering 
local anesthesia shortly after 730 am to numb his arm and hand 
the procedure was conducted by a team of physicians at walter reed 
army medical center 
hutton said reagans operation consisted of a partial palmer 
and digital fasciectomy the disease extended from the wrist to the 
tip of the ring finger 
fitzwater explained that reagans finger was cut from his palm to 
the tip of his finger and that the diseased tissue was removed in 
order to allow the finger to move freely 
the affliction causes the progressive and usually painless 
contraction of the fingers and is due to a thickening of the tissue 
called fascia in the palm of the hand 
dr robert j neviaser chairman of the orthopedic surgery 
department and director of the hand surgery service at george 
washington university medical center said dupuytrens contraction 
is a fairly common problem in men of irish or scottish ancestry 
reagan is a descendent of irish immigrants 
neviaser said doctors do not know exactly what causes the 
affliction which consists of a cellular activity that changes the 
fascia causing formation of bands and nodules the skin becomes 
thin over the fascia and the contraction of the fingers start 
to relieve the contraction neviaser said surgeons make an 
incision over the area in the palm where a band of tissue has 
formed the fascia is carefully separated from the skin and removed 
the incision in the skin then is stitched back together 
neviaser who is not involved in reagans operation said only 
the tissue directly involved with the finger contraction is removed 
although the procedure to remove the diseased tissue is 
considered minor surgery and patients usually do not remain 
overnight in the hospital reagan was to stay at walter reed until 
sunday as a precaution fitzwater said 
the first lady was expected to stay overnight at the white house 
but to go to the hospital to accompany her husband home 
upon entering the hospital just before noon mrs reagan nodded 
yes when asked if she had spoken with the president by 
telephone flashed a thumbsup signal and said he was fine 
the contracture was minimal when reagan took office in 1981 but 
progressed enough during the past year to require surgical treatment 
untreated the condition eventually may involve all four fingers 
but the thumb leaving the hand in a clenched clawlike position 
fitzwater said hutton did not expect any further surgery to be 
necessary 
after several days the spokesman said reagans splint will be 
removed and he will only be required to wear a hand bandage he will 
wear a socalled dynamic splint for several months it is a 
splint that allows the finger to flex so that the muscles can be 
strengthened the spokesman said 
hutton said the physicians involved besides himself included 
dr george bogumill of georgetown university and a consultant at 
walter reed col alan smith and maj paul perlik of the hand 
service at walter reed 
the anesthesiologist was lt col charles gandy lt col lawrence 
mohr of the white house medical unit and members of the department 
of medicine at walter reed took part as consultants hutton said

black and white students are in the same 
public schools for the first time in st helena parish after 
officials settled a 36yearold integration lawsuit the nations 
oldest 
the biggest problem has been kids not finding their 
classrooms said malcolm mizell one of two administrators sharing 
responsibility for the new consolidated high school after classes 
began friday 
its working smoother than anybody thought it would agreed 
willie johnson the other cosupervisor mizell was principal at 
allwhite greensburgh high school and johnson was principal at fifth 
ward elementary a predominantly black school 
although st helena parishs high school students all are going 
to class in what used to be greensburg high it will be next fall 
before their classes are integrated officials said for this 
semester they have the same classmates and teachers they had when 
the year began 
friday was the first day of class under an integration plan 
proposed by the school board and approved dec 22 by us district 
judge john parker 
parker made his ruling settling the nations oldest pending 
desegregation lawsuit after two days of hearings during which white 
parents demonstration against consolidation and black parents 
demonstrated for it 
there is no question the st helena school board has been 
operating in violation of the constitution of the united states 
parker said in his ruling the board now has come with its own 
proposal to consolidate all schools in the parish and this means 
desegregation will be accomplished 
in some areas these schools are not fit for a doghouse the 
judge added 
the suit was filed in 1952 by john hall whose 14 children all 
attended black schools and the national association for the 
advancement of colored people that was even before the us supreme 
courts landmark ruling in the case of brown vs the board of 
education of topeka kan that ruled that segregated schools are 
inherently unequal 
about 70 percent of the 2040 children now in public school are 
black although the parish population is about 51 percent black st 
helena parish is northeast of baton rouge the state capital 
the school board saying it could no longer afford segregated 
schools combined seven schools into three one for kindergarten 
through fourthgrade students one for grades 58 and the high 
school 
most of the adjustments are at the elementary school said 
perry spears the parishs first black superintendent of schools and 
one of only three black superintendents among louisianas 64 parish 
county and two city school systems 
the elementary level also was where most of the obvious problems 
were kindergarten and the first four grades were consolidated at 
what had been st helena elementary a predominantly black school 
three other elementary schools were closed two for blacks and one 
for whites 
why couldnt they have waited i went into two classrooms and 
neither have lights they have wires all over said shirley 
blackwell whose second and fourthgrade sons had attended a closed 
white school 
kindergarten teacher kim chadwick who came from a closed school 
said her new classroom had no heat one of her two windows wouldnt 
open there were no electrical outlets painting was incomplete 
clothes racks werent up floors hadnt been cleaned and the play 
area was so full of cars that recess was canceled 
spears said all of the parishs schools are substandard but the 
four closed schools were the worst 
i think today is excellent for a start and i expect to see 
changes of attitudes in the next couple of days the 
superintendent said 
larry self a senior who had attended predominately black st 
helena high said there hadnt been any conflicts 
i play basketball and thatll work out once we get to know each 
other when we learn each others moves he said

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address saturday 
my fellow americans on monday i submit to congress my final 
budget its a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without 
touching social security weakening defense or reducing benefits to 
the needy and the best news is that this budget proves it can be 
done without raising your taxes 
our growing economy will in the next fiscal year produce 84 
billion in new revenues with no increase in tax rates since the 
whole economic pie is expanding the federal governments slice 
grows along with the private sector raising taxes would be the 
surest way to kill the economic goose that lays the golden eggs so 
i leave as i came deadset against any new taxes and even if 
there were a tax increase history shows that congress would almost 
certainly spend the additional money it couldnt be used to reduce 
the deficit it would just mean that you had to pay for an even 
bigger government and now with an estimated 84 billion new 
revenues coming in we can both reduce the deficit and increase 
federal spending 
by combining new revenues with previously scheduled reductions 
and savings in other areas priority programs will grow by nearly 
50 billion there are more funds for air safety fighting crime 
housing the poor and the war on drugs funds for aids research and 
prevention is increased by 24 percent and money to clean up toxic 
waste goes up by a fifth we also increase funds for the science and 
space program and for basic biomedical research and student aid 
funds are increased again bringing it to a level 83 percent higher 
than where it stood in 1980 
real defense spending is increased by 2 percent this is a small 
increase but an important one the price of peace and security for 
america through strength we achieved greater realism in the 
ussoviet relationship and breakthroughs in arms reduction our 
defense budget will enable us to continue on this path lets 
remember that despite the internal reforms in the soviet union they 
are modernizing their weapons at a rapid pace spending a far larger 
share of gross national product on weapons than the united states 
does 
spending on medicare and medicaid will increase by 10 billion in 
the next fiscal year but if the past is any guide the headlines 
will claim weve actually cut funding well taint so in 
washington when spending goes up less than had been projected they 
call that a cut even though more of your tax dollars are being 
spent than ever before with medicare weve simply limited the 
increase in payments to providers of services there is no effect on 
the people who receive the benefits 
so my fiscal year 1990 budget provides for the needy does not 
raise taxes and by controlling the growth in spending reduces the 
deficit next year by nearly 70 billion this not only meets the 
grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction target it reduces the 
deficit even further and puts us on track to a balanced budget and a 
modest surplus by fiscal year 1993 this budget is a realistic 
program which protects the working families of america provides 
adequate support for those who depend on government and helps 
assure americas prosperity in the years to come 
ive often spoken of the rising income americans have enjoyed in 
recent years but one group lags behind according to a new report 
by the bipartisan commission on federal salaries real pay for top 
level government jobs has fallen by 35 percent since 1969 due to 
inflation while private sector pay has outpaced inflation so my 
budget includes higher pay for vital positions ranging from judges 
to scientists to elected officials this increase is still less than 
what was lost to inflation even after this raise the real income 
of a circuit court judge will be 19 percent less than in 1969 
the cost of these increases will be absorbed in the budget 
without slowing progress in the deficit and well be getting 
something important in return when salaries are too low its hard 
to attract and keep americas best in government federal judges are 
leaving the bench in record numbers partly because theyre paid 
less than junior members of law firms 
the national institutes of health that fight cancer and other 
grave diseases have vacancies for senior researchers that have been 
empty for 10 years due to poor pay also troubling is that some 
officials particularly in congress now supplement their income 
with special interest honoraria payments my support for the pay 
increase rests on my firm belief that such payments undermine the 
integrity of our government and should be abolished we must be 
willing to pay for excellence in government or risk a government 
run only by people of wealth or by those beholden to special 
interests 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

true bipartisanship in every area of our foreign policy and i 
pledge to presidentelect bush the unstinting cooperation of the 
congressional leadership in seeking that end

evils entirely in this coming year but if we have the will we can 
make significant progress against all three deficits both of our

eliminate the annual budget deficits that threaten our economic 
future both democrats and republicans made contributions last year 
to landmark trade legislation let us not abandon that effort until 
america attains the objective of a revived industrial base 
this is going to be a very busy and productive year in congress 
i am determined that as far as the speaker can influence the 
schedule were going to perform our work on time as we did last 
year the house will pass all of our regular appropriations bills 
before the beginning of the august recess 
now we in congress hope that the next administration together 
with us will usher in a new era of cooperation and good feelings

secretary of state george p shultz urged more than 
140 nations saturday to keep chemical weapons technology out of 
terrorists hands and he took steps to smooth relations with west 
germany over a libyan plant said to be developing poison gas 
addressing delegates at unesco headquarters shultz lamented 
the dangerous spread and resurgent use of one of humanitys most 
dreaded and dreadful forms of warfare 
he urged the imposition of un sanctions against countries 
violating the 1925 geneva protocol banning use of chemical weapons 
he said the un secretarygeneral should be armed with broad powers 
to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in wartime 
shultz said the past quarter century has seen the erosion of 
international norms in the middle east southeast asia 
afghanistan and the persian gulf 
this he said was a dangerous step backwards for mankind for 
reason for civilization 
shultz did not single out any country by name but it was clear 
libya was one of his targets 
some governments which have been known to sponsor terrorism 
now have sizable chemical weapons capabilities he said libya is 
on the state departments list of nations sponsoring terrorism 
despite a tacit ground rule against name calling at the 
conference foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran made a 
vitriolic attack on iraq for using chemical weapons in the persian 
gulf war velayati demanded to know whether iraq would be cited in 
the conferences final communique 
the war the most recent verified use of chemical arms was 
obliquely referred to by other speakers foreign minister roland 
dumas of france reminded delegates that high quality discussion 
was needed for a successful congress 
outside the conference hall shultz made arrangements with west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher for the united states 
to present evidence in washington supporting allegations that west 
german firms are involved in building a plant in libya that will 
produce chemical weapons 
we will do everything in our power to prevent german nationals 
and german companies from cooperating in a foreign country in 
chemical weapons production genscher said 
west germany has insisted there is no hard evidence of german 
involvement in the plant at rabta 60 miles southwest of tripoli 
which libya says will produce pharmaceuticals a spokesman for 
chancellor helmut kohl complained friday of a campaign in the us 
media against west germany 
shultz said he was certain the west germans were approaching the 
problem with great seriousness and if they find there is a 
need for adjustments in their legal framework they will do that 
he referred to export controls on technology transfers that some 
us officials said failed to keep sensitive technology out of 
libyas hands 
the fiveday conference at the headquarters of the united nations 
educational scientific and cultural organization is aimed at giving 
renewed political impetus to negotiations that have been going on 
nearly two decades in geneva negotiators are seeking a convention 
banning the development production stockpiling transfer and use 
of chemical arms 
the time has come to take concerted political action at a high 
level un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told the 
conference all nations large and small have an equal interest in 
working for a world without chemical weapons 
the deliberations were delayed for a minutes silent tribute to 
emperor hirohito of japan whose 62year reign ended with his death 
saturday at age 87 
the us dispute with libya over the rabta plant tended to 
overshadow the gathering of foreign ministers and ambassadors from 
more than 140 nations 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on his arrival 
friday said without proof no government has the right to 
present such accusations as those the united states has made 
against libya 
he also complained that the us downing of two libyan planes 
over the mediterranean on wednesday poisons the atmosphere for 
the conference 
in his speech shultz said terrorists access to chemical and 
biological weapons poses a growing threat to the world 
he urged delegates to join me in committing our governments not 
only to prevent the use of chemical weapons in armed conflict but 
also to prevent the spread of chemical weapons to terrorist groups 
he renewed a us pledge to observe the 1925 protocol signed by 
118 countries and said nations possessing chemical weapons should 
join in preventing these weapons from spreading and being used 
 
only the united states and the soviet union have acknowledged 
manufacturing and storing arsenals of chemical weapons 
presidentelect george bush has vowed to seek an international ban 
on production provided it can be verified 
the soviets two years ago announced sharp reductions in their 
stockpiles 
officials stress that the conferences final communique to be 
issued wednesday is political in nature and that binding 
agreements must come from geneva negotiations in geneva are due to 
resume next month at a 40nation disarmament conference

ten years after its forces marched into 
cambodias capital of phnom penh vietnam on saturday hailed the 
planned withdrawal of its remaining 50000 troops 
the vietnamese communist party newspaper nhan dan praised the 
pullout as a convincing proof of the steady growth of the peoples 
republic of kampuchea or cambodia 
cambodias government was installed jan 7 1979 when hanois 
troops ousted the communist khmer rouge from power 
in a speech friday marking his governments decade in power 
president heng samrin of cambodia announced vietnam would withdraw 
all its remaining forces by september if a political settlement to 
the cambodian war is reached 
vietnam has repeatedly pledged to withdraw the troops earlier 
than its original target date of 1990 but it had not previously set 
a date 
the vietnamese newspaper said the decision made jointly by the 
two countries is a new testimony to good will and determination 
to achieve an equitable solution 
the anniversary celebrations began friday with speeches by 
cambodian and vietnamese leaders in phnom penh public buildings 
had been painted and streets swept clean 
nguyen van linh general secretary of vietnams communist party 
said friday the total withdrawal must be undertaken simultaneously 
with the cessation of foreign military aid to all cambodian sides 
and of the use of foreign territory as sanctuary against the 
cambodian people 
heng samrin said his government hopes other countries will keep 
promises to end aid and sanctuary to the khmer rouge and two other 
noncommunist guerrilla groups such promises have been made by 
china which arms the guerrillas and by thailand which gives them 
territory for bases 
these agreements must be carried out under effective 
international supervision the president said 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk was quoted as saying 
however that vietnamese pledges of withdrawals are false that 
peace talks have failed and that cambodias future can be settled 
only by continued fighting 
vietnams announced intention to withdraw its troops has raised 
fears that the khmer rouge the most powerful of the resistance 
groups would seize power again 
vietnam which initially had an estimated 200000 troops in 
cambodia claims to have made annual withdrawals since 1982 it says 
the largest came in 1988 when all advisers and 50000 soldiers 
returned home

president reagan takes his last shot at 
ordering national priorities when he sends congress his final 
budget a 115 trillion spending plan that purports to cut the 
federal deficit to the lowest level of his administration while 
keeping taxes at their present level 
sounding many of the presidents favorite conservative themes 
the budget being laid out monday will propose eliminating 82 
government programs while protecting his defense buildup and 
recommending a big increase in spending for the spacebased nuclear 
shield known as star wars 
i leave as i came dead set against any new taxes reagan 
said saturday in his weekly radio address 
its a responsible plan which cuts the deficit without touching 
social security weakening defense or reducing benfits to the 
needy reagan said 
and the best news is that this budget proves it can be done 
without raising your taxes raising taxes would be the surest way to 
kill the economic goose that lays the golden eggs reagan said 
the budget also will address two of the governments most 
pressing problems the costly bailout of the savings and loan 
industry and the cleanup of contaminated nuclear weapons production 
facilities 
reagans budgets often have been declared dead on arrival by 
skeptical members of congress and the new document is being branded 
as even more irrelevant since presidentelect bush can rewrite the 
whole thing if he chooses to after he takes office jan 20 
i think well pay very little attention to the reagan budget 
and really focus on whats coming from bush said sen james 
sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
but reagans budget director joseph wright insists the reagan 
budget will serve as an excellent starting point for the new 
administration many republicans on capitol hill agree 
it will be a tough classic reagan budget said sen pete 
domenici of new mexico the senior republican on the senate budget 
committee it proves that even with an increase in defense you can 
reach the deficit targets without higher taxes 
like bush reagan does not favor any new taxes and the reagan 
budget leaves social security untouched something bush also has 
pledged to do 
reagans budget for fiscal 1990 which begins next oct 1 calls 
for a deficit of 925 billion if that projection holds true it 
would be the smallest deficit of the reagan era the deficit was 
737 billion in fiscal 1981 but that figure resulted from policies 
put in place by reagans predecessor jimmy carter in fiscal 1982 
the first budget year for which reagan bore responsibility the 
deficit rose to 1279 billion and has been higher than that in each 
subsequent year technically carter also submitted the 1982 budget 
before he left office in january of 1981 but it was the reagan 
administration that dealt with congress in shaping the final 1982 
spending plan 
reagan has called the string of deficits which hit a record of 
221 billion in 1986 his biggest disappointment while in office in 
a speech last month reagan said the deficits which have almost 
tripled the national debt during his presidency were the fault of 
an iron triangle this alliance among congress the news media 
and special interest groups frustrated his attempts to bring 
spending under control reagan said 
sources who spoke on condition they not be identified by name 
said the final reagan budget will seek to abolish the interstate 
commerce commission reduce subsidies for the amtrak railroad 
passenger service and privatize some of the regional power 
authorities all ideas reagan has pushed without success for years 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said none of the more 
than 80 program eliminations being sought will surprise anyone 
we have talked about eliminating these programs for eight years 
and have not been able to do it he said 
reagan also will seek to save about 5 billion by slowing the 
growth of medicare the program that provides health care for 33 
million elderly and disabled social security recipients the 
reductions would not mean higher outofpocket costs for patients 
but would come from reducing payments to doctors and hospitals 
in addition the administration is seeking savings of 11 
billion in the medicaid program which pays the health costs of poor 
people 
some areas will be in line for spending increases under the 
reagan budget reagan will propose boosting defense spending 
authority to 306 billion representing a 2 percent increase over 
the rate of inflation something that bush and congress are likely 
to scale back the reagan proposal will seek about a 50 percent 
increase in spending on the star wars nuclear shield 
also in line for spending increases will be aids research 
modernization of the nations air control system and more funds for 
orbiting a manned space station 
reagan will seek a 900 million increase in cleanup and upgrading 
of the nations nuclear arms plants and will propose spending around 
10 billion in 1990 on the cost of closing or merging hundreds of 
failed savings and loan institutions 
the budget also will call for a 50 percent pay increase for 
members of congress and other top federal officials 
if current government programs underwent no changes except to 
take the cost of inflation into account the federal deficit would 
be 127 billion in 1990 the administration estimates 
the deficit for the current fiscal year is projected to be 155 
billion the same as the deficit in the 1988 fiscal year which 
ended on sept 30 
the administrations projected 925 billion deficit would more 
than meet the grammrudman deficit target of 100 billion for 1990 
the law sets deficit targets for each year leading to a balanced 
budget in 1993 
in addition to spending cuts the budget proposes to raise 6 
billion from the sale of government assets including two naval 
petroleum reserves and a package of government loans held by the 
public 
the administrations projection of meeting the grammrudman 
deficit target depends on a set of economic assumptions that many 
private economists consider too optimistic 
i think reagans final budget is going to give us rosy 
scenarios older sister pie in the sky said gary best head of 
omb watch a nonpartisan group that monitors the office of 
management and budget 
by contrast the congressional budget office is predicting the 
deficit in 1990 will hit 141 billion 
the cbo expects the economy as measured by the gross national 
product will expand 29 percent this year compared to an 
administration forecast of 32 percent economic growth 
the difference in economic assumptions is even greater in the 
years beyond 1990 with the cbo projecting sluggish growth of around 
22 percent each year through 1994 a full percentage point below 
the administrations assumptions 
where the administration sees the budget deficit shrinking to 
only 9 billion by 1994 even without any spending cuts or tax 
increases the cbo forecast reflecting its slower growth estimates 
puts the deficit that year at 122 billion 
bush is expected to adopt the administrations economic 
projections when he submits his own spending proposals to congress 
in two or three weeks bush has said he will set forth his ideas of 
attacking the budget deficit at a joint session of congress shortly 
after he takes office jan 20

under all the glitz at saturdays opening of the 
north american international auto show are 700 cars and trucks 
showing that rounded shapes have taken charge and the rolling box is 
becoming a thing of the past 
its obvious that everyone is hitting the aerodynamics heavy 
ron dalton of ann arbor said looking over the displays at the show 
which runs through jan 15 
just look at the cadillacs said dalton who added he prefers 
fords theyre starting to soften the lines even on the big ones 
they arent bulky boxes anymore 
automakers talk a lot about performance suspension and safety 
but most american car shoppers look for other things said analyst 
ron glantz of montgomery securities in san francisco 
people buy cars for three reasons price looks and 
reliability he said 
and appearance is what an auto show is all about there are no 
test drives and some of the cars cant even be touched 
there are new versions of old cars like the oldsmobile cutlass 
series and completely new cars like the ford thunderbird and 
mercury cougar there are traditional luxury cars like cadillac and 
mercedesbenz and there are highpowered sports cars like jaguar 
and a new corvette 
there are two new imported luxury car lines at the show 
toyotas lexus and nissans infiniti which wont be in showrooms 
until next fall 
a common thread is exterior design 
the lines between the roofs and windshields and doors are barely 
noticeable rear windows flow smoothly into trunk lids and 
redesigned underdoor panels add to a sleeker appearance 
smooth design also moved into the popular minivan segment in 
general motors corps new line of plasticbody allpurpose 
vehicles for 1990 including the pontiac trans sport the oldsmobile 
silhouette and the chevrolet lumina 
i think that they are going to be dynamite vehicles glantz 
said there are a lot of advantages to having a plastic body you 
dont have a rust problem and it resists minor dings 
and some people just want to have something newlooking he 
added 
will an oldsmobile buyer like it thats a pretty traditional 
buyer glantz said but i tell you the pontiac buyer will love 
it 
while watching a white trans sport revolve slowly on a turntable 
at the show cheryl boily of windsor ontario said its 
definitely different 
it looks like a jet she added saying she and he fiance are 
looking seriously at minivans 
the changes in design toward smoother cars is due in large part 
to changes in manufacturing and engineering technology along with 
new materials 
whats feasible to manufacturers continues to expand said 
analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york 
part of it is the metal stamping equipment glantz said 
in the golden age of us car design we used thick steel with 
very generous curves it didnt fit very well 
we went to simpler dies and less handwork and thinner steel and 
that evolved into a boxierlooking car he said its more 
sophisticated engineering you have to have much more precise dies 
standing beside a maroon audi 200 at the show were kevin and sue 
burt of westland the first thing that strikes me about the car is 
the outside sue burt said 
its the silhouette she added i dont like boxy cars

friendly relations between the chinese and palestinian people 
china long a plo supporter is one of the five permanent members 
of the un security council arabs want the five to oversee 
arabisraeli peace talks at an international conference 
qatars foreign ministry said its decision to grant embassy

uprising in the west bank and gaza strip on saturday issued a

their just cause and support for the plo in every way until the

drivers trying to get their cars checked 
before an antismog crackdown begins say they have waited in line 
for hours and even days for the fiveminute inspection 
ive come four times so far jose reyes said heatedly as he 
got out of his battered white 1976 rambler at one of the 32 
governmen stations now im plain nervous 
the government and environmentalists say mexico citys 3 million 
vehicles account for 80 percent of its pollution which regularly 
exceeds maximum acceptable levels for ozone 
starting monday the city says cars visibly contaminating the air 
will be stopped fines equal to 20 days minimum wage or about 76 
go into effect for violators feb 1 even if they have a sticker 
certifying their cars are smogfree 
to obtain a sticker a driver must pass muster at one of the 
inspection stations set up across the city inspections are free 
until feb 1 after that theyll cost about 380 the equivalent 
of one days mininum wage 
reyes said thursday he had waited from just after midnight until 
4 pm and had yet to get his inspection he said he came in at 4 
am another day and found too many already in line 
at a larger station drivers said they had been in line only 30 
minutes but longer waits seemed to be the rule 
at a parking lot in the south part of the city 160 cars were in 
line at 10 pm one night for the next days scheduled 9 am 
opening already more than the station could handle in a day 
miguel angel martinez said he was given a march 4 appointment at 
the la viga station in southcentral mexico city id be in 
violation by then he said 
a few drivers said some stations were issuing stickers in 
exchange for bribes when cars failed the test 
adela rodriguez said her car failed its first check but the 
inspector tried to sell her a sticker for 1750 she offered him 
11 but he turned it down her car passed a later inspection 
eduardo rodriguez waiting in line with his 78 dodge said a 
similar thing happened to a friend whos a chauffer and took some 
company cars to a station according to them they werent 
properly tuned and they charged 20000 pesos 875 for the 
sticker rodriguez said 
newspaper reports said places in line were selling for up to 
20000 pesos responding to complaints mayor manuel camacho solis 
on friday urged citizens to report incidents of corruption to city 
officials 
taking action against pollution is good but id like to see 
one of those buses come in here rodriguez said watching a yellow 
and brown city bus as it trailed a stream of black smoke from the 
pipe on its roof 
the testing so far is required only of private vehicles which 
account for 80 percent of mexico citys vehicles in 1987 private 
cars carried only 18 percnt of 25 million daily passenger trips 
according to official figures subway buses trolleys light trains 
and taxis provided the other transportation 
at the parking lot where reyes was waiting drivers had taken 
matters into their own hands 
vilma romero a young volunteer wrote license numbers on a 
waiting list for the first available appointment time eight days 
later she told drivers to come two days ahead to confirm the date 
and the next day to pick up a number 
the plan included leaving cars in line overnight to assure their 
position a guard was being paid about 45 cents apiece to watch 
them but some drivers said they were staying anyway 
heated arguments resulted when newcomers tried to jump the line 
reyes complained there was one mobile unit instead of two and it 
didnt open on time 
theres nothing of what they have promised he said the 
people are obeying all the orders why dont they do their part

sikh militants shot and killed 14 hindus 
in punjab state apparently to avenge the execution of two sikhs 
convicted in the assassination of prime minister indira gandhi 
police said saturday 
at least three other people also were killed by suspected 
militants in the northern state friday night 
three to four sikhs carrying ak47 rifles friday raided four 
hindu homes in badowal village and shot down 10 people said police 
superintendent govind ram they separated the male members from 
others and shot them from pointblank range he said in a 
telephone interview one woman was injured in the firing when she 
tried to save her husband he said 
a note left by the killers said it was the first revenge killing 
for the hanging of satwant singh and kehar singh who were hanged 
friday 
ram said the note written in punjabi threatened more killings 
badowal is 19 miles north of the sikh holy city of amritsar 
in another attack sikh militants shot and killed four hindus and 
injured two others at sarai amant khan village saturday said police 
superintendent suresh arora 
the village 14 miles northwest of amritsar is close to the 
pakistan border 
militants also were blamed for the killing of one sikh a 
christian and an unidentified man in separate incidents in the state 
overnight 
in other violence a railway station was set ablaze and rockets 
were fired at a police patrol police and news reports said no 
casualties were reported 
the killings bring to more than 50 the number of people killed in 
punjab last week in 1988 more than 2400 people were killed in 
attacks blamed on the militants 
sikh militants fighting for an independent state since 1982 had 
threatened a wave of sectarian violence if satwant singh and kehar 
singh were executed 
the government has placed tens of thousands of police and 
security forces on alert throughout northern india including new 
delhi authorities said 
the supreme court on saturday ordered the ashes of the executed 
sikhs be immersed into a river under police supervision it is an 
important religious rite for hindus and sikhs 
the men were cremated at new delhis tihar jail after authorities 
refused to hand their bodies over to relatives 
sikhs make up only 2 percent of indias 880 million people but 
they are a majority in punjab they claim sikhs are discriminated 
against by indias hindu religious majority which comprises 80 
percent of the population 
mrs gandhi was killed in november 1984 in apparent revenge for 
an army raid she had ordered on the golden temple in amritsar 
sikhisms holiest shrine in june 1984 
the temple was being used as a base by the militants troops 
killed more than 1200 people mostly sikhs in the operation

honkytonk music knows no boundaries 
according to musicians opposed to creation of a music district 
musicians in the audience of a city council meeting last week 
applauded the establishment of a music commission but members of 
the austin federation of musicians expressed concern that the panel 
charged with overseeing creation of a music district downtown might 
only benefit business and real estate interests 
musicrelated businesses in the district could receive incentives 
such as the waiver of development fees and lowinterest loans said 
randy mccall president of the 750member federation 
trying to translate that into a benefit for the citys working 
professional musicians just kind of strains my credulity said 
mccall 
eric doc butler a guitar player and music producer said he 
does not think the commission will help local musicians 
i dont think the music district makes much sense weve got 
areas all around town that are real active in music that are 
excluded from the districts boundaries he said 
bob meyer owner of concept music agreed 
i think assigning it to a specific location is going to cut out 
an awful lot of people who could otherwise participate in it im 
concerned that its going to wind up being in the best interest of 
real estate owners and not musicians he said 
councilman max nofziger who proposed the commission could not 
be immediately reached by telephone at his home or office

world leaders sent japan messages of condolences and some 
declared states of mourning after emperor hirohitos death saturday 
but painful memories of world war ii still generated criticism of 
the japanese monarch 
president reagan said hirohitos 62year reign spanned one of 
the most tumultuous and yet at the same time constructive eras in 
the history of mankind 
it was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation his majesty 
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two 
peoples to an end reagan said referring to hirohitos decision 
to end world war ii 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union sent his 
sincere condolences and profound sympathy to the japanese 
people 
his twosentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilities 
with what still is known officially as militarist japan the 
kremlin currently is striving for better ties and increased trade 
with japan 
india declared a threeday national state of mourning in honor of 
hirohito and norways king olav v announced a threeweek court 
mourning president francois mitterrand of france opened an 
international conference on chemical weapons with a minute of 
silence 
but some reaction to hirohitos death was cool in south korea 
which endured years of harsh colonial rule by japan 
while president roh taewoo of south korea sent his condolences 
a government party statement added we reserve further comment 
considering the unhappy past and the current koreajapan 
relationship 
china extended condolences and taiwan said it will send a 
delegation to the funeral 
but taiwans daily united evening news said 
it was an irony that while hirohito apologized to the united 
states and europe for the war he did not direct a single word to 
china to show his sorrow 
most historians believe hirohito was a powerless figurehead but 
had approved orders that led to the attack on pearl harbor and put 
most of east asia under an often brutal japanese rule hirohito 
called on his nation to surrender in 1945 
the emperors death drew mixed reaction in the netherlands which 
lost more than 20000 people under japans wartime occupation of the 
former dutch east indies 
the government said it sent its sympathy for the loss that has 
befallen the japanese people without mentioning the name of 
hirohito branded a war criminal by survivors of the wartime 
occupation of the colony that became indonesia in 1949 
to many war victims only now has world war ii finally come to 
an end said gen ruud boekholt chairman of the august 15 
commemoration foundation a group representing 127000 dutch 
citizens who underwent japanese internment 
daily they still feel the pain of the wartime suffering that 
was inflicted on them in the name of emperor hirohito boekholt 
told the associated press 
but indonesian president suharto cabled his condolences to crown 
prince akihito hirohitos eldest son who immediately ascended the 
chrysanthemum throne and said he will personally pay the last 
homage to hirohito presidential spokesman moerdiono said 
pope john paul ii expressed his condolences and sent telegrams to 
hirohitos family vatican radio reported 
queen elizabeth ii said she was saddened and prime minister 
margaret thatcher said she shares the japanese peoples sorrow but 
opposition lawmakers said britain should boycott his funeral 
no one should go to that funeral from this country said ron 
brown a lawmaker of the opposition labor party who denounced 
hirohito as a war criminal of the worst kind 
it would be a grave insult to the many men and women 
imprisoned in slave camps he said many of them died but those 
who survived still suffer today 
king juan carlos of spain king faisal of saudi arabia and other 
persian gulf monarchs king birendra of nepal and sultan mahmood 
iskandar of malaysia also sent condolences to akihito 
brazil called hirohito a superior symbol of the japanese 
nation its culture and its anxieties in a period of drastic 
transformations in the world and his country and in a time of grave 
new challenges in the world

col moammar gadhafi on saturday called for 
talks with the united states on defusing tensions and warned that 
military force does not pay especially with libya 
a us official brushed aside the libyan leaders call but did 
not rule out the possibility of talks 
also saturday the government took three busloads of journalists 
to a plant that the us government claims is intended to produce 
chemical weapons libya said the plant at rabta 60 miles southwest 
of tripoli produces pharmaceuticals 
the reporters allowed only were to view the unlit building from 
the buses which drove through the complex without stopping 
later saturday the government ordered visiting foreign 
journalists out of the country however journalists then were told 
they could stay until sunday it was unclear why the government 
issued the order and then apparently changed it 
gadhafi who had not been heard from or seen since wednesdays 
us downing of two libyan jet fighters surprised about 200 foreign 
journalists at tripolis waterfront al kabir hotel 
reporters and photographers scrambled over sofas pushed over 
potted plants and took shortcuts across an ornamental fountain in 
the lobby to approach the libyan leader as he entered some people 
were knocked to the ground 
patrons in a nearby coffee shop pressed against the window to 
catch a glimpse of gadhafi 
libya will not give in to the pressure of a superpower even if 
this confrontation lasts 1 million years gadhafi said speaking 
softly in arabic and surrounded by bodyguards 
america must understand that her policy of surrounding us and 
using force against us will absolutely fail he said 
they must negotiate with libya directly and they should sit at 
the negotiating table with libya without their weapons to achieve 
peace in the mediterranean 
wednesdays incident occurred over the mediterranean the united 
states said two navy jet fighters shot down two libyan warplanes in 
selfdefense libya said its planes were unarmed 
i think the bush administration will be able to do this because 
they will have learned their lessons of the previous administration 
there have been enough lessons they will have learned that force 
does not pay especially with libya gadhafi said 
we will not respond to force only to politeness and direct 
negotiations he added his comments were translated to english by 
an information ministry aide 
a senior reagan administration official attending a chemical 
weapons conference in paris responded communications is not the 
problem the problem is libyan policy 
but the official speaking on condition of anonymity added i 
am not ruling anything in or out 
gadhafi whose country is represented at the paris meeting told 
reporters he would participate in efforts to ban chemical weapons as 
long as the campaign was aimed at all countries not just libya the 
meeting is aimed at adding political impetus to a 1920 geneva 
protocol outlawing use of chemical weapons 
pressed about the rabta plant gadhafi said only libya is 
opposing the use of chemical weapons 
journalists got only a fleeting view of the rabta plant 
two separate surfacetoair missile sites were nearby as well as 
a radar station atop a barren ridge overlooking the highway tanks 
and an encampment of soldiers were also in the area 
an unidentified libyan official said the radar soldiers and air 
defense batteries were put in place after reagan threatened the 
plant last month 
however the radar station was a permanent facility on a concrete 
base not a mobile unit 
gadhafi has offered the united states a onetime inspection of 
the rabta plant but the reagan administration said such a visit 
would be inadequate because the plant could quickly be modified to 
hide evidence of chemical weapon production 
the times of london reported saturday the rabta plant is geared 
more to the production of chemical weapons than to medicine because 
of its location configuration and surrounding surfacetoair 
missiles 
the plant is close to the libyan technology center which the 
paper said the cia suspects is capable of producing or modifying

a jury has ordered two lawyers to pay a total of 
12 million in damages for mishandling a medical malpractice case 
a baltimore circuit court jury on friday deliberated 45 minutes 
before finding former law partners herbert l singleton jr and 
robert f dashiell negligent in the case brought by arthur and 
shirley stokes whose 16yearold daughter evon died in october 
1974 after minor surgery 
the medical malpractice case originally filed in 1977 was 
dismissed in 1980 for what a judge concluded was a lack of activity 
by the lawyers handling it 
dashiells lawyer charles martinez said his client would 
appeal dashiell has since joined another baltimore law firm 
singleton who represented himself during the trial had his 
legal license suspended indefinitely by the maryland court of 
appeals in february 1986 for neglecting another clients case 
according to stephen snyder an attorney for the stokeses 
singleton admitted deceiving mrs stokes in her daughters case and 
told the jury he had planned to pay her by accumulating money 
through other cases 
evon stokes died after surgery at lutheran hospital to remove a 
cyst from the base of her spine snyder said the surgery should 
have been minor but the girl was given excessive doses of 
anesthesia and died shortly after being taken to the recovery room 
because hospital employees failed to properly monitor her heart 
rate breathing and pulse he said 
the 12 million verdict is the largest legal malpractice award 
given by a jury in maryland snyder said 
in may 1987 the baltimore firm of venable baetjer and howard 
agreed to pay 27 million to settle a legal malpractice lawsuit 
filed by the state of maryland but that sum was not awarded by a 
jury

flight attendants forced the cancellation of 
a united air lines newarktolos angeles flight last week when they 
heard of a sabotage threat shortly before passengers boarded 
authorities said saturday 
the seven members of flight 49s cabin crew would not fly tuesday 
night because the airline did not adequately explain the threat 
said cindy yeast a spokeswoman for the association of flight 
attendants the crews union 
i think the flight attendants felt threatened ms yeast said 
saturday i just think it was an oversight on uniteds part 
it points to how important communication is in a situation like 
this 
the state department had informed united that the us embassy in 
oslo norway received threats against jan 3 flights from new york 
to los angeles the airline said saturday no specific flight was 
identified according to the airline 
for most of the day tuesday united briefed crews leaving from 
laguardia and kennedy international airports in new york city and 
newark international about safety precautions but united officials 
apparently overlooked an information session with flight 49s cabin 
crew said ms yeast 
she said the flight attendants learned of the threat just minutes 
before passenger boarding was to begin the plane a dc10 with 198 
booked passengers was scheduled to depart at 945 pm and was the 
last united flight out of newark 
i think the process tended to break down after people went home 
for the day ms yeast said adding that airline officials 
continued to perform diligent baggage checks 
rob doughty a united spokesman said saturday from chicago that 
he could not comment on the crew briefing procedures for security 
reasons 
we have an excellent security program part of that is not 
to discuss it publicly doughty said 
doughty did not know how passengers were notified of the flight 
cancellation but he said 138 of them were accommodated overnight at 
hotels and departed the following day the plane a dc10 with 198 
booked passengers was scheduled to depart at 945 pm 
airline industry officials said saturday they did not expect more 
such cancellations despite sensitivity to sabotage threats 
following the bombing of a pan am jet over scotland more than two 
weeks ago 
we dont think thats an appropriate response on the part of 
the flight crew said steve hayes spokesman for the 
washingtonbased air transport association an industry trade group 
we just think that airline management and the intelligence 
community are in a better position to make a threat assessment and 
to decide what the response should be hayes said 
ms yeast said the union had confidence in security measures 
i dont think this is something that may be repeated by 
flight crews she said i dont think that every flight attendant 
group goes through the situation is going to walk off they were 
a victim of several circumstances

iranian authorities hanged 19 narcotics 
traffickers some publicly in an antidrug drive in which more than 
1000 people were rounded up and dozens killed in shootouts iranian 
news reports said saturday 
there are no official estimates available but officials have 
reported that drug abuse rose alarmingly during the 8year war with 
iraq irans crackdown began after the aug 20 ceasefire 
the official islamic republic new agency monitored in nicosia 
said 10 smugglers were convicted of running drug trafficking 
networks carrying illegal weapons clashing with security forces 
and possessing a total of 167 pounds of heroin and 1166 pounds of 
opium 
the agency said some were executed in tehrans qasr prison and 
others publicly hanged in banihashem square in the northwest 
suburbs it did not say when 
tehran radio also monitored in nicosia said nine other 
convicted smugglers were hanged friday and saturday in other iranian 
cities 
these included mashhad in the northwest near the afghan border 
and kerman and zahedan in the southwest a major smuggling route 
from neighboring pakistan 
iran television on saturday night showed interviews with some of 
the condemned men before their hangings 
they were seated at what appeared to be school desks and some 
tried to hide their faces from the camera 
one was asked if he had known the penalty for his crime was 
death i am an illiterate and didnt understand what was going on 
my father didnt have anything so i committed this act he said 
another man whose name also was not given said he was a truck 
driver who was offered the equivalent of 12000 to carry narcotics 
from a provincial town to tehran i was tempted it was purely 
materialistic he said 
the radio said several of the men executed were kingpins in major 
narcotics rings operating in the southwest one of the main targets 
of the crackdown 
a statement by the office of the islamic revolutionary prosecutor 
in charge of the antinarcotics campaign branded the executed men as 
the best examples of the corrupt on earth 
the executions were carried out in advance of a tough new law 
that takes effect jan 21 under which the death sentence is 
mandatory for anyone caught carrying 30 grams just more than 1 
ounce of heroin morphine codeine or methadone or smuggling more 
than 11 pounds of any narcotic 
any person who is found responsible for addicting another faces a 
minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment 
the expediency council set up by revolutionary leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini in february to speed up legislation snarled in 
tehrans bureaucratic machine announced the new law dec 5 
in addition to the persian gulf war other likely factors in the 
rise in drug smuggling and opium growing include a ban on alcohol 
worsening unemployment and the breakdown of political control in the 
first years of the islamic revolution

a 14yearold boy who died of starvation 
despite his parents having nearly 4000 in savings was buried 
saturday before a handful of strangers 
eric cottams family was unable to attend they were in hospital 
beds under treatment for malnutrition 
his parents larry and leona cottam have been charged with 
criminal homicide in the death the boy died tuesday night after the 
family hadnt eaten for 42 days larry cottam told police 
larry cottam 39 said he didnt use 3775 in cash bonds and 
bank accounts to buy food because it was a tithe belonging to god 
according to an affidavit filed by state police cottam a former 
seventhday adventist preacher believed god would provide for his 
reclusive family acquaintances said 
the private 10minute graveside service was attended by nine 
people said hubert morgan a seventhday adventist pastor who 
conducted the service he said his wife a local funeral director 
and six pallbearers also attended and none of them knew the boy the 
church paid for the boys burial he said 
its tragic that he was cut short in life that he didnt get 
to enjoy a full life morgan said he said larry cottam told him 
he wanted the service private and requested that relatives in 
california not be present morgan said he didnt know how to contact 
them 
the time and the location of the service were kept secret to try 
to keep away the media and others who wished to attend 
a lot of members of the congregation wanted to go not out of 
curiosity out of sympathy morgan said in a telephone interview 
a spokesman at geisinger wyoming valley medical 
centerwilkesbarre said larry cottam was in fair condition and 
leona cottam was in serious condition their daughter laura 12 
was listed in serious condition at mercy hospital 
eric whose dream was to become a meteorologist was 5foot10 
and weighed 69 pounds when he died 80 pounds less than normal 
luzerne county coroner george e hudock jr said 
his brief life was dominated by his family neighbors and school 
officials said 
he and laura scored extremely well on standardized tests but 
since 1985 they were taught at home by their mother crestwood 
school district officials said 
cottam who was fired in march from his job as a truck driver 
said his savings represented 10 percent of his total earnings 
according to the affidavit tithes which are usually 10 percent 
are used to pay the local pastor and for evangelical work said 
frank kowalski first elder at the seventhday adventist church in 
slocum four miles from the cottams home 
kowalski said the cottams hadnt paid a tithe to the local church 
since they returned to the area in 1985 morgan said the cottams 
hadnt attended his church in slocum in his 14 months as pastor 
in 1983 cottam became an intern pastor ministering to slocum 
and three other nearby churches with a total congregation of about 
250 he was stripped of his license to preach in 1985 because of 
strained relations with the congregations 
seventhday adventists are fundamentally evangelical and take the 
bible as their sole rule of faith and practice 
i think they the cottams took the lord and tested him to the 
extreme said kowalski a building contractor from nearby dorrance 
cottam told a reporter wednesday night he blamed himself not 
god for his sons death 
he and his wife were arraigned separately thursday night at mercy 
hospital 
no bail was set and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for 
friday in addition to criminal homicide they face two counts each 
of recklessly endangering another person and endangering the welfare 
of children 
death is the maximum sentence for criminal homicide 
joseph loftusvergari executive director of the luzerne county 
children and youth services said his agency was investigating 
whether the cottams are able to properly care for their daughter

the government on saturday showed foreign 
journalists a plant the reagan administration claims is preparing to 
produce chemical weapons but the visit was a driveby view on a 
moonless night 
thousands of civilians including women and children were camped 
nearby to protect the plant from a us attack libyan officials 
said 
soldiers tanks and surfacetoair missiles guarded the site 60 
miles southwest of the capital of tripoli children in the village 
of rabta shook their fists and chanted antius slogans at western 
television cameras 
the mysterious factory has been at the center of a conflict 
between libya and washington that has threatened to escalate into 
military action fears of a us attack were heightened wednesday 
when us warplanes shot down two libyan fighters over the 
mediterrean sea 
the government had promised the three busloads of reporters a 
tour of pharma 150 which it claims makes medicine 
however officials refused to allow journalists out of the buses 
and into the building and did not drive close to the buildings until 
after nightfall the buses came about 75 feet from the unlit plant 
buildings and did not stop 
a short distance away a radar station operated high atop a 
barren ridge overlooking the highway and two surfacetoair missile 
sites 
some tanks and an encampment of soldiers could be seen nearby 
one unidentified libyan official said the radar soldiers and air 
defense batteries were put in place after president reagan said last 
month that the united states was considering military action to 
destroy the plant 
however the radar installation was a permanent station on a 
concrete base not a mobile unit 
ali ibrahim the man identified as manager of the factory 
insisted it was a pharmaceutical plant and said no foreign 
contractors were involved the reagan administration has alleged 
that a west german company and other foreign firms helped build the 
complex west germany has denied the allegations 
one libyan official said foreigners could not have an inside tour 
because wellknown companies had been involved in the factorys 
construction and the firms did not want to be subject to sanctions 
the visit to the plant appeared designed to give reporters a 
chance to see the crowds that libyan officials said were gathered 
along the road to protect the factory 
a small tent city had been set up about 2 miles from the plant 
but it appeared too small to house the crowd of several thousand 
people in the area 
a large number of cars and vans were parked along the road along 
with at least a dozen empty buses 
were standing up to reagans call to attack said ahmir 
mohammed an agriculture ministry employee from tripoli who said he 
was staying in the camp 
the children and women here are brave too he said 
the crowd included women and children people in white laboratory 
coats and men in blue jeans official libyan media has said doctors 
and nurses have been holding a sitin at the plant to protect it and 
protest us threats 
a tripolibased western diplomat said in an interview friday that 
gadhafi sent many people to the plant so that in case of an attack 
libya could claim a civilian target had been hit and women and 
children had been killed the diplomat spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
meanwhile the times of london reported saturday that the factory 
is geared more to producing chemical weapons than medicine because 
of its location configuration and protection by surfacetoair 
missiles 
the paper quoted unidentified us security sources as saying the 
united states believes the factory is designed to produce mustard 
gas and the nerve gas sarin because of chemicals stockpiled there 
pharma 150 has been built close to the libyan technology center 
which the paper said the cia suspects is capable of producing or 
modifying heavy battlefield equipment as well as manufacturing 
weapons components and munitions

to 500 percent and a 15 percent acrosstheboard sales tax it also 
made retroactive to july 1 instead of dec 1 salary increases of 50

that the plane was sabotaged by iranian terrorists aided by libya a 
west german newspaper reported saturday that the plane was sabotaged 
by an ira terrorist aided by a palestinian group and libya 
twentyeight bodies still were missing after the dec 21 
explosion that blew apart the boeing 747 over this scottish village 
killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground 
the main search area has moved east from the vast kielder forest 
near the border with scotland to harwood forest almost 60 miles 
east of lockerbie in northumberland englands northernmost county 
a police spokesman said saturdays search had found nothing 
significant 
wreckage from the explosion and crash has been found over a 
65mile stretch from the solway firth in the west to the north sea 
in the east about 220 volunteers from mountain rescue teams around 
the country have joined the troops and police 
the sunday telegraph of london said on sunday that us 
intelligence agencies believe the terrorists who planted the bomb 
came from iran and were aided by libya 
the respected weekly quoted unidentified intelligence sources in 
washington as saying hard evidence is emerging to show that 
iranian revolutionary guards sabotaged the plane in part for 
reprisal for the us downing of an iran air passenger plane last 
summer 
the newspaper said there is a suspicion that libyans acted as 
a conduit for the explosives and provided intelligence for the 
iranian team it said the information came from an intelligence 
official who would not disclose the source or details of the 
evidence 
in washington state department spokeswoman anita stockman said

new yorkbound flight 103 originated in frankfurt but passengers 
and luggage switched planes in london 
a spokesman for the british department of transport which is in 
charge of the investigation said saturday he knew nothing of the 
bild report and that he believes it is speculation 
british authorities have dismissed numerous and often 
contradictory media accounts of how and where and by whom the bomb 
was planted saying those questions remained unanswered 
bild said the ira planned the bombing with a group called the 
peoples front for the liberation of palestine led by terrorist 
ahmed jibril 
bild which is known for good government sources in bonn but has 
often been inaccurate in the past said the terrorist was trained in 
libya it said libya also provided the explosives

the central figure in two 
federal inquiries involving washington dc mayor marion barry jr 
has denied using drugs with the mayor a newspaper reported saturday 
the virgin islands daily news also quoted charles lewis as 
defending his role in a heavilycriticized joint venture between the 
governments of the district of columbia and the virgin islands 
lewis a former district of columbia and virgin islands 
government official was the target of a police drug effort on dec 
22 after a maid at his washington hotel complained he had offered 
her drugs in exchange for sex an undercover attempt to buy drugs 
from lewis that day was called off after barry showed up at lewis 
room 
however lewis denied offering drugs to the hotel maid in 
exchange for sex the newspaper said he was quoted as saying that a 
misunderstanding arose when he was looking for writing paper to 
complete a job application 
there was a service tray with writing paper on it and i asked 
the housekeeper in the presence of two maintenance men in spanish 
if i could have the paper 
when i got the paper off the tray a light piece of plastic 
probably a used disposable shower cap fell off the tray and i 
picked it up to give to the housekeeper lewis told the daily news 
she started acting funny he was quoted as saying 
lewis said barry was in his room later to help him find a job 
lewis who had not spoken publicly about the incident until the 
press account saturday remains at an undisclosed location his 
version of the story differs little from that of barry who said he 
was simply visiting an old friend at the hotel 
barry has denied using drugs with lewis and said he was unaware 
lewis was under police investigation 
federal investigators are trying to determine whether barry 
thwarted a separate police investigation into the matter why he was 
visiting lewis at the hotel and whether lewis was using or selling 
drugs 
barry has denied interfering with the citys drug investigation

has expanded his inquiry to include the citys involvement in a 
260000 joint venture between the city and virgin islands 
government to upgrade the islands personnel system 
lewis headed the project but was fired in april after virgin 
islands officials became concerned about cost overruns stephens is 
trying to find out whether city officials working on the project 
charged personal items and expenses to their account with the virgin 
islands government 
in his daily news interview lewis said the reason hotel costs 
for the personnel project were so high was because virgin islands 
gov alexander farrelly was slow with paperwork which put the 
project into the busy season when rates are higher 
the daily news quoted farrelly as saying friday that he fired 
lewis because he was dissatisfied with the pace of the

a group formed saturday appears to challenge local 
activists seeking autonomy in the baltic republic of latvia where 
the communist party chief says independent organizations are causing 
ethnic divisions 
the new latvian organization the international front held its 
organizing congress in riga the latvian capital tass the official 
soviet news agency said preliminary data indicate the group is 
supported by 300000 of the republics 26 million inhabitants 
the new mass organization proclaimed its main goal to promote 
and further extend the perestroika reform program tass said 
referring to the campaign for economic and social change mounted by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
however latvian nationalists and activists say the group is 
dominated by ethnic russians and is intended to be a counterweight 
to the latvian peoples front which is seeking greater autonomy for 
the baltic republic from moscow 
they are antiperestroika said boris sokolov a rigabased 
member of the democratic union an independent group seeking to 
challenge the political monopoly of the communist party 
at a thursday meeting of the latvian partys central committee 
the republics party chief janis vagris seemed to distance himself 
both from the peoples front and the international front 
according to staterun radio moscow vagris said various public 
organizations had emerged lately in the republic such as the 
peoples front where ethnic latvians constitute a majority and the 
internationalist front made up mostly of people of other 
nationalities living in the republic 
the existence of such groups has been causing ethnic 
stratification in latvia he said 
both movements have some extremistminded elements vagris 
was quoted as saying both also involve members of the communist 
party which means that there is also stratification within the 
party 
he said that was impermissible and called on the 
organizations to lose no time in renouncing confrontation and join 
forces instead in promoting the process of perestroika radio 
moscow said 
despite vagris criticisms one of the founders of the 
international front said its members were seeking ethnic harmony 
but indicated the group will seek to remain outside party control 
when creating the international front we proceeded from the 
fact that the interests of the working people of various 
nationalities largely coincided while differences between them were 
not antagonistic tass quoted anatoly belaichuk as telling the 
saturday congress 
it means we can jointly work for the victory of perestroika 
initiated by our communist party said belaichuk a rector at the 
riga institute of civil aviation engineering 
ethnic latvians make up 54 percent of latvias population 
according to the most recent official data obtained in the 1979 
soviet census ethnic russians total 33 percent of latvias 
population while 5 percent are ukrainians 3 percent byelorussians 
and 3 percent ethnic poles

on the most beautiful and wild of the states 
rugged beaches lie hundreds of sea birds wrapped like mummies in 
heavy oil some are moving others are not they are victims of the 
secondlargest oil spill in washington waters 
the oil that poured from a barge dec 22 was thought to have 
dissipated at sea after some of it moved onto the southern 
washington coast 
but a storm just before new years brought the oil rushing back 
to shore fouling 300 miles of coastline including the pristine 
northern beaches of the olympic peninsula and on vancouver island 
british columbia 
i think its kind of outrageous that this can happen said 
melissa seymour of forks as she helped clean a beach where she and 
her family go regularly 
ron holcomb spokesman for the state ecology department said 
saturday more than 6400 birds have been recovered from washington 
beaches about 4000 of them dead an estimated 85 birds have been 
cleaned and released and 675 more have been washed scientists say 
more than half of those washed are likely to die 
some of the estimates had been revised downward saturday based on 
more complete information officials said 
hundreds more contaminated waterfowl have been recovered from 
beaches in oregon and british columbia while uncounted others 
probably died at sea 
damage to other parts of the ecosystem is less obvious and 
probably less severe but it may take months to evaluate said david 
kennedy a biologist and oil spill expert for the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration 
currents along the washington coast shift to the south in the 
spring and could deposit even more oil on beaches 
in a few years maybe these beaches will be back to normal but 
the effects will be seen for months if not years to come said 
chuck janda chief park ranger for the olympic national park in 
some areas the oil will always be there on rocks or on logs to 
serve as a reminder 
many of the dead birds are taken away in bags by volunteers so 
that bald eagles and other birds of prey wont eat them and be 
poisoned the live birds that can be captured are placed in other 
bags waiting for a bath that may save their lives 
two persistent birds cleaned and tagged were released at an 
area without oil only to be picked up again reoiled at a beach 
farther north 
the spill that occurred off grays harbor when a tug collided with 
an oil barge it had been towing at first appeared limited to 70000 
gallons environmentalists were relieved when most of the oil swept 
back out to sea with only a bit clinging to the grays harbor 
estuary where many species feed 
but last weekend it turned out that as much as 231000 gallons 
had spilled and the storm drove it shoreward blackening more 
beaches mostly to the north 
birdcleaning centers were opened at ocean shores at neah bay to 
the north and at astoria ore 
already the accident has claimed more birds than the largest 
marine spill in state history about 4000 birds died in december 
1985 when 239000 gallons of alaska crude leaked into port angeles 
harbor from a tanker that ran aground 
damage to other life appears minimal so far experts said no sea 
mammal deaths have been conclusively linked to the spill most of 
the toxic lighter elements already had been refined out of the 
heavy oil kennedy said 
mary lou mills a biologist with the state department of 
fisheries said most of the oil will break up allowing most of the 
toxic hydrocarbons to evaporate 
ms mills was generally optimistic because the fouled areas are 
north of clam and oyster beds and a smelt spawning habitat but she 
said mussels barnacles and starfish might be affected 
gov booth gardner who toured the coast wednesday said the 
spill strengthens his resolve to oppose federal plans for oil and 
gas drilling off the coast

police arrested nearly 100 antiabortion 
protesters saturday who sang christmas carols while blocking 
doorways and jamming elevators at an abortion clinic officials said 
police dragged and carried away the protesters who filled 
hallways of a busy office building and prevented 15 women from 
entering the planned parenthood league of massachusetts clinic 
officials said 
four of the protesters fastened heavyduty bicycle locks around 
their necks interweaving the locks and throwing away the keys 
it just makes it take longer to clear the entrance 
explained protester darroline firlit it takes them a long time to 
try a hacksaw and figure out that it wont work and then get the 
fire department and send for a locksmith 
it only takes three minutes to kill a baby so every three 
minutes we save is another life 
another group of 50 to 75 antiabortion protesters also members 
of the national antiabortion group operation rescue picketed 
peacefully outside the downtown building said deputy police chief 
john coakley 
police said 92 protesters who blocked entrances to the clinic and 
refused to move were arrested charged with trespassing and released 
on their own recognizance pending arraignment tuesday 
the protest was one in a series of antiabortion demonstrations 
in massachusetts in recent months including one dec 31 in which 
about 75 members of operation rescues boston chapter were arrested 
the clinic opened three hours late at 11 am after all the 
protesters were removed and all but one of 15 patients who had 
abortion appointments in the morning waited for the protesters to be 
hauled away rather than reschedule the procedure clinic officials 
said 
about 50 members of the boston chapter of the national 
organization for women staged a counterprotest outside the building 
it would be unheardof to block a voting booth said ellen 
convisser president of the boston now chapter and it should be 
equally underheardof to block my constitutional right to enter an 
abortion clinic

gorbachev who attended the meeting according to staterun 
television presented herself as a candidate to represent the soviet

the cleanup of a radioactive house 
contaminated by a professor processing radium in the basement will 
cost 95 million and involve digging up neighbors lawns and 
possibly garages federal officials say 
it is the second major price increase for the project which is 
being financed by the federal superfund cleanup program 
in 1984 the cleanup cost was estimated at 2 million last 
august as the cleanup began officials estimated the cost at 75 
million 
a lot of the areas we are excavating turned out to be 
contaminated nanci l sinclair a spokeswoman for the us 
environmental protection agency said friday in some areas we 
went down seven to nine feet before finding clean soil 
officials found that portions of the lawns of four surrounding 
homes were radioactive 
since august contractors have been pulling apart the house and 
its lawn the house was contaminated in the 1930s and 1940s by a 
university of pennsylvania professor 
by november contractors had torn down the entire house and 
shipped it to a special dump site in utah only the lawn remained 
but that has proven to be much more radioactive than previously 
thought sinclair said 
instead of the 1000 tons of soil contractors expected to remove 
they will cart off 2200 tons to the utah dump sinclair said 
victor j janosik epa project manager said he expects the 
cleanup to be completed by may or june 
ive never seen the price of these things go down he said

bestselling author clive cussler led 200 
volunteers saturday in a search for a locomotive believed buried in 
a dry creek bed during an 1878 flood but the hunts first day ended 
with no clues unturned 
cussler said he was not optimistic after workers found only a 
part from a railroad car some tubing and what appeared to be part 
of an old farm wagon 
if i had five guys with magnetometers and lined them up wed 
find it he said but with 200 volunteers its too unwieldy 
none of them have ever worked together before 
the search was to be completed on sunday 
a kansas pacific locomotive reportedly fell 30 feet from a 
railroad bridge along with 19 of its 25 cars and a caboose on the 
night of may 21 1878 when an enormous flood struck the area 30 
miles east of denver twelve of the cars and the locomotive were 
said to have been buried in the sand 
the front brakeman fireman and engineer all were killed 
cussler who lives in golden has become somewhat of a guru to 
people who dream of discovering lost relics through his national 
underwater and marine agency the author of raise the titanic 
has located 54 sunken vessels including a dirigible 
but this is his first buried train 
he said he learned about the train from articles several years 
ago 
i put it away and filed it and i used it for a germ for my 
book night probe he said i brought a psychic out once he 
didnt spot the train but he found a target i had marked 
volunteers used shovels and handheld metal detectors while 
several archeologists and flood experts used a land radar unit to 
search 
some volunteers like curtis hotzinger of denver and his wife 
mary fedoruk said they joined the search because they are fans of 
the writer 
two backhoes dug three large holes in the creekbed in areas 
targeted by metal detectors but water filled the holes about 10 
feet under the surface 
eric walker of darwin australia found the flat car part which 
he described as a horseshoeshaped piece of metal that held a gear 
if the locomotive is found it will belong to the landowner 
cussler said 
since most of the equipment has been donated the cost of the 
search is less than 1000 said agency spokesman craig dirgo 
the town of kiowa near where the tragedy occurred was renamed 
bennett to honor two of the victims widows sisters whose maiden 
names were bennett 
local newspapers reported that about two weeks after the 
accident a man named wolfe londoner searched for the locomotive 
using a magnetized crowbar the rocky mountain news reported that 
the crowbar suddenly plunged violently into the sand dragging 
londoner with it to the astonishment of the spectators 
two hours later londoner reportedly emerged from the bog to 
announce that he had found the missing engine 8 feet under the 
ground and some distance downriver from the bridge however the 
newspaper story doesnt say the locomotive was recovered 
bob richardson director of the colorado railroad museum in 
golden has said he thinks it unlikely that the kansas pacific 
railroad would have left such a large expensive locomotive in the 
sand he said the railroad was in financial straits and human labor 
was cheap at the time the locomotive was said to be worth 18000 
by one account 
however 79yearold emma mitchell whose father was a 
15yearold railroad worker at the time of the flood thinks the 
train is still there 
my father said emphatically that nobody salvaged the 
locomotive she said 
dirgo said the most recent organized search for the train was in 
may 1953 by a colorado school of mines professor they only 
searched an area of 150 by 400 feet and didnt have the kind of 
equipment we have now dirgo said

it expected many foreign dignitaries to attend the state funeral 
meanwhile people streamed to the palace in central tokyo to sign 
condolence registers sunday morning alone 44332 people signed 
their names up to 1030 am the palace said and the throng was 
growing 
the rainsoaked streets around the palace normally quiet on 
sunday were crowded as if it was a weekday rush hour the crowds 
were quiet the stillness broken only by the chanting of a 
halfdozen buddhist monks who thumped drums and chanted prayers for 
the dead emperor 
nationwide 430000 people signed registers on saturday news 
reports said 
the government declared an official sixday mourning period many 
celebrations store sales and other events have been canceled while 
others including a rugby tournament and sumo tournament were 
rescheduled

left me griefstricken prime minister noboru takeshita said 
our sincere prayers for his recovery were in vain and i am at a 
loss for words

donned black ribbons and flags were lowered to halfstaff or draped 
with black bunting 
television networks dropped advertising and regular programs to 
broadcast documentaries on the imperial family interviews with 
scholars and politicians and reports from overseas on how the 
emperors death was received thousands of viewers called to 
complain about the changes while others simply rented videos 
many older japanese who grew up thinking of hirohito as a 
demigod expressed sorrow in western japan an 87yearold former 
imperial army soldier hanged himself saying in a note i want to 
follow the emperor in death 
i heard the news on tv and i could not stay home any longer 
said a weeping elderly woman at the palace i feel so sorry that 
his life was filled with so many difficulties i pray that he can 
rest peacefully now 
it was a shock when i first heard the news though i knew it was 
inevitable and i thought i was ready for it said tetsuji kikkawa 
65 i have really mixed feeling because i went to the war world 
war ii and many of my friends died for the emperor

district and tokyos entertainment districts were dark 
the emperors death was not expected to cause major disruptions 
in business stock exchanges canceled their saturday halfday 
sessions but officials said trading would resume this week 
officials said 15000 riot police were mobilized in the tokyo 
area to guard against possible actions by radicals as both the left 
and the right see the emperor as a focus of japanese nationalism and 
militarism leftists want the imperial system abolished rightists 
want it strengthened 
demonstrators gathered at several locations to protest the 
imperial system and the attention given hirohitos death 
police arrested 10 members among some 100 from japans largest 
radical leftist group the chukakuha on charges of possessing 
dangerous weapons after they tried to push past police lines with 
bamboo poles 
at another location in tokyo 100 people marched for about an 
hour but there were no arrests 
we dont want an emperor anymore chanted the marchers who 
carried a banner reading we shall not forget world war ii 
i could not stand the thought that people outside japan are 
going to think all japanese are emperor lovers and everyone is 
crying over his death said protest organizer ryuichi harada

members of at least a dozen roman catholic 
innercity churches were told saturday that their parishes will 
close by summer while others rejoiced upon learning they wont have 
to sit in someone elses pew 
the plan first announced in september by the archdiocese of 
detroit called for closing or merging 48 parishes the most 
widespread move of its kind in us catholic history officials 
cited declining membership a shortage of priests and the increasing 
cost of supporting the parishes 
but according to announcements at services saturday three 
parishes targeted for closing would be kept open two would be 
merged with other churches and two would remain open until their 
pastors retired 
at least 18 other parishes mentioned in the original list were 
designated as questionably viable each was given six months to 
a year to coduct a selfstudy about its future with the assistance 
of archdiocesan leaders parishioners were told saturday 
nearly two dozen other parishes that did not have saturday masses 
were to learn their fates sunday 
cardinal edmund szoka disclosed his final decisions to pastors in 
private meetings last week giving them permission to release the 
information during weekend services a formal announcement by szoka 
was scheduled for sunday afternoon 
szoka has defended the closings as necessary to wipe out a 
plantation mentality in which white pastors and lay people run 
churches attended mostly by blacks because of white flight to the 
suburbs but his home has been picketed by both black and white 
parishioners in the nations sixthlargest city 
at st theresa of avila parish which will merge with another 
parish the rev robert morand said he was asked to keep the news a 
secret until his saturday afternoon mass 
the idea is that he szoka sticks a dagger in you and says 
dont tell anybody its there until saturday morand said i 
really believe he sincerely thinks hes right but he says hes 
doing gods will he has said that often and i resent it very much 
it isnt gods will its a travesty 
attitudes were upbeat however at parishes spared closing 
thats wonderful news what a wonderful way to begin the new 
year said the rev john quinn of st lukes parish on the citys 
west side whose 70 parishioners learned saturday their church 
earned a oneyear reprieve 
we are open and here to do the lords work

emperor hirohito once venerated as a living god and 
made into the guiding spirit of a world war today died of 
intestinal cancer ending a 62year reign that saw his nation 
recover from ruin to riches he was 87 
crown prince akihito oldest of the emperors two sons became 
the 125th occupant of the chrysanthemum throne in a solemn 
wordless fourminute ceremony a sword jewels and the imperial 
seals were placed on a table in front of him and he bowed 
hirohito died without ever having shed much light on his world 
war ii role 
historians generally agree he was a figurehead who was required 
to approve decisions of the military leaders until he decided the 
japanese had suffered enough atomic bombing firebombing and 
invasion and personally announced surrender in august 1945 
his death followed a 3month illness during which reports on his 
blood pressure and temperature became fixtures of japanese routine 
and many festivities were postponed or canceled

public debate about whether they 
should work on sunday is making it hard for citizens of europes 
richest country to enjoy the sabbath quiet the bible extols and 
their constitution protects 
most west germans hew to the tradition of a day on which the 
family has coffee and cake at home and the children often are even 
discouraged from going next door to play with friends 
popular magazines and newspapers carry contributions from 
prominent people singing the virtues of sunday in church and at home 
the constitution provides special protection for sundays as days 
of rest from work and of spiritual uplift but union leaders say 
22 million in this nation of nearly 62 million people work at least 
one sunday a month 
hermann rappe head of the 630000member chemical workers union 
issued the latest call for more sunday work other union leaders 
united against him in what one called an avalanche of opposition 
rappe was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper 
osnabruecker zeitung the unions must be ready to negotiate over 
sunday work for reasons of economics 
id prefer to have businesses use their money to create jobs in 
the federal republic west germany rather than in spain or greece 
if thats only possible with more work on weekends the unions cant 
simply say no 
business representatives praised him klaus murmann head of the 
national management council called rappes comments a beneficial 
shot of realism 
leaders of the printers public workers office workers the 
mighty 25millionmember steel workers union and some others 
didnt find his viewpoint beneficial in the least 
hermann rappes position was not and is not that of the 
printers union spokeswoman ulla krauseschaeuffler told the 
associated press he has set off an avalanche we are currently in 
negotiations to block sunday work 
rainer hillgaertner spokesman for the public workers said his 
union wants to keep sunday work to a minimum because the cultural 
value of having sunday off ranks above the principle of maximizing 
profits 
ernst breit head of the dgb labor federation which has 77 
million members also has expressed public opposition to work on 
sunday 
church leaders worried about a drop in attendance have been 
steadfast in disapproval 
we stand by our previous positions lutheran church spokesman 
peter kollmar told the associated press citing the importance of 
the observance of the lords day and the cultural role of sunday 
the issue even united roman catholic and lutheran prelates in 
1984 long enough to issue a joint statement denouncing further 
expansion of sunday work 
the bible teaches us god blessed the seventh day and made it 
holy because on that day he ceased from all the work he had set 
himself to do the statement said in a citation from genesis 
remember to keep the sabbath day holy the christian leaders

more than three decades after renouncing his us 
citizenship and returning to east germany novelist stefan heyms 
american experience continues to infuse his writing and offend his 
nations censors 
from my experience in america i learned to fight back and speak 
up the 75yearold writer said in a recent interview at his east 
berlin home i learned that you dont have to take things lying 
down 
heyms critical views have resulted in a ban of almost all of his 
later works in his homeland and he has struggled for more than two 
decades with east german censors his latest book a voluminous 
memoir titled nachruf obituary has only been published in 
west germany 
because of his prominence east german officials allow him to 
publish his books in the west and to accept hard currency royalty 
payments 
he is also permitted to travel freely to the west a privilege 
enjoyed only by a select few of the nations authors artists and 
trusted party officials 
im just too well known now for them to hurt me heym said 
adding that he has won the grudging respect of party foes in his 
clashes with them over the years 
his first novel hostages was written in english and 
published in the united states in 1942 a movie based on the novel 
was released a year later while his early work received 
considerable critical acclaim most of his novels are no longer in 
print in the united states 
heym returned to east germany in the early 1950s after becoming 
disillusioned with the advent of the mccarthy era and the american 
involvement in the korean war 
i loved the united states he said 
it was the time of roosevelt and the new deal then came 
mccarthy and it all changed heym said referring to 
anticommunist hysteria sparked by sen joseph mccarthy that left 
hundreds of creative artists blacklisted 
heym the son of a jewish merchant was forced to flee germany in 
1933 after the nazis took power he traveled first to prague where 
he worked as a journalist for a variety of leftwing publications 
it was there that the young writer abandoned his given name of 
helmut flieg and created the pseudonym stefan heym in order to 
secretly inform his family in chemnitz now karlmarxstadt that he 
had arrived safely in czechoslovakia 
in 1935 he received a scholarship from a new yorkbased jewish 
organization and enrolled at the university of chicago 
he stayed on in the united states writing and editing 
antifascist newspapers in new york as adolf hitlers war engulfed 
more and more of europe he later served in the us army in a 
special psychological warfare unit in europe charged with the task 
of demoralizing the will of german troops to fight 
heym published four novels in the united states before returning 
to east germany which he said he believed at the time was the 
germany where there was the most hope that something new and 
better could be forged 
the respected hamburgbased weekly newspaper die zeit however 
in a review of nachruf suggested that other opportunistic 
considerations were also a factor in his decision to return to east 
germany 
the reasons for heyms return appear wellknown mccarthyism 
and the korean war die zeit said but another factor played a 
role a lack of artistic success in america then came the 
fortuituous invitation to return in this he saw a chance for a new 
professional beginning 
heym said that after a brief uncritical love affair with the 
fledgling communist state he turned more and more to an analysis of 
social and political problems that brought a series of stern rebukes 
from the partys leadership who rejected his calls for discussion 
without taboos 
official dissatisfication over the course of his writing prompted 
former east german leader walter ulbricht to mockingly refer to heym 
as an american writer with an east german passport 
he still frequently writes passages in english first because 
its precision and economy demands clearer thinking than cloudy 
german 
heym devotes a considerable part of his bestselling nachruf 
to detailing his battle with east german censors and his fight to 
break free of ideological limits imposed on his works 
but it is also a compelling chronicle of hitlers rise to power 
and the fate of a generation uprooted and decimated by war 
this was the most difficult book i have ever written he 
said it was an effort at selfaccounting on a scale i had never 
attempted before 
heym said he used the third person in the memoir as a literary 
device in an effort to create a critical distance to his own life 
he evokes a refined sense of history and selfirony in retelling his 
own often contradictory political development and the many macabre 
and brutal events that shaped the century 
the narrative distance also helped him come to terms with the 
loss of relatives murdered by the nazis three of heyms five aunts 
were murdered in nazi death camps along with a daughter he never 
knew many of his friends died in concentration camps or were 
executed for resistance efforts 
heym said he hoped that nachruf would someday be approved for 
publication in east germany although he predicted that it would not 
happen anytime soon the government has begun to gradually soften 
its stand on several of his earlier books approving the publication 
of two novels over the next two years

krzysztof kieslowski the director of a 
short film about killing and a short film about love believes 
the human condition can be expressed by the ways people observe and 
ignore the ten commandments 
the winner of the first european film prize who sees human 
frailty in its purest form has set out to do short films about all 
10 
but anyone expecting nicely packaged sermonettes in kieslowskis 
decalogue will find the effect quite startling 
a short film about killing contains what he believes is the 
longest murder in film history nearly eight minutes of brutality 
that he himself describes as too horrible even for a horror film 
a short film about love speaks equally of loneliness and need 
leaving the viewer scoffing at the superficiality of most 
relationships and rethinking the common assumption that true love 
brings happiness 
long one of polands leading filmmakers kieslowski has remained 
relatively little known in the west but these sophisticated and 
strange tales to use the words of one polish critic may cause 
that to change already they have brought him far more acclaim than 
he ever expected 
killing recently won the first european film award a 
statuette called the felix in west berlin the prize to be 
awarded annually in a different european city is intended to be 
europes answer to the academy awards last may the film won the 
1988 jury award at the cannes film festivallove has been 
submitted as polands entry in the oscars best foreign film 
category 
kieslowski 47 an intense ironic filmmaker whose past work has 
focused on people faced with ambiguous moral and political choices 
has finished shooting the other eight films of his decalogue and is 
editing them for statecontrolled polish tv 
its not a religious inclination to make the decalogue he 
said in an interview its just a look at how difficult it is to 
live how complicated life is 
moses came up with the decalogue 6000 years ago nobody has 
ever questioned it no ideology no politics and yet we violate 
it every day thats interesting 
interesting enough for kieslowski to work harder than he ever has 
in his life he said instead of his usual pace of one film every 
four years he is making 10 in a space of three years 
americans are always saying that if there is something good 
you should shoot it immediately and they are right thats how it 
happened with the decalogue im surprised no one ever thought 
of it earlier 
the first commandment that he completed was the fifth thou shalt 
not kill it resulted in the starkly titled a short film about 
killing the screenplay which kieslowski coauthored with a 
lawyer who is active in political causes portrays the murder of a 
taxi driver by a young criminal and the youths subsequent execution 
for the crime the initial murder lasts seven minutes 44 seconds 
film killing has its own form kieslowski said we know how 
one kills or gets killed in movies unfortunately in real life one 
has to work very hard to kill a man its hard work 
the ruthless hollowcheeked killer played by miroslaw baka 
struggles for what seems an eternity to strangle and beat to death 
the much larger taxi driver and then drag him down a river bank 
strangely by the end of the film which portrays warsaws mean 
streets at their meanest the audience is able to see the killer as 
a victim too 
in poland the film has given impetus to a drive to outlaw 
capital punishment a goal which kieslowski readily endorses 
the movie is against the death penalty because it is against 
killing any form of killing because i think that relations between 
people have become too brutal 
abruptly shifting gears from killing to love kieslowski made a 
haunting film about the crystalline love of an innocent 19yearold 
for a worldly woman in her mid30s whom he observes with the aid of 
a telescope from his room in an apartment block opposite hers 
the film which refers to the sixth commandment ends with their 
positions reversed and the woman longingly watching for the boy 
through the window love fails to bring happiness but afterwards 
they are wiser better people said kieslowski 
the critical acclaim for the films is a complete surprise he 
said 
beginning the screenplays and beginning the production we 
really did not have any idea they would go beyond poland 
kieslowski said 
they are such small films very short cheap films it 
seemed to me they were unusually local although obviously we were 
trying to give them a universal character 
killing is being shown in france and it to be distributed 
throughout europe he said it may eventually be sold to an american 
distributor for the us market 
for polish audiences watching the films there is unflinching 
faithfulness to the realities of life here from a cafe that is out 
of tea at midday to the windswept barren apartment blocks where 
families are packed like so many sardines 
however kieslowski is not striving to portray life in poland but 
values that apply equally everywhere in the world 
its the same experience for an american for a german for a 
frenchman even for a japanese everyone is afraid of death no 
matter what party he belongs to 
he said portraying such elemental universal values was his main 
aim maybe i did not always succeed but i was trying to make them 
in their purest forms 
although critical of polands political system kieslowski has 
continued to work within the statecontrolled film industry rather 
than go abroad or underground but he now avoids political themes in 
his work 
i stopped being interested in politics a long time ago he 
said i hope its for good because it set me free

for the 17 months since a disturbed man 
walked onto the knbc news set and pointed a toy gun at consumer 
reporter david horowitz he has waged a personal campaign against 
lookalike play weapons 
horowitz a 22year veteran reporter who covered the vietnam war 
for nbc has had some of his longest days and nights wrangling with 
manufacturers and retailers over toy guns that look like the real 
thing 
it was just such a phony weapon a daisy bb pistol that looked 
like a colt 45 automatic pistol that gary stollman pointed at 
horowitz on aug 19 1987 as he demanded that horowitz read a 
handwritten statement while on the air 
horowitz complied but the broadcast went nowhere after a few 
seconds because knbc news director tom capra ordered the station to 
go to black shut down the broadcast signal 
i was lucky i had my reading glasses on said horowitz 
referring to the bizarre barely legible statement handed him by 
stollman 
during the short time the incident was on the air horowitz 
calmly asked the name and hometown of stollman the son of a knbc 
reporter whose contract was not renewed that summer 
it was the only thing i could think of horowitz said i 
also thought that if i could get out a few hints to police of who 
this was and where he was from they could follow leads 
the broadcast journalist was questioned by stollman about the 
sudden appearance of the stand by messages on studio monitors 
technicians were on strike at nbc at the time and horowitz told 
stollman that while there occasional difficulties the station was 
still probably on the air 
the last lines of stollmans note stated the gun he was holding 
was a harmless toy when horowitz read that the 33yearold man put 
the pistol down and was rushed by waiting police as news anchor john 
beard grabbed the gun 
stollman later was placed on three years of intensively 
supervised probation 
horowitz meanwhile intensified a campaign he had already 
started against the marketing of realistic toy guns 
the effort almost a second career comes in addition to his 
consumer reporter job at knbc and his syndicated fight back 
television show 
burbank the city where knbcs studios are located was the first 
locality to ban the sale of the toy guns in august 1987 los 
angeles oakland and san francisco followed suit and in october of 
1988 california gov george deukmejian signed a statewide ban on 
the sale manufacture and distribution of replica firearms 
but a few weeks after the state legislation was signed horowitz 
got a telephone call from washington which told him all his personal 
campaigning was about to be crushed 
a congressional source told him that sen robert dole rkan 
had attached a rider to a latesession energy bill the rider called 
for some part of toy guns to be made of bright orange plastic and 
the federal law would supersede the tougher state and local laws 
already passed 
i took this very personally said horowitz who has 
campaigned in 15 states and as many as 30 cities across the country 
he also estimates he has received 75000 pieces of mail over the 
months on the subject of toy guns 
horowitz spent the next few days on the telephone he said a toy 
manufacturer lobbyist didnt return his call neither did dole 
although members of his staff told horowitz they were unaware of the 
impact the rider could have on state and local laws 
horowitz said sens alan cranston and pete wilson and rep mel 
levine all of california helped frame compromise wording that 
leaves tougher state and local laws in effect 
the language about using bright orange plastic remained and 
horowitz has criticized it because fluorescent orange tape can make 
a real gun look like a toy or black paint can make a toy gun look 
real 
but what i didnt want to see most of all was a bill that would 
have killed state and local legislation on guns said horowitz 
and we did get the preemption clause out of the bill 
horowitz estimates the toy industry makes 300 million annually 
from the sales of all types of toy guns 
they tell me that kids want to play with toy guns and parents 
want to buy them but the bottom line is bucks he said im not 
saying kids shouldnt play with toy guns but they should play with 
toy guns that look like toys

consumers went on a spending spree in the last 
days of 1988 but while retailers and automakers are basking in the 
glow of impressive sales gains few observers expect their good 
fortune to continue 
the nations biggest retailers had expected only a modestly good 
christmas season following nearly two years of sluggish sales but 
were pleasantly surprised when a lastminute burst of gift buying 
gave them strongerthananticipated results 
analysts estimated the retail industrys december sales rose in a 
range of 6 percent to 75 percent from a year earlier better than 
the 6 percent gain forecast before the start of the holiday season 
meanwhile sales of domesticallyproduced cars and light trucks 
soared 207 percent in the last 10 selling days of the year 
the spurt boosted total sales of cars and light trucks to 1544 
million vehicles in 1988 up from 149 million in 1987 most auto 
industry analysts had estimated us and foreign car makers would 
sell about 145 million cars and light trucks in 1988 
but despite that stellar performance ted sullivan an economist 
with wefa group an economic forecasting service in bala cynwyd 
pa said the yearend surge in auto sales was a onetime deal 
very attractive incentives by dealers kicked up the selling 
rate a bit the last 10 days of december but the trend wont last 
because interest rates and the cost of financing a new car are 
moving higher he said 
were looking for car sales to continue to weaken and they 
have weakened sullivan said noting that while cars sold at an 
annual rate of 108 million cars in early 1988 sales later slipped 
to a rate of 102 million 
auto and retail sales are watched closely as barometers of 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the gross 
national product the broadest measure of the economys growth a 
sharp drop in consumer spending could send the economy into a 
recession 
sales at general merchandise and apparel retailers began to slump 
nearly two years ago although overall consumer spending generally 
increased americans were paying more money for services and 
necessities including cars and so had less money for what 
economists call discretionary spending on items such as 
clothing and furniture 
christmas 1987 was a disappointment for many retailers and they 
went into the 1988 holiday season when they generally make half 
their annual sales with lowered expectations but consumers came 
through especially in the last days before christmas 
retail industry analysts are split now over whether americans are 
likely to resume their cautious stance 
monroe h greenstein an analyst with bear stearns amp co inc 
said consumers are in a mood to spend but at the same time he 
said the retailers recent sales gains cannot be sustained 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co predicted 
that with the holidays over consumers would again be hesitant 
one thing is certain no one will be sure about a sales trend 
until several more monthly sales reports come out 
in other business news this past week 
the government said the unemployment rate fell to 53 percent in 
december from novembers 54 percent indicating the economy remains 
robust in other reports the government said construction spending 
increased for the third consecutive month in november while factory 
orders rose modestly 
braniff inc said it would buy as many as 100 jets from airbus 
industrie in a 3 billion as part of a plan to expand the regional 
carrier which has undergone three changes in owners and 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws in recent years 
published reports said kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which is 
in the process of acquiring rjr nabisco inc was considering a bid 
to buy mcorp a texas banking firm kohlberg kravis refused to 
confirm or deny the reports which said the investment firm could 
get about 1 billion in federal aid if it acquires mcorp 
drexel burnham lambert inc was suspended from participating in 
a 500 million new york city bond issue in the wake of its agreement 
to plead guilty in a federal securities fraud probe

bond traders rang in the new year the same way 
they rang out the old with worries about inflation the dollar and 
the stubborn trade and federal budget deficits lingering like a bad 
hangover 
i think its going to be a difficult year for the financial 
markets said robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international 
he and a number of other economists are predicting that interest 
rates will head higher in the first half of 1989 due to the overall 
strength of the economy although some experts are slightly more 
optimistic about the nearterm 
the fed may do a little snugging here and there but no major 
moves are needed brusca said i think they tend to feel that 
interest rates are already high enough 
shortterm rates in particular rose sharply in 1988 reflecting 
the federal reserves desire beginning last march to tighten credit 
to prevent inflation from heating up longerterm rates remained 
fairly stable though 
that same trend continued into the first week of trading in 1989 
causing a more pronounced inversion of the socalled yield curve 
which illustrates the difference between short and long rates and 
normally slopes upward 
were seeing a flatter yield curve overall said mitchell 
held chief economist for smith barney harris upham amp co 
for instance the yield on the threemonth treasury bill has 
risen 021 percentage points to 852 percent since the end of last 
year while the yield on the 30year bond moved up only 008 
percentage points to 906 percent 
part of the reason for the rise in shortterm rates so far this 
year is that fact that the federal funds rate the interest banks 
charge each other on overnight loans has remained relatively high 
some analysts say the rise in the fed funds rate represents 
merely a carryover of yearend corporate demand for money but others 
say the fed could do more to keep a healthy dose of reserves in the 
banking system 
there are a lot of things the fed could have said and done 
and didnt said held 
still interest rates and bond prices remained relatively stable 
in the first week of 1989 trading mainly because of the dollars 
surprising strength in foreign exchange shearson lehman hutton 
incs treasury bond index which measures the price of all 
outstanding treasuries rose marginally since the end of last year 
this strength in the dollar is giving us some breathing room in 
the year said brusca 
the us downing of two libyan jets in the mediterranean this 
past week had helped push up the currency since the dollar is often 
considered a safe haven amid international tension 
the dollar still remains a major concern among bond traders this 
year analysts say since the market sentiment toward it remains 
fairly bearish a weak currency makes dollardenominated bonds less 
attractive to foreigners and often sparks higher inflation which 
erodes the value of fixedincome securities 
besides the lingering trade and budget deficits which helped 
spark the 1987 stock market crash bond traders this year remainly 
acutely worried about inflation as evidence points to a generally 
strong economy 
youre not going to see inflation falling said brusca who 
noted that the businesses are still using their plants and equipment 
to near capacity 
one bit of positive news this past week however came from the 
december unemployment data although the jobless rate last month 
fell to 53 percent dropping back to a 14year low many economists 
noted that average annual earnings remained unchanged for a third 
consecutive month and that the average factory work week declined 
that isnt symptomatic of a booming economy said william v 
sullivan an economist with dean witter reynolds inc

it is no easy undertaking but the stock market 
has been doing its best lately to dim investors memories of the 
1987 crash 
in the early days of 1989 the dow jones average of 30 
industrials has rallied to its highest levels since the collapse 
in fact the dow has moved to within hailing distance of its 
224674 close on friday oct 16 the session before it took a 
508point drop on black monday 
if the dow were to complete the mission of recouping its black 
monday loss it would naturally serve as a morale booster on wall 
street but the prospect hasnt stirred up much excitement just yet 
for one thing legions of the smaller stocks not represented in 
the dow remain well below their preblack monday levels 
the industrial average itself still stands more than 500 points 
below its peak of 272242 reached on aug 25 1987 
furthermore the markets latest advance has failed to dazzle 
some of the streets chartwatching analysts 
we would caution against characterizing this as a chart 
breakout that would suggest significantly higher levels said 
newton zinder at shearson lehman hutton inc 
as it moved to a new postcrash high zinder pointed out the dow 
remained within the confines of a gradually rising trend that has 
been in force for a year 
the skeptics also wonder how far stock prices can go while 
interest rates are high and rising 
widespread expectations persist in the financial world that the 
federal reserve will soon raise its discount rate the charge it 
sets on loans to private banks from the 6 percent level that has 
prevailed since last summer 
such a move would mark the third consecutive increase in a 
sequence dating back to september of 1987 
that in turn would invoke a warning indicator known as the 
three steps and a stumble rule developed years ago by the widely 
respected analyst edson gould 
under this rule three discount rate increases in a row signal a 
commitment by the fed to tighter credit that is stringent enough to 
put the stock market in jeopardy 
one thing which has never changed and which never will change 
in my opinion is that sharply rising interest rates will eventually 
cause a sharply declining stock market asserted charles laloggia 
a rochester ny investment adviser 
despite such concerns the dow jones industrials rose 2572 
points to 219429 in the four sessions that made up the first 
trading week of the year 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 170 to 
15796 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 336 to 38474 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 539 at 31140 
volume on the big board averaged 15339 million shares a day up 
from 11415 million the week before 
one of the first lessons a new investor learns is that the 
stock market dislikes rising interest rates said james stack 
whose investech advisory letter is published in whitefish mont 
not only does it give competing investments such as bonds and 
money market funds an edge but higher rates eventually slow the 
economy that leads to lower corporate profits 
bull markets rarely occur without favorable monetary 
conditions its very unusual for investors to mount a sustainable 
longterm advance while the federal reserve is putting on the 
brakes

wages remained flat in december as the nations jobless rate 
retreated to its 14year low of 53 percent according to a 
government report that indicates continued growth without worsening 
inflation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 375 points to 
219429 its highest point since the october 1987 stock market 
crash 
bond prices posted healthy gains the dollar also rose 
ordinarily a drop in the jobless rate scares the bond market 
because it raises concerns that the economy is overheating causing 
inflation that undermines the value of fixedincome investments 
inflationary pressures could prompt the federal reserve to 
tighten credit by boosting interest rates something that hurts both 
stocks and bonds 
but analysts said the employment gains were expected and they 
noted that average wages remained flat at 945 an hour for a third 
month that eased inflation concerns 
the jobless rate averaged 55 percent for all of 1988 down from 
62 percent in 1987 the labor department said 
that gives some support to the notion that we have a strong 
economy but it hasnt set off a new inflationary spiral yet said 
carol stone an economist with nomura securities international inc 
decembers civilian unemployment rate was down 01 percentage 
point from november hitting 53 percent for the third time in 1988 
the lowest level since the 51 percent of may 1974 
serviceproducing industries led in the creation of 279000 new 
jobs last month bringing to nearly 38 million the number of jobs 
created during the year the most since 1984s total of 395 
million the department said 
economists said inflation remains a threat 
it shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear 
said economist roger brimmer of data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting service with the economy continuing to operate 
at these levels and continuing to grow as rapidly as it is 
inflation is going to keep creeping up 
the economy continues to grow robustly and wage rates are not 
accelerating very much right now said washingtonbased economist 
michael k evans but i still think there is higher inflation 
ahead perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it we 
could get a big jolt in inflation in january 
when reagan took office in january 1981 unemployment was 75 
percent it rose to 108 percent late in the 198182 recession the 
highest level in four decades before beginning to decline 
the number of workers employed parttime because they cannot find 
fulltime work also was unchanged over the past year remaining at 
53 million 
an alternate jobless rate that includes in the labor force the 
17 million members of the armed forces stationed in the united 
states was also 53 percent last month unchanged from november 
the dollar rose sharply for a third straight day as traders 
interpreted comments by a west german official as being bullish for 
the us currency 
helmut schlesinger vice president of the bundesbank said the 
west german central bank had not intervened recently to influence 
exchange rates dealers took that to mean the bank would not try to 
limit the dollars rise but the german central bank and the federal 
reserve did sell dollars on friday 
the dollars rise helped support bond prices 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond gained 2132 point 
or about 650 for every 1000 in face value its yield which 
moves in the opposite direction from its price fell to 903 percent 
from 908 percent on thursday

concerns about opecs intentions over the next 
six months remain evident in the oil futures market but overall 
investors remain confident 
on the new york mercantile exchange the february contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil rose 
13 cents to close at 1755 a barrel friday the contract recovered 
on thursday to post a gain of 34 cents after losing 28 cents on 
wednesday 
analysts noted that although investors have appeared optimistic 
that the organization of petroleum exporting countries would stick 
to its new sixmonth production agreement prices for contracts 
between march and june showed only small gains of between 5 cents 
and 6 cents a barrel 
although there has been a steady growth in confidence prices 
still favor the nearbuy months said bob baker an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc so confidence erodes as the 
months go out 
the 13member cartel agreed late last year to cut back production 
to 185 million barrels a day starting jan 1 from over 22 million 
barrels a day a worldwide oversupply of oil has kept crude prices 
weak 
since the accord was announced prices have risen from around the 
13 level 
among refined products traded on the exchange friday domestic 
heating oil futures closed narrowly mixed analysts said cold 
weather has not affected heating oil prices significantly because of 
adequate supplies and forecasts of warmer weather 
the february contract for home heating oil closed 013 cent 
higher at 5360 cents a gallon after rising 082 cent in thursdays 
session other contract months ended the day mixed 
gasoline futures followed crude oil with the february contract
